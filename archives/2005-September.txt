Subject: [Ilugc] BSNL Broadband config for FC1
Message-ID: <loom.20050901T101620-255@post.gmane.org>

I have a BSNL Broad Band connection and i am using FC2 and have configured it
using adsl-setup.  A week before it was working fine. But, recently i am
encountering a problem.

Though, i am able to establish a connection by running adsl-start (found it out
 by checking the /var/log/messages shows the session id,local and remote ip
addresses),  I am not able to browse. I tried pinging to google, but only in
vain. It says "ping: the host cannot be found".

Note: BB is working fine under windows.

Pls could any one of you suggest me in rectifying this immediately.

bye

Try pinging an internet IP Address. For example 216.239.37.99 (google.com)
If this works then the problem is with DNS.
You have to specify DNS servers in /etc/resolv.conf

RUTE User's Tutorial and Exposition, One of best free book for 
GNU/Linux. URL: http://web.whittier.edu/jlutgen/rute/rute.html

One Day One Command 
===================

oggdec -- Decodes Ogg into PCM Audio format.

Summary:

Ogg Vorbis is a new audio compression format. It is different from
these other formats because it is completely free, open & unpatented.
It is roughly comparable to other formats used to store & play digital
music, such as MP3, VQF, AAC, and other digital audio formats.

oggdec decodes Ogg Vorbis files into PCM-encoded ("uncompressed")  
audio files, either WAV or RAW format.  For each input file, oggdec
writes to a filename based on the input filename, but with the extn
changed to ".wav" or ".raw".


Examples:

$ locate .ogg -- Search for some OGG files in your system.

$ oggdec in.ogg -- Decode in.ogg and writes to in.wav file.

$ oggdec --raw=1 in.ogg -- Decode in.ogg and writes to in.raw file.

$ oggdec in.ogg -o out.wav -- Decode in.ogg and writes to out.wav file.

Hello all,
I tried to setup my broadband conection in my RH9. When i run adsl-setup, it 
asks whether activation-on-demand or permanent connection and when i giv 
"no" for activate on demand, as it too suggested for a dynamic IP address... 
after i complete my adsl-setup and try to connect, it cannot.. when i giv 
/sbin/adsl-start ( as well as /sbin/inup ppp0). when i checked the system 
log, it showed some insmod error. Also when i cheked with the adsl-status, 
it gave me " activate-on-demand selected:" but i have given "no" for this 
one, i checked some ppp0 file in the bin where there was a line "if $DEMAND 
= "no" then "<same statement as i got with adsl-setup output>" I am not able 
to find whats wrong with mine, plz help !

Greetings!

Please don't reply to this e-mail.

This is a reminder to members of this list about the
posting rules:

1. Do not top-post

Example of a top-post:

  I think you should be swapping the arguments around

  function, instead of the way you are doing it.
  On Friday, the 13th, you said:
  > I am using the function xyz(), giving arguments
arg1 and arg2, 
  > but it does not work. Anyone know why?

Always use bottom-posting.

  >> foo foo foo
  > On Sunday you said
  > foobar

3. Do not post HTML messages

4. Do not recycle messages

5. Do not send attachments

6. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal
disclaimers

Hi,

I am assuming your adsl modem connects with the system
via ethernet.

You should use:

  adsl-start eth0 username@dataone

to connect. Replace eth0, username accordingly.

Post the output of the following before you connect:

/sbin/lspci
/sbin/ifconfig -a

Is the LED light on the ethernet?

Well, all I had to do was to enter my Dishnet user ID/password and
voila. Dial-on-demand works flawlessly.

I'd recommend that baby to anyone looking for a combo ADSL

It uses a Broadcom based chipset that features a MIPS32 CPU core. It
is also a very good gadget to have to learn MIPS programming. And it
is very well supported.

I was shopping for something else at Ritchie street and saw this
product in one of the shops there. Was told it costs 4k but when I
said I'll come some other day, was told that I can get a really good
price! Good hagglers might get it for 3.5k, I think.

You don't have a driver. Hence, there is no eth0 in
the output.
 
/lib/modules/2.4.20-8/kernel/drivers/net/epic100.0:init_module:
> insmod eth0 failed

Its trying to load the intel driver. Can you check in
/lib/modules/2.4.20-8/ (and in drivers/net) for
8139too driver?

If you don't have it then you will need to:

a. recompile kernel with realtek support

or

b. compile the realtex drivers separately from the
source code

.zip?

Check this:
http://www.scyld.com/rtl8139.html

You will need your kernel sources installed in your
system. Usually they will be in
/usr/src/linux-<version>. In your case, it will be
/usr/src/linux-2.4.20-8 or something.

One of the many things that newbies don't do while
doing a GNU/Linux installation is not install:

a. development tools
b. kernel sources

You can install the kernel sources from the
installation CDs.

Follow the instructions given in the link for driver
compilation and loading, and ask specific questions if
you are not able to proceed.

Regards,

SK

Yup. I will definitely recommend FC3.

Yeah, you really shouldn't be "handling" distros. Just
use them.

How?

If you are compiling from source, you only need to do
"./configure; make".

Only "make install" will move the executables to PATH
that might affect the package management repository of
your distro.

Can you post the error? You might want to use -L in
the Makefile or set LIBS to point to the existing one.

You really shouldn't be touching these files, unless
and until you are really, really sure on what you are
doing.

Hi,

Well, the ubuntu package manager(i.e. synaptic) is pretty good, and
contains most packages that u wud want - read the 'Extra Repositories'
section in www.ubuntuguide.org to make hte available package database
even bigger. Using the package manager is really easy.

> *********

Well, normally u wudn't need to modify ld.so.conf, unless u r
installing libs in an unconventional location, for example I have some
libs in /opt/lib, which I added to ld.so.conf.

Doing a 'ldconfig -p' should give u list of all the libs ldconfig
knows about, see if glib is present in that. On my ubuntu machine, I
seem to have glib 1.2.10 installed.

Would also recommend getting checkinstall, so that u can easily
uninstall packages installed from source.

Well, since Ubuntu is a Debian derivative, you should be apt-getting, wherever
possible, unless that package isn't available in Ubuntu or you have some
special requirement (in which case you can still apt-get get source... but
that's a different matter...)

In Debian, apt-get install libglib1.2-dev will solve this.

And, about XMMS, I can't imagine Ubuntu not having xmms, so you can just say
apt-get install xmms as well.

HTH.

P.S. Sorry Sudarshan, this will be your second copy of this message. I

Have you configured it properly? I mean with the appropriate
Access Point, ESSID, etc. Check `iwconfig`.

I must really thank Mr.Shakthi Kannan for coming to our college and
also to give an excellent talk even a time constraint. I hope this

Thanks for all your time and help.

welcome;
just inform them that you dualboot , mostly into linux, that you need a suitable modem;
invariably they give you a single port ethernet router, its very easy config; good for dual boot; DLINK router is mostly used by these guys;

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0509041619070.12900-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

The Linux Cookbook provides lot of Tips and Techniques for Everyday 
Use. This book is available in On-Line and Printed form.
URL: http://dsl.org/cookbook/

One Day One Command 
===================

nice -- Run a command with modified priority.

Summary:

GNU/Linux is a multi-user and multi-tasking OS. So many processes will
be running with some scheduling policy like Round Rabin, FIFO etc..
High priority process will get more CPU Time.

nice command is used to run the given command with its scheduling
priority adjusted. Priority range goes from -20 (highest priority) 
to 19 (lowest priority).

Examples:

$ nice -- Prints the current priority value.

$ nice ls -- Increment the priority value of the ls command 
             by 10 (Default value) and run.

$ nice -n 5 ls -- Increment the priority value of the ls command
                  by 5 and run.

# nice -n -2 ls -- Decrement the priority value of the ls command by 
                   -2 and run.

NOTE: Incrementing the priority value will reduce the priority level 
      and vice versa. Priority range is -20 (high) to 19 (low).

Subject: [Ilugc] Lighter and flexible alternative to "gnome-volume-manager"
Message-ID: <9a9bfc170509040549683e76ca@mail.gmail.com>

I was looking at a light, flexible and powerful alternative to
gnome-volume-manager, preferably non-gnomified. Troubling with
googling is that "volume manager"  etc. throws up scores of results
about lvm and something like "auto mount", obviously, autofs stuff.
Does someone know an alternative ?

it moves on...

PS: if you are puzzled by the combination of "light" and "powerful",
it would say something like using xterm instead of gnome-terminal.

Subject: [Ilugc] Guidelines for software freedom day from
	Softwarefreedomday.org
Message-ID: <ed2d3c0005090412472a3c0c87@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Friends,
The following are the guidelines prescribed by the 
www.softwarefreedomday.org <http://www.softwarefreedomday.org>, Volunteers 
are requested to go through and have these points noted.


Some guidelines to make SFD a positive celebration:


   - DO present the capabilities and practical benefits of FOSS.


   - DO NOT pretend that FOSS is perfect for everyone or everything.



   - DO have the ability to present FOSS ideology clearly and concisely 
   to interested people.


   - DO NOT beat uninterested people over the head with ideology; this 
   will confuse and intimidate them. Instead...
   


   - DO let the quality of the software speak for itself and its 
   ideology.



   - DO have demo machines present if possible.



   - DO your best to connect people with a local FOSS community.



   - DO provide contact information for your SFD team so people can 
   subsequently contact you for

more information.


   - DO get contact information from interested and willing people, so 
   you can proactively follow-up with them later.



   - DO proactively follow-up with people who attend your SFD event.



   - DO find and cooperate with other SFD teams in your area.



   - DO start other SFD teams in your area - this cooperation, not 
   competition!



   - DO NOT -- seriously -- DO NOT bash Microsoft or SCO or any other 
   false Great Satan.
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/microsoft.html>Software Freedom Day is
not about any individual companies or people;
   Software Freedom Day is a positive community celebration of Software 
   Freedom.




Cheers,

Fedora is multi lib capable. If you are using the 64 bit versions, many 
libraries also have their 32 bit equivalents installed for compatibility 
reasons

I assume your are a stage three user .Which ISO's did you download? Did you 
also download package CD? If you did, did you do...

export PKGDIR="where_you_mount_the_cdrom"

emerge --usepkg/--usepkgonly gnome

Otherwise, portage will try to download it from the net.

hi parth,

wht does ifup eth0 say, since u have the drivers check if u have the alias 
defined in 

/etc/modules.conf 

or

/etc/modprobe.conf

it should have an entry like this,


alias eth0 8139too

also check the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
can u post both the above files.


i don't think recompiling is necessary.



regards,

kiran

Hmmm.... so you use splashimage. I had the same problem with genkernel. I 
was lazy to look for solution and since I consider it really not necessary, 
I just removed it.

Subject: [Ilugc] Problem installing Ubuntu in Acer N4151NLCi Laptop
Message-ID: <431D2462.1040700@iitm.ac.in>

I've been having some trouble installing Kubuntu (Hoary) in Acer 
N4151NLCi Laptop.

It boots from the CD Drive perfectly but when it comes to detecting and 
mounting it, i get an error message that says 'no common cd-rom was 
detected' and asks if i want to load drivers from a floppy. Of course, i 
don't have  floppy drive. :)

It comes preloaded with Linpus Linux and
dmesg gives
Philips CD-RW/DVD-ROM SCB5265
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.20

The great Google pointed me to a few postings where folks said that it 
has something to do with sata and ati_piix and advised a change in the 
BIOS from SATA Automatic to Enhanced. The only problem is Acer ships it 
with a cheapo bios that does not allow me to do all this.

The interesting thing is Debian 3.1 detects the CD-ROM perfectly and let 
me proceed with an install (I aborted it after the CD-ROM detect step).

Any help will be appreciated!
Thanks

put me out of this yaar.... i never knew installing gentoo would be so
difficult ... it takes gosh toomuch time and finally gives an error
messagee.. :((

i was said, it is really fast...but i didnt checkout yet....

Well, did you set PGKDIR variable? Do you have the package CD? I don't know 
which, but the package does have a lot of pre-compiled binaries.

Fast... hmmm.. depends on how well you customised it to suit ur hardware. 
You could actually mess up things instead of speeding up. It's not an 
overnight work.

I did have the package cd. but didn't really use it.

Check out the section.

I am using Thunderbird both for office laptop (windows xp) and home 
desktop (kubuntu 5.04). Fine and simple to configure. Very good in junk 
filtering.

You can, by adding the cvs repository roots to the --allow-root option in 
your /etc/xinetd.d/cvspserver file. I am assuming here that you are running 
a pserver with xinetd. The syntax is pretty much the same with tcpserver 
etc. Here's a sample /etc/xinetd.d/cvspserver

service cvspserver
{
socket_type = stream
protocol = tcp
wait = no
user = root
passenv = PATH
server = /usr/bin/cvs
server_args = -f --allow-root=/opt/repos/project1 
--allow-root=/opt/repos/project2 pserver
}

Hmm, my previous mail was actually about how to serve different repositories 
using the same pserver. You question, I realized is different. Sorry ...

I guess you misunderstood me. I wanted a light program which could
automount usb drives, cd's etc. using hotplug/hal. For a window
manager, I am quite happy with enlightenment :)

First, please ask a better question. What do you mean by `continuous'?

Try checking the options/preferences, and compare amarok's preferences
with other players' configuration. Then, if things don't work, ask
with more info about the problem...

sir
either way --ie., first while trying stupidmode on it gave the same results as with trying
the next ie., stupid mode = 0 (on the advice of the modem maintainer of linmodems.org);
do you feel any tweaking is to be done?

Try either:

1. Slackware

http://public.planetmirror.com/pub/baslinux/slack81.html

2. Damn Small GNU/Linux

Yes, it does ... always.

Dude, it has 16 MB RAM.

You can try running X through framebuffer too,
something like Xfbdev KDrive Tiny X server:

but when i am passing psaux as argument its not accepting???
I removed many parts of my kernel which i thought it was irrelevant,
initially my boot sequence was giving kernel panic error, saying its
unable to determine the boot device...
all my linux partitions are in reiserfs, so i removed ext2 and made ext3
as module, and reiserfs is compiled to kernel along with proc and
virtual memory file system....
but since i was getting kernel panic, i recompiled my kernel with ext2
in kernel along with ext3 and reiserfs etc and now the kernel is running
fine.

Now it he devices of kernel, i selected only PS/2 mouse support and
didnt select the legacy /dev/psaux ....
is this the problem y my mouse is not detected???

huh,. i have never had so much trouble installing any other distribution...
bye

Try this

cat /dev/input/mouse0

Move the mouse and see if some stuffs get printed on the screen. Also try

/dev/psaux

/dev/input/mice

Once you find our the right one, try xorgfcg -textmode

That's what I did on a desktop. Haven't done it on a laptop.

Subject: [Ilugc] usb info?
Message-ID: <1126161752.3563.31.camel@mazda>

Hi All, 

I have a few doubts on how to get  STATUS, Descriptor, interface for USB
devices in kerenl-2.6.12.

I have have seen reference in 

kernel-2.6.12/include/linux/usb.h  some API like..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* wrappers around usb_control_msg() for the most common standard
requests */
extern int usb_get_descriptor(struct usb_device *dev, unsigned char
desctype,
        unsigned char descindex, void *buf, int size);
extern int usb_get_status(struct usb_device *dev,
        int type, int target, void *data);
extern int usb_get_string(struct usb_device *dev,
        unsigned short langid, unsigned char index, void *buf, int
size);
extern int usb_string(struct usb_device *dev, int index,
        char *buf, size_t size);



However I am not able to make them work when I call this API in my
kernel module..

Also I have tried to use

EXPORT_SYMBOL(usb_get_status); --- In this case, kernel cribs to load
the symbols and module is not loaded..


Any body has some idea/reference how to get these call working?

Regards
Raja

 It is possible and simple. Just Import the Project/Directory to the
CVSROOT. (dont give existing name).

I think u confused among the difference betn CVSROOT and CVS repository....

Both are called repository but for ur clarification consider

if $CVSROOT=/home/cvsrepos    then You can import more than one
projects/modules/repository/subrepository   what ever u called.
but while import u have to give different name.

while checkout 
 #cvs checkout <repository name>

while any other command (from client side), if ur inside the directory  
no need to mention the repository name.

(Every directory contains CVS/Repository file it will take care of all the
Details)

A Maybe related tip/reminder (if you have seen this wiki before):

http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/FiveMinuteTipsBash

This  way, you  can manage  all your  CVSROOT variables  easily. Quite
useful when trying to check out new projects into your box.

Do you have usbcore module loaded (or compiled in the
kernel)? Which host controller driver are you using
(uhci, ohci, ehci)?

Post the output of:

/sbin/lsmod
cat /usr/src/linux/.config | grep USB

from your target system. Replace /usr/src/linux with
your target's kernel source code directory.

Subject: [Ilugc] A Frenchman, and maps ... in the South Pacific
Message-ID: <1126168965.3866.18.camel@localhost.localdomain>

A Frenchman, and maps ... in the South Pacific

Franck Martin [1] is a Frenchman based in the South Pacific. (You might
have noticed his sense of humour on the trip to Angkor Wat.) As a
Wikipedia contributor, he's described as someone "checking mainly the
pages of the Pacific Islands and updating when neccessary. Promotion of
wikipedia in Pacific Islands." But what's more interesting is his
Tikimaps [2] work.

http://www.iosn.net/events/fossap-2005/blog/franck

Mapserver, says Franck, is a tool, for "bringing data to all
stakeholders via Internet and Opensource Technology". It promises the
tools for e-government, good governance, transparency, sustainable
development, asset management, disaster management and security....
provided we have the political will for that. 

To see what's possible, visit some of these sites from the distant (from
us!) South Pacific islands of Tonga [3], Fiji [4], Tuvalu [5], Kiribati
[6]. Franck sees many advantages in using Free and Open Source software.
These include sustainability, licenses (Internet licences are
expensives), software support, no "black box" phenomenon (where we don't
understand the technology we use). It also allows you to rely on
standards and support many file formats (not vendor dependent). It is
reliable. And secure too, provided the administrator cares for it.

For more links on what uses Tikiwiki can be put to take a look at the
Tikiwiki Community Portal [7]. Uses include uses in educational context
[8], using the mobility features of WAP browsing or for use with a PDA
[9], and, of course, Franck's interest of maps [10].  -- Frederick

cannot set resolutions greater that 800x600, whats wrong, i searched for 
my video card drivers but I am damn sure that IT should have been fine 
since my video card is getting detected properly, and i dont want to do 
a frsh install coz i find it tiring and time  consuming. there should be 
some setting by which i can overcome this chaos,.

i ran 'setup' as root and selected 'X configuration' i chose 1024x768 
and millions of colors, but when i click 'ok' i am reverted to 800x600 
but the dialog box appears the way i wanted it to be,

This:
----------
-> Modem initialized.
--> Sending: ATDT172233
--> Waiting for carrier.
ATDT172233
CONNECT 46667
-----------
indicates the drivers are fine, but an authentication problem remains

This:
# Once there is a success, try commenting out the following line,
which is a ICW default
---------
should be on one line, it got folded in the email

This may be the problem
-------------
Username =purelife
Password =umaram
--------
a space isAALWAYS  needed after an =
--------
Username = purelife
Password = umaram

Also try without Stupid mode by commending it out.
# Stupid Mode = 1
           or alternatively
Stupid Mode =  0

Test and report back

Subject: [Ilugc] A million rupees in prizes... Collabnet is hiring... India's
	listed user groups touch 139...
Message-ID: <1126210075.3866.365.camel@localhost.localdomain>

IT MIGHT BE a bit too late to talk about an August-datelined issue of a
magazine, but ... better late than never.

          Just to highlight some of what one found interesting in the
          AUGUST 2005 issue of Linux For You magazine. Send in your
          comments and feedback to lfyedit@efyindia.org 

          INDIA IS BEGINNING to contribute to the global FLOSS pool,
          and thereby erasing the stain of being just a net taker
          rather than a net contributor. Results are just in from the
          first Code Scholarship challenge, initiated by the
          Kanwal Rekhi School of Information Technology (KreSIT),
          IIT Bombay, and Red Hat India. It is designed to encourage
          FLOSS developers in India. Some 2000 students registered.
          Finally, 34 teams bagged awards. First was VPS 1.6.0
          (Virtual Private Server) developed by the Army Institute
          of Technology, Pune. Next was Octave-GTK by the
          National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirapalli; and
          ranked third was a College Information System, developed by
          the Institute of Engineering & Technology, Hyderabad.
          Prizes totalled a million rupees in all (Rs 10 lakh!)

* An advert from Collabnet says it is hiring people with over five 
  years experience in developing or testing web-based enterprise
  applications. See http://www.collab.net/cspl.html

USER GROUPS IN INDIA: Currently, the list spreads over two pages (a few
which I tried to check out had bad links though). From 80+ the number of
LUGs, FSUGs and GLUGs has grown to 139! Next challenge: let's keep them
active! 

FOR NEWBIES: * Learn how to use Mozilla, the popular Web browser, to
find information on the Net. * GIMP, a great image enhancement tool. Get
exposed to GIMP and design whatever you want to.

Brief updates:
* PHP 4.4.0 is released
* Qt 4.0 is now available
* Firefox 1.5 on its way

TOP TEN [GNU]LINUX GIZMOS: Motorola E680i [1] smartphone with 2GB

called the Minikit [2] (camcoder, digital camera, MP3 player,
voice-recorder, memory stick and Web cam!); Archos' Pocket Media
Assistant PMA400 [3] with a 30GB hard drive, wireless Internet
connectivity and direct video recording capability from TV; and Sony
Ericsson's robotic camera ROB-1 [4] packed with a VGA camera and four

send email, SMS/MMS messages, surf the net and videoconference);
GNU/Linux-powered broadband terminal/IP phone [10] from MontaVista.

          EMBEDDED LINUX gadgets are doing great in Asia, specially
          in Japan, China and Taiwan, where major players like
          NTT DoCoMo and NEC are endorsing the GNU/Linux OS.
          Encore Software Ltd, the makers of the Simputer
          http://www.ncoretech.com and signup at
          http://groups.yahoo.com/group/simputer announced recently
          plans to launch another GNU/Linux handheld called
          Mobilis, a "mobile desktop". Mobilis family of products
          includes Mobilis STN, Mobils TFT and Mobilis SofComp.
          The first two are tablet computers, that can bridge the
          gap between PDAs and laptops. SofComp is a low-cost desktop.

THIN DOWN ON [GNU]LINUX: Linux may be struggling to break Microsoft's
stranglehold on the desktop, but the thinner, leaner and meaner thin
clients based on the [GNU]Linux OS are fast becoming the choice of both
public and private enterprise. Some popular GNU/Linux thin clients are
HP t5525 and t5125, Neoware Capio One and Eon, Netvoyager Lithium

It is very nice. Can you just add a box which will tell when our next
meetings like a.Regular monthly meet b.GLV session will be held? 

Let it be on top near the subscribe box so that people can see this
easily, without need to navigate one more page, because most people
visit our site to know meeting schedule.

Legal or illegal under the Indian IT act, it's unethical. Really, sending 
stuffs like.. "Dudes, pirated stuff here" to your local lug list. 

See, under the IT acts, you can't sue a person for sending you unsolicited 
sms (Hey, I ain't a lawyer, just what I read :-) )

Linux:
"dmesg" gives you complete hardware detected details during kernel 
loading. It is useful for debugging.
lsusb - lists all usb devices
lspci - lists all pci devices in your system. since today's machines 
uses mostly pci devices, it lists most of the devices in the system
Other Unix:
"hwconfig" - runs on unix system ( i have seen in sco-unix), u can try 
that in other unices also.

these are fine, but are there any free tools like harddrake on mandrake,
which gathers and shows all hardware information on any linux system..?

So? As a citizen of India don't you have a conscious? 

You really think _ethical_ laws are made in India, and
there is absolute law enforcement? Ah .. wake up! 

When it is not ethical, you just don't do it. Period.

Dude, it is always better to stick to tools you will find everywhere (read 
distros). Besides what our friend said above, some more in the below link,

And I could find a place only about in the middle. I guess the intro
text needs pruning.
You can edit the Intro template by going here 
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki?title=Template:MainPageIntro&action=edit

And I guess I would spend some time on cleaning up the wiki and
categorising the articles.

hi,
i somehow managed to correct my problem, heres what i did,
i selected a generic driver form system-config, rebooted and went in for 
my driver again, that solved my problem, and thanx to every1 for giving 
me clues.
i guess what i did was as same as replacing and overwriting the 
/etc/xorg.conf...

Instead of ppl not doing it becuase it against the rule/law, I would 
rather... people don't do it because it's unethical.

Gentlemen and Ladies,
I was going thru LFY Sept issue (No, I do buy the mag anymore) in Landmark 
today, was on the BraveGNU guest column by : *Frederick
noronha*<http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&q=Frederick+noronha&spell=1>when
something caugh my eyes.

Fred wrote about ilugc's own sbarathi 's One Day One Command and bit about 
Barathi. Suprisingly, Fred kept referring to Barathi as 'She' throughout the 
paragragh. With the mag in my hand, called Saha to confirm and he told me 
that the guy behind Once Day One Command is indeed a "guy".

Anyway, Cheers Barathi ;-)

Hi All,

 I cann't believe ESR could get so low......

Honestly he is making the OSS world look cheap & dirty
with these kind of remarks .... 

And to top it all he compares himself with linus & RMS
:) 

As for opensourcing the doc (& other office formats) -
MS is already working on it.... The formats will be
xml based & will be available to the public by 2007
... as per a video release on
http://channel9.msdn.com/

Overall just a rant from a desperate guy who craves
for media attention.......


regards,
Hassan.

>>> Hello all,
Are there any commands or utilites in Linux, by which
one can find out
the complete hardware information etc about a system
running, <<<

Yes.  'dmidecode' written by Alan Cox.

Dmidecode reports information about your system's
hardware as described in your system BIOS according to
the SMBIOS/DMI standard (see a sample output). This
information typically includes system manufacturer,
model name, serial number, BIOS version, asset tag as
well as a lot of other details of varying level of
interest and reliability depending on the
manufacturer. This will often include usage status for
the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI, ISA)
and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports
(e.g. serial, parallel, USB).

IMO, the best one is `d4x' (Downloader for X). There is an another
`Prozilla', but I am not sure it matches up in terms of functionality.
If you want a console tool, may be you can try `aria' (I am not sure
of this)

it moves on...

Subject: [Ilugc] xine subtitle flicker
Message-ID: <98a95a05091100345d3869b4@mail.gmail.com>

I have a very specific problem with xine. When I load external subtitles 
with a video file, and switch to an aspect ratio of 4:3, the subtitles 
flicker constantly and are rarely visible. However, a higher aspect ratio 
like Anamorphic works fine due to the space available for subtitles. Is 
there a way to stabilise the subtitles?

Repeat after me..
"Microsoft did not try to recruit ESR"

The e-mail was sent by a "vendor", a contractor type employee of 
Microsoft.The e-mail was *not* a job offer, just a mere request to meet 
up a third party firm which was doing the recruiting for Microsoft.It 
was an interview request and nothing more.

Subject: [Ilugc] Software Freedom Day
Message-ID: <f480bf1e05091107313aa291c1@mail.gmail.com>

It struck me that "Software Freedom" may mean several things,
including the idea that people have the freedom to lawfully acquire
and use any software they like.  Perhaps, it is this meaning that
should be higlighted on Software Freedom Day in future, so that it may
be celebrated by one and all in a spirit of brotherhood.  Recognising
the freedom to use any software we like would also mean that all have
a chance to be treated alike, and no person would be criticised for
his individual choice of software.  I feel this may become
increasingly apparent in the days to come.

Dear All,
The software freedom day program on 10 Sep 2005 went very well. 
The demos were very good. 
I had a oppurchunity to see lot of new developments in the Gnu/linux world. 

And the seminars also very informative. 
We must thank Thyagu who spearheaded this event related voluntory work.

FYI, Microsoft is governed by the American law on vicarious liability for the action of its vendors;In simple Indian terms, when you find an american outfit practising "vendor" concepts here, ask the company whether it will honor its "vendor's" committment; they will even give you a written committment. American companies take up the fullest responsibility for their "distributor's" or "vendors" committment to the outside world as if it were made by them, purely on their own. 
2. with the above in mind, try applying your mind once again on the topic at hand and you will now see.............

Inspite of the fact that MS's HR messed up badly, thats no way for ESR
to reply. He holds a responsible position of being a figurehead of the
FOSS community. He must have atleast thought out the reply instead of
sounding like a kid.

Add to that EPIC (Exposed Paralled Instruction Computer) which
includes the IA64.
Also, VLIW (though you can't put it in the same category as RISC/CISC)
which include the Transmeta's Crusoe (Linus worked there before he
went fulltime to OSDL).

If you are looking at computer architecture, try to get your hands on
Hennessy and Patterson (both the books). Tanenbaum is good for basics.

Friends.

In sfd, I saw more interested people.
Some old men too visited and enquired a lot.
students from Hindustan engg and Balaji polytehnic,
showed much interest on linux.

Enough machines were there.
Mr.Ramanathan helped me to get on and get back systems.

Thanks folks.
I hope we can make next LDD's more and more succesful.

Thanks thyagu and volunteers.

Message-ID: <20050912045227.90785.qmail@web8603.mail.in.yahoo.com>

 The Software Freedom Day celebrations went on well on 10th sep 2005.
Highlight of the day are
1. The seminar to School teachers: Nearly 40 teachers from about 25
schools attended the seminar. The sessions covered were -
Introduction to FOSS,HSC school Linux syllabus and installation.
2. There were roughly 80-90 visitors
3. There was unannounced seminar to over 60 students from Balaji
polytechnic. What is realy great about the students was - almost  99%
of them are using Linux - a fact totaly opposite to situations in
many   engg colleges. We have asked them to organise local LUG.


Overall it was very stasifying. 

 On behalf of ILUGC, I thank Dr.Iyamperumal,ED,TNSTC  for giving us
excellent facility, publicity and for co-ordination with schools for
delegates to the seminar. One additonal special thanks for arranging
excellent lunch. We thank the team of Scientific Officers and others
of TNSTC for the help they gave us.

 On behalf of ILUGC, I thank NRCF team for their participation, and
providing us the much needed human and machine resources.

 On behalf of ILUGC team of volunteers, I thank our 'thalaivar'
Thiagarajan for the excellent work he has done. 

 Ms.Bama, Lecturer, Anna University, donated Rs.100 for the show.

I have the universal (I think), but you have to keep a few things in mind - 
Live CD or no, to install, you still have to download all the packages from 
the Net. That in itself comes to two CDs, and that's not counting the portage 
updates. If you truly want to try it out, you need a connection with at least 
2 GB/month downloads, and preferably unlimited downloads. If you have this, I 
suggest that you download the minimal livecd (about 60 megs) and go on. 
Otherwise, Gentoo may not be right for you.

Also, Gentoo "releases" are only for the livecd, and not the distro itself. 
The distro is in a permanent state of update, and you can install an older 
'version' (as in install using an older livecd) and keep upto date without 
ever reinstalling, like you would with other distros. I took my system from 
1.4 RC 4 to 2004.something, and kept that running till about a couple of 
months back. I only reinstalled because I changed most of my hardware, and I 
wanted a bit more optimization. In other words, if you have an older livecd, 
just use it.

Dear Friends,

Warm greets, I thank the volunteer team which made the software freedom day 
a grand success.I thank Mr. Bharathi, Mr.Raman , Mr. Vijaya kumar, Ms. Padma 
priya for the speech delivered on the function. I am really proud to be a 
member of such a wounderful team which showcased the software freedom day.

We all want a change in computer software usage, as our notion is to make 
the people to make use of foss software. Any one who supported us physically 
or virtually are praised for their support. Well our next goal is to take 
this movement into rural sector, i will take neccessary steps in contacting 
the NLC (neyvelli lignite corporation) and update the thread. 

In the lunch session after having the meal , i went to the wash room and 
found one of the two wash basins were cloated with food particles,
so i used the other wash basin which was relatively clean, Mr. Hariram 
atheraya came for washing his hands and found the wash basin's cloat. He 
immediately swing into action by putting his left hand and cleansed it. i 
learnt a good lesson from his act, as the saying goes "ALL OF US WANT TO GO 
TO HEAVEN, BUT NO ONE PREFER TO DIE". I personally thank him for this act.

I thank all the ilugc members, the au-kbc team and the staffs of tnstc for 
their support.

Thanking you,

Cheers

The whole point of Gentoo is having a system that's optimized and easy to 
update. The package CD is merely a way to get going fast, and not an install 
by itself. You can't think of Gentoo like you would other distros...

The Universal livecd is for installing when you want the base system up and 
running fast. It has the final stage of bootstrapping and installing, from 
where you still have to setup the kernel and compile whatever other programs 
(X windows, your choice of desktop environment, etc) you want.

In other words, even with the universal, you still have to compile about half 
the system.

There is always the possibility of getting the distfiles (sources for 
programs) from friends and compiling them on your system (I've setup one 
system this way - it's running quite well), but that has its own 
complexities. I wouldn't recommend trying that without doing a "normal" 
gentoo install to begin with.

which i don't have the neccessary bandwidth.

- In which case, get whatever you can get from the package CD. Since I have 
enough bandwidth I ended up getting everything from the net.

In the package CD, you got the kernel, xorg, gnome, kde, editors, 
openoffice,perl, python, xfce to name a few.

Ppl go for it mainly for optimization. I am not so keen on that since I am 
not very good at that(and if one is not sure on what he is doing, he could 
actually screw up badly). The other reasons which I am very happy about it 
,is customization. I am aware of what's on my gentoo box because I put it 
there.

hmmm!
  i understand that Gentoo is all about staying updated using the latest 
distfiles . but sadly :( i don't even have a connection to the internet on 
the system tht i plan to install. But i can set up a repository of files for 
a install ( if that is possible as i have a big test network here ) . 
 so iguess ihave no other option but to go for a package cd install.
 Wht do ya say about it?
 regards,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0509121841550.795-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

Mr Vijay Kumar released Beta version of XPDF with GGI (General
Graphics Interface) Front end. Use of GGI will give the reliable,
stable and fast graphics system that works everywhere. 
URL: http://www.bravegnu.org/xpdf/  (Volunteers Needed)

One Day One Command 
===================

renice -- Alter priority of running processes.

Summary:

GNU/Linux is a multi-user and multi-tasking OS. So many processes will
be running with some scheduling policy like Round Rabin, FIFO etc..
High priority process will get more CPU Time.

Renice is used to alters the scheduling priority of one or more
running processes. Priority range goes from -20 (highest priority)  
to 19 (lowest priority).

Examples:

$ renice +1 123 -- Increment the priority value of a process, which 
                   process ID is 123.

# renice +1 123 -- Decrement the priority value of a process, which 
                   process ID is 123. (Root only can decrement ).

$ renice +1 -p 123 -p 200 -- Same as above. Here no. of process is 2.

$ renice +1 -u sbharathi -- Increment the priority value of all 
                     processes, which is owned by a user (sbharathi).

$ renice +1 -g backup -- Increment the priority value of all
               processes, which is owned by a group (backup).


NOTE: Incrementing the priority value will reduce the priority level 
      and vice versa. Priority range is -20 (high) to 19 (low).

Hello Thyagu and Friends,
 It was indeed a special experience for me and all those volunteers
who where with me. We had a satisfactory attendence at the demo stalls
we had arranged. Surprisingly the volunteers did turn up early, things
went smooth, there were crowd from the beginning till end ( proly
barthi had to stay an extra few minutes for closing on the CD
burning). A lot of poeple got their Distros burnt in CD, that we met
with a temporary insufficiency of balnk CDs. From next time, its
better to be handy with few copies of genberally used distros as well
as enuf blank CDs.
And there were also ppl who were working in computer field and wished
to learn about Linux, perhaps i had the credit of telling oen guy from
Polaris about linux.. who wanted to showcase the features of Linux in
their anual meeting and make Polaris use Linux in their workplace.
And Final one is that, hope we would get much more ppl into ILUG
chennai, especiially as volunteers as many were intersted in seeing us
in Action.

Hope that we would be geting much more similar opportunities to
portray the power of linux, i thank all those who were involved in the
LDD and SFD... Hats Off !

not to leave out the guy who came with his laptop :-) to get it
troubleshooted. Too bad we couldnt solve it though. He had this peculiar
problem that it starts the installation off the cd and then says that
the cd drive driver couldnt be found :-(

I hope he solved it. SFD was real fun though... at least a new event for
me :-)

Dear Sir/Friends,

                 I am balamurugan.i have some doubts
in kernel programming.

                  my system configurations 
os:redhat 9.0
kernel :2.4.20-8
processor:p4

            I have some doubt in interrupthandlers.the
coding which is have shown below is taken form the
book 
"LINUX KERNEL MODULAR PROGRAMMING".
         



#include <linux/kernel.h>               /* We're doing
kernel work */
#include <linux/module.h>               /*
Specifically, a module */
#include <linux/sched.h>
#include <linux/tqueue.h>
#include <linux/interrupt.h>
#include <asm/io.h>

static void got_char(void *scancode)
{
   printk("Scan Code %x %s.\n",
          (int) *((char *) scancode) & 0x7F,
          *((char *) scancode) & 0x80 ? "Released" :
"Pressed");
}

void irq_handler(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs
*regs)
{
   static unsigned char scancode;
   static struct tq_struct task = {NULL, 0, got_char,
&scancode};
   unsigned char status;


   status = inb(0x64);
   scancode = inb(0x60);
  
   queue_task_irq(&task, &tq_immediate);
   mark_bh(IMMEDIATE_BH);
}

/* Initialize the module - register the IRQ handler */
int init_module()
{
   free_irq(1, NULL);

   return request_irq(1,   /* The number of the
keyboard IRQ on PCs */ 
              irq_handler, /* our handler */
              SA_SHIRQ, 
              "test_keyboard_irq_handler", NULL);
}

/* Cleanup */
void cleanup_module()
{
   free_irq(1, NULL);
}  

    Problem:

             The problem is this program is compiled.
there is no problem in compilation.when the module is
load using insmod command, the system will be hang +
the keyboard(numlock,capslock,scrolllock)all are
blinking.

          i know what to do any body plz help me

thank u

Message-ID: <a8f9901205091222236d2e71c2@mail.gmail.com>

Sun has announced an outstanding Opteron-based 1U server at a very
competitive price of $745! First review at Anandtech:

http://anandtech.com/systems/showdoc.aspx?i=2530

The engineering and functionality is *awesome* for the price. nForce4 ultra,
Socket-939 Opteron 146 2 GHz, stock ECC DDR, IPMI support for headless
remote operation, dual removable SATA, built-in DVD drive, dual gigabit
Ethernet, PCI-e. It is dual-core upgradable and will run RHEL 4 
out-of-the-box!

The downside: No PATA, no legacy PCI. I can live with that - this is an
unbeatable Beowulf node - the most exciting box from Sun since the
Sparcstation IPX! They should have done this 3 years ago.

Hello Shakthi and Sai,
Sorry for a late reply. Here is the output of " /etc/modules.conf "

alias eth0 epic100
alias eth1 8139too

Query: Does this mean that my ethernet card is in eth1, rather than
eth0 which i hv been trying out these days?

Do you mean -debugging- ?
If it is so, you can use gdb (GNU Debugger). It is a command line tool. 
(The GUI version also available - Insight GDB)

Yes. Do check in lsmod output too that the driver is
loaded.

Message-ID: <432797D9.6070904@shaw.ca>

Hello Prem:

A lot of people seem to be searching for elusive 965L drivers.   I found 
a patch reference below  from Linux development archives.
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/patch-2.6.13-git4.log 
- the bit below is my cutout. 

Not sure if you were planning this for Linux or FreeBSD but 99% of the 
code should be similar.. if you know where to find it?

Good luck and good on you!

Graham/
Vancouver, Canada.

If you are lucky with this I would love see the finished product, maybe 
I can figure out how to compile into my FreeBSD kernel.
 

[PATCH] sis190: resurrection
    
    Raise the sis190 driver from the dead
    
    The driver handles the integrated network device found on SiS 965L
    chipset. It follows the classical (non-napi) interrupt-driven model
    and provides minimal ethtool support.
    
    The code comes from a heavy cleanup/rewrite of the original code
    which was removed from the kernel on 14/04/2004. Since the r8169
    driver does not work too bad and there will probably be (at least)
    a few months of improvements/testing/fixing, I made the code as
    close as possible to the r8169 one.
    
    Pascal Chapperon <pascal.chapperon@wanadoo.fr> deserves some special
    credit for testing and bug-catching. Many thanks to Lars Vahlenberg
    as well.

hi all,
looks like i m the last one to comment bout the LDD, sorry for that. 
though the crowd was less in number than i expected, all of them were 
intersted in GNU/Linux. we had gr8 fun, some of them still contact me 
for troubleshooting. i learnt a lot from this LDD
i cant wait for the next LDD, we were lacking in CD-Rs but, the 
enthusiasm of the visitors made them to get cds from Adyar!
I would like to thank whole-heartedly all the volunteers, especially 
mr.thyagu for making this event a grand success.

Err...when will be the next LDD taking place ;-)

regards and gnully,

Hi,
I changed the settings to eth1 and again tried to connect. The same
error is beign showed
" You have set connection on demand" But while is was doing the set up
i gave no for connection on demand. I remeber once seeing some related
file, where the was a condition stating $DEMAND = no then the message
to be displayed.

I wonder where its getting wrong ? lsmod and modules.conf modporbe
everythign shows my related driver for ethernet card 8139too. Now i
have doubt whether theres ane problem with my modemits UTStarcom
UT-300R2 modem. How can i find whether my modem is getting detected?

I am posting the output of " /etc/sysconfig/network-script/ifcfg-ppp0 " here

Hi,

      Yesterday i post one doubt,but i made one

 "I have one program which is taken from linux kernel
modular programming.While compilation there was no
error,but i could'nt run the program.when i tried to
load the module i can't load it. the system was hanged
and the keyboard LED's was blinking".why such problem
arise?

Dear All,
Shall we discuss about the certification for Linux in this thread? The 
topics can be like this:
1. What is the opinion of ILUGC members on these certification?
2. Vendor neutral and vendor oriented certification (e.g: LPI and RHCE)
3. Any certification for GNU C/C++ based development on Linux?
4. Experiences of people who have passed/attended the linux 
certification exams?
5. What is the contribution of these examination to avail a opportunity 
to get interview call for a linux job in India/Chennai?

Message-ID: <4328FFE7.5030908@frodo.hserus.net>

Be gentle with this newbie. After several years of using slackware, I
just installed Ubuntu (kubuntu hoary which then got upgraded to breezy
with apt-get dist-upgrade, blowing up around 500 megs of my 3 gb a month
bandwidth quota)

Now, I rather like it, the install process is a lot cleaner than the one
Debian has as well.

However, the default 2.6.12-8 kernel with ubuntu breezy (or the 2.6.10
with hoary) has a lot of stuff I don't need, and lacks a bunch of things
(ck, inotify etc) that I do need ..

Further, the ubuntu default kernel has a nasty way of locking things up
on my laptop every few minutes when the load is high enough to go into
swap, while applying ck + inotify patches keep it running smoothly for
me.  Actually, I use the archck patchset (these two plus a few more), as
-cko doesnt seem to be maintained now.

Anyway, I did a "fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd kernel_image" after I
patched stock 2.6.12 and did a make menuconfig, and the new kernel works
just great.  I also installed newer versions of cpufreqd, laptop-mode
-tools and the ipw2200 centrino wifi driver, (using debs available from
their respective websites).

So now all I have to do is to tell apt-get not to try upgrading other
kernels, or downgrading to antique and buggy versions of cpufreqd,
laptop-mode and ipw2200 when I next do an apt-get upgrade.

Short question is - how do I mark certain packages as "don't touch
these, I'll do it by hand" and still stay within debian's remarkably
anal retentive packaging system?

If you are using "synaptic package manager" tool, it is just select the 
package which don't want to update. And select "Lock version" option 
from menu bar (under 'packages' menu - if i am not wrong)

As suggested,
I recompiled my kernel with /dev/psaux legacy support ,
but still my X server is unable to load....????
can anyone tell me how to proceed further??
do i need to include anyother module in my kernel??
I stripped most of the unwanted modules..
I tried using gpm,, and gave the devics as psaux,,
it didnt give any message....
but in
# X - config xorg.config.new
i edited the xorg.config.new file and replaced the pointing device name
with /dev/psaux  . previouly it is /dev/mouse and /dev/mouse doesnt
exist at all....
its been many weeks i have been struggling with this installation.. :((

Read the X log file. Check the problem is bcoz of this setting or due
to some other problem. Post the Input Device Session of X Config file
to list (with-out commented lines).

   Hi peevee,

   Hope you have misunderstood my answer to Suresh Ramasubramaniam. He had
   asked for the package locking feature in apt-get (synaptic). I gave tip
   for that. It is no way related to "Big kernel lock". I am a beginner, not
   knowing anything about kernel stuff what you say. :) :) anyway i have come
   to know a new technical jargon on linux kernel.. good.. good.

The code is meant to do the above.

It clearly says this in the code itself!

You have to reboot.

I don't consider it as a means of proving one's
calibre.

If you can contribute to FLOSS projects at:

http://savannah.gnu.org
http://freshmeat.net
http://sf.net

it will show that you are really capable of
coding/development/testing, and that you can work with
programmers from all around the world.

If you continue to do the above, you will have a means
to show that your skills are uptodate and you are
working on current technologies and cutting edge.

I can't speak for others.

When you work on R&D, for instance, you can't ask for
certifications, because, you won't even have
documentation when working in this domain. You will
only have code to work with. So, the ability/skill to
understand code and hack it, is important.
Certifications don't reveal such abilities.

Regards,

SK

Bharathi and I are deciding on a good template to use.
After we decide on the template, I would change all the pages in chennailug.org
So a new look for our LUG homepage is on its way.

Shakthi and Others,
There are lotsa people in the LUG-C mailing list, like me, who are in
the state of just beginning to catch up with linux stuff. What i would
like to know is how they can develop thier linux knowledge and skills
to become atleast a novel user. If someone comes to you and wishes to
learn and become an efficient/skilled linuxian, what all would you
advice him to know.. better say what all you will ask him to learn and
practice ( step by step, ofcourse). Hope this reply would be useful to
all those passive members of the cominity who haven't yet come
forward, put questions and learn things.
( Note: this approach is with keeping in mind that they plan to learn
without moving in for certifications! )

actually there's a minor problem in libvgahw.a (a library associated
with X) in FC4 and so the virtual consoles dont work properly in FC4.

The problem is discussed here and also a soln. is provided. In case u
have FC3 u can used this file from FC3.

Hi,

My thoughts below,

It depends on what you want to use the system for and
what you want to learn.

GNU/Linux is an ocean.

a. There are some folks who might want to use
GNU/Linux as a desktop, and use it for their
day-to-day activities (office, printing, e-mail,
browsing, chat, etc.)

So, you will start of by working with different
software packages, distros, configuring them and using
them.

b. There are some who might want to go into
application development (distros, qt, gtk, scripting,
...)

How to become a hacker:
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html

c. There are some who might want to go into operating
systems/hardware development (kernel, device drivers)

C and assembly language are a must. Starting off with
device drivers is good. For VLSI and embedded that are
GNU toolchains and free software available.

Check out this link from my domain:

http://www.shakthimaan.com -> Books

d. ...

So, you have to be very specific as to what your goals
are and what you want to learn and accomplish.

SK

As specified in my page, this bug only affects specific chipsets and it 
has been fixed in a later Xorg update. Look into the bugzilla report for 
a detailed analysis

Let me put it this way, I am just little less novice than the real noobs! 
When you try something in Linux (or even anything), you got into some 
problem, what would you do?

This is what I do and would do.

*) Try to fix it from with my current knowledge
*) If it seems to be distro specific, go to the distro site , look for 
solution.
*) Search community forum/list, if there's no existing post, post it there 
,as brief and as detailed as possible. Listing out things I have tried and 
the result of each. Try my best to show my enthusiam not frustration.
*) Yea.. google of course. 

Other DO's

Also,
*) Mistakes- Everyone does, learn from it. Don't repeat it.
*) The ancient ans of course:RTFM (many people did a good job of WTFM)
*) Read articles, webpages of the masters, ESR, Benjamin Mako Hill 
(Ubuntu/Debian),
Steve(Debian-administrations.com<http://Debian-administrations.com>),
to name a few.. and of course the masters in your own local lug. 
*) Back when I was in Trichy studying, used to collect second hand mags and 
hunt for article on Linux.
*) Meet some pal with similar interesting over a movie or beer in he 
weekends, you would occasionally find yourself getting to share lots of 
stuffs. (Thats how I got to know of putty when some dude mentioned it along 
ago).
*) Read certification exam guides , but don't go for certification ;-) , 
well actually, your choice. I really enjoyed reading Steve's RHCE guide, LPI 
guides on IBM Developerworks, and all articles by Daniel Robbins (Gentoo 
creator)
*) Yea.. also ESR's How to become a hacker
*) Help others when you can.

dd -- Convert and copy a file.

Summary:

'dd' copies and optionally converts data with changeable I/O block
size. Reads are issued to the input file or device for the size of
the input buffer and writes are issued for the size of the output
buffer. This allows I/O requests to be tailored to the requirements of
a task. Output to standard error reports the number of full and short
blocks read and written.

Examples:

$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=ddfile bs=1 count=100 -- Dump random bytes in 
                                                 the file.

$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/fd0 -- Format a floppy disk

$ dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/tmp/floppy.image -- Take floppy disk image.

$ echo "12345678901234567890" | dd bs=1 skip=5 count=10 -- Skip 5 
                          bytes in input and output only 10 Bytes.

$ echo "hello world" | dd cbs=1 conv=unblock -- Take one byte at a 
time and dump it in stdout with a new line.

$ echo "hello world" | dd conv=ucase -- Change to Upper case.

$ echo "HELLO WORLD" | dd conv=lcase -- Change to Lower case.

$ echo "12345678901234567890" > ddfile -- Dummy file.

$ echo "AAAAAAA" | dd bs=1 seek=5 of=ddfile count=5 conv=notrunc -- 
Seek 5 bytes in output file and copy only 5 from input to output file.

NOTE: You can use a some input file instead of echo command.

Read: man dd

THOSE FREE CDs IN YOUR HAND, THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORTH MILLIONS

Value of Debian GNU/Linux. The paper Measuring Libre Software
studying the size of the source packages in Debian 3.1 calculates the
size of sarge (close to 230 million lines of source code), the use of
the various programming languages in which the software has been
written, and the size of the packages included in the distribution. It
also estimates cost to create something on the scale of Debian from
scratch with a classical and well-known cost method (COCOMO) to be
over 8 billion US dollar.

HI Bharathi,

I have a query on usage of this for my purpose. I have a 10 GB hdd (with 
Ubuntu 5.04) with following configuration:
/dev/hdb1 - /boot - 200MB
/dev/hdb2 - / - 4GB
/dev/hdb3 - /home - 3.5GB
Rest of the partition for Redhat 8.0 and swap.
I want to upgrade the size of root partition due to shortage of space in 
it. I have proposed to go for new hdd of 80GB atleast. Let us assume 
that the new hdd partition be like this:
/dev/hdc1 - /boot - 200MB
/dev/hdc2 - / - 15GB
/dev/hdc3 - /home - 40GB (all collections and downloads of iso and other 
files).
I want to utilize the 10GB partition solely for RedHat 8.0, so that the 
above shown new hdd can be used for Ubuntu. Can I use dd command in the 
following way to to move the existing ubuntu system to new hdd ( don't 
want to install again).
dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=/dev/hdc1
dd if=/dev/hdb2 of=/dev/hdc2
dd if=/dev/hdb3 of=/dev/hdc3
Will it work? Can I run these command while while the system is running 
on Ubuntu runlevel 1? or I have to do these when I run Redhat system?
I have installed GRUB in MBR of /dev/hdb. Apart from editing the 
/boot/grub/menu.lst file, what else I have to do?

Regards
T.KaruppuSwamy

Subject: [Ilugc] workshop for NGO on open source
Message-ID: <432A75F1.50305@ciosa.org.in>


CIOSA, (Confederation of Indian Organisations for Service and Advocacy 
is a collaborative forum for non-profit organisations,which brings NGOs, 
socially motivated individuals and  corporate houses on to a common 
platform for mutually beneficial relationships by helping, learning and 
sharing knowledge, resources and time. Non-profit organizations remain 
the central focus of CIOSA. As of now there are 120 NGOs 5 corporates  
and 43 individuals in our network.

We continuously try to built the capacities of our NGOs, as one of our 
efforts we would like to have a work-shop or seminar on Opensource for 
our members in the second week of October. In this we seek your 
assistance in developing content and organising the programme.

Our Members:

1.  CIOSA has member groups of varied causes.
  2.  From both urban and rural.
  3. 80% of them are small and medium sized
  4. Not many are computer savvy.
  5. Have problem with english.

What we Intend to achieve:

1. How opensource can help them in communication, and as alternate to 
mirosoft
2. Tamil search or interfaces.

These two may be different topic but we feel there is a need to teach 
our members how local languages can be used.

If this idea sounds good pl let us know how one can develop this and 
take it to many.

Hi,

Thanks for taking the initiative. 

Can you clarify the following?

1. How many people will be attending the workshop?

2. Which city and location do you want to conduct the
workshop in?

3. Can it be on a weekend (most of us have work during
week days)?

4. Can you provide an LCD projector?

5. If its out of city, can you provide transportation?

6. If we want to have stalls, will you provide us with
computers or transportation for computers?

If the audience is large (>400), it will be better to
have stalls for the workshop.

7. Is it ok if we want it make it a public event that
is open to all? It can be "ILUGC in association with
CIOSA".

8. Will you take care of advertising in newspapers
(especially) if you want to take it to the public?

Regards,

SK

The above o/p shows that ur card uses one ethernet controller and the
driver for that is '8139too' .

ur eth0 is not activated.

the above statements prove that ur card has not been dtected properly.

Wht i suggest is
open the /etc/modules.conf
and delete all the entries in it relating to ethX and
then restart ur system. kudzu will generate some messages tht a card
has been removed and so. slect remove configuration but in the
following screen ( if u get one :)  )  choose ignore.

after that put one entry into the /etc/modules.conf file as follows,


alias  eth0 8139too

and i guess this shouls configure ur card correctly. ( alternatively
use redhat-config-network to  add the new card.)

tell me wht the results are.


regards,
kiran

Did you try Alsa or OSS? If Alsa, did you start the Alsa daemon? Which program 
says "mixer device not found"?

Oh, and the obvious, what hardware do you have?

Just a backup of the entire root file system should be enough.

You can probably do something using dd. Like this, for example:

dd if=/dev/hdXY of=hdXY.image bs=1024 count=716800

That copies 700 MB from /dev/hdXY (depending on the partition you need to 
image) to hdXY.image. To restore,

dd if=hdXY.image of=/dev/hdXY

I don't know how to span multiple discs with this technique, but someone else 
can probably help with that... :)

Hi,
I have found after using linux for about 5years, the major problem is fonts.
It is never as good as windows. I have tried installing ttf fonts, fonts 
from windows,
KDE,Gnome all latest. but the problem remains. Whenever you open a web page 
in linux
with any browser say firefox, mozilla, opera all have same ugly looking 
fonts, no matter whatever ttf
fonts you have installed. When will the fonts in linux get better?

try nimbus roman. use mozilla. you could see a good font rendering
than windows. i like fc3 with mozilla that makes perfect combination
in terms of UI, font rendering, graphics etc

I did one such partition imaging. I tried dd and then partimage. I found 
partimage to be the best solution. I followed this tutorial:

http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/1375/

Do not use dd, it will copy each bit of data from the HDD. For 80GB HDD you 
will need big number of backup media.

Terminology, please.

What has the Linux kernel got to do with fonts?

I use Mozilla Firefox with fonts for western,
san-serif, monospace cursor. Looks good.

hi,

u need not create a new boot partition. u can use the existing one.....

wht i suggest is instead of moving the existing ubuntu to the new hdd
let it stay in there.

create a new partion on the new hdd for redhat and in addition to that
u can create one more partion say 10GB on the new hdd mount it on
/misc and then cp all the files in /usr to misc
and then unmount it. Then u can edit the /etc/fstab at mount the new
partition as /usr on the existing ubuntu. Since the size of /usr is
increased u can get very vast amount of root storages space at the
same time u can delete the contents of /usr from the original dir (
caution lest u delete files from the new partion after u mount it)

i guess the above thing should work, but no idea.  If u r trying it
tell us about the results.

In my experience fdisk from tomsrtbt rescue floppy helped a lot during

the answer is clear cut! fonts in linux are already better, if your 
fonts look bad then you must not have enabled anti-aliasing, and nothing 
beats firefox in linux when it comes to fonts. installing ttf fonts too, 
isnt a big deal, control centre in kde handles all these stuff

You *did* remember to change the settings to use new fonts, didn't you? ;-)

Try playing around with antialiasing settings - that sometimes messes things 
up. I usually exclude the 9-13pt range from AA, because that just makes it 
more ugly. That might help...

Subject: [Ilugc] any limitation for initrd size
Message-ID: <003501c5bc1e$b0ac74a0$140110ac@loguco>

Hi,

I use PXE to boot systems for rescue porpose. I have created ramdisk image 
of about 70Mb to have a complete rescue system and this initrd is not 
getting loaded by the pxelinux (from syslinux package) loader. It says 
something like "the initrd image file not" and did not give any error 
related to the size. When I reduce the size to about 10Mb or so it works. Is 
there any limitations for the size of the initrd image with respect to the 
pxelinux loader. I could not find any document related it. Also, is it 
depends on the bootstrap loader or on the kernel. I guess it related with 
the loader. Please comment on this.

Thanks

It's a well-known problem in libvgahw.a of FC4. Just replace it with
libvgahw.a from FC3, and you should be OK. The better fix is to
recompile xorg-x11 from SRPM using gcc-4.0.1, but that requires
a working FC4 or FC3 box, and it's more work than most people
are willing to do.

I also agree with Vasudevan on this. Definitely font rendering in linux 
based distribution is not as good as MS-Windows. Even small size fonts 
are very well displayed with more clarity in MS-Windows. This is not 
just about browser fonts, it applies to entire system fonts served by 
the font server. Even if I use ttf fonts used in MS-Windows in linux, 
they are not displayed as good as MS-Windows. Definitely linux based 
distributions need to improve a lot in this area.

Message-ID: <432E5F3F.6070006@ciosa.org.in>

Dear all,

Thanks for the overwhelming response.

A few things

1. Dates for the workshop is tentatively fixed on 8th or 9th of Oct. No 
of participants would be 30-40.
2. Mafoi Academy has come forward to give their place for the work shop.
3. There have been quite a few suggestions on content. Can you help us 
suggesting the content. For your understanding i am giving the 
background of our members

Our Members:

1.  CIOSA members are NGOs working for varied cause.
 2.  From both urban and rural.
 3. 80% of them are small and medium sized
 4. Not many are computer savvy. So it would require some pushing to 
make them participate.
 5. Have problem with english.

What we Intend to achieve:

1. How opensource can help them in communication, database management 
etc and other features which our members be beneficial.
2. Tamil search or interfaces.
3. Training courses as a followup.
4. Helping in implementation for the members interested.
5. Employment opportunity for them or for the beneficiary

So based on this can you pl suggest a few things.

The abv is a link to an article that discusses some of the problems
with OSS. Personally, I feel there is some truth when the author says:

"The open source community has so far tended to create facsimiles of
proprietary packages rather than the next killer application.  Linux
is an excellent example. Although it contains many powerful new tools
and utilities, Linux is in essence a facsimile of Unix, a proprietary
operating system first developed at Bell Telephone Laboratories in
1969. Ironically, the legendary robustness of Linux actually owes more
to the good design of Unix and its older relative, Multics, than it
does the OSS development process."

Will OSS be able to deliver an app that defines and creates its own
market - something like what Photoshop or Dreamweaver or Lotus Notes
did in their respective domains? Will OSS be able to deliver that tool
that will mark a paradigm shift in the way people use their computers?

It's all about "brainstorming for ideas". Few OSS hackers seem to be doing 
this. Once they get the "killer" idea (one which is not obvious for others), 
anyone can start working on that. A few such OSS projects include - python 
(based on lisp, but really an innovation, IMO), dashboard, ? ...

Many sw companies, have 'research' team within it. I believe OSS programmers 
can to do this research (or call it brainstorming for provocative ideas) 
themselves.

I learned this only by working for a commercial company. It would definitely 
help me in my open source work.

Btw, IMHO, Lotus Notes is a counter-intuitive product. Don't vote for it :-)

  what made me to think is about the issues related to OSS and
mainly,*Intellectual
Property.*It is true that if you are not seld-employed,then whatever you 
discover belongs to the private organization if at all you use their 
resources.Even the *Conceptual Integrity *also rings many issues in my mind.

i think that it is difficult because of the release cycle.People in the 
communities release every fortnight a new version.When there is such a rapid 
development how can people deliver some stable software appln??..
there are also other issues corresponding to this,
a) is there a common Package Management System available?
b) if somebody asks you help on using linux,which linux distribution will u 
choose among all available!
c) the appln which i develop today, can it be installed after 1 year in an 
linux distro?
 there should be some common methodology applied and i think that is 
explained in that article in *Conceptual Integrity *section.
 hope the discussion goes on....

"Intellectual Property" is a very biased term misused
by corporate for their selfish needs.

hi,
 but if u take industry it has been a practice that if someone talk about 
linux project,the next moment they ask, is it a university project or for 
study purpose?..
 there is yet a common methodology to come and i think that would help linux 
a much lot....i do agree linux s powerful and am also linux enthusiast,but 
that doesnt mean that i shouldnt comment on the pitfalls of linux(what other 
people call)....i had written them in my previous mail..
 even then,there are people who thrive to make a methodology and here is the 
link,
 http://componentizedlinux.org/index.php/Componentized_Linux_overview
 am planning for a distribution with the help of Componentized Technology.

The question here is: will OSS deliver an earthshaking app. 

My take:
OSS enthusiasts revel in solving programming challenges rather than
solving real world problems (I use the word 'real' to mean problems in
the application space). So they choose a programming task that already
solved a 'real' world problem (say Unix) and reimplement it in a more
elegant and bug free manner (linux). All the adrenaline one craves for
is generated by this deed itself. But the fact remains that it is only
a 'reimplementation' of a solution conceptualized by someone else.

more later.

This is a myth which keeps getting repeated again and again, and like
all myths, starts with a small kernel of truth. In this case, that kernel 
relates
to the Linux kernel, which was originally written to work in a manner
similar to the Unix kernel as described in various textbooks, including
books by Bach and Tanenbaum that were widely in use at that time.
It definitely is not a facsimile copy of Unix - there is no source code 
that is common between the Linux kernel and the Unix kernel.

OTOH, the GNU userland that is commonly used in conjunction with
the Linux kernel to form the GNU/Linux OS, was originally written to
be a replacement for the userland(s) that shipped with commercial
implementations of Unix. There should be no surprise that it broadly
implements the same functionality - because that is what it was written
to do. Again, there is no common source code between the GNU
utilities and the Unix utilities, so neither is the copy of the other.

The ideas that inspired Unix definitely had a root in the Multics
project, but the implementation did not. Likewise, the ideas that
inspired GNU/Linux had a root in Unix, but not the implementation.

If you want the file 'abc' to be displayed when a user types
my.url1.com then you specify 'abc' as the default file to be sent in
your web server config file.

If you want the browser to know only my.url1.com and not www.url1.com
but still get 'abc' from www.url1.com then you should make my.url1.com
a proxy client - a simple script that just posts the request to the
new server, gets back the html file and just pass it on to the
browser!

Hope this helps.

 Thats exactly the point - OSS solves a problem which has been solved
earlier. Is it capable of finding and solving problems on its own!

Not true at all - the term Intellectual Property is misleading, and attempts
to use a single term to describe a number of widely differing legal 
principles
with vastly different rules. They are:

1) Patent Law
2) Copyright Law
3) Trademarks
4) Trade Secrets
5) Law of Contracts

Whatever you discover doesn't belong to the organization that employs you -
that is governed by Patent Law and the Law of Contracts. In particular, your
ideas don't belong to your employer by default unless you assign them to
your employer.

Why should there be one? If you don't like any particular one, you are
free to stop using it or write your own.

It is *your responsibility* to ensure that your app. will work with distros 
and
other apps in the future. If you write it according certain general 
guidelines and
principles, it should work for the conceivable future with any distro.

In your my.url1.com web server configuration file(httpd.conf) , I guess you 
will be having the virtual host

------------
<VirtualHost XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX >
    ServerName my.url1.com
    Redirect permanent /  http://www.url1.com/abc/
    .....
</VirtualHost>
------------------
where  XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX is the ip address of the my.url1.com

If the problem had actually been solved earlier to perfection, there
would have been no need to reinvent the wheel. The very fact that
the wheel was reinvented shows that the earlier solution was incomplete
or imperfect. 

I definitely do *not* want to replace my copy of Linux-2.6.13 with Unix
System 7 or whatever - that is not a *solution* to my *problem*.

Finding and solving problems is entirely orthogonal to the OSS
methodology, but as a matter of practical fact, OSS addresses this
much better than closed development efforts. Take a look at the
Beowulf project (for Linux clustering) or the Xen project (for para-
virtualization) - there's no equivalent in the closed-source world.
There are numerous other examples, but these two came to mind
immediately.

Well, let's take it a step further then ... Microsoft has been trying to 
implement an OS -- which is a problem that has been solved earlier. I 
mean, just because a piece of software falls in a class which contains 
other programs written already (be it unix-like OSes or OSes in general), 
are you saying, any further work on it is useless ?

Linux was like unix only in it's interface to applications and users - the 
fact that it was a reimplementation implies that he redid the whole thing 
.. and lots of people think he did a better job at it than traditional 
unix. Linux now runs on far more platforms than unix does. Since 2.6, it's 
multitasking has been a lot-better as well. It supports a lot of devices 
and peripherals .. if all this doesn't seem like "Solving a new problem" 
to you, well ... !

And if you want to see Free Software that solves "new" problems, think of 
programs like jabberd (and please don't say IM is solved .. jabber allows 
linking to other non-jabber networks), bitlbee, emacs (i mean, emacs 
fanatics will tell you there is no problem, new or old, that emacs can't 
solve), BitTorrent, etc.

Hi saravanan,
How about using a single frame and changing the src attribute for that frame. You can redirect to a different page without changing the url in ur address bar. Let me know if this solved your purpose or if your query is something different.

Crap! 

There are lot of GNU/Linux software that run on
application space and solve your real-time problems.
Apache web server is one good example for performance.

This is true for the Linux kernel. Moreover it was
because Unix (AT&T) didn't come with a "freely"
distributable license to all, in those days.

A lot of FLOSS "application" projects are ported to
different platforms so end users have the freedom to
use them. When you develop "application" projects you
don't see if its done on Unix first, you use the idea,
libraries, and implement it.

and I guess all the little  innovations that make up emacs and vim end
up being  'cannibalised' by  other non-free software.   fetchmail, who

completion is definitely a cute innovation, IMO.

We can redirect the url using mod_rewrite, but this
'll change the url. 

I need to maintain the same url , but the page 'll be
from another url.

One Day One Command 
===================

time -- Measure the program resource usage

Summary:

The `time' command runs another program, then displays information
about the resources used by that program, collected by the system
while the program was running.

Info consist of (i) Elapsed real time between invocation and
termination, (ii) User CPU time and (iii) System CPU time.

Examples:

$ time ls -- Run the ls and show usage info.

$ time -p ls -- Same above. Output in portable format.

# time -o file ls -- Redirect the output to a file.

# time -a -o file ls -- Append the output to a file.

# time -v sleep 6 -- Show more detail info.

# time -f "\t%E real,\t%U user,\t%S sys" sleep 6 -- Show formatted 
                                                    output.

Note: By using custom output format, we can print (I) Time,
(II) Memory and (III) I/O Resource informations.

Read: man time

Message-ID: <20050919144735.35881.qmail@web50203.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

I have written scripts for generating the different
ARM assembly instructions (and their permutations and
combinations) as supported by the GNU cross-toolchain
2.95.3, and a partial lex/yacc implementation for ARM
assembly. I don't have time now to do further work.

If anyone is interested in using it to implement an
instruction set simulator, or create object files, or
use the design for other processors etc., you can
check it out from:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/arm.sim.1.5.tar.bz2
http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/arm.sim.1.5.tar.gz

... after all, its GPL!

If you are willing to work on it, and if you register
your proposal to any FLOSS project website:

http://savannah.gnu.org
http://freshmeat.net
http://sf.net

do let me know, so I can remove the above from my
domain.  

Your code in the CVS will be the current development
code.

A good place to start learning lex and yacc (or you
can use flex and bison) is:

http://ds9a.nl/lex-yacc/cvs/lex-yacc-howto.html

Its not *redirect*. Its *rewrite*.  mod_rewrite is nifty. You could do
something like this:

http://puggy.symonds.net/~suraj/ragas/priya

and to get this done, I have the following in my .htaccess:

RewriteRule ragas/(.*)$ karnatik_ragasearch.php?raga=$1 [L]

In effect, whatever follows ragas/(.*) gets sent to the underlying PHP
app. and thats *without* redirection.

Please read up more about mod_rewrite.

You can use apache mod_rewrite to do an internal redirect. eg: drupal uses 
it a lot.

One point which I feel is being missed is that it is the quality of
the implementations that sets apart applications, be it FOSS or
proprietary. Application ideas come out first, independent of whether
the implementation is free or otherwise. Like quoted previously, an OS
was an idea, picture filters was an idea, etc. For an OS, a have a
free alternative (Linux) and other non-free ones. Similarly, Gimp vs
PhotoShop. What I think gives FOSS its credibility is how well these
implementations are done. Be it mplayer for playing video, or tidy for
cleaning up HTML; what makes FOSS great is how complete these
implementations are. One can say with much confidence that it would be
a really tough task to find an app with more features for playing
video than mplayer, or with more features for optimizing HTML than
tidy. I would say that FOSS has succeeded in delivering such products
in many application areas.

it moves on...

Dear Friends,

Yesterday i received the consignment of free opencd from
softwarefreedomday.org(the official cd of software freedom
day.org).This consignment contains around 250 cds which has windows
open source appz and ubuntu live os(both in one cd i beleive). If this
 would have reached us in time, we would have distributed it in the
software freedom day on sept 10.I received this consignment with the
seal broken state,further i was informed by the softwarefreedomday.org
that they are sending 2 t shirts , ballons and tattoos, but this
contents are not there in the parcel. I dont know whether the
softwarefreedomday.org sent it  or is it  the handwork of our beloved
customs/postal workers of hijacking the t-shirts/baloons/tatoos.

I am distributing this cds, Firstly some 30 cds to schools who
registered for software freedom day, i will ask tamil nadu science and
technological centre to mail them to the school, and i have
requirement of nearly 50 cds to be distributed to  people who asked
for it. Rest of the  cds i will bring it  to the next ilugc meet at
iitm.

Sincerely,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if

-Francis Bacon

Within quotes are statements made by others. My response to them follow :-

"If the problem had actually been solved earlier to perfection, there
would have been no need to reinvent the wheel. The very fact that
the wheel was reinvented shows that the earlier solution was incomplete
or imperfect."

No problem can be solved to perfection. If linux 2.6.13 solves the os
problem perfectly we wont need 2.7 or 2.8! The point that am making is
that the wheel has been invented and OSS only polishes the wheel. The
question I do not know an answer for is: can OSS 'invent' the wheel?

"  I definitely do *not* want to replace my copy of Linux-2.6.13 with Unix
System 7 or whatever  - that is not a *solution* to my *problem*. "

Unix System 7 was intended to solve a problem of its times. If one can
travel back in time, say to late 70s, and offer to replace Unix with
linux-2.6.13 am sure there will be no takers. Who will need support
for WiFi  or, say, firefox in 1970?

"Take a look at the Beowulf project (for Linux clustering) or the Xen
project (for para-
virtualization) - there's no equivalent in the closed-source world."

Am not knowledgeable enough to comment on Beowulf. Nor Xen ... but is
not Xen solving a problem (albeit differently) that VMWare already
does?

"I mean, just because a piece of software falls in a class which contains
other programs written already (be it unix-like OSes or OSes in general),
are you saying, any further work on it is useless ?"

I never said that!

'cute' innovations are not the issue here.

Most responses highlight the incremental innovation being added by the
FOSS model of s/w dev. I do  not deny this at all. My question is
still unanswered: Can OSS give an application that is mutative... not
incremental.

RewriteRule test/(.*)$ index.html [L] , its working. 

but RewriteRule ^/(.*)$ test/$1 [L] , not working.

 I didn't get any error. I am not getting the
index.html page from test folder, instead I am getting
the index.html from DocRoot. 

What may be the problem?

Today, I found the tools to view the Linux partitions within windows.

For Ext3

For Reiserfs

Both are nice.

Just a backup of the individual partions you use will be enough.

To make the backup you need or have to know certain things.
1. An alternate linux installation/live cd.
2. If you dont have any of the above then you can prepare a ramdisk with the 
required filesystem modules and boot with the ramdisk as the root 
filesystem.
3. You have to know what all the partitions are required to be backed up. 
The entire filesystem tree can reside on a single partitions or on multiple 
partions(typically these other partitions are mounted on /usr, /var, 
/boot... ). 
4. Once you have figured out the partitions, just mount it somewhere and 
make a zipped tar image of the folder.
5. Take care to preserver the permission and attributes while backingup.
6. While restoring, you should check the fstab file and make the required 
changes.
7. Rest is left for you to research.

If the entire file system tree is on a single partition, it is very simple.

Did you read the doc? Did you check if:

* mod_rewrite is installed?
* Have you turned on Rewrite with the RewriteEngine On directive?
* Did you check to see if the RewriteBase is set correctly?

Hi,

You can change in 3 ways, if you are using apache

1) "Using a Perl script with Virtual Host" 

<VirtualHost 61.247.252.103>
ServerAdmin linuz@globalanalytics.com
ServerName www.global-analytics.com
DocumentRoot /www/htdocs/

ScriptAlias /mark/articles "/www2/CAS.pl"
</VirtualHost>

The ScriptAlias is the key part here. It redirects all
requests from /mark/articles to the CAS.pl perl
script.

And the perl script looked like this,

#!/usr/bin/perl


print "Location:
http://www.globalanalytics.com$ENV{'REQUEST_URI'}";

$ENV{'REQUEST_URI'} is the key part here.

---------------------------------------------------
2) Using the mod_rewrite module for Apache

I compiled mod_rewrite into Apache and applied this
configuration option to httpd.conf.

<VirtualHost 61.247.252.103>
ServerAdmin linuz@globalanalytics.com
ServerName www.global-analytics.com
DocumentRoot /www/htdocs/

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} 
^www\.global\-analytics\.com$
#RewriteRule ^(/articles)(.*)
http://www.globalanalytics.com/
</VirtualHost>

------------------------------------------------
3) Using Redirect with Virtual Host -- "Simple method"

<VirtualHost 61.247.252.103>
ServerAdmin linuz@globalanalytics.com
ServerName www.global-analytics.com
DocumentRoot /www/htdocs/

Redirect /gas/ http://www.globalanalytics.com/
</VirtualHost>

--------------------------------

One Day One Command 
===================

gcc -- GNU C Compiler

Summary:

Several versions of the compiler (C, C++, Objective-C, Ada, Fortran,
and Java) are integrated; this is why we use the name "GNU Compiler
Collection". GCC can compile programs written in any of these above
languages.

This C program is used in the examples.

#define DISPLAY "Hello World\n"
main()
{
 #ifdef MACRO
    printf(DISPLAY);
 #else
    printf("No Macro\n");
 #endif
}

Examples:

$ gcc hello.c -- Place output in a.out file.

$ ./a.out -- Run the binary file.

$ gcc -Wall hello.c -- Show all warning messages.

$ gcc -c hello.c -- Compile, Don't Link. Place output in hello.o

$ gcc -S hello.c -- Stop after the stage of compilation proper 
                    and save the ASM code in hello.s file.

$ gcc -DMACRO hello.c -- Predefine a Macro.

$ gcc -E hello.c -- Stop after the preprocessing stage and print 
                    output in stdout.

$ gcc hello.c -o hello -- Place output in hello file.

$ ./hello -- Run the binary file.

$ gcc -v hello.c -o hello -- Show the details of compilation stages.

$ gcc -I./myIncludes/ hello.c -- In myIncludes Dir also search for
                                 the Header files.

no! i certainly would say a marvellous tool and no! i am not a procastinate.

Building and installing from tarballs on an RPM-based distro is invariably
bad practice, and will definitely cause maintenance problems down the road.
Don't even dream of trying it on XFree86/Xorg - the downstream dependencies
are humongous.

Stick with the SRPMs. That way, if you have a bad build or need to downgrade

You don't get the point at all. Building from SRPMs and building from a 
source
tarball are both similar, in that they involve building from source. 
However, when
you build from SRPM, you obtain RPMs that can be 
installed/de-installed/upgraded/
down-graded/..., using the package manager (rpm), which tracks all upstream 
and
downstream dependencies. That's a *huge* advantage over building from a 
plain
source tarball. 

(Yes, I know that you can also perform rpmbuild from tarball, but that 
requires a
specfile and is not very different from building from SRPM).

i did build my xorg from bz2 tar ball and i dont have a single problem, may

Anybody can build an xorg or anything else for that matter from a tarball. 
But can you
de-install, upgrade or downgrade it cleanly, while ensuring that *all* 
dependencies are
satisfied?

posix is based on building from source. 


Huh? Posix is a collection of standards, not a package.

and srpms are also sources dude, dont you agree?? u can virtually control

Maybe you need to switch to Gentoo. Make sure you check out the Gentoo-Ricer

isnt gcc, "GNU Compiler Collection" i think it would be wrong if we say it 
as gnu c compiler. as its a collection of compilers. correct me if i am 
wrong. 
anyway i am using gcc 4.0 on the OpenBSD 3.7 machine 
$ /usr/local/bin/egcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: i386-unknown-openbsd3.7
Configured with:
/usr/ports/lang/gcc/4.0/w-gcc-4.0-20050226/gcc-4.0-20050226/configure
--verbose --program-transform-name=s,^,e, --disable-nls --disable-checking 
--with-system-zlib --enable-libmudflap --enable-languages=c,c++ --enable-cpp 
--with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local 
--sysconfdir=/etcThread model: single
gcc version 4.0.0 20050226 (prerelease)
$
gcc released another prereleased version, 4.0.1 which was rolled back due to 
loads of bugs. source irc://irc.oftc.com/#gcc they are trying to fix those 
major bugs. tho it will also be a prerelease and people are advised not to 
use it. unless they are very sure how to use it. 
http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.0/buildstat.html this lists out the various 
successful gcc build on various machines. but inspite of 1001 attempts i 
couldnt upgrade to gcc 4.0.1 on any of the machines. the compilation stopped 
in the middle with loads of errors in the source. now thats something, which 
you will have to get a live feedback from #gcc team in oftc. upon asking 
they said those are bugs, and they are trying to fix it. wondering when will 
the gcc 4.0.2 will be working on my machine. 
cheers!!
p.s. Mr. Bharathi, u know more than me, i am not pointing out flaws. i just 
said that because, what i said is mentioned in the gcc homepage. so no 
offense please!! :-)
p.s. 2 gcc man pages are here http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.0.1/gcc/
p.s.3 there is still a dns error as all my mails are getting bounced. 
damn... wth is wrong ??

dear chander, 
take a look here... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX... i dont disagree 
its all standards. but look for the catchy phrase .. let me point it out 
incase u have overlooked it.. " It is a near
acronym<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym>for
*Portable Operating System Interface*, with the *X* signifying the Unix 
heritage of the API <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API>. " 
so i guess where i stand is also right apart from u being right. 
" no offence taken none given. "
and gentoo?? hello i am using OpenBSD 3.7 and going to install OpenBSD 3.8 ( 
current ) on a p2 machine and will use it as a 
firewall/router/gateway/dns/dhcp/mail/proxy & etc etc including IPSEC and 
non-IRC shell server. soon!! my current systems are BSD (OpenBSD 3.7 (2 
machines)) and RHEL 4.0 clone ( CentOS 4.1). and i am getting one more pc 
where i will run openBGP and OpenNTPD. and i am migrating away from Linux. 
tho its a wonderful software. but its going haywire. it has put its steps 
into all possible boats. where as OpenBSD is standing on one policy.... " 
EAT, BREATHE, SLEEP, SHAVE, BATH, etc etc... anything that has to do with 
security.. and its painfully difficult to use since 1995 and no security 
hole in the OS since 1995... and there is no one to help other than 
man/faq/docs.. no one" plus for ur kind information pf is now implemented in 
linux kernel by netfilter. http://abstractvoid.se/pf4lin.html here is the 
link for more information incase u havent come across this. 
cheers!!
p.s. once again no offence taken, none given. thanks. 
p.s.2 can we have a more elaborate discussion on this topic..." pf4lin "

There is no such thing as "OSS" (Open Source Software), because Open
Source is only a marketing program for Free Software and one would not
expect them  to invent new things.  Free Software is the wheel here,
and we could give full marks to OSI for polishing the wheel well and
setting it rolling.

If we take Free Software, GNU operating system with HURD aims for an
os with no limits, which I think is original[1].

The most important innovation is that the freedom in the Free Software
environment makes Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Life
*theoretically* possible.  If a set of programs ever evolve to the
point of substantially improving themselves, Free Software environment
allows them regenerate giving birth to legitimate new versions,
whereas in a non-free software environment, the process will simply
abort. Machines could then think without getting emotional -
particularly about the fate of programmers who will then lose their
jobs and livelihood ;)

oops i forgot, incase u need help with xorg kindly go to freenode, #xorg and 
ask them how to compile from source for a hassle free. and they will also 
point out the techniques which can be implemented to avoid any problem. 
plus compiling something from source is a PITA when compared to rpm and deb 
pkgs. and you do have options to get back to old versions. i am not going to 
point them here, as u claim ur an experienced GNU/Linux user, find them out 
urself. 
no offence given, none taken. 
cheers!!
quote : " we asked for free software, that includes the silent " BUG FREE" 
which is avoided by most software vendors... reason; to man is to err :-)"
p.s. xorg 7.0 is coming out soon. and once again as an obstinate mule i will 
compile the package from sourcecode only... "SOURCE CODE".

You are right. Initially I decided to use GNU Compiler Collection in
that place. But I thought, It may confuse the newbie. So I used simple
term in that place and I added a extra info in the Summary section.

In G++ ODOC, I will add extra Info about GCC Project.

Thanks :)

I've built and installed gcc-4.0.1 from FC4 Updates, using gcc-3.4.4 from 
FC3
Updates. The built compiler is rock stable, and compiles the kernel, glibc, 
X, mozilla,
qt, gtk2, ... perfectly. However, I was unable to bootstrap gcc-4.0.1 using 
gcc-4.0.0
or gcc-4.0.1 itself (this may be a memory or ulimits issue - I only had 256 
MB RAM).

IMHO, gcc-4.0.1 has fewer bugs than gcc-4.0.0, but YMMV. In particular,
gcc-4.0.0 miscompiles X, but gcc-4.0.1 gives a functional libvgahw.a.

Hi folks,

          I think this mail is important too, so I'm forwarding it. I 
think it's about time we have a discussion and have a *formal* 
participation plan. What do you guys think? Atul Chitnis once wrote to 
me about this issue and in his own words: "ilugc is India's oldest LUG, 
and not having it participate in a national/international level event 
for the community is unthinkable."

         If there are any hold-outs, I would encourage every ILUGC 
member to sign up for the list and start contributing your ideas 
(relevant links at the end of the message).

Thanks,
Vamsee.

i am also talking about the gcc bootstrap issue. the installation wont 
proceed. unless u have fiddled with it. i did ask and paste the whole log of 
the installation to #gcc in irc://irc.oftc.org and they said thats a bug and 
they are examining the entire process. and its not just me many have 
reported the same problem. they looked at the make bootstrap code and said 
it in public in the #gcc channel ( this is the official gcc developers 
channel on irc) that its buggy and they are going to roll back. and not 
release any pre-release till all the bugs are fixed. 
even i am using gcc 4.0.0 on my openBSD 3.7 machine. 
$ /usr/local/bin/egcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: i386-unknown-openbsd3.7
Configured with:
/usr/ports/lang/gcc/4.0/w-gcc-4.0-20050226/gcc-4.0-20050226/configure
--verbose --program-transform-name=s,^,e, --disable-nls --disable-checking 
--with-system-zlib --enable-libmudflap --enable-languages=c,c++ --enable-cpp 
--with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local 
--sysconfdir=/etcThread model: single
gcc version 4.0.0 20050226 (prerelease)
$
i did try all methods to upgrade, right from source codes to tgz and 
needless to mention about ports and cvsup. but all the major mirrors seem to 
have rolled back this version due to the copious amount of bugs ( yet to be 
fixed ) if you are skeptical i can again make an attempt .... all 4 ( 
source.. bz2 to tgz... and from /usr/ports/ to cvsup) and post the 
voluminous amount of codes in http://pastebin.com and none of them seem to 
work. unless you are one of the gcc developers and have found out how to 
resolve this issue please let me be informed. 
gcc error which you faced is not due to ur low memory. i have compiled gcc 
4.0.0 on a p2 233 mhz, with just 128 mb of sdram ( is ur system slower than 
this ??) and that too using ports in openBSD 3.7 it took 5 hours to compile 
this whole thing. and finally a smile on my lips. 
now once again i am off for a very long time. say a couple of weeks. i will 
check my mails after a couple of weeks. so long GNU Users enjoy the power, 
gifted to us.

To answer your question more acurately you may need to give few more 
information, like what mailserver you use, what mail box storage does it 
support (maildir, mbox etc).

squirrelmail supports maildir format.
neomail, openwebmail supports mbox format.
You can also use horde-imp which is php based application and uses imap or 
pop protocol and independant of the mail box format.

I don't understand this.Is this an invitation to the LUG members or to 
ILUGC ?

I'm fine if this is an invitation to the individual members of ILUGC.I 
personally will be attending FOSS>in but as an individual and *not* 
representing ILUGC or my employer.But I don't understand why the ILUGC 
should be invited/involved ?

FOSS.in is *not* a community event and is not organised by Linux-India 
or any other community/public body.

It would be better if it reminds us of our own ancient philosophy that
devised the number place system and countless other innovations that
allow intelligence to express itself ;)

> evolution of softwares
> by themselves seems to be a gr8 idea,

The tools for doing that are already there. One could compile emacs
with emacs, gcc with gcc and probably others with far less
sophistication.  AFAIK, we are just one step away from letting
software evolve by itself:  we do not take sufficient care to define
functions more carefully and elaborately - once that is done, programs
would be able to see what we are after, and may be help us there.

> but think of it. it invites

That "protocol of some sort" has been around for a long time, and it
is known as Law.  How would a robot know it is not "proper" to hit
another person: If it has some idea about the Indian Penal Code, there
is a good chance it may reason that its master would become liable for
its acts, and may avoid hitting others.

> and not just give *birth* to newer versions, u'll hav a
> population explosion

Patches would be sent to the central repository as usual, where humans
or robots may evaluate the patch, and any "population explosion" could
be controlled.

Already, Free Software may be modified and redistributed, but we see
that when we talk of "emacs", by default it means a emacs version
released by FSF. Others like debian may have made modifications to
just suit its own environment or new branches like XEmacs may evolve.
But ultimately user preferences keep the population explosion in check
and control.

Ever read Sankaracarya's Daksinamurti Stotra that begins with about
"having understood that the world is within oneself even as a city
reflected in a mirror is, but projected as if it is outside, by maya,
as in dream"[1].  It was shocking when I realised what it really
meant.

We just have to check for truth as usual ;)  Already, some programs
allow us to "update" applications "automatically".  Would you not
check something for bugs or features before "updating" ?  It is nice
to have things done "automatically", but you still need to check with
your own senses before you start using anything new. If we ever *stop*
doing that, there is a grave danger thereafter.

> and even if *emotional* softwares comes into existence i bet it will be
> from the open source world and not from some lame M****$**t

Did you reason why?  Calling something lame without reason is unfair.

We could compile emacs with emacs or gcc with gcc because we have the
source, and further the GPL allows you to to do it - in fact you are
encouraged to do such naughty things and contribute patches ;)  You
cannot complile VC++ , or whatever non-free software,  because it does
not come with source code and further even if it does come, its
licence would prevent you from compiling new versions and
redistributing it.  We could say: Free software has life but non-free
software is sterile.

i (through bharathi) have received 4 names for possible list admins. what
work does being list admin involve? typically, 5-10 minutes a day with a
browser is all it takes. list admin needs to 'moderate' non-member posts
to the list and also occasionally clear the list of defunct members (those
who dont bother to sign off the list, but leave a dead email address
subscribed). we get maybe a half a dozen spam mails directed to the list
every day - these are held over for list admin to deal with. every so
often, a legit list member tries to post from a non-subscribed email
address and this too gets held over for list admin. we also get replies to
multi-list cross postings and these may be of interest to the list. list
admin gets email periodically when such posts are held over. list admin
just needs to login through the list admin web interface and make a few
strategic clicks to junk/approve the pending non-member posts (default is
junk). some actions cant be done from the web interface (will need shell 
access) and i will take care of these as and when i am alerted. so, being 
list admin is quite easy, no?

Wow. I'm certainly not aware of this. But rest assured, I'm in no way 
related to Linux Bangalore/BLUG or whatever they call themselves, I'm 
just an enthusiastic participant. And yes, I certainly want it to be a 
success, since it's not everyday that we get to attend such events in 
India. Sorry, but I'm not interested in their internal politics, and I 
cannot speak for them.

Probably both. They certainly encourage LUGs from different parts of the 
country to attend, and even have 'Community Tracks' wherein different 
LUGs can participate and talk about community-building, etc.

Mea culpa, I don't know enough to comment upon this. I guess, at the end 
of the day, it's up to the members whether they want to attend or not. 
I'm just an enthusiastic supporter.

I guess Benjamin did'nt want that appearing on the list and sent you a

Anyway now that it's on the list,it's worth a read for the ILUGC members.

Firstly, FOSS.in (Nov 29-Dec 2) is on week days. Even
if an employee takes a day off, colleagues will start
speculating ... did he/she go for an interview? Will
he/she be moving out? Hmmm.

Not sure how many companies will give employees four
week days off. Is my Division Head listening? :) 

Employees don't like to go on loss-of-pay either.

I don't know about Bangalore LUGS, never participated
in them, or attended any of their meetings, so can't
comment on anything. I just know they have a big
event, once a year.

Every FLOSS event should be an invitation. People
should have the freedom to attend or not attend,
participate or not participate. Whether you attend as
one among the public, or representing your company, or
representing your school/college, it really shouldn't
matter. We are all part of the _one_ big FLOSS
community!

I do agree that the FSS movement did shake the earth about how s/w is
developed. But this is not my question. Perhaps I was not clear when I
asked if OSS will invent the wheel. I did not mean OSS as a s/w
development model. I meant it as a business model. Let me rephrase my
question:

A software company does not patent any of its innovations (cute ones
included) and releases all its code to the general community. If the
innovation is of value there will be dozens of other companies that
seek to provide support for the same s/w undercutting prices to a
level that throws the original company out of business (if it is not
properly managed). After a period the market will only have highly
efficient players who can account for the productivity of every penny.

Now, the question is: Can these super efficient players afford sinking
money in research projects that might (just might) give them the next
killer app. Since developing a killer app is unpredictable, can these
companies stay in business till their research team comes out with the
'killer'? Can these companies do a Bell and employ the likes of Ken
Thompson, Dennis Ritchi, Kernighan, Pike etc and not care for 5 years
or so about what value they have added to their revenues? Would not
the other efficient players wipe such a company out of the market in a
year? How will the free thinking of great minds be funded? And even if
such a company gives out such a product will it have sufficient time
to recoup investments before the others catch up (the others can be
super efficient because they did not spend a penny on research and
have got the source code for free)?

HURD follows the microkernel approach but for all its advantages it is

Software is complex. It is not easy for every Jack and
Jill to understand code. You will have millions and
millions of lines of inter-dependant code.

When you have software code, software professionals
build on the code, or use only a module of the entire
release code and develop more projects on them.

Yes. Value is given to real products. Companies who do
workarounds in their products and try to sell things
without bug fixes cannot survive. The customer gets a
proper product for the money he spends on it, compared
to proprietary closed-source models, where you pay for
stuff which you are not sure if it really does what it
is supposed to do. A name rings a bell in my mind!

Dude, there are lot of companies in India who already
do R&D using GNU/Linux in embedded systems/VLSI. Check
my database collection:

R&D can also be for a year or two. 

Yes, we make money out of it.

> Would not

Nope. 

ARM have their headquarters in UK. Russell King works
for Deep Blue Solutions and works on ARM Linux
development. CodeSourcery Inc have done the compiler
toolchain build using GNU for ARM. Don't tell me they
are out of the market. ARM rules the embedded world.

> How will the free thinking of great minds be
> funded? 

Software is not a manufacturing industry. Because of
its nature, it falls into a service industry, where,
companies earn income through maintenance and tech
support.

Are you a business person? or a technical guy? If you
don't mind, can you tell in which domain you work on?

> HURD follows the microkernel approach but for all

In the industry, yes. In the academia, no.

L4ka::pistachio microkernel was developed in
University of Karlsruhe, Germany.  Hurd is being
ported to it:

http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd-l4.html

http://www.l4ka.org/projects/pistachio/

Work is going on.

Thankfully, I'm sure my boss won't object... I normally make sure to put 
this on my appraisal form under "training needed" - normally it's the 
only thing I have there. In the next appraisal, I put it under 
"professional development/conferences attended". Double brownie points ;)

I would ask you to give it a try, but don't take my word for it - 
participate in the list, check out the speaker list when it comes out 
and see if it convinces you. Last year, I went there for one thing only 
- to hear Wietse Venema speak (Postfix, Coroner's Toolkit, etc). 
Thankfully, I met a lot of other cool people too. In 2003, Nat Friedman 
& Miguel de Icaza generated a lot of buzz for their Mono project. There 
are normally multiple tracks running in parallel, so you don't have to 
sit through the stuff that you're not interested in (there is a downside 
to this - you sometimes have a hard time deciding which talk to attend).

You are implying that a company can take advantage of the fact that
its code cannot be comprehended by others! Stretching it a little
further can we also obfuscate the code? I think it is not too far from
closed source!

What if there is a really smart bunch of professionals (eg.
ex-employees) who lift the whole code lock stock and barrel and only
provide support? If it is OSS this is absolutely legal.

Is it OK for a company that fixes all bugs and sells a quality product
to be closed source?

How will giving jack and jill (customers) source code make a
difference. They anyway will not know if it really does what it says
it does?

> A name rings a bell in my mind!

FOSS movement is being hijacked by anti-microsoftism! There are other
companies too - IBM, HP, CA, Intel for instance paying Linus Torvalds
and others out of money they earn out of their closed source products!

 But are they making enough money to indulge the master programmers
who will make them a 'wheel'? Can they employ Rob Pike or Vint Cerf
for that matter? It is mostly undercutting, incremental innovations
and providing support for existing concepts.

But can ARM deliver like Bell did with a multiuser time sharing system
in a batch processing world (and a failed Multics to scare them)?

Software needs free thinking great minds as much as a manufacturing
industry. And these minds have desires and desires cost money.

This is the whole point of "Free Software". Jack and Jill's right to get 
the source code for the software they buy. Its not about giving away 
software for free, nor is it about bringing down microsoft, or the 
philosophical intricacies of reinventing/polishing/'making a square' 
wheel. Open Source is about the collaborative benefits of freely available 
source, Free Software is about the fact that when I buy software from you, 
I WANT and have a right to the source code.

I've added custom patches to dozens of programs currently running on my 
system - right from scilab to gaim to aterm to my window manager, and I 
don't know how I'd get any work done without them.  It doesn't matter 
whether I'm in an overwhelming minority, I still have a right to this 
freedom. It's not about whether it makes sense for the company to do so 
.. it's a consumer right ! The Free Software movement, unlike the Open 
source one, is about what's best for the user, not what's the best 
development / money minting model. So, while Open Source supports may be 
amenable to "special exceptions" to the give the source with the software 
rule, we're not !

People will always be around to give reasons why such a freedom will spell 
doom for the industry. I mean, you can always find reasons why x will 
spell doom for y, for every ordered pair (x,y). That's not the point. The 
point is, if enough *users* are educated about the benefits of having the 
source code of the software, and then go ahead and demand it from 
software vendors, I'm sure every company will be forced to find a way to 
foster innovation AND give the user the source.

Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with 
step-by-step instructions for building your own GNU/Linux OS 
from source code. URL: http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/

One Day One Command 
===================

ltrace -- Library call TRACEr

Summary:

ltrace is a program that simply runs the specified command until it
exits and intercepts & records the library/system calls, which are
called by the executed process, and the signals, which are received by
that process. It can used study the internal flow of a program.

Examples:

$ ltrace sleep 1 -- Trace all Lib call of 'sleep' command.

$ ltrace ls -- Trace all Lib call of 'ls' command.

$ ltrace -d sleep 1 -- Print more detailed info.

$ ltrace -i sleep 1 -- Print the value of the Instruction Pointer at 
                       every lib call.

$ ltrace -S sleep 1 -- Show System Call trace also.

$ ltrace -S -L sleep 1 -- Show only System calls.

$ ltrace -r sleep 1 -- Print a relative time-stamp with each line of
                       the trace.

$ ltrace -t sleep 1 -- Prefix each line of the trace with the time of
                       day.

$ ltrace -o file sleep 1 -- Redirect the output to a file.

$ sleep 60 & -- Dummy background Job.

$ ltrace -p 1234 -- Attach to the process with the PID 1234 (use dummy 
                    job's Pid) and trace.

$ ltrace -n 3 sleep 1 -- Indent each new nested call by 3 Spaces.

Incorrect. Wrong assumption. Linux kernel is millions
of lines of code. There are so many companies who work
on it.

How can you be so sure, when you can't see the source

Companies don't venture into domains that they don't
know about. It would be a risk for them. Do companies
in the banking industry do R&D work on
micro-controllers? No.

You seem to question the credibility of ARM, which has
been quoted as an example. Have you ever opened up
your mobile phones, or PDAs, or digital cameras or
camcorders? You will find ARM SoCs.

You don't need to have big names to do some invention.
There can even be truly good programmers from
universities who can do innovative stuff.

You are talking about operating systems and concepts.
ARM are in the embedded systems/VLSI.

> Bridge between business and technology.

Your views are based on a business perspective which
really lack any technical backing.

Hi,

Very cunning. Malicious. Pathetic. What kind of person
are you? This kind of attitude is not ethical and not
productive. A business manager? 

Good hackers/programmers don't think like this. They
think in terms of how effectivly they can solve
problems, how best they can provide optimal solutions
to challenging problems.

> Bridge between business and technology.

You are not willing to identify your work, or domain,
or what you do, but, you simply want to comment.

I don't want to waste my time or ilugc's bandwidth in
trying to teach you about software development or
concepts of compilation or programming or technology.
Period.

Lest I sound like a hypocrite let me clarify that am benefitting a lot
by open source products like linux. And I also truly beleive that the
open source movement (FSF, OSF etc) has shaken the software giants and
given hapless consumers an alternative. The questions that am raising
are those that trouble me for lack of an answer.

If we accept that access to source code is a fundamental freedom then
the questions I raise are irrelevant. But what makes this a
fundamental right? One doesnt ask for Coke's formula when one buys
Coke. Or ask for the design blueprints when one buys a car! So why
does access to source code of a product you buy become a fundamental
right?

It is a fundamental right because it has controlling function like
government. Do not treat software like product, think it like
government. Its role is seen in our life, not just as system
personnel, as end user also. e.g. from bank-to-diagnosis-to-electing
prime ministers. Software interfers in our personal life. Have you
ever seen a car taking you to automatically to a red-light area
without your consent, but a software browser takes me to a such sites
without consent. Well that is the power of software - it has
controlling and governing function. That is why software requires
some public control.

Coming to your coke analogy, do you know that all food items are
governed by PFA-Prevention of Food Adulration act, which empowers
government agencies to check the content and take leagal action in
case it is not fit for human consumption.  Can government do this say
for example examining a closed source software which takes you to
illegal site? Does any such agency exists? As long as there is no
other public auditing mechanism like PFA established  the only viable
option left is access to source code to ensure our personal freedom.

Do not look software purely as science/technlogy/business. It has
social and personal angle also.

This is just to provoke thoughtful emotion.

Raman.P

Despite the subject, Shakthi has become emotional! In that state of
mind it is difficult to argue cogently. Already he has drilled his
feet with a heavy machine gun! It is best he does not waste his time
on this discussion. That said, am really, really curious how the
domain I work in or my position will in any way affect the truth (am
not saying my point is the truth.... just that domains and
designations are irrelevant here).

For his own sake I advice that he tries to understand that logic is
not the exclusive preserve of programming or computer science and that
a person who applies logic to problems beyond plain programming is NOT
'pathetic', malicious and cunning. He also insinuates that 'good
hackers and programmers' do not extend logical reasoning to anything
outside programming! Daft suggestion.

If any of you think this discussion is getting on your nerves, pls
send a mail to the list admin. If the admin thinks there is enough bad
blood being created in this thread to stall it he can (privately or
publicly) tell me to STFU.

Tmorw, if we stop drinking this color water, it is loss to the color
water Company. But consumer will not get affected in any way.

With-out Blueprint, We can repair our car at road side mechanic shop.
Bcoz only the blueprint is closed, But engine is open(NOT Sealed). I 
can do reverse engg to find what is going on.

In Closed Source softwares, the Blueprint (Algorithm) and the Engine
(Code) both are closed.

The consumer, if anything, gains by avoiding coloured water, which is
the source of many ailments, obesity...

In fact, we heard that some were even contaminated with
insecticides...

It is because Most business and MNCs treat us like insects/worms,
like tamil saying "Puzhuvail pola madhikiranga".

I was told many drugs/medicines banned in Western Countries for
causing harm to human beings are freely sold by MNCs here without
restraint.

It is absolutel true and you know better abt the drugs which have been
banned in other so called advanced countries but available here. We
will not be able to know which one is banned and which is not.

The same applies for colored drinks also. The test report by Ms.Sunita
clearly states that there are pesticides in Indian Drinks which were
not found in the American drinks.

But atleast we can stop taking these color water as this is definitely
and slowly killing us just like cigarettes. But most of the youngsters
also unfortunately arguing that there is nothing wrong in taking these
as they feel it signifies the style.

Hope our people take a note of this and stop taking these colored drinks.

Regards

Ravi Kumar Tenneti

It isn't a fundamental right - the company can refuse to disclose the
source code, and I will refuse to buy/use it, just like I refuse to buy Coke
(for different reasons, unrelated to the formula being proprietary).

Likewise, a company can weld the engine compartment shut, and
refuse to disclose anything about the internals of a car, but there
would be very few buyers for that kind of car - I certainly wouldn't
buy such a car.

OTOH, it can supply
a full 1000-page shop/repair manual on a CDROM for a nominal
price, like Mercedes-Benz does for all its cars in the US, and find
repeat buyers flocking back for over a 100 years. It's entirely their
choice whether to keep it closed or open, and it's entirely the
choice of the consumer whether to buy it or not. The history of
engineering/technology shows that customers prefer open products/
standards/technology, and the most successful manufacturers
have adapted to that customer preference.

Over time, the same trend will become apparent in computing as well,
and closed products will fall by the wayside. It's already happened to

There was a gentleman, Mr.Subramanya Sastry from Sarai (http://sarai.net)
who had a talk about Newsrack, a toll to index and archive RSS feeds.

Hi Aswin,

After your initial mail, I wrote a Python script to scrape the Hindu's
front page and convert it to RSS 2.0. I wanted to put it on some site,
but decided to check with the folks at the Hindu about the legality of
re-purposing their content for syndication. I haven't  received a
reply till date. Anyway I am attaching the script I wrote - it's a
quick hack, but you should be able to modify it easily, if you know a
bit of Python, and use it to scrape any other site.  It uses
BeautifulSoup and ScrapeNFeed, which you find here:
http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
http://www.crummy.com/software/ScrapeNFeed/

Congrats to "The Mount Road MahaVishnu" for belatedly moving in the
right direction.

You just need to research it a little, using Google. And just FYI, there
are a lot of things which are not banned (tobacco, distilled spirits, guns)
in the West, which can be harmful; and likewise, a fair number of things
that have been banned over the years in various countries which are not
necessarily harmful (typewriters, copying machines in the erstwhile USSR).

The same applies for colored drinks also. The test report by Ms.Sunita

Yes, obviously - and the same applies to *any* source of ground water
in India, including tap water and milk in India.

Why? Because a lot of groundwater in India is pesticide-contaminated,
whereas the same is not the case in the US. A cow grazing on lands
with pesticide-contaminated groundwater will also produce pesticide-
contaminated milk.

And why is the groundwater so contaminated in India? You can thank the
Green Revolution, and its critical dependence on pesticides, fertilizers
and borewell water for producing sugarcane and other resource-intensive
export crops for that. The run-off from the fields, after they've been
sprayed with pesticides, soaks into the ground and contaminates the
groundwater. Before the Green Revolution, the crops were lower-yielding
varieties, which however did not need pesticides and fertilizers to the
same extent.

But atleast we can stop taking these color water as this is definitely

I guess they'll also have to stop drinking all ground water as well. Don't
forget milk either.

But you'd do better to campaign for stopping the cultivation of
water-intensive
export-oriented cash crops like Sugarcane. It will also have the beneficial
side-effect of reducing the dependence of Indian agriculture on rapidly
depleting fossil fuels (Natural gas -> Methane -> Ammonia -> Urea ->
Fertilizers).
A 6% drop in production of natural gas at Bombay High last month resulted
in a 50% drop in production of Ammonia in India. Think that over carefully,
especially its implications for the possible cause of the next famine in
India.

-Siva

P.S. It helps to avoid drinking carbonated drinks like Coke as well, but for
reasons unrelated to pesticide contamination.

Very true. Though it does not absolve Coke of its failure it is a
matter of concern. The water supplied by many muncipalities in India
are way beyond WHO drinking water standards.

OPML (opml.org) can be used as well to consolidate all rss feeds in
one application. Habari xenu, mozilla firefox extension supports opml.
It is useful to consolidate all rss feeds and view them under single
window.

In addition, at "THE HINDU" website, they are yet to include the RSS
link in their HTML meta tag. If it's included, the square button would
be displayed in the right bottom corner in firefox. It makes
subscriber's job easy to locate RSS link. Hope, they would include it
at the earliest.

Hi,

Its usually a good practice to ask about ISPs in the
mailing list because you'll find people from different
areas using different ISPs. You will find lot of such
posts in the mailing list archives.

Apparently, it isn't nicotine that poses danger. But rather,
traces of other toxic ingredients like tar, Hydrogen Sulphide,
Carbon Monoxide, Ammonia, Formaldehyde, Acetone, Lead and so on
in the cigarette smoke that causes harm to the lungs in the
long run.

OTOH, traces of all the above mentioned elements and compounds
are found almost everywhere within the city (in the air that
we breathe, in food that we eat, and in water that we drink).

So, cannot comment if cigarette smoking is anymore dangerous
than waiting for a bus at Mount Road bus stand :-)

Hello Mr.Siva,

I think we came back to the debate of US based companies and thier style of
operations outside their country.

Yes I do agree that our ground water table is contaminated but who asked the
so called big cola comapnies not to install water purification plants. They
donot want to do that as it will reduce their profits. So, they will do what
they like as Indians anyway take this without any issues. Even if a issue is
raised in the Parliament also it can be silenced as they have lot of money
power.

Please go thro' the mad cow disease and why it has started also then you
will understand how thirsty those so called American and British companies
are ...

And these people talk abt Ozone layer protection and other stuff. We cannot
stop Sugar cane production and other things due to various reasons but if
they stop using Coke Tins (which are harming the Ozone Layer) the World will
be much better place to live in. You are saying something which is a need
based thing here in India vs Style (as these so called aerated drinks are
nothing but for Style).

To top it all, they are slowly making us to eat the junk food which will
increase the obesity (Pizzas etc.,) you might be aware that obesity is the
second most critical problem that US is facing now. Courtesy Junk foods.

Fortunately/ unfortunately (depends on how you are viewing it) I was not in
US like you but because of that I am able to view from a different angle
which I feel most of NRIs will not be able to do.

Please excuse me for using this forum to express my views which are not at

O, thanks!.. I was wondering how firefox did this for a few sites. You
could write to the editor@hindu. Some days back, I wrote a mail asking
for rss feeds. I did not get a reply, but got the feeds instead :)
But anyway, hindu's website is not upto the mark in many respects.

And Ram ,
 Thanks, I will tinker with the script.
I too did not some searching as far as legalities were concerned.. but
i could not find any specific reference . The link that I had posted
in my first mail (http://xml.newsisfree.com/feeds/64/2664.xml  is one
such publicly available unofficial feed. That site has loads of such
stuff..so i assume it is ok.

Just an aside ...Do rss feeds have a huge following in India??
Bloggers use it a lot.. but outside the blogosphere, not many seem to
be interested. Even some of my frds with a broadband connection are not
great fans of reading newspapers online, on a daily basis. I remember a
Hindu article by J. Murali on this subject.. but he did not have many
nos to show from the indian side.  I mean it terms of no. times the
xml pages are requested everyday etc.  He just had some nos for NYT
etc. (and they were VERY impressive..running into millions,if i remember right)

I'm one of the earliest posters on Usenet pointing out the link between
regenerative
amplification of prions and the practice of feeding rendered cattle meat to
cattle. Do a
Google search - BTW, Gadjusek figured this out in 1964. There is also a
hypotheses
that the initial trigger for the epidemic came from the export of rendered
cattle parts
from India.

Sugarcane cultivation is not need-based - the primary reason that the
acreage under
Sugarcane cultivation was expanded from 1960 onwards is that it was seen as
an easy
way to obtain export earnings from the sale of refined sugar to the same MNC
cola
companies (Coke, Pepsi) that you're so busy deriding now.

Guess what? - there is no free lunch. The 'virtual water' content in sugar
is enormous -
to manufacture 1 kg of refined sugar requires about 1000 times the quantity
of water
to grow the sugarcane and refining the sugar removes all this water and
dumps it into
the ground as polluted waste molasses, heavily contaminated by pesticide.

The net result of growing sugarcane in AP, TN and Maharashtra is that most
of those
areas which had a water table at zero metres (i.e. at the surface) in 1960,
now have a water
table at -100 metres, i.e. desertification has set in vast areas of these
states. The only
way to continue growing sugarcane in these places is through the use of free
electricity
to operate borewells, and through the use of large dams like the Sardar
Sarovar and
the like.

The only silver lining to this is that the Cola MNCs found an even cheaper
alternative
to Indian sugar in the 80s - High-Fructose Corn Syrup, from corn grown
locally in the
US. The market for refined sugar collapsed soon after, and exports from
India to the US
became uneconomic, thus destroying the Greed-Revolution in Sugarcane in AP,
TN
and Maharashtra.

If there's any moral in this story, it is this: You should fall on your
knees and thank
the MNC Cola companies for finding an alternative to sugar. Without it, most
of
the agricultural belt in Southern India would look even worse than it is now
- a desert.

Anyway, Sugarcane cultivation has already started collapsing on its own in
the last
decade as the freebies (free electricity and water) dried up. India has also
turned into a
net importer of sugar (mainly from Australia) in the process. IMHO, that's
perfect,
because every kg of sugar imported is equivalent to saving over 1000 litres
of fresh
water.

Software products are released for millions of purposes. Maybe there
is a case for compulsorily open sourcing those that have a bearing on
the public good. But this arguement is not valid to insist that all
s/w be open sourced.

 I do not think the PFA will have Coke's formula with them. Coke
actually left India in the 70s because our government insisted that
the formula be revealed. AFAIK their stand is still the same - only
the govt wilted.

It is not the govts business - at least not directly. If your browser
takes you to an illegal site use another browser. Market forces will
eleminate faulty browsers.

Likewise in s/w too. If you are not happy with a s/w dont use it. It
is the s/w company that is affected. The consumer can use a different
company's product.

My analogy is different. The algorithm is the concept/idea that is
still abstract. It is the source code which is the 'blueprint' -
giving a tangible form to the algorithm. The compiled binary is the
'product' which does what it claims to do.

Physical product companies do not make that big a noise about reverse
engineering because the infrastructure cost of replicating the product
is itself a barrier to competition. Where the barrier is not strong
enough product patents come in. Example, a Ferrari model is not
patented but the suspension subsystem might be patented. So, if
patents are OK in other fields (where there are other barriers to
copying) why is it a bad idea in s/w (where the barrier to copying is
weak - by copying I mean rewriting the code... not pirating)?

If the source code of a s/w is to be given out and also there are to
be no s/w patents, how will a software company ensure that the product
it has just released in the market will earn them enough money to pay
for more research, give the programmers a pay hike (the biggest cost
for a s/w company) and offer better returns to its investors? Will not
another company lift the code make fancy modifications to it (just
enough to fool the courts) and sell it at a much lesser price?

Of course, it can be argued that it benefits the end user by being
less expensive! But then, the govt giving free food, free clothes and
free cash also benefits end users. But does it benefit society?

Yes, and in an ideal society people should be "not happy" with 
closed-source software.

No ! You still have access to the building blocks of your car, which is 
what the source code is like. No one's asking the programmer to write an 
essay on HOW he came up with the idea for the program. The fact that you 
can open up your car and see its engine and what all it's wired to, is the 
equivalent of having source code. If one day your car stops working, you 
don't have to find an authorized dealer to repair it, anyone else can. 
See, the car company is giving up a huge opportunity to make money here.. 
they could've welded the bonnet shut, and forced you to come to them 
everytime the car broke down ... hmm, i wonder how mechanical engineers 
feed their kids.

The car comes with source, .. you can take it apart, replace components - 
many of us don't do it, but some people do. What is more, because its 
"open" i have the option of going to third parties for repair, etc. I 
would not buy any other kind of car.

Because those patents are for tangible designs, not mathematical methods. 
Look at an average software patent and a non-software one.

So, RMS and the FSF guys are on the dole, eh ? Beg on street corners, is 
it ? Oh wait, I forgot .. they doesn't make innovative software, only 
banal stuff like emacs and gcc. Nice point !

No, its not about free food. If I pay for software, I get to own it, 
source code and all ! Pretty simple, if you think about it. I don't want 
to be held ransom to one company if i choose to deploy that software and 
then later find that I need to make an epsilon change to it.

what do you suggest? some regulating agency list out 'areas' which it
deems to be for public good and then ensure that there are no patents
or closed source stuff in them? do you seriously think such a thing is
feasible? firstly, i could visualise most of the software on my debian
box to be used by millions of the public, but there are closed source
equivalents existing for them. for that matter, i hope you include the
os in this category of software for public good. secondly, software
are complex creatures and companies can use this to their advantage to
escape the list of areas. what if the company calls an equivalent of
emacs a `psycho-analysis software with a variety of add-ons' because
it has the `doctor' package. seems far-fetched but just an example for
the argument....

what if the other browser, or for that matter, all browser companies
decide to do this? seems too unprobable? this is what M$ has been
trying to do all these years. either make opponents agree to their
principles, or buy them out...this idea of using competition to ward
off all evils isn't a good solution, as it assumes the competitors do
not have cooperation amongst themselves.

there are ppl who argue that money can be made out of free software. i
think such an argument is hardly necessary. closed source is
*anti-social*. period. it is a non-issue if it causes loss to
companies and programmers who thrive by it. there are many anti-social

Mr. RMS, you are the greatest failure I've ever seen. Even after a
decade of crying coarse, people don't seem to realise that fsf exists
not to make things inexpensive, but to give users much needed power.

it moves on...

I suppose you have booted of the Xen0 kernel.
Have you started xend before trying to get another domain up ?

The error clearly says "cannot connect to xend..".

Read the manual/docs.

A 'blueprint' clearly denotes (or rather documents) the idea/design
of a product. In that sense, a documented algorithm could be considered
as the blueprint of the program. The source-code and binary are
mere implementation mechanism.

Of course, by following the tunes of Software Freedom/Open Source, you
cannot become the world's richest man in a decade and/or own the world's
most dominant/powerful software company. But... you can definitely
run a company thats profitable, make enough money to pay for more
research and keep your investors happy too. For example, look up
Red Hat Inc., MySQL AB., SleepyCat Software Inc., Sendmail Inc., ...
- the list can go on.

You can either run a company merely for the sake of "making money"
to become rich and famous or for the sake of improving the
standards of life in general (or both). When you support/promote
  Software Freedom/Open Source as the key component of your business
practices, you are clearly trying to portray yourself as an ethical
business entity and also aid in contributing for the betterment
of "free" and "open" society in general. You can definitely make
money either by services/support or even get funded by larger
organizations/government to continue research and development of your
product while remaining a true believer in Free Software/Open Source.

Selling closed source software is as good as selling a car with its
bonnet sealed. Heck, I wouldn't even buy a sealed watch... why even
bother purchasing/trusting a sealed car or closed source software ?!

> Will not another company lift the code make fancy modificationsto it  
> (just enough to fool the courts) and sell it at a much lesserprice?

That could happen in a closed source environment using reverse
engineering techniques. If a company lifts a GPL'ed code for instance
and makes any modifications to it, it is duty-bound to release the
modified source to the public as well which in turn helps the original
author/company to incorporate those changes into their original software
project/product if those changes are useful. Such being the case, now
tell me who wins and who loses ? ;-)

Of course, with a more flexibile license like the BSD license, it is
possible that a company creating a closed source project could lift
the code and merely give a 2 line credit (which to my knowledge, almost
all major closed source OSes do) without having to disclose the modified
source. It all depends on the original author/company on how much of
ownership they want on their code and how aggressive they want to be with
regards to modification/redistribution of their code.

Regarding the cost factor - to my knowledge, most open source products
dont sell at a "fancy" cost. What is mostly sold are service and support
and the cost of service/support is directly dependent on the company's
reputation, their infrastructure/facilities and their expertise/experience.
Just because there are several hundred (or thousand ?) linux distributions
based on Red Hat Linux for the enterprise segment, it doesn't mean that
Red Hat is losing money - do they ? :-)

It is clearly *not* "free lunch" that we are talking about.
Free Software/Open Source is about "freedom" to use the software
the way we like and to modify/contribute/redistribute them to our
satisfaction.

Information/Technology must remain free (as in freedom) for us to
evolve to better standards of life.

" Nobody is forcing you to eat junk food. If you don't want it, you don't
have to buy and eat it."

That is what precisely our people are doing and those MNCs are paying the
film stars and Cricketers to sell this more.

Finally there will be difference of opinions and it is good also. I am from
AP and I know why farmers do depend on the culivation of Sugar Cane and here
in TN also the situation is no different.

There will be people who think that MNCs are doing good and there will be
people who think MNCs are destroying certain things. So the debate goes
on... but we need to put a stop for this discussion as this is supposed to
be on Linux rather than on Colas.

There are two reasons that got me concerned - the legalistic line at
the bottom of their web page and the fact that you can put ads in RSS
feeds these days - for example, using Google Ads. While they may not
have realised the importance of syndicating their content till
recently, I think they might get very protective about their content,
once they discover what's possible with RSS.

Very interesting. Just a tangential thought - While you are in the
middle of one of these so called revolutions (green, white, etc) there
is a religious fervour all around and it is very diffcult to have a
rational discussion.  Imagine trying to criticize M.S.Swaminathan or
C.Subamaniam even today ! The actual impact becomes clear only down
the road. Right now we are in the middle of another one of these
hyped-up phases - IT revolution or whatever, that is also massively
subsidized and is the beneficiary of enormous tax breaks that other
industries don't enjoy.  The impact of this could be lot less physical
some ways compared with the Sugarcane industry, but be a lot more
profound in terms of social impact  and a lot less intractable.

Even (Free | Non-Free) Software is controlled by MNCs and so caution
is advisable while dealing with them / their goods / services /
software / products / practices / etc.

Does any independent Indian institution conduct code audits of
Software and certify them as safe for use ?  Free Software alone may
qualify such scrutiny and certification may also compel others to
migrate towards healthier practices.

Maybe it's time for a ilugc-non-tech mailing list.
Just having a yahoogroup mailing list for that should suffice.

It'll also improve the SNR on ilugc.

We need a place to discuss non tech issues, at ilugc where some hundreds of
professionals meet and discuss about tech issues.There are some people like
me who like to discuss both technical queries and non technical issues and
in between to crack a joke.If ilugc is only confined to technical issues,
then we need a place to share our non tech issues. As Mr.Toufeeqh rightly
suggest a yahoo group may be place to facilitate our purpose.

I feel the role of ilugc is not just discussing technical issues alone but
also to bring a social change of inculcating foss (like linux) to the
general public. In social mood people tend to discuss variety of subject and
if it is going to be bounded by some rules & regulations in the camp where
we talk about freedom, i would classify that this is the highest degree of
irony to freedom.At the same time i do know the bandwidth issues of ilugc
and using/misusing it has to be handled by the list admin by looking the
issue to its merits.

If issues like drinking coke( i seen this issue in a thread) is been
classified a off-topic issues , we need a place to discuss broader spectrum
of change in the society. Policing on guidelines ruins the freedom instead
providing alternative idea/place/space on server may be appreciated.

You are correct - India does not yet have the capability of critical
Scientific Thought in the Western Tradition. The statistics on the
large numbers of scientists and engineers who graduate every year
are misleading - very few of them would be able to think independently.
We tend to follow the herd in Science and Technology.

Touche! The so-called IT revolution is also unsustainable, IMHO; but
it's probably better than the craze for heavy industry that characterized
the Nehruvian era. Let's see how it goes - but I see a tendency to
serfdom as a result of an emphasis on service (to the West, in this
case) rather than ownership/self-determination.

We could go with either an official ilugc-non-tech group,which can be forked
off from ilugc or create a differnet non-tech group which is in no way
connected to the LUG.

IF it's not an offshoot of ILUGC it would take some time for it to catch up
with the number of members.
Another problem is people will have to subscribe to *another* mailing
list.This would just make it a PITA.

Correct.
Social/Philosophical/Flame wars/Fun/non-free software discussions. We can
have all this on ilug-non-tech.
The new list(if it's an offshoot) will also move most of the bandwidth which
arises due to OT posts away from the main iitm server and off to Y! groups.

Right.So my vote is in on ilugc-non-tech *just* because the SNR will go up
on ilugc and most of the non-tech discussions which currently I think some
people just prefer to shift+del can be moved to ilugc-non-tech.

Cross-posting between ilugc and ilugc-non-tech however will not be allowed,
though mails can be directed to ilugc-non-tech if the List Admin feels they
do not belong in ilugc.

just my 2 paise.

Good. I just came in to see my ilugc folder reaching upto 301 unread
messages. Reason: I have lost interest in going through the non-tech
stuff.


It is high time someone created a non-tech mailing-list so we can keep
this one as technical as possible, and technical in the linux sense
that is, not like .NET or about Internet Explorer.

I have added the prefix for the subject [ILUGC-NON-TECH]

in this way you can track and filter the message.

Does one need a gmail id to join up a Google Group ?
Can G-Groups mail be sent to non-gmail id's ?

Y! Groups currently has that feature.If only gmail id's can be used then we
have a problem.

btw, all these mails should be going into the non-tech list. :P

hi,
my friend needs to install inux in his new nc6230 hp
compaq laptop.He tried with all live CD's(to get
familiarised) like knoppix 3 and finally ubuntu live
cd alone worked

Is there any way of finding which linux will suit his
laptop.
google could only provide methods to install drivers
for that laptop.All other live cd's started fine but
after the initial screen the screen went blank.

thanks in advance.

Hi All,
 CinePaint is a open source deep paint project lead by Robin for a
few years. CinePaint is used on many feature films for dust-busting,
retouching, etc. Currently the team is overhauling CinePaint with a new
architecture called
Glasgow that uses FLTK. Scheduled for release the end of this year. Will
replace legacy code based on Film Gimp and GTK1.

Looking for C++ developers interested in the motion picture industry who'd
like to join the team of a fun open source project.
 Please contact me off-list. I would consolidate and forward the list to
Robin.

Thank you!

Message-ID: <f125479205092410131c1a76e8@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Mr Mohammed Riyaz

At http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2005-July/019633.html I
see a post by you about finding the Fedora Core 3 driver for a "BiPAC
7000 ADSL USB Modem"

I am looking for the same. The drivers at
http://www.solwise.co.uk/adsl-billion-7000.htm#DRIVERS are meant for
only RedHat 7.1, 7.2, 8, 9 and Mandrake.

Did you finally get the right driver? Would you be able to guide me on this?

Or, is it possible to make some changes in the driver for RH9
(Solwise-RedHat-90i386.rpm) and make it work in Fedora 3?

Thanks in advance for your help

Regards

A Giridhar RAO

HP is supporting Linux by releasing its customized version of Ubuntu for 
laptops - nearly 100% hardware supported. Here is the link.
http://www.ubuntu.com/support/custom/hplaptops

Check with the http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/hp.html also. It was 
useful when I configure my nx6120.

Glad that the issue of trolling is brought up here. Wikipedia defines
trolling as "inflammatory messages intended to cause a disruption in
discourse. The word is also often used to describe such messages."

Quoting from a past post:

"I pity the users ignorance"

"crap"

If this aint trolling ....... what is?

New week blues. Will need time to reply to the above 3 posts.
Meanwhile, stumbled on this:

"It is sometimes argued that proprietary software, by being
proprietary, provides a necessary incentive for programmers to invent
and implement new ideas. We know that argument to be false; we are
building this area into a place where we can document all of the
innovations that have been developed and implemented by Free Software
programmers in Free Software programs."

It has been empty for the last 5 months! No. Am not taking this a
proof of 'lack' of innovation. Do contribute to this page.

and selected those modules listed in the guide,
   <*> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
   (Select this if you want MIDI sequencing and routing)
   <*> Sequencer support
   (Old style /dev/mixer* and /dev/dsp* support. Recommended.)
   <*> OSS Mixer API
   <*> OSS PCM (digital audio) API
I also selected the PCI sound devices, list my Sound card,
 which is Ali 5451 SOUND card,
when my kernel boots, i see a message, alsa loaded, soundcard not found
in list of sound cards.
When i get into my gnome , i find a striked out speaker icon on my top
right screen, when i click it i get a message that, /dev/sound/mixer not
found.
When i checked it, a /dev/sound exists, and /dev/mixer
/dev/mixer0..1.2.3 so on exists....
when i tried creating MAKEDEV sound/mixer it gave a error saying a
generic device cannot be created.
Then i ran MAKEDEV audio ..
but not difference.....

another problem is , my GDM is not  getting loaded at boot time, i have
to login in shell and run gdm each time,

DICT:
Algorithm is a precise rule (or set of rules) specifying how to solve
some problem; a set of procedures guaranteed to find the solution to a
problem. 

It is abstruct only in the implementation point of view, NOT from 
proplem point of view.

Many of the FOSS Project needs contributers. May be you can take-up
some projects GCC or Hurd project and see "How many new innovative
extensions/features added and list it down in the above link".

If you are NOT willing to contribute and only willing criticize then, 
there is no meaning in this discussion :)

The main issue in the closed vs. open debate is actually protocols/
data formats. This is still an issue even with FLOSS - although it may
be possible to examine the source to try to understand the protocols/
formats, it is by no means easy or even guaranteed to be possible -
remember that OpenOffice source is now over 100 MBytes.

That's why it's important to have open data formats, and also one
of the reasons that the State of Massachusetts has mandated that
all documents created for/by state agencies will have to be in one
of several open formats, including OpenDocument and PDF. IMHO,
this is a more practical and effective way for the Govt. to push
the use of open standards, than to try to prescribe the specific
software that is meant to be to used.

As long as the document format is open, I'm OK with the consumer
choosing either closed or open-source tools to manipulate it - from
a practical point of view, FLOSS tools will probably win on features
as well as reliability, but it will also allow ISVs to offer closed-source
solutions, *provided* it passes a rigorous test suite (say, it needs
to be able to read/write/print a large set of documents and have them
read/write/print correctly on a reference FLOSS implementation like
Abiword/OpenOffice as well).

Hi Giridhar

You can download the source for the driver from
http://www.billion.com/support/download/fd/fd1.htm , which you can compile
on most distros. However, my experience with this modem/driver has been bad.
The linux drivers for this USB based modem looks highly unstable (However, I
may be wrong, somebody correct me if I am). Finally, ended up shifting to an
ethernet based modem (PPPoE).

Good luck

Can you post the relavent kernel message? Use dmesg to pipe the output to a 
file and find that particular line:

$ dmesg > messages.txt

See if you can switch gnome to using ALSA instead of OSS - No idea where that 
would be, but it's in GStreamer configuration, most probably...

You using udev? If you are, udevd should do all makedev for you. And check the 
major, minor numbers of /dev/mixer* using ls -l. On my system, it's 14,0

Try this:
# rc-update add xdm default

This will add XDM, unless you go edit /etc/rc.conf to specify 
DISPLAYMANAGER=gdm (or xdm or kdm or whatever :) )

This one's actually in the handbook, I guess... Long time since I went through 
it that closely, though...

One Day One Command 
===================

strace -- Trace System Calls and Signals.

Summary:

In the simplest case strace runs the specified command until it exits.  
It intercepts and records the system calls which are called by a
process and the signals which are received by a process.  The name of
each system call, its arguments and its return value are printed.
strace is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool.

Examples:

$ strace sleep 1 -- Trace all Sys call of 'sleep' command.

$ strace ls -- Trace all Sys call of 'ls' command.

$ strace -i sleep 1 -- Print the value of the Instruction Pointer at
                       every sys call.

$ strace -r sleep 1 -- Print a relative time-stamp with each line of
                       the trace.

$ strace -t sleep 1 -- Prefix each line of the trace with the time of
                       day.

$ strace -T sleep 1 -- Show time spent on each call.

$ strace -o file sleep 1 -- Redirect the output to a file.

$ strace -c ls -- Count  time,  calls, and errors for each system call
                   and report a summary on program exit.

$ strace -xx myprg -- Print all strings in HEX format.

$ strace -e trace=file ls -- Trace all system calls which take a
                             filename as an argument. 

$ strace -e trace=process ls -- Trace all system calls which involve
                                process management.

$ sleep 60 & -- Dummy background Job.

$ strace -p 1234 -- Attach to the process with the PID 1234 (use 
                    dummy job's Pid) and trace.

Read: man strace

I am still using windows..  i tried quite a bit to get it working.. and
i had a feeling that if i tried a bit more i would have got it to work..
but i cudnt install fedora core 4 that time..  the hotplug thing in
fedora core 1 didnt not have the right firmware-agent.. so i needed to
install some newer distro..and morever u will need a 2.6 kernel to do
what i did.. and you need to know how to recompile the kernel.. so with
the distrubutions that i see u mention.. you need to upgrade you
kernel.. 

I had very little luck with the drivers provided by tataindicom or the
drivers on the website.. i read somewhere the this modem uses the
connexant chipset.. so i think the website was
accessrunner.connexant.com , anyway look for access runner + connexant
in google .. there they claim to have got the modem working with linux
and all instructions are given clearly in that page.. 

anyway here is the link http://accessrunner.sourceforge.net/

have fun.. and keep me posted with ur results..

no, it will not work on RH9 unless you get urselves a 2.6 kernel.. 

good luck.

   1. Your BIPAC 7000 ADSL USB Modem has been listed as supported modem in
   the accessrunner site in the given link:
   http://accessrunner.sourceforge.net/modems.shtml
   Try this driver.

   2. If the above driver does not work let me know. I have ADSL USB Modem
   (same conexant chipset as that of BIPAC 7000 - vendor id: 0x0572 and
   product id: 0xcb06) supplied by Airtel DSL Services working fine with some
   other driver I downloaded long back. It is working on both Redhat 8.0
   (kernel 2.4) and FC3 (kernel 2.6) just like that. Almost just install and
   no configuration except your ISP username and password through html
   interface. I think It should work for you also. This driver even works
   with Debian clones also.

Subject: [Ilugc] Problem with Microphone
Message-ID: <f190c8a505092622431f854db4@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,
Ive been trying to get my microphone to work. Im running Slackware
10.1, I have a Crystal Audio Sound card that works perfectly fine.
Ive tried both input channels (the mic and the line input one), and
I've turned up the Capture volume (using alsamixer). The mic playback
volume is on full, so I can hear myself speak. Unfortunately, Ive not
managed to record anything. I've tried KRec, Gnome Sound Recorder and
Audacity. The recording input widget in KDE doesn't show any input
either. I've googled a lot, this problem seems to be pretty common,
but none of the solutions I've found seem to work for me. Btw, Ive set
the permissions on /dev/dsp0 to 666, microphone boost is also on.
Any pointers? Any other suggestions for a recording program I can test
the mic with?

Thanks,
Aparajit

Most probably your I/P electronics and the ADC/DSP as well as device
driver, etc. are fully functional, and this is only a mixer/muting issue.
Check all the settings in alsamixer and/or aumix.

Bharti's summary explains it:

"The Linux Kernel keeps data in memory to avoid doing (relatively slow)
disk reads and writes.  This improves performance, but if the computer
crashes, data in memory may be lost or the file system corrupted as a
result."

The kernel automatically flushes these in-core buffers as and when
they become full; the sync(8) command (and the sync(2) system call) is
for forcing this flush operation.

Hi,

   I ve installed Fedora (Version is 10 I think, sorry not sure)
in my system a week back.  I ve Windows 2000 and XP in my system.
Yesterday when I try to get into Windows from LILO it shows an
message

 rootnoverify(hd0,0)
 Chainloader +1 

   I m not that much familiar with Linux but able to found that
this command runs from grub.conf, what might be the problem?

   Please suggest me a solution since there are some really
important files in my Windows folders.

  My HDD Capacity is 80 GB and I partitioned this to 5, making
every partition having 15 GB and I installed Windows 2000 in my C:
then XP in D: E: and F: dedicated to Windows and the remaining
15GB is assaigned to Linux.  I don t know whether any one of my
friends screwed up the system because of that it is coming like
this, please suggest me a solution.  I'm based in Chennai and if
you don't mind give me your contact number so that I can talk to
you directly.

Hi Joe,

Just check up if he has installed FC2.
FC2 had a bug in grub wherein it corrupted a Windows XP NTFS partition.
This bug was quite famous when FC2 came out.

The person mentions FC version as 10 which is unlikely. :)
One might need to look into fedora forums for a fix/workaround.

I'm not a FC user maybe Binand or other RH folk can provide better inputs.

ILUGC, though a linux users group, is here to encourge any Free(dom)
Software. Nothing wrong in discussing about hurd in this list.

However, everybody has freedom to start a new group.

Rich irony. In a temple of a movement that holds 'freedom of speech'
as the supreme ideal that even software should adhere to, the priest
has deemed that only those who contribute to it have the freedom to
speak!!!!

Will the act of buying support (which I never excercise) for an open
source product be construed as contribution for the movement? Will
this bring sudden meaning which was apparently non existent in this
discourse so far?

I do not understand why extraneous factors like my designation, domain
and my contribution to open source software will affect the validity
(or invalidity) of my arguements!

It would be better if counter arguements are made to my points solely
on its merit. Personalities and motivations of personalities dont
matter! In fact, I think that is the biggest advantage with the
electronic medium - it hides the irrelevant distractions. If you are
bothered that am doing this out of an ulterior motive to cast
aspersions on the open source movement rest assured that nothing can
be farther from the truth.

Subject: [Ilugc] NISG NeGP initiative at a cost of Rs.14,000 CRORES
Message-ID: <433A1F6A.70600@gmail.com>

National Institute for Smart Government (NISG) is driving the National 
e-Governance Plan (NeGP) and estimated to cost Rs. 14,000 Crores.

Governance has evolved by trial and error over a very long period of 
time, much the way free software evolves these days. Governance was 
thought best to be divided into legislative, executive and judiciary. 
eGovernance could avoid the many prejudices a human executive suffers, 
and the old divisions have to be redefined. Compare:

developer : user :: legislator : citizen

A BDFL manages the developer:user gap pretty much, and the right to fork 
satisfies the disgruntled in the unlimited virtual world. The 
legislator:citizen relationship is constrained severlely by limited 
resources, and there could be no right to fork. It is for this reason, 
the Constitutional machinery elaborately defines how citizens govern 
themselves by electing legislators. The existing Constitutional 
machinery assumes paper as the medium through which the laws will be 
executed. Writ of certiorari traditionally meant "calling for the 
(physical) records" - now, if a judge could "visit" the files through an 
electronic medium, the scope, nature and methods of the writ stands 
vastly modified. Each and every constitutional device, control and 
measure has to be modified to suit the new medium of execution. 
Traditionally, constitutions are classified as written and unwritten, 
and today we have to create a new classification electronic and 
non-electronic. The constitutional machinery has to be totally rebuilt 
from scratch to suit the new medium. eGovernance actually calls for 
serious debates on constitutional reform before spending a single rupee 
on any eGovernance program.

Sprinkling "IBM", "Linux", "Open Source", "Open Standards" and other 
catch words here and there over the project are mere incidental things 
that do not go to the core issues of governance. Does the GOI expect IBM 
to give the framework for eGovernance? Is Indian legislative history 
(1600 - 1950) repeating itself ? E-Courts has been added to their 
planning boards as an after thought, and clearly shows poor planning. 
Burning 14K Crores (in two years ?) over NeGP, that too controlled by 
NASSCOM sounds very stupid, to say the least. They are looking for 
consultants (apply at your own risk ;) and I hope they don't get too 
smart ;) Bullock carts fitted with electric motors won't move 
efficiently - NiSG is only doing this and this is not my imagination: 
their advt calling for consultants has the wheel of a bullock cart with 
an e in the centre :)

There are other strange issues there too:

Is it PPP ?

NISG has to be AUDITED by CAG

HURD uses Linux - not as a kernel but the drivers I believe. Anand Babu 
talked about the contribution by Samiyundu who wrote the wrappers for 
doing that.   It is not HURD vs. Linux or some such thing, but having 
more freedom ultimately ;)   HURD users are therefore Linux users :)  
Please correct me if I am wrong.

As a last resort you can boot your system with a windows boot disk,
and in C: type "fdisk /mbr".
This will restore the MBR in your active partition and you can boot
into windows.
Booting into Linux won't be possible because this command  overwrites grub.

   For example, if you are using a old hard disk with latest processor
   system, the seek time of hdd will be more which will be lagging behind the
   processor speed. When the logs are written in a file in hdd, you may not
   able to see the appending of data in a log file immediately through 'tail
   -f logfile' command. just a 'sync' will set right it. I found this command
   useful in sco-unix systems.

 Bharti's summary explains it:

 "The Linux Kernel keeps data in memory to avoid doing (relatively slow)
 disk reads and writes.  This improves performance, but if the computer
 crashes, data in memory may be lost or the file system corrupted as a
 result."

 The kernel automatically flushes these in-core buffers as and when
 they become full; the sync(8) command (and the sync(2) system call) is
 for forcing this flush operation.

This assumes importance because you are concerned only about business
making money - as we could understand from tenor of your arguments-
you don't seem to value freedom of human beings Most of your
arugments weren't making much sense for customers, they are oriented
towards software companies.

Well your arguments aren't without business bias. eg. look at your
reply below to my points on controlling function
quote
It is not the govts business - at least not directly. If your browser
takes you to an illegal site use another browser. Market forces will
eleminate faulty browsers.

Look, you are looking whole this as just market - pure business look.
Have market force eliminated the 95% share faulty browser? It is only
the opensource which give as sembalance of fight.
Tell me what is duration in which market force will set right - 5
years, 10 years or infinite years?
This market force argument is nonsense-look at the prices of drugs,
what has market force,patents etc have done - just increase the
prices and bring in unwanted drugs and their side effects on us. The
so called market forces company quote nearly 1/3 rate for govt
supply. What does it mean either you cheat govt by supplying mud - or
you cheat customer with exhorbitant cost.
I, as a user not keen on which market force scores over other. If my
government can step in and have control it is good. Government is
there is Govern.

Actually I dont' want to continue the arugment, so I didn't reply,
but you last post made to reply.

Bharti wanted to put a fulstop, because you dont seem to be looking
things in full, just looking through business-money glass and
forgetting freedom angle.

Well, this will be my last post in this thread

A piece of info that certainly needs debate. Thanks for the info
Ramanraj. But it is likely this is considered 'non-technical' in this
list and hence put a lid on. And don't be surprised if your domain,
designation, contributions and maybe even political leanings are
called into question in the process :-)

I don't understand why this debate is taking place.
ILUG-"C" is for the Linux users of *Chennai*.
IHUG is the *national* Indian HURD users group.

We have a BSD group for India.Even they make use of Linux drivers but you
can't say BSD is Linux.

or even fixboot from windows 2000 and XP boot cd will help..
execute fixboot from command prompt in repair after giving the
administrator password...
this will restore the windows boot screen sequences.. and one can
successfully boot into windows for the movement.

Thanks for the input. I've now tried _all_ possible mixer settings :).
Still doesn't work. People seemed to have got things working if they
ran alsaconf as root. That didn't work either. Anyone whos had a

Is it LILO or GRUB.
There is nothing wrong with those commands. It is chainloading. Use
GRUB (if not), it is better.

The following is for creating a LiveCD distribution
(if you haven't already come across it):

http://www.linux-live.org/

It might be useful in tweaking an existing
distribution to build one that suits your needs.

Have fun,

Hello all -

Let me first explain you the reason behind starting this group. As far 
as Hurd is concerned, there are only limited set of support resources 
available on the web. But most of these resources are outdated. When a 
new user who would like to try out Hurd, I think that he feels a bit 
lost even after googling enough. People can subscribe to help-hurd 
mailing list. But it has a very low (really low) signal to noise ratio. 
A lot of spams posted everyday. I have observed that people from our 
group like Shakthi Kannan, Joe Steeve, Anand Babu are doing a good work 
having a good amount of knowledge on Hurd. If we can get them join in 
one place to provide valuable help for Hurd users, it would be great.

It is true that most of the Hurd users are Linux users but not even a 
considerable amount of Linux users are Hurd users. I don't think all 
Linux users in the UG will welcome Hurd discussions. At some point in 
time or the other, flame wars may rise. As the number of Hurd users are 
very less at this point in time, it would not be ideal to have a region 
specific UG in India. So, we thought it would be better to have a nation 
wide UG instead of having it region specific like Bangalore, Chennai or 
Delhi. Now in our group, we have users from Chennai, Bangalore, Delhi, 
Goa, etc. With this diversity of users, it is known fact that we can't 
meet physically as the typical LUG meeting. Instead, the meeting would 
be on IRC similar to the traditional meeting of any free software 
developers community.

Please do correct us if our stand is wrong in this aspect.

Thanks -
Praveen.

 thanks a lot for the link.We have already visited that link but we dont
want to concentrate in LiveCD.
I have also checked with customizing Knoppix.

As Sujith said it seems that the MBR file has been overwritten. 
Using a windows boot disk you can fix the mbr by giving the following command:
      c:\>fdisk /mbr
This will fix your windows booting problem. But you will not be able to boot into linux anymore as the mbr is again over written with the 'fdisk /mbr' command.
 
To recover linux boot:
I have got a way which I have published in my blog:
 
Please visit: http://geekollection.blogspot.com/2005/04/get-back-dual-boot-linux-windows.html
 
I hope this will help you recover the dual boot.

I did that recently and my C: partition vanished.
Booting using a windows boot disk and checking C: gave me the error,

"Invalid System Drive
Abort,Ignore,Fail"

I tried re-formatting C:, reloading the boot record using 'fdisk /mbr' and
creating boot.ini from scratch. Nothing worked.
I had to install XP again.
Dunno if I inadvertantly made a mistake  and installed grub on the
wrong partition or somethin'.

BTW, I went through all that pain to install XP because my TV tuner card
doesn't work in Linux.I have a FC 4 with 2.6.12 ker.
The tuner card is a cheap Intex make. It has a saa7134 chipset.
I tried fiddling with the kernel module trying all sorts of
combinations with the tuner.
And successfully made it work. It works the first time I open xawtv.
If I close the app and re-open it, all I get is static.

Pointers ?

 there are various reasons for building a customized distribution.We are

good and reliable..but why dont we try?...thats when u can feel the real

First: Don't top post.

Second: Why re-invent the wheel ?
There is a perfectly good initiative called IndLinux
http://indlinux.orgwhich is heavily into
localization.Why don't you and your friends join up with them and better
that distro rather than start afresh ?

Anyway, I always thought installing debian using the basedebs.tar.gz package
as a form of customized distro,ofcourse you don't compile packages(but
install binaries,deb's) but starting off with a minimal Debian distro gives
you the same freedom which you can find in a LFS based one.

u wont loose linux completely, u will only loose the entrance to it..
u can get back linux to work fine, no need installation ....

but the thing is, you should try what i have suggested if u want to get
into windows desperately, do this as it takes just a few seconds to set
thing to normal when windows is concerened....
and since u are using Fedora , getting the dual boot back is not a
problem at all once windows is working fine.

Your efforts will gain you experience on building a distro, but that's it.
You'd better help in translation work in existing distro (Ubuntu is
progressing, it as 'language packs')

hey aparajit, have u ensured that the software you're using have been

esound or something like that. may be u can provide the output of
/proc/asound/cardN/pcmNc/subN/status (N is usually 0), while you try
to record. It should say RUNNING. In case the app supports OSS, may be
u can try the OSS emulation of ALSA (u will need to modprobe
snd-pcm-oss and snd-mixer-oss) or try running the program with aoss.
That will perhaps help us decide if it is indeed a configuration
problem.

You can get from BSNL itself. The modems provided by them are
compatible with GNU/Linux. For me they have given UTSTAR ADSL MODEM
(ethernet). It's doing great. BTW,  similar modem should be available
in ritche street as well. On the other hadn, on configuration front,
you can set the userid/password in the modem. It would enable you to
connect to internet without making configuration in your software
irrespective of the OS.

Linux based Education Live CD called Freeduc(?) is already availalbe 
in Net. It is very useful for schools. I don't know whether install 
option is available or Not.

1) If NOT, Make installable.
2) Add more Education Tools
3) add open office into it.
4) add simple devel tools

If you can do it in single CD then, I hope, It is useful to 
distribute for our schools.

Bye :)

I appreciate your enthusiasm for creating a new distro from scratch,
but like others have said, it would be great if you could consider
incorporating your ideas to some existing distro, unless you really
feel that *all* existing distro are not fundamentally suited for your
improvements. Distros like debian, gentoo have excellent systems in
place which allow enormous customization, and will most probably have
mechanisms to include your ideas. Even if they don't, I'm sure they
will love patches which help making their framework much more flexible
and accomodating. Having said all this, if your motive is purely
educational, a new distro is a great idea, but please ensure that you
either merge your ideas into some existing distro or atleast list them
down in some distro wishlist, so that other ppl could probably take it
up...

it moves on....

In general, any ethernet modem (that works with PPPoE) will be fine with 
Rp-PPPoE. That is to say, any ethernet modems will work. If they insist on 
giving you an idiotic USB modem (and ONLY as a last option), try to get a 
Globespan based one, since we have a usermode driver for that.

Finally, if you're using multiple systems, it makes more sense to have a DSL 
router and a hub or a switch. Sure, it costs (much) more, but it's worth it. 
You can get a DLink router here in India, which is quite good...

Just be sure you get all (and I mean ALL) the configuration details from the 
BSNL guys - VPI/VCI, login and password.

I have been using a 3Com OfficeConnect ADSL+Wireless router (not to
mention a 4-port hub), and it has been plug & play with all the ADSL
providers I have tested it so far.

Freeduc is customised knoppix. It is possible to install.

I my opinion if Mr.Chakkradeep can do what Bharati suggested and
release it for all Indian languages, he would have done greatest
service for taking free software to schools in India, especially
rural India.

The link to site : ofset.org/freeduc.

Freeduc CD is available with me, you want please contact me.

To add to the earlier suggestions:

1) Try optimizing/reducing the memory
footprint of Freeduc to get it run OK in 128 MB of RAM - this will increase
the usability on low-spec machines and also help increase awareness.

2) Try integrating Abiword as the default word-processing app instead of
OpenOffice.

This is mainly because some online-dictionary server and http server
running.
In our school situation we may not need them as internet is rare.
Similarly cups is also started default, probably we can make them
start on request.
Many more customisation simple yet useful can be done

Good suggestion.

I have a list of application to be added which can benefit student
community, if anybody is interested in the project, I can contribute
my ideas.

We can add some quiz related to their course also.

This project, if we can do and distribute CDs to schools across
India, will be fitting reply to proprietary companies in educational
sector.

Not *idiotic* as in bad technology, but idiotic as in "don't have decent 
drivers for anything but Windows". They don't have a standard, and the 
manufacturers refuse to release specs... The technology itself, I like... :)

Ya, even i would recommend you to go for BSNL's modem only... for many
reasons...
1. is that , you will get support from their engineers when even
necessary, ( if you are not a expert in configuring things, i would
recommend you this.)
2. is that, most of the online help and docs you find are mostly written
keeping in mind the BSNL modem, so even if you try configuring them your
self, you may find difficulty in corelating things, as all modem's
interfaces are all not alike, (infact, even same company models have
different interfaces for configuring.)
3. The modem BSNL provides is good in cost and features etc .. unless
you are thinking to go for a wireless or other featured modems.
Configuring the modems to work is really an easy task, you need to do
hit and trail methods untill you find the right settings. ( At least
this happend for me , for my DLINK Modem)

Several reasons:

1) The functional partitioning is not clean - there need to be several
layers
inside the USB Modem (USB client-side stack, PPPoA emulation, ADSL
end-point stack, ...). There has to also be a functional Linux host driver
that
can talk to such a complex device, that will work with a wide variety of USB
host-side chipsets and drivers (OHCI, UHCI, EHCI, ...).

The odds of this happening are low - the far-eastern manufacturers tend
to have poor records in implementing Linux drivers themselves, and they
rarely release good documentation for their product implementations.

2) USB is host-side CPU resource hog - it tends to use interrupts for just
about anything, soaking up a lot of CPU cycles on ISRs, context-switches
and cache/TLB flushes. The reasons for this are historical - Intel wanted
to sell faster and faster PII/PIII CPUs, and the best way to convince users
to upgrade was to use up CPU cycles on USB.

You'll be better off without a single connected USB device on your
system. If you ever need to use it all, use it sparingly, for instance
to download images from a Digicam.

3) The alternative is to use an Ethernet-connected ADSL modem.
These are cleaner/simpler implementations, using PPPoE or vanilla
TCP/IP over Ethernet. The odds of getting all the stacks working
well are far better.

good information siva,
Most of the ADSL modems come with both USB as well as Ethernet support,
but most of the vendors and ISP(Broabband) provider doesnt know about
the details.. they just say, we want USB Modem only ..

Message-ID: <fa9c0711050928224850c87981@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everybody,
 first i would like to thank everyone in this group for your replies.I was
really happy to see the replies.Since i could reply for every mail, am
starting another theread..
 Many had given me new ideas.Well, the reason why we chose to go from
scratch and not taking an existing distro is, -

Suppose u find something has to be tweaked or optimized in the existing
distro,anyhow u have to re-compile the package (or) if u find some problem
with that version used u have to install the proper version.Now what happens
is, we would not know whether removal of that particular package will affect
the system or not.This will become very critical.

Suppose at the same time if u have proper documentation on each and every
package provided by the system, then it would be good to proceed with the
existing distro.

The idea of promoting Linux at Schools is an excellent start.Anyway we need
all the optimizations and tweakings done.If proper documentation is there
for the freeduc edition in the packages list and the base-system, it would
be gud to proceed.Otherwise, it will be very tough.People who can help me
with freeduc can approach me.I tried the link http://ofset.org/freeducgiven,
but it didnt work.

Creating LiveCDS will help us in the initial stages, but once people get
used to our distro, it is good to have an installable system.LiveCDS can be
used for just Demo and learning purpose.

I have good experience in LFS and we also have LFS plan put up.But that is a
long way.....we integrated RPM with LFS and had a base system with PM in a
stand alone system but it was difficult for us to create a base system
installer.We have to plan for such a environment.

Am also working with YOPER and i have seen their's Base System
Development.It closely resembles LFS.How YOPER is the fastest OS ?..its
because of the optimizations they have used in their kernel and in other
packages.

We are also trying to get a base system, and build from there.But until now
we havent thought of any good base system.I think we will be trying with the
Debian Base System...any ideas in this?..whatever the case, base system
should be stable,reliable and updatable...

hope i made clear a little bit..

with regards,

hi you can do that in using PPPOE and RP-PPOE,
if using fedora, there is a menu option for configuring the broadband
internet....
If you are using the Ethernet ADSL modem, you need not even configure
anything except you ip address and gateway... ( you need to do this in
case your ADSL modem doesnt provide DHCP service).  ( This is the case
for my DLINK ADSL MODEM , which once configured, stores the settings..

Does this sync needs to be done always.. or we can control the way it
works... for example whether we can make it to update as and when data
is available.. Wont it be useful in a high end machines?

Hi,

My thoughts below:

1. Although USB high-speed (HS) is 480 Mbps compared
to ethernet 100 Mbps, most USB devices can only behave
as "devices" that can be connected to a computer or
USB hub. Only now you will find USB OTG products in
the market, US and Taiwan.

2. Its easier and cheaper to setup a LAN with ethernet
than USB.

3. Most ISPs provide USB modems so that you can only
use one computer with the Internet. If you want to use
it with another computer, they will ask you to buy
another connection? This is what Touchtel told me.
There was one ISP marketing guy who told me it was
illegal to share bandwidth from the ISP connection.
Huh! I referred him to RFC 1631 for doing NAT (at
home):

http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1631.html

4. USB was primarily designed for embedded than for
large networks.

5. Most USB modems are like winmodems, with vendors
not providing much details on their chipsets.

HTH,

SK

Subject: [Ilugc] Bandwidth dividing software
Message-ID: <5ef2113c05092900565e340d63@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to know if there is any bandwidth dividing software in
GNU/Linux.. I dont know whether am giving a correct term "Bandwidth
dividing"... The problem is i want to configure a GNU/Linux box to act
as a switch which divides the available bandwidth between the users..
for example if 10 nodes are connected to a GNU/Linux box which has two
ethernet cards, one which connects to a public IP and other serves the
LAN comprising of the 10 nodes, so between these 10 nodes i would like
to give 128kpbs for 2 nodes, 64kbps for 5 nodes and 32 kbps for
remaining nodes, assuming that i get a 256kbps connection from my
ISP.. Is this possible to achieve by configuring a software in
GNU/Linux, if so i would like to know the software(s) availble for
this :)

No need. Only when you want to push the buffered data to disk. 
Normally system sync the data periodically at some time(5Sec?)

Oh thank you for that information ... if it is done so frequently ie.,
once in every five seconds then i think we dont want to control it to
update immediately...

That (illegality of sharing bandwidth) might make sense if it was in the terms 
of service. But I doubt that they actually put that in. The touchtel guys, in 
fact, were the ones who suggested a router for us.

Anyway, thanks for the RFC, it's interesting... :-)

I use touchtel, no problems with sharing connectivity. :)
Just show the sales guy a Linux login and tell him that you use Linux/UNIX.
He'll just panic and say "USB modems may not run,Sir".

Insist on a Ethernet based Modem,remember the word "ethernet" keep saying
that otherwise he'll just get you a USB one.It also "behaves" as a router
with NAT,DHCP etc.

When the install guy gets the router/modem, get him to setup the h/w and
then just open firefox and point it to the ethernet modem(something like
192.168.1.1 <http://192.168.1.1>).He'll take care of the rest.

Assign an IP to your PC (192.168.1.3 <http://192.168.1.3>) and you are good
to go.

Use the modem/router's IP as your gateway.

The problems were specific to their deployment of SAP on RedHat, and their
inability to hire a competent IT team to deploy it. There are any number of
unsuccessful/delayed/bloated deployments of SAP on any platform, so this
is not surprising. BTW, SAP is not very well regarded for their Linux
support -
that may change eventually.

Those idiots actually wanted to automate their application of updates (they
call it "auto-patch" - M$ terminology). It's fairly easy with RHN and/or
yum,
but why would anybody do that in a production environment? There are no
serious holes in a typical RHEL install, so I'd simply let it run in peace
and
manually update selective RPMs based on RedHat update notifications, say
once a month, unless there is a major security update. There's never any
need to keep updating stuff on a Linux distro all the time - that's only
common
in the M$ world ("Patch Tuesday"), but that's the culture these guys come
from, so it's no surprise that their deployment failed.

-Siva

P.S. "Patching" means very different things in the Unix/Linux and M$ worlds
- one never patches a Linux binary, you only update a package or bunch of
packages. You only patch source code in the Linux world, never a binary
on a production server.

 for a simple and easy way, if u r using FireFox , there is a add-on called
BandWidth Tester which will test ur bandwidth...i used to check using
that...am not sure whether it is efficient also...

I am not sure about whether u have a email client  called Evaluation.

Well if you are taking about Evolution then the following is the
solution:

The outlook express uses the .dbx format.
Evolution uses the .mbx format.

Convert all the .dbx files to .mbx format using the following freely 
available tool
     http://people.freenet.de/ukrebs/dbxconv.html

Its called the dbxconv.exe

Once you are done with the conversion,copy these to your linux
partition.

>From the menu of evolution import all the .mbx files.

And Bingo ...... You have your old mail form Outlook express in
Evolution

Dear sudharsan.

here is the solution to calculate the transfer
through the network card eth0 or ppp0.

open any console
login as root
type ifconfig
it will give the network details.

for example, here is my output of ifconfig.
I have one Lan card as etho.
lo is loop back.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:00:21:EF:9D:DB
          inet addr:192.9.204.214  Bcast:192.9.204.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:4262355 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:28899 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:5745
>         RX bytes:281297694 (268.2 Mb)  TX bytes:5515392 (5.2 Mb)

lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
          RX packets:83664 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:83664 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0
          RX bytes:4324366 (4.1 Mb)  TX bytes:4324366 (4.1 Mb)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

note the line denoted as ">" by me.
RX=received  TX=transmitted
it is the amount from system boot.
I have received 268.2MB data from by system boot., through lan.
my system uptime is 11 hrs.

so, for you, i hope ifconfig will show ppp0
after connecting to net, watch ifconfig.
while finishing surfing, watch it and note it down before disconnecting.

try it out and send the results.
i hope it will work for u and satisfy ur need.
if it is not worthy, tell me.
i will search any tool or try to write any script.

ok?

bye n wishes.

dear,
T.Shrinivasan.

Great thread for discussing about the state of our schools.

I stumbled upon another ineresting link www.schoolforge.net

and also http://www.schoolforge.net/software.php

It is better if we start something for our schools in our local languages
(small countries where the entire population will not be equal to some three
or four districts in our states have been doing that) It is high time that
we start doing something for our schools

Can use tcpdump if you don't want a GUI. I believe
ethereal uses tcpdump internally.

What about vnstat?

I think EtherReal user libpcap library  not tcpdump internally.
Tcpdump and almost all network capture tools use pcal library.

More correctly, ethereal and tcpdump (and several other tools - ntop,
ngrep, nessus, snort...) use libpcap internally for packet capture.

Hi, i was wonderin if what u have mentioned above is 
restricted to only BSNL USB Modems or is it the case
with all USB Modems? So will i be better off takin
an ethernet one instead of a USB one? Also, is there
any way of connecting to the internet from more than 
one system (simultaneoulsy) while using a USB modem??

Every single USB modem made - BSNL doesn't use anything special... Get the 
ethernet modem!

To answer your second question, I used to do that with a Globespan modem, 
running a NAT server on one system and having everyone connect to that as the 
primary gateway. Unfortunately, it requires the NAT to be online all the 
time. But otherwise, it's decent.

Ofcourse. Install an ethernet card, connect it to your LAN and
configure this system as your LAN gateway.

I have 2 linux servers running redhat Enterprise server 2.x. Each run a

achieve 99% availability. The requests from the client are sessionless. 
But for every request from the client, the JVM does a DB hit. right now 
the client just hits randomly one of the boxes, if the response is a 
failure or a timeout, it tries the next one.

how can I build high availability and failover within the linux servers?

All USB modems - Dial-up, ISDN, DSL, Cable ...

So will i be better off takin

Yes, it's more likely that ethernet-connected modems will work
out of the box.

Also, is there

Yes, the machine which connects to the net using the USB
modem should be made into a NAT gateway, and all the
other machines connect to this gateway using Ethernet.

Even this becomes easier if you use an ethernet-connected
modem - there are existing router-centric distros (like Routerlinux)
that will work out of the box with just about any ethernet-connected
modem, and turn the machine into an extremely reliable and secure
NAT/router/firewall box that can easily replace a few $30k Cisco
boxes.

This thread has dragged on for too long for everyone's comfort! My
initial question is still unanswered. Maybe because there is no answer
for it yet! But I found this a stimulating exchange. Helped clarify
some points and raised more questions (which is not bad actually). Of
course there were acrimonious posts (aggravated further by me).
Apologies to all aggravated parties :-)

I find it difficult to base my inferences on dogmas (source code is a
fundamental right, businesses are bad etc). I think it will clarify
our thoughts and reinforce our sense of purpose if we periodically
question the very dogmas. But at some level I think one has to have
faith in something to base all his inferences on. I, conveniently base
mine on the kural:

Epporul yaar yaar vai ketpinum
Apporul meiporul kaanbatharivu

(roughly translated it means, 'whatever is said by whoever,
intelligence is to question it till you reach the truth'   purists pls
pardon me) A pretty recursive dogma :-) Questions every creed, every
faith.

The somewhat hazy conclusion I have come to now is that open source
and closed source software will co-exist till it is emphatically
proven that closed source is evil.

As for the last posters accusation about my business bias: I tried my
best to avoid all biases from my arguements. Apologize if some creeped
in. But then, businesses are not evil. They serve an important purpose
in society. Am sure a discussion on this will surely be deemed OT. So
if you are willing, post to ilugc non tech mailing list your vision of
a society driven by purely non profit organizations :-)

There are many more thoughts to provoke.....

Dear Mano,

I appreciate your thoughts that too when most of the gurus are on 
opposite line. You have managed to invoke thought process of every one 
in this mailing list. That is the success of this thread and of course 
the Open Source World. I have taken many positive points you have 
mentioned about open source and also negative points. Our Linux Gurus 
here will definitely take it in positive way. Let us work hard to fix 
this negative aspect if any (in one's point of view).

Regards
T.KaruppuSwamy

Dear Mano and all,

I am reproducing something interesting that was exchanged y'day. It may not
be directly relevant to the point, but I think indirectly, yes. Let me have
the views of other, if worthwhile to be responded by anyone!!

Kris.

Shri. Surendra,
Lok Satta.

Thanks. To answer your question: If India wins, who loses?

If India wins - Our politicians will loose!!
If India wins - Our Corrupt will loose!!
If India wins - The Rich will loose!!
If India wins - The powerful will loose!!
If India wins - Western World will loose!!
If India wins - UN / World Bank will loose!!
If India wins - Hypocrisy will loose!!

If India wins - Everyone other than the honest and the poorest of the poor
citizen will loose.

Would we ever allow India to win is the question?! No. We all want to win
individually, at the cost of India!!!

We need a national debate of all right thinking people of India on this
topic!!! I am ready for it.

From: Shiva Shankar <sshankar@cmi.ac.in>

Dear Friends,
        As you know, Dalits affected by the Tsunami have been left out in
the cold, with neither the state government nor NGOs willing to provide
even elementary relief.
        The Sakya Foundation (a grouping of Ambedkarite Buddhists) has
therefore stepped in to provide some succour. We have rented a house at
Manali (New Town) to accomodate children from Nagapattinam and Cuddalore
who have lost parents in the Tsunami (the Sakya Foundation does not
discriminate - the children are from various "communities" - Dalit,
Meenavar (fisherfolk), Muslim etc). These children, at present 60 in
number, are looked after and sent to a local corporation school.
        Impressed by this effort, Professor A.Uma of the Humanities Dept.
of the Central University at Hyderabad has donated a computer (together
with printer etc). We need some person who will check out the computer,
install more software that the children can use and also teach a few
senior children some basics. This will take four or five sessions I
expect.
        I go every Saturday to Manali New Town to teach the children
mathematics. If some person is willing to help with the computer, I can
take the person along with me.
        In anticipation of some help I offer my heartfelt thanks.
                                        Shiva Shankar,
                                        Chennai Mathematical Institute.

Innovations have been there., it depends on what you consider as an
innovation. Though the Linux kernel is based on UNIX ideas., the
implementation of it has a number of innovations which UNIX did not
have. Loadable kernel modules, Anticipatory I/O scheduling, etc.. The
entire design of the gnu/hurd is a innovation.

Now., these innovations may not be obvious to a business person who
does not know the details of OS technology. A business person., or a
end user merely terms `innovation` as what he can see. However, it is
not so. All technical innovations need not be pleasing or acceptable to
a business person., and vice versa. Now., that is the reason why many
people on this thread where particular on the angle in which you were
approaching the topic, based on your domain/expertise.

Each expert in his area of skill (webservers/ databases/etc..), would
be able to list innovations like these. It depends on what you
acknowledge as a innovation.

You have to add the list of hosts allowed to access other X Server. This 
can be done with xhost command as shown below:
# xhost +<your local host name>
This should  be run at other X Server.

is there any solution for this.

I found the following url may be useful in answering the above snippet.

Interestingly the author compares the closed source application to a gun
which serves for self defence and also for killing a rival.

Go into rescue mode using original media, mount root filesystem,
chroot there, mount other filesystems and run authconfig (or
system-config-authentication or redhat-config-authentication - not
sure which one for RH9) again.

I think you can also go for iptables.

there is  a rate limiting feature in iptables that can be used.

it is useful if as u can also go for a firewall at the interface.


u can go for squid then u will require a slightly powerful system, but
it will let u do a lot more like content filtering and caching.

make ur choice.

no need to do all that.

u can go to single user mode by passing init parameter to the grub,
which can be done by getting into the edit mode ( use 'e')

then select the kernel line and append it with 1( for single user mode)

once the system has booted up, open the file

/etc/nsswitch.conf
and change or remove the order correspong to users and passwd.
or add entries for loacl accounts,


hope this helped.

Also one of my relatives is using a DLINK DSL502T (~Rs. 2k) ADSL
modem. It has one ethernet, one ADSL and one USB interfaces and it
works fine with the BSNL DataOne connection. Connect it to the
ethernet and it works good. As far as the USB interface is concerned
drivers are provided for Windows.

Also this box runs linux. You can telnet to the machine and busybox pops up.
Configuring the box is thro' the http interface and its simple. Also
incase of difficulties i guess the BSNL guys will help in configuring
it.

And as icing on the cake, it offers a whole host of advanced features from 
port forwarding, filtering, DMZ and a firewall... :)

But the USB interface seems to be a slight waste, IMO. For one thing, it makes 
more sense to use the router with a network than a single system, and for 
another, why a USB when you've got ether?

Subject: [Ilugc] Does India have a backbone?
Message-ID: <433D33FC.1020001@gmail.com>

http://www.ieo.org/backbone.html is a little old dating back to 1997, 
but I would like to know if India does have a backbone atleast now.  
traceroute www.chennailug.org went all the way to NY etc but ultimately 
never reached the destination in time.  Would a backbone of our own mean 
better internet facilities, and would it also mean that  traceroute 
www.chennailug.org would never leave Indian jurisdiction (atleast most 
of the time) ?

Thanks,
Ramanraj K

I believe the open source exponent should not try to achieve
conversion by grandstanding, or moralizing or appealing to the 'good
nature' of people. If its being for the good of humanity was reason
enough for people to adopt it, we would have far fewer problems in the
world. Rather, compelling and persuading the non-believer, and not
giving in to throwing one's arms up, is probably the way to go.
Undoubtedly the OSS movement has produced many fantastic innovations,
its a given considering the brilliant and focused brains behind the
project. Explaining this with a pinch of patience does not detract
from the idea.
And making money or business is not evil (yet :). Most of us need our
salaries, I guess. I don't think the world as a whole has evolved
enough to base decisions on altruism, the bottom line continues to
drive the world, and that might not necessarily be a bad thing.
Just my thoughts,
Aparajit
