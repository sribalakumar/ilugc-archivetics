It happened at a FOSS conference.
The developer works on Apache Maven
The sexism was in slides of the developer's talk on Maven.

The article should be useful for some FOSS people presenting their
talks at conferences/events.

I don't think AtlasCamp which is the developer conference of Atlassian, is
a FOSS conference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Thanks for the correction... it is in foss channels because of Maven
and OSS connections of the company.

Message-ID: <CAK2rq7xgFz3nYcV3dqz-z2DyC2bfXGN-5Wt256Gins-NgCMUQg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

My review-of-sorts on Linux Mint Cinnamon...

________________________________________________________

I have been running the Cinnamon DE on my Mint Box for past few months
and must admit that I'm greatly impressed with it. It features a
polished and elegant interface and is fluid and responsive to my
workflow and computing needs.

For those of you do not know about the project, Cinnamon is a fast
evolving, sleek, solid and modern Linux desktop maintained by Linux
Mint team and built with help of a vibrant community. It is a fork of
GNOME shell team but with an intention to offer the traditional
desktop metaphor to the user. With every release, developers have done
a wonderful job of creating a stable environment by incrementally
adding features and have made using the desktop a breeze.

I would like to briefly touch upon the salient features offered by
Cinnamon desktop, viz, A. Control Center / System Settings B. Cinnamon
Spices C. Window / Workspace management

*Control Center / System Settings*

Cinnamon features a very intuitive and powerful customization tool to
mandodify the desktop to one's preferences. It allows you to customize
appearance like changing default font of the system, setting keyboard
shortcuts, manage hardware settings (bluetooth, printers, etc) ,
change default behavior and administrative tasks such as adding users
/ groups.

some nice workspace features. Those who use window decorations and title
menu per app will find this a little odd as by default there is no
decoration.

I installed it on Ubuntu. This is a highly configurable WM with the
complete menu system and keyboard/ mouse shortcuts programmed in Lua. One
has to launch services and applets explicitly. Strict systray
implementations only work from Ubuntu. So some things like calender widget,
BT etc do not work.

Not for the fainthearted but does not need a nerd to use it either. I use
it with minimal services and the desktop comes up in under 5 seconds from
the login manager. Standard unity takes well over 45 seconds.

Good wiki at awesome.nasquadah.org

Hi Geeks,

Just came across this link and though it will interest most of you.

http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/06/05/darpa-hold-2m-grand-challenge-fully-automated-cyber-defense-systems/

For those who are paranoid to click on my link shown above I have copy
pasted from their website.

DARPA to hold $2m Grand Challenge for ?fully automated? cyber defense
systems

The hi-tech research wing of the US military DARPA (Defence Advanced
Research Projects Agency) is to hold the first ?fully automated? DARPA
Grand Challenge, with a $2 million prize offered for a fully automated
defense system ? a computer that defends itself without human intervention,
according to CBS News.

In an official release, DARPA said of Cyber Grand Challenge, ?Over the next
two years, innovators worldwide are invited to answer the call of Cyber
Grand Challenge. In 2016, DARPA will hold the world?s first all-computer
Capture the Flag tournament live on stage co-located with the DEF CON
Conference in Las Vegas where automated systems may take the first steps
towards a defensible, connected future.?

Thirty-five teams of academics and security researchers will compete. DARPA
points out that the recently discovered Heartbleed bug went undiscovered by
automated systems ? but was found by humans.

In an official release, the Department of Defense said that the goal of the
contest was to create systems that could respond to cyberattacks ?as fast
as they are launched?.

The winning team from the Cyber Grand Challenge finals stands to receive a
cash prize of $2 million. Second place can earn $1 million, and third place
$750,000. V3 reports that the first qualifying round will be held in 2015.

Competitions similar to the Grand Challenge have been held at Def Con for
decades, The Register reports ? the only difference being the stipulation
that the defense systems be ?human free?.

The site quotes the agency?s Mike Walker, saying, ?The only effective
approach to defending against today?s ever-increasing volume and diversity
of attacks is to shift to fully automated systems capable of discovering
and neutralizing attacks instantly.?

DARPA says, ?Today?s attackers have the upper hand due to the problematic
economics of computer security. Attackers have the concrete and inexpensive
task of finding a single flaw to break a system.?

?Defenders on the other hand are required to anticipate and deny any
possible flaw ? a goal both difficult to measure and expensive to achieve.
Only automation can upend these economics.?

DARPA is credited with inventing a precursor of the current internet,
according to CBS, and with other innovations such as the self-driving car
and humanoid robots. This year, the agency showed off a concept for a
 ?virtual reality? computer defense system, as reported by We Live Security
here.

The official release imagines a computer which could, ?scour the billions
of lines of code we depend on, find and fix the toughest flaws, upend the
economics of computer security, and level the playing field between
attackers and defenders.?

The agency said, ?The coming advent of the Internet of Things, data
insecurity is on track to become physical insecurity. The same code that
powers today?s networked computers ? code that is routinely compromised by
attackers ? is making its way into our vehicles, our smart homes, our
augmented reality, and our connected culture. This future requires
fundamentally new thinking about how networked devices will be defended.?

I have enjoyed Cinnamon too. But my laptop has AMD Radeon graphics which 
Mint for some reason could not work with (how I dream of a open 
computer). So I had to use Ubunutu. Guess what next, after some updates 
Unity broke and now am using Gnome which on top of Ubuntu fits not so good.

But in home I have a desktop (rarely used) that uses Mint and it runs so 
cool.

Mint is a built on top of ubuntu. Find it odd that Radeon does not
work on it if it does on ubuntu. Has nothing to do with desktop
environment just drivers. Amongst graphics cards, Radeon has the best
open source driver support. NVIDIA in comparison is lousy.

Check the latest Phoronix site for 65 GPU models  and open source drivers.

The network topology and intent must be clear. Assuming each of your
network cards is part of a different subnet, traffic for each of those
subnets will go to the appropriate interface. Normally all other
traffic would go out through one interface card/subnet which has the
gateway to the address space outside your subnets.

Do you have gateways on all the subnets? If you do, then just
configure multipath static default route via all the interfaces or
gateway addresses

For interface based:
ip route add default scope global nexthop dev eth0 nexthop dev eth1 ...

For gateway based:
ip route add default scope global nexthop via <gw-ip1> nexthop via <gw-ip2> ...

Thanks for the quick reply.
Let me be more clear. All the four network interfaces are in the same
subnet with different IPs and the same default gateway.

Can it be configured in such a way that the traffic gets distributed
between the network interfaces if one of them is busy ?

Thanks
Regards,
Krishna

You can configure by interfaces as I'd described earlier. Routing based on
device load is not possible. Packets get queued on the destined interface.
You could use equalise directive for packet equalisation instead of per
flow.

I guess what you require is interface bonding.  I believe that should help
you with this case.

+1. Yes. Did not think of that as the discussion was on routing.
Thanks for the correction. Bonding is a much cleaner and neater way in
this scenario.

If closed source driver is used desktop environment matters a lot. AMD
closed source driver is very buggy.

If anyone is interested in taking up this work, I am ready for pay for
them.  Kindly contact offlist for more details.

          Thought I don't have a solution right away, I vaguely
remember the LARTC explaining something very similar - Here is the

       I didn't quite catch that - Fluxbox in itself is a WM, and it
is an excellent one :) So,Did you mean to say Awesome works on top of
fluxbox as well ?

          Quite good. Unity is bloated and a light weight, nice WM is
definitely needed. Fluxbox is what I have been recommending :) I'll
try Awesome. Thanks

Link bonding can be done either in standby or load balancing mode.
Static ECMP routing with packet equalise will achieve this too if the
links are in different subnets (example command line was given
before). Given that all your cards are in the same subnet, link
bonding is the ideal solution.

I will not recommend LARTC unless you are understand QOS/queuing and
traffic control well along with what qdiscs to use (need to understand
the behaviour and appropriateness to your scenario). I think that is
an overkill. Simple packet based round robin balancing will achieve
what you want in the bonding scenario.

There is no concept of interface being busy but just queue length. If
an interface is busy, packets get dropped if the queue is full.
TCP/IP's internal mechanism will slow the source rate down
automatically.

Hmm...Even I am bit surprised that your Gx card is not supported by
Mint. *Usually*, what works on Ubuntu works on Mint but Mint has its
own driver manager (_fork of Ubuntu's Jockey i guess_) ..You never
know!

Have you tried Mint 17 yet?

Or you can run Cinnamon on top of Ubuntu although there is no official
package. Even stable ppa available offered by glebihan is being
discontinued. :-(

http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=167289 >> See here
for thread on Cinnamon stable PPA.

If you're adventurous, you could compile from git or run nightly
build. (I used to do that even on my regular machine ;-) )

Nope. Muddled mind and fast fingers :) You are right. Fluxbox is a WM.
I made a mistake in referring to it otherwise. You must try Awesome.
It lives up to its name.

+1 on the practical side of a SAN implementation but the OP needs to
learn the basics of storage SAN concepts first IMO.

I evaluated all of the above about 12 months ago and found FreeNAS to
be the most functional.  Openfiler appears to be a dead project and
OpenmediaVault was not as mature as FreeNAS.

Beware this is not a small topic.  This is the backend for storage in
all data centers.

I have found this IBM redbook a good reference material.
<http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg245470.pdf>

BTW, I had found this book with search key words "storage area
networks basics."  Also, there are other IBM Redbooks covering topics
like LDAP, Linux, etc.

@ Ravi Chandran - it is great to see your thirst for knowledge but I
would suggest that you do some homework on topics that interest you.
To me it appears, you heard about SAN and popped a question here.
IIRC, a while back you had asked about MySQL admin.  I don't want to
sound discouraging but I would suggest, you pick a couple of areas
that really interest [a] you and become competent at it.  You can
demonstrate your competency by helping others who are new to the field
in online mailing lists/forums and/or blogging your knowledge.

[a]  If you are good at something there will be jobs for you.

Earlier I was in digest mode and now I turned off the digest mode and
replying to this thread.

 I introduce myself T. Vigneswaran, completed my Diploma in Computer
Engineering in April 2014.

I'm interested in giving a talk/demo about GNU Mediagoblin ( A free
software media publishing platform as a decentralized alternative to
Flickr, Youtube and Soundcloud).

The demo would cover installation/configuration of GNU Mediagoblin using
Fedora 20 (Internet may be required during Installation).

Duration : 20 minutes

The speech would be in Tamil.

Subject: [Ilugc] simple tcp client and server
Message-ID: <CALDskyyapB-OiQeB+YG-gK0xAEOZ_PPpQSzLxFbmcWnnz-rPYQ@mail.gmail.com>

This is one of the beginner sockets code that anyone learns after he
learns basic syntax and looping.

Doing this was easiest in python, perl,lua.

But now you have node.js, the serverside javascript engine based on
Google's V8 virtual machine.

So here goes. I had to do this for a project.

I need a simple TCP server written in node.js like this:

        #!/usr/local/bin/node

        var sys = require('sys'); /* system calls */
        var exec = require('child_process').exec;

        // server
        require('net').createServer(function (socket) {
            console.log("connected");

            socket.on('data', function (data) {
                str = "date";
                console.log(str);
                exec(str);
                console.log(data.toString());
            });
        })

        .listen(2000);

Then the client:

 #!/usr/local/bin/node

        var s = require('net').Socket();
        s.connect(2000, '127.0.0.1');
        s.write('I got mail');
        s.end();

Simple sockets based communication between two machines on
the Internet.

Sockets coding continues to amuse me.

Unless, there are some unusual installation quirks that the audience
needs to understand, please avoid this and bring along a VirtualBox or
a KVM appliance with Mediagoblin already installed.

following areas:

1. Operating Systems
2. Networking
3. Programming
4. Virtualization/Cloud Computing

There will be a strong emphasis on using Free Software Tools to gain a
clear understanding of the topics covered in the course. While this is
primarily a technical course, Learning Skills/Communication Skills are
interwoven into the course modules and will be of help to the job seekers.

All the trainers are working IT Professionals with hands-on experience in
the respective areas of technology.

The course targets CS & IT graduates and MCAs who are looking for their
first job.

The venue is T Nagar and the class room sessions will be of 2 hour duration
- 2 or 3 times a week. Apart from the hours spent in the class room, the
trainees will be expected to put in significant amount of time on lab
exercises/reading tasks.

We may be in a position to let you try out the course for FREE for one
session without any obligation to pay/continue. This may help you to decide
if the course will benefit you.

Please mail me directly off list with your resume for more details about
the course.

He already done the setup in his laptop and he would be showing the
demo first.    Later he planned to remove the whole setup and do it
fresh, as GNU  MediaGoblin has lot of python dependencies which gets
downloaded during the installation, he was looking for internet
connectivity.  Now, he brings his dongle for internet connectivity.

As the speaker is not well verse in English, he decided to do in Tamil.

How come a complaint from a boy about his girlfriend marked as sexism? I
was expecting some B-word, W-word, C-word, F-word in that slide, but
nothing is there.

It is sexism because the person in question objectified* her by saying
that a software behaves like her (the context has sexual overtones as
it is between the two of them).

* In the colloquial sense, objectification is usually used with a
negative connotation. It often refers to the reduction of a complete,
whole person to a mere one-dimensional thing. One of the main
complaints about objectification is that it denies the humanity of the
"object."

Objectification leads to abusive behaviour.
If one really respects another person then they would not do that.

There is no best OS just as there is no one, favourite ice-cream. Each
one has their own likes and dislikes. Try out different OSes and
choose the one you like.

Great idea! Great programmers are never good at project management (i.e 
spreadsheeting, emailing, marketting and politics). Books like these may 
help them if they read it. Hope you capture geek market in a big way, 
though I feel that will be incredibly difficult for a soft skilled book 
compared to a book like "Ruby Under the Microscope" or "Haskell". Market 
well.

I wish there was a book named "Surviving Politics for Geeks".

Please tell us how is this problem related to FOSS.   Your best bet
would be to contact the SAN vendor and ask them to support their
product.

I am located in Mumbai -- same story.   I have seen certified
engineers not able to answer basic questions on RHEL/CentOS platform
they are certified for.    I tell candidates not to tout their
certifications 'cause it is worth the wrapper for peanuts.

The curriculum is global.  I have friends (experienced admins in
fairly large data centers) in other parts of the world; a few of them
had to repeat the exams.   Here, I see fresh graduates with
little/zero experience getting certified in their first attempt yet
many are unable to perform simple sysadmin tasks.   It makes one
wonder how is this possible.

Peruse a few of the LinkedIN LInux groups (e.g. LInux Expert), many of
them cannot articulate their queries properly.

Message-ID: <CAND27974qkAYqDk9m8=nLctgvZ5gLZ7HEaX3_oXzu=25Q-ZKYg@mail.gmail.com>

I have a GUI application to be run on a headless server, in cron
periodically.

It runs well on local laptop in cron  as I have logged in a GUI environment.

Ex-

10 10 *  * * display:0  firefox

I have to run the same application on a remote server where I have SSH
login as root.

The server has all the gnome and kde installed.

But the GUI app is not running as I did not logged in GUI.

I don't know if the ctrl+F7 area has only gdm login screen or someuser has
logged in already.

Is there any way to login as GUI user remotely even no one logged in GUI
locally ?

Thanks for your inputs.

Today, I got a puzzle.

Complete this 7 letter word:
_ T _ A _S_

Clue:
1. Girls love it.
2. Boys use it.
3. Parents hate it.
4. Animals are scared of it.

Shall we create a web application to solve these kind of puzzles?

Have to get the no of words and known letters .

We can compare with available dictionary words in English with regular
expression and list the suitable words.

We can extend this to tamil language too with a set of all available Tamil
words.

Can anyone do this as a open source project?

I don't think this is possible.   You *need* an X server to display.
Does your application work from CLI i.e. output on a console?

'root' ?  bad idea.   FF can run as any user, as root you have the
full authority to create a regular user!

Curious, where did the FF display come up?

Good.  The libs must be on the headless server.

It is 'CTL+ALT+Fn' to switch the VGA console of your headless system,
so how does this matter?

Provide a use case scenario for a better understanding of what you are
trying to do.

> Is there any way to login as GUI user remotely even no one logged in GUI
> locally ?

Yes but It is necessary to understand how X windows works.   In a X
desktop, the applications run as client and talk to it's X server over
a unix socket (in the early days, the X server also took connections
over the network but that is not the default setup.   With headless
setup i.e. no X server running, you are out of luck.  To me it does
not make sense to run firefox from a cron job to display on the same
headless server.

On a remote desktop, you can try:

(a) open up the X server to accept connections from the headless
server and program firefox at the headless server to display on this
desktop.   I leave the mechanics of this for your research.   Once
this works, accordingly modify your cron entry on the headless server.
Make sure there is another entry to kill this job, otherwise you will
have multiple displays

(b) ssh -X someuser at headlessserver  'firefox'.  This is an easier
option and also better IMO.

In the past, you have asked interesting questions.  However, IIRC
there has been no closure on them i.e. which of the suggested
solutions worked for you or not.

I would suggest that you please post your final solution so that
others benefit from such discussion.

You can try using virtual frame buffer. XVFB.

I often use XDMCP enabled via KDM in the remote server and connect
remotely via local X server using

X   :1   -query <remote server ip>

example as in

https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.2/Installation_Guide/s2-trouble-remotex.html

This would work, if there a VGA port on the remote server and it is
configured to start KDM.   There is additional complexity that the
display of *some* application on the remote server will be kicked off
via a 'cron' job.

The OP mentions remote server is headless but 'headless' is not fully
defined.   Does headless mean there is a VGA port but no display
attached *or* the system has only a serial console for management?

For the above method, minor clarification, it should read

For long, I have made it a point not to hire people with any 
certification. Why don't you people try to hire people attending lug's, 
people who participate in discussions here and other lugs. A person with 
interest in computers is far far better than a person who did 
certification for money.

I did find a person with Red Hat certification. He had installed RHEL
in his laptop. The laptop's trackpad was not working with RHEL and the
person did not have a clue on how to find the problematic component.
This is an example of the unfortunate situation people are today in.

What really matters is a person's experience and the desire to learn
new things. Without these no certification will help.

I have seen students with RedHat Certification who primarily use
*only* Windows in their personal laptops.

I tried this method to run xclock from a headless vm. It works. Here is
the steps I followed.

Steps:

1. create a headless(no video card and no X running) VM.
2. install xclock in that VM
3. enable ssh port forwarding in that VM
4. start sshd in that VM.
4. from my local machine tried connecting to VM with following command
	DISPLAY=":0" ssh -X 192.168.2.108 'xclock'

replacing xclock with firefox in the above steps will work. So, the cron
entry has to be in the local machine like this,

00 10 * * * DISPLAY=":0" ssh -X <remoteuser>@<headlesshost> 'firefox'

this will connect to the headless VM with X11 port forwarding enabled.
So, firefox will be shown in the local :0 display everyday at 10:00 AM

I have to say, XDMCP and X11 port forwarding are wonderful things, these
Wayland people are going to kill it anyway.

Thanks,
Mohan R

Wonderful, for putting the step by step instructions.
There is one step missing - for password less login, you need to
install ssh keys on the 'headless' server.
I am presuming you must have done that in your setup.

However, there is no follow up from  the OP.  It would be nice to know
whether any of the suggested solutions works for him.

XDMCP traffic is in clear; I use it only only on trusted networks like
my small office.  For the WAN, I use 'ssh -X ...'  for quick
connections and openVPN for wider access to client's networks.

Assuming these are linux servers, you can do VRRP for ip failover in a
master slave (active-standby) configuration. However, I suspect this
alone may not be enough. What is your application? Web based? Suspect
it is as you are talking of DNS. Can you drop sessions?

For web based applications, it would be better to use a load balancer
(like nginX) which will maintain sessions and will talk to servers
behind it configured in a active-standby configuration.

Subject: [Ilugc] how node.js is changing the landscape
Message-ID: <CALDskyxhx0M7VTN04AwAweL4BoQDWiyLB7q2Bat5UzaF2XJ-VQ@mail.gmail.com>

node.js is serverside javascripting.

In short whatever we used to do with C, perl, python and web CGI and
UNIX can now be done with the Google's V8 javascript VM otherwise
known as node.js.

Node.js is the most sought after skill in odesk though there may be
other things that people look for that are more popular.

There is a package management system called npm(node package manager)
that helps you install node.js plugins just like Perl CPAN modules.

Using node.js you can easily do complex things using UNIX as all this
javascript code runs using full rights on a server, not inside a
browser.

I entered this world only 8 months ago or so. But already I have
covered some ground though of course I need to spend another year to
get comfort.

But in general it is a great way to learn in some cases.

Javascript is a very complex and comprehensive language learnt only by
lot of effort and practice.

It is well worth it, once you learn it you can install spidermonkey
and learn with the js> interpreter.

And you can of course use the browser plugins like Chrome debugger or Firebug.

But these days I never use Firefox.

And once you learn javascript node.js can be mastered as it is only
javascript with some  packages thrown in.

Github is full of new node.js packages created each day.

Javascript is completely asynchronous, there is no concept of blocking
or sequential execution.

And node.js is no exception.

This means programming can sometimes be very difficult.

Subject: [Ilugc] python regex - question
Message-ID: <1403022427.9763.36.camel@host0.silentcrooks.org>

Hello Regex Gurus,

I need help handling this particular situation

In a log file, I have a line like this,

2014-06-17 13:55:14: IncomingData: TMSUpdateCallback:
{ SourceID=JP000456712 Ric=0388.HK BuyQty=3800.0 TradeTime="2014-06-17
13:54:19" DestID="" ExchangeTransCode="65725497 89897456 523 1"
Account="PTBHK01" }

I have to make a dictionary out of this line using the key=value pair
strings between {} parenthesis. I can take out the inner string using
the following code,

re.search('^.*{ (.*) }.*$', line).groups()[0]

But, after this, I'm looking for a way to split the string using '
'(space), but the values also contains ' '(space) in between. I have to
replace the space in the values and split the string using ' '(space).
Is there any way in regex to capture only the values which are inside ""
and contain space?

Thanks,
Mohan R

Your approach is wrong, use find() to start the splitting with '='.

I shall send you code soon. Hold on.

No regex needed.

replace the the string of spaces with *one* space and - something like
this "[ ]{1,+}"
You can also try sed to search for strings and capture the context in
a variable.

How are you? If this is related to office work, then you owe me! :)
Check whether this fits your req.

result = re.findall("\w+=.+?(?=\s+\w+=|\s+})",feedstr,re.M|re.I|re.X)

wow!! I never thought there is a direct regex solution. thank you very
much. Also, I fixed it today using space-to-underscore-inside-quotes
approach. here is the code,

[code]

#!/usr/bin/env python                                                                                                                                                   

import re

line = '{ SourceID=JP000456712 Ric=0388.HK BuyQty=3800.0 TradeTime="2014-06-17 13:54:19" DestID="" ExchangeTransCode="65725497 89897456 523 1" Account="PTBHK01" }'
line = re.match("^.*{ (.*) }.*$', line).groups()[0]
print dict([word.split('=') for word in re.sub('("(?:[^ "]+ *)+")', lambda x: x.groups()[0].replace(' ', '_'), data).split(' ')])

[/code]

This is not a straight forward regex solution, not sure this can be
achieved in other languages. Anyway thanks for all those replied and
took time to provide a solution.

Thanks,
Mohan R

Also worth deploying would be http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/ since
nginx only provides Layer-7 level fault tolerance / load balancing. This
way, you can have a more cleaner DNS setup (ie., one Virtual IP address for
your service being load balanced using LVS while there are multiple
physical machines). LVS would work for non-http applications too.

Also, if you're aiming to achieve awesome fault tolerance, you may want to
consider some sort of a GSLB (Global Server Load Balancing) so that if your
hosted site ("colo" or "data center") becomes unavailable, another hosted
site could take over.

Dear Friends,
With the end of the academic year, many of you will be shifting to
other {cites,states} for work/higher studies/etc. Having been a
strength to the movement in Karnataka, we would like to channel your
energy and support to democratic movements in other states as well.

As you may know, FSMK is a part of FSMI and we have several sister
organisations in other states and it would be a great help to the
movement if you continue your support even after moving there.  In the
case where there is no pre-existing movement then you will be the
people to help set up one.  FSMK was built with the help from friends
from all over the country and since we now have the strength it is our
duty to help others.

If you would like to volunteer, please fill the below form and we will
get in touch with you.

Boot from a live CD, do a choir to the directory on hard disk and execute
passwd root or the user name to change the password.  Well documented on
the internet.
http://www.c-integration.com/blog/showpost.php/83-reset-linux-root-password-without-knowing-the-password

I've not tried the grub and single mode in recent times as single user mode
was also password protected.

As a standard practice, I have my normal user id also in sudoers file so
that I can execute privileged commands when I need to. Can change passwords
if I do forget for some privileged account.

what search keywords did you use?  what links did you read that were

with keywords "recovering ubuntu password"  the links on the first

If you are still stuck, tell us at which step you are getting stuck.

We are a group that is willing to help those who help themselves. Please
use the same words in Google search,  read up what comes up and ask
specific questions. I'm sure you would see quite a few hands go up.

You might still get some responses now tontour mail as some folks are
magnanimous.

It is likely you are new to this list and have not been on lists for a long

Since single user mode is password protected, the easiest way is to
pass the kernel parameter 'init=/bin/bash' to the kernel.

This will drop to shell in read only mode.  Now, remount '/'
filesystem in 'rw' mode and run 'passwd' to change the password.

Thank you Girish,

It would be better if you had also included the learning path as well as
the amount of effort (time variant and a small project)

How easy is to do application with respect to to the other languages.

Hi Users,
I am trying to implement my application in my client place and the
application is developed in Ruby on Rails.

Since I am going to deploy on their premise I wish to make the code as
encrypted can be compiled but not be able to view, use or copy.


How can I do that using open-source tools.

Obfuscating source code with open source tools.   This flies in the
face of the open source philosophy.
IMO, wrong question, wrong forum.

Try coffeescript for nodejs programming.
In simple terms,  you can write a program in simple sytax (given by
coffeescript), which generates the nodejs code. Coffeescript also a nodejs
package.

i entered nodejs world just 4 months back. Its awesome. few lines of code
you can do plenty of jobs.

Thanks

*Express js*.
Start with express js. It is minimal and flexible node.js framework. It is
like Sinatra (Ruby), Flash(Python), Slim (PHP)
Link: http://expressjs.com/

*Geddy js*
Then try geddy js. It is structured mvc framework. Like Rails, Django,
CakePHP
Link: http://geddyjs.org/

Both website have good documentation. Easy to install and start with.

Consider reading this article in Full.

https://alteeve.ca/w/AN!Cluster_Tutorial_2

Remember you WILL need a shared (block device and NOT NAS) storage
like ISCSI/SAN.

You will also require some working and tested fencing mechanism (IPMI
or Power fencing).

Mind you DRBD is a Block level replicaion and I have used it many times.
It works quite will and you may not need external storage

This cluster will help you switch (active/Passive) over file systems
such as ext4, databases (mysql, oracle etc), Apache, Virtual IP,
samba, ctdb etc. etc. At least I have deployed it for all of these.

For load balancing of course you will need a third box

I am a Rubyist, one curse of learning Ruby is u'll never ever want to 
program in another language. Its possibly the only language on this 
planet that was made with programmers ease in mind.

I am a pro ROR dev. Its been very difficult for me to even consider 
programming with Javascript framework. Though its clear that frameworks 
like Meteorjs has better features than Ruby on Rails.  I hope we will 
soon have transcompilers like http://opal.rb that convert other 
languages to Javascript.

What I can't understand though is why none of browser vendors want to 
implement beautiful language like Python / Ruby into browsers?

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] How to convert all Project Madurai ebooks to 6 Inch
	PDF for Kindle?
Message-ID: <CAND2795C2Mcq_zWEd8YL9M7X0wpLO_yG9WFATCNLHgHDHN0uWg@mail.gmail.com>

http://ProjectMadurai.com has tons of old tamil literature as HTML and
A4 PDF files in public domain license.

There are many ebook reading devices and tables that dont support Tamil.
To use these devices, we can create 6 Inch PDF files with tamil content.

Let us see here, how to convert all Project Madurai ebooks into 6 Inch PDF files
using the utilities available in GNU/Linux.

1. Get the filenames.

http://www.projectmadurai.org/pmworks.html

This page has all the ebooks.

Copy the page content, paste in LibreOffice spreadsheet.
Copy the column named "unicode"

save the filenames only as a separate text file.

cat pm.txt

 pmuni0001.html
 pmuni0002.html
 pmuni0002.html
 pmuni0002.html
 pmuni0002.html
 ...




2. Download these files using wget and python script.


cat dl-wget.py

import urllib
import os
book = open("pm.txt").readlines()

for filename in book:
    filename = filename.strip()

    print "Downloading " + filename

    bookurl = "http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/utf8/" + filename

    command = "wget -E -H -k -K -p --max-redirect 0 --domains
www.projectmadurai.org -e robots=off " + bookurl

    os.system(command)




running the following command,


python dl-wget.py


will download all the html files with the relevant images to the current folder.

There are 593 html files downloaded.


3.
Convert to PDF

The utility wkhtmltopdf will convert any given html file to PDF file.

To convert to 6 inch PDF, the following command helps.

 wkhtmltopdf -s A6 --minimum-font-size 40 -B 5 -L 5 -R 5 -T 5
source.html destination.pdf



Now, let us convert all the downloaded html files to 6 Inch PDF file
using a small shell script.



for i in *.html; do orig=`basename $i .html`; echo "Converting $orig";
wkhtmltopdf -s A6 --minimum-font-size 40 -B 5 -L 5 -R 5 -T 5  $i.html
$orig-6-inch.pdf; done




By running this command, all the 593 html files are converted into 6
inch PDF files.

Now, we can read these 6 inch PDF files in Kindle, android mobile or tablets.

4. Upload the 6 inch PDF files.

I have uploaded all the 6 inch PDF files here.
http://bit.ly/project-madurai-kindle-books

Get the real name of the book by comparing here.
http://www.projectmadurai.org/pmworks.html

Download your favorite book and start reading.

Nice to see the conversion script , but have you used calibre ? It
will convert any file (supported formats) into mobi format which can
be read by kindle without loosing the flow. You can then increase the
font size as much as you like .

^ Having said that I am not sure if Indian languages are supported or
if appropriate fonts are in kindle. Last time I checked it wouldnt
work.

Kindle and many android devices (<= 4.2.x) dont show Tamil words good
in mobi or epub format.

6 inch pdf is the best solution to read tamil on those devices.

Making epub, mobi for advance devices is in the roadmap.

Hi Sheyam,

It would be better if you could ask this question at the Chennai.rb Mailing 
list. (or any Ruby Mailing List for that matter :) ).

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chennairb

Btw, to answer your question. There are couple of encoding tools to protect 
your source code. I wont mention them here.

Also if you could use JRuby then you get protection by default.. if you know 
what I mean.

Thanks
Steve

Message-ID: <53aba6e7.a9df440a.727a.74da@mx.google.com>

Hello people!

Surprise, surprise, surprise. What is better than 2? Definitely the
answer is 3!

We were extremely happy when we announced Kushal Das and Michael Foord
as our Keynote speakers for PyCon India 2014
(http://in.pycon.org/2014/ ). Now we are ecstatic to announce our 3rd
keynote speaker - none other than Jessica McKellar herself!

Jessica McKellar is an entrepreneur, software engineer, and open
source developer from San Francisco, California, USA. She is a
Director for the Python Software Foundation, PyCon North America's
Diversity Outreach Chair, and a maintainer for several open source
projects, including OpenHatch and the Twisted event-driven networking
engine. For her outreach efforts in the Python community, she was
awarded the O'Reilly Open Source Award in 2013.

This edition of PyCon India promises to be the best so far and is
absolutely going to be one that you don't want to miss. Not just in
terms of our 3 excellent keynote speakers, but in terms of the 143
talk proposals that we have as well. We wish we could give all of them
a chance, but unfortunately we only have 2 days of conference. Maybe
we should consider making it a 5 days conference next year huh? ;)

So jump in and vote for your favourite talks now!
(http://in.pycon.org/funnel/2014/ ) Oh, and better make sure you grab
the tickets (http://pyconindia2014.doattend.com/ )before they are sold
out as well.

Hope to see many of you there!

While this post mentions Linux too many times in the sense that
Android is built on top of Linux, this is still OT to this list as all
the stuff Google has introduced is proprietary without any open
standards or interoperability.

It would be not better or worst to ask in other forms as ilugc is no way 
less than other tech forums. Perhaps if one likes to do marketing for 
chennairb , one should find some other place (advertise in PC world may 
be). Plus chennairb is not democratic and really free, but is controlled 
by few admins who seems to be controlled by few companies. There have 
been incidence where people have been kicked out of chennairb, which 
totally goes against the norms of democratic group. I would rather 
recommend https://www.ruby-forum.com/  or official Rails channel 
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubyonrails-talk which seems to 
have no real commercial interest.

Ok, coming to the question. If you like to hide the source code, I would 
advise you to develop the app using Java, Scala, JRuby (as mentioned 
above). , though I can decompile Jar / War to get source easily. Why not 
develop it in ASP.Net as microsoft would love you to restrict your 
clients right to know what software he is using (well check that out in 
MSDN). To add to more, JRuby in practicality is near waste as its 
compatible only upto Ruby 1.9.3 . If you are very serious about using 
some gems, they might fail in JRuby.

So here is a way out:  Demand large enough money from your client so 
giving source to him may not be a problem. Or better use C++.

Cc:

In addition to the bug hug + testing days, I'd like to also schedule some
hackfests to get our tests in shape. What's a hackfest?

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Hackfest

We have some outstanding needs on both the automated and manual test
writing efforts. Elfy has already stepped forward to help out on the manual
test front (thank you much!), while perhaps still unbeknownst to the QA
folks, they'll be helping me on the automated test front :-) Thanks Leo et
la!

So what are we going to be hacking on? If you know python and have some
autopilot knowledge (or willing to learn), we are going to be hacking on
the toolkit helper for autopilot for the ubuntu sdk. That's a mouthful!
Specifically it's the helpers that we use for writing autopilot tests
against ubuntu-sdk applications. All app developers make use of these
helpers, and we need more of them to ensure we have good coverage for all
components developers use.

If you don't know python, we still need help writing manual testcases! All
you need is some basic tester knowledge and the ability to write in
English. Don't worry, we'll be around to help, and there's guides to well,
guide you! Specifically we'll be looking at writing and finishing some
testcases for ubuntu studio and some other flavors.

The first is scheduled for July 15th from 1900-2200 UTC. Complete details,
guides, work items, etc are all being collected on the event page:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Hackfest/20140715

Questions? Ask away! hope to see everyone there!

Hi Ravi,

Satellite is a premium product of Redhat.

But first understand why you need Sattelite, I suppose you know it.

If not please be noted, Satellite is a product to support large deployments
of Redhat Servers for package automation and installations, patches etc.

RHN will be in sync with Satellite server in a customer datacenter and all
servers inturn connect with Satellite.

hope this helps.
best
G

Since you haven't specifically mentioned the version etc. do have a
look at <https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Satellite/>
Hopefully, any additional queries will have listed solutions at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/knowledgebase>

Hello,

I want to purchase a Dell laptop with the configuration as i7- Intel core,
8 GB RAM as min specification. I am a regular Ubuntu user. I don't use
Windows and I don't want to buy Windows 8 along with that. Sadly, I
couldn't find an option like that along with the specified configuration.
Does any of you know any way to get it without Windows?

Dell has high end laptops with Ubuntu alone. Difficult to get without
Windows in India.

Recently Dell went private, and Microsoft is a major investor. I tried installing Linux on Dell Optiplex series and gave up after tearing my hair out. It is painful. 
Dell has discontinued Linux desktop offerings, so if you want a Linux desktop go to some other company brand or best assemble with Intel boards from the market. They are 25% cheaper and guaranteed to run Linux (all flavours) smoothly.

I use DELL laptops with Ubuntu and have been for over 12 years now. No
issue in running Ubuntu. The only situation where we get into issues
is with display drivers for GPUs like Radeon and NVIDIA. For Intel
graphics, it works like a charm.

I still see a few Laltitude laptops with Linux ubuntu option

@ Sreepriya,

Here is Dell Ubuntu Machine [1],  very near to your requirements, except
8GB RAM. But i do not think, that is challenge.

[1]
http://www.ebay.in/itm/like/dell-inspiron-3542-core-i7-4510u-4gb-500gb-15-6-2gb-graphics-ubuntu-dellexe-bag-/201087932322?pt=in_pc_laptops

I found around 51 SKUs with Ubuntu on Flipkart.com [2]

[2] http://www.flipkart.com/search?q=Ubuntu&as=off&as-show=on&otracker=start

There are lot of Dell Laptops certified with Ubuntu [3]

[3]
http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/make/Dell/?query=&category=Laptop&release=&level=Any

Now, you can find bunch of Dell / HP SKUs with pre-intalled Ubuntu in Croma
/ Reliance Digital World, just share your requirements, i am sure they will
find the same for you.

Personally, i think, those days are gone, Ubuntu is everywhere!!! I found
Ubuntu Cushion Cover on Flipkart [4] :)

Hope that helps...

I recently installed Linux Mint Debian Edition LMDE on my friends
machine which was running Windows 8 . The windows which came by
default came with lot of bloatware added to that it had caught cold (
joking ) . So I convinced my friend with a Live USB to use LMDE.

First thing I noticed was I was unable to boot from USB . I had to
disable UEFI boot and boot via legacy mode by hanging the bios
setttings. Oh yeah the secure boot was not turned on by dell , so I
left it alone. Next I was unable to access the Windows partitions. My
friend needed the data.  Though there are better ways to do things, I
just booted to windows and copied all the useful files to external
hard disk.

To install I found that the hard disk was formatted in GPT
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GUID_Partition_Table
I just used "gdisk" https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/gdisk  which is
available in the repo's to just convert the whole thing into MBR.
There were two hard disks one 500 GB and one 32 GB SSD. I gave SSD for
/ and swap while the /home was for 500 GB hard disk.
Note : conversion leads to complete loss of data.

Anyways my friend hardly cared about windows so its gone and gives me
a good feeling to install single boot :)

@sreepriya: Just buy some windows laptop and apply for a microsoft
refund as you have not accepted the EULA license, though its not as
simple as said , have a look at what Praveen has done
http://www.j4v4m4n.in/2014/06/24/microsoft-tax-refund/

^ Hope the others in LUG and some legal advisor?s help for getting the refund.

Hello everyone,

Thanks for all your replies. I still couldn't find a Dell laptop that
sticks to my needs and budgets. I need to do some memory profiling running
 VMs  and thus* processing speed and RAM size is crucial for my work*. (i7,
8GB).
I was looking for other options than Dell and found the *following model on
ASUS *interesting.

http://shopping.indiatimes.com/computers/notebook/asus-k55vm-sx086d-laptop-i7-8gb-1tb-15-6-inch-mocha-brown-/11389/p_B1433811

But I am not sure *how good is ASUS compared to Dell*. Are there someone
who had used it ? Is it good for project works related to memory analysis
and systems?

Also, are there *any other good models* that you would suggest for me with
Ubuntu as my default OS.

ASUS is the best when you compare it with DELL and HP. But some of ASUS
previous versions have a touchpad problem with Ubuntu. So check that out.
