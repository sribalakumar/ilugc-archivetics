Hello Ubuntu GNOME Team,

As per our monthly meeting [1], I have proposed many ideas and kind of
roadmap for the near future of Ubuntu GNOME. The ideas/suggestions which
apply to the topic of this email were:


   - Recruit more members and mostly testers [2]
   - Once we have enough number to form a sub-team or group, we start to
   create one for each area.


I was trying to keep this until we release 13.10 but with unexpected amount
of MANY NEW Members Joining Us and Offering their full help and support as
an answer to the call of help [3][4], I find it difficult to wait :)

Today, I'd like to announce that Ubuntu GNOME has a Sub-Team for Testing
(QA/Quality) with initial of less than 10 members but I am sure we will
reach around 15-20 even before releasing 13.10 (hopefully).

https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugnome-qa

The Sub-Teams Experience of Lubuntu [5] was and still successful and this
experience inspired me and I do hope this will be so helpful for Ubuntu
GNOME and Ubuntu Quality in general.

*Dear members of Ubuntu GNOME Team* who are interested about the Testing
Area [6] and those who have showed a great passion and helped a lot to
report bugs, send feedback and shared their findings, etc and helped to
have a real stable release even though we didn't yet release the final
version but Ubuntu GNOME Saucy is doing so great. Please, send a request to
join:

*https://launchpad.net/~ubuntugnome-qa*


@Ubuntu Quality Members
If you are willing to help us and support us, please join Ubuntu GNOME QA
Team and we will be very glad to get extra hands :)

Thank you everyone!

Time to have fun :)

Hi,

Just figured out that the skype package is available in the partner
repository

deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu raring partner
deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu raring partner

Once the lines in /etc/apt/sources.list are uncommented and apt-get update;
apt-get upgrade followed by a apt-get install skype should get it installed
for
you.

Please use proper English word and avoid SMS abbreviations.  Also
avoid giving phone numbers in public mailing lists.

Kerberos+LDAP is the foundation for MS Active Directory, by far the
most widely deployed Directory Service.
Why do you think there are disadvantages with Kerberos - can you point
to some references?

Nice show case for Libre software.   Here is another one -- City of
Munich, Germany
<http://www.itworld.com/operating-systems/321474/switching-linux-saves-munich-over-11-million>

There are such show cases in India as well but not publicized other
folks could add their own here.
e.g. LIC, Mahararashtra State Transport Corp.

Supreme Court and District courts are also using Ubuntu and Libre Office.
But I have not seen any educational institute or any University in Northern
India which is following FOSS strategy and implementing FOSS in their
enterprise.

Snippet from LinuxCon video which I shared last time:
*" A university professor from Czech-Republic made all their students get a
patch merge into the kernel. That was one of their assignments. We got
about 20 different patches and about 5 of them said that this is really
easy. It was not hard at all. Thank you very much for letting me get a good
grade and I am gonna keep doing it. That was great. That Prof. did a
wonderful job."**- Greg Kroah-Hartman*

Wondering, is it possible in Indian education system?

I would like to request you to explain a bit more about what you mean
by "FOSS strategy". What is your expectation from such a strategy and
its implementation?

You can see this happening already. There are a significant number of
KDE, GNOME contributors who are students and, are building features,
fixing bugs in the applications.

TANGEDCO (Tamilnadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited) has
been using customized version of GNU/Linux in 3000+ collection centres
across Tamilnadu since 2006.  TNEB (Tamilnadu Electricity Board) is one of
the early adopter of GNU/Linux, since 2001.

Sir, by FOSS strategy I mean to say following and implementation FOSS
Technology for their enterprise and for educating students. This will let
students understand and experience something NEW and they can be
innovative. Mostly students (even university students) are not familiar
with Open Source culture (what I've seen so far).

Yes, I agree there are plenty of students and professionals who are
contributing to Open Source projects but the ratio is very less in numbers.
But my context was to implement this in schools, colleges and universities
so that they can start from an early stage. Correct me if I am wrong.

That's a very big positive mindset and all country men want this to be implemented?

If I could do such development work in school / colleges I would be destined to have a much better future here rather working for some maintenance work for clients.

After 12+ years of my service - if I ask what did I learned - the answer is their product, technically nothing. Cause I did not set my mind to develop product from scratch, nor a chance.

Unfortunately interviews are like you have to design compilers - so they ask DS, Algo etc .. but when we are selected the work is like a pure service orientation.

So who will change the system - ME. People should come out and put forward their vision.

Everyone here should take up responsibility to go to schools & colleges and? regularly conduct classes.

Regards,
Prakash

students understand and experience something NEW and they can be
innovative. Mostly students (even university students) are not familiar
with Open Source culture (what I've seen so far).

Yes, I agree there are plenty of students and professionals who are
contributing to Open Source projects but the ratio is very less in numbers.
But my context was to implement this in schools, colleges and universities
so that they can start from an early stage. Correct me if I am wrong.

I completely agree with the above statements, and that is the only way to
bring the F/OSS culture in the Indian education system.

Well said.  We all can take responsibility, go to Schools, Colleges and
Universities and conduct the classes (Seminar/Workshop/FDP) and even
completely dedicate ourselves for a social cause.  But, we all have to do
this in our own capacity and we will not be allowed to post such events in
this list, as this would be annoying for some users.

So,

* have vision
* take responsibility
* change things
** do not announce them in this list **

Sorry for trolling.

All my current / future F/OSS events (Seminar / Workshop / FDP) will be
announced through

Well I do not agree with your view point. Firstly nothing is extreme right or extreme wrong and finding a win-win situation is always not possible.

We request you to go to school / colleges of your choice and conduct seminars - why worry of others - if their curriculum does not allows that create a blog, you will find interested people reading it - yes that should content simple and in-depth ?

Prakash

\quote

Currently, registrants store registration records, and anyone can go
to a number of sites  that use the WHOIS query and response protocol
to retrieve all the public information. The working group agrees with
critics that the system in use today provides too much inaccurate
information, and fails to protect the privacy of individuals and
entities with a legitimate right to keep the information out of the
public domain.

Critics of the working group's proposal agree that the system is
broken, but disagree with the recommendation that the openness of
today be replaced with a system that is closed by default. Under the
proposed system, individuals or entities that want registration would
have to apply to a central authority for "access credentials to the
ARDS."

And, <http://student.yourstory.in/2013/10/how-the-student-community-in-west-bengal-is-fostering-the-growth-of-startups-and-open-source-culture/>
My point being that you don't need to wait for the curricula to change
to bring about awareness and participation. Catch hold of Kushal
sometime and you'll realize what it takes (hint: it takes an
incredibly large number of sleepless nights!)

India ranks 2nd in code contribution to Linux kernel. Even though
students are not exposed to open source many Indians (at least as a
part of their daily job) contribute code. There is huge scope for
improvement but the situation is not worse I feel.

In the last weekend, Tamil wikipedia 10th year anniversary meet,
we felt that we need to increase the awareness of Tamil99 typing
to make more people type in Tamil easily.

Is it possible to create some online games for learning and practising
Tamil typing in Tamil99 layout?

Example:
http://www.freetypinggame.net/play17.asp
http://play.typeracer.com/

Like this we need for Tamil.

Anyone interested in this project?

Developing exercises similar to how gtypist has for various keyboard

Not to undermining anyone's effort , this is an Utopian dream come true ,
now i am seriously interested in this kind of enterprise to run in other
parts of the world , would you share those details as to how you guys do
the balancing act in terms of running the show , making money and doing
social good.

why i am asking is since its not possible to sustain this kind of effort
for such a long time the immediate costs which come to my mind are

1) Electricity.
2) Computers.
3) Internet.
4) Making and running the website.
5) Place.
6) Humans.

Dear all

I inaugurated the Linux Users Group at Kumaraguru College of
Technology, Coimbatore on 4th Oct. This was followed by a two day
workshop on 4th and 5th Oct 2013. About 60 participants from 2 and 3rd
year CSE students. The workshop was done by me and Mr.Baskar Selvaraj.

The college had somewhat active lug few years back and then went
dormant. At present there is an enthusiastic set of Faculty members
who are trying to revive it.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank the management and Faculty members for the
opportunity.

Greetings HW enthusiasts,

The motherboard of one of my system is RIP.    When I took out the CPU
heatsink+fan, it came out with the CPU firmly stuck to the copper!.

I have tried to separate the CPU from the heat sink without much
success.  I am afraid if I try any solution it might damage the CPU.

Any suggestion to resolve this 'sticky' issue would be much appreciated.

This 318 page eBook provides readers with the background and
instruction to design and build custom Linux systems. This eBook
highlights the Linux from Scratch project and the benefits of using
this system. Users can dictate all aspects of their system, including
directory layout, script setup, and security. The resulting system
will be compiled completely from the source code, and the user will be
able to specify where, why, and how programs are installed. This eBook
allows readers to fully customize Linux systems to their own needs and
allows users more control over their system.

Subject: [Ilugc] Mentorship requested for Linux Filesystem Project
Message-ID: <CAK25hWO6WEC0aHPyAnNVx-OCOT3n9CEufx+wtO8D9nGAXbQ_bA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I think many of you are aware of M.Sc-FOSS degree program from Anna
University.

I am one of the student and now I am in the final semester (project sem). In
this semester I need to do a project in any open source technology and I
have chosen a Linux filesystem project. I have been working over Union
Filesystem for quite some time and details of my work can be found at my
github account project page-
https://github.com/disdi/hepunion

In order to take this topic as an academic project, I need to have a
co-guide expert in this domain according to the University Norms. I kindly
request guidance from the community and request mentorship(co-guide) for
the same. I seek an expert in Linux filesystem design to volunteer as my
co-guide.

Regards,
Saket Sinha

Have you tried AuFS (an alternative version of UnionFS) ?

Just curious to know, whether hepunion project is ported to 3.8 kernel.

>>Have you tried AuFS (an alternative version of UnionFS) ?
Aufs does not exactly meet our requirement. That is why we decided to
implement our own filesystem.

 This filesystem is a CERN project which would run on LHCb where fast
diskless booting of various nodes are required so it uses just one Read
Only filesystem and one Read Write filesystem.

>>Just curious to know, whether hepunion project is ported to 3.8 kernel.
>>https://github.com/HeisSpiter/hepunion
I only ported Hepunion to 3.8 kernel as a part of GSOC project. You can
find my commits in the main repository. At CERN they are using SCL5 which
uses 2.6.18 kernel so this driver was originally written on 2.6.18.

This driver is still unstable and incomplete so I want to extend it as an
academic project and seek mentorship for the same.

Saket Sinha

Looks like AMD has been intentionally implementing checks in its catalyst

others.

More reasons to use FOSS drivers.

check if your .so files has all required dependency linked properly:

ldd? /expertus/Test/apache2/modules/mod_ssl.so

If it states some dependency issues - your shared lib was not properly build.

root at prakashashi-desktop:/lib# ldd libproc-3.2.8.so 
??? linux-gate.so.1 =>? (0xb76e2000)

Thanks for everyone's interest in learning about 'LFS'.   As Mr. Raman
suggested, we will do it in multiple sessions in the forthcoming ILUG-C
meet (from December onwards).

To: mailinglist at fsftn.org


Dear all ,

FSFTN conducted a day long workshop on GIMP, Skills of Poster Making and
Basics of Inkscape at its office in T.Nagar. The session was attended by 12
participants, students and few IT professionals. The workshop was divided
into three sessions.

The first session dealt with the basics of GIMP and was taken by Harini, a
member of CEGLUG. This session gave the participants an introduction to the
various tools in GIMP and their usage and the concept of layers in GIMP.
Live demonstration of how to employ these tools and concepts was very
helpful for the participants to grasp the ideas presented by the speaker.

In the second session, Deepak Johnson from FSFTN gave some insights on the
Art of Poster Making by taking examples of posters desgined by the FSFTN
team from previous events and pages. Various tools in GIMP like Paths Tool
and the usage of Layers in GIMP for poster making were highlighted.
Intricate details of poster making like choosing the right color or
choosing the right font were also explained in this session.

The third and final session dealt with basics of Inkscape, a  SVG graphics
editor.  The session was taken by Yogesh Girikumar of FSFTN. The speaker
covered the various tools and their usage. The importance and usage of
Beizer Curves was demonstrated in the session. Participants were given
various tasks through which they could relate how to use the tools they had
learned.

At the end of the programme, a FB group - FSFTN-Creative
Group<https://www.facebook.com/groups/151957421680739>was formed to
encourage further activity on these lines.  With aim of
contributing  to Tamil wikipedia community,  a  svg
file<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%E0%AE%87%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4_%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%A3%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B3%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D_%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%B5%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B5%E0%AF%82%E0%AE%9F%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D_%E0%AE%85%E0%AE%B4%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D.svg>

Hi,

Thanks for the response. When I try to access the share from a domain PC it
asks for username and password.And its not accepting domain username and
password.

A mention of the Client OS + version would have been helpful to use to
help you!   If the client OS is Linux then use NFS as an alternative
way to share files.

To the best of my knowledge Samba 3 can do only NT4 Domain Controller
and *not* ADS (Windows 2000 onwards).

Consider Samba 4 for MS ADS style domain controller.

>     realm = wins.local

Consider using a real DNS domain name and create a subdomain for
intranet use e.g. intra.example.com.    TLD .local is reserved for
multicast DNS (avahi on Linux).

Samba4 does MS ADS quite well and there are many YouTube video
tutorials.  It is almost install and play.

Yet to get speakers.

This weekend seems long weekend due to festival season.

Some friends ask for postponing to next week Saturday.

Shall we postpone?

Share your thoughts.

Hi


>>Some friends ask for postponing to next week Saturday.

I proposed to give a session on "intro to ruby on rails".

I feel it is better to postpone the session to next week.
I guess this will facilitate more crowd to participate.

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

My entire knowledge of the "GNU" "Linux" System is thanks to LFS. It is
brilliant and is a must for any serious enthusiast. But the steep curve of
LFS is not worth for any casual user or traditional programmer. For the
people who are interested, do not miss this opportunity.

What makes this really exciting:

   - Compile every single package from source.
   - Bootstrap glibc and gcc to compile itself to use for compiling other
   sources!
   - Setup the linux file system from scratch.
   - Compile even grub and install it in the MBR.

But I am not sure that the entire process can be covered in one session of
the meeting and targeting the next session 1 month later might be too long.
My suggestion would be to demonstrate and hand hold the initial process of
chroot'ing and setup of the environment required. The rest can be left as
an exercise and the mailing list is always there to ask questions.

Message-ID: <CA+3=757s1S7EB30ZGT6QQ8uy+rxz3BH51TrhLFLZJRWWNU7WGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

My friend is working in an Organization and is managing close to around
1000 desktops (Windows) and some 40 servers (mix of UNIX, Solaris and
Windows).

He asked me to let me know if there is any equivalent of Kaseya for
managing his desktops especially.

With Kaseya, they are performing the following things: (all the below
mentioned things are being performed by Kaseya right now)

1. Help Desk & Ticketing System
2. Remote Installations
3. Patch Management
4. Base Level Auditing of Hardware, Software, Network
5. Auto Pilot Management
6. Remote Password Reset
7. VPN Support for clients
8. Disk Utilisation of the Clients
9. Network Utilisation

All the above mentioned things, he is getting alerts through mail as well
as SMS.

He asked me if there is any software which is going to give the above
things in Open Source.

I looked at iTOP & OTRS ITSM

http://www.combodo.com/-Features-.html &

http://www.otrs.com/en/software/otrs-itsm/features/

But not all the features are available and would like to know from others
who might be using different software which is identical or better than
Kaseya.

Waiting for your inputs

Pls. forgive me if it is top-posting or something else.

I always liked Srinivasan's openness to give out / share his knowledge, and
when he is willing to give / teach / train etc, fully, let us (atleast me)
take his full share (that would give more satisfaction to him, as we always
get the feeling - I am a sales person selling ABB products).

In a nut shell - let him decide the hours and the agenda - staggered or one
full shot - and like as any shishya, we will leave this to the guru.

If my point is wrong partially / fully - please forgive me.

I too am interested in knowing this LFS.

Thanks for this opportunity Srini,

with warm regards

https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator The last commit is 19 days ago. I don't

Ah ok. I read on a blog post that it is no longer maintained -

2. To find out the executable for a specific command is available

    $ whereis -b ls

    ls: /bin/ls

3. To search only for manual sections

    $ whereis -m ls

    ls: /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz

4. To locate source of Linux command

    $ whereis -s ps

5. To locate unusual entries using -u option

    $ whereis -m -u lsgrep

    lsgrep:

    it checks the command lsgrep source, binary and man pages

I see vim help on tags shows:

 :set tags=./tags,tags,/home/user/commontags
In this example the tag will first be searched for in the file "tags" in the
directory where the current file is.  Next the "tags" file in the current
directory.  If it is not found there, then the file "/home/user/commontags"
will be searched for the tag.

Does this seem to help your case ?

Blog posts are not sacrosanct nor are all the wikis.   The first place
to check is the software's web site + your Linux distro (if it
provides a native package).

0. I don't think RHEL 5.6 has any active support (for CentOS 5.6 I
know this is true) [a].
1. I would suggest upgrade to 5.9, if you have RHN then this is
definitely your legit right.  Otherwise switch to CentOS 5.9.
2. To the best of my knowledge the native apache RPM for RHEL/CentOS
does support openssl.  I have deployed a few web sites on CentOS and I
did not have to build from source to get openssl support.

Any particular reason why you are building from source?

Greetings All,

I have few questions. Please share your experiences.

* Is it mandatory for a job seeker to be proficient or aware from both
flavors "Debian and Redhat" (apt-get and yum) or one flavor is sufficient
to land up a job?

* If one is sufficient then which one gets the preference (debian or
Redhat)?

* Does any linux certification play an important role in your job hunting
journey?

* If any candidate doesn't have any certification but (s)he is good in *nix
and its concepts (good means "almost" familiar with *nix internals) then
what are the chances?

* Also share that if you're a looking for a Linux System Engineer then
which skills (Professional OR Personal) you want in a candidate?

I hope my questions will help newcomers and job seekers for sure in anyway.
And please ignore my stupidity in any of the above raised questions or
grammatically if found.

Thank you.

+ Generally I feel that attaining master in one OS is good enough - i.e. knowing *inx internals would be same for all platforms.

I want to add one more question:

I want to make my career in some research and development company (aiding students, industries etc) in Linux Device drivers / embedded systems - are there some companies of these profile?

Please? What do you mean by that anyway?

Just a search for "Hadoop Source Code" in Duck Duck Go, turned me the first
result as this https://hadoop.apache.org/version_control.html

Please do a online search, seriously.

I think that depend on the experience level of the candidate and job
requirements. 

By System Engineer, do you mean System Administrator?

For a free lancer /consultant, the more distros you know the better,
it is definitely an edge over anyone who knows only *one* distribution
by means of a certification.   Also, do not ignore Novell SUSE (the CE
being openSUSE).   openSUSE is also RPM based but zypper is the
frontend akin to yum or aptitude.

> * If one is sufficient then which one gets the preference (debian or
> Redhat)?

Please see above.   It depends on the organization + hiring manager.
I look for breadth + some depth in each.  I have come across certified
blokes who were not aware of CentOS!

> * Does any linux certification play an important role in your job hunting
> journey?

Perhaps at the HR door step.   Certification is a **validation** that
you are competent in a specific product.    It should be pursued when
you have sufficient domain knowledge in that product.   Unfortunately,
most join institutes right after finishing college, join boot camps
and pass the cert. exam.  Most do not bother to keep their skill
current by practicing what they learnt.   Consequently, at job
interviews they come across as incompetent (at least most that I have
come across).

As a hiring manager, I don't care if the candidate got 100% pass rate
in the cert. exam.   I quiz them on how fast they can think on their
feet and arrive at a reasonable solution.

Extremely good, although it is hard to come across such individuals.
 For the past couple of years my model has been -- select a few
candidate who know little about the system but demonstrate a huge
potential (i.e. a quick learner) and start from scratch; this way I
don't have to deal with any baggage the candidate brings with him/her.
   On the experience side, successful project deployments, backed up
with references, is more important than a string of alphabets (certs)
after the name.

> * Also share that if you're a looking for a Linux System Engineer then

Not sure what you mean by skill "professional or personal"   IMO, the
candidate must have both.   I would choose someone who knows quite a
bit but also knows how to share his/her knowledge and nurture junior
team members.

HI ,


Already that server(Live Server) was configured on RHEL 5.6, but old
versions of Apache, mysql, php. We want to be configure latest version of
Apache, PHP, MYsql with DRupal, without changing the repository. In  the
old version of apache, php & openssl, some vulnerabilities is there. Thats
why we have to migrate with latest versions.


Regards
GK

Perhaps you should have a look here:
http://iuscommunity.org/pages/Repos.html

In systems which have package management, it is best to use those
tools - like yum in RH or apt-* in Debian and derivatiives.

I did not check about drupal

Thanks for the link. But I wonder why the subject of the email has
something different. The issue is largely based on gender inequailty and
harassment, but your subject tells what? Sexual harassment == Ruby
development/ community? Great!

Greetings, tshrinivasan,
A Discussion has been created in group Chennai Drupal Community: Drupal
Camp Dharamshala 2013

DrupalCamp finally come to the Himalayas. The first ever camp is being
organised on the 19th October at Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh.

The event is being organised to spread awareness about Open Source
technologies and Drupal in particular. There will be couple of introductory
sessions in first half which will be followed by quiz competition and
community mixer.

In the evening we have planned an overnight Drupal.org code contribution
session. If some of the participants are upto it, then 20th could be well
spent trekking to Triund.

It is a great opportunity for nature loving techies to meet community
members and contribute actively in promoting Drupal amongst the local
community in Dharamshala. Who knows, maybe the next set of core
contributors come from this town.

For more information visit us on
http://drupalcampdharamshala.**org/<http://drupalcampdharamshala.org/>

What ? Are you serious? CONCERNS A RUBY DEVELOPER? WHAT? The issue is
SEXUAL ASSAULT! on WOMAN. And this exists in all communities and
conferences. But your motive looks different, you just want to write off
this as an issue isolated to single community?

the incident happened at a related conference.

No, http://codemash.org/ is a a polyglot conference which involves mainly
.NET, JAVA devs.

Subject: [Ilugc] [[Linux]] Few Technical Questions
Message-ID: <CAP6xenkUb1P92NODfzHWFq+AEtEryryqRuY2wLxW_mbQkDgvPA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings All,

I have few technical questions on which I need views. So kindly share your
views. And I have answered which I know. Please correct me if my answers
are wrong.

1. Which of the following 2 options is efficient and why?
a. tail -c 100 /tmp/test
b. cat /tmp/test | tail -c 100

Answer 1: Option (a) is efficient because it prints the last '100' bytes
from the file whereas option (b) firstly concatenate the file and then
parse it to last '100' bytes so option (a) is efficient.
Technically speaking: there's one fork in option (a) which requires no IPC
but in option (b) there are two forks and requires IPC.

2. Describe what the following command pipeline tries to do:
nc -l 10000 < /tmp/fifo | tee client_request | nc google.com 80 | tee
server_response > /tmp/fifo and how should /tmp/fifo be created (give the
command) for this to work as expected?

3. You freezed your laptop by closing its lid with out exiting your ssh.
now when you open it again, how do you exit the ssh (closing the pty or
killing is not elegant).

Answer 3: As far as I know, in both cases (if keys are saved or not), we
have to 'logout' the session manually. SSH-connection terminates if we move
one system from the location for some period (because next time we'll get
the IP from dhcp that can create confusions).

4. You only have 10mb disk space left, but still truncate -s 1g /tmp/file
succeeds and the file size shows 1gb post creation. explain how and why ?


Thank you.

Yes. tmux (older version) is available in packages for 12.04. You can add
a PPA if you want newest version (1.8).

tmuxinator is a gem so that works on any machine where ruby is installed.

For chef, this [1] tutorial helped me a lot.

This [2] video was helpful but I think it is not complete.

I would suggest you to use chef-solo and learn the basics before digging
deep.

If this is happening at boot time then /etc/fstab might give you some clue.

You are missing ruby developer packages. Use RVM (
https://rvm.io/rvm/install) to install Ruby 1.9.3 (or newer) and then
install tmuxinator.

I can't speak from market or hiring perspective but as a system
administrator myself, I find it handy that I have worked with various
types of Linux distributions.
But, what's more important is you understand what's going on under the
hood. In the end these all run Linux kernel with GNU userland
utilities and many more applications, as per your needs.

I believe a lot more companies would be using Redhat due to commercial
support from the vendor and popularity of it's certification. But, I
don't have any concrete data to support it. I have worked at places
where I have used both on the server end.

I don't have any certification or formal qualification but that hasn't
stopped me from getting any of the jobs or projects. YMMV.

This may due to some error on filesystem.

Backup all data and recreate filesystem using mkfs utilities.

OK, imagine your root partition is hda2

then try:

mount -o remount,rw /dev/hda2 /

this might help to resolve the issue.

The above is not a good idea.  Sometimes the problem may be caused due to
insufficient space in the / filesystem.  First check for free space using
'df -h' and if possible try tune2fs to regain the 5% reserved space used by
the filesystem and reboot it to see if there is space in the filesystem.

tune2fs -m 0 /dev/<partition>

Hi Anbu,

If you have installed the setup with a name say for example "example1" in
the server root folder ( mostly "/var/www/" in linux systems), it should
work when you call the url in the browser like,

http://localhost/example1/

In php, there is no need to explicitly start server each time when you do
the changes at the code level. Just refreshing the page in the browser
should work.

You don't need to explicitly start the framework. Just put it inside
apache's htdocs directory and navigate to http://localhost/appname.

It looks like a Harddisk issue. Check if you have 'Journal has aborted'
line in /var/log/messages or 'dmesg' output. If you look at the lines
above  "Journal has aborted" line, they can tell you what happened and
why read-only remount occurred.

Also, Use any SMART utility to see if you have Status=Fail on
'raw-read-error-rate', 'seek-error-rate', 'reallocated-sector-count'
attributes.

Thanks,
Mohan R

Microsoft, as an enterprise has a vast list of software released by them.
Hence specify the list of software (or atleast a group or a subset or an
application) so that we can list their equivalents.

Does your /etc/fstab have options to mount the partition in ro mode if
there are errors in the file system?  If so, it is likely that
partition was mounted in ro mode because of file system errors.   Boot
with a Live CD and run fsck on the concerned partitions.

Also run badblocks on the hard disks hosting the partitions.

Good work and nothing wrong with this approach.

However, it increases your admin maintenance.   Suppose there is a new
release that fixes some serious flaw(s), you will have to go through
the exercise of compiling from the new source v/s installing the RPM
package from the official repo.

Come out of MS Office. All things will become compatible!!!

Try Libre Office, an open source equivalent for MS Office, for your Writer
(Word), Spread sheet / Calc (Excel) and Presentations (Power point)
- Cross platform
- Good compatibility with MS Office.

MS Office Publisher : Scribus
(Not sure of compatibility)

MS access: Libre Base
(Not sure of compatibility)

All the above are platform independent. Hence,  I feel that I need not list
down the OS distributions.

Again, in some cases,you may not be able to switch over all the machines to
another OS.


I am not recommending to continue with the present OS you have. But I am
recommending to use cross platform applications for easiness and
compatibility.

Change the applications!!!
Don't care for the Operating System.

If we treat every package as a software which we should the list is long ,
from users perspective we may compare between the two ecosystems but we
cannot do justice to either since the users and applications where these
operating systems are put to use vary , ultimately it comes down to choice
in FOSS world we have many software for doing the same or similar work with
this comes the conundrum of choice.

just to give you an idea of the complexity here is the list of number of
packages
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions#Package_management_and_installation

if you  are trying to  look up for  alternatives you can start with
http://www.osalt.com/ , there are many other similar sites can you can do
some digging on web and report back.

Message-ID: <CAND2795ZV60st5w2=exBxjJPgCZ1dat+aooOgZgN8Z3gncc3-Q@mail.gmail.com>

This book will take you through everything you need to know to develop
UI applications. You will learn about installing/building PySide in
various major operating systems as well as the basics of GUI
programming. The book will then move on to discuss event management,
signals and slots, and the widgets and dialogs available with PySide.
Database interaction and manipulation is also covered. In a nutshell,
this book is great for learning how to program applications with GUI
and for mastering how to develop your own applications and how to run
them across platforms.

Topic:
Introduction to Ruby on Rails

Description:

Ruby on Rails, often simply Rails, is an open source web application
framework
which runs on the Ruby programming language. It is a full-stack framework:
it allows creating pages and applications that gather information from
the web server, talk to or query the database, and render templates
out of the box. As a result, Rails features a routing system that is
independent of the web server.

Ruby on Rails emphasizes the use of well-known software engineering
patterns
and principles, such as active record pattern, convention over
configuration
(CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and model?view?controller (MVC).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails
http://rubyonrails.org/

Duration:  45 mins to 1 hour

Prerequisite: Knowledge on HTML, a bit of Javascript and CSS.

For Hands-on, install Ruby On Rails in your laptops and bring.

Message-ID: <CAND2795H06-KQ6EDaYtsXngjrY_o_YGxLdK3aW7MNyU4qfyg0w@mail.gmail.com>

I was exploring Fantastico -  a web application comes with cpanel, used on
web hosting servers.

It lists the popular PHP based web applications and gives a one click
install facility.

It just asks for the location to install, admin username and password.
Then, it installs the web application.

It will be nice to build a similar command line application in python or
ruby to install famous web applications in localhost.

This will be very useful for anyone to explore any web application,
without  getting into the troubles of installing.

Is there anyone interested in doing this ?

Or is there anything like this available already?

Share your thoughts.

Hi All,

A lot of fixes made and a new feature is added to dhvani recently.

Changes made by Mohan:
1. Gstreamer backend to play pcm audio is added.
2. Fix: Instead of speech dhvani gave noise as output.

Myself:
Fixed a few memory leaks, removed unused code.

Please find the original message to dhvani-devel mailing list below.

PrasannaKumar

To: dhvani-devel at lists.sourceforge.net


Hi All,

One of dhavni's contributor Mohan has made important fixes and added
gstreamer backed support for playing pcm data. This prevents dhvani
form opening audio device or taking full control of audio device which
is a great benefit for desktop systems. If gstreamer is not detected,
older method is used so there should not be any issues. Also a lot of
memory leak fixes and removal of unused code are done.

The above changes should improve dhvani's stability a lot. It is
recommended to use the latest code (available at
https://github.com/tshrinivasan/dhvani-tts).

PrasannaKumar

Thanks to many all with helpful suggestions.   The common thread was
to use Isopropyl alcohol.

The following link <
http://www.wikihow.com/Remove-a-Processor-Fused-to-a-Heatsink>
suggested the isopropyl alcohol + heat gun method.

I tried the heat gun method first with care it did not work.

Then I switched to the alcohol method.  I kept  the CPU + headsink
submerged in "clinical spirit" (mostly isopropyl alcohol) for close to
16 hours.  I was hoping this would loosen the paste using the dental
floss method but no success!  The paste had spread to all the edges +
corner and I am not getting any gap to stick the floss in it.

On newegg.com, I read another user had similar problems with an AMD cpu.

== Agenda

Talk 1: Building an open-source Python application the right way
by Kiran Gangadharan
Duration: 45min

This talk covers the best practices/conventions to be followed while
building a full fledged and open source Python application. The talk
also presents a template project that will help to bootstrap an open
source project.

Talk 2: Python Byte Code Hacking - Part 2
by Vijay Kumar
Duration: 45min

The Python interpreter converts Python programs into byte codes and
executes them. In this talk we will understand what these byte codes
mean, how to disassemble them and how to modify them to do some really
cool stuff. We will work our way up with small examples and at the end
of the talk we will have our own working implementation of this recipe
-- http://code.activestate.com/**recipes/576944-the-goto-**decorator/<http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576944-the-goto-decorator/>

If you would like to give a lightning talk, just come prepared, we
will be able to accommodate you.

If you are new to Python, the tutorial at
http://learnxinyminutes.com/**docs/python/<http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/>will
give you a quick
overview of what Python is all about.

Regards,
Vijay

Dear all,

Good evening,

Our management decided to move our production server from existing provider
to azure.

We have centOS on both. It is for classified's related site, considerable
amount of data and ~thousands users with their disc space quota.

This is our first time moving our servers. I need your Guidance and
suggestions on these.
1) How to migrate the mysql db.
2) How to manage the emails during the downtime.
3) Manage the files
4) How to security check list for the new system
5) Anything that I missed out!.


Since first time, planning to be more cautious.

Any reference documents Highly appreciated.

Thank you all!

My intention is not to pass on my work to someone.But I'm looking for
earlier experiences who have done this before.All I wanted is some *need
advice on best approach,working reference and Suggestions*,Since I can't
try all the resources available on live.This is the reason am here.

Moving from GNU/Linux to windows ?

Try to convince management not to so.

or moving to another GNU/Linux hosted over azure?

My replies are hoping that you are moving to another GNU/Linux server.

Plan for a day or more downtime.
Depends on the data size.

Setup a stage server to practice all the move.
Dont try anything on the server without trying on stage server.

> 1) How to migrate the mysql db.

Read and practice this.
http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/09/backup-and-restore-mysql-database-using-mysqldump/


> 2) How to manage the emails during the downtime.


Add another mail server to handle the emails.
Add MX records in DNS.


> 3) Manage the files

Use rsync to copy the files properly.
check its options too.

http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/09/rsync-command-examples/

> 4) How to security check list for the new system

Add iptables firewall rules.
Secure apache and mysql with their config files.

> 5) Anything that I missed out!.


rsync with archive mode for users data.
it will make the owenership and permissions in sync.



> Since first time, planning to be more cautious.

Yes. Plan well and practice in a stage server.
Without stage server practise, dont enter into production.

Create a checklist for to-do.
Note down all the activities you do.


Blog your experiences.

Wishes.

Do keep your old machine in place till you're sure everything is
working on the new machine, even if it means paying for an idle
machine for a month or two. It might end up being invaluable in case
something isn't moved correctly or left out.
I'll also suggest you have a complete description of what you have on
your server and document it somewhere, if you don't already, and keep
updating it so you don't miss out on anything.

> This is our first time moving our servers. I need your Guidance and
> suggestions on these.
> 1) How to migrate the mysql db.

mysqldump works pretty neatly for DBs, but you'd also want to keep
usernames and passwords also intact. To start with, have a look at
http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/move-mysql-users-privileges-grants-from-one-host-to-new-host.html

> 2) How to manage the emails during the downtime.

You don't need to have a downtime. Look at imap proxy for the same.
There was a really good thread on one of the ILUG lists. I'll pass it
across if I can dig it out. It covered this topic really well.

> 3) Manage the files

Manage? You can just use rsync to sync the files between both the machines.

> 5) Anything that I missed out!.

Your configurations. Write scripts to handle installation and
configuration or use readymade tools for the same wherever possible.

Also, consider hiring a consultant who'll plan it out and you be the
one who executes it. That way you'll gain experience and at the same
time not lose important data. It can be more costly to lose data or
time as opposed to hiring an experienced hand.

If you want to create some easy, disposable and shareable web folders
to share files with your friends, OneTimeBox offers the best solution
for you. The concept is simple. You create a box there, upload all the
files there, give the link to your friends and it?s done. The box
stays online for one week only, after which the box is disposed off
and the files are no longer available.

The program has been recently open sourced, thus you can roll your own
OneTimeBox installation. The code is available on GitHub.

https://github.com/oliversong/onetimebox

Check out and create your first box here.

Hi all,

Trusty image 3 (20131022.1) is now available via the trusty channel.

We don't currently support OTA updates from saucy to trusty, so you'll
need to update via a cable, for example like this:-

phablet-flash ubuntu-system --channel trusty

Once you switch channel to trusty you can then use OTA updates as you
previously did on saucy though.

However there's currently a bug (https://launchpad.net/bugs/1243577)
which means you lose all apps which you previously had installed and
will need to reinstall them.

Your data in /home/phablet is safe though.

Changelogs in the usual place:-

Hi all,

I need to know how to redirect the o/p of the script both to stdout and to
file.

I need to run the script from job scheduler,so I cant use pipes or tee
command from the command line.so the redirection need to be coded in the
script itself.

Use
echo "something" >> filename
in the script itself whenever you need.

You can use the tee command in the script and make the script execute under
cron.
THis seems so simplistic that it will be better if you describe a little
more

I need to schedule the script on CTRL_M job scheduler .....not  cron..
I am grabbing certain o/p from remote server through ssh from script ...so
I can't use tee command or echo >> in  the ssh commands.

I have used exec >filename.txt inside a script, it redirects all the o/p to
the file.
My requirement is to get the o/p captured in both file and stdout

If you are a student and is really interested in a software job,  some
actual practice may help. Here are a few things you can do:

Start early ? even in the very first year of your college. Just spend
a few hours each week.  Pick an easy language to learn like Python or
Ruby.

Learn to program  by writing lots of small useful tools, games, apps.

Share your programs with others and ask for feedback. Ask them whether
they find it useful.

Share the code on github (it is free) or other repositories.  Post the
link on Geek forums and request feedback too (but please don?t spam
the groups).

Don?t get upset if people criticize it. All feedback is good when you
are learning.
Don?t take it personally. If some one cares enough to look at it and
give you comments, that is a good thing.

Once in a while, take all the stuff you have written, factor out
common code and create libraries/modules that you can reuse. Go back
and change the programs to reuse these libraries.

Repeat 2-6  as many times as you can, every week, every month.

Include your github links in your resume.

Hi,

We are expanding our existing RoR team by five more developers. We are
looking for 4 - 5 second hand computers in good shape with LCD / LED
monitors. Systems must be atleast Core2Duo processors. Laptops can
also be considered. Do let us know if anybody has spare computers /
upgrading existing systems and willing to sell the old ones. Location:

She spoke on issues in women contributing to FOSS from a middle-class
hetero-normative patriarchy friendly perspective and
missed far too many basic points (at least in the youtube video).

Hello all,

Please help with the following problem. It will be great to help educational

If someone from Chennai LUG would be able to give support, that would be 
awesome.

Subject: [Ilugc] Report Log When User Exceeds Limits Set in limits.conf
Message-ID: <52692479.30203@gmail.com>

Hi.
I am looking help for this question here
http://serverfault.com/questions/536587/logging-when-limit-exceeds

We are having a website hosted on linux server where user can create
account and learn programming language.
For new user we create new linux user account and assign limits on his
cpu, memory usage and max number of processes.

Whenever user exceeds this limit the system gives error "to customer" on
his terminal.

What we want is that, system should give error "to us", the "web site
operator" or "admin" telling us that, the user called XYZ has exceeded
limit of cpu or memory or max number of processes.

How can we achieve this logging?

Also what is the best approach to assign and limit server resources for
users in case of online learning platform. Where user creates separate
linux account for himself?

Thanks in advance.

Hi

I am trying to understand how do we use the keyword *perlcode* in the
swatch configuration file,  Could you point me in the correct direction ?
I do not know perl and may be due to this I am failing at understating what
goggling brings up.

Can you tell me about your experience with OS X which led you to this
extreme decision not to use it even if they give you money?

Recently, Tamil wikipedia celebrated its 10th year.
On 28 september, Tamil wikipedians went to to mahabalipuram as a
cultural trip and to have fun as this is the very first time they all
met face to face.
The trip was so useful to know each other and to discuss tons of things.

On 29th Sep, we had a great gathering at Anna University.
Talks, Demos and discussions made the event a grand success.

Here is a glimpses of the event.

>From http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
-------------
A program is free software if the program's users have the four
essential freedoms:

The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).

The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does
your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a
precondition for this.

The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).

The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
(freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance
to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a
precondition for this.
--------------

When GNU/Linux comes with all these freedoms, why do we need OS-X?
OS-X does not give any of these freedoms.
It is only free in cost.

How can anyone accepts something, because it is free of cost?

 @Shrini:

Hope you misunderstood the point.  We are not discussing just about the
freedom here, as everyone knows about GNU/Linux and the four freedoms.  Mr.
Arun's point is that, whether the person has any experience with Apple OS X
as he says it is worthless.

I posted the link with the intention, the members would understand that
"The era of paid/proprietary operating systems will soon come to an end,
and Apple's decision is just a  beginning towards that".

"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then
you win".

Mahatma Gandhi<http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/m/mahatma_gandhi.html>
Soon we all will be seeing the day were **all proprietary operating systems
and applications** becoming Free Software.

Correct me if I am wrong.

Hi Srini,

Anyways, Apple is not all that bad, take a look at:
http://www.apple.com/opensource/
http://www.opensource.apple.com/
http://www.opensource.apple.com/release/mac-os-x-1084/  < Source code of
MAC OS X 10.8.4
http://www.macosforge.org/

The context of my reply was based on the word "worthless" used by Prasanna,
quoted below:

I agree on the issues relating to freedom. That is a no-brainer. Apple and
Freedom.
My argument was based on the technical merits of OS X and I stand by it.

and my disclosure:
I love 'computing' and it is one of the greatest interest in my life. I am
not a fan boy of any one OS. I am excited equally when I work with:
Linux - For it's freedom, free beer, humane and community models and more
than anything feeling good seeing people putting in valuable time to create
stuff for everybody to use.
Apple - Engineering, Perfection and Beauty. ...and XCode (personal
preference as be best free IDE)
Microsoft - Win32 SDK (personal preference as the greatest API ever made)
and MS Office.

Arun

Even Oracle, Microsoft provide open source code. Apple provides the
code open but it destroys the real essence of having open source
(choice and freedom) and also wants to destroy competitiors by unfair
means.

It is worthless because the benefits to cost ratio is extremely small.
Even if they give money to use the OS there will be hidden charges /
things that will make you rely on them, then they will monopolise it
to make huge money. Also they are big patent troll company with not
much real innovation in technology (apple just markets things as far
as I know or even claims they did it even if it was a copy).

Agreed apple products are beauty but there comes a danger with beauty
(based on some old saying) and the danger is monopoly.

Agreed Microsoft maintains API compatibility to a huge extent but
their business strategy of crushing other's business instead of
competing is going to affect all.

Opinion of others may vary.

Hi All,

GNU Octave project is introducing GUI in its 3.8 release (should be
available soon). This is the best opportunity to translate it in
Indian languages. Request volunteers to come up and translate it. I
have forwarded the original mailing list message below.

Thanks,
PrasannaKumar

The 3.8 release is on schedule and will feature a GUI for the first time ever!

We need your help, though, in bringing Octave to the globe.  The strings in
the GUI need to be translated to local languages.  As of today (Nov. 24,
2013) we have translations for the following languages and locales:

be_BY
de_DE
en_US
es_ES
fr_FR
nl_NL
pt_BR
ru_RU
uk_UA

If you would like to bring Octave to your language and home then check out
Octave sources from Mercurial and navigate to the libgui/languages
directory.  The file en_US.ts can be copied to a new name to form the basis
of the new translation file.

Thanks,
your friendly Octave volunteers

I believe OSX kernel is based on a BSD flavor UNIX kernel, so they are
liable to opensource the parts of the code. They do not opensource, the
important part of their system such as the GUI engine, etc.

Apple, Oracle, Microsoft, even Google are companies that support
opensource, in a way but the when it comes to something really important
like their key technology they won't open source it.

*Now back to the main topic:*

I do not agree to this article, as the price of Operating System has not
gone to 0, but the way they collect the money has just changed. They will
just increase the price of the hardware such that,  it will appear as the
OS is given for Free. Like sometime ago laptop manufactures used to say you
will get windows laptop for 35K, hiding the fact that 3K was for the
operating system. With the increase in popularity mobile devises such a
method of sale (hardware + OS) became more widely accepted such that most
people don't know that part of the cost of their phones is for the OS.
Until recently for every android phone sold, a price had to be paid to
microsoft for using some of their patents[1].

GNU Linux, would be the only OS that is given for free and I mean free in
all sense.

Message-ID: <CAND27953OSiZB8K55-7z9q9qGWLcaoKY+nFsnnOLJgHsFj4mCg@mail.gmail.com>

We often need to collect data from many people and share the collected
details with them.

For example, If I want to collect the list of "Free Software
Contributors in Tamilnadu", I can use a wiki to collect details.

It is tough to maintain the wiki from spam for admins (that's why
ilugc wiki is inactive) and not users friendly for quickly adding
details. (will ask even tough captcha, if we want to secure from
spam).

The quick and dirty solutions seems to use a google doc form builder
and get the details from the users as a form.

Users can input the data easily.

Collected details are stored as a spread sheet. We can share the sheet
url to anyone with permissions to view only or edit.

Currently, there is no Free/Open Source alternate for this.

I hope we can easily build such system using any web framework
like cakephp, django, Ruby on Rails, etc.

Reply here or contact me if anyone is interested in doing this.

Share this info to your friends to get interested volunteers.

Thanks.

So by this are you referring to an opensource survey tool? If so then lime
survey (https://www.limesurvey.org/en/) is the best open source survey tool
i have came across.

Thanks for the reply.

after filling the demo survey, it displayed
https://www.limesurvey.org/en/demo

=======
Thank you!

Your survey responses have been recorded.
=======

There is no link to see the filled surveys.

This is not I want.

I want a system to show already filled details, so that anyone can see
and decide what to fill.

Example:
Let us call for a demo stalls for Software Freedom Day.
Anyone will want to see the already registered stalls, before
registering a new one,
to avoid duplicate stalls.

A link to share the filled form results, with options for few users to
edit and others to read only view is required.

PLEASE FORWARD TO WHOEVER MIGHT BE INTERESTED

Wikimedia will participate in the FOSS Outreach Program for Women - Round
7. Interns of this program work full time in an open source project during
4 months.

https://www.mediawiki.org/**wiki/FOSS_Outreach_Program_**for_Women<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/FOSS_Outreach_Program_for_Women>

Candidates interested are encouraged to add themselves to the table at
https://www.mediawiki.org/**wiki/Outreach_Program_for_**
Women/Round_7#Candidates<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Outreach_Program_for_Women/Round_7#Candidates>-
even if you are still preparing your proposal.

We are actually running late (my fault). The application process is open
until November 11. The internship period goes from December 10 to March 10,
2014.

The Wikimedia Foundation is planning to fund up to 8 interns. This is a
great opportunity for Wikimedia / MediaWiki related projects. Our process
is quite simple: define a project, find the mentors and go for it!

https://www.mediawiki.org/**wiki/Mentorship_programs/**Possible_projects<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Mentorship_programs/Possible_projects>

https://www.mediawiki.org/**wiki/Mentorship_programs/**Possible_mentors<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Mentorship_programs/Possible_mentors>

The previous featured projects and confirmed mentors have been moved
respectively to the Raw and Bench sections. If you want to participate in
this OPW round move the entries back to the featured sections.

New projects and mentors are welcome too, of course!

If you have any questions please ask.

After a quick survey through the main teams involved in the Summer round of
OPW and Google Summer of Code, it is clear that most of them need a rest.
This is a good chance for new mentors and projects to join in!

I'm pinging other Wmikimedia Foundation teams e.g. Analytics, which already
have committed to bring a proposal and two mentors. What about projects
like Commons, Wikinews, Wikivoyage...? What about bots, gadgets,
templates...? What about mobile apps not supported by the WMF mobile
team...? What about mediawiki.org and wikitech.wikimedia.org...? Are there
any technical projects that tech events organizers could benefit from...?

When thinking about project proposals, a good rule of thumb is: tasks that
would take two weeks of full time work to an experienced contributor.

We found that these two weeks can be translated in approximately six weeks
of an intern. This time is easily wrapped with as much time or more for
onboarding to open source development and the Wikimedia tech community,
setting up your environment and tools, testing, bugfixing, documentation
and deployment.

If you are interested, we have documented more lessons learned at
https://www.mediawiki.org/**wiki/Mentorship_programs/**Lessons_learned<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Mentorship_programs/Lessons_learned>

If you want to run a cron job to kill :

$ ps aux | grep Herrie
mohan     3992 99.9  0.0   1744   240 pts/0    R    11:55  11:58 Herrie
mohan     4094  0.0  0.0   3780   780 pts/1    S+   12:07   0:00 grep
--color=auto Herrie

Here is the shell script:

$ cat kill_process1.sh

#!/usr/bin/env sh

process_name="Herrie"
pid=$(ps aux | grep $process_name | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')
if [ ! -z "$pid" ]; then
    kill -9 $pid
    exit 0
fi

$ ./kill_process1.sh

with Erlang and CouchDB. Most of the core committers are on the list,
and we're here to help you, and answer any questions you might have
about getting started.

Don't worry: this isn't the list we discuss project decisions on. And
there's no minimum experience level necessary. Complete Erlang newbies
welcome!

Come join us at:

erlang at couchdb.apache.org

You an subscribe by sending a mail to :

There are various command-line Twitter clients that you can use to post
to Twitter. Twidge (https://github.com/jgoerzen/twidge/wiki) is one I
have used a bit. Searching the web for the same using a search engine
like Google will give you more results.

Recently I read this comment on my friends profile:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"If you are the owner/boss of a company that has computers, I would
SINCERELY request that you get someone to AUDIT all your software. While
you may THINK you are using licensed software, you will be SHOCKED to
discover what other folks download/deploy.

This can lead to a very UGLY situation (as experience by me this week).

PLEASE GO ALL LEGIT on ALL SOFTWARE (however 'small & silly' it may be... "
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now my question is, if someone is using Open Source softwares in his office
/ business then is there any need of Auditing?

Please share your views.

Thank you.

Yes, someone can still installed pirated apps or download pirated
audio/video. But, auditing isn't the only solution. Sensible policies
and user training goes a long way in ensuring that such cases don't
occur.

oh yes, absolutely - there are licenses for Open source software too, and a
company might be infringing on them by one or more ways - for example

1. Using assets (code, images, text, data) without attributing credit

2. Hiding branding information that attributes towards original author

3. Building upon code without contributing to the main branch which might
be on certain restrictive licenses

You might understand the magnitude if you know that there are many
companies that do open source audits as a business like blackduck, and
there are products that scourge through code to bring out any
non-compliances.

Good initiative.  You could have mentioned about 'kaniyam' magazine
somewhere in the article, so that it could have reached a wider audience.

Message-ID: <CAND2797OM3YKDOtz07a6QqbmFzhWDgAzYWv04NFgF7PAr700ew@mail.gmail.com>

I have a 4 years old server running Debian 4 and Zimbra email server
version 4.


It has 4GB RAM and now we need to upgrade 8GB RAM.

Unfortunately, the DDR 2 RAM for the old server are not available in market.


Old server details.


Core2Duo Quadcore CPU

Intel Motherboard

DDR2 4 GB RAM



Now we have a new server with following config.


Core i3 CPU

Asus P8H61- M LE Motherborad

DDR3 8 GB RAM

I removed the hard disk from old server and inserted into new server,
hoping that it will work as normal.

But, it seems that old debian 4 can not recognize the new hardware and dont
have the modules.

See the error message we get while booting.

https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/c-B8Jv3DfJWS6j-EexKxSIJG8RGg5-YvtRYupVay4rWD=w551-h543-no

/dev/sda2 is the / partition.


Is there any way to make this system up and running with new hardware?

Debian 4 is no longer supported and it is recommended to upgrade to
Debian stable (7.0 - Wheezy) or old stable (6.0 - Squeeze).

You can try dist-upgrading to stable/oldstable distros and see if
things work. Otherwise you might have to fiddle with stuff like
compiling the kernel and etc., which imho is unnecessary most of the
times when a distro like Debian provides well-tested stable packages.
Ymmv. You could also try installing the latest debian on the new
server and try to migrate various software running on the old server
and copy the data to the new server.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Which version of kernel is the Debian running on? The most likely problem
is that the driver for the hardware (say sata  controller?) is not there.
Pull in a new kernel and try to compile with the old configuration and
boot. Then may be you can think of upgrading ;-)

I hope the existing kernel in Debian 4 (etch) is 2.6.18..  You can try the
following

Put the hard disk back to the old server, and try installing the latest
kernel (manually) for etch (2.6.24) from

http://www.debian.org/releases/etch/debian-installer/etchnhalf

and it should create a new initramfs image for the new kernel.

Now, put the hard disk in the new server and see it if boots properly after
upgrading the kernel.

It is better to install Debian 7 and migrate the data there. It will
be easier and better. I feel 2.6.24 is also too old. Around 25 kernel
releases were made after that (which means more than 50 months).

In case the SATA chipset supports  the Legacy Mode (IDE) (see BIOS),
set it to "Legacy" and try booting the system.
You can then try the suggestions made by other members in this
discussion i.e. upgrading the kernel / dist upgrade etc.

Do let us know if the Legacy mode works for you.

1. Check the SATA cable connection etc.
2. Install the HDD in another system and see if problem moves.

Yes?  -  you have a bad hard disk.
No? - your motherboard is suspect.

    # chgrp group2 sample.txt

2. To change the files and its subdirectories of a directory named
'test' from root group to new

3. To change the group for the specific file test.txt

Dear all,

I wanted to install the following Fedora-20 ARM HFP Image (pre-release
only) on BeagleBone Black.

Fedora-Minimal-VFAT-armhfp-20-Alpha-4-sda.raw.xz

Is it possible to flash directly into the internal 2GB eMMC flash available
in BeagleBoneBlack instead of using external SD Card.

Any pointers would be helpful.

When I read the OP's quoted link, the content looked 'deja vu' but I
could not recall where I had read it.  Thanks for the memory jogger.

I totally agree about proper attribution.  A n00b doing this kind of

Message-ID: <CALDskyzKJm+c4KFtgsdjOWHy08EGHw043w75nFQyQZc2cuOPrA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear folks,

I have been using a 128 GB SSD disk in place of a regular SATA hard drive
 for one of my OpenBSD machines and the write speed is phenomenal.

So is the read speed which of course is still better.

I am very happy.

Only grouse being it is not 2Tb in size. ;)

But we will get there.

There are tools to measure disk RPM and read and write performance.

I use iostat and you can perceive it thro' general copy and use performance.

After all anything like Db or video uses the secondary storage heavily.

Now change of topic.

Recently my laptop got drenched in the terrace rain and the Windows7 I used to
use for skype ,youtube, Chrome went away. Interestingly the hard disk
is not destroyed
 but well Windows will not allow hard disk portability.

Then I took a spare box and installed Debian Wheezy.

I am typing this mail from that.

Guess what?

I don't need Windows anymore. Skype video with my webcam works, skype screen
sharing works,youtube video works and the icing on the cake is the Google Chrome
 browser.

Phenomenal!

Moreover I don't miss firebug in firefox since Chrome comes with a
Debian package to
 install the inline debugger(Ctrl+Shift+j).

Overall I am very happy and pleasantly surprised.

My reason for loving OpenBSD has got to do with my knowledge of the
kernel of OpenBSD,FreeBSD,Linux etc. when I was developing IPsec stack in 2005.

Anyway OpenBSD has several other things too but Linux has certainly
graduates as a
 highly usable desktop OS.

OpenBSD is more of serious server side stuff and
engineer/scientist/hacker thing.

I have a old qmail server running on Debian 4 box.

But can send and receive from domains on the same server.
Can send emails to any other outer domains too.

The logs says as

Dont know how the qmail connects with the any scanner.

Qmail runs as a tcpserver process.

Need some suggestions on how to proceed further on fixing this.

Subject: [Ilugc] clustering tutorial part I
Message-ID: <CALDskyz0_EzMNSN3cBvtxuFwryypZ3S_ahtJ5H7ZfPP10Tx9qg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear lug,

I am getting some experience with clustering though I will get more
knowledge after I
finish the deployment in London.

And I knew something about clustering for some 4 years now.

Let me go about it in common man's speak.

I understand LUG audience pretty well and I can also present things in a simple
 fashion so let us get started.

First what is clustering?

Clustering is the ability of multiple disparate nodes(computers) to
perform a common goal.

It is like multiple lungs breathing for one person.

And just like Citthars can jump from one body to another and come back
to their body,
 cluster nodes can also do something similar(koodu vitu koodu payarthu).

Right so clustering can be done at an application level like web
service, or SMTP or
 Db application or anything you can think of.

And it can also work at a deeper lower level in which the entire OS
node is clustered.

For instance just like double action in movies multiple separate nodes
can do the same thing
 and end users will not know the difference.

There are also issues like carrying across live sessions,TCP
connections etc. or just
 ensuring 100% availability.

Okay now rest of the stuff in next mail.

Message-ID: <CALDskyxjFR6gZN9HNGAp68BDk6c22=AMG2gQuj86Cq7zm4vj-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Now that we know what clustering is about let us get to the lower level details.

And specifically what I know and what I do.

>From a commercial point of view if you are a networking service vendor, if you
 provide a mail server or spam control or firewall or a bug database
or something
 then you can provide 100% uptime using clustering even during catastrophic
 failures like power outage, someone tripping the cable and so on.

It works at separate layers(not OSI) just like everything in the UNIX world.

First there is a protocol called CARP or VRRP which has idea of a
virtual and physical
 IP address.

The virtual IP address is assigned to multiple nodes and only one of
them will be
 active at a time and respond at the IP layer.

So this is an "active passive" clustering.

Which means we scale out rather than scale up. Resources are not
optimally utilized.

Moreover depending upon the use case in question you certainly have to
sync the data
between the cluster participants.

Now to implement real active active clustering in which load sharing
is effected you need to
 some layer 7 redirecting using a 'service redirector' to share the
service load between
 cluster nodes.

And this means that the service redirector node now acts as  a single
point of failure
 and so that needs to be clustered active passive.

Now you have a perfect situation in which load is shared optimally and
we also ride on the
 CARP/VRRP active passive case which is the foundation of clustering.

Now if you have been with me so far then I shall be discussing my
fresh knowledge in this
 domain as and when I wrap up my deployment in my customer location in London.

Also the service redirector node can bind to separate IP addresses and
serve multiple
 protocols with one physical network card and bare metal.

Don't know much about qmail operations but I guess it is using
spamassasin filter and the config would be in qmail's config files.
Try setting spamassasin number to less restrictive.   Also try
increasing qmail's log verbosity.

Surprising to see the revalation from you , but yeah I guess its been
3 -4 years or more since everything works as long as you use some
"stable" distro in the GNU/Linux world and gives a complete desktop
experience .

The only thing missing was the games which hopefully steam could
bridge the gap .

Thanks for sharing the article.  I liked the following quote from the
article

<quote>

Linux is not interested in market share. Linux does not have customers.
Linux does not have shareholders, or a responsibility to the bottom line.
Linux was not created to make money. Linux does not have the goal of being
the most popular and widespread OS on the planet.

All the Linux community wants is to create a really good, fully-featured,
free operating system. If that results in Linux becoming a hugely popular
OS, then that's great. If that results in Linux having the most intuitive,
user-friendly interface ever created, then that's great. If that results in
Linux becoming the basis of a multi-billion dollar industry, then that's
great.

It's great, but it's not the point. The point is to make Linux the best OS
that the community is capable of making. Not for other people: For itself.
The oh-so-common threats of "Linux will never take over the desktop unless
it does such-and-such" are simply irrelevant: The Linux community isn't
trying to take over the desktop. They really don't care if it gets good
enough to make it onto your desktop, so long as it stays good enough to
remain on theirs. The highly-vocal MS-haters, pro-Linux zealots, and
money-making FOSS purveyors might be loud, but they're still minorities.

That's what the Linux community wants: an OS that can be installed by
whoever really wants it. So if you're considering switching to Linux, first
ask yourself what you really want.

I am encountering X11 issues with the embedded Matrox G200eW chipset
on a server motherboard (Supermicro).   The server board has only x8
PCI-e slots; no x16 slots (required for the VGA cards readily
available).

Debian Squeeze (amd64) stock 2.6.32 kernel installed by the distro.

The Linux kernel fails to load the MGA (Xorg) driver and falls back to
VESA Frame Buffer driver.  The VESA driver does not support the
hardware features that our application needs (xawtv/tvtime).

I have searched but have not found any conclusive solution to the
problem.  A few have suggested installing a PCI Express x1 VGA card
like this one [a].

Please share OEM/model + Indian vendor, in case you have come across
anyone stocking PCI express x1 VGA cards.

Subject: [ATTENTION] LTS Release - Urgent Need for More People
To: ubuntu-gnome <ubuntu-gnome at lists.ubuntu.com>


Hello Everyone,

As you may know, 14.04 Cycle is an LTS (Long Term Support) Cycle.
Having that said, Ubuntu and most of the official flavours will have
LTS Release. For the moment, the lack of Manpower could keep us away
from having an LTS Release. However, after a discussion with our
Developers, we'd like to announce the urgent need for these roles:

1- Someone with Bug Control to 'Actively Commit' to triaging Ubuntu GNOME bugs.

2- Couple of people helping out with 'Bug Fixing'.

3- People to help with 'Packaging' on the PPA's

PLEASE NOTE: We are looking for people with experience and skills! We
NEED people to commit for 3-5 years support and not just join for few
months then leave.

NO PROMISES to be made but we would be comfortable enough to submit an
application to the Technical Board in order to have an LTS Release
when we will have volunteers who can actively contribute and help us.

If you have the required experience and skills or if you know someone
who has, please let us know :)

Thank you!


Please, FEEL FREE to share this email and spread the word.
