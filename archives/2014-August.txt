Subject: [Ilugc] perl and mail
Message-ID: <CALDskyzB2X9_KQwKQ+zaksaAoYKWH+pSsDq19+53HG4EfbyE0w@mail.gmail.com>

I am a very old perl programmer, I have released some CPAN modules but they
don't seem to be doing all that well.

Anyway I am subscribed to postfix mailing list and I often see references
to perl being made.

That strikes me rather odd.

People say perl is dying, it is too complex, it is too UNIX dependent and
so on.

But postfix mail server and perl seems to go together.

And perl CPAN modules are being used to automate mail sending and solve
many issues with postfix.

I am also getting some jobs in odesk based on my perl knowledge.

Even spamassassin is written in perl, so it amavisd-new.

For me perl is an integral part of my UNIX life though of course C comes in
from time to time.

Look at daily changes in perl modules at http://search.cpan.org/recent .
It shows how active perl development is.

I came across this this site/blog during my casual browsing.
Some of the articles are interesting and neatly explained with clear 
diagrams/pictures.
The author, I heard is also writing a Linux Kernel Internals book(I 
believe, he is planning to release it free) which would be released 
later(he is not sure when it would be).
But I am expecting the book would be very useful.

Meanwhile, browse through the articles and lot of them are useful and 
interesting.
http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/archives/

Another similar book related to Kernel Internals(but based on old kernel - 
mostly still relevant and useful),
"The Art of Linux Kernel Design: Illustrating the Operating System Design 
Principle and Implementation".

note: I do not know the author(s) personally or there is no 
benefit/business motive in this.

thanks

Message-ID: <CAK1T7EsOgUDaesgvHWTVEV0a=G=WFc+myG7KHDTBh7cyhMtK7w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have written txt2unicode [1] converter which will convert any type
of encode to unicode. At the moment it will convert only Tamil
encodes.

Supported encodes are
1. anjal, 2. bamini, 3. boomi, 4. dinakaran, 5.dinamani,
6.dinathanthy, 7.kavipriya, 8.murasoli, 9.mylai, 10.nakkeeran,
11.roman, 12.tab, 13.tam & 14.tscii

Also I have written "auto2unicode" function which will find input
text's encode automatically and convert to unicode. It can find 11
encodes out of 14 above encodes.

I took tscii sample input from [2] and tested out.

 "auto2unicode" function able to find "tscii" encode and convert to
unicode successfully.

I need remaining 13 encodes sample text to test it.

If anybody have these Tamil encoded sample text files, please send me
offline or share here any link to get sample for the same.

Suggestions are welcome.

Subject: [Ilugc] MySQL - unable to connect to MySQL db from another host on
	same LAN
Message-ID: <CAHhM8gDJsxqoqtbJdeP87VCQhf361kFevyD1uZwtqXYvo_zOJg@mail.gmail.com>

I have 2 AWS instances (CentOS 6.5 64bit AMI)
(a) Apache, PHP, mysql client package  (IP = A, alias name aws-appsrv)
(b) mysql-server (IP = B alias name aws-dbsrv).

I have configured mysql server on B to accept connections on 3306 from A.
I have also configured mysql server on B to accept connections for
'root' user from A both with IP number (A) and alias name
(aws-appsrv).

On mysql server (B)
mysql> select user,host,grant_priv from user;
+------+------------+------------+
| user | host       | grant_priv |
+------+------------+------------+
| root | localhost  | Y          |
| root | aws-appsrv | Y          |
| root | 127.0.0.1  | Y          |
| root | 10.0.0.244 | Y          |
+------+------------+------------+

On aws-appsrv (A), when I connect to mysql server on B as 'root' user,
I get the following error.

# mysql -u root -h aws-dbsrv -D mysql -p
Enter password:
ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'aws-appsrv' (using
password: YES)

I have searched for a solution but have not come across one that meets
my use case scenario.

What am I missing?

1. Could you try logging in locally by adding an appropriate grant
statement ?

2. Try using the FQDN for the grant statement on mysql
server.
                             GRANT ALL ON YourDB.* TO 'root'@
'mysql_root_password';
                             FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

I have already done the following before trying to connect

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'A' WITH GRANT OPTION;

where A is the IP address and

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'aws-appsrv' WITH GRANT OPTION;

where aws-appsrv is resolved by /etc/hosts with the line.

A    aws-appsrv

Does your security group allow the mysql port 3306?

is IPTables blocking the port?

check using the following command



*telnet aws-appsrv 3306  *

Is the mysql server listening on all interfaces?
I think by default it listens only on localhost or 127.0.0.1

Another naive point, just to be sure : Have you opened up port 3306 in the
firewall?

Yes, bind_address=0.0.0.0  (allow connection from any IP number).

AWS, has a pretty neat concept called "Security Groups"  wherein you
can define inbount and outbound traffic.

Checked that as well, inbound to 3306 is allowed.
 I can telnet aws-appsrv 3306 from a different node and get connection
and prompt for password.

One of my Member of Technical Staff found the solution.
Ref. URL <http://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-grant.aspx>

Specifically the following commands in a 'mysql -u root -p' session

CREATE USER '<username>'@'<hostname>' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
create database userdb;
GRANT ALL userdb.* TO '<username>'@'<hostname>' WITH GRANT OPTION;
flush privileges;

To avoid ambiguity,  I use DD/MMM/YYYY or YYYY/MM/DD for dates and 24
hour format for time.  I also add time zone when people from multiple
time zones participate in chats/web conferences.

*Hi All,*

According to a report on economictimes.indiatimes.com
<http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/india-opens-up-to-operating-system-ubuntu/articleshow/39682855.cms>
,
http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/india-opens-up-to-operating-system-ubuntu/articleshow/39682855.cms
the regional manager for Asia Pacific at Canonical, Prakash Advani, says
that ?India is the fastest growing market for us with great stickiness and
adoption of Ubuntu. It is definitely one of our key focus markets globally.?

In fact, the rate of adoption for Ubuntu has been quite impressive and it
has registered a 50% increase year-over-year, which is a lot if you
consider the adversaries it's up against.

Hi Anwar,

You will not find it because I guess support for raring is stopped.  See
your URL it states raring-security.

Few suggestions:

#1 If you use the shell, and would like to view the git branch at the
command prompt, add the following to your .bashrc (or appropriate
init) file:

export PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[01;34m\]
\w\[\033[01;33m\]$(__git_ps1)\[\033[01;34m\] \$\[\033[00m\] '
. /home/user/.git-prompt.sh

You can get the .git-prompt.sh  from:

Hi,

Any  activity planned for this year SFD.

SFD falls on 3rd week of Sept and  this year I guess it is on 20th of Sept
2014.

My opinion is that we can take a lead and organize this event and ask the
FOSS lovers to join us.

Add your thoughts.

Message-ID: <53eb70c8.c166440a.50b8.6439@mx.google.com>

Hi All,

With just one more month to go for PyCon India 2014, we have shifted
gears and switched to hyperdrive.  The first-cut of the conference
schedule is up! After the long list of proposals being submitted, the
community voting and the review process plus confirmation, finally we
have everything sorted out and ready to go.

Checkout the conference schedule here:
http://in.pycon.org/2014/schedule.html

With 3 Keynotes, 22 Talks, 9 Workshops along with open spaces,
lightning talks and panel discussions, this year's PyCon India will be
filled with three days of fun, geeking out with your fellow
Pythonistas, brainstorming on ideas, and altogether having a great
time!

So no more procrastination.  For those of you who were waiting to see
the conference schedule to plan your trip, this is it. For the rest of
you who are still thinking about attending the conference, you might
want to grab your tickets soon lest they should get sold out.

Book your tickets ( http://pyconindia2014.doattend.com ), book your
accommodation and plan your trip right now! The last weekend of
September is going to be epic.

Subject: [Ilugc] [[Doubt]] Information should be free. Why?
Message-ID: <CAP6xennHizRLwxDmNbfoLdn++fWTW1aXw7ipGxTymzHzRaG0zg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings All,

Recently I was watching documentary on *The Internet's Own Boy: The Story
of Aaron Swartz *(though, late but never).

In the documentary, Aaron said many times that *'information should be
free'*.

What exactly did he mean by this?

Why most science journals or PhD holders or research fellows don't publish
their work free of cost?

(Obviously, why should one publish his/her work free of cost for which
(s)he worked tirelessly or burned midnight oil)

Seen few journals for my cousin's research work and all were paid :(

Why don't libraries or particular universities publish their research
fellows work for free of cost? It means they are looking for business and
not for serving to society (actually they meant for the latter purpose).

If FB and Google are providing their services to everyone free of cost.
Then on the other side they are collecting our data and selling it to
marketing companies for profit making so it means there is a business in
this deal.

But what was his theory behind this statement: *'information should be
free'.*

What I perceived from this is: He wanted to educate and improve the society
by spreading knowledge and that too free of cost.

Anyways, respect to that young boy who sacrificed his life at such a young
age for such a beautiful thought (when mostly among us do not know what
exactly they want to do in their life).

He will be missed for sure.

RIP Aaron. :(

Kindly shed some light on the aforesaid doubt and do not hesitate to notify
me if I am wrong at some point.

Thank you.

P.S. : If you think this is not an apt place/group to ask such doubt then
you are free to ignore this email.

Pursuit of knowledge is also a profession and not a hobby, at least for a large number of academics.

Most good journals require a large amount of money to process each article / paper. It takes a lot of effort for secretarial / editorial staff to maintain good quality. Still a lot of medical journals go free after a period of self imposed restricted / paid access. This period usually varies from 5 to 10 years. Must be same for other academic disciplines also.

around but just look at yourself.  If you feel you have done your
share in growing and nurturing the Indian Python Community, please do
not hesitate to nominate yourself.

Here is the nomination form:
( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SEy0k4GxMIEJEY4vCXDCqxOSUQJZ7uIUeA0nf-EleMw/viewform?edit_requested=true )

Hello all,

Is there anyone who is using Google Chromebook? If yes, then kindly share
your experiences.

What I researched about Chromebook is that we can't install anything on it.
Then how can it be a good choice for a developer or techie who do some
coding or researching day-in day-out?

It means Chromebook is good only for web surfing.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

Hi,

I am not speaking from technical point, but from moral point of view. 
Google likes to track and control Internet users. The first weapon it 
used was Chrome web browser and now Android and chrome book. To be or 
not to be digitally free is your choice.

Its based on chrome OS which mosly serves browsing needs with max
ability to install extensions and some carry offline support.

You were right in being default .But chromebook could be used to
install GNU/Linux on it .
http://www.chromebook-linux.com/2011/11/how-to-install-gnulinux-on-your-html.html
https://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/764181-how-to-install-linux-on-an-acer-c720-chromebook/
http://www.geek.com/apps/hps-chromebook-11-is-even-better-with-ubuntu-installed-1574172/

There are countless articles online , just search the right one for
your model and distro.

Final word is that google somehow subsidises thanks to OEM deals and
give us a sleek device , why not run GNU/Linux on it !

Hi Prasanna/Shakthi

I had been working on the problem and found a solution.

a) rmmod usbhid
b) insmod hello.ko
c) Hot plugin the keyboard, the module probe logs were available in syslog.

I am not able to think of better solution.

I had posted my problem on the linux newbie mailing list and got
myself banned from "challenge" since one of the rules is not
to post on public domain which i forgot, no more
new task for me.

?http://eudyptula-challenge.org/?

?What are the rules?

There aren't any, with the exception that you really should be doing your
own work. This challenge is for you, not anyone else, so don't ask about
how to solve them on mailing lists or IRC. Posting answers to the questions
online is also frowned apon, as it really doesn't help anyone out.

Also, we can tell if you are cheating, we have our ways...

Hi,

 I have setup a POC for integrating Samba4 AD DC with realmd/sssd using
Docker.

 If you have Docker installed and you are familiar with the technology it
won't take you more than 15 minutes to get working client/server.

 Here is the server (docker-dc) [1], and here is the client (docker-realmd)
[2]

Message-ID: <CAAS+GHOH_CC0Vq6sDANpNk1PEe_5gze6EnBzb5AmqYmgrXNgXQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Need volunteers to translate 525 english strings to tamil used by
Pressbooks website.

*About Pressbooks:* PressBooks is an open source book content management
system (built on WordPress) which exports in multiple formats: ebooks,
webbooks, print-ready PDF, and various XML flavours.

While using Pressbooks website to create epub version of project madurai
books, it was observed that the standard words appeared in english in the
generated book, like copyright, title, author etc. Pressbooks has support
for non english languages. They need the localized versions of their
application strings.

Localisation will achieve the following:
1) Generated ebooks will be totally in tamil.
2) UI of the website will be in tamil. (This is secondary but nice to have)

*Project status:* ongoing

*How to participate:*

1) Pressbooks application strings are hosted in http://transifex.com .
Register youself at transifex and request to join the translation team for
tamil for the project at https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/pressbooks/

2) Contact me off list so we can co ordinate and drive it to finish

Thank you!

Regards,
Arun

Hey Shrini,

What is the method you follow for regular printer?
For Telugu, the pdf was converted to high resolution image pdf. The book
came out good. Let me know if you get right printer at Chennai. I have
loads of books for print.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) gives a free micro instance for one year.
They have several images of various Linux distros.  I am sure Ubuntu
14.04  AMI (Amazon Machine Image).   Caveat to create an account you
will have to pop out a credit card.

Digital Ocean also provides a minimum VPS with 512MB RAM and single
vCPU @ $5/mo.

YMMV, since you have not given any details about your project.

Sorry. missed the project details.
The project is something like virtual network labs(emualtes network
devices), using NFV technology. For development , i am using LXC. Hence, i
need to run multple lxc containers inside(probably 20+) .
So minimum 4GB ram and decent CPU is required.

Thanks

Hi,


Elaborate your problem, is that the software is not executing correctly or
you get the window and not the camera output on the window.

Please tell what machine you are using, a laptop or desktop and what camera
are you using.

Sometime back, I had problem with the camera output not coming, that is
because of the loose conduct with the connectivity between the components
in my laptop.

regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

You could have done a google search to find out. I had a similar issue
after Ubuntu upgrade. It is realted to gstreamer cache. Removing the cache
(google for it) should solve the issue.

To: Chennai Python User Group Mailing List <chennaipy at python.org>


= August Month Meet

== Date & Time

23rd August
3:00pm to 5:00pm

== Venue

Zilogic Systems,
Fourth Main Road,
Kamaraj Nagar,
Thiruvanmiyur,
Chennai

Location map: http://www.zilogic.com/contact.html

== Agenda

Talk: Unit Tests with Nose
Speaker: Vengatesh
Duration: 20 min

Unit tests make your Python modules robust and maintainable. And a
framework that will simplify the creation and execution of unit tests
is always welcome. This talk will cover the basics of writing,
discovering and executing unit tests using the Nose framework.

https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/


Talk: API Documentation with Sphinx and Napoleon
Speaker: Aadhithyan
Duration: 20 min

Sphinx is the documentation tool of choice for several open source
projects, including Python, Bazar, SQLAlchemy and Django. This talk
will show how to generate beautiful API documentation for your Python
modules, using Sphinx and the Napoleon plugin. The Napoleon plugin
enhances Sphinx with the ability to generate API docs for modules,
that follow Google's elegant docstring format.

http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
pyguide.html?showone=Comments
https://readthedocs.org/projects/sphinxcontrib-napoleon/

Talk: Introduction to Brython
Speaker: Vijay Kumar
Duration: 30 min

Brython stands for "Browser Python". Brython is a Python to Javascript
compiler, written in Javascript. Brython allows us to do client-side
web programming using Python instead of Javascript! This talk will
take you through the process of writing a simple in-browser game
program, in Python.

If you would like to give a lightning talk, just come prepared, we
will be able to accommodate you.

If you are new to Python, the tutorial at
http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/ will give you a quick
overview of what Python is all about.

Regards,
Vijay

hi sandeep,

few points

#1 never hijack a discussion

#2 do not top post

#3 Use google/any serach engine for finding the fix (this is called home
work), use mailing list as the last resort to get solution.

#4  if you need solution from the mailing list, start a new thread and
request for solution, support the list with full description of your
problem,the reported error and the urls on the net which is closely
associated with your problem. never barge into an on going discussion
/thread.

HTH

I have a completely customised Debian and ubuntu installation(Normal
installation) in my external hard-disk. I can add or remove or update
the packages from anywhere I have an internet connection.

Now I want to install the same system to another I want to by using
the installer. I can I do this?

I couldn't understand the following links:-

https://www.debian.org/releases/etch/i386/ch05s01.html.en

Message-ID: <53fb0c42.c531460a.36ba.fffff9e6@mx.google.com>

Us being a very compassionate bunch at PyCon India, we can't bear to
see people coming to us and saying they missed buying tickets and
asking whether there is anything they could do to attend the event.
Unfortunately, the conference venue itself has a limit of ~1000
attendees, we won't be able to fit more people in.

Getting to the point, the ticket sales are nearing its very end.  Both
in terms of time and quantity.  Seriously.  There are only a few left
in both the Regular registration as well as Student registration
category.  First come, first serve.  So, if you really want to come
for PyCon India 2014, which absolutely is something that you don't
want to miss, then buy your tickets now! Right now!

http://pyconindia2014.doattend.com/

Assuming we have tickets left, regular and student registrations will
remain open till 31st August, midnight.  From September 1st onwards
there will only be a single category of ticket priced at Rs. 1500.

See you there!

Hi

What is the problem, remember you have not spelled your problem, please
copy the error to the mailing list.


>>>>please anyone provide me perfect solution.

There is no silver spoon treatment here, there are 2 ways here

1) do the home work and report the error and request people for solution.
                                       (or)
2) Hire a professional here who will help you.

If the installation is required to be exactly same and the second external disk is of same size, why can't you use dd?

dd If=/dev/source of=/dev/target

I can't opine about use of Debian installer.

As we continue to iterate on new ubuntu touch images, it's important
for everyone to be able to enjoy the ubuntu phone experience in their
native language. So we need translations! If you've never contributed
a translation before, this is a perfect opportunity for you to learn.
To help with that, I spruced up the guide David started a bit ago;
please feel free to edit or add on to it as well:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/Phone

Grab your phablet device, emulator, or even desktop and have a look at
the image with your language set to your native tongue (or something
else you can understand). Look for holes in translations and report
them, or even better, fix them by providing a translation. The guide
covers translating and links you to all the core apps and indicators.

FYI, David also keeps a stats page for each language you can reference:

http://projects.davidplanella.org/stats/utopic/

Happy Translating everyone!

Nicholas

Dear all
Thanks to Shrini for the fine job during  last few years.
Welcome to Gowtham Ram.

We should seriously rethink on our meetings as the attendance is too
thin. We need to attract more students to our meet.

The SFD is due in few weeks. Let us do something to celebrate.

Great article. But I wish some one writes about the stresses faced in 
today's I.T industry too. One must know that todays industry is not 
about engineering achievement, but mostly about bowing to  the stupidity 
of those who control money. Of the 12 years I have coded, I can only say 
that I roughly enjoyed a tiny fraction of it.

Yes writing nice about something is good, but I feel one must know the 
inner workings, politics, and garbage that this industry has 
accumulated. Thats where I think true journalism lies.

Just a question: How many I.T workers are really happy people? Why?

Subject: [Ilugc] Book Review : i want 2 do project. tell me wat 2 do.
Message-ID: <CAND2796-=Y4EYhjTij6Gyzjky4TgST7_eFwqB7CAb15uj5Tf_w@mail.gmail.com>

The book "I want 2 do project. tell me wat 2 do." is an excellent guide for
any student to get into the Free/Open Source Software world.

The students have tons of queries when asked to do a project, themselves.
Though they know the basics of few programming languages, they usually
don't do any programs themselves. They just copy/paste from others and
found it is very difficult, when they have to do some programming
themselves.

This book encourages the students to self learn new things and make their
hands dirty with programming.
This is not a book to teach any language. All the programming books stop
with teaching programming.
But this books begins from where they stop.

Students need to learn many stuff after programming. The communication with
others and self discipline are the key strengths they should have. This
books explains them well.


Shakthi Kannan, explains the following concepts

Mailing list guidelines
Programming language guidelines
Contacting mentors
Logging learning activities
The problems on continuous learning and how to overcome them
how to create and do presentations
how to concentrate on the basics
Various phases of Computer Science Skills
The Tools available for project development and contribution
Keep on growing the projects
and more.


I recommend this book for all the computer science students. Learning does
not stops with college. If you are working and interested in contributing
to Free/Open Software, this book is for you. Start with this book, follow
all the tips and guidelines. You will become a rockstar contributor for
your favourite Free/Open Source Software.

Teachers are the big inspirations for the students. I recommend this book
for all the lecturers/professors to read and contribute for any Free/Open
Source software, ask their students to contribute.


The quotes in each chapter are much impressive. They show the hard work
behind finding them and placing in proper places. The friendly writing
style makes the book, easy to read and follow.

You can buy the book at the following links.

There are many tech events conducted by many groups in chennai.
ILUGC is one among them.

IoT enthusiasts conduct their own meetings.

I just share the other meeting info here.
But, these events are free for all like ILUGC meets.

If you are interested, just attend.

The topics spoken possibly. Other than that nothing. Ilugc conducts 
meeting without any monetary or any other self interests. Companies 
conduct meetings to gain popularity, attract talent, get visibility.. 
... blah blah or because they truly love technology. Who knows?

Ilugc is the mother of all these meetups. Though we people at ilugc 
smack each other now and then, each member of this group has very great 
respect for other. And most of ilugc people love free technology for the 
sake of goodness. Thats where ilugc leads.

Attend an ilugc meet and you will know. It has changed my life.

Message-ID: <CACqv84je27_1CbT6j=ipU5m-gOzKyKRDR+2W2EHARfo6qp=-yA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Geeks,

Good morning,


Just have a quick question, do we have any software in open source which
can function same as phone factor( 2 way authentication) or DUO security ?

Don't tell me google authenticator ! , M not looking out for that.

Just some insight of what M looking out for:-

We need 2 factor auth not by just entering the pin, but to dail a phone
number and confirming.

I have googled a lot and even had a call  with the RED HAT tech people, but
no luck :(...

If any one has done this configuration, requesting you to please guide me
so that the same can be taken over in our envi.

Thanks,
Sathya.R

why is that there is no single best operating system for devices?

why all the human time, energy and resources have to be split into android,
windows, tizen, firefox, nokia OS and so on?

will the mobile OS war help the consumer who is free to put his OS in his
phone?

This is possibly a multi-step verification rather than 2-factor
authentication. Multi-factor authentication is essentially a 2 out of
3 approach of the following - (i) something the end user has; (ii)
something the end user knows; and (iii) something that only the end
user is

I sincerely hope the device is good.

But looking at the specs simple logic says unless the firefox os does some
magic the user experience is not going to be that great. I wish to be be
proved wrong. I am going to order for that device anyways to experiment. I
have an android smart phone with low internal storage and low memory and it
is virtually unusable as a smart phone. Works great as a phone though. I am
not stupid to expect something like an iPhone or an S3 at Rs.2,000/- but
worried about the os's reputation running on such cheap hardware.

IF the experience is not good (we don't know yet), can't believe that
Mozilla would do something as stupid as this. Cheap is cheap. I remember
the proliferation of android devices on cheap unbranded Chinese phones
which got 'android' a cheap tag - bad battery, bad display, not responsive
etc. Consumers do not know to differentiate between hardware shortfalls and
the os. If Mozilla thought by partnering with a local company and throw a
cheap phone at us Indians it is rather sad. They could have atleast
demanded to have one good spec device in parallel. The phone in question
does not have 3G connectivity and the rather uninformed consumer will
comment to a friend 'firefox os cannot do 3G and they call it a smart phone
OS'.

Arun

Message-ID: <CAPmBbRgzS8PfVgFdXmx0ZE0zzwFqOatBtfaV-oqBk8LTq1MbUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have implemented Zabbix 2.2 on OpenSuSE (Virtual Appliance). Its working
well, I have downloaded a perl script from forums to monitor processes of
windows servers to which process taking how much load. when I execute the
script I am getting following error.

# perl lld_all_graph.pl
Scalar found where operator expected at lld_all_graph.pl line 62, near
"$dec"
        (Missing semicolon on previous line?)
syntax error at lld_all_graph.pl line 62, near "$dec "

I do not have any perl scripting knowledge. I have searched in forum that I
need to check URL and PASSWORD. The URL and PASSWORD are correct ( using
default credentials).

The steps i have taken is as follows
#chmod +x lld_all_graph.pl
#chmod +x list_items.pl
#dos2unix lld_all_graph.pl
#dos2unix list_items.pl

I am giving scripts urls please guide me where I am doing wrong.

You don't specifically mention the issues which require attention. It
would be difficult for the readers on the list to provide input.

A semicolon is missing in line 62 i.e
 return $dec_out

Change this to
return $dec_out;

It is not there in line 62 but the following is there.
$dec = decode_json($res);

in line no.92 the following is there
return $dec_out

I have modified it to
return $dec_out;

Still the same error i am getting.

Request you to help me out.

 Dear all,

Just heard from Prof. Kannan Moudgalya that Spoken Tutorials (
http://spoken-tutorial.org/) has moved to CC BY-SA 4.0 . It was using
CC-BY-NC-ND 3.0 earlier which is non free

Congrats Prof. Kannan and team for changing spoken tutorials as OER
repository

Now this opens room for many FOSS projects like us to prepare and host
local language tutorials of FOSS packages under a free license in Spoken
tutorials

The Spoken Tutorial project is the initiative of the ?Talk to a Teacher?
activity of the National Mission on Education through Information and
Communication Technology (ICT), launched by the Ministry of Human Resources
and Development, Government of India.

Looks like the script has lot of errors beyond simple syntax errors.
Beter to revert to the place where you got your script. Without
understanding the scripts purpose and logic it is difficult to suggest
a solution.

Nah, community members are expected to be mind readers :)

What is disappointing to note is that OP is already using openVPN AS
version, so that should give him some clue as to what he needs to do
on the CE version and/or articulate the current AS setup.  Sigh.

The next step I think is convergence. You can slide your phone into lap 
top like casing and your phone will power the laptop. Or plug it into 
HDMI port and it will act like a desktop. Ubuntu has done that, 
Microsoft is following and soon Android and Firefox will do it too.

Thank you for your subtle and most caring reply. It once again proves that
common sense is so uncommon..
P.S please do not use translating feature when you try to answer technical
questions.

Don't expect, everyone in this mail list is your chat friends to use

Hi,

Tamil Development Board (an autonomous institution under Government of
Tamilnadu) releases its Encyclopedia (10 volumes, 7407 pages) and
Children's Encyclopedia (10 volumes, 969 pages) under Creative Commons
license. Tamil Wikipedians lead by Prof. C. R. Selvakumar and Prof. P. R.
Nakkeeran, (Director, Tamil Virtual Academy) spearheaded this initiative
coinciding with Tamil Wikipedia's 10 years celebrations.

An official confirmation (in Tamil) can be seen at

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Letter_from_Tamil_Development_Board_donating_20_volumes_of_encyclopedia_in_Tamil_under_Creative_Commons_license.jpeg

Scanned copies of these works are already available at

http://tamilvu.org/library/kulandaikal/lku00/html/lku00ind.htm

At Tamil Wikipedia, we are discussing how we can get this content typed and
transferred to WikiSource. Doing so can be a good model to encourage more
such works to be released in public domain.

Following are two options I can think of:

1. Volunteers type all the content. Besides taking years to complete, this
won't do justice for the value of time of volunteers who can do more
valuable work than typing mechanically.

A program like IT at School present in Kerala or a contest can encourage more
people to join this effort but not all communities can't emulate this model
successfully.

2. Request WMF to give a grant to the owner of the content and let them
hand over the typed content to Wikisource volunteers who will upload and
wikify the content.

This will ensure maintaining the spirit of volunteerism and yet getting the
work done in a professional and time bound manner.

Numerous works in Wikisource are such ready made content uploaded already
in the web through other projects like Project Gutenberg.

If providing grants to non-Wikimedia organizations is an issue, a grant
towards this can be given to community / chapter who will then outsource
the typing work.

I welcome community's input on any other model for this as India has vast
amount of literature and works like this are waiting to be transfered to
Wikisource. This is one area where we can add lot of content to Wiki
projects at once.

Ravi

Hi Baiju Muthukadan,

As all workshop ticket is sold out, is there any chance of getting on-spot
ticket for pycon2014 workshop.

Thanking You.
With Regards.

Hi Ajith,

Workshop has limited seats. So I don't think it will be possible. Sorry.

Dear Knights;
I am in the process of installing Debian with LXDE, the root account boots

Some help please.
