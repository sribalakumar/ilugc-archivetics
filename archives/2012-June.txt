Message-ID: <CADDQFRtRL+KysHr6RX2W3wh_Dwkhz3Mg6DKtG3J+_GW1wpbVHw@mail.gmail.com>

The judgement goes like:
"The overall name tree, of course, has creative elements but it is
also a precise command structure ? a utilitarian and functional set of
symbols, each to carry out a pre-assigned function. This command
structure is a system or method of operation under Section 102(b) of
the Copyright Act and, therefore, cannot be copyrighted. Duplication
of the command structure is necessary for interoperability....

Contrary to Oracle, copyright law does not confer ownership over any
and all ways to implement a function or specification, no matter how
creative the copyrighted implementation or specification may be. The
Act confers ownership only over the specific way in which the author
wrote out his version. Others are free to write their own
implementation to accomplish the identical function, for, importantly,
ideas, concepts and functions cannot be monopolized by copyright"

Subject: [Ilugc] How does download accelerator work?
Message-ID: <CALDskyyKnkvqZLSgJFs0Rh1sKfKmAjE-vuLPH6nyyu-yP5aHmg@mail.gmail.com>

A download accelerator speeds up the download but prevents others from
using the bandwidth fairly but still
 gets the job done for you. It is very useful just like Bittorrent or
other p2p technology.

We will first see how a download accelerator like axel or lftp with
certain switches work. Then we will see
 how p2p works.

A download accelerator uses multiple TCP connections for downloading
multiple file offsets and then joins them
 locally using file I/O seek calls.

Obviously this involves clever programming.

Multiple TCP connections can get you more bandwidth only in the local
LAN environment. But it cannot
 steal other's bandwidth on the Internet.

So there are limits to what a download accelerator can do.

This is the simple concept. Certain FTP and HTTP servers do not
support multiple simultaneous connections from
 the same IP, so this does not always work but in my experience I have
seen that it mostly works just fine.

Using multiple TCP connections in this situation is good; but we
cannot use it for improving performance all the time.

ssh uses just one TCP connection whilst FTP and others use many. ssh
is far more efficient and much more modern
 and thorough. By avoiding the overhead involved in setting up and
tearing down a connection ssh saves on a lot
 of overhead.

Whereas FTP sets up a separate connection for ls, get, put
commands(list files, download, upload) and this too it
 does in two directions. In one case it opens a new connection from
client to server(passive mode), in another
 server opens a connection to the client.

Overall FTP is old and is a big problem since today's environment is
full of NAT and firewalls.

Still FTP is widespread with no sign of dying down.

As to Windows file sharing it is extremely bandwidth intensive and it
does not matter in a LAN environment.

It is not TCP/IP aware. It works over a VPN but will be slow.

Alright, now let us understand how p2p file sharing protocols like
bittorrent scale.

Basically a busy server dishing out 100s of simultaneous downloads get
overloaded and it cannot serve new clients.

In order to address this bittorrent downloads between each other since
once you have a file or portions of a file
 you can always transfer between yourselves.

The only catch being that all are behind NAT and not servers. So you
need a method to download from a machine
 behind NAT. Bittorrent addresses that using the same technique skype
uses to initiate a connection to a NATed IP.

Hi

This may be know to many however I just discovered it today.  Many a days I
use to see my Switch blink which states that data transfer is going on
however I did not know which program was actually sending it, all that I
use to do was to type in netstat -antulp to know what are the established
connections.

Today I discovered that nethogs will show exactly what I wanted (i.e) group
the process which are currently active and which are transmitting over the
Ethernet\wireless.

#apt-get install nethogs
You need to start nethogs as root

Cool; learnt a new tool for the day :)

I have been using 'ntop' for many years - it gives a more global
picture i.e. of the entire LAN that is visible to the host it is
running on.

It has a nice WebUI and shows bandwidth usage by hosts and further
breakdown by protocols/services.

Also, tcpdump is handy for quick snapshot of traffic on the wire.

(caveat: this post is based mainly on personal experience and put here
to see how others in both the open source field and the proprietary
field feel about this)

thanks to all who responded. I now understand that the term is supposed
to mean the development cycle for a software project. This, in my
opinion, is radically different for foss and prop software. I have had
only 3 experiences in developing prop, and all ended up in my being
booted out fairly early in the process, so I am not sure if my
observations are accurate. The cycle as I see it is like this:

1. Sales meets the clients and promises them anything under the sun, fix
a price and get an agreement and an advance. After that sales is out of
the picture.

2. Design then meets the clients and draw up an elaborate set of specs
and get the client's approval. After that, design is out of the picture.

3. The design is then sent to production. The job is parceled out to
several teams, each team working in isolation from the other teams. I
will not go into how these teams operate, but the general atmosphere is
- if it works, it is fine and peer review and criticism of another's
code is seen as a deadly insult. Obviously a lot of the code is
duplicated as no team knows what the other teams are doing, and, no one
will anyway admit that another person's solution is better than his.
Note that the teams do not have any contact with the clients. When the
teams finish their assignments, most of the members move on to other
projects leaving a skeleton team to cope with the next stage.

4. Now the integration team moves in. They are the elite and highly paid
and their job is to somehow get everything to work together. They do a
lot of reverse engineering and 'adjustments' and finally pronounce
themselves satisfied. 

5. Then testing takes over - all tests are with simulated data and with
the help of the integrators the tests are pronounced done.

6. The product is then dumped on the hapless client and he is left to
the tender mercies of support. In the period of development, a lot of
his needs have changed and he needs many things he has not contracted
for. Also with real data, many bugs appear. Some clients decide to live
with it - others go to another vendor, and the same process starts
again. The client very often spends more to get the whole thing working
in some fashion or the other than on the original application.

note that the tools used are irrelevant to the process. Of course people
will say that these practices are only followed by lowlifes, and good
software developers use a lot of open source tools and methods and are
very scientific in their approach. So let us look at IBM. Produces great
software, is ethical and a very sound supporter of open source. Some
years back a wildly hilarious discussion went on in the django
developers mailing list. The thread is here:
http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/80f73f8bbf93c039/d598b3d4d67301a8?#d598b3d4d67301a8

To summarise the thread, IBM wanted to release Django drivers for their
databases, so they asked the Django developers for the 'specs'. The
reply: download django, make a copy of an existing driver, tweak it for
your database, make sure it passes all the tests and you have a driver.
IBM was horrified - we cannot download or even look at your code as our
engineers will get tainted and we can no longer use them - so give us
specs. The django team was not willing to waste their time on this.
Eventually IBM released the drivers. I suppose they got some engineer to
look at the code, write the specs and then they must have terminated him
with extreme prejudice ;-) When pharaoh died, he was buried with all his
wealth. The tomb was cleverly constructed with a lot of booby traps to
prevent looters from getting in. Often the location was secret. And the
architects, builders and slaves who built the tomb were killed and
buried with him - all in the name of secrecy and security. Prop software
has two constraints - one cannot reuse code (even code written by the
concern for another client) and one cannot let all and sundry see the
whole of the code base - so these 'developers' do not know whether they
are dealing with an elephant or a donkey. (it is usually a donkey)

I have also had some experience where the client has agreed that the
application be developed as open source. Since secrecy is no longer an
issue, The same team does everything from sales to support, and the
client and his employees are also members of the team. The process is
something like this:

1. Meet the client and convince him to take your app and also have it
developed as open source. Take advance and make the agreement. Make sure
that the person who actually takes the decisions is on board, otherwise
you are wasting your time.

2. Identify a key area to work on and set up a *loose* set of specs -
this is going to change anyway. It is crucial that this key area is
relatively fast to set up as this will be used to get the client's
people up to speed on the open source way of doing things.

3. Discuss everything on a mailing list where all stakeholders can
participate.

4. Write the module - note that anyone writing any of the code has to
also write the tests and make sure the code passes the tests and also
works with the existing code base. This eliminates the testing phase and
there is no need for an integrator. Also the code should be well
commented and documented, which eliminates the need to get people to
write manuals.

5. Install the module for the client and ask them to start feeding real
data and to start using the module in production as soon as possible.

6. Insist that all problems be reported as issues in the bug tracker and
train the client how to do this - it is not rocket science. Make sure
all issues are dealt with as soon as possible. At least the issues
should be accepted/rejected immediately and frequently updated until
resolution. This is the most important point - training the client to be
a co-developer.

7. Do not focus on look and feel at this stage, but be very flexible on
making changes and doing things that were not initially contracted for.
The client may think he knows what he wants, but usually a lot of this
is based on his experience with doing things manually - computers do not
do things the way people do. Once the client realises this, he is
hooked. Once the initial module is in production, and the team is
comfortable working together, the rest of the work can be done in the
same manner.

8. Writing code: first check your own code base and then the web for
suitable code - make sure it is legal to use it, and then copy, paste
and tweak. Roll your own only if nothing suitable is available. For code
from your own app, the tweaks may be applicable to the original too -
and that is an improvement. Everything should be documented on the
mailing list/bug tracker/wiki, both before and after writing the code.
Of course various members of the team will have specific
responsibilities, but anyone is free to work on any part of the code
(make sure people who cannot be trusted not to mess up everything are
not given commit rights on the main repo - they should fork and make
changes there which can be pulled when checked out by a person with
commit rights. 

8. The team will have a structure, but usually no real hierarchy. Of
course you need a person to take final and binding decisions in matters
where there is no consensus. Get rid of anyone who is unable to stomach
criticism of his code - however brilliant he may be. And remember that
ui/ux cannot be done by a committee - entrust this to one person and
leave the decisions to him.

9. When in production, backward compatibility is good, but not an
inflexible rule. When it is broken make sure that all migration scripts
are committed at the same time as the change.

10. At some stage, you may require a users mailing list and to
coordinate all the documentation into a manual - this manual should
practically write itself. 

11. If you are lucky, some geeks will appear on the client's side who
start contributing to the project - and if you are really lucky,
outsiders who find the app useful may also start participating.

There is a lot more to be said, but basically this is what I feel is the
difference between open and prop - feedback on other's experiences and
flames are most welcome.

Subject: [Ilugc] How are appliances created and used/sold?
Message-ID: <CALDskyyGeoQwejoG5ANqSKKoRERCiBqBtLVcSNuVZAYk3buDdw@mail.gmail.com>

Since I am an appliance guy I thought I will dwell on the topic that
took a long time
 to mature and even now I am not sure if I am doing the right things.

An appliance is an OS. An OS image with everything built into it.

We find that LiveCDs are used to demonstrate something like a digital
audio workstation
 or even networking.

That is an appliance but not really so.

A LiveCD is an optical image and it cannot save any information. So it
is usually used as a
 conduit to install an appliance.

That is what I do to sell or distribute my products.

You need a bootable optical medium like  LiveCD to install the
appliance to a hard disk.

Then the hard disk is booted and you have sold an appliance.

The OS is self contained with everything; the software packages, the
web server, the web panel
 inside it, the backend that does all the real hard work and so on.

As you can see a LiveCD is a great way to distribute your physical
appliance worldwide.

However you have to ensure that the physical appliance on which the
LiveCD installs the binary
 image is compatible with your release.

The other form of appliance is a VM or virutal machine.

When it comes to virtualization VMWare wins hands on and qemu wins in
the open source arena.

Linux people know qemu as KVM.

Anyway VirtualBox is another choice too.

These things run on all OSes for free.

So if you want to show your great UNIX OS appliance to a Windows user,
all they have to do is
 run this thing inside a VMWare or a VirtualBox VM.

You can directly distribute VMWare images on your website and that is
a software appliance.

It is exactly like connecting a physical machine to your network if
the appliance is configured to
 use bridged mode networking.

You can test a wide variety of networking products without wasting
hardware resources.

Just install a firewall VM or a VPN VM or a mail server VM on a
Windows VMware player.

And you can get going.

In fact a lot of companies do just that I think though I don't have data.

Do we have any such event in chennai?

Can we simulate in stellarium?

If anyone can simulate in stellarium, please provide the steps to reproduce.
It will be a nice learning stuff for astronomy through stellarium.

Hi friends,

FSMK invites you to join us on watching Transit of Venus on June 6th from
6:30 am to 10:00 am at Lalbagh Hilltop. This is a public event and everyone
is welcome to join us and enjoy this life time opportunity. The next
transit of venus will happen only after 105 years.

As a run-up event, FSMK is also conducting the screening of the
documentary, Transit of Venus and Day sky watching, on Sunday 3:00 pm on
June 3rd. This will be followed by a discussion on various experiments that
can be conducted during the transit and Dr. Sanjeev, ISRO scientist will
guide us through the experiments.
Please do join us with your friends and family and enjoy this beautiful
event of our solar system.

FSMK is conducting the event with the motto "Learn Astronomy, Say no to
Astrology."

You can find the pamphlet for the program here,
http://www.fsmk.org/sites/default/files/venus-transit-pamphlet.png

Also please note that watching the sun directly with naked eye is harmful
for your eyes. We have obtained goggles using which you can safely watch
the transit. If you are not able to join us on 6th, you can come to FSMK
office on 3rd June at 3:00 pm during the documentary screening and buy the
goggles. Goggles cost Rs. 10 only and they have been prepared by Navnirmiti
and certified for safely viewing the sun.

Please do visit, http://www.fsmk.org/node/102 for getting more info related
to the event.

More info about Transit of Venus:
What is the Transit of Venus(ToV):
On the 6th June 2012, the planet venus will pass across the face of the Sun
and this is called a Venus Transit. It is among that rarest of planetary
alignments and only 7 of them have happened since the invention of the
telescope. They happen after more than a century in a pair with 8 years in
between them. The years of previous ones have been 1631 and 1639, then 1761
and 1769, followed by 1874 and 1882 and then finally 2004 which was the
opener to a pair which will see the second event in 2012.

Why ToV is an important event?
The ToV is important because at the time of the ToV any school child can
measure how far is the sun. Many great astronomers and scientists,
including Isaac Newton, longed to see this event in their life time but
could not. We are fortunate to have this event occurring in our life time.
Its the last chance to see a rare astronomical event of this kind in this
century. The next transit will happen and can be seen only after 105 years.

Can we see the ToV?
Yes, anyone and everyone can see it easily with a little preparation! You
view it and encourage others to see it too! You can even to important
experiments which are the first steps do knowing how big is the universe.

HI ,
As an ex- employee of this company it is a good place to learn many 
technologies. you will get ample exposure to learn different 
technologies.. but I dont recommend this company for long run or a 
career grwoth.
1. You will not get what you are offered.( apart from the tax deduction 
they have a item called " variable component" which takes 40- 50% of 
your total package. This is directly connected to your performance. even 
if you meet up all the KRA parameters ( which is unachievable for a 
normal employee) eg; if your package is 3.6 L/annuam you are expecting 
30k after all the mandatory deductions.. but you get only 22 k ,rest 
will go off since you didn't meet the KRA  of that month
2.There will not be any career growth. I still know few of my friends 
who are in the same grade for more than 6 years. you need to have good 
rapport with the management to get a good hike as well
3. Though the company provides Free transport ( by words) you need to 
bear a part of the transport cost . if you are not using the cab for a 
day you will be fined 100 Rs per instance.which is another deduction 
from your monthly take home.

Very good job Joseph.

Such democratic help is what makes an advanced society work.

I much appreciate the tone of the mail, the intent and the maturity.

Lot of people I know cannot handle this so well.

You said what you wanted to say in a manner that reaches people.

Good.

ILUGC allows job posting in the interest of FOSS job seekers though it is OT. Please do not misuse this facility for passing judgement about any individual/companies.

You should have stopped your email at this first paragraph, it is short 
and conveys your message. Every company has someone or the other who has 
faced problems. It should be shared/discussed in an objective manner in 
the appropriate mailing lists.

Subject: [Ilugc] What companies look for in engineers
Message-ID: <CALDskyyAqtG-upDjHC3VgocybZrw3G5gTGwbOwrm6gzBPev+4w@mail.gmail.com>

Unfortunately today our nation is so full of the American MBA bullshit
ideology that people
 no longer  look at technology and engineering as being viable and
honorable options to
 do well in life.

Although a majority of Califorinian Silicon Valley successes are
engineered by our gene pool
 people still in India, to make money and do well in life one ought to
be not so technical.

The "not so technical" types I come across often here turn out to also
not respect engineers and
 engineering talent.

However if you are of a different bent of mind and if you enjoy
technology, programming and
 knowledge in general then this mail may interest you.

Good software companies which are very few worldwide look for certain
characteristics in
 engineers.

What are they?

The first thing is talent. A sound academic track record is good.
Since this is all about knowledge and
 brain power, how well you have done in life and what habits you have
to focus and do things
 in a disciplined way is proven by good academics.

However it is a fact that most people who do well in life are very
poor at scoring grades.

If you are a topper the odds are stacked against you to do well. This
is largely due to the fact that
 life is not a straight forward affair of merit and living in one's
comfort zone.

One needs a lot of  adaptation skills in particular dealing with
failure gracefully , maturity and wisdom.

We get to the second point now.

Engineers companies look for have to have the willingness to
constantly learn, try out new things,
 expand beyond their comfort zone and horizons and rise up to the
changing needs of the business.

Then you need people who are mature enough not to write everything
from scratch, who can tolerate
 other people well and who can patiently work and wait for rewards in
the form of salary raises or
 promotions.

All this growing up takes time. With experience you get all that.

In an interview if you ask for high salary that is acceptable but your
goal in life should not be only money.

HR people are somewhat cranky and they usually have personality
defects; they may have a disdain for
 the high salaries that engineers make; so you have to be bit careful
in dealing with them.

Don't sound arrogant and confident. It is a tough game. You have to
play it right.

Now getting a job is a lot more than qualities.

It is also politics. But we can't change that.

What we can change is the attitude part.

In general good English skills are necessary to grow up in any sector
not just IT.

I repeatedly find excellent language skills in all the higher echelons
of companies.

Moreover for companies like mine this is a must since I am very
particular about correctness being
 a programmer myself. I cannot tolerate silly grammatical errors and
spelling mistakes.

And we are mostly dealing with Westerners here who have very little
patience with English errors.

So you should focus on improving your written and spoken English skills.

Ability to deliver work is another factor. But this is largely s
subjective issue.

How you work and how quickly you can handle change and adapt to
situations is what matters.

Overall the quality that people look for can be summed up as
competence. Which is a little bit
 of all of the above.

Subject: [Ilugc] How does load balancing work?
Message-ID: <CALDskyyTGw8zP5JzFzaY=10pHneqgCewuF_DsR0no=Pqr3_JMQ@mail.gmail.com>

There are multiple kinds of load balancers.

Multiple levels of load balancing.

It can be at layer 2, it can be at layer 7 or it can be one of the
several other possibilities.

Load balancing involves promising a 100% uptime for a server application.

The server application could be a web server, mail server, database
server, CVS server,
 Windows file sharing server anything.

The load balancing idea is from the data center hosting world but it
can very well be used in a
 tightly controlled local environment.

It is not unusual for software to crash, for hardware to lose life and
of course for power to go away.

In such situations we can always fail over to another setup in which
the same application is available.

If you are using VPN technology this failover can be made worldwide
using a remote setup.

Then it is called as DRS or something.

Okay now let us take a look at a typical scenario.

If your firewall/router fails what do you do?

You are in a soup.

If your ISP WAN load balancer fails what do you do?

You are in a soup.

If your DB server goes down again, yes you are in a soup.

So what gives?

It is possible to do failover or service redirection in a variety of ways.

It can be made application independent, it can be application
dependent, it can be stateless or with state.

Many different ways exist.

But for the most common case, CARP or common address redundancy
protocol would do.

This is an adaptation of the Cisco VRRP protocol in which a virtual IP
address maps to a master
 and a slave IP address.

If you ping the CARP IP, one of the machines in the CARP cluster will respond.

Yes, clustering is a concept related to all this again from a data center world.

You can also do load balancing in the layer 7 in which an application
is redundancy aware.

Or simple DNS round robin or whatever else.

You can redirect HTTP requests using cookies or header patterns.

You can do what is known as DSR which is a direct server return in
which the routing is
 asymmetric.

Packets reaching the server and on the way back follow different routes.

This is not recommended but may be useful.

Definitely for NAT and address rewriting like port forwarding to work
routing has to
 be symmetric.

Most of the problems I have faced in my networking career are due to
asymmetric routing
 in a local LAN.

No.   It gives an overview of network traffic on the LAN.  I did not

Yes.   I did not mean to imply that is a replacement for nethogs.

Load balancing only eliminates downtime due to server/application
being a single point of failure.

Even with full redundancy it's still not possible to provide 100%
uptime for any application. You may be sharing the same ethernet
switch, ISP connection, etc. In the very least the clustering software
is a single point of failure. If VRRP breaks then you'll end up with
a multi-master scenario where your cluster stop working.

CARP is primarily on BSD. VRRP is no longer Cisco proprietary, many
vendors support VRRP and some even add their own enhancements.
You could in theory cluster routers from different vendors using VRRP
but I have never seen it in practice.

If you mention load balancing and clustering, it's essential to differentiate
between active/active clustering and active/standby clustering. In an A/A
cluster all members accept load from clients, in an A/S cluster, only the
active node is servicing requests while the standby node is not servicing
any requests. Only when the active node fails, the standby node is brought
into service. VRRP is A/S only.

Web and application servers can be easily A/A clustered. Most databases
are A/S. You'll need something like Oracle RAC, shared storage, etc to
make your DB A/A. IIRC MySQL, Postgre, Microsoft SQL server, etc are
all A/S.

CARP on a LAN is different from CARP on WAN (through a router). Key
difference is that CARP on WAN will need all inbound traffic to be received
by all nodes. This is because ARP load balancing cannot be done if
all traffic is forwarded by your local router. I can't think of many situations
where servers are deployed in the same subnet as clients, so OS clustering
is not a scalable load balancing architecture.

CARP also requires L2 switches to support "multi-port static MAC" or
no L3 switches "multi-port static ARP" in order to forward all inbound
traffic to all cluster nodes. Not all switches support this.

To overcome these limitations, nearly all large deployments use
dedicated L7 load balancers and do not depend on OS clustering.

This is very useful in a situation where the application downloads
lot of data to the client but there's very little upload. Eg. YouTube like
video streaming - client sends a small HTTP request, server returns
several MB of data. Avoiding the load balancer in the return path
reduces load and you can spec a lower bandwidth appliance and
reduce cost.


Load balancing and clustering is very interesting technology and is
quickly becoming an essential requirement for many organizations.
Great that you decided to write about it.

Every developer had to write a high level design document (interfaces,
db, real time requirements etc.) which got broken into Design Units
(Code). The DU doc had pseudo code and/or flow charts showing how each
C function would work.

Each document was reviewed by peers and senior members.   The document
would not be accepted until major/severe bugs were resolved.   Ditto
with DU - Code could not deviate from that mentioned in the DU docwent
through inspection and  walk through by peers and module owners.
Again, code not be submitted for integration until all errors were
resolved.   This does not mean that the entire system was bug free but
the philosophy was to catch as many bugs before they crept into the
system.

Every developer had access to *all* the code in *all* the sub systems
- no code duplication.   Peers suggested code improvements during the
inspection stage (I learnt a few tricks in C from peers this way).

Project management meetings were tough; managers would ask tough
technical questions (they knew the product).
Coming from this background, I was appalled at the practices in other
companies that you have succinctly outlined.

Message-ID: <CAFHFDAmvgHKr5P_rhpTK4o8qxt4dsPpvZ0XQDSi_QodGUU_5Rg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I had started using Ubuntu as my main OS and of late I have seen while
booting 10.04 it just shows a black screen I have to press the power button
once again and then power button once again to get it up an running, I
browsed the net and landed on the link which is shown below.  They have
asked me to replace quite and splash with nomodeset, which I did and my
ubuntu does boot up, however while booting up now it shows lots of text
scrolling past the screen while it is booting.  Is this normal ?  Since the
OS shows black screen almost once in a day I need to wait for a couple of
more days to know for sure if it is completely fixed.

It is normal to see the scrolling text. Only in the last 5 years, they 
have added the splash image. Personally, I prefer the text to make sure 
all services have started up okay.

If you are up for some experimentation, you can try to set the value to,

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="nomodeset quiet"

and see what happens. Without a splash image, I don't know what you will 
see on boot up.

I haven't used ubuntu much, so, it is hard for me to understand the 
problem. But, if this is because of boot screen resolution, you can try 
changing vga in kernel boot options. I use vga=791 ie., 1024x768 16-bit 
for my boot screen. You can find some details here,

We can have this as a backup plan.

But still, reaching out the public will be more fruitful.

I request all members to check with their offices too.
If offices are ready hold the events, we can have multiple release parties.

Hi,

I came to know that Ramadoss (amachu) has planned very well and cheated his
ex. employees (around 7 members) by not paying their three/four months
salary.

Some of them told that every actions done by him was well planned to do the
same.  I came to know that the Amachu Infrasoft Services Limited was
Ramadoss's fourth company and now he was also planning to close the same.

Of course some of his co-workers in his previous company told the same
about him.

Please don't post these type of ad mails, it may affect the genuinity of
the ILUGC mailing list.

You can setup a VPN connection to a US machine and browse the sites. ;)

Being in Security field I need not go that far, however I would love to
know what is the reason behind blocking the same.  I want to be ethical in
what ever I do :-)

If there is a link which states this is the reason why these are blocked I
would love it.

Thank you so much for your concern. But, don't make such personal attacks

Hi Karthick,

Whatever you said is true. I am one of the person cheated by him. I worked
for Amachu Infrasoft Services Limited for about one and a half year. He has
to pay me 5 months salary. When I ask about my pending payments he is
telling worthless reasons.

Please guys don't believe Ramadoss.

Thanks Karthik for starting this thread. If you wish you can contact me
offline. I am interested to speak with you.

AFAIK, They just don't implement it. The person who obtained the order, 
in a way, implements it for their customers and customers of some of 
their competitors. I doubt, they would dare to question BSNL. Of course, 
this is just my opinion.

Hi all,

I thought this will create awareness to people, ILUGC also need to do this
type of awareness from people who bring bad impression to our mailing list.
Our mailing list must support genuine organization only. sometimes it may
be a personal attacking but what can we do? our vision is to save our
members from this type of forgery company.

I am also cheated by him (amachu) not only me it was a big list, that's why
I express this here.

Thanks.

I only felt you could have reached out to me too to listen & then made 
it up.

Hope you will do it after this at-least or in any thing you will come 
across of such kind in future: listening to the other end, before 
rushing up to a conclusion.

You can write to me & visit me at our office that in Nadanam. Wishing to 
meet you dude!

Do refer about this program to your known circle.

Say to the corporates you know to adopt such programs that will promote 
Open Source.

Consider, some one completing B.Sc., (Maths, Physics, Chemistry) - 
taking up a three year option to pursue M.C.A.,

After three years they will end up mostly without any work experience. 
Then they have to get into job to gain experience.

Anna Univ came with this program. And it is happening two days in a 
week. The rest of the days if they work inline with what they study, 
after two years imagine their status?

But, one thing that is troubling this program is that, if there aren't 
enough candidates (50 of them) registering the course is dropped.

I thought we should do something that we can that will be mutually 
beneficial.

Say four companies come forward with similar programs - they can have 10 
candidates each & University will have 40 students.

Not only that I have said to my team that we have to do this, I also 
approached few more companies to come out with similar programs & they 
too felt it is workable.

So if you are working think of it, propose it to your management & speak 
to some other corporates too.

Take the discussion in line with topic & than spitting personal venom 
listening just to one end. Hope you will come forward to meet me soon.

And it makes no sense why ISP will allow third party to touch their
infrastructure to block the sites.
And usually it isn't ISPs who get these court orders sanctioned.

I think, My statement was misleading. I meant something like seeing a 
blocked page with a message from Reliance Entertainment on an Airtel 
broadband connection.

In the case above, only Reliance Communications and Bharati Airtel 
implemented the court order. One can only speculate why it was not 
implemented by other ISPs.

Well in the recent case, there was an court order obtained by
copyrightlabs and it has been implemented by all ISPs including BSNL
and MTNL. In fact ISPs like Reliance and Airtel have removed the bans
but MTNL atleast still continues.
See http://www.medianama.com/2012/03/223-producers-of-tamil-film-3-get-court-order-making-isps-responsible-for-checking-piracy/
And these stupid ISPs pretty much blocked whole of legal sites like
pastebin, again it still continues on my MTNL connection.

I guess, these ISPs have just gone wild and blocked a lot of things even 
the ones not in the court order. Apparently, as per the hindu article, 
this is a mistake and was not intended.

http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/article3429836.ece

"Harish Ram, CEO, Copyright Labs, hired by producers of the movie 3, R K 
Productions Private Limited, for the online anti-piracy management of 
the movie, said that the ISPs had misinterpreted the order. ?Instead of 
blocking specific URLs that were screening the movie, they blocked the 
whole sites,? he said.."

I wonder if there is a clause in the court order to remove the block 
after a specific period of time. IMO, the ISPs might just forget to 
remove the block and its us who face problems in the end.

Yes you can.

   - Start Stellarium
   - Press F5 to show Date/time window (if you want to simulate it now) and
    change the date to 2012/06/06 and the time to an appropriate value. If you
   want to see the first point of contact, set the time to 3:41 AM. But you
   will have to remove the ground (by pressing G) as the sun will be below the
   horizon for us.
   - Press Ctrl+F and search for `Venus`. Stellarium will center the
   display on Venus.
   - Now, press Ctrl+Up arrow to zoom into the Sun and Venus system. You
   will be able to see the transit.

Arun

I personally feel that too much design and specs strangle a project, but
admittedly my experiences is in end user applications - not the kind of
thing Bell labs does. Further, Bell labs is Bell labs.

+1

I have managed a Cluster of three nodes using Shared storage
filesystem GFS, and LVS for load balancing.

LVS is a good place to start with to understand nuts and bolts, It
just needs more than one NIC on a dsktop.

I have not tried LVS on VMs though.

My web site has been subjected to this kind of blockage both from Tata
and MTNL.

At first I thought my site was down but it was accessible through
Anonymizers and to friends and colleagues in Europe, North America.
No response to trouble ticket @ Tata and with MTNL no expectation that
they will understand the problem.

Fortunately, in my case I had already planned to move the content to
another hosting company - it just happened 2 weeks sooner than
planned.

after some research, I find that this is the classic waterfall model of
software development, and better firms try different approaches like
extreme programming, scrum, agile etc. Has anyone had experience with
firms in india that follow these methods?

private software development goes this way - you develop something for 
someone.

When it comes to creations - you develop something & then reach out 
selling subscriptions, then the development practices involved under 
such scenarios, also need to get covered.

this goes for open source also. Most successful open source applications
were originally developed for a client who paid for it and then made
open source - examples are django and koha. Known as the 'sell it, free
it' model. In fact someone once said that if you cannot sell it, no one
will take it even if you give it free.

this very rarely works out. My motto is - if you do not have a client,
do not write software.

i am saying the practises adopted by Ubuntu, Fedora, Koha, Django, KDE, 
GNOME, OpenERP etc.,

How they put forth a timeline for every release, call for features to be 
added, bugs to be fixed, deadlines for translations, then alpha, beta 
then the final release.

Post release the approach they have for fixing bugs, how they release 
updates etc.,

This is something crucial to understand.

the only one I am familiar with is django - they fix a rough date for
release, but release when it is ready. They have rough list of features
for release, but those features get included only if someone gets them
ready. Same with translations. As for bugs, those described as release
blockers are fixed before release, if someone fixes others, they get
included in the release. In a purely voluntary community, that is all
that can be done. They do not have alpha, beta etc, they have release
candidate and release. I suspect that those projects where there are
companies backing them and paid developers, these things are more
systematic. Anyway if you have some experiences in these, please share.

VPN not needed. If you have shell access to an external machine
you can use SSH port forwarding and configure it as a SOCKS

There was this recent uproar about Reliance.

The following is a snippet from India anon ops press conf:

[14:38] The target ISP was Reliance.
[14:38] And we got the entire list of the blocked sites from them.
[14:38] And guess what it contained.
[14:39] It contained the list of all Government blocked sites.
[14:39] but it contained more too,
[14:40] It contained sites and URL that neither the public not the
Government has even heard of.
[14:40] Example is : links linking to search results and blogs on SATISH
SETH
[14:41] who was an executive in reliance, for some reason reliance had to
block him [ Of course for PROFIT REASONS]

I read somewhere they had even briefly blocked all blogs of the striking
pilots of Air India! I think this was because the govt leaned on them. I
wouldn't  be surprised if the other ISPs also obliged.

On your local desktop, run

ssh -D 8080 shell.example.org

and set your browser's proxy to SOCKS localhost 8080.

Hi guys,

?A professor from a college at Bangalore has posted a project which
would assist him to complete one of his research work. The
implementation is kind of POC which he would take it forward & modify
for his own purpose. This is a paid project.

?Details at http://stalkninja.com/project/529

?Expertise needed - intermediate expertise with Java, Open Source
project customization experience would surely help.

I use python mechanize to submit a form.

Using this page as a tutorial.
http://stockrt.github.com/p/emulating-a-browser-in-python-with-mechanize/

The form I uses shows a javascript confirmation box before submitting
in browser.

How to capture the javascript confirmation box in python using mechanize?

Or is there any other alternate?

Thanks.

would suffice if that could be brought out in a generic way. 
by-and-large its similar - terms vary.

today a popular Open Source Software would mean that it has to be 
packaged & made readily available as binary for installation atleast in 
two family of distros - debian & fedora.

post development - building them to get the binaries for various 
architectures & taking them to repos/ maintaining there or under one's 
own repo can be given some priority.

Subject: [Ilugc] Can DVD reader play DUAL layer DVD ?
Message-ID: <CAFHFDAmzFsMFT3dmgV5=We6=CGTfDRWuAERaf-6DjpL8g+8LRw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

This is a model of DVD which I have,  I can play a single layer DVD on it,
However when I try a Dual Layer DVD it is not working :-(

cat /proc/scsi/scsi
Attached devices:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: HL-DT-ST Model: DVD+-RW GSA-T40N Rev: A100
  Type:   CD-ROM                           ANSI  SCSI revision: 05


I have also tried following this link
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/PlayingDVDs

sudo apt-get install libdvdread4

and

/usr/share/doc/libdvdread4/install-css.sh

Rebooted my PC still no effect.

I tried to upgrade fedora 16 x86-64 via preupgrade a few days ago.
After the first stage up to download of packages and installation of
grub2 for the actual install process ... it went fine.
The new grub2 entry was not bootable (known bug?), but anyway I
modified it manually and started anaconda.
The installer invariably crashed after ?wanting a network connection?
(actually the machine connects manually to the Internet).
All of the tricks including
deletion of /etc/anaconda.repo and modification of the ks file did not work.


Fresh Install from dvd was ok... except for no support for encrypted btrfs.

Grub2 of Kubuntu-12.04 cannot handle Fedora-17 entries at all.


Best

Hi Srini,
I dont think they did anything wrong apart from mentioning the name of 
the person. Actually they did a good job and  saved my time a bit.I am 
sure not only me there would be at least 10+ people who would have  
benefited by their feedback. I was about to go and  make an inquiry 
about the course. As we all know there are N number of training 
institutes across chennai. but hardly a handful them are genuine and 
giving proper training which is worth of the fees paid by the student.

What if some on mentions in  future that they lost their money by 
joining  the same place. We all can only sympathize  and share the 
grievance. This is the same reason few days before I posted a feedback 
about my ex-employer.Some one will inform the management so that they 
will change their attitude
I believe we  should isolate such  people in the society so that they 
will change them selves.
" There is always an opportunity to make a full stop so that once can 
start restart"
IF I deviate any of the guidelines of the forum please excuse me"

yum update is the route for RHEL.

In fact any distro which uses Package management system

Please confirm the implication of support issues with Redhat before
you follow any other method for installation. It may void it.

If you can/want desparately, you can probably try out Centos

BTW RHEL/Centos 6 has a newer browser.

Known issue.  https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common_F17_bugs#preupgrade-grub

I am not aware of this.  Perhaps file a bug report.

> Fresh Install from dvd was ok... except for no support for encrypted btrfs.

Known issue since Btrfs support itself has regressed as a fallout of the
ongoing Anaconda changes.  However I would recommend against using Btrfs
in any production instance in any case since it doesn't have a fsck that
can fix errors yet.

> Grub2 of Kubuntu-12.04 cannot handle Fedora-17 entries at all.

No idea why

Hai all,

I am using Facebook and most of Google products in Tamil and I am
proudly enjoying it. I found that in Twitter, there was no option for
Tamil (but Hindi is there.)

I went to http://translate.twttr.com/ to request for Tamil language.
The response was this:

"We truly appreciate hearing from our users. If *we receive enough
requests*, chances are we'll support your language in the future."

I highly doubt that future if I leave it like that. So I need your
help. (Even if you are not interested in translating) Please visit
this link http://translate.twttr.com/lang_request and fill up the mini
form to add Tamil. That is all. (You may be asked to sign in using
Twitter oauth.)

Thank you,
Vigneshwaran

It is okay for people to have difference of opinion, or to disagree
with each other, but, person name calling shouldn't happen on a forum
or a mailing list. There is something called "maintaining the sanctity
of the forum" or the group.

Keep personal discussions and arguments private. One shouldn't use a
public system for personal gains.

If they knew, and they were interested in taking your case, they could
file a defamation case against you.

an informed comment in public interest is not defamation ;-) btw, if a
person starts a business or training course and takes money from people
or promises them salary with no intention of fulfilling his promise,
that amounts to cheating. But if he does so with the full intention of
keeping his promises, but is unable to do it because his
business/training model fails - that is not cheating.

if he has signed such stuff, there may be breach of agreement - but not

You will have to set the DISPLAY environment variable to the right
display number. Something like 'export DISPLAY=:0' before running the
script.

not necessarily. In the first place, as far as I know, developers rarely
package their own apps. The packages are usually built by 3rd parties.
Also a lot of apps do not have binaries - like django. Also since
deployment in a framework like django is usually through virtualenv or
buildout, the rpm/deb cannot be used. I have seen people trying to use
the packaged version of django in Fedora and Ubuntu and it has been very
frustrating for them.

Hi

Could some one point me at some good Video Tutorial on learning about SPF

it cannot.  I am getting confused with soft fail.

     Let me give a brief explanation of how it works.You publish SPF
records for your domain. So, in your DNS, you add entries like

mydomain	IN	TXT	"v=spf1 +mx -all"

When a remote server receives a mail, it does a TXT look up, sees that
only those machines with an MX entry can send record, and so sees if
the sending machine has an MX entry and accepts it. Otherwise, it can
reject it.

But now, what the server does on a failure(it can be a soft fail or
fail), depends on the administrator of the receiver's SMTP server.
The docs at openspf.org are really nice.


So, returning to your question of when to add a domain and when not to
- you don't add any domains. You define an SPF record for your
organisation(domain). And configure your mail server's actions based
on your needs. Thanks

I will tell you what I know.

SPF records are TXT records that give the list of netblocks that a
mail server will use to
 send mail from.

But you can choose to ignore it.

Correct me if I am wrong but what has MX records got to do with SPF records?

MX is for receiving mail, SPF is for sending...

Or am I wrong?

     I was just explaining my example :). When you define an SPF
record with a +mx record, all A records of all MX records are actually
checked. The link below explains it.

http://www.openspf.org/SPF_Record_Syntax#mx

> MX is for receiving mail, SPF is for sending...
>
> Or am I wrong?

       May be I didn't put it in a clear way.

SPF is for the receiver of your mail to see if the mail actually came
from your network.
MX is need when some one sends an email to you. His SMTP server looks
up for MX records in your DNS and sends it to that server.(Of course,
it is more complex that a single like :) ). thanks

      I guess it should be IPAddress:0 where IP address is the IP of
the machien running your X server. I can be localhost:0 as well if
your localhost has an Xserver. Thanks

The reason why I am asking for this is because we are often getting spoofed
emails and to avoid that we need to add SPF checking for a particular
domain before confirming the authenticity of that email.

If it is hardfail in SPF people tell me it is good to do SPF check, however
when it is softfail why does not the authenticity of the received email get
maintained ?

     Another good technology that we can use is DKIM. But, 
unfortunately, it is not yet in wide use.

I am not sure if I got your question correct. If you are asking why the 
mails are not getting dropped for a Softfail, it is bescause the RFC 
says the the receiving end SHOULD NOT reject the mails based on this. 
So, the normal solution for this would be to let the user mark it as 
spam. One possible reason that we need the soft fail mechanish is that 
the DNS SPF entry has been changed and the system still has some mails 
in an undelivered state.

To explain it better, let's say a domain had no SPF entries defined. And 
some 100 emails have been sent from various servers of that domain. Now, 
if the admin sets the SPF record to

mx -all

All mails from boxes other than the MX would get dropped by the 
receiving mail server, and some of them might be legitimate. It might be 
that all the new policy might not have been known to some people in the 
organisation and hence they are using machines other than the MX. So, to 
allow such emails to be delivered, the SPF is defined as follows,

mx ~ all

Now, the receiving entity will receive a soft fail, but SHOULD NOT 
reject the email. This is the reason why we normally don't reject for 
soft fails. Thanks

:D No problem. Nice examples as it contains an "include" record as well.

  Unfortunately you cannot do it based on just this. The best solution 
is to write to Paypal asking them to create a proper hard fail 
record(-all) instead of(~all).

I am not very sure, but there must be means to add a custom header, 
something like X-SPF-Check, and ask the people in your domain to have a 
filter based on that header field. If the header is set, the mails 
should be handled with caution as it can be a spoof mail. But in my 
opinion, it is in everyone's interest that Paypal defines a proper fail 
record. Thanks


PS: On a GNU/Linux machine, if you install dnsutils package, you get the 
'dig' tool. It is very easy to use, instead of using an external 
website. dig -t txt icicib at nk.d0m would return all its text entries, and 
hence its SPF records.

Use dbus, it is designed exactly for this usage.

X has an authentication mechanism between the X server and the client. The
shared secret MIT MAGIC COOKIE is stored in the xauthority file which is
accessible only by the local user who has started the X session. If you
want to applications launched by your cron job to communicate to X sessions
of other users, you will have to bypass the X session security mechanisms.
Not a recommended practice.

+1 (Nice and succinct explanation Raja).

Sidebar question to OP - can it not be done via a simple email?   I
guess your objective is to notify the users that the job is completed.

Last Friday, June 1, 2012, I handled a linux intro session at IndusNet
Technologies, Nungambakkam, Chennai.

I explored the following topics to the developers there.

Open Source - Intro
Ubuntu Installation
Dual Boot / Partitioning concepts
Installing Applications
Installing web applications
How to use MySQL
Backup of files
Some commandline tips

Thanks for Mr.Kumar for arranging this session.

They already moved from Dreamweaver to Aptana/Eclipse for their web development.

Hope they can move to ubuntu desktops easily.

Good that you want to learn perl.

Learn UNIX, shell scripting and play with Linux.

Then perl becomes easy.

There are plenty of sites but you don't need them.

Just install perldoc and look at all the perldoc pages. Plenty of them.

perldoc perl

perldoc perlfaq{1,2,3,4,5,6}

perldoc perloo

perldoc perlintro

perldoc perltoot

perldoc perlbot

and so on

To the best of my knowledge, all desktop and laptop DVD-RW units can
play and burn Dual Layer media.   I have had no problems playing the
official Star Wars DVDs on my Linux laptop.

I have also had DVD units "loose" their functionality over a period of
time e.g. it will read DVD but not able to boot from DVD etc.  Your
unit may be in this category.

My experience with the external USB DVD units has been similar.  In
general life expectancy has been about 12-18 months with the units
(desktop, laptop, and USB external) I have had.

when requirements are gathered, seldom one has info as to who will 
develop it. developers are rarely exposed to the requirements at the 
initial stages.

neither are they too interested to test their code & they leave it 
testers. most of them even believe that testing is something beyond 
their fundamental responsibility. after something is reported they do 
come forward to fix it. :-)

It is not php. Perl takes 3 years to learn.

php could be picked up in 3 months.

Perl is not meant for kids and impatient people.

So hold on tight and learn.

As I said learn UNIX, shell scripting and so on.

IPC, socket communication, databases, OO and so on.

Learning perl is little different from learning php. 

Lot of materials are here
http://www.perl.org/learn.html

For modern way of perl usage
http://modernperlbooks.com/books/modern_perl/index.html

If you want modern web programming look at frameworks like dancer, catalyst,mojolicious etc

I have a small introduction in my blog at

My advise is to never use tor. It is used for lot of illegal activity and
heavily monitored by law enforcement. You become guilty by association.

Running tor in any enterprise network will set off several security
triggers. You will have a lot of explaining to do.

It's not worth the risk.

I was led to believe that laziness, impatience and hubris were the three
virtues of a good Perl programmer.

The Camel Book defines each as

1. Laziness - the habit which motivates you to write code and automate
things. This is what makes you code.

2. Impatience - the feeling you have when your computer is being lazy. This
is what motivates you to write high performance code.

3. Hubris - the pride that your code quality is so hood that others cannot
find flaws in it.

To the OP, IMO the best resource to learn Perl is by reading the
Programming Perl book published by Oreilly. It's a great introduction to
Perl culture. Written by the creators of Perl and till date I have found
nothing to better it.

Hi,

When you did you bought your laptop because if it is more than three year
old. Then there may be a chance of having
single layer DVD writer/reader only.

Python has a lot of frameworks as you mentioned like django, pyramid,
flask etc.. I would say that django is as powerful as rails is (There
is literally a django snippet out there for whatever you may need) and
literally speaking, I would not be lazy enough to write some code (as
a developer), if there isn't one available.

Subject: [Ilugc] the browser VM
Message-ID: <CALDskyyLCg_1zZ7Fy6FGEcw_DypM+dZKSs=OyhPmkV=7uSYw=g@mail.gmail.com>

Javascript is a great programming language like perl.

It is a unique language as it runs with the browser as OS or VM.

In this article we will look at the features of javascript and the
general picture.

In the case of javascript the context matters more than anything else.

Javascript cannot run in an OS. It's OS is the browser.

And there is no better debugging tool than firebug with the firefox
browser like gdb on UNIX.

Javascript is an interpreted language like perl or python and you can
install a command
 line interpreter called spidermonkey on linux.

Spidermonkey will give you a js prompt.

js
js>

So you can test out all your data structure doubts and function doubts
using this.

But only the browser environment with firebug can give you real
development testing.

spidermonkey has limitations.

If you are not understanding what I am saying then don't worry. You
need to have some experience
 in web development to follow what I am talking.

Now let us look at some general concepts which everyone can follow.

A web programming language , particularly web 2.0 like Ajax or jQuery
or JSON/XML requires a
 thorough knowledge of the context; ie, web components.

Those are the browser, web server, DOM(Document Object Model) which is
the XML/HTML view of
 the web page and of course javascript and CSS.

This is not an easy topic and cannot be covered in one article but we
will see whatever can be
covered.

Basically a GUI development toolkit will only be concerned about the
particular OS the programming
 model for GUI development and the toolkit itself.

In the case of javascript based GUI development javascript is not
actually a GUI toolkit.

jQuery is a javascript toolkit/library. But the toolkit for GUI is
composed of CSS for styling/beauty, HTML
 DOM for the structure and skeleton and the dynamic behavior is
dictated by javascript and Ajax.

Ajax is nothing but plainjane CGI with some pepper; it can be called
without reloading the page.

Nothing but new age CGI.

And JSON helps  you obtain nested data structures(array of arrays)
from a different server other than
 your web server.

In fact today nearly all web development is done using JSON. But I
don't use it in my products' web panels.

In all this GUI work you will need to do a lot of backend CGI work
which I do using perl and all browser
 end programming using jQuery and javascript.

But to do this you need to understand HTML, CSS and DOM.

There is a lot of learning to do before one can program effectively on the web.

Generally true in practice as most folks use this for browser client side
programming. Javascript runs on web servers too and can be used for back
end web application programming. Node.js has been making news in the recent
past as a good asynchronous server.

The best introduction to Perl, both the basics and OOP, I've read is: Object
Oriented Perl: A Comprehensive Guide to Concepts and Programming Techniques by
Damien Conway [1], Manning Publications.

Once you've read through at least the first 4-5 chapters, go through perlintro,
perldsc [2], perltoot, perlstyle, perltrap, perlcheat. If you're serious about
Perl, get the O'Reilly Perl Cookbook, and Perl Best Practices (also by Damien).

Finally, Perl has a very good ecosystem for debugging, testing, and re-using
code (CPAN). Please read through perldebtut and perlfaq.

           perlfaq1: General Questions About Perl
           perlfaq2: Obtaining and Learning about Perl
           perlfaq3: Programming Tools
           perlfaq4: Data Manipulation
           perlfaq5: Files and Formats
           perlfaq6: Regular Expressions
           perlfaq7: General Perl Language Issues
           perlfaq8: System Interaction
           perlfaq9: Networking

perltoc is a big help as well. All of the above from running perldoc <name>
(e.g., perldoc perltoc).

[1] He is able to convey complicated concepts in an amazingly simple and
intuitive way. Sacrilegiously, streets ahead of Tom Christiansen and Randal
Schwartz. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Conway

[2] If you're not a die-hard OOP fan, you'll be surprised at how much can be
done using the basic data structures. Esp. with anonymous functions.

HTH,
Sameer

Though I'm a great fan of firefox and firebug and they are my personal
preferences as well, I would say chrome's dev tools is equally good.

Those except XML are not languages. Ajax is just a technique to load
content asynchronously using js. jQuery is a javascript library. JSON is a
data format originated from javascript.

DOM is not HTML view. As the name suggests, it's how the document (the web
page) is represented as set of objects in your browser. In fact, that was
the very first reason why firebug was developed - though one could simply '
view source code' of a page, which is the HTML view, there was no good way
to visualize DOM.

> And JSON helps  you obtain nested data structures(array of arrays)

s/array/object
In javascript, an array is an object but the converse is not true.

Btw, JSON has replaced XML in the web in the recent years, thanks to its
much simpler yet much more powerful representation.

Even XML is not a *programming* language.

If you have not used dual layer DVD before or other OS also does not
read dual layer DVD then your DVD player may not be capable of reading
dual layer DVDs. I bought a system (assembled PC) in 2007 and it
supports Dual layer DVDs (Samsung Octo Edge DVD - The DVD player
manufacturer is TSST Corp). You DVD player may be a problem. To make
sure this try with a different Dual layer DVD, different OS.

        For FTP, I guess it is something like
acl FTP proto FTP
always_redirect allow FTP

The squid.conf file has excellent comments for each section. Please do
go through that. It should be easy enough to configure squid for FTP,
HTTPS etc. Thanks

Dear Friends,

The freedom of an internet user is facing serious threats from many
quarters ? the Ministry of IT, various state governments and the police and
now certain major Internet Service Providers (ISP's) such as Reliance
Communications, Airtel and MTNL. Major sites such as Vimeo and various
Torrent sites commonly used for exchange of large files are being blocked
by these ISP's, even though no instructions have been issued by the
Government.

We have already seen the effect of the IT Rules in which a huge number of
requests are now being directed to intermediaries such as Google, Facebook,
etc. for taking down statements critical of the Government and political
figures. Cases are being instituted by the Police under the IT Act against
circulating of cartoons, calling it a cyber-crime. All this shows that our
democratic freedoms guaranteed under the constitution are currently under
attack. Equally worrying is the tendency of courts to issue blanket orders
-- called John Doe orders -- to protect the Intellectual Property of
certain media companies. Reliance Communications, an ISP is acting in the
interest of Reliance as a Media company to block a large number of Torrent
sites.

Against such actions of the Government and the ISP's,  the Free Software
Movement of India (FSMI) has called for peaceful protests across the
country[1], and appeals to all democratic minded citizens to participate on
the 9th of June 2012. In connection with this the Free Software Foundation,
Tamil Nadu (FSFTN) in solidarity with other communities organising a
peaceful protest meeting in Chennai.

Time: 4.00 PM - 6.00 PM

Venue: Besant Nagar Beach

In the light of protest calls made by other communities, we feel it is
important to discuss about internet freedom and censorship. This is an
opportunity for you to know about the rights of an internet user and to
contribute your share in upholding the same. Please be present for the same
and voice your concerns!

You  can know more about Free Software and Internet Freedom from the
websites of FSFTN: http://fsftn.org/ and FSMI:  http://fsmi.in/.

This is like the classic case of a truck stuck in wet mud :)

The Fedora DVD image fits into a single layer DVD media.   If your
unit is having problems with single layer then it is RIP most likely.

Do the following:

1. Boot from a bootable CD ROM?   yes/no
2. Boot from a single layer bootable DVD (any distro will do)?  yes/no

3. Insert a CD ROM for reading (booted into any OS from HDD/USB)?   yes/no
4. Insert a DVD ROM for reading (booted into any OS from HDD/USB)?   yes/no

Draw your conclusions from the result.

It is possible but unlikely.   I could play dual layer DVD movies in a
laptop bought in 2006.

>From the OP I am surmising that the unit could read dual layer media
in the past but not any more now.

I don't agree.. what do you mean by a lot of illegal activity? The
thread so far has been about "illegally" accessing sites that are
blocked in India.. :) I don't see your point here.. And how exactly
does law enforcement agents monitor tor??

You can possibly just replace the drive with a newer version/get an
external drive. In any case if you dont have any critical data on dvd, just
stop using optical media and move to usb drives. Have had multiple bad
experiences with both HP and Lenovo dvd drives on laptops - they just died
after a couple of years.

Lawful Intercept requests to record Tor Traffic. Tor's signature is well
known afaik. ISP's don't like having TOR on their networks as they are
"used by terrorists". Some actively block it. Whether the leo's can decode
the captured traffic is another story 8-)
You're better off with ssh to access the internets. Does not raise as many
flags.

Among other things, tor has been used for child pornography. Which is why
any tor traffic is taken very seriously and closely monitored.

It makes no sense to use tor to access something perfectly legitimate sites
like pastebin.

> And how exactly does law enforcement agents monitor tor??

Every ISP in India (and most of the world) is mandated to provide
wiretapping service for law enforcement agencies.

See the CALEA.

Nice and thanks for sharing the link.    I started my Linux experience

System Administrators are there to setup, manage and fix systems because we
haven't yet invented machines intelligent enough to perform these tasks on
their own very reliably.

I haven't seen system admins being packaged into deb, rpm, exe or even

If you have doubts about anything then IMO it should not be pursued.

>From the other things you mention in your OP, it appears to me that
you want to pursue something that gives you maximum monetary return.
A couple of years ago, I had an intern who wanted to be a Network
Admin.  Why?  because the salary for this job function is good but she
did not have the aptitude.

Each of us have our own strengths, only you can find  what interests
you and do you have the aptitude for that interest. Once you have
figured it out then pursue your interest with full gusto; the monetary
compensation will follow.   Sometimes this self discovery can take
time and patience on your part.

They have been there forever and they will be there , these are one of the
most satisfying and remunerative jobs one can have. You need not try to
look out too hard for jobs they are plenty in the market at every level.

3.How would be the packages for linux admin when compared to the

depends on lots of factors , your skills , size of operations you have
manged and of course you need to have programming skills too and
the languages you mentioned do come in handy . Just an example of scale
think about Google, Yahoo and Facebook what kind of engineers must be
handling there operations.

Well initially  you are like Sponge , if you are not you better be one ....

Seen Sysadmins who had  washed dishes to written  books   and yes they are
wonderful human beings to work with , Have faith in whatever you do you
should just be fine , do not forget to Enjoy whatever you are doing !!

In my experience, linux system administrators *are* expected to know 
scripting language especially perl and shell-scripting. So by learning 
perl/python/php/ruby, you are not changing your career but improving the 
existing one. So, go ahead and learn it today.

Being a linux system administrator has its advantages and disadvantages, 
like in any other career. I am guessing, you haven't got challenging 
work yet. I have a few friends who manage a few hundred machines across 
4-5 continents and go to sleep with their pager. You are really on the 
line of fire, if something goes wrong and company is losing revenue, you 
will be the first man on the scene. Then comes the 
management/developer/tester etc.

Trust me, starting out, few years is frustrating in any career. Hang in 
there and do your best, things will fall in place. In the meantime, keep 
learning something new, even if it can help you only a little.

PS: I am not a system administrator.

Wonderful! Nice to see good-quality online tutorials for Perl, esp. Simon
Cozen's book(s). TIMTOWTDI is both a blessing and a curse while learning Perl. I
found the perlfaq idioms useful and immediately applicable, but it took a long
time to understand the subtleties.

Thanks for sharing,

        My understanding of his statement is "Don't work for someone,
start your own company". If my understanding is correct, I don't think
that is moronic. Just that many people(myself included) do not want to
take that risk.

And, may be you just want to counter everything that Girish writes.
And, may be his statement is too cryptic for some people to

Unfortunately, That is not what I understood. I felt offended because it

This is a *gross* misunderstanding. I apologize to Girish, if he felt 
offended. We might have difference in opinions at times but I respect 
his work and contribution to the list. I have nothing against him, 
please avoid such negative statements.

Subject: [Ilugc] IP address and netmask
Message-ID: <CALDskyybfQiFtH4ApA8nP0+QAfP0UC9FdGcPqfnmk7OFydZa=Q@mail.gmail.com>

An IP address is composed of 32 bits which is 4 bytes usually written in the
 form a.b.c.d.

Using a tiny sample space of 2^32 possibilities we have been able to
successfully networking
 all electronic items.

I wonder what is going to be the timeline for IPv6 rollout.

An IP address is composed of 4 octets or 4 bytes written in a human
readable form with dots
 in between.

But computers see it differently. It sees it as a hexadecimal
quantity, an unsigned long integer.

It is also represented differently and written differently if the
machine is little endian or big endian.

The network byte order or the alignment for networking by convention
is always big endian.

That way people talk a common language on the wire.

Anyway an IP address looks like this internally(0xC0A80103 or
3232235779) which is what we
 write as 192.168.1.3.

$ sipcalc 192.168.1.3/24
-[ipv4 : 192.168.1.3/24] - 0

[CIDR]
Host address            - 192.168.1.3
Host address (decimal)  - 3232235779
Host address (hex)      - C0A80103
Network address         - 192.168.1.0
Network mask            - 255.255.255.0
Network mask (bits)     - 24
Network mask (hex)      - FFFFFF00
Broadcast address       - 192.168.1.255
Cisco wildcard          - 0.0.0.255
Addresses in network    - 256
Network range           - 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255
Usable range            - 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254

Using IP addresses we can do a lot of things.

In fact everything in networking and Internet is actually IP addresses.

We should learn 3 special network blocks , 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12
and 192.168.0.0/16 which
 are not globally unique.

You use them for computers in a local LAN and they never go out to the
Internet that way.

Only possibility is either NAT them with a globally unique IP address
which rewrites the packet header
 or you should use a VPN to talk to another LAN that is remote.

In which case the IP address should be unique across all the LANs
connected by VPN.

Certain IP addresses are used for broadcast purposes. I have never had
to worry about them
 so far.

The concept of netmask is closely linked with the idea of network and
host ranges.

An IP address always starts with a network part and then a host part.

This is very simple. All names in a family end with a certain surname.
Similarly all IP addresses in
 a network start with a certain pattern, say 10. or 192.168. or
172.16... or some such thing.

The host part can change to identify each machine like we identify
each family member by a name.

The netmask is nothing but a simple electronics concept of applying
bitmask over the IP address
 written in binary which does not change for all computers in a network.

You specify a network in many ways.

Like this usually called CIDR, 192.168.1.0/24 which means that 24 bits
of the IP addresses do not change.

Or you say, 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

which means that the mask is of length 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 bits

You can also say 255.240.0.0 which is same as 8+4 = 12 bits

It is not very hard.

Only networks have masks. IP addresses don't have them.

Which means that you cannot have two different IP addresses just by
changing the mask.

That won't work. Mask is a feature of the IP address space.

In case some of you guys have missed, We just had World IPv6 day.

http://bit.ly/MunPMl

Major players like google have started using AAAA records in their DNS.

$ dig mx +short gmail.com
20 alt2.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
30 alt3.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
40 alt4.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
5 gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.
5 gmail-smtp-in-v4v6.l.google.com.
10 alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.

$ dig aaaa +short gmail-smtp-in-v4v6.l.google.com
2a00:1450:8005::1a

I noticed that google SMTP servers were blocking a large range of IPv6 
address as bulk mailers. I guess, this is because, you can get a large 
number of ipv6 address for free or at a very low cost. Anyway, I had to 
use IPv4 with google SMTP servers to solve the problem. I guess, it is 
going to take a while before such small problems are solved.

I guess you mean Ubuntu 10.10. Most of the wireless modems from ZTE,
Huawei are supported by Linux (you may need to do some configuration
changes in some older distro - google can help you here). Can you
provide specific problem. Network manager should detect the device
(most of the reliance, tata USB data cards are supported inherently in
recent distro).

When I did not have direct internet connection in my PC I created one
shell script to assist in updating or installing software in Ubuntu
(understanding apt is the key). The application can be found at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ubuoffupdater/?source=directory. Try
that and let me know - I will be glad to provide help.

Yes Its possible to change your career if you want. Most of the admins
would like to learn or would have learnt some scripting language  as part
of their skillset and this might to ease their life and save time. There
can be many repetitive work which can be automated. using Unix power tools,

This is completely dependant on your skill, company's requirement, and

that does not mean that you will be paid more as a programmer..

I do not think your understanding is correct. There are certain clueless
people who look down on people like sysadmins and testers. One can start
one's own company to do sysadmin work (and do testing too). I know
several companies like this, and they are all doing very well. I know a
guy who sits in his village near pattiveeranpatti and admins servers in
Florida - makes good money and enjoys his work.

Hi

I need to know what is the best Novice GUI development tool on Ubuntu.

For example if I am writing a small python script where in it just adds up
two number, I need to create a small stand alone application which will
show two text box for entering numbers and Add button.  The answer should
get displayed in the total box.

In any search engine put the following keywords "centos clustering"
and you will get a lot of documentation on how to go about with
clustering (you could have done it yourself a priori)

but ....

as other members have asked you - you need to figure out what is this
cluster for?

Retain a competent consultant who can guide you in the effort in case
your company is unable to define the functional requirements for the
cluster.

Subject: [Ilugc] how a technical company should be run
Message-ID: <CALDskyxOkBBMRU20kqePuE7hD8Jiw9B73ShKhMm0Fv7W1N_=zQ@mail.gmail.com>

We will discuss both technical and non technical topics. You have to
view technology in the perspective in which
 I am seeing.

At least it is useful for you to appreciate my view.

Reason being that I repeatedly find that though I fail to impress many
fellow Indians the selfsame qualities
 make me quite successful and likeable in the worldwide market.

So in a lot of ways if you are able to appreciate my point of view if
not accept it or imbibe it it will help you.

I think ultimately success is about hard work, doing the right things
and not being narrow minded.

People who do well in India alone with bad attitude and mindset that
is not suitable for the worldwide job
market or business market cannot survive for long.

This applies to companies also. Most technology companies in India,
particularly Chennai that I have seen
 very closely do not operate by principles of technical excellence,
global competitiveness, technical focus,
 quality consciousness, customer support and fair practices.

They are run by business principles running it as a business
enterprise focusing on sales.

Au contraire, a company should be run by strong focus on technology,
knowledge and problem solving.

This will come automatically when your customer base is abroad, but it
will also come if you have customers
 here but your focus is correct.

A technical company exists just like any other business due to money
and making money.

A technical company has to make money; sales and marketing matters a lot.

But that should not happen by you going making flashy presentations,
massive advertisements, promoting
 with lot of businessmen and marketing execs.

It should happen in a subtle way.

You should spend the bulk of your effort in improving technology,
products,support and so on. This will automatically
 happen in any technology company. I have seen this in many places.

And the business development happens by virtue of online promotions,
good website, good downloadable products,
 online manuals, documentation, SEO and so on.

The sales/marketing effort done in the local market should be a team
of technically knowledgeable people with strong
 business and people skills , who meet people and give product demonstrations.

Instead if you focus on brand building and only talking big words, we
can do this,our product is this and so on it will
 not help.

A technology company proves in action. People pay money for products
that work stably and are easy to use.

Hi all,
I wish to burn a CD/ DVD using a Linux application. The characteristic that
I expect much is that the CD/DVD must be readable in all platforms but,
must be protected from getting copied (i.e One cannot copy either the
entire or a part of the contents written in the disk)
Is there any way out?

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and I am ready to install any software for this
activity

         Leaving the technical aspects aside, this is bad
"philosophically". After all, you are asking, "Is there a way I can
restrict/withhold the 4 point-freedom(as listed out by FSF) using a
free software. Irony :) But can you please tell why you need such a
thing ?

       I am not aware of a tool that is fool-proof. If a software can
read a CD(you need to do that for using the CD), then someone can
definitely write software that can read the CD and write it to a
file(or a CD image). Thanks

Subject: [Ilugc] Different UNIX variants
Message-ID: <CALDskyx13RCwGQodBUuTnjxuEaM5jfwuMZJmtnGP3kAj5OH-ug@mail.gmail.com>

People think that OpenBSD is another Linux.

Such basic things are not known to many since most of the crowd here
are beginners and opposed to
 their knowledge of the latest Vijay dance or cricket record nobody
seems to care to know
 the trivia about technology.

It is not a hep topic to discuss amongst friends. So this is usually not learnt.

Anyway I will try to clarify it based on what I know. I could be wrong
in certain things but
 it will still help some.

Basically the very first UNIX OS was written by the authors of C. They
wrote C to write UNIX.

This had two variants, Chocolate chips and Yankee doodle.

One was AT and T and other was BSD.

It was then bought by Novell, then made free and so on.

Some politics was involved in this.

All of you know that Linux was born in 1993 I think and that Linus
Torvalds a student in Finland
 wrote it.

UNIX had its beginnings in early 70s I think.

Then Jordan K Hubbard put in lot of efforts in creating FreeBSD. That
was the first BSD I think.

Along the same lines NetBSD was born and Theo, the creator of OpenBSD
was suddenly fired
 from the NetBSD core team because he was not a people guy. He was
more interested in
 code quality and other political minded souls in the team disliked
him or even was jealous of him.

Then Theo floated OpenBSD sometime before Linux I think and he has
managed to bring about
 a culture of technical correctness and top class technical quality
attracting the best minds.

Around the time Novell had UNIX, Digital corporation released what is
known as DEC UNIX.

Then Sun released Solaris. I have worked a lot in Solaris.

Then you also have other commercial UNIX products - IBM AIX and HP UX.

In today's world we have:

Commercial UNIX:

        HP UX
        IBM AIX
        Sun Solaris

Free UNIX
       FreeBSD
       NetBSD
       OpenBSD
       DragonflyBSD

I dunno about the status of DragonFlyBSD. I have never used it.

But I do know a lot of people use FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.

The fact that OpenBSD is being recognized as  a solid OS is helping me
earn money since
 I get business from my open source LiveUSB and LiveCD projects.

So slowly the quality is becoming popular amongst masses.

As to Linux, people think that it is superior to UNIX. It is not true.

It is superior to commercial UNIX,yes.

But free UNIX OSes have caught up with the latest innovation and they
are quite advanced.

There is no concept of distros or distributions in the UNIX world.

Linux is a kernel, you have GNU userland and you create an OS in different ways.

This is why you have various distributions like Slackware,
debian,Ubuntu, Suse, Fedora, Redhat.

But in the case of FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD the entire OS is
maintained by the team.

Which is the userland, kernel, the packages or ports.

So every POSIX OS can be broken down into:

1) kernel
2) Base system(userland which is shells and few utilities) that are
installed as
 part of the base install. This includes the libc library, /etc/ files and so on
3) Packages which are optional add ons to work according to the taste of the
 person using or the application for which UNIX Is installed

The packaging system is named differently and used differently by each
distribution in the Linux
world and each OS in the rest of UNIX landscape.

Essentially each package is a tar zip file with some specification
with it and dependency statements.

rpm, deb and so on are examples.

In the *BSD world you usually only have tar.gz files.

In the Windows world if you wish to use UNIX commands then there are a
few choices today.

MingW and Cygwin are the most prominent.

These are not OSes.They emulate the POSIX system calls and run fork()
over Windows threads.

Today you also have various methods by which you can get familiarity
with various free UNIX OSes.

You can run it inside VirtualBox, VMWare player or qemu.

You also have several LiveCDs which do not even touch your hard disk.

This is the general overview of the UNIX world.

For you to become fairly familiar with all this you need to love this
and learn this with interest,
 not for getting a job or getting higher salary but to really enjoy this.

There are plenty of enjoyments in the UNIX world.

They don't crash like certain Windows OSes. They are completely free
of cost and
 they give you lot of power and control.

And of course with some initial pain you will start understanding the
benefits of running UNIX.

 Dear All FOSSouls,
                Greetings from IIT Bombay! It always feels great to connect
to FOSS enthusiasts like you. We're working on a Project, viz, Spoken
Tutorial, wherein we encourage people to learn and use FOSS. Our vision is
to make every Indian switch to Open Source Software. Our project is a part
of the National Mission on Education through ICT, funded by MHRD, Govt. Of
India. We're working towards our vision in the following way-

* Training college students and faculty on software that they can use in
their future professional life, for example, Scilab, Python, PHP & MySQL,
LaTeX and Linux. This training is also offered to corporate.

* Training Libre Office and Linux Ubuntu to staff members of schools,
colleges, Govt. offices and corporate

* Offering FDP on LaTeX to all faculty members, aiming at betterment of
academics in India
         We have also worked on making Scilab a part of KIET Ghaziabad's
regular curriculum in Elect. Engg and CSE if you want I can send you the
syllabus topics also.We have also done many workshops in south including
IITM
  To avail this training programmes all a learner need is a computer and a
basic mobile ear-phone. Learners need not leave their campus to avail the
training. We basically reach out to learners through networking. This
network is being spread out across the country by students and faculty who
have experienced the magic of learning FOSS using our magical AV
Instructional Methodology, viz, 'Spoken Tutorials'. These AV tools are sent
by us in a CD (can also be downloaded from http://spoken-tutorial.org). We
also network by participating in various conferences/ symposiums/ any
national level meet. Journals/ Publications are also good means of reaching
out to public, for us.We have already done more than 2000 workshops of the
above mentioned FOSS in all over India.

   As both of us share a common dream, i.e, to Fossize India, let's work
together. We'll be happy to receive contacts from you either to offer
Software Training Workshops or to participate in conferences or to publish
articles.

Awaiting your reply..

Jai Hind!

This is not technically mandatory anymore. CIDR replaced the class-based
network addressing scheme a long time ago.

 I guess, the problem is with the classification of UNIX as free and
commercial. For eg, there are features in Solaris(or rather, Open
Solaris, now called  Open Indiana) that aren't yet production ready on
GNU/Linux world. One such example is DTrace. ZFS is now available, I
guess. Their concept of zones is excellent.

     In the Open Solaris/Open Indiana world, we have the concept of
"distros". BeleniX, SchilliX, Nexenta, and Open Indiana itself are
various distros. They all use the illumos kernel, and then use various
solaris user land applications. Various packages are available as
well. In fact, in their recent build(151a), installing a package is
extremely user friendly. They have a synaptic like UI where you can
search and click and install stuff.

        Another such windows port is UWIN from the AT&T software labs. Thanks

AFAIK, CIDR only dispenses with the need to have rigid network address
space and make it network admin definable for his/her convenience. The pvt
network blocks still exist and packets meant for it are not allowed to
enter the internet.

Or am I wrong?

RFC 1918 address in whatever form will not be allowed/routable over the
internet, except when it is going across a VPN tunnel to another Private

This is called as DRM (digital rights management) aka content
protection. Open Source is against this philosophy and it is
discouraged. Technically it is possible to encrypt the content and
write it to the DVD - but that will create a lot of problems. But
don't do such things - content must be shared. If you prefer not to
share just hide the disc from others getting access to it.

I have used MKS tool kit  (not free though) on my very first PC with
WfW 3.11.  I became aware of Cygwin much later but by that time I had
discovered Linux.

Hi all,
I think I did not explain correctly.

I am not talking anything related to DRM or Copy protection..

There are few classes of data, which are being carried in the disks, but
must be prevented from being copied.

For instance, Personal photos which I can store on a disk as a memory  of
some occassion, which I may show people but, not allow them to copy!

I am asking for the sake of such things only.

I think protecting my privacy is not bad "philosophically".

Hi all,
I think I did not explain correctly.

I am not talking anything related to DRM or Copy protection..

There are few classes of data, which are being carried in the disks, but
must be prevented from being copied.

For instance, Personal photos which I can store on a disk as a memory  of
some occassion, which I may show people but, not allow them to copy!

I am asking for the sake of such things only.

I think protecting my privacy is not bad "philosophically".

I feel sorry if my question had breaken any of the rules or has hurt anyone
!

You could encrypt the data using GPG, for example, before writing it to disk:

My knowledge as is everyone's knowledge is gained by each battle won
inch by inch.

This process takes years. Do you think a single Google search will
tell you everything? No.

Okay now for the answers.

Steep learning curve?

Well yes. Definitely.

UNIX is serious business. I am not talking from a commerce angle. It
is serious learning. It is
 the kind of knowledge that gets serious work done.

Linux has some seriousness too as it is used in many places but it is
a good mix today.

I can say perhaps 50 50.

It is good to know that Linux is not the world. People think Windows
and Linux are the only OSes.

What about Mac? And what about mainframe eh? ;)

Anyway it is not bash. You are wrong there.

Bash is frowned upon by the UNIX community. It is full of bugs,
bloated and acts crazy.

ksh is the preferred shell. The binutils in UNIX is different from
that of Linux. You don't have so
many switches, so many colors.

It is overall much more mature and serious.

The file systems; that is where the major difference lies.

Linux has 100 ways to do each thing. Everyone wants a gratification of
their ego.

That is not how UNIX works.

Primarily UNIX means base install has gcc,make and ssh and also comes
with web and ftp servers.

Commercial interests like Redhat came long and blew such ideas to bits.

I can go on and on but the reality is that 99.9999999999999% of LUG is
still stuck in the Linux mud.

And my effort to raise people from that is not helping, has not
helped, and I don't think really
serious hackers hang around in LUG at all....

WMs of one's choice? Yes, UNIX has all the window managers that Linux
has. What is hardware intensive?

Linux is hardware intensive yes.

OpenBSD is the best OS to run on old low capability hardware.

It is very simple logic. If you want good things in life you have to
work for it.

       Bash might have a few issues, but in my opinion, a few things
are easier in bash :)

      Well, the binutils is mostly from GNU, and on Solaris(Open
Indiana, to be correct), we can use all of those binutils. It has the
gmake, gawk etc. I am not sure about *BSD, but I guess that too would
have the GNU collection in its ports. The biggest difference is the
switches. For eg.

cp a/ /data/a -r

will work in a GNU system. The '-r' switch is at the end. But by
default, the switches have to be right after the command in a proper
UNIX system. I don't know if there is an easy way to make the commands
parse the switches irrespective of their position in the command.

      I am not sure I understood this. Can you please tell what is the
difference in the file systems ? UNIX supports the UFS, ZFS etc.

         It is not about ego. It is about having options. The
classical example - Emacs and Vi. I might like emacs and someone else
will like vi. We can choose the editor that best suits our needs.

      That's because this is a LUG, a Linux User Group. So, people
tend to use GNU/Linux :). But on a serious note, for a desktop user,
who primary use of a computer is to check mails, create some
documents, spreadsheets and presentations, listen to music and watch
movies, UNIX(say, FreeBSD) is not very suitable. But on a server, yes,
it makes more sense to use UNIX.

       Yes, they tend to hang around in IRCs of their choice, where
they most probably get their answers much faster, and with lesser
noise :) LUGs are mostly for users with user land questions. Thanks

Subject: [Ilugc] port forwarding and ssh networking tricks
Message-ID: <CALDskyyzGYgZmqh3N11YuQKo9kuaWsCGCFs2d03gCy9WsGuSCA@mail.gmail.com>

I don't use ssh tricks much. But I use port forwarding a lot.

Of course ssh can be used for local and remote port forwarding. And
you can setup a VPN using ssh.

The port forwarding that I use is normally done with MODEMs which
either forward all TCP and UDP
 ports from the public interface to a local IP or you can forward a
particular TCP or UDP port.

I also do this with a firewall rule and for a very long time my
SpamCheetah product relied completely
 on TCP port forwarding for it to work.

It involves a fair bit of complexity and the main condition for port
forwarding to work is that the routing
 should be symmetric.

If you want to forward packets to a host inside the LAN, the reverse
packet path should also go through
 the same host.

Otherwise you find that port forwarding does not work.

This is very simple to understand if you know what happens underneath.

Port forwarding happens by rewriting the header of the packet. The IP
destination address and port is rewritten.

Usually only the IP address.

On the way back it has to be written back to the original value.

In other words port forwarding is nothing but DNAT and it is the reverse of NAT.

Where is it useful?

It can be used to run a web server at home or it can be used to insert
a layer of processing.

That is what SpamCheetah does. When mails land on the mail server's
interface, it is forwarded to
 the SpamCheetah appliance which filters the spam and forwards the
mails to the mail server's physical interface.

This is one example.

Other examples are load balancing, running a service on a public port and so on.

In a LAN, the gateway of all machines will be the MODEM. Which is how
things should be.

But once you do port forwarding in a machine other than the MODEM the
gateway should be
 that machine.

Then only port forwarding will work.

Then only routing is symmetric. Otherwise replies will bypass the port
forwarding machine.

In a network there can only be one gateway.

But you can always have multiple hops within the network before
reaching the gateway.

Things will still work.

This is what is needed for port forwarding to work.

Now what can ssh do?

It can do a lot to ease networking woes.

One thing it can do is local port forwarding with the -L switch.

You can setup a secure tunnel to a remote endpoint from a local port.

This is good for encryption but at the same time, local ports end up
being remote. ;)

So I wonder how secure it is.

The other thing ssh does is forward a remote port to a local port.

This is useful for machines behind NAT to run a service like ssh or
HTTP to a public IP and port.

But for this to work you will require a public IP listening on ssh
constantly to do this job.

It is little bit of a problem...

One best practice is not to allow all TCP and UDP ports to be forwarded,
rather allow just the port which is required to be forwarded.

I have always wondered that the ubuntu machine which I work with receives
lots of security updates, if so why not the modems which is directly on the
line of fire, I will start a new thread about this, instead of hijacking
this email thread.

Please remember that this is ILUG-Chennai mailing list i.e. it is
primarily a Linux mailing list.   You don't see people discussing
Linux in Windows forums and Mac OS X mailing lists.

bash  ("Born Again SHell")  is a GNU replacement for the original "sh"
in AT&T Unix.   As for ksh  IIRC, pdksh (ksh clone came later).

What is wrong with that?  Most utils behave very similar to their *nix
counterparts and by default most utils do not use color and so what is
your issue with it?

Please justify these claims.

What is wrong with Linux creating an environment that attracts
developers at large?   It gives us more choice.

The other *nix variants should strive for the same kind of attraction
for the developers to flock there and contribute.

The legacy Unix followed the "Cathedral" model.

gcc?  To the best of my knowledge gcc stands for GNU cc.

IMO, your write up on Unix history had quite with a lot of "I think")
when the very same information was readily available (as pointed out
by KG).

What is your benchmark for "serious hackers"?   How many "devel"
mailing lists are you a member of?   Those would be the place to hang
around if you are looking for a mental challenge vis-a-vis "serious
hacking."  Start commenting  about Linux's implementation of your
favorite OS topic in the kernel mailing list if you have not done so.

It is all a matter of choice.    Members in this LUG mailing list hang
around for Linux related knowledge and issues; they are here by their
own choice.

BTW, why do you hang around here if you think Linux is mud and that
most of the members here do not measure up to  your benchmark of
"serious hackers"

Please refrain from diatribe.

My two cents.

Turn on the hardware firewall if present.
Setup mac security on any multi-access device. Dont let unknown devices
access.
Use any access control list that it is capable of.

As such if one can access your dlink made modem and save to config file,
they can connect to the isp using your credentials easily.
I lost the isp password and my beetel modem was overheating and needed to
be replaced. So I just copied the hashed(?) string from the saved config
from the beetel into the saved config of a new dlink box. Copied the new
config to the dlink box and it worked :-P

If you are looking for updates, you can find firmware updates from the 
manufacturers site. But if you are really paranoid, you should buy a 
ADSL modem and flash it with one of the community built firmware which 
supports lot more features. Although, you should know, you can brick you 
device if something goes wrong while flashing the ROM (including power 
cuts).

A few years back, I risked my old modem for installing dd-wrt and it has 
been working flawlessly ever since.

http://www.dd-wrt.com/
http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/router-database

There are a few other firmwares such as OpenWrt and tomato but I don't 
have much idea about them.

Depends on your modem. Would tell you for mine, but no power, so cant
connect to it now.

They may release bug fixes. But these are low price high volume products.
Most dont have any majorly new features since the initial standards were
written. Bug fixes are rare, newer models probably have the same
codebase+fixes.

IIRC airtel has an ftp site with updates for their modems, but these are
not regular.

You are better off using community firmware on/or a higher end
modem+wireless router that has more security features/better community/
support.

Anything that can be read by a computer can be copied. You just have to 
decide how much security you are okay with. Even though your presence 
might stop an individual from copying content. You may never know what 
the computer is running, which could take periodic backups in the 
background.

The only way to protect anything from being copied by an individual is 
to plant it directly in their brain. I don't think such a technology 
exists yet, so we might just have to live with a small fraction of 
people copying the content.

Message-ID: <CACm7z1aQMt8Yz4rTuNOsLeDr+J8Gz+Yej71TPnqjd8=CLOw1iA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I have recently got an HD TV which has an HDMI port and i connected my
laptop running Fedora 16 to it via HDMI cable.
I mirrored the display using Display settings and selected " Digital Audio
(HDMI) Output" under Sound settings.

So now when i play video / audio that is stored in my laptop using any
players like VLC, Totem, Banshee ,etc. is able to produce sound on TV, but
whenever i play a online video or audio via a browser (I have FF 13 and
Chromium 17) doesn't produce sound in TV.

How can this be solved?

It may be a problem with flash player. Did you try with some other
flash player's (gnash firefox plugin or lightspark firefox plugin)?
Check if gnash flash plugin in firefox outputs sound to HDMI.

Hope this helps,

Some reasons which I believe deserve a mention

1. Distros like Ubuntu run off testing branch, if you'd use something
like Debian stable you'd have lesser updates.

2. A lot of updates you see are related to desktop software, which are
mostly feature updates or small fixes rather than security fixes. The
security fixes you receive are relatively lesser.

3. My little experience with embedded systems, which your routers
would fall under, are much more tightly bound together than desktop
distros so releasing updates for it is a relatively difficult task.

4. The companies producing these products are more of a hardware
company than software. They have little to no incentive to keep
providing regular software upgrades. They'd rather focus on quickly
releasing new hardware in the market.

If you combine all the 4 above reasons you'd see why it's uncommon to
see regular software updates to your modems/routers.
Think about how often do even smartphones receive security updates?
Mostly what you'd see are feature upgrades.

Message-ID: <CALDskyx=Jzk89645tavS=+it4co2cwM3aKgWkOOzzpdFJGGtaQ@mail.gmail.com>

By Vi, most people mean vim though nvi and vim are different from vi.

Anyway let us talk about vi the same way we talk about vim.

I am going to talk only about advanced use. I am thinking that most of
you will know
 how to use vi by now. Otherwise you dunno Linux anyway. ;)

Okay how to do simple things that are really cool with vi?

$ vi foo.txt

Now inside vi, the : mode is most interesting. Obviously this only
works under command mode.

If you want to read the output of ifconfig, then

: r !ifconfig

will get you or :r !/sbin/ifconfig

The buffer gets filled with the output.

You can also format a text file by wrapping at 72 characters in which
vi acts as a filtering agent.

: %!fmt -w 72

will do it.

Here, % stands for the whole text file you are editing and !(bang)
escapes to the shell invokes fmt -w 72
 and spits back the result into the vi buffer.

Now you can also read files.

:r /etc/passwd

will read the file contents into the buffer.

You can flip the character case using the ~ (tilde) operator.

Just move over the characters pressing it.

You can format the file and indent the loops and conditions by
selecting the region and pressing =

This only works in vim.

:%=

Or if you want to use 'v' for selecting then ggvG=

You can check the man page of a word by pressing K under the word.

You can search and replace with

:%s/search/replace/

Of course searching string is a pattern and replacement is a literal.

I took a long-ish break from this list and returned only recently, partly
because it is fascinating to note that while Linux User Group lists around
the country are more or less disappeared, ilugc marches on, and perhaps
even gaining in strength by some measure.

One of the interesting things about this list is this series of
monologue-mode gyaan mails from Girish. I wonder if there is some history
behind these, etc. Or does the list serve as a brain dump area for the
current 'regulars'. Just curious, nothing else.

If the problem was with Flash player plugin, then HTML 5 videos too doesn't
produce sound.
And Gnash performance was below par compared to flash. Any way let me try

I think you should add a disclaimer to all your mails, saying that the
content should be taken as a rant and that the literal meaning shouldn't be
taken as such. I hope my inline replies below justify that.

Is there no better way? In emacs you could change case of a selected region
by C-x C-u for uppercase and C-x C-l for lowercase. To change case of just
the following word, you can simply do M-u for uppercase, M-l for lowercase
and M-c for camelcase.

I'm not trying to prove emacs is superior, as I don't know much about vi.
I'm just trying to understand vi.

Now you are dragging me into emacs-vi battle. You can do this same way in
emacs by selecting region and pressing C-M-\ . Again I'm not saying emacs
is superior (though it may be), but asking you to stop making such
arbitrary statements.

IIRC ubuntu's default editor is gedit and it is one of the more popular
gnu/linux distros. In any case why would knowledge of usage of text editor
= to knowledge of an os? I only hope that you are joking and that intent
was lost over the interwebs.

I think, Girish started these emails with a [TIP] tag in the subject, to 
share some of what he has learnt with the list, which is great. Now that 
the [TIP] tag has disappeared, his emails remain. Although, IMO, 
recently his emails deviate in part from a technical viewpoint to a 
subjective viewpoint, which invariable brings in other members to the 
discussion.

I hope, there are beginners in the list who benefit from his emails and 
the following discussions.

But I'm really worried that beginners shouldn't be misled by his subjective
views. I keep replying to his mails whenever I feel something is absurd and
I'm clear about the topic.

Anyway, as he doesn't respond to any of the replies, I'm afraid people may
stop replying and ignore such mails. Because when that happens, the
beginners would be clueless of what is right and what is wrong among his
statements.

Can this be considered trolling?

+1  The diatribe under today's "Different UNIX variants" was a bit much.

+1 Perhaps that is the intent :(
Hopefully the beginners have the good sense to verify such information
from another independent source.

One of the replies in today's ""Different UNIX variants" certainly
came across like trolling to me.

Well, if many people in the list feel the same way, why don't we do
something to maintain the sanity of the list? The senior members or the
list owner should decide how to do this, I guess.

I'm one of those who has rapped Girish for some trolling comments. I think
folks can learn the art of sieving and culling the good part of his emails.

Hey Girish;
 This needs answer, a few more
(a) Can one run mutt, vim, mocp ie console base apps?
(b) Do look, grep, bc, calendar, feh run or do we have alternatives?

I disagree. The ARM ports allow Linux to be run on embedded hardware
which are very low in power consumption. Please don't rush to sweeping
conclusions based more on opinion than fact.

I run Debian on an NSLU2, an embedded system, which has a 133 MHz
processor and 32 MB RAM, and it performs acceptably well. I have also
run fairly recent kernels on old-ish computer hardware without
problems.

 +1. I have learnt a few thing from his emails. Though it is true that
he mixes opinions and technology, at least we get to know things. So,
as readers, we can filter out 'opinion' and just take the technology

Hi;
Could someone give some pointers to minimal hardware requirements to handle basic computing needs.
Should one upgrade and to what extent? At what point does one decide that an upgrade of hardware is
mandatory? 
Are SSD's a need or is sofware going to be minimilastcally placed on the RAM/ROM? Would an add on to
an older computer upgrade it, say a separate box!! Just ruminating! Considering the number of
computer's being churned out much like the Model T and onwards, when is enough?? Maybe I am not on the
right track.

he is not a troll - he is very talented, but is unable to distinguish

- since he ignores any attempt to flame him he is obviously not a troll.

Yes, I agree.  My concern was I was expecting some thing at least one
firmware for a quarter.  This is because I use to get a paper along with my
ISP bill to have my router switched off while I am not using it as the
Modem is just like a mini PC which attacker can take over and start up
something which might end up on unsuspecting owners of the modem.

Looks like dd-wrt is only for ethernet routers/modem and they don't seem 
to support combo devices which do DSL, I could be wrong here.

http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=452901

You can use the Beetle modem for DSL and configure it to support PPPoE 
relay or as a bridge, which ever is applicable. Then you can use an 
ethernet router with PPPoE to configure your internet and connect the 
uplink on the router to your beetel modem via a ethernet cable.

I feel, this is more than what you asked for but this is what comes to 
my mind since dd-wrt doesn't support ADSL modems. I think, the same is 
the discussion in the above link.

I have an old Linksys modem (before it was acquired by Cisco) WRT150n, I 
don't think, you get these anymore.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys_routers#WRT150N
http://homesupport.cisco.com/en-us/wireless/lbc/WRT150N

Newer models in the WRT54 series like WRT54GL run Linux themselves and 
might be easier to flash,

well, all he has been trying to do is to get some among us use OpenBSD.

some times u promote by saying your positive side & at times you decide 
to promote by demoting others, like most producers do. It happens.

If that happens, it will give him enormous satisfaction & other things 
will get reduced. He should also seriously consider giving career option 
to few.

When people see there is a chance of living with OpenBSD, then the count 
tickles.

I will try OpenBSD this week & write about it in Kaniyam :-)

You mean Beetel?   I am guessing they are mostly OEM models from
various manufacturers and re-branded.

You may have to resort to finding out what chipset it is using
(telnet, uname etc.) and then find the equivalent @ DD Wrt.   Also
consider openWRT they too support Linux "firmware" for a whole slew of
WiFi AP brands.

Also avoid top posting.

Seems MS will make some changes in Windows 8 to make their applications to
have tight  integration with the OS.

So, what will be  future of WordProcessing and Spread Sheet applications. 
Already I am suffering in compatiblity issue when more and more people give
their documents and spreadsheets in MS format. 
Also, I am unable to find any FOSS replacement for MsAccess [ StarBase and
OpenBase are inferior to MsAccess ]

What will happen on 2022 ? Ms Come with Office 2022 and Open Office will
come with New Standard ?

I think already Google docs (now Google drive) is replacing MS office

editing of odt files.

Even in the sense that he meant, i.e "people develop FOSS code because
they have an interest in improving the code as per their own

If the system configuration is very low like 128 MB RAM try Damn Small

Hi Waqar,

Fetchmail's man page says...

   For troubleshooting, tracing and debugging, you need to increase fetch?
   mail's verbosity to actually see what happens. To do that,  please  run
   both  of  the  two  following commands, adding all of the options you'd
   normally use.


      env LC_ALL=C fetchmail -V -v --nodetach --nosyslog

      (This command line prints in English how  fetchmail  understands
      your configuration.)


      env LC_ALL=C fetchmail -vvv  --nodetach --nosyslog

      (This  command line actually runs fetchmail with verbose English
      output.)

   Also see item #G3 in fetchmail's FAQ ?http://fetchmail.berlios.de/
   fetchmail-FAQ.html#G3?

   You  can  omit  the LC_ALL=C part above if you want output in the local
   language (if supported).

I hope that helps,
Kingsley

That would depend on how many services you are exposing to the outside

Not more secure, they are tightly integrated as hardware and software
and thus the development effort required to provide upgrades is
considerably more. The software is required to be much more optimised
due to hardware constraints and as thus a lot of pieces are tightly
tied together. It's unusual to see small updates to individual
software as in desktop distros.
Most of those distros won't even have a proper package manager or one
that is less functional. That would make the process even harder.

Dear Mr Bala;
 The question is rhetorical and not pertenint to a specific PC! Recently we had a box for
TV's that offers HDMI and other functionality, something like an add on. The question is why are
applications being written that seem to be more intensive, do we need them? 
The biological equivalent our  brain has not had a model upgrade for billions of years. It processes
inputs of greater complexity, greater detail than at child stage without upgrades. Rather than
hardware we probabaly need less intensive software or require applications consuming less.
Linux, Unix, Solaris were movements in that direction.
 Thanks

       Yes, true. But the whole thing is market driven. 10 years back,
an average desktop computer had 64 MB, or at most 128 MB of RAM. But
now, we have 8 GB of RAM easily. So, software developers want to take
advantage of that and write apps that consume more memory. Also, a lot
of people have started to ignore memory leaks.

        As someone mentioned in another thread, you can still run
Debian, without GUI, on a 64 MB machine. It might be possible with
other distros as well.

<speculation_and_guesswork>

Another point of view is, for companies to run and do business, people
need to buy those RAMs. And we won't buy it if we think it is a
overkill. So, there might be a conscious effort from certain group of
people to write apps in such a way that you need all those memory and
processing power.

</speculation_and_guesswork>

The process is called `learning`. Also the brain grows and constantly
upgrades itself with millions of new neural networks over it's life. In
fact your brain is upgrading itself right now when it is consuming the
information you are reading now. I know I am nitpicking and you used it in
a figure of speech, but just to set the record straight - we are not a
billion years old. The earliest humanoids are only 2.5 million years old.
Modern humans (homo sapiens) are only 0.1 million years old!

This is an interesting point. It is a chicken-or-egg kind of a problem. But
there are some limitations. We can trivialize the issue by saying that we
wrote incredibly good code (remember the gpcar, digger, prince of persia?)
which used to run on old 386 machines with monochrome displays. They had
music playing out of the PC's speaker which could be controlled only in the
notes. And this in a non multitasking dumb OS. But I I have also seen
AutoCAD rendering the famous Columbia space shuttle (came as a example
file) in an 80286 machine with no math co processor. It used to take 5
minutes to show the wire frame. The same file ships even now I think. This
file took 3 seconds to render in a Pentium machine. No matter how good the
software programmer is, they can't write code to render the space shuttle
3d image in a 80286 machine in 3 seconds. There are some limitations to
which software can be written better. It is finally limited by clock cycle
speed, RAM etc.

But there is no end to human ingenuity. There is a
famous Tamil proverb "Vallavanukku Pullum Ayudham" meaning "Even a blade of
Grass can become a weapon in the hands of a truly capable person". The
Voyager space probes which are on the edge of the solar system, nearing
interstellar space run with processor much less capable than the processor
in the cheapest cell phone you can buy. They work with 8000 bytes of RAM.
With this, the human `spirit` in them was capable of bringing voyager 2 on
a grand tour of the planets keeping it's date with each planet and is
currently `on course` at nearly 17 billion Km from home.

Arun

I understand I'm taking the topic even more farther into the woods. Hence
the edit to the subject to mark this OT :)

What you say here is partially True and partially Untrue.

True : We are being 'selected' continuously. It is not the same old design
that was "billions of years ago". Atleast, as recent as 2 million years ago
the model changed significantly to introduce the "Neo cortex", which is
arguably humanity's boon (and IMHO bane). Given our brain is our main
'niche' tool for survival it is being rigorously tested and selected. So
certainly, it is changing. But how much of the observable end results
(intelligence, sympathy, cunningness, etc.,) is acquired and how much is
naturally endowed is a topic of debate (ex: see the bit about "natural
history of Ashkenazi intelligence" -
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_intelligence ).

The "maybe every second" bit is untrue. Evolution does not happen in
seconds (unless you are talking about those species whose life times are in
the order of milli seconds... or "Hulk" ;) ). Individuals don't evolve,
individuals have the choice to adapt to (or perish due to) an ever changing
world. Those that remain 'carry forward' the process of evolution by
passing on their special traits to their young ones. Also, acquired traits
are not be passed on to the offsprings during evolution. The knowledge one
learns (which may inturn cause physiological "state" changes in the brain)
is not passed on genetically. So if you lost a limb in an accident, thank
goodness, atleast your chlidren will have limbs ;)

even allowing for poetic license in substituting 'drop' for 'as big as a

You are right. classful addressing still exists in various parts of the
Internet. CIDR is technically backwards compatible and hence allows this to
exist. Hence I used the phrase "this is not *technically mandatory*
anymore" (ie., the choice is upto you to implement CIDR / classful
routing).

This can be compared to IPv4 vs IPv6: even if IPv6 becomes widely used, it
may still help to learn about "our history" by knowing about IPv4. Yet, if
one is expected to setup a network, it would be short-sighted/foolish to
setup an IPv4-only network.

This is all I wanted to point out.

You are probably right.
But my context is based on the collective, human.
I feel `known` as from `knowledge` was more appropriate than `learn` which
seemed more individual. Might be wrong. My personal opinion. Who am I to
interpret ???????? :)

This is right now not giving precedence or resolving hosts from my
/etc/hosts file. Looking up output of ps shows dnsmasq has been started
with the --no-hosts switch (did not seem like that was the defaults when I
read up docs on the net on Pangolin).

Any pointers on where the start up config for dnsmasq is taken from? I know
I can disable dnsmasq in network-manager and go back to pre 12.04
resolution mode or install dnsmasq specifically for a custom config. To do
so for just a switch makes me feel dumb.

Does not resolve/ping a host given in /etc/hosts file.

I know the problem is due to the --no-hosts switch in dnsmasq start up. It
seems like NM is starting a dnsmas instance with a dynamically generated
config file or switches from some NM config file. Unable to figure out
where it picks it up from.

Online docs have not been of much use either. Most of them talk of
installing explicitly spawned dnsmasq or pre-12.04 type resolution by
disabling dnsmasq in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf.

ok found it http://www.tcotool.org/ , again i wanted to start by
understanding what you meant by pros and cons ?  like when you say pros and
cons you try to compare it against something which is existing it may
be proprietary ...i still do not get your question . lets make it simpler
what is the end goal you want as in writing then may be we can work

HI Friends,



Having an doubt. I am currently installed Ubuntu12.04 , Wins-7 , and Boss
OS in my laptop as dual boot up. (i.e., During system startup, The grub
will be loaded with menu and I use to select and the concern OS will be
loaded.)



Now there is in lack of disc space and in order to clean up again, I want
to remove my Boss OS from the Laptop, without affecting other OS. And need
to allocate that space to the Window and Ubuntu OS.



As it is government provided laptop, there is no DVD drive in this Laptop.



Can anyone help me out in this.

The most common rule violations (on this list) relate to' trimming of replies' .

Top posts happen less often (Should we impose the rule rigorously?....
as we have many Mods).
Imposing this is a problem because of gmail nuisance settings.

'Way too OT' is less common.

Recursively sustaining X-posts requires experience (I do it
sometimes), but it should be possible for mailing clients to have
built-in rules.


There are no rule-sets for modern mail clients, suited for glug
mailing lists. I think that will be useful.

IMO, none of the hard disk partitions should be mounted when changes
are made to it's partition table.

I use System Rescue CD [1] (installed on a USB pen drive).   It has
gparted with which you can redistribute the free disk space.  You may
have to reinstall GRUB if BOSS was the last OS installed.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] Recommend vendor to recover data from LTO4 tapes
Message-ID: <CAHhM8gDr7xvJWGBE09zStbnNWvNJmQq3rOiqpPppjahriQSo=w@mail.gmail.com>

Tape back ups using FujiFilm LTO4 media (800/1600).

Archives created using tar -cf /dev/nst0.  The tapes were fine when
the archives were created (tested by extracting random sample files
from them) but something went wrong in storage (no physical damage).

Now a few LTO4 tapes are giving I/O errors when I try to extract data
from them.   Tried dd_rescue and that too fails giving  I/O errors.

I am wondering if there is any service provider in India, to extract
the data out of the magnetic tapes in a fashion similar to "dead" hard
disks.   Please share info if you know of any such provider in India.

Thanks,

All that a public mailing list requires to send and receive e-mails is a 
valid e-mail id.

So it can never mean in a public list, if an e-mail is received from a 
e-mail id 'foo', a person exists in that name in reality.

let us say, we have 'foo' subscribed to this list as 'foo' itself.

we also have 'bar', an allakkai (????????) of 'foo', also subscribed to 
this list.

that would mean, 'foo' can take control of the e-mail id of 'bar' & send 
an e-mail id to the list creating an impression that 'bar' sent the e-mail.

'bar' don't have that much fluency in english as 'foo' has.

now, 'foo' is also subscribed to this list as 'baz'. 'foo' & 'baz' are 
the same.

'baz' doesn't exist in reality, but when ever people in the list 
receives an e-mail from 'baz' they tend to think, a person by name & 
e-mail id 'baz' sent the e-mail.

In the past, it is a habit of 'foo', to send e-mail to the list normally 
with id 'baz'.

-------------

'foo' creates an enmity towards 'qux' who is also part of the list for 
reasons known only to it & decides to flame 'qux' on the list.

a mail to the list is sent as 'baz' starting the flame.

'foo' then responds to itself substantiating claims of 'baz'. The 
purpose of misleading/ deceiving the list members is served.

then, as difference of opinion arises, 'foo' logs into allakkai 'bar''s 
account to send another mail, further solidifying the impression created 
among the list members.

-----------

such things happen, more could be done but all the constructive work 
would get lost, getting into destructive mode.

personally, the best way out is to ignore & forgive 'foo' and move ahead.

I wish 'foo' & 'bar' comes forward to work for ILUGC, despite this, 
which is all that can be expected.

The doors are still open to solve any issues personally, diplomatically 
or any other amicable means.

Personal relationship helps ;-)

but it has to be reminded to the list & ids on the list that such acts 
as per IT Amendment act 2008, might come under section 66A(c) that reads,

"any electronic mail or electronic mail message for the purpose of 
causing annoyance or inconvenience or to deceive or to mislead the 
addressee or recipient about the origin of such messages, shall be 
punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and
with fine."

http://www.mit.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/downloads/itact2000/it_amendment_act2008.pdf 
- (page 9 & 10)

----------

no harm intended. :-)

I have been part of several mailing list & is also administrator of few. 
Am aware that such things are common, tolerance is the key.

Hope I have avoided name calling as far as possible. :-)

You missed the point. It doesn't matter who it is. Name calling on a
list or a forum is a definite no-no. Period.

Yes i have seen these kind of people , just like you see different kinds of
 people in real life , my experience so far has been they live with alter
ego's so this serves as a conduit to get it  out , in one incident i have
see a person being manipulative the way you have suggested , generally i am
tolerant and in good mood and ignore all this. But looking back and
thinking about it i think its time to mend this behavior by nailing them ,
again it has got nothing to do with IT act or Law simply they need to learn
one more lesson in social behavior be it Mailing list or real world.

Do you know how to do it i mean collect conclusive proof of identities ,
one way to enforce could be is to have gpg keys and everyone signs , the
problem with this solution  just like UID is it is exclusive in nature ,
what if someone is not interested , it is too painful in implementation it
works just fine in one on one mode and what about  groups , i still have to
come across such a group which uses gpg for there communications in mailing
lists. Other problem with this idea is we have to take pain to enforce it ,
like in start we would need key signing parties to begin with once the web
of trust has been built then the communications part will come back to
normal.

but still our problem of multiple identities is not solved hopefully it
will deter the kind of behavior we are talking about.

are there any simpler ways like reading the headers .....the way i have
done it is by reading the word use pattern in mail , and identify the
individual , then go and confront the individual in person then look for
the clues in his voice tone  , his denial mode ....his expression on face
...still this does not have the conclusive proof i am interested in.

one more thing that can be done it publicly punching this other person so
much that it becomes costly (time wise) to keep up with the multiple
identities and ultimately he  gives up his alter self.

Message-ID: <CALDskyyofQEZ5+pa_hOgHS5KXx713mExT_d7Ysap_tr6ONWX4w@mail.gmail.com>

I wanted to write about this as I learnt it recently.

But Bharathi has already done it.

http://bharathi.posterous.com/one-day-one-gnulinux-command-pv

simple usage:

$ pv foo.iso | sha1sum

It shows ETA, percentage and time elapsed and many other things.

I use it in my ISO installer to show the progress of installation.

Since I use Perl nCurses I wanted a tool to show progress with my own interface
 but data should come from elsewhere in the backend.

pv has a -n switch which gave me just the percentage, so I used it and got my
 job done.

I was very happy. ;)

	thinclient in Fedora-17
Message-ID: <CACtiFJZVs61=WjCHnAen9mk-Qp6OHLBVxDeA-sC00S8fge406w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

One of the most awesome feature I found in Fedora-17 is automatic usb
multiseat configuration, which automatically configures USB docking
stations.

After some search, I came to understand that the devices available from
pluggable.com works out of the box

http://plugable.com/2012/05/08/fedora-17-usb-multiseat-compatible-hardware/
http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/multi-seat.html

Also, from the fedoraproject wiki page, it suggests for hardware from
pluggable

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/ckremoval#How_To_Test

Now I installed F-17 on my i5 desktop with both GNOME/KDE and connected a
HP USB MultiSeat t100 Thin Client and I am getting only a blank green
screen.

Is there any additional configuration need to be done for the HP T100
Thinclient.  I have been trying for this more than a year to make it work.

Any pointers or user experience on the above would be helpful.

Thanks in advance.

The green colour shows that the driver got loaded correctly in the
system. I am not sure what is the configuration required for the
device.

Good morning,

Small, high tech startup from west coast (USA) seeks Rails candidate for 6+
hours per week.

Programmers with test driven development standards (TDD) will be given
preference. So will
seasoned programmers who are eager to learn TDD.

This assignment may be best suited to someone who is already employed but
who seeks a small,
challenging outside assignment with a flexible work schedule and the
opportunity to work with
Silicon Valley pedigree.

A long term relationship is expected and the hours, with the right
candidate, may be increased.

To explore further please contact me by Skype within 2-3 days.

Thank-you for considering this assignment,

John

Hi,

Which is better to process streaming XML? (e.g. RSS)  SAX or DOM? Why?
I read up a bit on SAX and here's what the Wikipedia article says;

"Where the DOM operates on the document as a whole, SAX parsers
operate on each piece of the XML document sequentially."

Does it mean that DOM reads the whole document before processing it?
I'm trying to understand and make sense of a lot of tech jargon here..

Is your XML of unlimited size and keeps streaming in? Or is it a tiny
XML such as those RSS in news websites?

If it is continous and non-stop/ huge (of the order of 1 Mb), shy away from DOM.

Yes, DOM reads the entire XML, converts it into objects, and is very
often implemented using a nested hash-map. It is quite heavy on
memory. BUT, it is quite usefull in terms speed of development and the
ability to enrich (edit) the XML. SAX on the otherhand is read only.

DOM and SAX are not the only options. There is a StAX parser as well.

DOM is object oriented
SAX works on Tag events (read only)
StAX is a "pull" parser (read only)

Also note, now a days, there are tools, at least in the Java & .NET
world, where you supply a XML Schema, and the tool would create a
corresponding object representation (Similar to a Struct in C). You
can then import the generated code into your application and use a
list [array] of the generated objects. It can read as well as create
the XML. There won't be any code in your application to read the XMLs.
These would be externalized into those XML libraries. Eg. JAXB.

Natarajan

It is continuous stream that updates not-so-frequently.. But
eventually, in a over a span of several months, I expect the size
would reach MBs..

Initially I'll be doing a lot of reading than writing XML. So I guess
I'll stick with SAX. I don't know if there are any implementations for
Python.

Subject: [Ilugc] packets and TCP
Message-ID: <CALDskyx4W_G71o9NiBJMQ-SJ4zs4hfOoMY3ct=srG5s4154YUg@mail.gmail.com>

Now we will look at how packets are constructed, how the different
layers we always study in college
 translate to packets on the wire, in the OS(kernel) and the userland.

We will also find out how TCP works, determines bandwidth of a
physical channel and how the
 handshake happens.

I have done a lot of low level network coding both in the kernel for
packet header manipulation and
 also in userland for sockets.

A packet on the network looks like a train.

The engine is the packet header. Then the different layers are like
the compartments and the Ethernet trailer
 is like the guard compartment.

Obviously without the engine the train is useless.

Packet headers are lot more important from a coding/routing point of
view than the packet contents/payload.

And it is like this:

ethernet header -> ip header -> tcp header -> application data

And this is the packet on the wire.

When an e-mail is sent for example, the construction of the packet
happens in the
reverse
 sequence.

application(e-mail text) -> tcp header -> ip header -> ethernet header

Now the packet is pushed into the wire.

Confused?

Just think, you will know.

And the packets are handled in each layer step by step.

I took ethernet as an example.

In WiFi it is different. In the case of ADSL I think it is very
similar to Ethernet.

In the case of packets on the Internet WAN path, packets are small.
Normally 256 bytes
 or something to account for the MTUs of the physical links.

Anyway this is somewhat basic.

Now from a coding perspective I have constructed checksums with a
simple IP layer
 code, I have done IPsec ESP encapsulation and decapsulation, done some
 firewall coding and so on.

Basically at the coding level things get more detailed and challenging.

But the above idea is maintained.

There is this concept of mbufs in the BSD world.

Similar to skbuffs in the Linux duniya.

A packet header is of a variable size. It is not always 20 bytes or 14 bytes.

Packet payloads are stored in a linked list. No copying is done as it
is expensive.

Instead pointers to offsets are stored and processed at high speed in
the kernel.

Now we stop this topic and get on to the TCP world.

UDP is very much like IP. Almost like a transparent layer.

But TCP is a full implementation of a state machine with flow control.

There is SCTP but who has implemented it?

socat has it.

How TCP figures out the bandwidth is by a trial and error method.

It tries to transmit at a high speed which keeps increasing till
packet losses are detected.

Then it cuts down by half and finally figures out what speed is good.

Kind of like we business guys spend money. ;)

And every TCP connection involves 3 packet exchanges before the first
byte of payload
 is sent.

Syn, ACK and ACK ACK or something.

I have seen with netcat that whenever there is a port forwarding, NAT
or some other
 issue, the handshake fails.

This is a very useful idea.

In the IP world there are plenty of ICMP traffic redirection and error
reporting going on.

I have not properly played with it, but for understanding proper
firewall rules and for
 solving problems in networking understanding what i wrote above is a must.

I like this analogy. Easy to remember and simple.

Atleast in ADSL, the MTU on an Internet path is quite close to the MTU 
on a local ethernet. One can use traceroute to find it,

$ traceroute --mtu 8.8.8.8 | cut -d" " -f1-2,6-
....
  1  1.411 ms F=1500  1.425 ms  1.319 ms
  2  2.403 ms  2.253 ms  2.256 ms
  3  3.380 ms  3.262 ms  3.276 ms
  4  35.600 ms F=1460  36.049 ms  35.662 ms
  5  35.964 ms  36.442 ms  36.002 ms
  6  36.333 ms  35.301 ms  35.725 ms
  7  61.767 ms  61.721 ms  62.017 ms
  8  65.059 ms  61.646 ms  62.070 ms
  9  36.790 ms  37.032 ms  37.538 ms
10  39.013 ms  41.111 ms  38.754 ms

In the above case "F=1460" indicates an MTU of 1460 on the internet hop.

I am not sure if I understand. It will help if you can elaborate on what 
you have noticed which leads to the failure in TCP handshake.

An interesting article. Thanks.

Let us suppose A and B wants to talk with each other.  Then

Step1:  Machine_A will set one of the TCP flags to 1 and send it with a
random sequence number,  I have assumed it to be 1 here in this example.

A
---------------------SYN_A=1--------------------------------------------------->
B

Step2: Here Machine_B will send its own random sequence number, I assumed
it as 1 and I till add one to the SYN number of A and send it back as
ACK_A=2,  By that Machine A will know that B received the initial SYN
packet which it sent.

B ------------------SYN_B=1 & ACK_B=2 (SYN_A+1) -------------------> A

Step3: Here machine_A will do the samething of adding one to the syn_B.


A ------------------ACK_A=2 (SYN_B+1)
--------------------------------------> B

These three steps are the sole reason why TCP is called a connection
oriented connections and we can resend a packet if the acknowledgement is
not received.

Configuring Clusters -- be it HA or HPC -- is inherently complex.

There are many decisions to be made.

The information you have supplied so far is, at best, scanty.

I have configured and administered HA clusters in A/A and A/P modes
with LVS as load balancing.

There are many more questions that begs answer in the areas of
storage, Filesystems, Networks (Data, heartbeat and Platform
management) and the such.

Please give as much detail as you can including your understanding and
requirements.

Then perhaps some help can be offered

Your questions sounds immature. ;)

TCP is the protocol used in around 93% of the data transfers on the web.

DNS uses UDP. Most popular protocols use TCP.Of course VoIP uses UDP
 also because it should do hole punching to traverse NAT firewalls.

How else will you determine bandwidth?

There is no way to tell the OS your bandwidth.

At any rate certain basic ideas lot of people dunno.

Agree that you create some awareness and spike some interest in the
mailing list with your tutorial styled emails  but gross
generalizations like above would only lead to flame wars .

There are many emacs/nano or some other editor users who use GNU/Linux
. It is all about choices and by putting forward your specific taste
as the " standard " wont give a nice impression among the community .

The vi editor is a very distinct part of UNIX ideology.

It  cannot be avoided if you are a serious hacker.

Several low level utilities use vi.

Of course there is ed which is even more low level.

vipw, crontab -e all use vi

You simply cannot escape it.

Of course I am talking about real UNIX which nobody in LUG seems to know.

They only know Ubuntu, Redhat or Suse or some commercial Linux meant
 for beginners.

However it may be, every editor (or software) has it merits and 
demerits. Haven't heard of joe or nano before, seems like a good time to 
try it. It is interesting, I neither knew, joe has been available since 
1988, nor did I know, nano comes preinstalled on my fedora.

Again, please stop generalizing your opinions. You are not the only

Assume you and your brother are at home but in different rooms. You know
for sure your brother is at home and is awake and can hear you. In this
case, when you want to pass on a message, (eg. switch off the  TV) then you
can shout out the message and get on with your work.

In case you are not sure your brother is at home or is awake, then if you
want to ensure your message reaches your brother you have to ensure he is
capable of receiving the message before you can send it. So, you first call
out his name (SYN), get an acknowledgement (ACK) fro him and then shout out
the message

The first case is connectionless (think UDP) and the second case is
connection oriented (TCP)

IIRC, most implementations of TCP do away with the ACK-ACK part and start
sending the message on receipt of ACK because as you can see from above its
redundant - you dont necessarily have to ACK ACK your brothers ACK by
saying, 'oh, you are there' before you start your transmission :-).

           I am not trying to flame. But there are a lot of servers
that run Debian. And it is quite stable. So are some other distros.
But I haven't used others. Thanks

The researcher has put it the other way. Proprietary s/w companies of
the MNC kind would themselves be actively involving CIA and other
agencies for global gains. Why should the CIA bother to infiltrate
their own masters? They would have been welcomed with open arms.

A handful of corporates control the US (Most of media in the world
would be under six of them) and use all of the tax payers money for
their gains... their goals are the 'nations prime concerns'.

only you know this? Why would anyone in the LUG want to know this? As pointed out to you, this is a 
LUG not a UUG. If you want to spout opinions like this I suggest you go join a UUG. And if Indian
 ways of doing things do not suit you, you are always free to migrate.

Moved it to wordpress.

The picasa albums widget uses flash. I feel using flash in a LUG website is
counterproductive. Found a widget that uses javascript, from a quick
search. http://ottodestruct.com/blog/2006/picasa-web-wordpress-widget/
Haven't used it. Will try it and post the feedback.

What is wrong with that?  Did you become an "Unix" or openBSD guru overnight?

What is a security plugin in Wordpress.

This is just my opinion that Wordpress websites have been often compromised
to serve malware :-(

The source looks terrible with all the java script.

Try to use a plain css based design or can wordpress be good enough like a CMS?

Remove proprietary fonts:  "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial

Permit multiple themes.

Display mails on hover ?

Dear friends,

Tamil Nadu Progressive Writers and Artists Association (TNPWAA) is
celebrating the centenary year of Indian cinema by organising a movie
journey that spans the whole of Tamil Nadu. They have also planned
screenings in South Chennai and Free Software Foundation, Tamil Nadu
(FSFTN) is joining them for a movie screening! Therefore as a part of
the movie journey, FSFTN and TNPWAA are organising the screening of
?Capitalism: A Love Story? (2009), a documentary movie by the renowned
director, Michael Moore, that takes a ?people's perspective? in
understanding the global financial crisis of 2008. An excerpt from the
IMDB is given below (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1232207/):

?Capitalism: A Love Story? examines the impact of corporate dominance
on the everyday lives of Americans (and by default, the rest of the
world). The film moves from Middle America, to the halls of power in
Washington, to the global financial epicenter in Manhattan. With both
humor and outrage, the film explores the question: What is the price
that America pays for its love of capitalism? Families pay the price
with their jobs, their homes and their savings. Moore goes into the
homes of ordinary people whose lives have been turned upside down; and
he goes looking for explanations in Washington, DC and elsewhere. What
he finds are the all-too-familiar symptoms of a love affair gone
astray: lies, abuse, betrayal...and 14,000 jobs being lost every day.
?Capitalism: A Love Story? also presents what a more hopeful future
could look like.

The movie gives us a good grounding for discussing the bad effects of
corporate control of knowledge often leading to compromising the
freedom of an individual. FSFTN is also planning a discussion on these
issues after the movie screening. In this session, we would also have
a discussion on ?All India Conference for abolishing Commercialisation
of Education and Building a Common School System? which is to be held
from 30th June to 1st July 2012 at Valluvarkottam, Chennai.

Date: 24 June 2012, Sunday

Time: 10.30 AM

Venue: TNPWAA Office Hall, Near SRP Tools, Tharamani (the location is
near Thiruvanmiyur MRTS Station and is on the Vikram Sarabhai Street).

We look forward to your participation in the movie screening and the
discussion thereafter.

with so many http://en.wordpress.com/stats/ installations and frequent

You are smart enough you will figure it out :-) , i see
http://jetpack.me/about/ this as interesting development , looks like at
last they have realized on how to many money out of there infrastructure
onto test drive with it.

Now we can always doubt this initiative then it it better not use the
service/software/platform , same goes with so many other things in life
like driving , walking on the road, flying in a plane or having a Facebook

yes this can be one option , but i am sure  one of the reasons to move to
something like Wordpress is to get over once shortcomings in coding css and

Word press has multiple themes  in the back end and administrtor can enable

+1 ,opinions are currency just like any other form of expression in groups
like this or in  real life , one can express it at will  or when asked for
. Opinions once expressed on once space like Blog, Facebook are either
abhorred or liked just in the same way what is happening here , but with
Blog you are responsible for your own opinion and giving the visitor the
space to express his . Think as a book writer what is the use of it if he
writes something and he only reads it .... he too needs critiques and
accolades ..same goes with the Film makers , Song writers .

My expression  of opinion here again may  or may not have  value to few
hundred people on this list , but once i start expressing my views on a Blog

1) I am responsible for what i write and say .
2) Ready for feedback and critiques , correction in some cases , improve my
writing.
3) Get  world audience and be a Rock Star :-) , if i write well.

I think this is fairly simple thing and plain javascript should be enough.
CSS3 should be enough for the fading transitions.

And, HTML5 is a very broad term that includes a lot of new features and I
don't know which part you are talking about. The term is often loosely used
and even CSS3 is said to come under the umbrella term. Did you mean HTML5
canvas?

Netbeans is also a RCP platform.
I am currently developing a Netbeans RCP app. This is as good as the
Eclipse RCP framework.
For me, a little better because Netbeans uses Swing naively.

It is well understood, even in 2010, that the sabotage attempt on Iran's 
nuclear programme was an effort of either US or Israel.

It is improper for me to comment further on such political issues but my 
hope is that India (our beloved nation) does something about it. DRDO 
should atleast modify GNU/Linux to suit their needs, I don't know 
whether BOSS is such an attempt.

As far as I know, BOSS's focus is on localization of GNU/Linux so that
it'd become suitable for the non-english speaking public. There is not
much of hardening that I know of on BOSS. But the government could use
some hardened Linux for handling critical data. We should speak to
CERT-IN and NIC and ask them about their security practices. And as
for websites, the situation is so rotten. Recently Anonymous took down
several Indian sites very easily.. This is not good. I myself have
reported more than two instances of site defacements by some
"Pakistani Cyber Army" or something similar.

Subject: [Ilugc] Editing multiple files together
Message-ID: <CALDskyxRCD4xv=aoVwrw=nmtEDw7N993PiWa81V3=NBVTsLaPw@mail.gmail.com>

Editing is a job programmers do, article writers do and today of
course in place of typewriter everybody
 uses computers.

Doing that with libreoffice or some typesetting tool, some WYSIWYG
editor is not much fun.

I do my html, e-mail, coding, config file editing all with vim.

A year or so ago, vim added the tab feature found in browsers.

You can edit multiple files in multiple tabs.

Of course vi had support for editing multiple files but only one will
be in the window.

You can split windows and all that.

But for some reason tabs are better.

$ vim -p foo.txt bar.txt

will open two tabs.

And you switch between them using "gt".

It is cool since you can run commands for all tabs at once in colon mode:

:tabdo <command>

Also I use vimdiff to merge files.

$ vimdiff orig.txt changed.txt

You can type some quick commands, dP or something to paste from one to another.

Try these things. This is more of a simple cheatsheet or a brainless howto.

I'm wondering how different is fossconf from SFD. As far as I remember,
from the fossconf 08 at MIT (It was my first year of college at MIT and
that's where I got introduced to FOSS, by working as a *non-tech* volunteer
;)), it was more like an SFD - demo stalls and some talks.

Interesting and  nostalgic  memories come as I keep reading fossconf
08 blogs which come up in searches .

Don't use sendmail. Use postfix which is sendmail compliant.

Just use

relayhost = [foo.com]

in case you want to turn off MX lookup

in /etc/postfix/main.cf

Hi Podi,

You may take a look at CAELinux (http://www.caelinux.com/CMS/ ). CAELinux
is a live DVD Linux distribution dedicated to computer-aided engineering
(CAD) and finite element analysis.

I liked blender better than librecad.

If I recall correctly, it has better
documentation, and a more helpful IRC channel.

I hope that helps,

By default, iptables keeps track of the number of bytes and packets for 
each rule. You can use the option -vx to display them. In your case, 
based on what the script does, you can add an iptables rules matching 
the network activity which will keep track of number of bytes and 
packets. You can reset the counters using -Z option. Here is a sample 
output from iptables,

$ sudo iptables -vxnL INPUT|tr -s ' '|cut -d" " -f14,2-4|tr ' ' '\t'
....
pkts    bytes   target
623     51632   ACCEPT
111     6362    ACCEPT

Very good idea. Usually netflow is used for this purpose.

Various commercial and open source tools are available based on Cisco Netflow

Subject: [Ilugc] General concepts in clustering
Message-ID: <CALDskyztCq8e4HNBJoiYBV4nwrztYMZLNybgK4CUXPOwvQ2qpw@mail.gmail.com>

This is just a primer to clustering.

I will make it was easy to follow as possible.

Clustering is a data center concept applied from databases to servers to
 Internet links.

Basically everyone wants 100% uptime. And service availability to be insured.

But we live in Bharat no?

Where power, water, Internet nothing is guaranteed...

Anyway slowly slowly all the hi funda clustering ideas are becoming commonplace.

The same way mobile phones became commonplace.

Okay not at that level.

Let us look at some basic ideas now.

At a very high level,a protocol called CARP found in stock OpenBSD
helps us assign
virtual IP addresses to computers. So what this will do is ensure
failover and 100% uptime.

This is one layer of protection against disaster.

Another is basic link level and DNS load balancing.

Here what happens is that a DNS update is sent every few minutes using
the link that
 is up and updating the IP address of the DNS people use.

If you have multiple links, the IP address determines the route and
the link by which you
 reach the server.

This is another layer of clustering.

Now we can somehow tackle machine crashes, local cable pulls and
partial power problems and
 also ISP outages.

We are not quite done.

What about DB?

If you are running a web server that uses a DB backend how to do redundancy.

It so turns out there are few options in postgres.

Of course we also have layer 7 or layer 3 redirection at the kernel
firewall level.

With all these different tools one can successfully achieve very high
levels of availability
  without spending on riverbed or fatpipe or radware.

Anyway the Linux projects heartbeat and haproxy do it using some other method.

It is also available in OpenBSD.

But I have no experience with it.

In other words high availability is not some distant target.

But namma uru makkal will always goof up simple things when it comes to solving
 technical problems.

I know how much reliability private players give for ISP links...

Srini,

Very few turned out & that is not conducted yet.

We need to first raise hands here, if this has to happen.

NRCFOSS & its members were there, We had ILUGC volunteers, MIT students 
& many more & that happened well.

Your Tamizh fonts display very beautifully in my OpenBSD.

Okay now audacity can only remove voice track if multiple tracks are
preserved in
the format.

I don't think mp3 has support for it.

Best of luck.

You didn't mention details about which GNU/Linux you are using. I hope its
LinuxMint as you are my friend, but others won't know it until you say for
them to help you.

Girish is right, here. You can get a nice perfect result only if you
already have the tracks separately. However, there are things you can
try with Audacity, and they're listed on the [Audacity
Wiki](http://wiki.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=Vocal_Removal).

This sort of thing is usually used to get karaoke tracks, so that's a
keyword worth searching for if you want to try other methods as well.

For those interested in science, the process of obtaining different  sound
"streams"  from an audio such as instrumentals or vocals, is an active
research topic in the field of audio signal processing. You can use CASA
(computational auditory scene analysis) or blind source separation as
keywords to dig out more information.

bandwidthd  does this with nice graphics.    Most tools measure the
traffic over and interface; on an individual file basis I don't know.
 It tracks the "total" data over an interface by protocol.

More details see <http://sourceforge.net/projects/bandwidthd/>

I've tried using some of the free alternatives and found them difficult to
use after having used Autocad. It had more to do with lack of features as
one is accustomed to think in terms of features that Autocad offers. I wish
some where good enough for simple drafting. QCAD is supposed to be good but
I still had difficulty using it.

Draftsight is not an open source but a free drafting software released by
Dassault Systemes which can read ACAD files and is pretty good for
drafting. Pure 2D.

Would like to hear experiences others have ahd with CAD packages.

My father's company had no choice but to stick to Autocad. There were a few
alternatives like Turbocad which was much cheaper and was good. The reason
why we had to stick to Autocad was because of employees. The existing
draftsmen (who call themselves design engineers) were not willing to learn
any new software. When we started to interview new people, some of them
 thought that we were weird  to use anything other than Autocad and a
majority thought that it would be a career disaster for them to work on a
non Autocad using company.

[rant]
That's the state of our nation. Draftsmen who think they are engineers and
engineers who forget that any software is a tool. At least this shallowness
is currently limited to the college educated lot in our country :) Wonder
when car drivers are going to demand a BMW  to get employed.

Although I know nothing about engineering drawing(save doing it in
college) or CAD,

I will pass general remarks.

Learning something new is hard.

It is hard for me, hard for you, hard for everyone.

Only that it is less hard for certain people as they have trained
their brains for that.

Whenever we learn something new, a new channel has to form in the
brain. It is like
a needle laid on top of a clay like matter. It has to slowly form its
impression.

So this resistance is not unusual or unacceptable.

Well as long as there is poverty in our country, as long as we are not
as  well off as some
 Western nation people will always be available for work.

It is all about demand/supply.

In general I think if we pay good money you get good people and if
your company is
 known to be stable.

Subject: [Ilugc] Tools for simulating network issues
Message-ID: <CABko9NK-sgGRLK4KjVtFuoUUCU6C5Xi5E+PfbioKm6ViBPqGkg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm looking for ways to simulate network issues. Specifically, the
following scenarios:

IP
  - packet loss
TCP
  - connection establishment takes time
  - connection established, but server application is slow / unresponsive
  - piled up connections / running out of sockets

The end goal is to expose learners to these problems and be able to show
how tools like netstat or collectd's graphs will behave upon each scenario.

I don't have multiple real machines, I have 8 VMs running inside a
reasonably powerful quad core box. The box has only one network card. The
"learners" do a graphical login to the box over LTSP and ssh into the
various VMs.

Theoretically, I do see a way to achieve these by developing relevant
netfilter modules - however, I don't know if any ready made modules exist
or how easy/time consuming it may be to develop a netfilter module,
especially given I want the simulation to be highly controllable. Am I
right in my approach?

Any suggestions / pointers to tools will be helpful.

thanks,

  -Suraj

        I guess the tc tool would be of use to you. You can do
something like this:

# tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 100ms

for adding a 100ms delay to all packets. It can be deleted later. tc
lets us do a lot of things. This was just an example. A wrapper script
over tc should be able to do the job.

        Nice way to teach :) Hope colleges do something like this. Thanks

 It is pretty much a vicious cycle that needs to be broken. Businesses must
first adopt it, get their employees to learn it by investing in training
and insist no piracy will be entertained.

Usually for a quick testing, I use FreeBSD-based live CD Frenzy as a VM
(create a VM and assign the ISO image of the CD and boot directly from it
with out installing anything) and use "ipfw" to simulate bandwidth, latency
and packet loss.

Hi all,

We are trying to look into monitoring servers in Beta and Prod environments.

The stack:
a. 2(more in future) Front End apache httpd/tomcat/Liferay Servers
b. Independent CAS-SSO and SOLR servers.
c. standalone server running webservices (written in Java)
d. 2MySQL (Percona) servers 1 WRITE server and both READ.
e. Front end Hardware Load Balancers.

We want to monitor continuously:
a. All the Linux boxes and the services running on them,
b. The performance (and history) of the Java applications too.

We are exploring the best ways to monitor the whole setup including alerts and automated restarts etc. We are primarily from a development background with only basic admin experience (basic bash, installations, tuning etc).

I have researched all the usual suspects: Cacti, Nagios, ZenOSS, Zabix?..
JMX seems to be very popular for tomcat/Java.

What are your recommendations for handling this scenario? What are the pros and cons of various tools and approaches?
Please do share your thoughts on what will be a good solution. All live examples will be very welcome in educating us.

Thanks,
kc

Message-ID: <CAFe1ooKdi1YQydW633FDErhpfqGkONvfBxrAyoioHbUa4MRrBw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Gimp is limited to handling 8 bit color depth only.
Any pointers to a good alternative in Linux to handle 16 bit color depth?
I use UFRaw to manage raw file from the camera and it handles all color
depths. But I need something interactive like Gimp for post processing.

Also, anybody else interested in long exposure photography and/or astro
photography? One tool which is an absolute must is a stacking software.
This seems non existent in the Linux world. My image processing / math
skills are not good enough to write one on my own. Anybody else having any
luck on this? I am forced to depend on my Windows box to do most of the
processing work. Writing a stacking software for Linux does seem inviting
as the monsoons have set in and our telescopes and cameras are locked in...

Arun

A few days ago I wanted to watermark few of my images on command line and I
wrote this blog
http://bullet-bala.blogspot.in/2012/06/adding-watermark.htmland the
trouble which I had was that the Watermark was either very small or
very big and got out of the final image. The result of which I created a
small python script to extract the Dimension of an image and resize my
Watermarker so my water marker always looks okay on the final image.

Initial step create an watermark image and put in inside
/usr/local/src/watermark1.jpeg or whereever you desire and change the
script accordingly.

Next call my python script on command line like so

While monit helps to some extent, I found Zabbix pretty slick in
handling monitoring requirements. Please explore many templates
available. For example, there was a very good mysql performance
monitor way back in Mid-2010. This zabbix instance was required to
monitor around 250 sites spread across an Indian states for various
services. Did a decent job.

I haven't checked lately as I did not have the need.

Built-in Java Application Server Monitoring
New with Zabbix 2.0 is an ability to monitor Java application servers
over JMX directly - no need for 3rd party modules or integration
layers anymore. Monitor JBoss, Tomcat, Oracle Application Server or
any others with the efficient Zabbix Java gateway.

All the tools you've mentioned above are "systems level" monitoring
applications. While they are also useful, easy to setup and also
needed, they can only give you so much information about your
applications by measuring information about the stuff that is outside
(like the JVM's / the OS's internals).  The problem being that the
application we care about is treated like a Black Box. This may be
useful if we had a well behaving / well understood black box. But
usually we don't - even if we do, it changes.

I've found the following general pattern of practical "Dev Ops"
problems occur frequently at work:

Scenario#1:
* The ops says "From <insert system monitoring tool>, we see that
network I/O has increased since last launch. We believe that
performance can increase if our application reduced excessive fetches
and instead chose to cache or preload"
* The dev says "Well, you guys seem to be running <insert operational
monitoring / management tool> on *your* machines for management. It is
not the problem of our application. We are not at fault! We have done
nothing that increases reads. We deny it all!"

(replace network I/O with anything that cannot be pin pointed)

Scenario#2:
* The ops says "From <insert system monitoring tool>, we see that
there was a CPU spike. Any idea what happened? Here are the
application's logs from the time"
* Dev says "We don't know which function/component/part caused it. We
will try to reproduce it in the lab." (and usually, no lab can be as
hairy as reality)

At the last startup I worked (which is no longer a startup and was
serving close to half a million requests per second as of 6 months
ago), we zero'ed in on mondemand to do white box metrics measurement
to tackle the above mentioned frequently recurring scenarios. See
http://mondemand.org/ . We chose LWES as the transport, but that was
based on our setup. YMMV.

mondemand requires instrumenting one's code. mondemand also requires
one-time investment in effort towards collectively brainstorming about
what metrics we want to measure and how we will measure it by putting
the app and business in focus. But once done, the pay off is self
evident due to the black box turning into a 'white box'.

In terms of the above mentioned system tools (zabbix, nagios, etc.,) -
it is my opinion that the incremental advantage over each other may be
negligible since almost all of them provide extensibility (plugins /
extensions).

The distinct advantages of mondemand are:

1. when the app is Java and the system is Unix, there is a large gap
created between the "dev" and the "ops". Unix'y things like signals,
controlling I/O streams (logging), controlling priority or even
measuring memory used, etc., are difficult to achieve. Yes, JMX can
help, somewhat, but again JMX is a means of measuring/controlling the
"Java system" (not the app).
2. As mentioned above, white box measurement is the biggest gain.
3. App can react to outside events - not only within the system but
also networked events (ex: if you restarted the DB, the DB restart
"script" could emit an event and the app can "react" by reestablishing
the connection)

Yes, a small performance penalty for all of this - but, IMHO, it is worth it. :)

I remember playing with a tool called Cinepaint: http://www.cinepaint.org/

IIRC, they were a fork from the 1.0 series of Gimp. They were able to
handle 16-bit per channel images when GEGL was still on the drawing
board. See http://www.cinepaint.org/cinepaint-docs/ to decide if it
meets your needs.

Thanks for the link. I will check this out.
Also, got to know that 16 bit color depth is now supported in the
development branch of Gimp. Hope to download the source and compile it some
time soon.

On the following link:
http://www.heroinewarrior.com/movies.php
 please see the writeup for 'MOTION DEMO 5'. Is the process described
there what you are trying to do? If so, maybe you could use the
software called Cinelerra, available at:
http://www.heroinewarrior.com/cinelerra.php
or at
http://cinelerra.org/


Also a google search for stacking software to use in astrophotography
under linux suggests the following links:

http://exposit.disjunkt.com/
http://dulle.free.fr/alidade/siril.php?lan=en

These are apparently dedicated stacking software. Please check if they
are what you are looking for, and up the mark in terms of usability
and quality.

May be a script that monitor the Rx/Tx packet counts from ifconfig
output. You can start and stop this script along with your target
application.

Stacking in astronomy is the process of  "adding" exposures (shots). That
is, if you take 20 Nos of 2 minute exposures (shots), a `stacking` software
will allow you to combine the 20 shots to create an image with apparent
information you could get with 20X2 = 40 minutes of exposure. Your links
below are perfect.

This is a good link. Thanks.
It is very basic. Might be a good starting point for me to develop on top
of this.
This app seems to simply add frames together. Normally,

   - Individual shots need to be `registered`, that is clip and realign the
   stars in each frame so that the pixels can be overlapped blindly - Not
   Done, assumes input is already aligned.
   - Dark frame subtraction, that is, remove camera's signature noise at
   given ambient condition - Done
   - Vignetting subtraction, that is equalize bright and dark areas for a
   given camera and lens combination - Done
   - Actual stacking - New apps in the windows world have about 6 ways this
   can be done. Some of them return incredible results. < Will try to work on
   this.

So can't comment on this.


Thanks for the links

Not a good idea to advertise your mobile number on publicly archived
mailing lists.

The solution(s) depends on what do you want to be monitored.   What is
your functional requirement(s)  for monitoring desktops?

>From my individual experience with the automotive industry:
Very different. At least in core engineering. I don't know about IT. Have
dealt with people from Europe, US and even a bit in the middle
east. Everyone knows their place. They have the depth to say `I don't know`
and `Can you teach me?` I believe this attitude comes from the fact that
most of them chose their careers based on their personal interests and not
on the social pressures or the pay packet.

They have been more accommodating of what we had to offer in both software
and hardware (machines). Mostly they don't question anything which is
working. As long as the technologies work and provide the results they
want, they will not reject it based on their sphere of knowledge.

I am talking about IT. From the feedback I get from the people I know in
various countries, the people in the 'mainstream' behave a lot like our
own people. As for core engineering, I do not know much, but our guys
seem reasonably competent.

Subject: [Ilugc] Learning C coding
Message-ID: <CALDskyzU4LzGB_H5kTX1AHR_aMLBwgMhnHjRQAaWRAps_zDLsw@mail.gmail.com>

All my life I have benefited by C coding skills.

I first learnt C when I was in college but I did not learn properly.

I was not from computer science department and I was not a good student
 in certain ways.

In many other ways I was a good student.

Anyway C programming is something I started to focus much later.

Today I realize that without that I would not have been able to make a living.

How to start learning C?

How long does it take?

C coding requires knowledge of pointers, structures, callback
functions and so on.

Some concepts take time to learn as they are new concepts.

Not really programming.

However analytical ability , mathematical thinking which is
fundamental to programming
 apply to C too.

You have to know how systems programs are written.

And some style guidelines are also good to follow.

Like indenting loops and if conditions, forming comment boxes like this:

/***********************************
 *
 ***********************************/

It is very important to learn the
system() system call since it does a fork() and exec() to execute
shell programs.

For example.

$ cat f.c
#include <stdio.h>
int
main() {
   system("date");
}

$ make f

$ ./f

will print the date.

It is a great idea though it is slow and you should actually be using
strftime(), gettimeofday() or time() or some
 such thing.

But sometimes using system() is allowed.

Also you can learn some IPC mechanisms like shmget(), shmat() and signals.

And of course sockets programming.

I will write about those later.

Then it took me some good 6 more years to become comfortable.

Even today I would not claim to be a very good c programmer.

It also requires memory power as is the case with UNIX and perl in general.

afaik human memory power is only useful to pass exams (and maybe to
conduct religious ceremonies - what does it have to do with programming

         The syntax mandates more memory than a few other languages.
For eg, const char* is different from char const*. Though all
languages have it, C, Perl and other such languages needs a lot more
things to be remembered when compared to languages like Python. Also,
manpages are not available by default. So, if you forget what the
parameters to send() are, you are lost if you don't have manpages-dev
installed. But in Python(and I guess with Perl as well), you can
afford to do help(something) from the interpreter(or perldoc -f
something for perl). Thanks

makes some sense - my memory is horrible and I always have to look up
even the simplest things again and again. This actually helps my
programming because constant reference to the documents keeps me aware
of changes and new ways to solve problems. With the internet available
at our finger tips, the lack of man pages should not be that much of a
problem - unless one is in an environment where one is denied access.

hi,

I and a couple of young friends from Palakkadu conducted a two day
python workshop in Trivandrum the other day. It was a very unusual event
as students of several colleges along with IEEE and CSI conducted the
event jointly. There were talks on various technical subjects along with
workshops on python, embedded, security, robotics, mathlab etc. Our
workshop was held in Mar Baselios engineering college on the first day
and the College of Engineering Trivandrum on the second day. One college
provided debian systems and the other gave us ubuntu. Around 60 students
attended the workshop and most of them were able to complete the
assignments. Organisation was solely by students, and the model deserves
to be emulated.

          You can use rdesktop, which is a command-line utility. Or
grdesktop on Gnome. Another tool that I came across recently is
remmina, again on Gnome. Thanks

Hi

I am having a strange problem of taking remote desktop of Ubuntu 10.04 to
another box which is running 10.04 with the inbuilt vino server.  I am just
getting a Black screen and sometimes when I connect I am able to see the
screen of the remote machine however the screen is not refreshing. (i.e) My
mouse movements makes to the remote machine however when I click on a file
to open it, that does not reflect locally on the remote desktop viewer.

I did google around and found that I had to disable Desktop effects on the
remote machine which I did however no effect. :-(

I also tried disabling /desktop/gnome/remote_access/disable_xdamage with no
effect even after reboot :-(

Subject: [Ilugc] C coding tricks on UNIX
Message-ID: <CALDskyyzKnkFPRDsBzM7=aVThC6cWifp=GnF0FQPUhysVSq6-Q@mail.gmail.com>

On UNIX C is fun because C programs are meant to be run on UNIX.

And over time it evolved to run on everything.

Still UNIX is fun.

What I like most about C is its economy of expression.

Like Sanskrit. You say what you want to say in minimum words.

No beating around the bush.

And it has no library. The libc that you definitely need without which the
OS cannot run(as most applications are dynamically linked)  is very
very small.

You have to write mostly by hand.

And you have many macros in header files and header file inclusion order counts.

In C everything counts. A comma, a ; and so on.

That is true with other languages; for instance in Python, whitespace
counts. Ugh.

In C, the library that comes bundled allows few string functions, few
OS routines and
 few math functions. That is mostly it.

Now for the tricks part.

$ cat s.c
#include <stdio.h>

int
main() {
            alarm(5);
            while(1) {
                   sleep(1);
            }
}

I am not sure, you may have to include some header.

This will exit in 5 seconds since you are not handling the SIGALRM.

You also have interval timers. For instance,

$ cat it.c

 #include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <sys/time.h>


void sigcb(int sig) {
        printf(" 5 sec Interval...\n");
}

int
main() {
        struct itimerval itvl;

        signal(SIGALRM, sigcb);

        itvl.it_interval.tv_sec = 5;
        itvl.it_interval.tv_usec = 0;
        itvl.it_value.tv_sec = 5;
        itvl.it_value.tv_usec = 0;

        setitimer(ITIMER_REAL, &itvl, NULL);
        while(1)
                pause();

}

Element 14 handles India I think. Good luck getting one, though. The people
who ordered in March are just getting theirs now. Don't expect to get it
very quickly.

Yes, you can order from here:

http://www.element14.com/community/groups/raspberry-pi?ICID=ap-rpi-hwb

Problem is, there has been a tremendous amount of interest in this device
and
there is a *long* waiting line - if you order now, it may take 2-3 months
before you
get it :(

this is contradictory - you say everything counts in C, and then you say

Wrong. You will typically spend more lines/words writing a C program
than for an equivalent program in any other higher level programming
language.

Wrong. libc *is* a library and it is definitely not small -- it's 2 MB
on my F16.

If header inclusion order counts for you then you're doing something wrong.

Wrong. name resolution services (nss/nis), syscall wrapping,
locale/iconv support, dynamic memory allocation, I/O, all form part of
the core libc library. Apart from that you have multithreading using
pthreads, dns resolution using libresolv, the dynamic linker, dynamic
dso loading in libdl, name service caching using nscd, math functions
in libm -- all of them part of the GNU libc package.

Good to see India based vendors offering Linux desktop as an option.

Your post appears like it is your own personal announcement  (which it
is not but taken from the first link).
When you are quoting from some other source verbatim then it should be
explicitly stated so.

Look through the logs and see what it is being reported.   Typically,
the system/application will log what is wrong and sometime suggest a
solution to fix the problem!

I have seen server busy errors. An error starting with 4xx is not a
permanent error.

If you retry you will succeed.

Why do you want mail to go thro' squid proxy?

I am not knowledgeable there but I think that mail need not go thro' a
web proxy
 like squid.

Why don't you talk directly to the local mail server?

What is the specific problem you are facing?

Also the tone and expectation of your mail is not in line with reality.

First of all your question is too generic and you have not given enough data to
 help you out.

Secondly the tone is not something that can attract many replies.

Best of luck.

Look up www.tldp.org for Transparent proxy howto. This will enable you
control internet web access using squid and allow other protocols/
applications to get NAT'ted.

project work, I need the Eclipse and Mozilla bug databases.

I am working on the project ?Bug Assignment? where bugs are assigned to a
potential developer. Bug assignment uses machine learning approach where
the classifiers are trained using the bug reports ? fixed bug data.

I browsed websites to get the bug database. The web sites say that the
databases are publicly available and can be downloaded. But I couldn?t get
a link to download. According to the paper that I follow, they have used
the bug reports of Mozilla from May 1998 to March 2010, and that of Eclipse
from October 2001 to March 2010. Please help me to get the Mozilla and
Eclipse bug databases.

Hi Chennai Linux members,

We have launched Ubuntu powered Laptops, Desktops at affordable rates for
Indian consumers. These product models will be running on customized fork
of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS which will be more stable and will have some of our own
featured applications.

The products will be available during 3rd quarter of 2012 tentatively
before Diwali Festival.

Requirement - We are looking for software developers, customer support
execs, hardware engineers to support us. If interested please reply.

I am more inclined towards developing an open community, and we will be
supporting only Ubuntu OS.

Please check http://www.niamcomputech.com

Thanks and regards.

Thanks for the response and questions.

@Satya - We are working on everything and by July end all websites,
micro-websites, bugtrackers, application list etc will be online. Please
keep track of www.niamcomputech.com .. My name is Chetan and I am owner of
Niam Computech. You can contact me directly by emailing "
chetan.mittal at niamcomputech.com"

@Tushar - Ubuntu is inclined more towards end-user with nice UI and loaded
apps. Also, the LTS support is awesome with such a large community. Unity
HUD just rocks.

Guys, please reply as I am looking for people to join me to work on this.
Niam Computech is the first company in India to take such an initiative and
we are 100% self-bootstrapped (as of now).

No idea i am on Linux Mint as of now since i did not like Unity bloat :-) ,
also there is fun in making a custom distro and especially making it work
on your own hardware , but again there is a cost to you and your company
maintaining the Distro , which must be factored in somewhere  before you
start opening  things up.

hmm i have doubts about your claims,  i think companies like Esys and many
more tried this before , first rule in a community engagement never claim
i/we are so and so .. it does not matter who you are or what we you do  ,
your product and services  will speak about you  , also looking at the
development of the ecosystem it will happen once you have the critical mass
.

there are many other critical things to the game ....some time later.

i suggest you read this article
http://jace.zaiki.in/2012/06/26/technology-outsource-vs-open-source  to
begin with.


all the best in your journey...

Asking the same in Mozilla or Eclipse mailing list may get you faster
response. People there are interested only on those projects but
people here are interested in Open source. People here are competent
but interest may differ.

It is not a bloat.

What's the fun in it? Open source means contribution irrespective of how 
you can.

There is cost involved in whatever you start. Running these mailing 
lists cost but someone is paying for this right. Even getting education 
costs.

Everyone has different pathway to get to wherever they want to go. I 
liked the article but I don't understand how is it related to Ubuntu and 
PCs. Hasgeek guys are great. If it is community (we) but was started by 
one guy (I). I hope you get my point.

You can use Thunderbird and subscribe to gmane news group 
'news.gmane.org' .. after adding search for mailing lists of Mozilla and 
Eclipse and add these. You can also edit settings to add your email 
address on subscription and can start replying too.

I do believe that this will be a useful feature to have.

When they say "bug database is publicly available" it means you can go
to the bugs website and publicly browse through each bug report. Can
you point me to the place where they say it's downloadable?

Mozilla Mailing Lists - https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo

You might also want to try asking on their IRC channels

A website http://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/softevo/bug-data/eclipse/ says
the eclipse bug data is publicly available. Also I found that
Bugzilla provides bug reports for Mozilla and Eclipse.But the problem is
that, it shows only new format, which we can download in .csv format. I
need bug reports of longer period and dont know how to make use of the .csv
files.

That project only provides for eclipse. You can use it for your
project though. One can easily import csv file into mysql.

OK.. but it displays only new bug reports. As my project uses machine
learning approach, I need a big dataset of FIXED bug reports.

If there isn't something existing, you might have to either get it
from the people who maintain the bug tracker, or scrap it from the
website by yourself.

Bugzilla does have an XML-RPC interface that you can use to query for

Message-ID: <CAJ=JFU=L2+j5m3FmEQQM8S7hUC7XnOcq5Cn8Q_hJ4m+9h3cyMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

The Server having two nic cards, one card is having the ipaddress as
"192.168.1.4" and the other one is having the ipaddress as
"192.168.2.55".All client systems having the ipaddress range
"192.168.2.0/24",and
the client system are accessing the internet through squid proxy.Now i want
to configure the "Mozilla thunderbird" in all client systems.But it cannot
accessing through squid proxy.

  Now i made the proxy as transparent,still it was not working and i also
done the NAT through iptables by

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to
192.168.2.55:3128
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT
--to-port 3128

   here "eth0 ---> 192.168.1.4" and  "eth1 ----> 192.168.2.55". Please
intimate where i am going wrong.

 What type of changes i want to make the entire system working fine.thanks
in advance....

from what I recall, you need to open the smtp and pop/imap ports in your
firewall.

What is your Thunderbird configuration ? Do you expect thunderbird to 
contact SMTP/IMAP/POP3 servers on port 80 ?

Typically, SMTP/IMAP/POP3 servers run on a non-80 port. Unless, you 
configure thunderbird to use a HTTP tunnel, by specifying a proxy. Have 
you done that ?

If your proxy supports HTTP tunneling, you should test whether tunneling 
works on the destination host/port in question. Refer to the following 
link to run your test,

http://www.anta.net/misc/telnet-troubleshooting/http-proxy.shtml

Unfortunately, I don't have a proxy setup right now to give you the 
steps myself but I am sure the link above should suffice.

The second NAT for connections coming on eth0 is not needed.

Create NAT rules for -i eth0 dport 25 (SMTP), 110 (POP3) and 143
(IMAP) to the outgoing IP address... Then try telnet to your mail
server port 25 and see if you are getting a SMTP response.. Similarly
verify POP3.

Are you able to ping the internet from the server itself? This will
make sure your routing is correctly configured on the server. If not,
set default route as eth0.

Hi I am not here to fight. We all are biased to something what we like 
or dislike. I just said few good words about Ubuntu. Isn't Ubuntu a 
Linux distro? Did I criticize other Linux distros? I don't understand 
how come I have antagonized a good part of LUG community. Please explain?

I would have appreciated ILUGC if guys would have come forward asking 
that if Niam PCs can support Fedora or Mandriva or Gentoo or Mint etc 
rather than fighting over if someone is biased towards Ubuntu. Is it a 
crime to pick Ubuntu over others?

@Kenneth - Which distro you use often? And why?

Speak for yourself. Why should anyone get antagonised that someone is offering Ubuntu PCs. If you dont use it or like it, dont buy.

No need to kick up some havoc on the mailing list with assumed intentions of others.

certainly not. But it is not very nice to say it is the best, most
popular distro with the best support and community.

fedora - it has the latest libraries for my type programming which
ubuntu does not have. Wife and kids also like it as the distro treats
them well (all of us had our honeymoon with ubuntu and got fed up).

I did not get antagonised by him offing ubuntu - dell is doing it, I am
not bothered (I wont buy of course). What antagonises me is the tone
used by ubuntu fanbhois - that ubuntu is the best greatest etc etc.

+1 and as far as I can speak most of the community members do hate the
unity desktop . Distro watch still shows that linuxmint is the top 1
distro for more than 6 months . Agreed that distrowatch doesnt reflect
this community as such but it does reflect an active community
interested in linux distros .


>Ubuntu is inclined more towards end-user with nice UI and >loaded apps

Linux mint directly beats ubuntu in this aspect and Fedora /
Mandriva/Suse/PC Linux do have the same "friendly UI  with loaded
apps".

Boys please respect Linux community all these are Linux derivatives. I 
am inclined towards Ubuntu, Kennedy is inclined towards Fedora, and 
Pavithran is inclined towards Mint. What's the big deal! Buy Ubuntu 
oriented PC, uninstall Ubuntu, install Mint/Fedora whatever, use our 
open source drivers (as they will be written targeting Linux as 
generic). OR write your own drivers for your fav distros and give back 
to community.

Fighting over distros doesn't help community.

We launched Ubuntu powered Desktops and Laptops because we felt it is 
right for community and our business. Full stop.

Linux Mint shares Ubuntu's repo. isn't it?

Also by default plays MP3 etc., Isn't it?

Then is there something to wonder?

Linux mint is more "fully loaded " than ubuntu with all codecs etc in
buillt into the distro . And its not always based on ubuntu . There is
a Debian derrivative called LMDE .

If you want your network to be behind firewall and connect to external
network for HTTP, SMTP etc, you need to do SNAT(in your setup) with
POSTROUTING chain and enable connection tracking

Subject: [Ilugc] very simple profiling tool
Message-ID: <CALDskyxTgdCFHUabPTD0Po3_fWZ65GSFAND++SAfvH6yf2aO9A@mail.gmail.com>

All of us wish to profile our code or even utilities.

Not always but in rare cases where timeliness is of essence.

Just do this.

How long does a DNS query take?

$ time dig yahoo.com

What about mx query?

$ time dig +short yahoo.com mx

Actually for us to use the mx we have to query the a record of the
 mx pointer which is actually a domain name.

In general monitoring is necessary to know whether a daemon is
 constantly running.

To do that I use monit though mon also may be useful.

I will send a separate mail.

Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu. Check 
http://www.linuxmint.com/oldreleases.php

LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition) is separate distro from Mint team which 
is based on Debian than Ubuntu.

commercial BSD is not free BSD.
And netfix obviously is talking about very specific hardware and requirements.
Here we are talking about some other kind of h/w.

If there are problems with the benchmarking , then they should be rectified.
But what other options do we have apart from actually doing it ourselves?
Personally I know, free BSD does not perform as well as say Fedora on
X86-64 for my requirements :)

Please follow the mailing list guidelines
(http://www.ilugc.in/content/mailinglist-guidelines) and do not
cross-post replies across lists. The post you have replied to on ILUGC
list wasn't posted to ILUGC at all and it makes very little sense to
those here.

rectified/worked upon  since by the PTS team.
