Thanks. Now it works with Python3.

As I need only the coursera course catalog, I removed the code required for
sharedcount service.

Subject: [Ilugc] [Help] Teach me Rails deployment on production
Message-ID: <CAN4GZG+_CywLz_0xmTx8bK9N18HS3_40e6yLpbHBvrtQmrqS-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Guys/Girls,

I want to learn all (enough) about deploying a rails app in production. I'm
a rails developer myself.

Following are the specifics I want to know.

* How to deploy to cloud specifically digital ocean
* Difference between nginx and apache web servers
* About application servers, passenger, unicorn and differences
* Load balancing setup
* File Storage Setup (AWS)
* Database setup with master slave replication
* Centralized log management
* Auto building the environment using chef
* Managing these systems for best performance and uptime

I know parts of all these above concepts I've mentioned, but don't know how
they work as a cohesive unit. I'm a fast learner and I would like this to
be a face to face session. We shall meet someplace like coffee day. I'll
buy you coffee and pay you by the hour. I don't want you to teach me for
free. I know every one of these is huge if we dive deep, I don't want to
dive deep, I want to have a right overall picture to start with.

Please send your name, availability, coffee day convenient for you and
hourly rate.

Thanks

Hi friends.,

    Which technology is used to maintain the user browser or machine
identification ? After removing all the browser history and cookies ?


Real Time Scenerio:


             I am login to axis internet login through my machine with
firefox browser,during the first login it will ask the security
question.,after that I removed all
my history and cookies of my firefox browser.But again login to my axis
internet banking from the same machine,It couldn't ask any security
question.


             While accessing from different machine at the first time,it
will ask the security question and all.,but two different systems are being
accessing same internet.


              Which technology is available to maintain the user
credentials after removing all the client browser histroy and cookies.,

 Thanks in advance

Hi Mari,

This concept is *Cookie* its stored in file in your local machine. Until
you clear browser cache or otherwise accessing new browser ask security
question and create the cookie file. Its support all programming language.

I think it will not be based on IP address . because we are using dynamic
IP right.

We may have same IP for our house today if we switch then it may be to next
house.

hi.,viswaprasath.,

         It isn't on ip based.,let us consider I have single internet
connection but two different laptops connected with that internet.,

I am accessing from different laptops.,but in the server end it will reach
from the same ipaddress na..,

        I am accessing from some other laptop not belongs to my own.,that
time it will ask security question for first login.,next attempt and
further more logins it won't ask for the same like my own laptop.,

"credentials" wont be saved into cookies without the user consent
specifically to secured sites (https). If any https site is doing it then
its wrong and can lead to potential threats.. think of such site you are
accessing from internet cafe....websites generally stores your prefereces,
choices, things you searched etc . but not the security questions, password
-- unless you agreed to do so.

this identification on server side.,If they are maintain in client system
browser means.,after removing the cookies and history.,it must ask the
security question na..,but it won't ask..,

            I think my question make it sense for you.,if you have any
query let me ask..,

Hi Marikkannan,

*>>>I my perspective,they should maintains this identification on server
side*
Server knows everything about the user as such (passwords, id, last access
time to name few- but not which browser password/ security question etc
stored ).
for instance if I assume server stores all details - then details should be
visible from any of the browser on any computer.

*>>>If they are maintain in client system browser means.,after removing the
cookies and history.,it must ask the security question na..,but it won't
ask*
If you clear the browsing history/ cookies, all stored recored goes off -
it will again ask to enter details if you again access the site - try one
more time yourself.

Yahoo! and Google groups (mailing lists) are also free.  The name can
be yours but you have to live with their domain names.

We have exactly the same thing you are looking for. We just started a new
company 'ThinkFOSS', which does Open Source training, builds Solutions and
provides an online portal for mentors to meet mentees on Open Source
topics. The developers are basically students doing their CS engineering
and part of FOSS at Amrita.

If you want to give it a try, you can create a new solutions request at
http://beta.thinkfoss.com/#tf-task so that one of our admins can check the
feasibility.

I also welcome other devs/mentors in this list to give it a try, and post
in one or two courses for a considerable fee. They payment gateway is not
up as of now though.

Thanks,

Dear All,

For one of our products we are working on designing a gateway/router (wifi).

Currently for our prototype i have made a raspberry pi as router. I am
looking for a cheap and reliable alternative since this router will be
working 24/7.

Kindly suggest some alternatives.

I had similar thoughts but abandoned the idea.

Raspi -- hobby/home/proof of concept use OK but it  is a *bad* choice
for commercial productising.    On alibaba.com, you can find embedded
boards (small form factors) with 4 Gigabit LAN ports + mini PCI-e
slots to stick your Wi-Fi card.  They are about $150 and upward.
PCEngines and Soekris boards have a small form factor but they are
more expensive.

You can try mini ITX boards but the form factor may not be attractive.

Out of curiosity, what is the USP of your product when compared to the
mid range APs (5-10K)?  From my experience, most small businesses
settle for the sub Rs. 1000 products from the likes of TPLINK and
DLINK.

HTH,

This a very broad question, please narrow it down to specific(s).

Besides, it is a commercial/proprietary product with no correlation to
this mailing list; unless, you are looking for an open source
alternative to Dell Sonicwall.

Anyway, I suggest you decide which model is suitable to your
requirements, download it's brochure/white paper and study it and then
ask your question(s).

Best,

Look at getting Buffalo/TP-Link routers. They run opensource like
OpenWRT, Tomato, Svensoft firmware etc. Can download those distros and
customise. These boxes come at $40-50 for 802.11N and $100 for
802.11AC versions.

Way back in 2010, I had installed a few Buffalo AP but they suffered
from heating problem.  Symptom - they would stop showing up in the AP
list.  A whole bunch of RMA replacement did not solve the problem.
Power off and allowed to cool down and they would work fine.  I hope
their current crop of APs have solved this.

In future, if you can send the final agenda few days prior to the

Our Concept works fine with Raspi. As your said we cannot go for a
production with raspi since its development board only.

Our product is home automation. We need cost effective and a quality
solution.

I have already worked with digi routers, they seems to be rigid and of high
quality.

Just need to know any other alternatives available in dlink, netgear etc,

Subject: [Ilugc] Suggestions for NFS server configuration
Message-ID: <CACEMYxonobnMx3Zdgz_GFX9-NOJtujOk=nvsXF2=i-aDxcuzeQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've not set up an NFS server from hardware for many years, so please bear
with any naive questions.

I need to set up a server to replace an old Dell Business server (SC 430)
running Ubuntu 14.04.02, which has stopped booting up now. It had 2 500GB
drives, daily backup from drive 1 to drive 2 using rdist-backup. Data is
written only to 1 drive. It has 4GB RAM. Small subnet - 3 fixed NFS clients
(2 desktops, 1 fixed laptop) and 1-2 floating laptops that are brought in
occasionally.

What would be a really good server setup to replace this? OS, software, &
network installs/configs are not a problem, but I'd like to set it up once
(well, OK a few times!), and then leave it to run for years.

I've only used servers with internal hard-drives. Are there reliable boxes
(chassis?) which will let me re-use the 2 SATA HDDs? Is a
CPU-RAM-network-only box + SATA box config possible? And the Dell case is
really nice, I'd hate to scrap it if it can be re-used. The motherboard has
been dying for some time, I think, so it may not be salvageable. Only 2 of
the 4 SATA connectors work.

To spice up this problem a little further. Most users are already getting
their home directories through NFS. Would it make sense to convert the
desktops into thin clients? No hardware replacement here, just
distro/OS/config.

Many thanks in advance for all advice & suggestions.

Regards,
Sameer

Are the disk still good?  You could simply transfer the hard disks to
another machine and boot from them.
An equivalent server from Dell/HP/Lenovo is a good start.  Suggest up
the RAM to 8GB.

A workstation grade (really good SMPS) ATX chassis should do it.
Avoid the cheapos units.

Most Dell/HP/Lenovo/<etc> boards are proprietary with proprietary
chassis.  It is unlikely you can use it with a standard board from the
market.

I am biased towards to Supermicro boards, their form factor is
industry standard.

Yes, they are OK. They've been moved once before, from a desktop to this
donated server.

OK, makes sense re. the RAM. Server boxes may be expensive, hence my query
below. Budget is around 20k. I'm OK assembling high-quality components, just
need advice on what to get.

Right. We are now using Antec SMPS, though not boxes.

One box/chassis for cpu/ram/network-cards + separate box(JBOD or something)
for HDDs. Connection through SATA cables, separate power.

That would indeed be helpful for future-planning.

Apparently Supermicro's not popular in Chennai. I see only one authorised
distributor in Ashok Nagar - Netweb Technologies.

A 20K budget will not get you much of server grade components.  You
may have to settle for desktop board + CPU.
ebay.in may have some offers from IN based vendors, you can check for
"out of lease" items that usually go for 30-40% of the original price
and you get data center grade hardware.
I have also ebay.in list items from US vendors where you pay in INR
and the price includes shipping and custom clearance.

Cooler Master has a few chassis w/o SMPS.  My favorite is Elite 311
(if you can get it).  There is space for about 5 HDDs  mounted on a
removable cage.  Makes servicing easier.

I have done business with Netweb.  RMA  and onsite service is good.
Their price is a bit on the higher side.  Alternately, you can try
Intel resellers.

> written only to 1 drive. It has 4GB RAM. Small subnet - 3 fixed NFS clients


Maybe our config/setup is helpful for ideas, now or if you grow :

We use mdadm raid1 for all our boxes, NFS servers included.
It buys days of time after losing a disk before we have to replace it.
*Rdiff*-backup is used daily to another box, for box/site disaster and
hist archiving.

If intended for datacenter, then we now prefer Supermicro 1U small servers.
Previously we did use the cheapest Lenovo's but they would get wedged
sometimes, and require travel to DC to reboot.
Supermicro is no-frills, has IPMI for remote mgmt, and worked well for
us for years.
Downside is no hotplug, so have to bring box down for few minutes to
replace bad drive.
2x2.5 drives fit easily on the chassis we chose.

We use NFSv4 to export spare disk from all boxes to all boxes, with
home dirs local to each box.
Users are asked to keep dot files in home dir or any files they do not
need backed up.
Each is given work dir on nfs, visible on all boxes - these are backed
up by replicating periodically.
All network dirs are accessed through symlink, so recovery is manually
updating it to the working copy.
Sometimes we iscsi-export partition from diskrich box to diskpoor box
needing faster local disk than NFS can do.

Maint work is rare, triggered when hourly monitoring scripts report
failed / nearly full disks.

OS is Centos7 as it scales to enterprise quality - minus the
enterprise SAN cost :-)
Tightly controlled and uniform network, so just plain local Linux
security suffices.

Message-ID: <CA+TDRNNBuD56bVvz-2cHAsZfnf7naBVfF9jn0-2mQ5+YDra25w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

We have a few full-time permanent devops positions available.

About the work

Our applications handle all the way from front office trading to back
office portfolio operations for securities markets in North and South
America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. From OS to application, we have access to
the source code, since it was either written in-house or is open-source. We
intend for team members to spend half their time on development and the
other half on operations. Due to the markets we are deployed in, and since
we operate our own code, the operational part of the job involves working
in shifts. During each shift cycle about 20% of the time would be spent in
an early shift starting 4:00AM and another 20% would be spent in the late
shift ending 12:00 midnight. The remaining 60% would be in fairly normal
shifts.

Responsibilities

- Operations monitoring and troubleshooting. Dev-Ops work ratio is 50:50.
- Maintain existing and future custom application code and configuration.
- Participate in regular deployment of code updates.
- Learn on the job and explore new technologies with little supervision.
- Development work on open source projects like LibreOffice/Thunderbird
based on internal needs.

Requirements

- Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or equivalent work experience.
- Good coding skills in C++/Golang with 0-2 years experience.
- Good knowledge of GNU/Linux operating system.
- Ability to research technical problems and solutions online.
- Excellent communication skills.
- Willing to work in any shifts within 4:00 AM IST to 12:00 midnight IST.
- Strong desire to contribute to open-source projects.

Benefits & Perks

- Starting base salary for fresh graduates is 5-8L based on ability.
  For those with work experience, salary will range higher, based on
ability.
- Bonus based on performance.
- One month paid vacation for first year, it can go up to two months from
second year onwards.
- Initial posting based in Chennai but after one year (and proven record of
responsibility) may
  choose to work from home anywhere.


If you are interested in applying for this position, email your resume to
careers at ldcs.co.in with a subject line LDCS-firstname-lastname.

Dennis

Message-ID: <CAHPYoWRPZDJ1UHmBJFb7TM1V0D5tVQFqbCwBRtfgyzct-rVuEw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This year at PyCon India 2015 we are holding Dev Sprints as a part of
the conference.

In case you are confused or if we sound too pretentious, think of Dev
sprint as having a good time, coding hands-on with your fellow Python
programmers. The atmosphere will be that of an intense one, extremely
focused on projects, with mentors hanging around to help you overcome
any roadblock that you might face. The usual outcome of these intense
sprints are patches, bug fixes and numerous upstream pull requests
from almost all the participants.

Been dreaming about contributing to open source projects? Well, look
no further because there won't be a better chance than this. The
Sprint will be held on Oct 2nd from 9AM - 7.30 PM on the 1st floor of
the conference venue.

We have started off with the registrations of the PyCon India 2015 -
Dev Sprint. Participation in Dev Sprint is completely free but the
venue can accomodate only 150 participants. So, We will accept
participants on a strictly First-Come, First-Served basis. Fill up the
google form[1] to register to Dev Sprint as a participant. It's
compulsory for the participant to have PyCon India 2015 ticket to
participate in Dev Sprint.

Last date of Registration - 24th September 2015.

Here is the list of projects that will be participating in Dev Sprint[2]

Dev Sprint is open to all. The only condition is that you need to have
registered for PyCon India 2015. You will need to show the PyCon India
2015 tickets before attending Dev Sprint.

Some of the tabs have nothing in their section.  Assuming it is some
kind of CMS, activate the high level tabs when you have content under
them; empty sections are ok with draft/site under construction but not
when it is in production.

Thanks! Its public to the internet as of now. We are in its early initial
stage, and http://www.thinkfoss.com/portal/student/viewAllCourses.php shows
me that we have 11 courses as of now and mentors. I am expecting more
mentors from this list though.

Mentee enrollment is <= 20 as of now. Looks like it will take a bit more
effort to gain momentum.

http://wordpress.com offers a easy solution, its free too... If you want to
map your domain on it, its just $17 a year I suppose. Much more better than
other companies that support wordpress.

Hi all,

I am working at a software development agency called Red Panthers
<http://redpanthers.co>, which is based in Cochin, Kerala. We have worked
with clients from over 21 nations, handling complicated requirements and
helping them scale their business. Our most frequent tools of trade are
Ruby on Rails (2.3 - 5.0 (yes we work even in the not released version of
rails)), git, RSpec, Redis, sidekiq, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Sinatra, Cucumber
and Angular JS.

We are on the lookout for developers to join our team. So if you are
interested or know anyone who would be interested kindly drop an email with
an introduction, and your github profile or resume to *careers at redpanthers.co
<careers at redpanthers.co>*

We work exclusively in Ruby on Rails, so we expect the developers who join
us to be passionate about rails as well.

cheers,

For open source Attendance Management you have two options. Either use an
ERP software such as the one Arun S suggested. Or use a time tracking
software such as the following:

TimeTrex: Payroll, Time Sheet, Job Costing... etc. You can download the
Community Edition licensed under GNU Affero General Public License from
SourceForge. http://sourceforge.net/projects/timetrex/ Forum

eHour https://ehour.nl/ : This is more oriented towards tracking time spent

I have used it in my company; it does the job for attendance and reporting.

This looks interesting (surmise from screenshots) and appears to be a
better fit for a consultant shop (multiple simultaneous project work).

Yes. looks good apart from typing error.

If you want to access your project's web-UI which you were intended to via
https://192.168.0.25/ from Windows machine then you have to
allow connections to port 443 in CentOS server.

Also disable selinux for now.

Here is CentOS wiki on iptables.

Looks like there is some time sheet functionality in Apache OFBiz. You will
have to evaluate this to see whether this will serve your purpose.
http://ofbiz.135035.n4.nabble.com/Add-time-sheet-to-Invoice-td4649229.html#a4649230

Keep in mind that installing, configuring and maintaining any ERP software
will take significant effort. The time sheet / attendance module is likely
less than 2% of what an ERP software can do. Unless you are planning to use
some of the other modules of Apache OFBiz, this is like driving a bus to
drop your child at school.

Dear all,

We are happy to announce a security contest for school students in India
called Junior InCTF

This is the *first time* in India that such a contest is being organized

South Korea etc.

We plan to make this an annual event just like InCTF
<http://inctf.in/> (Security
contest for for college students) that we launched in 2010.

We wanted Indian school students also to get exposure and interest in the
area of cyber security. Hence this contest for school students.

The contest will be 2 months long and will be fully online. We are
providing exciting prizes as well (laptop, tablet, drone, raspberry pi,
books etc). We provide online support for students who need help.  Learning
materials will also be available online via the our website.

If you know any one studying in *schools in India* please ask them to
*register* via
  https://junior.inctf.in/


*Registration is now open*

Please inform the schools where you studied about this contest and it would
be great if you can follow up and get students registered.

*A poster about this event is at *
     https://www.facebook.com/cybergurukulam


Below is a message you could share in WhatsApp groups
