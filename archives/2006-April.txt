Chances are content would have been sent already before the headers
thats why its failing.  Also, its always advisable to put META tags in
the HEAD section of the document.

Like in the case of say, specifying the content type of the document,
if the META is not within the HEAD, browsers would reload the document
internally for using the specified content type.

.... am also worried that something like what happened in bangalore
will also happen here. I do not understand why showing 'face' in meetings
and 'contributing' (a very narrow definition of contribution at that) to the
FOSS movement are basic requirements to even post ones views in the mailing
list! Surely, no FOSS manual says so!

I have had the unpleasant experience of a 'bar' challenging me offlist to
appear in an ilugc meet if I have the 'b****'! And I suspect there was even
an attempt to remove me from the list. I sincerely hope the requirement of
'showing face' is not to empower the 'bar' identify individuals and impose
his physical might on them!
this is a very serious matter; who on earth attempted such removal?
please make a detailed "list of these events", post them in the list
next, we can discuss in the list why such a person behaved so and possibly 
issue
a strong warning.
the list is not anyone's private property

Dear friends: I have been seeing long thresds of technical / non-technical /
other (?) discussions. I am rather a new entrant to ILUGC, albeit with
official mandate to interact with anybody and everybody who is ineterested
in FOSS and in whom FOSS is interested. While I understand the passion many
of you have, let me quote (you must have had it umpteen times & I hope I
have done it correctly)

"Where is the knowledge lost in information
  Where is the wisdom lost in knowledge"

In this computer age, I am tempted to add "Where is the information lost in
data and where is the data lost in bits and bytes (and postings and mail
threads)".

As some of you suggested, let us give and meaningful subject line so that we
could decide whether to read thru or give it a miss. If I have to alert
specific persons [e.g., Raman or Sakthi or Bharthi], I would rather send a
mail to the personal id. If I am seeking some of your help in organizing
things, initial mail might be to the group, but I might switch to individual
modes.

We could possibly limit the thread level to , say 10?. Am sure, most of us
want to voice our opinion but I feel we need not react to each and every
matter raised. We had all seen the ads where people were getting submerged
in the mire of plastic bags and garbage. Let us not sink in the ocean of
words. Having been in tech/trade information projects (interacting with few
thousands of subscribers -- all before the advent of emails and internet), I
know how one could get buried deep in irrelevant info. The problem is what
is irrelevant for me could be extremely important to somebody else!

Thanks for patiently reading thru this mail -- I do not want long threads of
comments to follow this mail.(Am I being a megalomaniac thinking that
comments will follow?)
With best wishes, Srinivasan.

Dear all,
On 31 Apr 06, me and Thayagurajan conducted one day Seminar at Shri
Ramanujar Engg College, near Vandalur, Chennai.
We started with intro to FOSS, showed a live cd and did an install of
debian in the Forenoon. As usual there was good interaction with
students.

In the Afternoon I spent about two hours with 8 of the 3rd year
students with hands-on sesssion.

The students seem to be very interested and hope they will continue
exploring FOSS.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank management,faculty and students of Sri
Ramanujar Engg College.

Raman.P

Inpractical. No where I know a list that restricts   the level of
thread. In forums, mods may lock a  thread. Thats different.

IIRC,

1. It's skull
2. LDD 2nd Ed is for linux 2.4, are you compiling the driver against 2.6 ?

Check the snull-ex14 in my device.drivers-1.0.tar.gz
or .tar.bz2 from my downloads section:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads.html

I have also put a README on how to use it.

Nope, he is refering to the snull network loopback
device driver.

Subject: [Ilugc] Problems with Kernel 2.6.16
Message-ID: <442F5E60.6070205@gmail.com>

   Hi Luggies,
   Yesterday i tried to update my kernel from 2.6.14 to 2.6.16 through Yum.
   The download and installation went fine. When i rebooted the system, gRUB
   did show me 2.6.16 option. When i select and start the booting, the INIT
   screen comes up and after it shows ...

   " Starting: Storage.. Network.. Audio.. Done" i

   Thent has to switch to a GUI screen, which it does with my 2.6.14. In this
   screen, the individual stuffs being initiated like " CUPS, HAL daemon, etc
   etc.." are shown and it proceeds to the Login Screen.

   But with my 2.6.16, it stops here after the INIT screen and the screen
   blinks ending up with a "X" like pointer. It doesnot get into the GUI
   screen. It hangs there. I tried interactive startup by pressing "I" but
   nothing happens with that too.

   I have a NVIDIA GeForce fx-5200 AGP Video card which works fine till now
   and a P4 1.8 GHz Procs. Is this due to the 3D card?

   I saw vasudevan's mail long ago about some problem in FC5 with NVIDIA
   card, is this anyway related to 2.6.16 ?

   I do know the first reply would be "Compile and Build the Kernel" :D  But,
   i do want to know why this kind of problem occured. Can i post
   same/similar query in LKML if its mainly with 2.6.16 ?! :)

Test 1: At this instant, can you press Ctrl+Alt+F1,
login to console, and check if you can use the system?

Test 2: Can you boot into console straight-away and
use the system?

Can you probably dump your dmesg output to
http://pastebin.com and give us the link?

Probably, the driver?

Looks to me more like the X configuration for a
different driver in the 2.6.16.

When you do a kernel upgrade using your distro package
manager, do they retain the previous kernels that are
installed? How does Debian/Fedora Core/Ubuntu/any
other distro handle this?

I always compile and install a stock kernel.

Gentoo follows a "slotted" system. When I tried to upgrade my kernel to
2.6.16 I had both this and 2.6.15 as options. Only when I was completely
sure that my newer upgrade was working fine, I unmerged the 2.6.15 version.

I guess Debian/Ubuntu also retains the older kernel like Gentoo.

   When I upgrade my kernel from 2.6.14 to 2.6.16, it does retain the older
   version. Thats why I am now mailing the LUG ;)
   During booting.  GRUB offers to boot in either of the two, though by
   default the newer one satrts up !

Firstly, just to help people trying to install custom kernels on
Debian, the right procedure is to use the following steps:

1) Install the kernel-package package (The doc provided is excellent)
2) Configure the kernel as you please, and make
3) Run make-kpkg in the top source directories. A sample command line would be:

make-kpkg --rootcmd fakeroot --revision custom.1 kernel_image
(You will need write permission in the parent directory)

I have some out-of-kernel modules for which Debian provides the source
as a package (which is good, as upgrades occur automatically). To
build them as well,

sudo make-kpkg --revision custom.1 modules-image

This will generate deb's for the kernel and a deb each for each
third-party module in the parent directory. Just use dpkg -i <debs> to
install them. This does everything right from installing the kernel,
updating grub etc. Each kernel is a *separate package* (unlike other
packages, where there is a single package with different version
numbers), and so installing a new kernel does not do anything to the
existing ones. The only destructive changes made are changing the
default kernel in grub to the one installed. So, you can still use the
other kernels.. If you don't like a kernel, just purge the
corresponding package.

It has been long since I have used other distros. I used to make &&
make install for non-distro kernels in Fedora... may be there are
cleaner methods which cooperate better with the distro package
manager.

Regards,
Ramkumar.

Hi Parthan,
You have to rebuild kernel module for nividia-cards for 2.6.16 or
every time you upgrade
kernel.I have also upgraded to 2.6.16.xx & it works. Pl see me ealier
posting how to rebuild nividia module.

RHEL's up2date has a configuration setting for this:

pkgsToInstallNotUpdate[comment]=A list of provides names or package
names of packages to install not update
pkgsToInstallNotUpdate=kernel;kernel-modules;

So, running "up2date kernel" will install the new version, not upgrade
it. The old version remains installed.

Hi Shakthi,
When i try "CTRL + ALT + F1" it doesn't get into the console. It hangs 
there and the only option i have is to restart.

Test 2: How to do that ?!
( Also, I took the dmesg of current 2.6.14 kernel , how to do the same 
with 2.6.16 as i am not able to get atleast the console?)

append 3 to kernel options in the boot loader screen... should usually
not go to X but give you a login prompt... also, do see your syslog...
hopefully much of what went wrong (including your dmesg output) in
your previous session in 2.6.16 should be there...

You can boot into single user mode by passing the word
"single" to the kernel line in grub configuration. 

You can change the run-level in /etc/inittab in the
line:

 id:3:initdefault:

Even after booting into run-level 3, if you don't see
the console, you need to check the getty lines in the
same /etc/inittab:

 1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1

Even if this doesn't work for you with the new kernel,
then I think its crashed with an OOPS message or stuck
in a deadlock.

Regards,

SK

You mean /dev/tty* ? In recent distros, with HAL,
udevd, if your hardware is present, and detected,
these daemons should create the device files for you.

crw-rw----  1 root dialout 4,  64 2006-04-02 17:24
/dev/ttyS0
crw-rw----  1 root dialout 4,  65 2006-04-02 17:24
/dev/ttyS1

Or use the mknod command to create the device files as
root:

 mknod /dev/ttyS0 c 4 64

> linux and to make it work.

What are you trying to accomplish? What is your
hardware?

This is what I tried just now,

Rebooted and in GRUB screen, selected the commond line "c" option. And..

GRUB> kernel /vmlinux-2.6.16.xx root=LABEL=/1
GRUB>initrd /initrd-2.6.16.xx.img
 The two booted up and then..
GRUB>boot

Then, it  started booting up... within a few seconds.. it hanged out 
with the last thing saying "Kenrel Panic!". I could see some attempts to 
mount and some failures. It just hanged there. Where did I go wrong and 
Where did it go wrong ?

I din't know how to append tht GRUB arguments in the options it gives in 
the grub menu, by pressing "e" instead of C.. ie where to append tht "3" 
which ramkumar said. Doing google, showed me this process of booting up 
with GRUB manually :|

Taking the guidelines from it for adding the NVIDIA driver to my current 
FC4 with kernel-2.6.14 ( I donno how can I do it with my 
not-up-and-running 2.6.16), I have a few doubts and queries..

1.

    yum install rpm-build
    yum install kernel-devel -y
    yum update kernel kernel-devel -y

I have already installed the new kernel (thru yum extender, a GUI for YUM). So i need not do i t again :) ??

2. 

reboot
select the new kernel, then:
  

U mean reboot into the new 2.6.16 which is not up-n-running yet or my 
current 2.6.14 ??

3.

wget http://people.redhat.com/davej/kernels/Fedora/FC5/kernels.repo
wget http://www.leemhuis.info/files/fedorarpms/MISC.lvn/graphics/xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-1.0.8178-0.lvn.5.i386.rpm
wget http://www.leemhuis.info/files/fedorarpms/MISC.lvn/graphics/nvidia-kmod-1.0.8178-0.lvn.3.2.6.15_1.1881_FC5.src.rpm

  

In these 3 lines, FC5 is used... what if i am doing this in FC4. will it 
be ok to just replace that 5 as 4 ??

4.

cd /root/nvidia
rpmbuild --rebuild --target `uname -m` nvidia-kmod-*.src.rpm
cp -a /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/`uname -m`/kmod-nvidia* ./
  

When i am not able to be even in command line of my 2.6.16, will doing 
this help me ??

Sorry, If i was wrong anewhere... am still at the middle part of the 
learning curve :(

Yes They do retain the old kernel.. Atleast Ubuntu 5.10 does it and did it 
for me when upgrading sometime back. Now I have compiled 2.6.16 manually and 
is running good. Except for some minor errors. Will rectify it. :)

I think you will have to do a custom build of the kernel with support for 
NVIDIA Graphix card. My kernel config file says that NVIDIA related Drivers 
are excluded ! might be the reason.. Or even what I am talking might not 
make sense.. Jus try to rebuild by including all NVIDIA related drivers.

It doesn't mount your partitions properly? Can you
post the exact error messages prior to the panic?
Either no support for you filesystem on your hard
disk, or no proper drivers for IDE/SATA or any other.

He meant the "kernel" line. If you add "single" to the
kernel line, it will boot into run-level 1.

Your running kernel is a binary image in /boot. What
you are compiling is source code, against the kernel
sources present in your hard disk.

Recompile the driver against the kernel sources.

After you have patched the driver, compiled with the
kernel sources, to test the new kernel, you need to
reboot with it.

Boot into the running 2.6.14 or any other kernel, then
compile your 2.6.16 kernel, and reboot with the newly
compiled kernel.

Can you list the options given? Probably copy it down

What is your partitioning scheme?

     Either no support for you filesystem on your hard

   How did i get the error msg ? any log files ? i did take a dmesg output
   from my current kernel 2.6.14 after the kernel panic occured with 2.6.16.
   What does dmesg actually tell  about and how does it get appended, ie,
   will it get appended with new messages at every reboot ? Is it common for
   any number of kernels you can run for a single distro ?

  

 He meant the "kernel" line. If you add "single" to the
 kernel line, it will boot into run-level 1.
  

   Can you give me an example ? I am not understanding it quite right, where
   to append as there are 3 lines in it  :(

Not for 2.6.14, the last kernel messages for 2.6.16
that had the kernel panic. You can write it down.

syslogd, klogd writes them to /var/log/messages for
the successful boots, not for the paniced kernel.

Sure. At any instant, only one kernel runs.

When grub loads, press 'e' to edit, move to the kernel
line using arrow keys, and press 'e' to edit the line.
Move to the end of the line and type "single". Now
press 'b' to boot. It should boot into single user
mode.

We'll have a discussion on kernel compilation during
our next meet.

Have fun,

SK

Sure. It has instructions on how to compile a driver
for 2.6 kernels.

For 2.6 kernel compilation, I just use:

 make clean
 make menuconfig
 make
 make modules_install
 make install

Check this too:

Also google for Linux kernel compilation documents.

Till FC4, Fedora doesnt remove older kernels at all by default. FC5 has
a yum plugin enabled by default that retains the current+ last two
kernels. Configurable in /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/installonlyn.conf.

Message-ID: <5580629a0604021801p1e4cef73h5bc55a490030c38b@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks a lot for your excellent advice a few weeks ago for my query
(Choosing a broadband connection)
        I chose Airtel 500+ (256 kbps) with unlimited niightime and a
rental modem . It turned out that my computer did not have something
called ethernet card. So the airtel guys gave me a usb connection to
my computer through the same modem ( Beetel 220BX. They told me that I
could work on windows with the USB style modem, but for linux I needed
the Ethernet card( or lan card) (dunno what their words confused me a
bit.). I am still searching for a distro I like, I think gento 2006.0
will do the trick, but in any case I want an ethernet ( or lan
whichever is right) card that is supported by most( better if it is
all ) distros. Can anybody suggest one.
Thanks in advance ,
Ashok.

ethernet and lan card are the same thing. AFAIK all lan cards 
automatically work with all distros. Realtek is ok.

Ethernet, technically - LAN could include things like wireless and token 
ring... Not that it matters anymore, since most wired LAN is ethernet and 
most wireless is 802.11.

Almost any ethernet card is supported, but I've found one or two cards that 
just refuse to work. For example, the Zebronics card with a Realtek chipset 
seems to have enough modifications to make it stop working with the drivers 
on the kernel. There are one or two other cards like that, which refuse to 
work, but generally, most cards with an RTL8139 chipset should work. Also, 
anything with a Winbond or an NE2000 type chipset.

You can also use a USB modem, if it's a Globespan chipset (some other chipsets 
also, but Globespan is what I've used), but I recommend that you don't go 
that way.

Gentoo is an excellent distro to use (well, I use it! :-) ), but it's also got 
a really crazy learning curve. If you're prepared to stick it out when it 
gets difficult, Gentoo is fine. But if you need something that Just Works, 
I'd suggest that you start with Ubuntu and change the repositories to Debian.

I 'suspect' the attempt at removal was aimed at me because it shortly
followed the private threatening mail to me. Maybe I'm just paranoid!!  I
feel Prof Sriram handled it appropriately. Lets leave that matter at that.

AFAIK, in the past 6 Years, Person is thrown away from the list, only
for the following reasons. Not for anything else.

1. Mailbox is in Full State and mails are continuously bounce 
   back to server.
2. Spam the mailing list.

Can we put up any ILUGC banners/posters inside IIT-M,
atleast outside the TeNeT office? 

There are lots and lots of newcomers to the mailing
list and ILUGC. It would help them find their way
through, easily.

I'm not sure I would recommend changing repositories to Debian. Ubuntu, 
though it relies on Debian's packaging system, has a different set of 
packages and things like Firefox version are pretty locked down (for 
example - if you try to uninstall firefox, gnome-volume-manager and its 
friends will also disappear).

This is because Ubuntu releases are very well tested, and the won't 
change until the next release (except for bug fix updates). I'm guessing 
Bad Things Happen(TM) when you mix up both repositories (and God forbid, 
you set it to unstable).

Use something like Automatix if you want the latest stuff that's missing 
in Breezy.


Vamsee.

I have been watching this conversation on tech and non tech for quite some
time.
Would like to add my views on a few basic points.

Most of the users of all tech products are non tech people.
So, a hi tech product which was not presented properly to the actual end
users
will ultimately become use(r)less in spite of all its technical marvels.

On the other hand, if all the end users want a new tech product, they will
encourage and support the development of the technology and  the product
will some how be made available. Because Need is the MOTHER of all
inventions.

Numerous example can be found for this. In short relevance
Micro$oft's growth is in covering the first point well.
and Linux's growth is in serving  the second point well.

It will be Great if Linux addresses the first point also.

ex: Becoming more and more user friendly . ( for the non tech user of
course)

U and me may be comfortable even with the cli. But we must understand that
than the technical superiority of Linux unfriendlyness is actually what
attracts the non tech user. Without the non tech end user's support, any
product is use(r)less.

The point : It is the non-tech that determines the success of the tech.

Then about the coup in b-lug and related discussions :
Not to worry too much about this.
They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety
deserve neither liberty nor safety.  -Benjamin Franklin

Subject: [Ilugc] Block device driver, non-Interrupt drivem
Message-ID: <4430EDC5.4030701@gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am working for a  block device driver. The existing code is an 
interrupt-driven block  driver and  now wanted to make it as  a 
non-interrupt driven driver.

I have commented the "request_irq" function and the "interrupt enabling 
function"  in the driver  while initializing the module and it gets 
loaded well. When i try to read a sector , the control doesn't come to 
the user back though it reads the sector data and prints it correctly.

Do anyone have a sample code for non-interrupt  driven block driver or a 
pointer in the net.  I am in doubt wether the spinlocks  are causing  a  
deadlock, but not sure.

Thanks in advance.
Sudheer

I could run 2.6.16 kernel in Single user mode. Logged in as user and 
tries to start X with a su. It tried to star X and as it occured during 
normal start, only a blank screen was the end. Then i came back to CLI, 
and saved dmesg and /var/log/messages. Think, the problem is with X. 
Will try installing the Nvidia driver as per vasudevan's advice as I 
have access to CLI under 2.6.16 now. Hope, it solves the problem. Will i 
need some other log/error messages other than the two i took. 
/var/log/messages din't have anything under .2.6.16 kernel. So, i will 
add up my dmesg output at the end of this mail. Hope, it doesn't trouble 
others my filling up their inboxes with a relatively bigger mail.. sorry 
if so :(

That will be gr8. I will try to get permission this saturday and come

Yes, mostly the driver with the X configuration, since
your X already works with the previous kernels.

So, you now know how to debug :)

Try to bring your colleagues, managers as well :)

Which distro are you using? Can you first test if your
corresponding distro pre-compiled backstreet ruby
binary kernel images boot on your system?

http://karlovo.demon.co.uk/~svetlio/ruby-contrib/how-to/XFree_local_multi-user-HOWTO/inst_kernel.html

Looks to me like a similar issue:

The testing time still prevades...

As i was resolved to make my kernel 2.6.16 up and running in X, i tried 
out the following 3 things, one after another. But all in vain!

1. Following Vasudevan's advice of installing the nvidia driver, which 
he had proposed for FC5, i tried the procedure he had proposed in his 
earlier mail. But unfortunately wget failed, as the site owner has moved 
the nvidia-driver rpms out of his collection. I checked it manually in 
browser where he doesnt have the rpms for nvidia-driver and he had 
indeed specified that he has moved them off. He had given a link which 
openned new doors.

2. The leading link suggested me to use "Yum Install" to get the 
drivers. Unfortunately all the repos i had specified in my yumm failed 
with the driver.

3. Googling for "Installing nvidia-driver in FC4" took me to few good 
sites where the ncidia driver isntallation were neatly given.

I manually downloaded the file from the website ( ) which is " 
NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8178-pkg1.run"

They had suggested to run this file with a -aqn option for buiding the 
nvidia driver module into the kernel modules.

I logged in as single user into 2.6.16 and tried the following,

$ su
# cd /root/nvidia
# ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8178-pkg1.run -aqn

This started the kernel build screen, it started building the kernel but 
failed saying that it couldnot build the proposed ncidia-driver modules. 
I now have the nvidia-installer log which tells what happenned during 
the driver installation/module build process.

I hereby put the nvidia-install log. Can anyone help me in figuring out 
what went wrong and why the driver module didn't build up ?!

5: error: ?struct task_struct? has no member named
?rlim?

Says it all. 

rlim is of type struct rlimit, declared in struct
signal_struct in include/linux/sched.h in 2.6 kernels,
not in struct task_struct.

http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/linux/sched.h#L331

Only in 2.4 kernels, struct rlimit was embedded in
struct task_struct:

http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/linux/sched.h?v=2.4.20#L382

Report it to the nvidia developers.

Hi Parthan,

Try the steps given in this Link

http://www.sourcemage.org/node/1546

(or)

http://forums.suselinuxsupport.de/index.php?showtopic=32121

Think the above is for 64 bit! But the former should work out.

Greetings!

Frederick Noronha has made a nice poster to promote
ILUG-Goa. It can be viewed from here:

http://f3.grp.yahoofs.com/v1/MOExRGzWjBwcq3e1WEGNtHHcil4gtI_YdIxmBHVqj_fqftpC0ey2NBSmInOSkcq2ZteT_mp9AyErSRMBt6zn/ilugposterbig.pdf

Its a very nice idea, actually. Students can download
it and put it in their school/college bulletin boards.
Even employees can put it up in the company bulletin
boards. Its a very good way to create awareness. 

It can be done in LaTeX or OpenOffice.

Think we should make one for ILUGC? 

Suggestions are welcome.

If you're running KDE, Krdc works quite well - works on top of VNC and/or some 
other things.

That is E17 (Enlightenment DR17 release), and AFAIK, thats the best
eyecandy (and quite performant) desktop for GNU/Linux.

I'm using it at home with GNU/Linux and at office with FreeBSD 4.x.

Enlightenment would be the best choice.
Check out : http://www.elivecd.org/
There is an install to HDD option available in elive. But SATA is not
supported.
Nvidia cards are supported to quite an extent - I have tried it with a 6800
GS card and it worked fine.

yes it is E17 with the Milky theme... Eclair is a music player written
with the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) (E17 is written on
top of these libraries as well)

it moves on...

hi all
i installed fc5 a few days ago.. and i'm having a tough time setting up the
logitech quick cam..
i tried installing this driver called qc-usb(http://qce-ga.sourceforge.net/)
on 2.6.15 as well as 2.6.16  kernels, but failed..
Quite specifically, the qc-usb detects the webcam correctly , but soon after
compilation of the driver, it gives the following error ( and more) :
" ./quickcam.sh: line 699: [: too many arguments " ..
.. i had no problems in installing the same driver in fc4.. can u help me
out?

It is the most eye candy desktop I have seen so far. But usability is less.
i.e integration with other tools. I have managed to integrate with nautilus.
But still it lacks.

Its Xfce. Xfce is good interms of Graphics. It does not occupy much memory.
If you try Xfce as default as in FedoraCore and RedHat systems, you wont be
experiencing the look and feel of Xfce. You may need to change the User
Interface Settigns in those. But take the latest version, install them (Xfce
comes with a very good graphical installer!) and experience the best out of
it.

I am using Xfce for some time,i see the KDE and Gnome apps loading faster. I
wonder how is that happening as we can see if we try to openn KDE apps in
Gnome, it takes little time to come up.

There is another way (simple, I hope):

1. When coming from the IIT-M main gate, come to
Gajendra Circle.

2. Take a LEFT at Gajendra Circle and proceed further.
You'll pass Central Lecture Theater (on the right),
but, keep going straight. 

3. Take the first RIGHT.

4. Keep going straight and take the second RIGHT. You
will have the "Center for Intelligent Optical
Networking" building on the right. 

5. Come to the 3rd floor, room CSD #320 :)

There is also another way. Just ask for CSB (Computer Science Block) . Once
you reach CSB , you can find CSD to be few meters before CSB. I think it
will be approximately 3 kms from the iit entrance gate.

I mean the applications are not well coupled to each other as in GNOME. I
can understand that it is still in developmental stage. Only a limited
applications are coming with this desktop that too not much featured. But
definitely we can expect a lot from this desktop.

Quite interestingly this desktop uses binary configuration file for better
performance.

Message-ID: <20060404120629.GA5531@localhost>

Hello! I thought people might find this tip useful. Often, we find
that we have many files with spaces in the filenames (moreso when they
are got from a Windoze user). Now, I find it very difficult to use
those files keeping the spaces in the names intact. So, I use
something like the following one liner to convert all spaces to `_'
(underscore) in the file names

for i in *jpg; do mv "$i" "`echo "$i"|sed 's/ /_/g'`"; done

Similar solutions with better error checking can be written. You can
also code this in Perl, Python or even AWK. But, this works...

Hope you found this useful.

Hi all,

I want to change the line,

GraphicalTheme=Bluecurve

in gdm.conf to GraphicalTheme=<my-theme> using sed. How to achieve this?.

I tried, sed -e 's/GraphicalTheme=/GraphicalTheme=<my-theme>/ gdm.conf', but
the line does not change here.Only the pattern changes.

Thanks in advance.

this is perhaps more efficient... not posix compliant though (works on
zsh, bash)

for i in *.jpg; do mv "$i" "${i// /-}"; done

or in true zsh style:

for i (*.jpg) mv "$i" "${i// /-}"

or the rename on a debian box (i used to encounter a diff. rename when
i was on fedora, this is the perl based one)

rename 'y/ /-/' *.jpg

The newer versions of sed (at least GNU sed) has the "change in place
feature" which is supported using the -i option.

Or, you can use:

shell> ed gdm.conf <<!
1,$s/Graphical Theme=Bluecurve/Graphical Theme=<my-theme>/g
w
q
!

HTH.


PS.
Read ed(1), sed(1).

sed -e 's/\s*GraphicalTheme\s*=.*/GraphicalTheme=foobar/' gdm.conf

the operational part of the change is the .* at the end. those \s* may
be necessary for parsing any legal gdm.conf in particular.

i find that in order to do anything non-trivial with the gui tools 
you have to know enough to do it without the tool. And if you know 
enough for that, you dont need the tool. The only thing i have ever 
succeeded in doing properly with webmin is to manage users and 
groups and to add/edit/delete cron jobs

Or, just use rename:
rename <from> <to> <files>

For example,
rename " " "" *.jpg

also have a look at /etc/sysconfig/init if you want to play with

Thanks a lot!, it worked. But where did you manage to get these commands of
sed?...am googling but am not able to get a gud tutorial of sed commands....

Now am stuck up with another command...

I want to enable xdcmp flag Enable to true in gdm.conf. What i do, i get all
lines between the words "[xdmcp]" and "HonorIndirect=", and try to replace
that Enable line to Enable=true in those lines. I managed to get help from
http://sed.sourceforge.net/sedfaq4.html#s4.20 as how to get all line between
the words "from" to "until" and replace. But unfortunately it seems to be
not working...no idea why...here is the command,

sed -e '/[xdmcp]/,/HonorIndirect=/ { s/\<\Enable=\>/Enable=false/g }'
/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf

any idea how to make it work?

Thanks in advance.

Are you giving the proper root password? su is meant

hi
I'm Using kernel 2.6.16-1.2084_FC5
the driver is automatically compiled when by the script quickcam.sh(they
recommend doing this than using make )

and more specific error outputs follow:

...

The driver detected the following supported cameras:

./quickcam.sh: line 699: [: too many arguments
ls: : No such file or directory
ls: : No such file or directory
[!]  major number is .
Usually it should be 81, so there are problems ahead.

> .....

[!] qcset did not found the QuickCam camera

however, there are no compilation errors from  make ..

I have got some idea now. I get the line number of the [xdmcp] in the
gdm.conf using the commands,

grep -n -F "[xdmcp]" /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf | awk -F: '{print $1}'

i get 177

So now, if i do a sed like this,

sed -e '177,190 s/Enable=.*/Enable=true/;' /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf > gdm.new

It works perfect !. Now am not able to pass this 177 to sed as a variable. I
tried all kinds of tips and tricks as given here
http://sed.sourceforge.net/sedfaq4.html#s4.23 , but am not able to arrive at
the proper result.

Have anybody tried passing variables as commands to sed?

Thanks in advance.

It worked at last !. The command is,

 export B=`grep -n -F "[xdmcp]" /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf | awk -F: '{print
$1}'` | sed -e ''"$B"',190 s/Enable=.*/Enable=true/;' /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf
> gdm.new

It was a bit tricky here from my previous ways of putting the value into the
variable.

Maybe you would like to try corkscrew[1]. It tunnels the SSH over a
HTTP/HTTPS proxy. After downloading/installing corkscrew binary and
having it in your path, you can use the ProxyCommand in ssh (with -o
switch) as follows.

ProxyCommand corkscrew <your-proxy> <your-proxy-port> %h %p

Note that corkscrew can be used to tunnel any TCP traffic over
HTTP/HTTPS proxy and it works like a charm.

HTH.

Check out the saveconfig script from Knoppix.

http://www.oreillynet.com/sysadmin/blog/2004/11/remaster_knoppix_without_remas.html

You can save the configuration to USB thumb drive or
hard disk, and restore it when you use the LiveCD
again.

When you did "make all" inside qc-usb-x.x, did it
create the quickcam.ko file?

You did insmod the driver? If yes, open a terminal and
post output of:

 /sbin/lsmod | grep quickcam

Hi Friends,

any reason why you did this? - not much point using dedian if you 
are going to install from source

Wow - that looks ugly and fragile :) Have you considered using perl?
There are several modules on CPAN that parses config files of this
type (several [sections] with name=value settings).

What distro are you using? Most of the distributions that package PHP
will have php-imap also included. If you are using debian., check for
php4-imap

It is a bit long, but if you just see as separate without the | , you will
find it easy.

I dont know perl and since it would take time to practice, i thought let me
go with the bash way.

I agree perl might be better. 

The LTSP configuration tool-written in perl- does this i.e enabling
xdmcp in gdm,kdm and xdm. Loot at ltspadmin tool in ltsp.org

well... help was there on your comp... `info sed`! anyway, that was
more of a mistake in the regular expression rather than sed commands..
the s command just matches each line with the regexp given and
replaces it as you say. your earlier pattern just matched till the =
.. as a matter of fact, the only thing i use sed for is the s command,
anything more complex and i go for perl :)

>  It works perfect !. Now am not able to pass this 177 to sed as a variable.

start=`grep -n -F "[xdmcp]" /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf | awk -F: '{print $1}' `
[ x$start != x ] && sed -e "$start,190 s/Enable=.*/Enable=true/;"
/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf > gdm.new

i dunno if u can do this with a single sed script... even if not, i
guess using perl to loop over and finish it off with a single script
would be better and less error prone. (as a matter of fact, you can
write a pretty good ini/conf type file parser (gdm config etc.) in
shell script. i wrote one in zsh for finding out the current firefox
profile using ~/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini, so that i could use the
history file for url completion. could post it here if u want)

it moves on...

scp has nothing to do with your kernel upgrade.

I guess yum update has updated your scp and /etc
configuration files.

I use:

 scp -r directory/ user@host:/path/to/directory

For example:

 scp -r foo/ david@192.168.0.1:/home/david

You can add an entry for 192.168.0.1 in /etc/hosts to
use a name instead of an IP address.

Can you check if ssh into the target system works?

update your fedora installation - you'll find a much more recent set of 
drivers for a bunch of stuff if you move to fc5

though, a cisco aironet or something similar should work just fine on 
fc3 as well

Hi Srinivas,

I didn't ask you to test this. For this to work, you
should be running sshd in your host system.

I thought you were trying to copy from host system to
remote system.

> scp -r root@10.94.4.81:~/aaa/project/serializer
> ~/aaa/project/

-r should be followed by the local directory that you
want to transfer to the remote system. Please check my
syntax example.

hi everybody,
i am using RHEL-4 server and workstations.i am having
a LAN setup connected by Switch.recently we bought a
BSNL data one connection.(its not a permanent IP).
they give  Huawei SmartAX MT800 ADSL router and asked
us to put a IP in the range of 192.168.1.1.
i want to provide a secure Internet access for my LAN
users,
i have a plan to make my linux box as a router (by
using 2 ethernet cards)if i made this setup,should i
implement NAT again? because i think the BSNL peoples
already NATed the IP by their Router.
then if i made a linux router should i change the IP
address range for my LAN clients? (because i am using
DNS and mail servers internally)

i dont know how to setup.please guide me.

192.168.1.1 is not a range. 

It should be mentioned as any host in the
192.168.1.0/24 network.

Secure the router, perhaps?

Thanks for the link. I had visited the link before. Squid allows us to have
a time frame , say, from morning 7.00 am to 12.00 pm or from evening 8.00 pm
to 11.00 pm. But we cannot allow the Squid to allow the user to browse 1
hr/day.This link clearly explains why,
http://www.mail-archive.com/squid-users@squid-cache.org/msg34204.html

So am finally put down to write my own program which handles this.

Message-ID: <BAY110-F93E1500A5182DFE3EDFB19BCB0@phx.gbl>


Hello All,

A small article on Mr. Ankit Fadia. Written by Mr. Prabhat.
FYI


"++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"

Dear All,

Yesterday (03-04-2006)I attended a seminar by a so-called "Hacking Guru"
Ankit Fadia, at DAVV, Indore (MP) auditorium. I just want to share my
feelings with you.

The Seminar was a complete failure, though it was attended by about well
over 100 people, but was a complete disaster.

The very first thing by which I was offended badly was using the sacred word
"Hacking" to demonstrate something we, the hackers, call cracking. The
seminar topic was "Ethical Hacking", now I want to ask Mr Fadia, what is
unethical about hacking ? Hacking is very positive word and there in no need
to put "Ethical" before it. By the way his seminar topic should be "Ethical
Cracking".

If you really want to become a hacker, please read an article by a real
hacker, Eric Steven Raymond (ESR). The man who changed the history by
writing a paper "Cathedral and Bazaar". please read the article here :
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html<http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/faqs/hacker-howto.html>

The people who can not differentiate between hacking and cracking, should
read an article by the GOD of hackers Richad M Stallman (RMS), the man who
started GNU movement all by himself. The gcc (compiler), gdb (debugger),
emacs (editor) are some of the most popular softwares in the world written
by him. Please read the article here :
http://www.outpost9.com/reference/jargon/jargon_69.html

The things Fadia demonstrated were ancient techniques used by crackers to
break into some one's machine. Now a days even 10 year olds can download
these tools from Internet to control others'  machines. Can we call them
hackers ??  If he calls it hacking, I doubt if he understands the term even
"Cracking", leave hacking altogether. This childish behavior is called
script kiddie.

IP spoofing, SQL Injection, password cracking softwares, Trojan horse
programs, these are the tools of cyber criminals. So I wonder what is the
significance of the term "Ethical" here ??

In the entire session I kept waiting for some program or utility, written by
himself. But I don't thing he had something like this to share with
audience. The entire session was demonstration of third party utilities, and
the saddest thing was no  mention of the name of any author of any utility.
He didn't care to give some credits to the utility developers. What a shame
!!!

Mr Fadia, I real hacker always respect the creativity of others, and before
using their work proper credits are given, this is the hacker's attitude.
It's not like that, you download something from Internet, use it and forget
the person, who made it. That's pretty mean.

Second most annoying thing was that he calls himself a "hacker" and was
using a Windows XP operating system ????

I have been in to computers for the past 10 years and I never come across
any real hacker who uses Windows. I met Brian(Apache creator), Andy Cleen,
Alon cox, Rusty (all networking gods), RMS (the GOD himself) but all of them
were using some or other form of Unix or Linux.

Come on, MR Fadia, Windows is the worst OS in the world, full of security
holes, so what is the point to break into a  Windows machine ???? What do
you want to prove ????

He only once mentioned Linux, just to tell how you can use it's live CD to
boot a Windows machine and cracke the password.

Actually, before attending the seminar, I Googled a lot about Fadia and his
work. But what I could find was self acclaiming statement by Fadia about
himself and his future and just crap, crap and crap by technology illiterate
Indian news papers' reports.

I just want to share my findings with you.

Vulnerabilities patches by Fadia          =     0 (He may know how to break
in, but doesn't know how to fix up)
Bugtraq id's by Fadia                          =     0
Hacking / Security tool by fadia           =     0 (He simply Goolge and
download the tools from Internet, that's not cracking. Actual cracker
                                                                   is the
programmer, but Fadia never ever gives due credits. Now that's not hacking,
that's
                                                                   stealing)
Any open source software by Fadia     =    0 (He is afraid of suggesting
Linux to people, 'coz it's secure)
Any Linux or Windows software security patch   =     0
Any recommendation or recognition by Real Hacker Community   =     0 (They
laugh at him. He is just a kid)
Software / Cryptography patents by Fadia        =     0
Algorithms by Fadia                                       =     0
Any official citation by FBI/CIA/CBI for Fadia   =     0 (They don't even
bother about any explanation)
Any confirmation of his self-claims                  =     0 (Nobody, expect
him knows, if they are real)
Any confirmation of him decrypting Osama's message        =     0
(Hahahahahahahaha)
Any original technical tutorial or book by Fadia   =    0 (He simply copy
the things and never he never ever gives due credits to the

original authors.)
Any originality in his tutes or books             =     0 (Hahahahahahaha)
Skill level of Fadia                                     =     Only God
knows !!!


I tried to read a few books by him, but to my wonder some part of his books
are nothing but simple "copy and paste" material from well known sites for
Windows registry editing. Please visit www.winguides.com and compare the
material with his first book. Oh God !  this is the clear violation of
intellectual property rights of the website. Please inform the webmaster. I
have done it already.

I was astonished by the course he came to promote here, "Ethical hacker
certified by Ankit Fadia" ! He sill is child in hacking field, and he is
giving the certificates for hacking ?????  And worst thing, Reliance web
world is promoting it. What a shame !!!  Have all gone mad ? Can't they see
?

Unfortunately, question and answer round was cut from the seminar, that's
also because of Fadia arrived there one hour late. Well, that's India's
celebrity style statement. Otherwise, I would have asked all these questions
to him there only.

Anyways, I went to him at the end of the seminar, and asked if Windows is so
vulnerable, can he suggest audience to use Linux rather than Windows. And
the reply came was straight "NO". What a shame ???

I understood the reason, why he said no. The reason is same why Microsoft
does not patch up it's OS. Plain economics. If you make system secure with
Linux who is going to ask for people like Fadia, so called "security expert"
???

I want to make an appeal to all of you, please make all of your friends
aware of these facts. Let one should not get undeserved advantage. I also
want to appeal news papers, please do not make a hero out of nothing. Stop
polluting the honest media by prejudiced reports.

And at the end I want to tell Mr Fadia, that I don't have any personal
problem with you or your achievements, but please behave properly in hacking
community. We hackers are very positive people we never ever try to harm
anybody, until he comes to our or our philosophy's way. Please stop calling
your self a hacker, if does not understand the hacker culture.

And for god sake, stop behaving like a child, now you are in college, so
GROW UP !!!

I belive he was consulted by the CIA regarding breaking some encrypted
messages. He has also been personally appreciated by APJ Abdul Kalam
(someone i hold in great respect).

Yes, He has used the term hacking in its misconceptualised meaning, Its
sad but then i think the article was rather grossly unfair to him!

Hi,
I installed a new kernel 2.6.15 with ck patches and everything is working
fine until i noticed that
whenever i insert my usb drive or my external cdwriter,
its not automounted by HAL,
its getting displayed in my "My computer" but when I click it, its giving a
error message, unable to mount,
Generally it happens that , whenever a enw device is connected, it shows a
link on my desktop,
now i have to read the dmesg and mount it my self..

Can anyone tell me why its not working?
Does changing the kernel have any effect? what can i do to rectify?

Regards

I had bought his first book and wished I hadn't done it. All the
information in that book can be found easily on the internet. I learnt
that you don't need any books to learn hacking(whatever meaning you
take). It has got to be within yourself.

No he hasn't been. I haven't heard of the APJ bit before, but I expect
that too because of the media hype he has got. He doesn't have any
credibility in the infosec industry/community, anyway - the only
people who'd listen to him are a bunch of suckers in a hero-starved
nation like ours.

I had attended his seminar in Jaipur too, and can confirm that it was
nothing short of disaster. It was like a magic show to many, and he had
nothing more to show than a bunch of child's tricks.

It won't take long for anyone to claim that they worked for "an
international secret intelligence agency", that fact is unverifiable.

Writing an external authenticator for Squid is very easy.  If you program
in a high level language (insert your favourite language starting with P)
the whole project could just be an evening's hack.

I'm unable to point you to the right docs, sorry.  If you have problems,
please post.

However, I'm unable to understand what 1 hr browsing means...

Is it 1hr counting from first successful proxy access of the day?

To be more clear, i will allow my client to browse internet only 1 hour/day.
Not more than one hour. He may utilize the 1 hour on any slot , not
specifically 8-9 or 10-111. For some users, we will allow 2 hours and for
rest unlimited browsing. So , as we are using Squid as our proxy server, i
thought why dont we use Squid to serve this purpose.

I would be very happy if you could help me out in getting any external apps
or how to proceed in writing an application on this.

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0604060008060.9853@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,
I have installed Fedora 5 in dell inspiron 6000 laptop. Everything except
wireless internet connection is working fine.

On searching through the google, I found the link
"http://fedoranews.org/cms/node/478" and followed the procedures. But it
is not connecting. The wireless router is netgear and the laptop is the
standard one(I have not added/modified any hardware).

The wireless works fine with windows-XP. Some how i want to use linux
totally(moving out of windows). But for internet i am forced to use
ms-windows as of now.
If anyone could give me a pointer of how to configure wireless, it would
be very helpful.

NOTE:
When connecting with cable, with Fedora 5, I am able to connect to the
internet. And
FOr wireless, with the tries which I made, the Fedora 5 is identifying my
wireless network, BUT not connecting to it.

Thanks and Regards,

You should first try to connect without wireless
encryption. You can later play with encryption.

Open a terminal, and post output of:

 /sbin/ifconfig -a
 /sbin/iwconfig -a
 /sbin/lsmod
 cat /etc/resolv.conf
 /sbin/route -n

Note, you can redirect output to a file:

 /sbin/lsmod > lsmod.txt

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0604060037150.28472@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,
I wanted to install linux in dell inspiron 6000 laptop which is already
housing Win-XP. I dont want to reformat OR lose the data and create an
extra partition. I wanted this without affecting the current single
partion(C: which is 60GB).

The earlier posting by Mr.M.Balakrishna Pillai with the link
"(http://www.systemrescuecd.org/)" helped perfectly in that. Thanks for
that.

Now, with the current 10 GB reserved for Linux, I tried few
distros(ubuntu, suse, gentoo, fedora 5). I dont know exactly which is better.
One is better in one way. For example, wireless was detected perfectly by ubuntu.
Fedora i found rich set of programming environment but seemed too bulky
and did not work well with the wireless.

My requirement is simple. I want to lay my hands at different programming
languages and programming environments as a developer. Cant say exactly i
will be mostly working with shell, or perl or python, or c or java etc.
I may require one or other at different occasions. I dont want too much of
games or other features like too many GUIS like. Just one is enough.
Though I could select various of this during installtion, I am not sure
which is the best for programmer/developer(I believe I know better than
a newbie linux user).

"**But I also need wireless to be working properly.** "

If any body of you could suggest a stable distro for a enthusiastic
developer it would be very helpful.

Googling does not help in this regard and I dont want any flame wars.

Just I require expert's suggestions.

Thanks

There are quite a few web sites that allows you to pick a distro based
on your interests.
Nobody can say this distro is the best, it depends on your personal taste.

You can start off with this perhaps -

hai,

      FYI tomcat's default port is 8080. you can try like this
http://192.9.200.62:8080/examples. If you are running any proxy server on
this port, you will have to play arround with catalina files. it should be
there in /usr/local/tomcat/bin/catalina.properties.

(My) Reasons why you would want to recompile a kernel:

1. A missing driver has to be compiled into the kernel.
2. Add source patches for enhanced desktop performance.
3. Trim the kernel by removing unnecessary drivers and modules (use
   with caution!)
4. For the fun of watching your processor fan speed and temperature
   hit the ceiling on GKrellm!

So, you can compile the kernel for fun and learning how to do it; you
will surely come across some other situation where you might need it,
so it is better to learn now...

There are distribution specific as well as generic ways of compiling
your kernel. So, just Google for compile kernel + <distro>. Or, as
mentioned in an earlier post, see the README file in the kernel source
directory.

HTH.

/usr/src/linux is usually a symlink to the actual directory of your
kernel source.

Once you are in the directory of your kernel source, type:

make menuconfig

and you will get a nice interface to configure your kernel. After you're
done, save your changes and then type:

make && make modules_install

to recompile your kernel. The kernel image will then be located in
arch/i386/bzImage; which you may have to copy to your boot drive, and
point grub (or your bootloader) to it. These instructions are valid only
for the 2.6.x kernels.

Hope this helps.

Its always advisable to do a "make mrproper" first before starting to configure.
And doing a "make oldconfig" (u need to zcat /proc/config.gz >.config
before this) will set the default options against your running kernel,
then you can begin with selecting/deselecting with "make menuconfig".

Use xmms to play mp3s. Which distribution are you

software.

MP3 is patented. So Most of Free Software Distros never supply it by 
default. But you can download the plug-ins from the Net and attach 
with that.

Procedure is available in the Real Player site. Just go thru that.

XMMS is good free software player. Just give a try.

Dear Kumar,

I have recompiled the kernel long back to observe the network packets
flow in the kernel. To that end, I have modified the some of the network
kernel modules and build the new kernel. I booted the build kernel and I
got what is want.

Please find the steps to recompile the kernel OR to build a new kernel
Image below. (The first 8 steps are required to build a new kernel
image)

I think you require the steps 9 to 15.

1. Download the required kernel source file i.e *.tar.gz from
www.kernel.org

2. Copy the downloaded file into /usr/src directory and untar the file.

3. Change the permissions of the file using the command:
	# chown -R root:root <directory name>
	where <directory name> is source directory name like
linux-2.6.10.

4. Create the link to the above linux directory
	# ln -s <directory name> linux(link name)

5. make mrproper

6. make clean

7. make menuconfig

8. make prepare-all

	The steps 5-8 required to change the version.h file. If the file
does not exists create it.

Note: No need to change any modifications to Makefile - EXTRAVERSION
symbol. If we add anything it will append in version.h file.

9. make menuconfig - do the modifications.

10. make clean

11. make bzImage - creates the image file under i386
directory.(arch/i836/boot/bzImage)

12. make modules.

If you have stuff being echo'ed from your startup files, scp will
fail. Remove such stuff.

If you really need to echo, then do it within a construct like
(assuming you don't have PS1 customization in your startup scripts):

if [ -n "$PS1" ]; then
   echo whatever
fi

The correct solution is to figure out if the startup file is being
called from a login/interactive shell or not correctly, but doing that
is left as an exercise to the reader.

No, you don't need to. You just need to forward IP packets between
your interfaces.

sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0

(Add an entry in /etc/sysctl.conf for this to be persistent). Also,
have your routing setup correctly.

To be truly using the full functionality of this, you LAN should be on
a different subnet.

Also, you can try to experiment with a bridged setup on your server :)
It needs to be dedicated, though.

You can configure a local yum repository

Yes. Selecting all the different groups. Right clicking on a group will
give you a menu option to install all the optional packages more easily
but I wouldnt recommend installing all the packages given in the media.

Yum localinstall will check the local filesystem to resolve dependencies
or use the repositories to resolve them. If you have downloaded a
package and want to resolve dependencies for it without having to
download it again, you can run localinstall on them. Check the man page
of yum and http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/yum/ for more information on
this.

If it turns out to be the gentoo 2006.0 livecd with gui installer, i can
advice u that u will need really a lot of patience. KDE and oo will take
hours to compile. Also u can install properly only with a running internet
connection, something like a broadband on ethernet card. I tried the
install. But after 6 long hours on a pentium 4 2.8 ghz with 512 mbram, i got
irritated and installed arch linux instead.

We just want to pass on the good gospel of running FLOSS. The choice is yours.

 it is better

Compiles!!!  What do you do with the missing dll hell?  Have you heard
of magic invented by  FLOSS people like  APT, YUM that can  resolve
all dependencies. When I want to install something to my Debian
machine, I just do

apititude install something

A little later phewwwwwwww! I would have something on my machine. The
magic of APT will download all incredients to cook something on my
machine. Actually it comes ready to eat. You can also download it raw,
modify as you wish and cook it on your machine.

Gentoo has a magic called portage. Just do

emerge something

and phewwwwwwwwwww!!!, something would be cooked and ready to run. How
long it takes to cook  depends on how much cook and the power of your
fire. The recipe for cooking something on your machine is built into
portage. It will download all incredients and cook it for you. Yea you
can also download pre-cooked stuffs. Those are called something.bin
food in Gentoo. If you ask me who's the chef behind it, its Daniel
Robbins.

He was off to MS kitchen to try mix MS and Open Source cuisine. He
isn't there anymore though.

  Many resumes with RHCE would show up. I am sorry, not many turn out
to be good. Some made it to the floor. Yea, sorry. Still not good.

Just because the BBC confuses the term doesn't make the misconception
right. Just becuase so many people in Chennai say "today night" ,
"yesterday night",  that doesn't make it correct English. It's 
"tonight", "lastnight".

So dude, should you like to try the magics I said, this is right
place. There many magicians in Ilugc far better the ones you find in
Harry Potter movies.

As for me, I would say  a little better than Harry's friend Ron.

Subject: [Ilugc] read call in block driver
Message-ID: <4436635B.4080101@gmail.com>

Hello all,
I am working with flash, a  block driver.
When i do  a simple read system call for 2 times to get sector  data and 
each time 512 bytes(1 sector),
call: read(fd, ubuf, 512);
... the varaible NumSectors in the block driver for the first read is 2 
and for second read is 0.
The data read to ubuf is also different.

The parameter that is passed as number of bytes from read call  is not 
considered in the driver and 2 sectors are read in the driver.

Can anyone tell me how the NumSectors gets assigned in the driver & how 
it is related to  "CURRENT->current_nr_sectors" .

Thanks
Sudheer

<snip>
A return value greater than or equal to 0, instead, tells the calling
program how many bytes have been successfully transferred. If some data is
transferred correctly and then an error happens, the return value must be
the count of bytes successfully transferred, and the error does not get
reported until the next time the function is called. Implementing this
convention requires, of course, that your driver remember that the error has
occurred so that it can return the error status in the future.

The data read to ubuf is also different.
>

<snip>
 What must be missing in your code for read call,  "there is no data, but it
may arrive later." In this case, the read system call should block. ( My
Guess, as code is not available ;) )


Can anyone tell me how the NumSectors gets assigned in the driver & how
> it is related to  "CURRENT->current_nr_sectors" .

<snip>
If there is no filesystem in the device, you just get the probe
transfers.Some filesystems have their magic number in the first sector, and
some have it later in the device.

To detail it , depends on your code, whether you making filesystem on device
or the other way.

Would be better if you paste the code for any explanation.

Animesh.

Hi Shakthi,
on experimenting with various distros, I found OpenLX to be very good for
my requirements(rich programming environments and numerous useful packages
and things like ntfs mounting features).

I saw the FLOSS pictures of Arunai Engg college and in  that it seems
like you were using OpenLX in the Laptop.

Mine is Dell inspiron 6000. Could you please tell me how to configure
wireless internet connection for this.

I tried /sbin/ifconfig, iwconfig, lsmod stuffs. It is showing b44 but i
believe some more thing has to be installed. I am not pretty sure.
I could not find relevant information for configuring on OpenLX
from web/google. With a belief that OpenLx is based on Fedora, I tried to
do the things mentioned for Fedora for this also. It did not work out.
Correct me if my understanding is not correct.

If you know how to configure, pls let me know or even pointers to the web
links would be helpful.

Thanks and Regards,
carti

Hi,

i am using slackware9.1, kernel 2.4.22.

when i installed the package iproute2.2.4.7...tgz. it
is working fine for ipv4. but for ipv6 it is not
displaying the "realm" value.

the ip command i used to add ipv6 route

ip -6 route add fed0:1:1:3::/64 via fec0:1:1:2::2 realms 100

ip command i used to display the route

ip -6 route show

for normal routing it is working fine for ipv6.

i want the realm support.

i am unable to compile the iproute2 package but i finally compiled in
kernel 2.4.5 using kernel 2.4.7 header files. After this also it is
not showing the realm value for ipv6 but it shown the realm value for
ipv4.

if i know problem it more helpful for me.

Nope. Mine was Debian. Maybe the screenshot was

rpm and yum are available as packages. but it is better to use the
package alien to convert from rpm to deb and install it.

I have installed  e17 . IT rocks . I have a small problem . I have to get

 However I want that to appear as an option in the Start up screen itself ..
Like GNOME and KDE options in the Start UP screen where we enter our root

Plus, since you are on Debian Sarge, I recommend k3b. Install it using

apt-get install k3b

I would not recommend installing any unofficial packages on a debian box.
The package may not follow the debian FHS, and you may have problems
later on.  Read: http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/fhs/.

I would recommend that you extract the rpm package (like a tgz archive)
and manually move the files into /usr/local/<package-name>.

You don't even need rpm to be installed to extract rpm files. rpm files are
infact gzipped cpio archives (preceeded by a small rpm header).  You
should be able to find an "rpm2cpio" script on the web that will help you
unpack an rpm file.

If you're running gnome, you might consider getting Gnome CD Master or
Gnome Baker. I recommend Gnome Baker since it can burn DVDs also nicely.

Linux a BIG hit in India

Leslie D'Monte | April 08, 2006

It has been over a year since UTI Bank set up its call center that
handles over 7,000 calls per day. The bank was looking for a robust
platform that could guarantee it "high availability of services and
uninterrupted call traffic". It had options but finally decided on Linux
for its core business applications.

"Today, we are really happy with Linux that has delivered 99.99 per cent
uptime so far," says Pritesh Thaker, AVP, IT, UTI Bank. The bank, in
fact, is now planning to base its credit card-based system on Linux too.

UTI is not the lone player to swear by Linux. Eveready, a leading
manufacturer of dry cell batteries and flashlights in India, has built a
mission-critical resource system to automate all functionalities of its
daily business using the Oracle e-business suite running on a Linux
platform. Central Bank of India has implemented Linux in nearly 3000
branches.

The Penguin (official mascot of Linux), it appears, has finally marched
into enterprises like IDBI Bank, Canara Bank, New India Assurance, LIC,
BSNL, IRCTC, ABN Amro, Airtel and even the governments of Maharashtra
and West Bengal. The list, of course, is not exhaustive.

In most cases, though, the implementation of Linux in Indian enterprises
is by Red Hat (primarily since Red Hat Linux has been popularised by the
media and offers support for Linux which, being open source, can be
downloaded for free and has no upfront licensing fee).

Otherwise, one can choose from the hundreds of other Linux distributions
- Mandriva, Debian, Suse, PCLinuxOS, Knoppix and Ubuntu to name a few -
for desktops and enterprises.

"All verticals are ready for Linux adoption today. However the banking,
financial and insurance services (BFSI) and government markets have been
pioneers of sorts in adopting Linux. The retail segment is also gaining
ground quickly, along with verticals ranging from telecommunications to
media and entertainment.

"In India, we are increasingly seeing corporates running ERPs and
mission-critical applications on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform.
Large databases and blade servers are being powered by Linux to run
online share trading and lottery applications," says Javed Tapia, CEO,
Red Hat.

The Indiabulls group is a case in point. Indiabulls runs its Internet
trading platform - Oracle 9i  - on Linux. This system, which handles
40-45 per cent of Indiabulls' revenue transactions - nearly 10,000
customers are online at any point of time and transactions are in the
range of Rs 1000 crore (Rs 10 billion) - runs on Linux. The online share
trading infrastructure at Indiabulls generates close to 150000 database
queries per minute.

"Linux has become prettly stable. We never considered Windows because of
the perception that it has a lot of vulnerabilities. Hence, we adopted
the Linux route and are satisfied with the results," says Tejinderpal
Singh Miglani, CTO, Indiabulls.

IDBI's Sanjay Sharma, Head IT, corroborates this view. IDBI has been
using an Oracle HR management and financial accounting system, which
runs on Linux. From Sharma's perspective, this is a "mission-critical"
application. "We did evaluate options like Unix and Windows too.
However, we did not want to be tied up to resource-hungry applications
and any particular vendor. Besides, you hardly have a problem of viruses
with Linux," he says.

Linux, indeed, is doing reasonably good business. IBM's business built
around Linux, for instance, was worth $16 billion last year and is
projected to be worth more than $50 billion, says the company's global
head of public sector Linux sales, Mary Ann Fisher, who recently spoke
at LinuxWorld, Australia.

She added: "Governments worldwide are spending more than $3 billion a
year on Linux hardware, software and services, and this is growing at 35
per cent a year. But it's the US military that is spending the most."

"Mission-critical" debate

Now, mission-critical applications, among other things, need servers.
And for the first time, the server market in India is expected to cross
the 100,000-unit mark in 2006. Servers are powerful networked machines
for tasks such as handling e-mail, financial transactions, airline
reservations and file storage.

Based on the price, vendors classify servers as small (anywhere from Rs
40000 up to Rs 500,000), medium (from Rs 500,000 to Rs 1 crore) and
large (over Rs 1 crore). They are identified as Intel (or X86
processor-based), Unix (or non-X86 processor-based) and Blade servers.
Linux and Solaris are flavours of Unix. Windows and Intel form the
loosely-termed "Wintel" brand.

Back in 2000, India was primarily a Unix market in the enterprise. With
the entry of certified and supported Linux solutions, Unix users in
India found Linux an attractive proposition to migrate to. IDC has
consistently reported Linux as the fastest growing OS in the world and
predicts that the overall market revenue for Linux will exceed $35
billion by 2008.

Globally, Windows narrowly overtook Unix in 2005 to claim the top spot
in server sales for the first time, according to IDC. Computer makers
sold $17.7 billion worth of Windows servers worldwide in 2005 compared
with $17.5 billion in Unix servers. Linux came third. The Unix market,
though, is still huge. Sun is trying to restore Unix fortunes as well by
making Solaris an open-source project and bringing it to the x86
servers.

The battle for Unix customers (traditionally, the server King) is not
new, with IBM, HP and Red Hat all pushing Unix-to-Linux migration plans.
This definitely has hurt Sun's profitability. Sun, in turn, released
Solaris 10 last year as a free download (it has close to 5 million
downloads).

Praveen Sawkar, country manager, Solaris, Sun Microsystems India, admits
that "Linux has gained some traction in the x86 server space and has
managed to break Wintel combination's stronghold on this segment of the
market".

However, he adds, that most mission-critical applications in the world
"continue to be deployed, almost without exception, on the SPARC
platform".

He opines it will be a long time before the industry will start basing
their mission-critical applications on Linux. "In the BFSI industry, one
of the largest users of mission-critical applications, Linux is used for
end-user banking, algorithmic and analytical work (derivative analysis
and risk portfolio assessment). It is yet to be used in core banking
environments, something that can be classified as being
mission-critical," asserts Sawkar.

Microsoft concurs with this view. Sanjiv Mathur, director (customer and
partner experience), Microsoft Corporation India, notes that according
to IDC, 42.3 per cent of mission-critical applications worldwide run on
Windows server platform.

"With a 69.5 per cent market share, Microsoft has a strong foothold
across all verticals including BFSI and government. Linux has a much
smaller share of the market, which is limited to specific areas of
high-performance computing and other workloads like security and edge
servers, which have traditionally been on the Unix platform. So this
whole perception of Linux posing a threat to Microsoft does not hold
true. Linux growth is more from the re-platforming of Unix," he adds.

Frost and Sullivan (India) - director ICT, Alok Shende, too, appears to
be in agreement. "Linux is definitely getting into the enterprise.
However, enterprises today need end-to-end solutions. Second, the price
of the OS is a small part of the end-to-end solution. People should look
at the total cost of ownership, which included long-term costs like
services and people availability. Linux has to create a whole market
around the product. While it has matured as a technology, it is wanting
from a business perspective. And that will take some time," he opines.

However, there are major companies that stand aggressively by Linux.
Sandeep Menon, director, Linux Business, Novell West Asia, opines that
Linux is increasingly being used as a platform of choice for
mission-critical applications.

"Several mainframes and super computers are running Linux. Linux is also
been embedded in routers and telecom equipment. It is used by some of
the largest banks, airlines and Internet engines in the World. What else
can be more critical?" he asks.

He adds that with proprietary software, the customer is totally at the
mercy of vendor. If the vendor discontinues support for any reason, the
customer can't do anything. In the case of Open Source Linux, even if
the vendor stops support, the customer can go to anyone else for support
or even support it using his/her own resources, given that the source
code will be available.

Ashutosh Dhanesha, country manager, Linux Business, IBM India, concurs:
"Linux gives customers choice. Our philosophy on "Freedom of choice" for
software, hardware and services and leadership in industry standards
provides customers with security, flexibility and control of their IT
infrastructure and applications. We see Linux moving to mission-critical
applications such as ERP and even high end applications such as Seismic
data analysis."

"Linux is the most proactive as far as security is concerned. With a
million eyeballs looking continuously at the code, bugs are fixed faster
than they can be exploited. As opposed to a licensing approach that
proprietary platforms follow, we sell subscriptions, wherein customers
are automatically covered for upgrades and updates," says Tapia.

Experts opine there is a Rs 600-crore (Rs 6 billion) market for open
source software which is growing at a compounded annual growth rate of
35-40 per cent. A sharp rise in enterprise-wide adoption of Linux or
Open Source is one of the primary reasons for this optimism.

Gartner predicts that by 2008, 95 per cent of Global 2000 organisations
will have formal open-source acquisition and management strategies. The
Penguin, it appears, will give its competitors an icy path to walk on.

Penguin facts

* Linux is expected to have a 15 per cent share of the ERP market by
2007 (Peerstone Research)

* 55 per cent of all companies deployed Linux by the end of 2005 (AMR
Research)
   
* There are over 1.2 million developers with Linux skills (Evans Data
Corp)

*  IBM has more than 7000 services professionals working with Linux

* Robert Francis Group (IBM-sponsored research) found security levels in
Linux generally exceeded those in Windows, providing a more secure and
manageable environment out of the box with significantly more
functionality in terms of security integration and management

* The Linux kernel programming code is better and more secure than the
programming code of most proprietary software - based on a four-year
analysis of the 5.7 million lines of Linux source code conducted by five
Stanford University researchers

Long time ago, in the dark ages of the Browser Era was IE, Firefox
came along to enlighten the masses.

History repeated when iTunes came along and brought along with it DRM
and the dark ages set in on the online audio/video era.

Enter Songbird: http://songbirdnest.com
iTunes days are numbered.
Give it a year. :-)

There is no such thing as "debian FHS". There is an FHS, developed by
the Free Standards Group. The FSG has several members, including most
of the major Linux distributions - take a look at
http://www.freestandards.org/about/members.php. They are all at
varying levels of FHS compliance.

To the OP: If you want to use RPM packages, use an RPM based distribution.

Hello all,

             Though we all accept hacking as a ethical issue, a google
search returns the following as a part of the result:

Hacking means illegally accessing other people's computer systems for
destroying, disrupting or carrying out illegal activities on the
network or computer systems.

But a search for password cracking returns:

Password cracking is the process of recovering secret passwords stored
in a computer system. The purpose of password cracking might be to
help a user recover a forgotten password (though installing an
entirely new password is less of a security risk), to gain
unauthorized access to a system, or as a preventive measure by the
system administrator to check for easily crackable passwords.

If a Google search threw up some web page, what is expressed there is

It was not some web page.It was the google's define:hacking that
returned the result. I think it is from some good dictionary..

The define: <some word> does not return results from the same web site,
or a "good dictionary" every time. Google simply returns results from
web pages that according to it define the word you searched for.

If you had a website that had a high page rank on Google, and you
defined some word on it, chances are it will appear on the "define"
results on Google.

Sorry, I used the term rather loosely.

I intended to mean the unique way Debian lays out files, especially in /etc and
/var.  A good source of annoyance for people moving to Debian is /etc/bind,
/etc/exim4 and /etc/apache2.

May not really solve the OP's problem.  If all he wants to do is
install a single
RPM package, then installing an entire RPM based distro is an overkill.  More
over, it would move him away from Debian!!

Meaning of the word is what the audience interpret it as. If the audience
are non-geeks then a 'hacker' is a bad guy. But since the non geeks
out-number geeks by orders of magnitude, thier view will prevail :-) I guess
thats how words evolve.

Our newspapers classifieds abound in grooms seeking 'homely' brides.
Fortunately for them the meaning of this word (as interpreted by the bride
and her folks) is exactly the opposite of what it means in the dictionary!

Anyway, 'whats in a word!'

hi prabhat,

Thanks for taking initiative. let me add some more.

I attended his seminar (7th Apr) yesterday at I2IT,pune .  This time
also he didnt get time for questions-answers .In his seminar, he
defined 'hackers' - good people who work with security guy for ethical
purpose and 'crackers' - computer criminals who steals passwords, does
financial harms, etc. Now, his seminar was full of password cracking
tools. he taught there - How to do attacks on site with hiding their
identity.  how can we use trojans to harm to remote computer. howto
send forged emails. how can one deface website and how can he order
jewelry for free with love demo.

My claim - Is this comes under ethical hacking or cracking as per your
definition? do public really need to be taught these things to secure
their machines? and why dont you encourage them to use secure browsers
like opera, mozilla? if he says many websites/proprietary softwares
steals users information, why not ask them to move to open source
world? why you do not tell them that most secure way of using internet
is to use net as non-root user in linux box?  :-\

people here are talking about ankit fadia like hes the next jesus
because he is young and wrote a book. whats so hard about that? , you
can compile the information from the internet ,rewrite it and throw in
some remarks about this you understand, then make it read nice and you
have a book. he said he wrote his first book in 15 days. my claim - I
could have done same in 2 days.  ;-)

if u think he is quite young , then compare him with all those 12-13
years old kids from US who wrote big viruses/worms that caused
billions of dollars damage to US.

he does not talk about stack manipulation, reversing os hooks , kernel
data structures. he does not owe any security research. He just keeps
knowledge abt how hackers hack. Is that make him big hacker? and if he
is so big hacker, why doesnt defcon , blackhat meetings entertain him?

In his doordarshan interview, he told that he is working for many
multinational security companies and can not revel their names for
security reasons.  =)) =))

My claim - I am working for a single multinational security company
that is on the top of all your fucking companies and can not revel
their names for the same. :-D

ankit's own opinion abt his book(copy-pasted from
http://neworder.box.sk/forum.php?did=edge317&thread=23811 )

I am not at all the youngest hacker in the world and definitely not
even the youngest writer in the world, neither do I have any desire to
become so. The media has been responsible for giving me titles, which
I am no way going to accept. I do not know everything there is to know
about computer security and believe that every single individual
registered at Neworder can definitely teach me a lot.... My first book
is strictly meant for newbies who are starting out in the hacking
scene. It does not talk about much advanced stuff and may not be
useful to seasoned computer security experts.


for more analysis - read all postings 
http://neworder.box.sk/forum.php?did=edge317
So... he says his book is for newbies...  for those of you whoever
found his book facinating, you are newbie.  There is a lot to learn
about hacking.

>From hindustan times

The Americans had tried almost everything, but they just couldn't
crack an encrypted message they came across while investigating the
9/11 attacks. Finally, they approached a 17-year-old boy in Delhi
about whom The New York Times had done a feature. Over the next 10
days, Ankit Fadia hunkered down in his room in Delhi and came up with
the key to crack the message.

so what was NIST,NCSC and NSA were doing at that time? they created
cryptography standards, algorithms and they need ankit to recognize
their own algorithms implemented. cryptography is one of the most
complex mathematics division!! NSA is the largest employer of
mathematicians in the world !!!

 And what was ankit doing when NIST announced 'call for algorithm' for
AES? and how does classified intelligence agency in which he works
allow him to disclose that he decrypted laden's men's message? my
claim - this agency came to me first for decryption. but I was
involved in secret project of NASA that time. =)) Actually Osama has
not been tracked till now. The question comes, why U.S. government did
not continue to take help of Ankit till osama is physically captured??


If u search on the google for ankit fadia, this will be the first
link. http://www.rediff.com/search/2002/apr/18ankit.htm His claim is
that he found in chat conversation that pakistani hackers are going to
hack some indian site and he reported it to US spy organisation and
that spy organisation warned that site. So what is he doing when 50-60
indian sites are hacked by paki group daily? Here is the AIC(Anti
India Crew - paki hacker group) explanation about above rediff article
on the defaced website

http://www.zone-h.org/defaced/2002/04/26/bhelapp.bhelhyd.co.in/ and
even if somebody heard hacking chat conversation and reported to that
site, is that make him big hacker? and why didnt he accept challenge
of AIC when AIC has announced that it would be defacing the website of
the Central Board of Excise and Customs , www.cbec.gov.in within two
days and challenged Ankit Fadia to prevent the defacement?
http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/04/30/stories/2002043002271300.htm


let me give it a final shot. his own website ankitfadia.com was
hacked.(it seems that he sold this domain to some search engine
company these days.)

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/141313.cms he says he
could not do anything as it was dos attack. In his rediff article he
told he uploaded site with anti-cracking software and stopped site
from being hacked. then how did dos attack finished his own site?  
even his company website - e2-labs.com was defaced. check
http://zone-h.org/en/news/read/id=3861/

Then why is he so popular??  because Indian people dont verify
information. Media likes to create hype. can you recall uri gellar?
some days ago, ankit said he is going to open food restaurant in pune.
media stated - running restaurant is just a trick. he is doing some
secret projects.  =)) =))

now do you still believe he is good hacker?

Hi Quizzers,

Gyaan.in is a NON-PROFIT GROUP/ENGINE/COMMUNTIY that
aims to instill the Quizzing Culture in the Indian
Subcontinent and further the same enthusiasm and enery
by bringing together some of the best minds present in
the quizzing world.Though there are numerous
Yahoo/Google groups that cater to specific segments of
the Quizzing world, Gyaan.in would form a SINGLE stop
for all the gyaan (knowledge) and trivia
available.Gyaan.in would try to maintain and enhance
the Best-Quality-Standards in the Quizzing Arena.

http://gyaan-in.blogspot.com

If any of you is interested in the
operations/activities of Gyaan.in and would like to
align yourselves with this endeavour , please do
kindly get in touch with me.

Short Term Goals:
# Get a domain registered exclusively for Gyaan.in
# The domain would also have Discussion and Trivia
boards that would form a platform for all the quizzers
to share various information and trivia.
# Host an ice-breaker quiz asap across various
Quizzing circuits in India.

Long Term Goals :
# Conduct and co-ordinate Quizzes at various Schools,
Colleges and Corporate Houses.
# Get sponsorships and financial-aids which would be
used as a Charity Fund for upliftment of the
downtrodden and the under-privileged sections of the
society.

Again, I would like to state that Gyaan.in is a
NON-PROFIT COMMUNITY of QUIZZERs, and there are no
business motives behind this.

Yes... I have been using the debian distro for more than a year now
and i really enjoy using it. So i dont like to install a RPM based

Hello all,

        Is there any way in which pdf and document files(both .sxw and
the .doc files mounted from the windows partition) can be opened from
the CUI. I use Debian sarge in my system.

Hi Chaks,

I'm able to run my pyqt apps without invoking  terminal. I just created a
New Link to application on my desktop for one of my pyqt pythons scripts and
just double clicked the icon and it ran my py script without invoking a
terminal.

I don't know about pdf and doc, but sxw is basically an xml file, any images 
and a bunch of metadata dumped into a zip file. Extract it as a zip, and you 
should be able to hack the XML...

Oh, the joys of RPM hell... Well, the Debian folks don't want to lose a 
user either ;-) OP, you can use alien to happily convert rpm to deb files.

apt-get install alien

Then man alien should solve your problem (sorry if somebody already 
suggested this).

What do you refer by "customization" ?! Throw some more light on your 
requirements. We use Open Office in our office for all our tasks :)

I can only request you not to be so blatant in expressing your
anti-whatever distro feelings...

(I am sorry, but I couldn't resist saying this, and I don't want to be
flamed!)

What you say is much like "I don't like coffee, I like only tea. So
you should also stop drinking coffee, drink only tea!".

Please do not be so blatant in your anti-propaganda of other
distros. Every distro has its own problems:

http://www.germane-software.com/~ser/Files/Essays/RPM_Hell.html

Though yum has solved most of these problems, I still cannot forget
the troubles I underwent in trying to install packages through RPM on
an earlier FC installation which didn't have net connection...

hmmm!  Might as well tell us what's that "one package" is :-)  Have
you check backport.org, Ubuntu .deb? I don't quarantee but the one
package (.deb) I took from  Ubuntu repository works well  on Sarge.
You might try that path too.

+1. I used SuSE 8.x to 9.1and RedHat 7.1 to 9. I can still remember 
desperately trying to find some combinations of rpms (I think it was for 
gaim) for SuSE. The first time I installed Debian with Asokan's help,

Make sure #!/usr/bin/env python is the first line in your file and the
permissions are set to 755 (use chmod 755 <filename>)

If that doesn't work, just try #!/usr/bin/python as your first line.

Also make sure your /etc/resolv.conf has the "nameserver" entry.
Mine is "nameserver 192.168.1.1" where 192.168.1.1 is my router/modem.
Yours should be a router/modem or the BSNL nameserver.

pffft!

Tell that to debian-unstable.
Had to wrestle with it for a day to get GNOME 2.14 as my desktop environment.

Well worth the fight though. G2.14 is awesome performance-wise.You can
actually feel the "goodness" in this release.

I suggest old-debianites to try it out if they are GNOME fans and
don't mind fighting with apt for a day.

For others, Just use KDE! ;)

He is able to ping with IP address and domain, so this
is ok.

I use it like this for a LAN:

1. Your default route as seen from the output of
"/sbin/route" should be to your router/gateway:

For example:

0.0.0.0 10.0.0.254 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth0

2. Your /etc/resolv.conf should have nameservers
pointing to your ISP DNS.

3. In browser settings, set it to direct connection to
the Internet.

Regards,

SK

Is the script executable? Did you do the top line (#!/usr/bin/python)? What 
have you setup KDE to use for python files? Probably one of the three...

Yep, and that also vindicates his routing table.

He has tried two browsers, so I'm inclined to think that there might
be a firewall somewhere blocking his port 80 traffic.

I have found tcptraceroute -
http://michael.toren.net/code/tcptraceroute/ - to be an invaluable
tool for troubleshooting these kind of issues.

1) The script is executable
2) Its gets executed in Konsole
3) I  tried with both #!/usr/bin/python and #!/usr/bin/env python , it did
not work via desktop icon

Can you please explain what settings should i check in KDE for python files?
. This one task is pending and it is taking lot of time :(. I would be happy
if i could get help.

Thanks in advance.

Hmm... so it is fine when official distro packages of Debian are
unstable, but not when some randomly downloaded non-distro-endorsed
3rd party RPM file isn't?

Dunno about RPM based distro, but no RPM is good for Debian, because
the supported packaging system is not RPM-based. Debian offers you the
choice - go for unstable if u r a developer and don't mind the fight
involved in installation, or randome crashes; or for testing or stable
- I have never spent anything more than a few minutes on any
installation or upgrade with my Debian testing box....

Looks like I've started an rpm vs apt war... Sigh!

Debian's strength is far beyond a fancy package manager.  The advantages that
I find with Debian are:

 1. Debian means quality, quality means Debian.

    Apt, documentation, standardization, compilation options/flags, everything
    speaks of deliberate thought and careful attention to detail.  IMO
    Debian's cleanliness is second only to NetBSD, see:
        http://netbsd.org/Goals/system.html

    I can remember other Linux distros including poorly optimized math libs
    that produced incorrect results, releasing unofficial versions of GCC
    (remember kgcc?) and such screw ups.

    I have far better faith in Debian.


 2. Social contract and adherence to Debian Free Software Guidelines.

    See http://www.debian.org/social_contract.  Crystal clear project goals.
    IMO, Debian beats even the BSDs here.


 3. Debian is 100% volunteer driven and non-profit.  Embodies the true spirit
    of Open Source.


 4. Liberal organizational structure.  Debian elects it's project leaders in
    the same way we elect our Government.


 5. Debian is an OS and therefore much more than just a Linux kernel and
    userland.  Debian runs on - Hurd, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenSolaris.


  6. Runs on multiple hardware - x86, alpha, sparc, ppc, arm, etc.  Other
    distros have at some point dropped support for unpopular platforms (alpha,
    sparc) due to lack of customer demand.

    Trivia: WinNT 4.0 ran on x86, alpha and MIPS.  And what remains now?

    Standardizing on the same distro on for _all_ your platforms is a
    tremendous win in a medium/large environment.  Training your sysadmin
    staff, scripting and maintenance is so much easier.


  7. Debian tools - apt, dpkg, etc. - have found their way into other systems
    Eg. fink.sf.net brings Debian's tools to Mac OSX.

    There was even a port of apt to Windows!  Web search for debian-win32.


 8. Debian developers contribute extensively to upstream code.


 9. The release streams - stable, testing, unstable - rather than versions
    ensures that "stable" really does undergo thorough real-world testing.


Hmmm...  Debian sounds more like a way of life (a religion?) to me.

wrong analogy - it's like saying, if you have a petrol car, put 
petrol in it, even if it will also sun on kerosene and kerosene is 
cheaper. It will run on kerosene no doubt, but ...

there is no animosity - if you want debian use debian way, if you 
want gentoo use gentoo way, if you want rpm use distros that follow 
the rpm way - if you want source, use distros that like you to 
install from source - dont mix things up

I think the only solution to this is,
your firefox is using IPv6 by default, disable it by going to
about:config in your browser (type about:config in your browser address bar)
i think its network.dns.disableIPv6 to true,
by default it is set to false,
try this and respond,
bye

I think its for sure the problem is not with resolv.conf this is because
ping wont work if resolv.conf is not set.

That is highly subjective. Are you saying that the other distros are
lacking in quality?

Don't forget that Debian's had its own problems too. Till a few months
ago, Debian had no security advisories for months.

Well, if you are saying Open Source does indeed mean non-profit (ie,
no revenues, no salaries, no expenses) then yes. The rest of us can
feel hunger.

Have you seen the kind of governments we get?

WinNT 4.0 is now retired software. But it did indeed run on x86, alpha
and MIPS until its last day.

You yourself have stated above that the other distros stopped
supporting these platforms because they lacked customer demand. I find
that the fact that Debian supports these no-demand platforms increases
its response time for software updates, new releases etc. since they
need to be tested on so many platforms.

So what. Other distro tools have found their way into Debian too. I
think dpkg-reconfigure uses newt (or whiptail?), which is a 100%
Redhat innovation.

>  8. Debian developers contribute extensively to upstream code.

So does other distros. In fact, Redhat goes several steps ahead - it
contributes code, pays the bills and employs several of the upstream
developers.

As someone else pointed out, RHEL, Fedora and Rawhide. Just the fact
that non-Debian users aren't as vocal or boisterous as Debian users
doesn't mean that Debian's the only one with all the real-world
features.

Could be. And I pity you in the same way I pity people who consider
Sai Baba or Mata Amritanandamayi as their god or way of life or
whatever.

You can make it default Window manager by

if .xsession does not exist 

or edit .xsession if it exists and add enlightenment. 

make sure that .xsession file has executable bit set.

Mr. Subramanian, with all due respect, Debian is just a distribution of
Linux.. and Linux is just an OS. That is - Its just a tool. It is perhaps
useful to solve some problems, for others you need to use something else.

When you make it up to be more than what it really is, you lose your
objectivity and that is sad if you are a professional who is expected to
come up with a solution which meets particular needs. If your 'religion'
prevents you from thinking objectively, then it pretty much compromises
your professional standing.

I am not in anyway trashing Debian or any other Linux distribution - I am
just trying to highlight the fact that it really doesn't qualify to be
called a 'way of life' or a 'religion'.

Thanks,
Prem Kurian Philip

Sort of. But's that's my view. Your view may be quite the opposite,
and you are entitled to have your point of you just like I am.

http://www.dccalliance.org/ shows how people can make money from OSS
projects, and still contribute to OSS. People are making money using
Debian.

The fact here is that RH is wanted to make money, and started Fedora
et al as an afterthought for community participation, which is very
good. But Debian is built around the community, and people are now
making money off it.

Right. You should belong to a dictatorial regime. There are a few
souls who believe that though democracy is out, it is for the best
interest of the lagest section of people, rather than serving most of
the interests of a single group (or company).

Accepted. That is about Free Software, isn't it? Innovations are to be
shared. You needn't pat Red Hat for doing something they should be
doing anyway. For that matter, apt is available in RPM. In fact, the
first thing I do on any Fedora system is yum install apt.

Good for them.

I just cannot comment. Nobody said Debian is the only have-it-all
distro. I just say I like it, let me like it even if you don't! Debian
has it's own problems, RH/Fedora has different problems.

Poor comparison.

And  guess this thread is going nowhere. I will not make further
posts. I am just happy that we all have the freedom to choose from a
wide variety of distros, package management systems and software. So,
the freedom wins!

Debian might have it's own problems, but I contest the second statement:

http://www.debian.org/security/

Where you can find advisories from 1997.

I can't see any missing months here either:

and to add some ghee to the flames - is it something to be proud of to
have security advisories? Django, for example, hasnt issued a *single*
security advisory - does it mean that django is crap?

we don't verify the information/promises and track record of any one and

Latter he is proved to be just a joker and then every one who supported him

We need to inculcate the habit of verifying the tenacity of information we

Hi Raja,

> Looks like I've started an rpm vs apt war... Sigh!

I know there is no point in distro wars, but I just can't stop myself
from saying that every single advantage that you stated for Debian is
also valid for Gentoo :)

IMO Gentoo is far more "geekish" that Debian. May not be the kind of
Linux suited for Newbies, but if you're a developer then Gentoo is a
choice to contend with.

+1 to emerge!

Just because Linus said it doesn't make it true!

The war between distros, window managers and text editors is endless.

No explanations? May I know who this "intelligent"
friend is?

Each operating system and its data sits on a separate
partition. They don't interfere with each other. 

   ----------
   |  MBR   |
   ----------
   |        |
   |  OS 1  |
   |        |
   ----------
   |        |
   |  OS 2  |
   |        |
   ----------

At any instant only one operatig system runs on the
processor. Even on an SMP, an instance of the
operating system runs on each processor.

1.Your friend is wrong!
2.The Windows problem is not due to GNU/Linux. I doubt whether you
  will get help from this forum, but all the best.

Your friend may not be wrong entirely.  I've not installed & used any
recent versions of Windows any later than WinNT, so I may be wrong.

During the MSDOG, Windows 9x/NT days, these OSes had trouble if
there's more than one primary partition.  So, the trick is to hide the
any other primary partition (at least FreeBSD since it can't boot off
a non-primary) from Windows and install Windows.

There are quite of lot of partition managers that can do this for you.
 So, the answer is, yes you don't need to remove GNU/Linux for
installing Windows.

I don't think I've ever been so badly misunderstood or misquoted.  Ever!
Either that, or Binand, you were trolling.  And I'm not interested in war.

I'm not stating that Debian is superior, or that it's right for you. 
I wanted to
make the point that even most Debian users themselves don't realise --
Debian goodness goes far beyond apt.  That's it.

well.. that's the difference between a business-centric and a
volunteer-driven systems. we are not working out demand-supply
equations here. the point is, there are still people who work on such
platforms, and debian caters to them...

nobody denies the involvement of redhat and other distros. the spirit
of free software lies in sharing code. every distro worth its name has
packages which have been accepted by other distros.

trouble is, not everyone can afford a RHEL... looks like you need to
be economically well off to get something stable. thankfully, Debian
doesn't have such preconditions.

it moves on...

What I meant was that you may have KDE set up to open python files (in Kate or 
something) instead of running. Upon checking, I find that this is of no help. 
But then again, my system runs python apps from a link with no trouble at 
all.

Yeaa, this is the point. The point isn't that you can't install
Windows when Linux is already there. The thing is system parition 
(i.e. where you have  winnt or windows  folder)  must be a primary
partition.

Yea, "its not installing" isn't  enough to understand the problem. Did
it say something like  Windows cannot be installed on this partition.

OTOH, why use something else like "Dual boot pro" when GRUB can do the
work neat enough?

One more thing you can try. If you it were running before, chances are
Windows is indeed on a primary partition. Why don't you boot into
Linux and check if that windows partition is marked active.

Nope, XP can be quite accomodating with other OSs. Just be sure to replace 
Linux's bootloader later... :)

No, I didn't know that. :) I honestly didn't. Also, for the record I
didn't mean any insult. So I hope that settles it.

In anycase since that particular stipulation doesn't make any sense to me,
I might still continue to refer to people as Mr.

ok - now to stoke another fire - how many people here would move to using
Mac OSX instead of Linux on their desktops if Apple releases Mac OSX for
intel machines other than Apple branded ones? I am not implying that Apple
would do such a thing (my guess is that they won't). I am just curious. :)

In that case ur gaim also wont work. so, better disable ipv6 on the whole
system by

To disable IPV6: As root, you must add the line: "alias net-pf-10 off"
(without quotes)
to the end of your /etc/modprobe.conf file.

2) So it's primary partition and marked active.

3)  Just blank, *weird*!.  Got a different windows install CD? Is it
possible to try that Windows Install disk on a different machine.

Sounds to me more of a Windows issue. Did you happen to try any of the
options under Advance ...(how do you call that... options you get
after pressing F8) such as last known good configuration.

I have FC4.When i am tring to fsck my root partition manually,got to
truble.It warned that root is mounted,but unfortunatly i pressed y..so
it goes some binary data screen.and i given crtl+c..and "#umount / -l"
which unmounted it.Then whole system hangs.
after i rebooting i got only grub command line.Well, i can load a
chainloader +1 and get in to windows however.But here is a problem
comes for Linux(FC4).

grub>root (hd0,6)
Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0*83
grub>kernel (hd0,6)/
Error 17:Can not mount selected partition


I am sure partition no is right.Seems that ext3 filesystem
corrupted.No way to rectify and rescue a root data's??Right.

   Hey LUGies,
   Today I totally got rid of the last traces of 'Jannal' :D by installing
   Ubuntu 5.10 over my windows partition. The installation went fine and
   after logging in, I tried to start my braodband(BSNL). It was all fine,
   after initial failures as i had forgot the password. After finally making
   it up, i tried Gaim and Firefox. Gaim connected, but after a few minutes
   it goes blank. I have to logoff and login back to connectit again, which
   goes off after a few minutes. With firefox, the web pages doesnot openup
   or refresh at the first attempt. For isntance, if i type google.com and
   click enter... the page doesnot open. It remains at "connecting
   google.com" I have to keep pressing enter two or three times to make it
   open google. The same happens after tht, with everytime i want to open a
   different page, i have to try atleasr a couple of times.

   I doubted the connection and checked it in my FC4. Everything is pretty
   usual here :) Also, apt-get is not able to find any apps, like emacs and
   xmmms. When i try "apt-get install" with them, it says it dint find the
   app with the name. Isnt there a command like in YUM, to check the
   application we are trying to install "Yum search xmmms" used to show the
   apps available with the name xmmms in them. Do we hacve to add
   repositories as in YUM, in apt-get also ??

I did not check my mail for a few days and what do i find, RPM/APT,
KDE/GNOME, ..
This is also not anyway close to a distrowar as a few noted, it is an
expression of likin. If u like a girl/boy, it does not imply that even your
best friend should. So dont get worked up about such mails. they are worth a
read, and everything that is attributed to any software on the web should be
taken with a pinch of salt.
Linus likes KDE , fine, let him. But as one GENIUS (sarcasm implied!) gnome
does not suck, nor does kde rock.  If u like fancy colors and hundreds of
apps bundled, use kde. Gnome is more basic, but i find gnome loads faster,
and compiles faster in the gentoo install. So i prefer gnome. Anyone can
download the kde apps. kde apps are mostly just the graphical cover up of
command line commands. After an Arch install I was stuck with command line
for a week. But i fell in love with it. So i got a  DE(gnome in my case) to
use flash and java plugins. I am still not out of the command line habit and
am sending this mail through links.
Now about package managers. None is perfect for me, because perfect as
everything here is relative.
I recently have tried,
fedora5,
ubuntu dapper,
Underground desktop,
Arch Linux,(liked it but pacman kept giving errors)
Linux from Scratch(not successful)
Gentoo.
Soon I analysed the pros and cons of each,
I am going to keep changing distros till i find one. Any different distro,
please recommend. Also is slackware really good or is its installer putting
users, away,(i'll download the iso if one recommends with a reason).
Please excuse any contradictions between the first and last parts of my
mail. the first is my opinion, the last my request!

I absolutely dont have a clue. It works out of the box for me with both 
BSNL[@Home] and Hathway[@Blore] and I use the testing Dapper version.

do a $sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list

And uncomment the lines containing the Universe and Multiverse Repositories.
Then do a
        $apt-get update

After which you can start installing software.

Quite the contrary, if I like a girl I wouldn't want my best friend to
like her too ;)

I agree with you. Command line rocks. But the GUI is still essential for
tasks like browsing the internet or watching your favourite movie, or
playing a game. I haven't managed to do these tasks quite satisfactorily
on the command line.

Oh, and Gnome rocks. Since everyone is expressing opinion, I am of the
opinion that Gnome is a more slicker, and
no-frills-but-gets-the-job-done kind of environment. Just what I want.

You've tried Gentoo right? The Slackware install is no more challenging
than Gentoo's install. If you haven't tried slackware I recommend you
do. That's one distro you wouldn't want to miss.

Tried every available option, but nothing seems to work here  :(.
I tried in FC3 and Yoper. Both same results :(

I would like to say that fedora (redhat sponsered community distro)
also has similar setup as debian. here i feel fedora testing is like
debian unstable ie., meant for developers. Fedora stable is like
debian testing meant for users who would like to use a cuting edge
s/w. Redhat Enterprise is like debian stable something like debian
stable. Since redhat is a company they are slightly tilted towards
money. Thats ok with me. There is also the centOS which you can get
redhat enterprise. I like rpm's . There are also the suse , mandriva ,
etc with rpm. These are completely different from one other (redhat &
others) & they are great. We dont find so much in deb side.

heh heh heh. in the good old days when 4x was a furiously fast READ speed for a
cdrom drive, when most pc's couldn't boot off cd's, before there was redhat,
before there was debian, slackware (on about 50 floppies) was king. the first

Message-ID: <a1da1e5e0604112134r9fbf94aucc168b13a56e5d90@mail.gmail.com>

I have installed Ubuntu 6.06 - Flight-6 (proposed for official release on
June 1st) on my HP nx6120 Laptop. Almost all my problem which I noticed in
previous version (Breezy 5.10) have been solved in this release. Great! Just
within a 5-6 months, all these great things have happened.

Improvements over Breezy version:
1. Faster booting - takes just 55 seconds to get complete desktop (with auto
login) with default installation
2. Nice GUI shutdown
3. Faster GNOME - takes 3-4 seconds to get desktop from gdm.
4. Samba client and Server - I am able to connect to all my Windows PCs and
Servers in LAN without any issues (in breezy, it was not so - the
performance was not consistent). Shared Folder works just like that.
5. SMB Printer config - Able to configure easily, Windows (SMB) Printer
through GUI tool without any issue.
6. Unicode in Firefox - Tamil fonts are perfectly displayed
7. SCIM Input for Tamil - Amazing integration with Text applications such as
gedit and mousepad. This is first time I am able to successfully key in
Tamil in phonetic keyboard layout on Linux. It is just a matter of selecting
language from applet.
8. GNOMEBaker - import session works without any flaw.
9. OpenOffice - starts and works faster
10. GDebi Package installer - Double click .deb file to install it.
11. Power Management - Nice GUI tool for sleep, hibernate controls - (but
sleep and hibernat not working in my laptop - to be tweaked)
12. Better font rendering - additional font settings
13. Simple Sound Preference tool

This is what I am able to write, i might have missed other things. Some body
else can list out. Regarding issues, I will come up with another mail.

Hats off to Open Source - GNU- Linux - GNOME - Ubuntu team!

I am not a webserver admin but, I think if you are just trying to access the
directory , it may give error, try accessing the file name in the directory.
This may be due the reason that, we can config the webserver to allowing
browsing the folder or deny it, I dont know what the default setting.
But this is my option.

What are you trying to access? As someone mentioned in this list, you
might not have enabled "Options indexes" to browse that directory, if
you access it instead of a file under it.

Setting permissions to be world-writable is real bad.  Can you post
the error_log entry when you get the error?

RHEL's MRTG configuration by default allows browsing of graphs
generated only from localhost. This is configured in
/etc/httpd/conf.d/mrtg.conf.

 I have installed Novell linux desktop using NFS network installation. While executing the command "rcnetwork restart", that shows as follows
 
 Shutting down network interfaces:

Do you know the OS on the DHCP server? I find that Microsoft's DHCP
server causes inordinate delays (even for Microsoft-running clients)
when assigning IP addresses.

when you re doing ifconfig its showing ip and gateway stuff rite?
so why do you worry about DHCP no IP address yet message...?
its generally good to background so that you dont need to wait

configure the same  in different interface

for eg. for home use wlan0 and for College use wlan1. if u go home and
start the network, that device wlan0 will be up. if u go college,
wlan1 will be up.

u dont have to manually change anything. give ur ssid in each of the
devices during configuring. i use wifi at office and lan at home. i
have not used any externel tool to switch over. i configured
everything like eth0, wlan0, eth1 etc. try this

Yes, Linux is a big hit i agree but what i found from my experience is that
only a few people come forward to adopt to linux paricularly , from the 
desktop users
if linux is a big hit then there should be more desktop users for linux 
but it is not .
Even i came to know about Linux by my friend, this is how people came to 
know about linux but not by them selves.
Then we can say that linux is a big hit in the corporate and not in the 
desktop users. This is what the article also says.
Yet people should come forward to try linux some distros like Ubuntu , 
Mandriva (forgive me if i left some distros ) are really great and 
provide all apps for day to day usage. The other issue that people are 
concerned with is that lack of support and veryhard to configure so what 
i thik is that we can accelerate this so that we can bring up more users 
show case the different distros rather than having heavy arguments on 
the packaging system .

Cheers,
Prasanna Kumar

Message-ID: <7fa493830604120157x5dc1745et2075b3540175e899@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
	I am Vikram, a n/w administrator at Chennai. I've got
a few issues setting up a proxy/cache server. It would
be great if you guys could help me out.

My goal is to forward requests to a main proxy as well
filter content at my end.

I use Squid 2.5 Stable9

The main proxy uses Squid 2.5 stable 7.

What I've done till now is that, I've tried forwarding
the local client requests to the main 10.8.53.189:8080
server using "cache_peer".

cache_peer 10.8.53.189 parent 8080 0 no-query default

The problem is that we are not able to view secure
sites (https). The settings are all default, so i
guess port 443 is open. And also unable to search in
Google and view few other links in Google, even though
they can be viewed through the main 10.8.53.189 proxy.

The other option i tried was using my squid in the
accelerator mode, with options like httpd_accel_host,
httpd_accel_port, httpd_accel_with_proxy on.
In this mode, i was totally unable to connect to the
internet using the local proxy.

http_access allow localhost
httpd_accel_host 10.8.53.189
httpd_accel_port 8080
httpd_accel_with_proxy on
http_access allow all

The main proxy is not under my control.

I've even tried using Apache in the Proxy mode.
Here, its forwarding the requests to the Main proxy
perfectly. No issues with viewing websites.
But unable to block content using "ProxyBlock"

ProxyRequests On
ProxyRemote * http://10.8.53.189

Other settings are all default.

Suppose i give
Proxyblock .xyz.com
am not able to visit any site. it just times out.

Iam using FC4.
Please help me out.

Gladly. First of all, there are lots of pictures on Flickr and videos on 
YouTube, so  you can check it out here. Also the talks, demos that 
happened there:

http://barcamp.org/BarCampChennai

It was a really cool event - and a resounding success, I should say. 
It's mostly concentrated on Web 2.0 - the technologies, products and 
convergence coming up. It started off with a bang with Kiruba's welcome, 
and there was Narain's talk about what Web 2.0 is all about, a talk on 
SEO techniques by Gopal of rupya.com, a presentation on Project InfraNET 
by Vijay Anad (this not about .Net - it's a really cool project to bring 
IT infrastructure to governement bodies).

And there was the soft launch of Taazza.com, a news portal to be out of 
beta soon (which incidentally, runs on Rails) by Arjun Ram and there 
were several live audiocasts from the founders of Podbazaar.com from the 
US (it runs on CastMetrix, which is written in Common Lisp!!). Atul 
Chitnis gave a talk on how computing as a platform is moving towards 
mobile devices (ok, please spare the obligatory links that some people 
post whenever his name comes up, I find it really pointless).

There were some really cool product demos done by various entrepreneurs. 
The mood was informal, exciting. There were some product demos of 
Windoze Vista by "Microsoft Student Partners" (I think they're being 
exploited by M$) which I couldn't stomach, but well, it's not a Foss 
meet, so I kept silent. Also interesting was the fact that almost 
everybody had a laptop open and were live-blogging away to glory.

I'm not going in an order, but what I also found interesting were talks 
"xDesign: User eXperience Design" by Muthu of Sun Microsystems on how to 
design accessible products. Adding to the whole buzz was a talk on how 
to attract VC capital and also how to make money out of blogging. Very 
interesting stuff, it's amazing that they packed all that stuff into two 
days. Free lunch! Free t-shirts! Awesome. Can't wait for the next one.


Vamsee.

Dear Friends,

Similiar story here, I bought a segate barracuda 7200 rpm 80 gb hard disk,
Intel original D101ggc motherboard, 256 mb ram , Pentium IV 2.8Ghz processor
Samsung52-24-52 rw .
Though the fedore core 4 installation was smooth.Debian sarge 3.1 stable
could not recoganise my Hard disk and turned blood red in color at  the
partition sub menu of the installation. Finding ubuntu 5.04 had hanging
problem during installation . I read few web sites which directed me that a
kernel 2.6.11 or above may solve this problem, i went on finding one ubuntu
5.10 which had the kernel 2.6.12, while on installation it said 'trying to
load module 'ide-cd'  and then frozen. Many similiar reported problem posted
in various web page. any pointers, thanks in advance.


Thanking you

Well I would say Professionals use GNOME.While newbies use KDE.You
need a GUI just to do a certain tasks.... not to see the graphics and
effects.... KDE gives just that.... In my opinion GNOME is better in
prformence...

Well.... If you wish you could choose the stable version of the
debian..... And I have been using Debian for quite some time now. It
has been very fine so far... No problems with anything. And I use
GNOME for GUI. It is  perfect....

For Sarge, the installer uses kernel 2.4 by default. At boot time,
type linux26 to use the 2.6 kernel based installer.

Motherboard and chipset, please?

Ubuntu 5.04, most Gentoo livecds, and perhaps others detect the SATA on my 
NForce 4 board, as well as the Intel 915 board quite well. The only REAL 
problem I faced was that I didn't compile in support for the chipset in the 
kernel and as a result, all DMA shut down in protest. That was easily fixed 
by adding the option in the kernel...

Hello all,

       When I joined the mailing list, one of the first rules were
regarding troll. Now isn't this a troll by Mr.Binand. He openly says
his aim was to pull me out of debian.
When Debian provides everything  that is required, why go for some other distro.
That too, certain distros like the RH are more like the prop
companies....  Requiring licences etc. True followers of the Free
software foundation formed by the GOD RMS must be atleast appreciating
debian...

Stop saying things like "sucky". Shows how unprofessional you are anyway.

You like KDE, We like Gnome. Fullstop.

Oh, and it would be helpful if you could tell us what do you find in
Gnome that's so "sucky". We'll fix it in the next release :/

hello evry1,
i m usin ubuntu rite now and i find life dull and boring with it (it jus
works!!! no problems at all)..
i hav decided to do something adventurous...what could be more fun than
installing gentoo from stage 1..
now i hav this simple query..since gentoo is a meta-distro how does it
handle package updates. i mean do i hav to d/l the entire source tarball
and emerge it or is there anyway i could jus patch the updates to the
code therby d/l only differences between versions..with a bit of
googling i came across this link
http://www.gentoo-wiki.com/TIP_Gentoo_for_dialup_users#getdelta

now by the looks of it..getdelta isnt for gentoo alone..any pointers on
this

btw ubuntu r0x

  The problem continues with linux 2.6 also. Is there any boot
parameters to be given at the boot prompt.Pressing F1 key there gives
a big list of options in Debian. It also has special boot parameters
for special type of systems please check those options....

But Ubuntu 5.10 gets installed in SATA hard disks. But still it has
some problems with the xorg configuration.

And above all, one big problem with Ubuntu 5.10 is that it doesn't
have E.M.A.C.S  one of the best editors( no disrespect to other
editors) from the great RMS himself.... why so?

Thats why they have apt-get so you can choose any of your editors ;-)

you will find that most tutorials on-line (something like the
ubuntuguide) will use gedit. Its not to say that gedit is the best
editor ever. Emacs is a big package come on, the deb without any
dependencies is by itself 20MB. and ubuntu comes packaged in 1 neat CD.

Emacs can be rather large, and Ubuntu makers are nearly always low on
space.  If they added emacs they'd likely have to remove something
else.

Hi all,

after testing step by step what made me not to execute from desktop
launcher, i found it!. I was using the function os.getlogin() to get the
name of the currently  logged in user. This was not allowing me since i
think it runs thru terminal only.

Who said so? Never heard of framebuffer?

Press Control+Alt+F1 to get a console, login as user,
and play a movie using mplayer:

 mplayer movie.file

OR

 mplayer -vo fbdev movie.file

If you have framebuffer support enabled in the kernel,
it should play.

For more options check:

 mplayer -vo help

Well if the game supports frame buffer output, you can
play it in terminals F1-F6.

And yes, command line rocks!

Is it possible for you and Asokan Pichai to give us a

I am sure everyone will be interested in your valuable

No patching work, I believe.

My documentation for your kind perusal (from stage 3):
http://shakthimaan.com/installs/gentoo-hurd-t41.html

I liked Gentoo a lot. It was great fun to build it and
use it.

I will also recommend LFS, if you want to learn a lot.

For the GUI-crazy, we had FVWM and Mosaic. For the others, lynx ruled.
Pine was the universal email reader ("pine me before you leave").

It is amazing that I had used gnuplot/octave/latex etc. in the early
nineties and am still comfortable with them (even though I hadn't
touched these for several years in between).

It might have been removed from the installer CD to accomodate other
important packages.
I'm sure it's available in ubuntu universe repository.

Plus, I'd really request you to address one of the LUG meets, if you
find time. You are one of the "resident technical experts" (from your
website), so I guess you can share with us a few tips, tricks and the
future of ftp.iitm.ac.in.

BTW, what is the future of ftp.iitm.ac.in? I guess except Debian and
the Linux kernel, few things are available; even Fedora has been
removed; due to space constraints, I am sure.

Thanks.

FYI, Debian is NOT listed on GNU's list of free Distros. Remember that
Debian is also not a truly free OS as RMS would like to define! In fact
none of the popular distros that are in use today are actually free in
the original sense of the term.

It's the good ol' fight between the "Free Software" camp and the "Open
Source" camp.

This is not always true, but depends on the applications you run too.

I know people using many non-free software on GNU/Linux, like Komodo
for editing, Adobe Acrobat reader for reading PDF files, etc.

Do you have Sun Java on your GNU/Linux machine?  If you answer a yes,
you need to reconsider/rephrase your "Linux is ..." statement.

As per an unattributed page on the web, RMS uses Ututo-e, a Linux
distribution from Argentina - https://www.ututo.org/www/

I wouldn't doubt that statement, considering Ututo is the first
listing at http://www.gnu.org/links/links.html#FreeGNULinuxDistributions
(where Debian is conspicuously absent).

He mentioned in one talk that he uses Debian, in response to a
question. Could be that he has shifted, though...

I have, and despite trying hard, I could never get it to work properly.
I get black and white stripes all over the screen. And it doesn't even
work as a non-root user.

Another interesting thing I came across though was coloured ASCII art.
It looks pretty cool and "retro", but not quite the real thing. Fun to
see once in a while though :)

Yep, just a few weeks ago I dumped GAIM for CenterICQ, and I'm pretty
happy with it.

You are connecting through the roaring penguin client
(pppoe)?

Do you have a public IP address? Check from the output
of:

 /sbin/ifconfig -a

If yes, do you have your BSNL DNS IP addresses set in
your /etc/resolv.conf file, like this: 

 nameserver 202.96.209.133
 nameserver 202.96.209.5

Test 1: Can you ping your ISP DNS IP address (above)?

 ping 202.96.209.5

Test 2: Can you ping a domain by IP address?

 ping 66.94.230.35

Test 3: Can you ping a domain by name?

 ping www.yahoo.com

Let us know the results,

SK

OSX has a good set of FOSS software. OSX runs both X11 as well as Quartz
compatible software without any issues. GNU toolchain and GCC has been
ported over so most OSS software should work fine. There have been some
notable OSS software which don't work very well though - examples include
OpenOffice.

To answer Gopalarathnam Venkatesan's query about Sun Java not being
available for Linux - that is not true. Sun Java is indeed available for
Linux, it is just that it is not available for all distributions of Linux.

this is true. i installed almost all the software that comes with
Fedora Core 5. no other than this, i have not installed any software
that is not free. even, i use VMware which is now a open source in
beta stage.

i never use Komodo. i use the built-in development tools like vi or emacs
FYI, Adobe provides acrobat reader  which is available for free. check out here

OSX is based on BSD Unix. its not Linux. it can use GNU tools but it
is not available for free.
check out
http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/mac/news/macosx_0301.html
but the articles discussed back in 2001 which has got some outdated
info like macosx runs only apple hardware. except this, u can find
more info related to OSX evolution.

The point which is being made is that Sun Java is *not* FOSS. It is
non-free software. So, if you are saying that Linux is loaded with
FOSS and claim to be using Sun Java, you are using non-free software
for Linux...

For Sarge, the installer uses kernel 2.4 by default. At boot time,
type linux26 to use the 2.6 kernel based installer.

You've got your definition of "free" wrong here. Just because the
software is free to download and costs nothing doesn't make it free
software. You should call it "freeware" instead.

Free software is when the source code of the software in question is
available to the general public. Adobe reader and Sun Java do _not_
satisfy that condition and are hence termed as "non-free" software.

Actually, ever since Mac OSX Panther came out, the GNU compatibility has
gone up considerably. So the issues mentioned in this linked article are
not all true.

It is my opinion that if Mac OSX is released for generic intel boxes, then
it would really pose a problem for Linux. Mac OSX has a lot going for it -
for one thing it is a good distribution of Unix and has the ability to run
both X11 and Quartz apps. It also does this with far more polish than
Linux..MacOSX also feels much better put together than any distribution of
Linux I have tried so far. Many of the mainstream apps such as MS Office,
Quicken, Adobe and Macromedia products etc all work well on MacOSX.

I did. It was good. They mainly focussed on demonstrating commercial
products, web 2.0 technologies, podcasting, corporate blogging and
couple of open source topics (ruby on rails, rich ruby, contributing
to ubuntu, etc.)

In general, IMO, it was a platform for start-ups to demonstrate their
product and market the product to the possible extent. The way they
organised this two day event is plausible. The organisers and
volunteers have done a wonderful job.

As free software? When there is no source code, there
is no "end-user freedom".

Message-ID: <a1da1e5e0604122244g2418931ey36475a482eb0b4be@mail.gmail.com>

I want to share with you my pleasure of having wonderful Tamil support from
Ubuntu 6.06 (Flight-6). I am able to key in the tamil characters in phonetic
mode without any hassles. Switching between Tamil and English just a click
away. Font rendering also found to be good in Firefox and other
applications. But instead of Sans, we have to select other TSCu_* fonts
available for better support.
 I hope now I have crossed another big *NOT IN GNU/LINUX* excuse. Great to
see this!

Note: I think our list member Mukunth (if am not wrong) was annoying some
times before about this tamil support in Linux. I think he reads this mail
and happy about it.

Sure. Vijay is a Canadian-Indian, trying to bring in a National ID kind 
of infrastructure to India. He says that it's very sad that we don't 
even have an account of the deaths in the lower strata in the society. 
As a first step, he is trying to get the local governments at least have 
a good list of people who are living in their constituencies. Each will 
be given an ID, which can be used for different purposes like voter id, 
ration card id, etc. Also, all government bodies will check with this id 
to provide any kind of service, and keep records based on this id.

What is liked about the project is its scope. It's simply mind-boggling 
to imagine getting an id to every person in this country. Obviously, 
Vijay does a better job of explaining what it is all about. You can 
write to him at  vijay AT leadstep D0T com and find out his plans. He is 
looking for some good programmers to work on his ideas. Anybody 
interested, please write to him. He's passionate about this idea and 
fascinating to talk to.

You can thank Mark Shuttleworth for that. He is fanatical about 
excellent localization support. One of the reasons Ubuntu 6.04 became 
6.06 (delayed from April to June) was to provide better polish to the 
distro and add more localization support.

A four-year old opinion piece. The author talks about RFC 822, but it
has been superceded by RFC 2822. The URL posted by Kenneth refuted
this one so nicely that I wouldn't bother :)

I just have this suggestion - why doesn't ilugc enable Reply-To to
itself for a month or so and ask the list members themselves to choose
between the two options?

The one big argument I have in favour of Reply-to is that several
times I notice that when I post something on the list, I get replies
that come to me directly. They are usually a follow-up question or
additional information, and I'm sure once two-three such emails are
exchanged, the poster's problem is solved. But this whole exchange
happens off the list, is not archived, and thus valuable infomation is
lost forever.

Same here.

This comes primarily from students. Most of them will
switch to PM mode, but, what they fail to realize is
that other folks are still following the discussion in
the mailing list.

I never encourage people sending me PM, unless its
really off-topic.

+1. Though I've gotten used to it now, it's slightly annoying that I 
have to take extra care to remove the person's mail id in Thunderbird 
when ever I do a reply-all. Virtually all other mailing lists munge the 
reply-to header. I don't see to any concerns about that in other lists. 
I think the comfort of just hitting reply outweighs other concerns, if any.


Vamsee.

Repeat after me.

Sun JRE/J2SE is NOT Free Software
Adobe Acrobat Reader is NOT Free Software
Realplayer is NOT Free Software

They all might be freeware, but that is purely coincidental.

Out of curiosity, how is this related to GNU/Linux.  Should this be
marked as "Off Topic"?

Hello everybody,

           I have one issue. I have 2 different static IPs configured in my
server. I want to utilise both of the IPs if any of one goes down. For
Example, if u ping google.com, you will get different ip address everytime.
But if you say Whois, it will show you that this is belongs to Google. How
can i set this. In my case i have more than 2 locations  and  do not want to
change their settings each and everytime. How can i do that and how to go
further. Please guide me.

What is connected to the ip? ( web server or mail server..?)

If it is web server set the second ip as the secondary ip for the web
server.

If it  is a mail server point the seconday mx record to the second ip

The way google/yahoo/microsoft do it is by utilizing the services of a
company called akamai (www.akamai.com). Akamai specializes in content
delivery - it makes a best-guess of where on the globe you are and try
to direct you to the nearest datacenter where the content is hosted.
With one webserver and two IP addresses, this is not what you want to
do (unless you have $$$ to burn).

With two IP addresses on the same server, uplinked to two different
ISPs, your choices are limited. You can try stunts like automatically
detecting when one of the links is down and updating your DNS record
accordingly, but the DNS caching works against you.

For the low investment type people, there isn't much of a solution to
this problem except ensuring that your link does not go down.

My comment was specifically about the three pieces of software above
(two were referenced in this thread, the third I added myself).

In any case, part of Darwin's source code is released under APSL v2,
and FSF's opinion of that license can be read at
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/apsl.html

<quote>
The FSF now considers the APSL to be a free software license with two
major practical problems, reminiscent of the NPL:

    * It is not a true copyleft, because it allows linking with other
files which may be entirely proprietary.
    * It is incompatible with the GPL.
</quote>

(Remember, the first of those - that it required linking against a
non-Free library - is the reason all the GPL fanatics were against the
KDE project, and GNOME's raison d'etre).

No. We are running servers on low cost lines.
With two different ips.

The procedure varies and depends on what is connected to the ip. ( mail
server / webserver / vpn database etc)

In my case it is a Mail server. Im having inhouse server and 2 MX records.
But i want my people from other location to access my any one of Static IP.
Two IPs are always up. If one IP rejected the request or down or too Busy,
it should automatically switch to another IP. If i ping my server it should
ping both the IPs like google and yahoo.

I did read your response in this thread. Let me explain to you the
flaw of that approach.

Say you have www.foo.com with two IPs, IP1 and IP2. You add those in
the authoritative DNS server for foo.com as:

www.foo.com.       86400     IN      A       IP1
www.foo.com.       86400     IN      A       IP2

Now, there is nothing in the RFCs that tells the clients to try these
IPs in any set order, or something that forces them to try all these
IPs. So, you can expect roughly half your clients to connect over IP1
and the other half to connect over IP2. Now you can see that when your
IP1 is down, half your clients will not be able to connect to your
webserver. They wouldn't try the other IP as DNS responses are cached.

Are you having single mail server or two mail servers
and what is mta ( sendmail/qmail or postfix)

If it a sigle system, configure the mail server to handle multiple mail
domains and set the second mx as secondary mail domain and and connect both
ip s to the same machine.

We use 2 different systems with 2 different ips/mx just to ensure that
we dont loose any mails in case of a failure of one line or one
system.Wekeep one as primary and the other as secondary. Fetchmail is
run at a
constant intervals (say 3 minutes) in the primary server to connect to the
secondary.

This is now being offered as a bundled service by most of the guys like
vsnl/satyam etc . They call it  " catchall mails service " They will act as
a secondary server for you.

Dude, get the basics. An OS exists on a separate
partition. At any instant only one OS can run on a
processor. What you do with GNU/Linux has nothing to
do with windoze.
 
Anyways, this is not a windoze $upport mailing list.

I will discuss w.r.t. Fedora Core.

Set 61.1.96.71 as your ISP DNS address in
/etc/resolv.conf. No need of 192.168.1.1.
 
 nameserver 61.1.96.71

I meant your DNS IP address, 61.1.96.71.

Change your DNS and you should be able to ping
yahoo.com.

True, but I'm curious how you handle this problem for the POP server
that would presumably run on this mail server.

I think in KDE you can do this associativity in
Control Center, not sure though.

Yes, but, it depends on your desktop environment.

No, it does have.  Thats the way to create a Firefox/Thunderbird
distribution.  The option mentions to use the JPEG, PNG libraries that
are bundled along with the Mozilla source.

I haven't setup the latest version yet, but some people are reporting 
something of a related error on the rails list. Try putting this in your 
config/environment.rb:

RAILS_GEM_VERSION = '1.1.2'


If this doesn't solve your problem, the please post the same question here:

http://lists.rubyonrails.org/mailman/listinfo/rails

They're very helpful, you'll get an answer almost instantly. If you're 
ready to drink the rails koolaid, welcome to the club:

OK.

This arrangement only ensures that no mails are bounced back in case of a
line failure. But the mail system will be fully functional only after the
lines are restored.

Line failures are resorted quickly now a days. As per our records, whole of
last year, our lines failed 5 times. 4 times it was restored in less than
one hour. One time it was 3 hours.

When the lines failed, the outgoing mails of the users in the lan were
received, and kept in the queue of the primary server. The incoming mails
are received, and kept in the queue of the secondary server. With in an hour
all were cleared.

During all these failures, there was a delay in the mails but NO mail was
missed. The users were able to go on, with out noticing much of a
difference.

Practically, in one whole year, a few hours delay, is a decent compromise to
agree upon for such a low cost lines.

Message-ID: <042f01c65fcd$eff19840$6200a8c0@JANANI>

Hi all,

Greetings from Linux for You (www.lfymag.com) 

In order to increase people-orientation and GNU/Linux users' participation
in LFY, we have decided to introduce a new section (sorry, we are still
racking our brains for the 'perfect' name) in the magazine, where GNU/Linux
users can share their opinions regarding one interesting topic each month.

Every month our team will decide on a question or topic and mail it to
various ILUG mailing lists. We hope that the ILUG members will
enthusiastically share their opinions on the subject. The team picks the
best responses and publishes it in LFY. The answers can be technical,
humorous or radical (you may give a totally new perspective to the topic
being discussed).

This month we've decided to start with the topic, "Why is it that 8 of the
world's top 10 supercomputers are powered by GNU/Linux?"

We request all those who are interested to kindly send in your responses to
this question to Janani (writetojanani@gmail.com) with a CC to Atul
(atul@efyindia.com).

We really hope you are as enthusiastic as we are about this.

Look forward to your responses.

Thanks and regards,

Good idea.

Good topic.If you could give some basic facts which will help
non-supercomupter/clustering geeks then it will be more helpful.Just a
few links will do.This way people who are alien to the subject can
also contribute.

Instead can't we have a general LUG-type discussion on the LUG mailing
list and you can just grab the "juicy" bits and put them as an opinion
on LFY.Something like kerneltraffic.

Example:
Mr. X from ILUGC says that "Linux Supercomputers are the best for
Fortune 500 companies because of foo,bar etc..".

Hi,

Thanks for the really prompt response and for supporting our initiative.

Hmm... good idea. But, I would rather not give too many details about 
supercomputers, clusters et al, because then people will begin to think too 
technically. We'd like some radical/humorous responses as well, right?

So, here's what I suggest: I'll give you the list of some of the 
supercomputers that run GNU/Linux and you can Google their names and check 
it out. Sounds ok?

1) IBM Blue Gene/L
2) Silicon Graphics' Columbia
3) ASC Purple
4) Dell Thunderbird
5) Cray Red Storm Cray XT3
6) NEC Earth Simulator
7) IBM MareNostrum
8) Cray Jaguar Cray XT3

Again a good idea, but sometimes the thought of being published might cause 
people to shy away from a discussion! So, let's have this as a discussion on 
ILUG-C, but at the same time, let's be clear on the fact that unless you CC 
the mail explicitly to me and Atul, we will not consider it for publication. 
That way we achieve the best of both worlds: the topic gets discussed on the 
mailing list, and at the same time we won't be scaring away the media shy 
people from this discussion. What say you?

Thanks,
Janani

boot, it boots properly, and everything goes fine . But the first 2 times I
encounter the error mentioned above(peculiar eh!). I'm unable to make any
sense on how it is able to boot properly every third time and why it reports
that it cant execute rc script for the first 2 times. I'm facing this
problem only for the last 2 days; everything was going fine till before
that. Plz help me resolve this problem.

I currently have an HP SR1300 IL pc that comes with an Agere modem  inbuilt. I dont use this pc for connecting to the net except when i am  at home once a month. The problem with this modem is that, i get a  driver which supports only the kernels 2.6.0test5_2 and 2.6.0test5_2(SMP). The  kernel is provided only with the TurboLinux 10 Desktop distro. Oflate,  my Turbolinux doesnt go beyond the partitioning and says that there is  a bug in the installer, Mongoose. I have Ubuntu 5.10 with me. Will it  boot and run properly if i try to compile an older kernel. Regarding  the bug, is there any idea what could have gone wrong and any  suggestions.

   don't we have a TAG for it so that poeple just post their opinions to

Any one one knows about a RSS reader which scrolls the latest news in a
panel (GNOME/KDE)? I don't find any such RSS reader for linux distro. I
don't want to run a application window for that.

I think someone mentioned a few days back that this month's Digit DVD 
contains the ISO for Gentoo 2006.0. Can someone confirm this?

Yes. C-DAC's Param Padma is also powered by GNU/Linux, but since this 
discussion was about the Top 10 supercomputers (based on the Top 500 
listing), I listed out only the Linux-powered supercomputers from the top 
10.

Thanks,

That's right. And this works only for smtp servers, because the DNS
specifications have special hooks for them (a special MX record, with
priorities associated with each record). It wouldn't work for your
POP/HTTP or any other type of server.

Even then, I'm of the opinion that secondary MX records are practically useless.

That adds up to 7 hours. Or in other words, 99.92% uptime. Most
Internet-based businesses will laugh me out of their offices if I as
an ISP went to them promising only 99.92% uptime.

The fact remains that it works only for the SMTP protocol, and nothing
else. So you really don't achieve anything - your users still go
without emails for the duration of your downtime.

When speaking about the applications of Linux and Open Source, the first 
point generally put out is "Servers" and "Super-Computers". Going 
through the list of world's top super computers proves this a lot.

Starting with IBM's Blue Gene, which is said to be capable of performing 
200 trillion calculations per second, Linux has been chosen as the best 
option. The reason that researchers at IBM point out for such a decision 
is the vast and strong Open Source Community. Their main idea was to get 
the feedbacks and inputs from the OS community, so that they can improve 
thier existing facilities. Its great to hear that IBM has started 
preferring Linux rather than its own Unix OS version,AIX. ( Reference: 
http://news.com.com/2100-1001-963285.html)

ASC Purple is another mighty product from the IBM, which is proposed to 
be used for Nuclear Weapon Simulations, employs linux to keep it up and 
running. This is a very good example for Linux being used in such 
mission critical applications. And, why leave IBM MareNostrum. IBM has 
been creating more powerful computing machines and employing Linux in 
them. This is something which should make every Linuxian to feel proud 
enough :)

The list continues, with Dell's Thunderbird ( though I didn't get many 
leads on this one). When trying to get info about NEC Earthlink 
Simulator I got this,

"Clusters, often using Linux running on computers with Intel or AMD 
processors, don't run some jobs as efficiently as more monolithic 
designs. But they work well enough at a low enough price that major 
customers are snapping them up."
(Reference: 
http://news.com.com/IBM+regains+supercomputer+bragging+rights/2100-1008_3-5239777.html)

This has been the prime reason that the super computer creators has been 
sticking with Linux. But, doing more googling for sumpercomputers and 
linux took me to this page : 
http://news.com.com/IBM+regains+supercomputer+bragging+rights/2100-1008_3-5239777.html, 
where its been said that almost 60% of the super computers are running Linux

"Linux now has become so technically powerful that it lays claim to a 
prestigious title--it runs more of the world's top supercomputers than 
any other operating system. "

Mark Seager, assistant department head for advanced technologies at the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Calif., is quoted 
to have said, "The lab chose Linux partly because it is "open source," 
meaning users can change the code to suit their needs. ".

So, there are three main things conforming to the application of Linux 
in Super Computers - cost factor, community and the open source nature :)

There are a number of factors involved in choosing a o/s for a machine.

To my limited knowledge, that includes the application planned to be
deployed on the machine, the underlying processors and other hardware
components, the availability requirements of the application ( mission
critical-ness) the security requirements of the applications, the
compatibility requirements of the partners / contractors / users of the
application etc.



Majority of the super computers are developed and/ or deployed in Govt
Projects and  are funded / supported by Govt agencies.  International
Political currents and political needs are major influencing factors of the
specification of these projects and therefore the specification of the
underlying technologies.



One important factor pertaining to the o/s specification of a super
computer, is the requirement of the source code.



Most of the companies contracted for such projects already have ( or able to
have) their own o/s and source code. (in the grade of IBM, Sun etc). They
are all willing to give the o/s but not the source code.



But the project specifications must have insisted on giving the source code
of all the softwares used in that project. So the contracting companies are
crushed between the options of giving the source code of their proprietary
o/s or develop a new o/s specific for the project and give the source code
of that o/s.



Here OSS  becomes the third option. It saves the contracting companies from
giving away the  source code of their propriety o/s and also  saves a lot of
time in developing a fresh o/s since  oss comes with all the FREEdom to edit
it's code to meet the specific application's requirements. In this situation
OSS commercially is the perfect choice. In spite of the fact that , for such
large projects, money is not a big constrain. ( Bill gate$ might be watching
?..)



Amongst the OSS operating systems, on technical parameters , Open BSD and
Solaris might have scored well for the clean code, security and performance.
( possibly  open Solaris is developed based on these pressures..?)  But on
administrative parameters GNU/Linux might have scored well because of the
large no. of available applications, popularity ( & compatibility )   with
systems of contractors/ partners / associates and users, Easy availability
of trained man power etc.



This must be the reason why GNU/Linux is chosen for most of the latest super
computers.

1.Our mail servers are for our in house application and we are not in ISP
business.
2.The QoS commitments ( quality of service ) of Mail ISPs, which are in the
range of 99.99 and so on are only indications and are not enforcable since
they have no legal validity.
3. I follow the management principle KISS for designing and maintaining
technology based solutions.( Kiss - Keep it simple stupid)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_Principle
4.The difference between  99.99 and 99.92 is 0.07 % The probability of you
and me dying this year is 0.62 %. ( actuarial statistics of LIC of india for
a 30 year old male/female). When we are choosing to accept a failure rate of
0.62 for our life itself, why cant we accept a failure rate of 0.07 for our
mail servers..?
5. Don't look in to things only technical. Look around the world.

Hi,

 "Why is it that 8 of the world's top 10 supercomputers are powered by
GNU/Linux?"

there are lots of reasons to chose GNU/Linux for supercomputers, but
from some practical experience I've had let me list down a few.

One of the primary reasons, that I've seen is the fact that GNU/Linux
has more exposure than all other variants of unix around. It is
usually a great misconception that super-computers are used by
uber-geeks, sadly thats not true.

Most of the super-computers (the top 8 and the ones that I've worked
on) are run primarily by scientists with a considerable non-cs
background. And the last thing  they would want is to be put up in an
environment thats alien to them. Most of them however are used to
linux at some-level (all thanks to LaTeX). And they are comfortable
with linux. Since most projects are approved by scientists at
top-posts, putting Linux would increases the chances of getting a nod
for the contract rather than say OpenBSD or NetBSD. (chances are high
that most of these people haven't heard about that). Btw, I am not
bad-mouthing scientists here, they are just the smartest people
around, And its not really their line of work to care about
"technicalities" like OS issues.

Secondly, one thing that puts linux ahead of the other free nix's
around is the fact that there are many scientific-libraries that work
just like that on linux. Though most of them have been ported to most
other unixes, the "latest and greatest" version often comes out first
on linux.

Third reason, (though it doesn't necessarily pertain to the top-8
supercomputers, but to smaller ones that are regularly used in some
form of research or the other) is that sometimes, A bigger
super-computer is usually shared between a couple of labs, whereas,
these smaller labs often have their own 16-node compute cluster or
8-node compute cluster. And these clusters are invariably linux
(probably running debian or fedora). The reason there is its a lot
easier to install debian or fedora rather than say openbsd or freebsd
and these people would like to have a "home" environment when the ssh
into the super-computers node.

Other Things that doesn't directly relate to the topic at hand.

1. On Windows :
Many people are under the misconception that windows doesn't fit well
in the super-computing area. But strangely some "HP"
(high-performance) versions are on offer by microsoft. The problem
seems to be that the os chokes on handling extremely high bandwidth
lines, rather than any inherent instability in the os itself.
(weakest-link kinda logic i believe).

2. On Supercomputers
The top-8 mentioned above takes into consideration only
super-computers based on speed. But somehow, i feel its too narrow a
criterion. If you take into consideration like accessibility, storage
area clusters, web-servers (on server farms) etc.. I seriously doubt
wether we will see Linux dominating. (I guess OpenBSD/FreeBSD will
start winning). They are all super computers in their own-right, just
that they don't do massive number crunching in the conventional sense.

Vishnu Vyas.

Dear Karuppuswamy,
Happy to see your feedback. I havent tried the new version of Ubutu yet.
Here are my comments.
1. The tamil rendering was available in ubuntu's earlier version also
2. Even earlier also typing in tamil is possible.

But my frustration was due to the fact that there were no support for the
following popular tamil keyboards.
1. tamilnet99 keyboard
2. Anjal keyboard (Transliteration keyboard)
3. Tamil typewriter keyboard.

Please let me know if the above 3 popular standard keyboard support is
available in the new Ubuntu. If they are available. I would be the happiest
person :)

Regards,
Mugunth

In Debian, amongst the TSCII, Unicode and TAB tamil
keyboard layouts, I prefer to use TAB because it is
very close to the tamil typewriter layout. Only few
characters are interchanged.

I think it should be available in Ubuntu.

It is actually called an SLA, and is usually a legally binding contract.

Good question. You should ask the top management, board members,
shareholders and the likes of the big companies this question.

As far as I'm concerned, my company loses several hundred thousand
dollars every hour of downtime, hence I, as the responsible manager in
the IT department, either meet my SLA or prepare myself for an early
retirement. As simple as that.

Dear Sakthi,
TSCII, Unicode & TAB are all character encodings.
We are are talking about keyboard layouts.

The following are the standard keyboards used by Tamils:
1. Tamilnet99 keyboard. ( http://www.tamilvu.org/Tamilnet99/keystand.htm )

2. Anjal keyboard. ( There dont seem to exist an official Anjal keyboard
layout site. A layout of anjal keyboard can be found in this URL:
http://www.tamilanjal.com/mail/ta3.htm)

3. tamil typewriter keyboard (Similary here also there dont seem to exist an
official typewriter keyboard site. A layout of typewriter is found in this
site: http://www.tamilanjal.com/mail/ta2.htm )

Please note that using any of the above keyboard, users should be able to
type in any standard encoding(ie. using tamilnet99 keyboard, user should be
able to type in either Unicode encoding or TSCII or TAB encodings depending
software used for typing).

I am not commenting about the encoding.

So here my question is about the keyboard layout used for typing. When the
Linux distros dont give support to the keyboards that are already used by
the tamils, we cannot Tamil users to adopt linux for their needs.

Imagine a linux distro coming with a new proprietory keyboard for english
instead of the QWERTY keyboard thats being used for english now. I feel its
the same suitation exists in tamil distros related to tamil support.

Mugunth

    "Sorry, I scanned 1 interface, but the Access Concentrator of your

In Debian, I can use any of the keyboard layouts,
unicode/TSCII/TAB. In simple words, a keyboard layout
is a key-to-character mapping.

Maybe next time when we meet, I'll show you how one
can use it in Debian.

Yup. Post output of the following before you try to
dial: 

 /sbin/ifconfig -a
 /sbin/lsmod
 cat /etc/resolv.conf
 /sbin/route -n

Note, you can redirect output to a file:

 /sbin/lsmod > lsmod.txt

Details required. If GNU/Linux Based jobs check out the posts that come with
a [JOB] tag. If not this is not the right place to ask.
Kindly mark any "Out of Topic" post with a [OT] tag in the subject line.

Dear Sakthikannan,
I am afraid you dont understand the difference between encoding and keyboard
layout.

By the term encoding we mean character encoding. Check this url for meaning
of character encoding. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding

When we are talking about ascii/unicode/tscii/tab --> we are talking about
encoding NOT keyboards.
*** Note that encoding doesnt talk about how you type a characte in keyboard
***

Keyboard layout:
keyboard layout is how a user types tamil. -- Understand that keyboard
layouts are not character encoding. Also keyboard layouts are not related to
computers alone. *** Keyboard layouts existed in typewriters even before
computers are invented ***

When we talk about terms QWERTY, tamilnet99, Anjal, typewriter keyboard
layouts --> we are talking about keyboard layouts. How the keyboard is
physically present in the keyboard.

Also note that:
In computers using any keyboard layout, we can make the software print any
encoding.
for example we can use tamilnet99 keyboard layout to type tamil in either
TSCII/Unicode/Tab ... encodings.
(Check this downloads page for such softwares for windows:
http://thamizha.com/modules/mydownloads/viewcat.php?cid=3 )

So comparing character encoding with keyboard layouts is like comparing
apples with oranges.

So I hope you understand what I mean by keyboard layouts. With this contect,
please let us know what tamil keyboard layouts are supported in Ubuntu.
(Will a person trained in typewriter institute to type tamil able to type
tamil in the same way in Ubuntu)

Mugunth

Shakti: A keyboard layout is the way the keys are distributed on a
keyboard. The standard ones you see, QWERTY, is probably the most
popular one too (though I have seen some AZERTY/QWERTZ keyboards here
in Europe). Unicode or TSCII are NOT keyboard layouts.

Subject: [Ilugc] Mailserver configuration help
Message-ID: <002a01c66139$cc120140$140110ac@LOGUCO>

Hi,

We have a mail server at our california office and there are about 25% of 
mail users in California and the rest 75% are in india office. We get lot of 
large mails to some of the aliases. And since most users in the alias are in 
india and to avoid downloading of the same mail by them we have setup a 
mailserver in India office and forward a single mail to it and distribute it 
from there.

This becomes some what difficult to manage users and alias file on both 
mailservers. Is there a better way of doing this. Also is it possible to 
configure the mailserver at India in such a way that if a user from India 
sends mail to an alias, the mails to the users in India should be locally 
delivered and mail to the users in california should be delivered through 
mailserver at california. The mail id should be of same format to all users.

We have qmail + ldap at california and sendmail in India.

Your suggestions are welcome.

Thanks

Yes you can achive the same at both the ends.
         a. Qmail ( use the "mailforwardingaddress" in Qmail LDAP. )
         b. Sendmail ( use the complex user routing to set the rules: this
will be achieved by setting local user routing + remote user routing for
specific user you which the e-mail to be routed. )

probably OT but how would you categorise input methods then? as a
keyboard layout? I am referring to phonetic translation schemes like SCIM.

I am on dapper. Keyboard preferences let me add layouts for "Tamil",
"Tamil TAB Typewriter", "Tamil TSCII Typewriter", "Tamil Unicode".

I hope that helps. But from what you said, Unicode shouldn't figure in
that list should it? Its after all an encoding standard not a layout.

My take is a little cynical one on why big companies use Linux and not
Windows or OSX or *NIX.

> This month we've decided to start with the topic, "Why is it that 8 of the
> world's top 10 supercomputers are powered by GNU/Linux?"

There are many _business_reasons_ why people opt for Linux on
Supercomputers rather than a proprietary operating system.

First, Consider how a supercomputer is constructed.Take the case of
IBM's "Blue Gene" the No.1 among the top 10 list of supercomputers.
Blue Gene is not a "computer" per se. It's a computer architecture
specification. More details on Wikipedia. The Blue Gene architecture
basically refers to how a "compute node" is architectured in the
complete supercomputer. The supercomputer is complete when many such
compute nodes are put together to operate as a single coherent unit.

Each compute node has one or more CPU's on it.When you go in for a
proprietary Operating System(say Windows) the licensing is usually
done "per cpu".When you go out to build a supercomputer with say a 100
compute nodes on it ,it means you will need to purchase 100 licenses
of a proprietary OS for the 100 CPU's and in Blue Gene's case its 100
X 2 as it's a SMP based system.

If you take the CU-11 system[1] based on Blue Gene architecture which
comes with 65536 nodes it really makes no sense to run Windows Server
2003 on it and incur unnecessary OS costs.Linux is commercially free
and there is no per-cpu licensing cost so it really makes business
sense on choosing Linux than Windows or any other proprietary version
of UNIX.

That's the cost part of running Linux, now a few technical advantages.
* Linux has the best SMP support among the free *NIX's.It's much
better than the *BSD's hence the reason why "Big-Iron" computer makers
prefer Linux.Solaris supposedly has better SMP support on Sparc.

* Customizing the linux kernel is easy considering the amount of
available kernel engineers in the FOSS world.Also the linux kernel
allows the linking of proprietary binaries to it which means the
modifications(IP) done by IBM for it's special hardware can still be
retained.

* Threading model: the 2.6 version of the linux kernel has a very
optimized threading model for parallel computation.The 1:1 threading
model of 2.6 with increased support for more more number of processes
and the use of the NTPL threadinf model really gives Linux the edge.

* NUMA: (Non-Uniform Memory Access) Another killer feature required
for Grid based systems made it's way into the 2.6 kernel.Learn more
about NUMA from Wikipedia[2]

How does FOSS Benefit from Supercomputers running Linux ?

* Companies like SGI and IBM contribute back code which they consider
will be important for them.It's purely business.
- IBM has a huge team working on I/O Subsystem's.Guess where I/O plays
a HUGE part ? Supercomputers..
- SGI gives back XFS code under the GPL. Guess what SGI Supercomputers
use as their filesystem ?
- Support for Infiniband made it to the Linux kernel at a blazing
speed.Guess what is used as the netrworking interconnect between
compute nodes.

* Remmember that the user-space software of the supercomputer is *NOT*
FOSS or is no way connected with free software.Who would want
protien-folding capabilities in the linux kernel ? This User-space
software is what is of prime importance in a supercomputer.In the case
of supercomputing this is usually math-crunching libraries and other
special libraries which are required for a specific
task(protien-folding).The user-space s/w is usually interlinked with
non-GPL free software like MPI(http://open-mpi.org) or mpich.  Non-GPL
(BSD based) implementations are available which can be used for
commercial purposes.In fact MS Server 200X(whatever) will be shipping
with the mpich libraries(C++ bindings for MPI).  To make Microsoft
ship it's first open-source package is really remarkable,this proves
how superior the free supercomputing libraries are.These libraries
usually come with shared memory management(ROMIO) and networking
libraries which can be customized to one's needs.

On the whole the Supercomputer-Linux relationship is a purely Business
one.FOSS contribution is just a side effect.

Subject: [Ilugc] CD burning on command prompt
Message-ID: <44432A60.1030609@midascomm.com>

Hi,
I am burning a CD on RedHat linux 7.2 using mkisofs and cdrecord in 
multi session mode.
Every next time cd burning consumes some additional disk space( around 
16-17 MB).
But when i try to see the CD used space, it returns only files size 
which are written onto it.
More Over, if i have written an updated file(same name) which is already 
written onto CD, it counts only new file size.

Is there any way to find out the exact CD burnt space?

I did one experiment:
made a loop and wrote 500KB file onto a blank CD.
Loop successfully executed 48 times and there after stopped as CD was full.
When i checked CD size, it displayed 500KB.

One More Query:
How can we read the CD label on Linux?
I have used -V option in mkisofs to give CD label. I am able to see this 
label on Windows but not in Linux as it displays /mnt/cdrom.
Any command/configuration?

Best Regards,
Deepak Dikshit

Message-ID: <loom.20060417T071453-756@post.gmane.org>

ok, we have had some discussions, let me add my views / facts.

8 of top 10 of the top500 supercomputers TODAY are linux based. was not like
this historically. if you go back, say 5 years (yeah, some of us have been
interested in top 500 for that long, heck, maybe even longer), vendor flavours
of unix was king. ibm, sgi etc were big players, so aix, irix and such figured
prominently. the sponsors then were the same government laboratories and there
was no issue with source code. users were quite happy (well, maybe, maybe not)
with vendor supplied non-open-source os machines as long as the parallel tools
ran as per user expectations. it was common for vendors to tweak their
networking code and parallel tool (mpi) code, but as hardware and network
architechture kept changing, this was more and more tricky. also, specialty
networking like myrinet and infiniband added its own twist to this tale. sorry,
but i believe that the shift to linux is not for any real 'technical merit'
reason but just incidental. high performance users dont really want to see the
networking source code - they want to use parallel tools like mpi and want their
code to run FAST. in any case, the top500 listing is based on linpack benchmark
using mpi (only), so parallel performance using mpi is all that counts.

there was also some comment about param padma. param padma is an ibm p-series
(risc) smp box based machine - basically ibm supplied hardware with some cdac
special networking. the previous param 10000 was a similar construct with sun
hardware. cdac's contribution in both cases was in special networking. the
'real' indian entry into the top 500 (no longer current) was from imsc
(matscience) with its xeon linux cluster. of course, now we have more entries,
including the centre for biochemical technology delhi (i guess institute of
genomics blah blah is the correct name).

Message-ID: <20060417062044.13805.qmail@web36813.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear ilugc members,

I am looking for someone who has done tamil translations of opensource projects before to work on a Tamil translation of Drupal (www.drupal.org), a power, opensource content management framework.

I am only a freelancer working on sites for nonprofits in a small way, so this is a project with minimal funding (but terrific potential), although I am willing to invest some personal savings into this. Please send me a personal message indicating interest in this assignment and experience in similar projects and we can discuss the rest. There are already a couple of efforts in place, so you will not be starting from scratch.

Needless to say, the translation will be contributed back to the Drupal community under GPL. Drupal itself is GPLed code, as many of you may know.

Regards,
Venkat

P.S: Since this is an open-source assignment, I have not prefixed the subject line with 'Commercial'. Hope I am right.

Yes. I agree.  I meant better  rendering in firefox  (kokki characters are
displayed properly). Typing was also available (tamil-gtk2im), but now with
better SCIM input frame work.

But my frustration was due to the fact that there were no support for the

1. tamil99 keyboard is available through tamil-gtk2im package (I don't that
layout, but I am able to type tamil characters). Both TSCII and Unicode are
supported.
2. tamilvp (Tamil Visai Palagai with both TSCII and Unicode) also available
and working. But I don't know whether it is Tamil typewriter layout or
something else.
3. Anjal keyboad is very much available through scim framework. It is
working good and available with simple user interface such applet based
language switcher.

Good. Before implementing the solution, you should also think about
the following points.

1. How Confidential is the data? You should have the same data access
policy for the backups that you have for the actual data.
2. Assuring the Integrity of the data, by recording MD5/SHA1 checksums.
3. Availability of the data - if the master copy of the data crashes,
how much downtime can you suffer? Do you need the backup to be
restored within minutes or hours or days?

The above three together are sometimes known as the CIA principle (and
are not restricted just to backups). Apart from these,

1. Retention period. You cannot keep old data forever - storage,
outside of google, is not infinite. You need to draw a line somewhere
and decide that you wouldn't store data older than so many days.
2. Offsite backups - do you need those? What if a fire destroys both
your production and backup copy?
3. How often do you need full backups and how often do you need
incremental backups?

What is the QOS commitment you give on you sla.
And what was the your qos achievement last year.

Any way to put an end to this :
No mail is missed and a few hours of delay in whole year :- is a good enough

budgetary limitations.
That may not be acceptable / appealing for companies in ISP business

I understand. My experience with clients abroad are also the same.
While i personally  would not want to agree to most of their paranoid

While designing / architectureing a system/network / program or a project ,
be conscious on the fact that the external factors can also determine the
success or failure of the project. I have experienced this. You can also see
many technically well designed systems not successful because of external
factors, while technically unsound things becoming super hit. ( simple
example linux & win)

 You can go for the Qmail at your India Office or make sendmail to use LDAP.
Manage the accounts centrally via LDAP.  This will reduce your job is
configuring your alias settings.

For ex, your LDAP alias may contain:

ou=alias1,dc=yourcompany,dc=com
alias1 <alias1@yourcompany.com>: user1, user2, user3,
alias1_in@india.yourcompany.com

Once this is set, this will forward your mails to your india mail
server(Which is configured to use LDAP)

Create another alias in the same LDAP with:
ou=alias1_in,dc=yourcompany,dc=com
alias1_in <alias1_in@india.yourcompany.com>: user4, user5,user6

This will forward mails to your india.yourcompany.com users

Hope this solves your difficulty in managing the accounts.

But still you need to think it of for sending the mails locally when the
mail is sent to alias from India...

Yep, we are both saying the same thing.

The availability expectation v/s cost of implementation graph tends to
have an asymptote at 100% availability. It costs 0 to implement a
system which is never online :-) but infinite to implement one that is
online all the time. So one should make trade-offs and decide on the
kind of availability one needs (which would tell one how much money
one should spend) . If one is running a multimillion dollar mission
critical appserver farm, it pays to spend several grand on having a
99.999% availability system, but it might not be worthwhile doing that
for a company intranet webserver.

Binand

PS: Figuring out where, on the availability spectrum, does the email
system with the blackberry server that top management uses, reside is
left as an exercise to the reader.

But still this nagged me,
I used lilo because dual booting with windows and i did the right setting, u

This worked on all the distros i tried
But on gentoo, it did not, i could find only gentoo in the bootloader

Then when i logged into gentoo, i found that internet could not be accessed

Again i tried reading the handbook and yet even after doing everything
there, it said eth0 not found, but realtek eth chipset which i use  worked

So i was forced to reinstall Ubuntu, not that i dont like it but that i want

Any help would be appreciated
Also i could do quite a lot if somebody could help me with xorgconfig

I use a Samsung Syncmaster 773s, 17 inch monitor, i do not know my video

Also it would be nice if somebody with a similar config gave me stepwise

Use grub instead. Lilo is, well not depreceated, but less useful. Grub's light 
years ahead.

Did you compile it into the kernel? As a module? Is the module loaded at boot?

Use X -configure instead. It'll drop an xorg.conf in your home dir. Edit that 
later to suit your preferences, but it'll usually be enough to work on.

"X -configure" doesn't work out of the box in all cases, at least it
didn't work for my eMac with ATI Radeon 9200.

Keeping the manual that came with monitor is handy at times.  Also
read the appropriate X display driver manual.  It helps.

BTW you could try Xautoconfig.

True, but he seems to be using an i865, which is a more forgiving chipset...

And X -configure is a useful first step - if it works, you get out the easy 
way, and if it doesn't, you do something else... :-)

At this instant, it didn't strike you to send a query
to ilugc?

> So i was forced to reinstall Ubuntu, 

Its called "running away from the problem". You would
have learnt something if you did do some
troubleshooting at this instant :) 

Next time when you get stuck with Internet
configuration, note the output of the following
commands:

 /sbin/lsmod
 /sbin/ifconfig -a
 /sbin/route -n
 cat /etc/resolv.conf

Note, you can redirect output to a file:

 /sbin/lsmod > lsmod.txt

> like it but that i want

Sure. 

When you go through a learning curve, you will hit
road bumps. Its natural. But, only when you persevere
you will see light at the end of the tunnel.

You can use "xorgcfg" which will open a graphical
display for configuring your X settings.

Subject: [Ilugc] Simple Block Driver (RAM DISK) - Console Crash (specific
	case)
Message-ID: <3AEC1E10243A314391FE9C01CD65429B3FCDCC@mail.esn.co.in>

Dear All,

I developed a simple ram disk driver. It is working fine. 

But I am facing a new problem (console crash) when I try to run the "ls"
command on a mount point after removing the disk with out unmounting
(see the below - How I am removing the ram disk after mount without
unmounting).

Please find the attached source. I am using the following configuration.
--> x86 system with Fedora Core 3 installed (IA-32 Architecture)
--> Running 2.6.x kernels like 2.6.10, 2.6.12 and 2.6.14 on the same
system.

To reproduce the "console crash error" you just have to follow exactly
the next steps:

1) Copy the attached files to your system 
2) Build the sbd.ko file using the attached Makefile (make)
3) Load (insert) the module into the kernel space (insmod sbd.ko)
4) wait a few milli seconds to create the device node and format the
device (mke2fs /dev/sbd0)
5) mount the device (mount /dev/sbd0 /mnt)
6) copy some files into the mount point (cp *.c /mnt)
7) un mount the device (umount /mnt OR umount /dev/sbd0)
8) then again, mount the device (mount /dev/sbd0 /mnt)
9) remove the mounted device (compile the app.c file [cc app.c] then run
the ./a.out which will remove the mounted device) You can easily
understand by seeing the code.
10) cd /mnt
11) run ls (which shows the errors messages - see attachment mes_log
file)
12) run again ls - console crash 

SEE THE BELOW TWO CONDITIONS WHERE I AM NOT ABLE TO SEE THE CONSOLE
CRASH.

1)	After mounting the FDD, I removed the floppy with out un
mounting (The floppy disk has already some files in it).
2)	If I perform the above procedure WITH OUT STEPS 6, 7 and 8.

Could any one explain why the problem occurs?
If I am wrong please correct me.

Thanks in very advance.

Thanks and Regards,
Srinivas G

In some remote cases "xorgcfg" doesn't work, in which case you can use
"xorgcfg -textmode".

You should never do this. Always unmount the disk
before removing it:

1. If there is caching of disk write data, then
removing the disk without unmounting it will not cause
the data to be flushed. So, data integrity is not
assured.

2. Driver data will be in an unknown state if not
cleaned up properly.

Argh! Don't send attachments to e-mails sent to

Don't worry about the monitor, but the i865g works off the i810 driver and 
chipset, which in turn means that it should work with xorg without too much 
trouble.

Just remember to enable it in the kernel: Enable Device Drivers->Character 
Devices->/dev/agpgart and the Intel 440LX/BX/GX, I8XX and E7x05 chipset 
support under agpgart. Also, Direct rendering manager in the same page and 
the Intel cards below that (unless Xorg still comes with its own DRI - 
someone else will correct me on this, I hope). I'd suggest that you compile 
these into the kernel instead of mucking around with modules. You're never 
really likely to need to remove your display driver during runtime! :-)

I understand it removing a mounted device will lead to inconsistent
data. But, in case of a removable media this may happen. Right?

I am trying to simulate a REMOVABLE MEDIA (FLASH MEDIA) driver
environment. This is an attempt to understand what to handle on surprise
removal of a mounted Flash Media disk.

I am not writing any data to the disk after mounting the device before
removing it with out unmounting the device. If I write any data to the
device then I should COMPULSARY unmount the device.

I have written a small how-to in enabling boot-splash in Yoper Wiki. Here is
the link...

http://www.yoper.com/wiki/index.php?title=Developers:BootSplash_Configuration

and also this link (which is there in wiki) helped  me a lot to enable the
progressbar..

Well, you need to know how your init scripts work and modify the bootsplash
code for progressbar as mentioned here
http://www.mail-archive.com/hints@linuxfromscratch.org/msg00068.html in the
initscript.

Interesting points.  I would like to add that rsnapshot and rdiff-backup
(pretty easy to find on google) are excellent candidates for continuous
incremental snapshot backups.  Storing the last 14 days of daily
snapshots is easy peacy and requires surprisingly little disk space
(ofcourse, it also depends on how active your file systems are).

We use rdiff-backup to snapshot ~3TB of data and it works great.
rdiff-backup is highly recommended.

Both systems work only on HDDs and not on tapes.

Dear friends: I had received the following query from a Chennai company

One of my colleagues has suggested Quanta which is part of KDE.

I would appreciate if any of you could throw more light. [Of course, I too

Thanks and best wishes, Srinivasan

QUOTE Dear Dr. Srinivasan,

You know that we want to shift to Linux, we are developing softwares . For
this we need text editors, tools for creating tables. On window platform we
are using Macromedia Dreamweaver which creates tables and also edits php
codes and creats database in MySql. For developing softwares in  Linux we
need editor and tool equal to Dreamweaver.

So far we are not able to get anything - any tool. Is there any tool which
can perform the functions of Dreamweaver in linux which is compactable to
PHP, MySql.

We tried NVU, which does not work with PHP but with only HTML. Therefore not
able to write PHP code on NVU and store in  MySql.Though NVU has all
the good features of Dreamweaver it has no use for Linux .

Please let us know an appropriate tool which can be used for developing
softwares on Linux.

nope - bluefish, quanta, screem, nvu are all aids which assume that the
user is a professional competent in html, css, javascript, databases etc
etc - dreamweaver assumes that the user knows little or nothing of these
things. Migrating the average 'web programmer/designer' from dreaweaver 
to any of these tools is an excercise in futility - the only way a person
would migrate would be if he had to pay personally for his copy of
dreamweaver ;-)

Lets be realistic - there are some things that foss still cannot do. As i
mentioned in another mail on this thread - we are very very far from
developing anything like corel draw.

Hi Shakti,

I am a member of ilugc.
Yesterday i sent my first mail to grp , But i received

I bought a new HP Pavilion PC . It has only 2

I want to make some more partitions and even i want to

in the future while recovering if some problem comes.
So i want to make partitions by myself .
Is there any linux distro available which boots from

This might be slightly OT for this thread but(anyway) I found Active
Grid's[1] AppBuilder[2] a very versatile software package for
developing web applications.Best thing is, it's cross-platform and
100% suited for LAMP development.

Though it's not a Dreamweaver-killer it seems to be a
jack-of-all-trades when it comes to LAMP development(ships with
webserver and MySQL integrated with the IDE) and provides a end-to-end
solution.Feedback at my workplace was very positive with LAMP
dev-newbies.Also it works on Linux,Windows and Mac.

Disclaimer:
I don't work for Active Grid. :-)

 I had the same problem when I wanted to install Debian on my Dell Inspiron laptop. I used GParted LiveCD to partition the C drive. I shrinked the size of C drive using GParted and then installed Debian in my laptop. You can get teh gparted livecd here

Message-ID: <20060418164843.47890.qmail@web50214.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

Firstly, thanks to all for the clarification between
keyboard layout and character encoding. 

I would like to know your views/preference for Tamil
character encodings: TAB, TSCII, Unicode, any other. I
am using QWERTY keyboard on Debian Sarge 3.1r0a.

I am able to input tamil characters on the
terminal/browser/abiword if I set character encoding
to Unicode. TAB only works with abiword.

But, the catch with unicode is that letters that get
tagged with "oo" or "ooo" are represented in a very
different manner compared to what we use in writing.
Is this acceptable?

This illustration gives the notation used:
http://members.tripod.com/~peacecraft/infomining/tamiluni.htm

Examples: &#2991;&#3009; &#2991;&#3010; 
          &#2965;&#3009; &#2965;&#3010;

The correct representation is provided in TAB
encoding. 

Any thoughts?

SK

I guess that is not a problem with no hardware related and is not while

I don't claim expertise on this topic, but my understanding is that
Unicode doesn't actually specify how different glyphs should be
rendered on screen. Unicode abstracts each written unit - letters,
your oo/ooo, numerals, punctuation marks etc. - and leaves the actual
rendering of these units to the application used.

It is noting to do with booting.

> in a crash.


appreciate your concern.

If you will see the call trace: It usually happens in atomic() state, and on
top of it when irq() is disable().. i.e. 1. and as irq() is not reentrant...
so it make your system hangs.

Namely, when "noapic" option is passed symmetric io mode is not entered and
all IRQs appear as "XT-PIC" in /proc/interrupts.

one tip from my experience in speaking at the chennai lug: the linux 
machine was not working, so I borrowed a laptop from the audience - 
dont even know what operating system was on it. My slides were in 
S5 format (html+css) which will run on any operating system 
whatsoever as long as it has a browser

Had some hands on the tools which i mentioned.

1) Amanda

I didnt try this tool becoz the docs said that it is for tape drives. I am
still not clear whether it is for tape drives or also can take backups in
normal hard disks.

2) Mondo

This tool was excellent. I had got feedback that the earlier verisions had
some problem, but the current stable version is kewl. It takes a backup of
the source as a compressed iso and puts it in any medium you specify. Here
too, am not sure whether Monda can do incremental backups every day or hour.

3) Konserve
>

This is a very small tool. It can be used in home to backup few files. In an
Office or Enterprise Environment, i dont think ths will be useful.

I would be happy to get feedback on Amada and Monda usage, if people are
using it for their backups.

Thank you.

Will get back as i progress.

Message-ID: <c293dd340604200744p6be532a7lb2778a31d049d241@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We at InfyLUG, the Infosys[1] Linux User Group have been working on a
Firefox extension called LiveURLs [2] which lets users create links to
specific content on web pages. The concept is based on a technical
whitepaper[3] on web technologies published by InfyLUG and which will
be presented as a poster[4] at the 15th World Wide Web Conference[5]
in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Some benefits of LiveURL's:
    * Sharing selected content on web pages is just a right click away.
    * Peer - Peer Sharing - no centralized entity required.
    * Usable in the same manner as existing URLs.
    * Browsers which do not support LiveURLs still show the whole page.

The code and technology[6] is still in a POC stage with the
implementation-standard details not finalized.  The source code,
licensed under the GPL, can be picked up from CVS [7].  We welcome
suggestions, brickbats, praise and most importantly bug reports [8]. 
Please join the liveurls mailing list [9] for discussion on further
development of this extension.

We hope to garner support for this concept and to see it as a default
feature in all browsers.

Please suggest me the following:

1. Which Make (Acer or Toshiba or HP)
2. Model No

Looking forward to hear from you friends.

I have Comapaq Presario 2203 AL - Intel Centrino Processor. I have many
distributions like RedHat,Fedora,Madriva,Mandrake,Yoper,Ubuntu,PCLinuxOS and
still more.

This particular model was a Linux model and came with Mandrake. There are
few Linux models in Compaq Presario. You can very well check with any
dealers for the model.

F.U.D.  All x86 CPUs are very well supported in Linux.

EU is typically not that much cheaper than India.  Laptops are
significantly cheaper in the USA and Singapore.

A laptop is more than just the CPU, RAM, HDD and other specs. 
Ergonomics plays a huge role in deciding on a laptop.  I suggest that
you purchase the IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad laptops.  Nothing comes close to
Thinkpads on usability, rugged construction and ergonomics.  Ive known
Thinkpads to last 5 years without problems.

I own a Dell Latitude, but had to replace the keyboard (keys went soft
and unresponsive), lcd panel hinges broke (and cracked the
motherboard), and the battery had to be replaced.  All within 1 year
of use.  I dont recommend Dell laptops.  Ive reviewed several Acer,
Toshiba and HP/Compaq models, and am thoroughly unimpressed.

A lower end Thinkpad R51 costs some Rs 38,000 and includes a Celeron
CPU, 512MB RAM, 40GB HDD, DVD/CDRW, 14.1" LCD, WiLAN, etc. and no
software.  The machine is also fairly light weight and portable.

If you can afford it, go for the lighter Thinkpad T series.

On the other hand, if you purchase the laptop in the UK and export it
overseas within 15 days of purchase, you are eligible for a VAT
refund. The VAT in the UK is 17.5% and the refund on a laptop costing
?600 can be significant.

Check out www.dixons.co.uk and www.argos.co.uk to sample the kind of
prices and models available on the UK high street. Also, look at
individual vendors' websites for their offerings too.

Well said. In my professional career, I have used laptops from (the
erstwhile) Compaq, Sony, Dell and IBM/Lenovo - nothing even remotely
comes close to the Thinkpads in terms of usability and ergonomics.
Windows users can possibly be flustered by the lack of the hot key,
but the laptops more than compensate for that with Access IBM and all
the other features IBM provides. I am now on a T43 which is simply
fantastic.

> If you can afford it, go for the lighter Thinkpad T series.

The T43p is the latest, lightest and greatest.

Forgot to mention that:

1. If your friend is coming to India with TWO laptops (one of his own)
- you will have to pay customs duty in India. Unless there is a person
in your friend's party without a laptop, you will end up paying 200%
or something duty (or a hefty bribe).

2. Laptops (and PCs) sold in the UK will have en-GB as the
default/only locale and more importantly, the UK keyboard layout. This
keyboard layout has significant differences from the US layout which
you see in India, though one can adjust to it easily. For example, the
@, #, | and ~ keys (all important to the Linux user) are NOT where you
expect to find them.

+1 for Thinkpads. I have an R51 (couldn't afford the T series - someday, 
hopefully) and all I can say is good things about it. It survived some 
very bumpy rides on a bus to and fro my hometown. R series is a bit 
bulky, though. Don't expect to use it as a travel laptop - you have to 
go for a T43p as Binand recommends.

Intel does free/open source software development. They
have their own "Open Source Technology Center".

> My budget is around 50k. 

I don't like the designs of Compaq/HP, they have a
curly keyboard design.

Will not recommend Dell because their keyboards are
useless after one year.

Yes, definitely the IBM Thinkpads. Not sure how Lenovo
are these days.

Is this from Lenovo or was it bought earlier from IBM?

Thinkpads have a very handy feature for the frequent traveller, called
IBM Active Protection System. It protects the HDD from shocks and
vibrations. From the manual:

<quote>
The IBM(R) Active Protection System protects your hard disk drive when
the shock sensor inside your ThinkPad(R) computer detects a condition
that could damage the drive, such as system tilt, excessive vibration,
or shock. The hard disk drive is less vulnerable to damage when it is
not operating; so the system stops it from spinning, and may also move
the read/write heads of the drive to areas that do not contain data.
As soon as the shock sensor senses that the environment is stable
again (minimal change in system tilt, vibration, or shock), it turns
the hard disk drive on.

Wait... my laptop is a T43 - the integrated fingerprint reader is a
required feature at my company. The T43p is the one that is latest and
greatest.

In any case, I believe T41p is the last from IBM, T42 onwards are all
from Lenovo.

Hi,

I recently bought an IBM THINKPAD R51 2887 MQ6 Laptop. I did some googling
for Linux compatibility of laptops. I found that thinkpads are famous among
the linux community.

I didn't intend to upgrade in near future. So i wanted a model with
          512 MB RAM
         DVD Writer
         80 GB Harddisk
         Centrino processor

Thinkpad R51 is the one model that has all these features(almost) and within
my price range.

But i had to make some compromises.

Thinkpad R51 features
         512 MB RAM is DDR (not DDR2)
         DVD writer
         60 GB HD (instead of 80GB i wanted)
         1.7 GHZ Centrino processor
          No pre-installed OS ( no problem here)

Cons :

     No Windows key
     No wide screen
     You cannot increse the volume more than certain extent. (of course you
can attach an external speaker or headphone)

     I have bought this for 56,500 in chennai. If my budget is slightly
higher i would have gone for higher end models in thinkpad but nothing else.

Other laptops

       Featurewise i am impressed by Hp pavillion laptops though i don't
have any hands on experience on them.

        A recent model in lenova has all the above features but no DVD
writer. It has a built in camera.

PS :

         I have installed Fedora Core 4 and it is working fine. And waiting
for Fedora Core 5 DVD.

Best of luck,

Regars,
M.Ilamparithi

The process is not as simple as it sounds.  You cannot waiver the VAT
at the store itself, i.e. no duty free shopping available in stores. 
You must pay the full price at the store and claim the VAT back later.
 The VAT counter at Heathrow never opened its doors on time (for me
atleast), and I never managed to get a VAT refund.  There is the
option of filling up some forms and doing the entire process through
the post, but thats an entirely different can of worms.

Large retalier stores in the USA www.cdw.com, www.newegg.com, offer
great deals and rebates.  Its much easier to find/compare laptops on
the cdw.com website than ibm.com itself!  However, the lower end
models are simply not listed in their catalogs.  The savings are big
only if you are looking for higher end machines like the T or X series
Thinkpads.

IMO, the best place to purchase a lower end R series Thinkpad is India.

I have always utilized the services of Travelex, which has offices at
all major egress points of the UK (big ones like
Heathrow/Gatwick/Manchester have multiple, there's one even in
Waterloo Intl, I think).

Your comment about Heathrow is well taken; in my personal experience
it is no better than Chennai Central :)

  The VAT counter at Heathrow never opened its doors on time (for me

 option of filling up some forms and doing the entire process through

   Does the same customs problem hold true in the case of getting it from
   Singapore ?? I plan to get one from Singapore through my cousin. Can't she
   get more than one from there as shes planning to get one for her ? My
   friend said IBM Thinkpad T series some latest stuff costs 1800 Sing$. And
   he also said tht the avg salary @ singapore is 2000$. So, for them its
   quite normal rate to get a laptop. That comes around 47K if we do a direct
   conversion. :) Think, the same laptop in india would costs around 60k -
   80k ?!

The import duty is imposed by India. The rule is that one laptop per
passenger for personal use can be imported without any paperwork or
payment, but anything more than that needs to be cleared via customs
after paying the necessary duty which I think for electronic goods is
150 or 200% (we are assuming that a laptop will not fit in the
duty-free limit of Rs. 25,000).

As I said, if your friend is flying into Mumbai or Hyderabad (or any
of the Kerala airports), she could pay bribes far less than that and
bring the laptop in, but my personal opinion is that customs officers
at Chennai are generally a honest lot.

What do you know? Our customs department has a website :)

This one is illuminating:

http://www.cbec.gov.in/cae/customs/cs-act/notifications/notfns-2k4/cs11-2k4.htm

And hence, my numbers change to (http://www.cbec.gov.in/cae/trvlers-info.htm )

"The goods over and above the free allowances shall be chargeable to
customs duty @ 40% + an education cess of 2% i.e. to say the effective
rate is 40.8%."

So if the customs guys get hold of it, your 50k laptop becomes a 70k one.

Did you try reading the CD size in M$ Window$, then see this:
http://aumha.org/win5/a/xpcd.php
Quoting from the link:
<Quote>
Explorer Properties shows the CD as the wrong size.

There appears to be a bug in Windows Explorer, such that when you put
in a disk that contains multiple ISO Sessions, Properties shows the
size of the files in the last session only, which may be very
misleading. This applies to multi-session disks burned with third
party software, as well as the native Win XP system.

Hi,

The European-Union funded FLOSSWorld project aims to enhance the level
of global awareness related to FLOSS among various sectors like
industry, academia, government, etc. As a part of this project, we
plan to conduct a series of surveys related to FLOSS, to understand
the impact and usage of FLOSS among developers, employers, government
officials and educational institutions across India.Please refer to
www.flossworld.org for more details about the FLOSSWorld project.

We are in the process of collecting contacts in order to circulate the
survey questionnaires. We have collected a number of contact addresses
from the internet and from references obtained from our regional
workshop participants.Give your experience in FOSS related
activities.We seek your help in reaching out to as many as people as
possible.Could you please mail back any contacts you know of among the
developer, e-government, academia and employer community, to whom, you
think, we can send the survey questionnaires. Also, let us know if you
would like to partiicpate in the survey.

Thanks and Regards,
FLOSSWorld team, C-DAC Mumbai

Subject: [Ilugc] Problem in installing package in FC-5
Message-ID: <5ef2113c0604222141g495c2a2v5df48f867218d9ce@mail.gmail.com>

I have installed Fedora Core 5 in my machine. I have problems in
installing new packages. There is a something called Application and
software install in the applications menu in Gnome desktop, but when I
try to run it as root it gives the error: Unable to get package list
and the application closes.
I tried to put
$yum list
but this also gives the following error,
core package not found.
How to solve this problem. I did the installation using FC5 cds. Is
there any post installation procedure that we have to do in order to
update the package list in fedora, like what we do in debian. Is there
any other utilities in fedora to install new software packages like
dselect, apt-get, aptitude, etc as in debian.

Subject: [Ilugc] Unable to download debian DVD ISO
Message-ID: <5ef2113c0604222134i1f731b01ye3d10784b788762a@mail.gmail.com>

Yesterday I was trying to download debian 3.1r2 DVD iso image from
cdimage.debian.org using wget, but unfortunately I was able to get
only 307MB of the image and the wget log showed me 100% completed. I
have a 2Mbps shared connection in the college. I ll get an average of
about 800Kbps during night time. I ve downloaded the 14 cd iso images
of r0, r1 etc of the debian, fc3,4,5 previously but everything was
going fine. But instead of getting a 4.7GB huge file I got only a
307Mb file. What could be the reason? Below I ve given a part on my
wget-log. I would like to know whether we cannot download such huge
files using wget? If not how to download using some other tool other
than jigdo or bittorrent. I heard we can put an rsync, but will it
work for http site? Also in one of the mirror site I found that it is
impossible to download such huge files using ftp, Is it true?

These kind of things depend upon both the server and client software,
and both the client and server operating system too. In this
particular case, the server told your wget that it is sending a file
of 307 MB, and that's what it got. See below:

> Length: 390,928,384 [application/octet-stream]

Right now, the server seems to be sending the full file:

Length: 4,685,895,680 [application/octet-stream]

So give it another try.

I intentionally left that bit out of my email - we don't know if the
initial 370MB is from the correct ISO file or from a different file.
It is best to download the whole 4.7GB or so once again.

that was being optimistic :) we anyway have the md5sum to back us up.
well.. there is a big penalty though, if we are wrong...

I take it you have never experienced the frustration of spending
several hours downloading 4.7GB only to find that the MD5 sums don't
match. :) Far better to spend an extra 8% time to download 300 MB or
so of additional data.

well... i did say there is a big penalty! :) that makes me think...
for these big images, shouldn't there be md5sums for every smaller
chunk, say for every 100 mb, and perhaps some tool support on the
client side to keep checking these md5sums so that we don't have to
redownload the entire stuff... just thinking aloud...

except for the tool support, i don't think it will take too much extra
time and space...

I think still there is some problem with the server. I couldn ping the

OK, got it. Your wget is bust. Upgrade it first - it can't handle
files bigger than 4GB.

4,685,895,680 - 390,928,384 = 4,294,967,296 = 2^32

Mine's wget-1.9.1-16.fc2 (on FC2) and wget-1.10.2-0.30E (on RHEL3).
What's yours?

I use GNU Wget 1.9.1 from debian sarge r1. I think this is the same as
the one which you are using in FC2. Any way I ll try to upgrade it now
and try again :)

In FC2, large file support seems to have been backported to 1.9.1 from
a later upstream version (1.10, probably):

* Fri Aug 27 2004 Karsten Hopp <karsten@redhat.de> 1.9.1-7

- clean up manpage (#117519)
- buildrequire texinfo (#123780)
- LFS patch, based on wget-LFS-20040630.patch from Leonid Petrov
  (#123524, #124628, #115348)

Check RH bugzilla:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=123524

On the other hand, in Debian Sarge, the bug is still unresolved:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=354989

Also, here for more details:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=320809

"wget 1.9 (in sarge) doesn't support large file system (LFS). This means
it cannot handle files > 2 GB. This is fixed in wget 1.10 (in etch,
sid)."

Yet another reason to ditch Debian and go for Redhat/Fedora.

HTH,

Hi
er..Please forgive me if you find this irrevelant to this list..But
since there are many software professionals around here, here goes..
Whilst roaming through the net i found this link.
http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CollegeAdvice.html
Since I am in college i thought this article was worth a read. But one
thing hit hard on my face..Heres an excerpt

>      1. Learn how to write before graduating.
>      2. Learn C before graduating.
>      3. Learn microeconomics before graduating.
>      4. Don't blow off non-CS classes just because they're boring.

>      7. No matter what you do, get a good summer internship.

See point no. 6...Maybe i have realised this very late, but do the
american coders see us as their nemesis???!!! are we stealing their
livelihood? followers of Reader's Digest may remember a similar article
a few issues back..
Flames away and please be gentle..I am still a kid

ok imagine this... you keep "kappu" in Electronic Circuits. Like as if
doing that course for 1 semester isn't hard enough, doing it 2 times is
twice as hard. So keep that in mind when u write the Non-CS exams :D

Why not? In a world where physical boundaries are being breached by the
Internet, it is all about the survival of the fittest isn't it. It
really shouldn't matter much as to where you are geographically located.

This is tough! From personal experience... you should start applying
early ;-)

Perfect Idea!.

>>      2. Learn C before graduating.


True, Very Very True. C is completely necessary for any software job, even
if you actually end up programming in java.

>>      3. Learn microeconomics before graduating.


You do that in anna-university, but the more important topics are slighted
and we end up doing balance sheets. Infact, during our exam poeple were more
prepared (worried) about balance sheets and less about how things like
perfect competition and oligopoly and NPV etc.. works. [if its greek and
latin to you, don't worry.. when you get to learn it in college, pay more
attention to that part, rather than a single balance sheet!].

Actually what  Mr.Spolesky means about non-CS classes is things which are
writing intensive, like "anthropology" (i guess he mentions that in the
article). Unfortunately our anna university syllabus does have such stuff in
the final year (ethics). The reason its unfortunate is this, There is a lot
of interesting stuff thats actually going on in the ethics syllabus, but in
an engineering college, you can never expect a PhD with philosophy to teach
it, and we get people who were never passionate about those subjects to
teach it. Reading Imanuel Kant is worse than reading kernel source code.

>>      5. Take programming-intensive courses.


For a computer science course, We have none of these in our syllabus.

Agreed.

Agreed again. One good place to start if you are a 2nd year is AU-KBC center
at MIT. and then you can apply for a whole series of internships that come
around during your even semester. Starting from Jawaharlal Nehru Center for
Advanced Scientific Research, IISC, IIT-M, IIMS, etc.. etc..

This is just an anti-reaction by the Americans who are just beginning to 
hear, but are yet to truly understand, that the world is flat. They just 
have to get used to it.

This is something i got from the dilbert blog.
http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/04/annoying_people.html#comment-16472926

<snip>

Ryan: I'm having trouble with my program.
John: Okay?
Ryan: I'm getting a compile error.
John: What does the error say?
Ryan: Um. (he checks.) It says "parse error on line 223".
John: Okay, what is on line 223?
Ryan: Um. I guess I should look at that shouldn't I?
Ahhh!!!! He's been working there, writing code, for a year! Why do I need to
hold his hand like this?

No surprises why all the jobs are comming to india.

You are on debian and still trying to download whole iso? why? you
should use jigdo. 
Jigdo downloads individual packages and builds the iso. If old cd
images/cds you already have contains some packages which are not
changed  in the iso you are downloading, jigdo will use local copy
thus saving time and bandwidth. Thus you will not face a situation to
discard 300mb and download whole iso just because last few bits were
missing.

In fact even a partly downloded iso can be mounted and told to jigdo
to use. It will use what ever package it can recover from this.

Jigdo is yet another reason to stay/migrate with/to debian

Yes but this is a more practical answer to it. Murphy's Law sadly forces
that we flunk the subject we are worst at. So invariably you are not
going to be happy with the choice of subjects you have to repeat!


And oh as for the AU syllabus, any subject after the 6th semester are
nothing but hog wash! It as getting an arrear in 4th year as it is to
pass in the previous years ;-)

/me wonders about his recent fixation about flunking :-(

<snip>
one more thing i would like to add is wget seems to have a file
limitation, which is not there with curl. As regards to checking
md5sum on individual chunks of data, bittorent seems to have that
feature.  One more reason to go for the torrents.

I attended a lecture at Indian Merchants Chambers yesterday on the new
government rule called MCA-21. The new rule provides that all document
sumbitted to the Ministry of Company Affaires now needs to be given in
digital form only. They will no longer accept physical documents.
Further, each of these documents will have to have a digital signature
of the persons who were earlier required to sign the physical
documents.

This is the first step to moving all governement documents to digital
form and save huge time and cost of users now wasted in standing in
line and submitting documents to the government.  The next will be Tax
authorities, followed by Excise and Customs. Land Records are expected
to be next thereafter.

There are 7 companies in India who are authorised to issue digital
certificates recorgnised under the Information Technology Act. TCS is
one who was present at the seminar and demonstrated the use of the
digital certificates. For those who have not used them, these are
stored by TCS on USB Tokens, which look like USB Pen drives but are
read-only 32KB drives with processors built in. You are supposed to
insert in the token in the UCB port and then ask the Online-Form to
pick up the digital certificate from the token and add it to the
document to submit to the government.

These certificates are based on 128 bit encryption and PKI.

TCS assured me that it is designed to work both on Linux and Mac in
addition to Windows and that they are including the relevant drivers
with the token.  However, the additional software tools they are
providing for automating digital signatures on other documents will
work only on Windows. I would like to know if any of you have used the
Digital Siganture / Digital Certificates that is being issued under
MCA-21 and can confirm that it works properly on Linux.

The other providers of Digital Certificates includes MTNL. While TCS
is charging Rs. 2075 for a 1 year valid certificate, MTNL is charging
Rs. 350. They are sending it to you on email !! Ofcourse, they are
doing this only at Malabar Hill Exchange and you have to go personally
to their office and they will verify that you are the person whose
name is on the form and your address, photo, etc.

I do not know much on Digital Certificates. However with this becoming
a major part of commercial and business transactions, I hope what the
government is doing does not work only on Windows. If necessary, we
(or perhaps FSF) will need to initiate a dialog with the government.

In the next year, it is estimated that just government requirment will
result in over 1 million digital certificates being issued. I think
the actual figure will be close to 5 million as more government
depatments like Income Tax, Sales Tax, Excise and Customs departments
move to "digital documents only" mode. (Just imagine - if every shop
keeper needs to file his sales tax returns online and needs a digital
certificate to be able to upload the return to the government). It
would be very important for us to ensure that Linux gets supported in
the process.

I guess they have the users private key on an ordinary USB device. Don't get
the part about 32KB drive with built in processor!! hogwash?

It doesn't matter where it is stored as long as one can ensure its not
stolen! Am sure gpg can very well be used on linux.

Hmm... I'm curious - what's the text book prescribed at AU for the
Economics course? We had: http://tinyurl.com/pxtvt (link to Amazon) as
the text, and it is one of the most lucidly written textbooks I have
ever had the pleasure to read.

What the original article implies (and seems to have been missed in
this thread) is that the student should take the initiative to learn
Economics. It is after all, a fascinating subject whose principles are
so simple that they can be mastered with a few hours of reading.

Lastly, learning a bit of macroeconomics will help you understand the
economic forces that are causing point #6, why "all the jobs are going
to India".

Apart from Economics, I'd add Statistics to the list of "must-learn"
subjects at engineering college.

Ah. The advantages of studying in an IIT, where every faculty member
is a PhD. Subjects like Psychology, Metallurgy etc. can all be
fascinating if taught by the right kind of person.

Would be worrysome if we assume that India and China will forever be the
sweatshops that make to order goods designed by and for the americans and
europeans!

What if we design and make things for ourselves.... and only after
satisfying the internal demand they seep through to the A & EU? Heck. We are
a billion ourselves... we outnumber the A & EU put together - meaning we are
a bigger market. So. IMO, we need not worry about competition. Nor China. We
only have to  focus on catering to our own demand. Design and build for our
market. Not blindly copy goods built for other markets.

Like CK Prahalad asked in some meeting of industry captains (parapharasing):
Water is scarce in India. So why do you still make soap that needs water!
Why not make a product that will clean but still not need water? Design
products for the market. Don't blindly copy what was designed for the
western market.

Remember, India was the country where the metaphoric milk and honey flowed
on the streets till about 16th century AD and it was every travellers dream
to visit India!

There is a Linux command for knowing the list of library dependencies

Can someone give me some pointer on command?

i.e.

Thanks I found that; 

I wanted this for the purpose of checking the dependencies for gcc. 

i.e. When I have to install a pre-build toolchain, what will I endup
installing apart from gcc?

I found, only glibc is the only library that gcc will depend on? Is it
so? If that is case what, where does the binutils come into picture.

ldd gcc

or

/lib/ld-<version>.so --list /usr/bin/gcc

note that this will show only the libraries which are loaded at
startup. the program can choose to load libraries at runtime. these
wont be included in this list. you can get all the loaded libraries at
any point during the execution of the process by

cat /proc/<pid>/maps | grep ' r-xp .*\.so[0-9.]*$'

it moves on...

Young boy, This is how god has designed the world:

"Every morning in the Forest, a Gazelle wakes up. It knows that it has
to run faster than the fastest Lion in the forest, or it will be killed by
the Lion. In the same forest every morning, a Lion wakes up. It knows that
it must at least outrun the slowest Gazelle in the  forest or it will starve
to death. It doesn't matter whether you are a Lion or a Gazelle... when the
sun comes up, you better be running."

>> do the American coders see us as their Nemesis???!!!
They see us and the Chinese,  as how the Gazelle sees the Lion.

>>I am worried!

Well. You don't have to. Understand this.



1. America is a super power.

2. The critical factors to be  a super power is to have large / strong
business enterprises with advanced technologies and a superior and an
un-challengeable army.

3. In the 21st century, IT, BT, EP etc play a very influential role in
determining the superiority of almost everything.

4.American younger generation has lived in all the comforts for ages
forgetting the importance of staying FIT. Most of them are dump now.

5. The article you mentioned is a wake up call for those  young
Americans. Actually
it is not for you.

6.The reason for this movement of work is Superiority of workmanship. (the
low price is only an additional advantage)

6.The work will move to who ever is best in doing that. If you are good in
doing that work, it will be moved to you. If a tribe in trobrian island is
able to do it better than you, it will be moved to him.

7.If the work is not moved the superior, then America will slowly loose the
technical superiority lead and, America will be moved ; from enjoying the
status of a super power. That is the nature's law.(Note that man who is
refusing to give the work to an American is also an American)

9. So It doesn't matter whether you are a Indian or an American... when the
sun comes up, you better be running and stay FIT. Always.

10.If you are still confused read, Bhagavath Gita chapter starting" Why are
you Worrying??"

Unfortunately, this "text-book" stlye super boring book was what we ended up
doing for the course. Its a good book, but its just a text-book. A
collection facts, nothing more. There aren't interesting arguments that
leave you thinking about it after you've closed. it isn't something that
would make you change your career from computer science to economice because
it greatly increased your passion for the subject. There is nothing of the
sort in the book. plain facts thats all.

Not, really necessary. Microeconomics is fine, but when you actually learn
macro-economics you end up learning a lot of necessary stuff for
understanding macro-economics itself, but not really necessary in an
every-day computer programmer life-cycle. (Except when you are desinging
something like pay-pal which end up causing changes so big, that you need to
understand some macro-economics to totally understand whats going on).

GNU toolchain is a broad name give to a set of tools which includes make
system, compiler, debuggers, linkers, assemblers etc. Binutils just one
package in the toolchain for linkers, assemblers and it contains tools
like as, ld, ranlib, ar, nm ......

Dear Alexander,

As far as I know, The GCC will invoke the ranlib, ar, nm and other tools
from it when required in the process of building an obj or executable
file. I was just trying to understand whether the GCC has there tools
inbuilt or it calls through something like scripts.

AFAIK, GCC will not run ranlib or any other binutils on the executable
it produces, Its left to the user. As an example if I want to create a
archive file, either I run the ar command separately on the gcc output
files or will notify the make system to do so.

I have gone through the link but could not found the required.
Actually, there is no prob in CD writer configuration/creating image/CD 
burning in multi session.

I googled and found that if one is writing in multisession, first 
wirting takes 23MB more space.
Second time onwards, it takes 14MB more space.
But how this space can be identified as CD displays only files size 
which are written.
May be, if we can read the TOC(table of contents) then we can get it but 
how?
TOC is updated and carried forward in every next session writing.

I hope, his Q is, Why extra 23MB/14MB Space is used in multi session? 
and How to calculate the remining space during multi-session 
CD-Writing ? Am I Correct ?

Boot your PC with RH9 CD#1 in rescue mode and reconfigure lilo conf
file. Plz note down and post the error message, if any.

So, you will be using grub bootloader, by default.

Why? You can still have a separate entry for this
newly compiled kernel.

You can remove the previous kernel provided you are
happy with your newly compiled kernel.

You are using grub. Why did you give lilo?

Ahh! ok. Remember to remember the golden words:

"I will _be_ conscious of what I am doing when I am
root".

> i say some kernel panic error, 

1. It could be that your path to the new kernel is
incorrect.

 OR

2. In your newly compiled kernel you don't have file
system support for the file-system used in the hard
disk.

> it not at all
> entering into the system.

No problem. Learn how to debug from grub prompt.

When grub loads, you can change its arguments on the
fly. Press 'e' to edit the highlighted option. You can
edit whichever line you want and see if it boots.
Google for some HOWTOs and tutorials.

Check your path.

Yes.

Your data is intact. Its just that your kernel is not
booting.

Subject: [Ilugc] Problem Simulating REMOVAL Media
Message-ID: <3AEC1E10243A314391FE9C01CD65429B3FD3E0@mail.esn.co.in>

 

Dear Linux Kernel Govers,

 

Here I am making an attempt to simulate the Removable media in a Simple
block driver module.

It results in a segmentation fault raising the kernel module count to 1
which makes me to reboot it.

 

I am doing the following when trying to simulate the Removable media:

 

/******* Simple block Driver request ********/ 

static void sbd_request(request_queue_t *q)

{

    struct request *req;

    int status;

 

    while ((req = elv_next_request(q)) != NULL) {

      if (! blk_fs_request(req)) {

          printk (KERN_NOTICE "Skip non-CMD request\n");

          end_request(req, 0);

          continue;

      }

 

      /* Simple memcpy based on the request ; 

   Returns success or failure which is passed to
end_that_request_first() */

      status = sbd_transfer(&Device, req->sector,
req->current_nr_sectors,

                  req->buffer, rq_data_dir(req));

 

      // end_request(req, 1);

      if(!end_that_request_first(req, status, req->current_nr_sectors))
{

                  blkdev_dequeue_request(req);

                  end_that_request_last(req);

            }

    }

 

I issue an IOCTL from the application after the module is loaded and
memory device is mounted.

The IOCTL code executed is as follows:

 

/* Simulate the Removal Media Disk */

Case REMOVE_MOUNTED_DISK:

 

            if(Device.bdev)

                  invalidate_bdev(Device.bdev,1);

 

            del_gendisk(Device.gd);

            put_disk(Device.gd);

            blk_cleanup_queue(Queue);

            vfree(Device.data);

            return 0;

 

After this, I get a segmentation fault either when I issue a 

#ls /mnt

OR

When I try to unload the driver module?

 

Result is module cannot be unloaded, and some times it hangs the console
terminal.

 

Regards,

Mukund Jampala

For Network programming, I'd definitely recommend:

Richard Stevens. 1998. UNIX Network Programming. (2nd
ed.). Prentice Hall.

 http://www.kohala.com/start/unpv12e.html
 
For the GNU/Linux implementation, check Dan Kegel's
code examples:

 http://kegel.com/unpv1/

Have fun,

For some time, I thought your comment "super boring" was directed at
Samuelson :) Now that I have my perspective restored, let me reiterate
a pet peeve of mine - that Indian textbook authors somehow ALWAYS
manage to get their target audience - the students - completely
disinterested in the subject. The best thing about studying in IIT was
that all the foundation courses - semesters 1-3 and part of semester 4
- had such interestingly written text books - books that I know people
still cherish and occupy prominent positions in their bookshelves.
Recently - almost 12 years after I was done with all Mathematics
courses - I simply couldn't resist buying the latest edition of
Kreyszig, just for the heck of it - for the pleasure of reading
through a well-written textbook. On the other hand, I still dread my
pre-degree course's Mathematics text books (Calicut University) - each
one a horror story in itself.

You may be in touch with NRC-Foss people operating out of MIT Madras. Some
efforts are beeing taken by them in the same direction and aligning with
them will make you resourceful in addition to avoiding duplication of

         your package?
Date   : Tue, 25 Apr 2006 14:56:31 -0400
>From   : Richard Stallman 

The GNU Project is participating in Google's Summer of Code program.
(See http://code.google.com/soc/mentorfaq.html for details.)  In
summary:

 * Summer of Code 2006 is a program that offers student developers
   stipends to work on development of free software.

 * The FSF will be paid $500 per project, too.

 * We need people to volunteer to mentor these students, and also
   people to evaluate other ideas that students may suggest.

 * Payment to the student is contingent upon feedback by the mentor.

 * There is no requirement that the finished code be included in the
   package itself, but goal is to get code we want to use.

 * For FSF-copyrighted GNU packages, we will ask the student to sign
   the usual copyright assignment before getting paid, to make sure
   there will be no legal obstacle to using his code.

If you are willing to mentor one or more projects, this could be of
great use to the GNU Project -- it would introduce new volunteers to
your package's code base, get a little funds for the FSF, and enhance
the GNU operating system.

Before you volunteer to be a mentor, please make sure you can actually
spare the time to do the work; having mentors become unresponsive or
drop out would be very bad.  It is important for projects to be
feasible for a good student-level hacker to do in 2 or 3 months;
nothing super large.

It is ok if you talk with student candidates that you already know are
capable, to plan projects with them.  That is a good way to produce
projects that are really likely to get done, and done well.

To volunteer as a mentor, please send email to
<summer-of-code@gnu.org>.  Please describe the student projects you
offer to mentor, and for each one, say which GNU package it will
enhance.

We need to find a "backup mentor" for each project; the backup mentor
is someone who will take over in case you become busy, sick, or
otherwise unavailable.  If you can think of any obvious suggestions
for backup mentors for your projects, please mention the suggestions
in your mail.  (We consider these suggestions are tentative, so you
can mention them first, then ask them if they are available.)  But if
you can't think of anyone, please suggest your project anyway.  We
will look for a suitable backup mentor.

James Youngman <jay@gnu.org> will be taking care of accumulating the
offers and putting them in our web site, but he could use one or two
people to help.  If you are willing to help, please write to
<summer-of-code@gnu.org>.

Hi All
I am trying to work on a block driver.

I have  a read call from my user test file and is as follows:
read(fd, ubuf, 1024));

In the driver: the request ( read_sector )   gets invoked with 
parameters specified  in current request.
cur_req(&blkdrv, sector,  CURRENT->current_nr_sectors,  CURRENT->buffer);

Anyone pl tell how the the "no:of bytes"  parameter ( 3rd arg) in read 
call gets converted to sector( starting sector from where to  read  )   
& current_nr_sectors (number of sectors to read)
in the driver.

Can i give the sector number from where to start  and number of sectors 
to read from user test file.

Thanks in Advance

Too far and varied to compare... also, svn is the norm (not CVS)  
nowadays.... so am adding svn to the list below....

am giving a try at comparison....

CVS : centralized
SVN : centralized (svk is distributed)
CC : centalized and distributed(as an option)

CVS : no merge tracking
SVN : feature under development (there are third party options, tho)
CC : has merge tracking facilities

CVS : no atomic commits
SVN : has atomic commits
CC : has atomic commits

CVS : uses pserver or cvsnt for network based access
SVN : uses http:// , svn:// and file:// based access
CC : not sure, but I think uses some properietary method

CVS : open source
SVN : open source
CC : properietary

CVS : free
SVN : free
CC : paid and expensive

     Do you have anything in specific to compare?

Madan.

Used *ldd* to find all the shared library dependencies. You can also use 
*nm* to find the list of objects from object files. This is very useful 
when you have all libraries in write place but some dependent symbols 
not in right place.

afaik, elf makes little distinction between shared object libraries
and executables. wat u need is just a table of relocatable function
symbols in an elf object for it to be used by some other program. in
addition, if there is a special symbol indicating the start of the
program, it is capable of being run, and that function is invoked on
execution, and it calls main in the code you write.

btw, because u asked... try this as well :)

/lib/libc.so.<version> --help

it moves on...

Two ways of looking at it.
1. FOSS experts are less in number thats why they are in demand.
2. People(Majority of Developers) are still windows-addict...

One more thing i would like to add is that the top big companies are the
ones making linux down as they need money and get clients and clients mostly
be Windows Users and i also have a small grinch that the OSS projects arent
coming to India. In this month LFY, they have given a cover story of
"Go,Open Source" in South Africa. Its really nice to hear such campaigns are
being undertaken directly by the Government itself. I am sure, if we conduct
these campaigns in India, it wouldnt be that much success.

"Go,Open Source" - it would be great to have it in India or atleast in our
locality and thats the best we can start and sure there are many FOSS
experts hidden...!

Curious why you say that. Sourceforge is still on CVS, so do you have
any authoritative references that show a large-scale migration to SVN?

I think you need to enable and start the HTTP server (steps 4-6 below,
probably - haven't used 10g EE, and certainly never have managed
Oracle via a web interface).

No. Sourceforge supports both CVS and SVN, and a number of sf projects
have already migrated to SVN.

I think he means to say all new installations use SVN rather than CVS. 
With Trac, Subversion is a killer combo.

Sourceforge recently enabled subversion for all it's projects. It was 
long overdue:

I see that now. It does mean that there indeed is a large-scale
migration over to subversion from cvs.

what do you mean? the sourceforge project is on cvs? or that with
sourceforge, you only have cvs as a vc option? (the latter is not true).
If you mean the sourceforge code is not on cvs, well, I do not know about
the validity of that statement, but even so, its just a choice people
make. But am sure its not a conscious happy choice... (cvs is almost
no-more-dev nowadays, so many bugs and so little done on them, oh, wont I
miss directory versioning and atomic commits on CVS?)... its just a matter
of time...

> so do you have

Sure, the following are some of the major projects that have migrated....

gcc
kde
openoffice (http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/SVNMigration)
gnome is migrating (they are facing some date-version issues during
conversion)
sourceforge provides svn as an option too....
(http://sourceforge.net/docs/E09/en/) just that they cant force every
project into svn...

    I forget where... but sometime in mid-2005, I read a survey which
indicated that svn has overtaken cvs in terms of number of opensource
projects using it.

    Again, svn is meant to be all that cvs is, plus more.... am only
surprised that you are contesting my statement... its more of a 'as a
matter of fact' than a revolutionary statement that I made.... :)

    Feel free to engage me in a dialouge if you strongly feel otherwise.

Regards,
Madan.

You can try Flumotion (http://flumotion.net).It's based on Gstreamer.

Oh no, I am not contesting your statement at all. It has been several
years since I used any SCM tool, so was surprised to see that CVS,
which has been the de facto standard, has lost so much of its install
base. Now that I look at SVN's home page, I can see that several high
profile projects are using it.

>Vamsee.

I have used darcs. Quite good and very easy to setup and use. The approach
is different from svn, CVS etc and it is completely distributed. The way
that darcs handles patches is wonderful. However the problem is that darcs
is written in haskell and haskell compiler is also written in haskell :)
this sometimes complicates things when you don't have darcs binaries for
your platform and have to compile it from source.

The other problem with darcs is the fact there is very limited tool
support  - Also, there are no gui tools that I am aware off.

A friend of mine was trying to run Red Hat servers for

Thanks for the info. I have removed it.

say a expert is defined as per answers.com
   1.  A person with a high degree of skill in or knowledge of a
certain subject.
   2.  a. The highest grade that can be achieved in marksmanship.
        b. A person who has achieved this grade.

Having, involving, or demonstrating great skill, dexterity, or
knowledge as the result of experience or training. See synonyms at
proficient

in terms of FOSS, if u know any of the Open Source Tool's
functionalit... then u r considered as expert in that.

Would not a person excellently skilled in the windows environment be in
demand too :-) After all experts are always scarce not just FOSS experts.

what do u mean by demand? if u have excess people working on microsoft
technologies, it wont be difficult to get people. u got to choose the
right expert from the lowest no. like sysadmin job.

find the right FOSS experts is just similar to finding a sysadmin.
because sysadmin job is smaller in number than the programming job.
same applies and this answers ur question. i agree that all experts
are always scarce. but in that finding FOSS experts is much more
difficult.

I wish I knew about 'What is Mathematics' by R. Courant when I was in
college! Its a 50 yr old manuscript which gives a superb perspective to the
field of math. Not much about discrete math though. So, the 'hard core'
programmers might wonder whats in it for them! But my advice is: dont
willingly wear blinders. IMO, this should be the introductory text to math
for every engineering student.

To give you a flavour of its age, it  talks about the difficulties in
proving the Fermat's last theorem and the four colour theorem! Though, the
revised edition talks about the proofs (which came much later..... I think
after the original authors expired!) of these in the appendices.

The book is published by Oxford Univ Press, next to USIS. You will have to
register for it and they will inform you when it is available - takes a
couple of months. But well worth the wait.

not so much migration - but people tend to put their new projects 
under svn. Another thing i have noticed is that more and more 
developers are putting their projects under svn+trac on their own 
servers rather than on sf or berlios or whatever - at the most they 
have a link to sf for publicity purposes.

Hi,

I hope many of us know about the LFS (Linux From Scratch is a project
that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own
customized Linux system entirely from source.)

Here is a similar kind of project, by John Goerzen, the Debian From 
Scratch :). http://people.debian.org/~jgoerzen/dfs/html/

HTH :)

Hey, i think there is a big difference between LFS and DFS. I think it is
not a step-by-step procedure for building a debian system from source as LFS
is.

According to the jabber site wildfire is 98% compliant with XMPP whereas
ejabberd is 91%. Wildfire also has asterisk integration. So integrating your
PSTN network to your LAN IM would be a possibility.

For client you can try jwChat. Its a pure ajax client.

If you use apt-build with DFS, you can compile Debian from source. See
http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/01/10/1727246

and

http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/apt-build

true... sf of late has become over loaded and vc response times have
been far from satisfactory. in fact, e17 recently migrated to an own
server, with a dedicated server for devel access and one more for
anonymous access (mirrored every now and then)...

it moves on...

I was really surprised to see ejabberd working out of the box without any
issues!..cool....and i checked with Kopete and Gaim.Both work flawlessly. I
dont want to try jwchat as i have been instructed not to use web interface
for chatting :).

http://www.process-one.net/en/projects/ejabberd/docs.html - this link has
docs on how to install ejabberd and make it ready as server. There is a cool
video and that video helped me (the installation is so simple that you
wouldnt require any videos ;-) ).

There are many options available in ejabberd, now we are going to implement
in the server. So , now it is time to get stuck up with problems and i think
then we will learn to customize with options :).

Thank You all.

Hi! everybody,

I came across this wonderful site and would like to know if any of our
members used this or know more about this?

I was fascinated by the optical data link covering a range of around
1.4kmwith 10Mbps bandwidth.

I would like to know more about this. Any other pointers will be
appreciated.

I marked it as OT but this whole thing is heavily on Linux and othe GPLed

Enjoy reading this.

GPL is viral, meaning whenever you combine it with some other license,
you'll need to release your software as GPL.

Read the GPL FAQ for more info.

Hai ilugies,

      My task here is to run a Cluster based software on Linux.

     We are using a Simulator for testing purposes which is purely cluster
based and is running on Windows 2003 Server OS. And also this software is
ASP based.

      I know that ASP can be run in Apache, but do we need to install
modules???

      And also suggest some Cluster Management Software which can run in
Ubuntu.

Thanks in Advance.

check this http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/gdb/gdb_25.html

GDB provides these facilities for debugging multi-thread programs:


   - automatic notification of new threads
   - `thread threadno', a command to switch among threads
   - `info threads', a command to inquire about existing threads
   - `thread apply [threadno] [all] args', a command to apply a command
   to a list of threads
   - thread-specific breakpoints

OTOH, you can choose to use software that have apache/BSD style license  
which are NOT viral...  In which case, you can decide to apply copyright  
to certain parts and copyleft to certain parts of *your* code...

It is easier for others to make out the thread context when u reply to

I am forwarding this mail to the group. May be they could share their

public domain is not a license. It means that the author has given 
up his copyright. So you license your code under GPL, and in your 
license you mention xyz part of the application is public domain 
code. You cant license the public domain code, but you can license 
your modification of the public domain code under GPL

Can you be specific or name any package on which this problem appears.

Did you add the Universe and Multiverse Repositories in your
/etc/apt/sources.list file?

After which you have to run a $sudo apt-get update

You can do this by Settings -> Repositories

We don't handle shipit requests as of yet. The CDs are shipped from the
Netherlands, and we don't have any contact with them either. So I can't
really tell you about your order status.
What I can do, however, is that I can ask somebody in Chennai or nearby
to send in a couple of Ubuntu CDs. Let me see what I can do about this ...

Disable all unwanted modules (M) that you don't need
from the kernel configuration - make menuconfig. By
default, most of them are enabled.

Why not request directly from the ShipIt site... they do ship CDs to India. 
My brother (who lives in Delhi) requested Ubuntu CDs through their site, and 
5 CDs were sent to him from the Isle of Man. In fact, I have one of those 
CDs sitting on my table right now!

thing..#alsamixer also fails.

#alsamixer
alsamixer:  function_ctl_open failed for default : No such Device

All  we should do,is to load a proper sound card driver.is n't it?

I also thing that,the card type is RealTech Semiconductor Inc.
The driver looks like snd-intelx80.ko.But nothing seems to work.

I also searched in Google.i did not get relavant or moresuitale one t

I guess the first thing you should try is to get a more recent kernel,
like 2.6.11+ as the Debian kernels have the drivers for Intel HDA
compiled in them already, IIRC.

Otherwise, get the latest ALSA drivers from
http://www.alsa-project.org ; in particular, get driver and
utilities. Then, get the kernel headers for your kernel using

apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)

(In bash, $uname -r expands to the right kernel version).

Untar the alsa-drivers, run configure as 
./configure --with-kernel=/usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)

Then, make; make install.

Finally, run alsaconf to select the required driver.

HTH.

Hi,

> pointers to do step by step installation on phython on nokia 6600 phones.

I have got this working - is pretty nifty actually! :)

It is pretty easy to do, just download the 'sis' file and install it
as you would normally install any application on your phone - just
send the sis file to the phone from the computer using bluetooth.

Now, actually writing a program is a pain-in-the-neck! You can either
type in the program in the interactive console that comes with the
phone, but ofcourse typing in any program on the phone keypad
shouldn't attempted unless you are seriously bored!

Another option is to use the python console running on ur phone from
ur computer. This is done using the btconsole python program on the
phone, and some fooling around on the computer. I had to mess around
with minicom and such on the computer to get it working, and even when
it did, it was pretty flaky, the connection kept getting lost and all
that. Though, when it did work, it was very cool! :)

This is  however, my experience when i tried this around 6 months
back, perhaps things are better with the newer versions. For help on
using btconsole, some amount of googling should help. For more links
related to this you could probably rummage around in my bookmarks at
http://del.icio.us/kmshiva/nokia and
http://del.icio.us/kmshiva/nokia%2Bpython.

So you don't xerox stuff, you take photostatic copies? Do you use
escalators or gramophones? Do you try to be platform-neutral and ask
the chemist for acetyl salicylic acid? Do you look for zippers and
velcros or you have platform-neutral names for these too?

Amazing how techlogy creeps into linguistics..
One of my friends once told me he had bought a "Sony IPod" and wanted
to know how to connect it to his PC and "upload" songs into it.

Subject: [Ilugc] Tamil support: Ubuntu Dapper Beta
Message-ID: <20060430091549.60890.qmail@web50209.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

I have installed Ubuntu Dapper Beta on my T41. Thanks
to Balu ("bman4344") for the quick download. 

Installation was smooth.

I am currently testing Tamil support in this distro. I
have installed ttf-indic-fonts, scim,
gnome-language-ta et. al.

* Able to use tamil keyboard input (unicode and
written tamil form) with Gedit, Gaim, Abiword, Vim and
Mozilla Firefox. 

* Gnome tamil interface is also good.

* I am not using transliteration, and don't want to
use any software that does it. Prefer to type fully in
Tamil.

* Have setup CAPS lock key to switch between US and
tamil unicode.

* &#2980; +&#3009; = &#2980;&#3009;
  &#2980; +&#3010; = &#2980;&#3010;
 which is the same as our written tamil.

* Gaim, Firefox and Gedit automatically do the above
translation as per our written tamil.

http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/tamil/text-editor.jpg

* In gnome-termial, when doing a cat on a tamil file,
the "dots" are printed separately, and certain
double-characters are interchanged:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/tamil/terminal.jpg

Is anyone else experiencing this in your distro?

* When I type in Abiword and export it to .html,
certain junk characters get printed before the
double-characters:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/tamil/tamil-fonts.html

1. In UTF-8, with gnome-terminal the characters, dots
get displayed separately. Is it common with other
distros or packages for tamil support? Is there any
other editor that I can use for UTF-8 tamil support
with proper display?

2. How can I generate HTML files with tamil input, or,
do I need to set anything for the junk characters
printed when Abiword (.abw) is exported to html (as
seen from the above)?

Appreciate any feedback,

Thanks,

SK

Scariest part about that was she was dead serious.
Read the comments, that's the best part. One of the people commenting
on her blog points out to her saying that her own website is hosted on
Linux!

Even I thought she was being tongue-in-cheek, but I read through some
of her older blog entries and realized that she was serious.

For example:

http://shelleytherepublican.com/2005/12/unleashing-wrath-of-god-gays.html
http://shelleytherepublican.com/2005/12/get-to-know-your-enemy-islam.html

On a lighter note, here's another, older article:

that one almost killed me with laughter.

and rolling on the floor with tears in my eyes when I read that a week back
I guess!!!

*FYI from slashdot.org

I came across Explorer Destroyer
<http://www.explorerdestroyer.com/>yesterday, which is a project that
aims to increase the market share of
Firefox in a slightly more proactive way than is usual. They provide some
code which you add to your front page which presents a banner to IE users
urging them to switch to using Firefox. As a bonus, you can potentially make
some money via Google's Firefox referral program.*

I dont think this will increase the market share.

>usual. They provide some code which you add to your front page which
presents a banner

but u know if u add those page, it will definitely annoy the user who
visits your website.

this will work only if a user visits a site using IE and then clicks
on Google's firefox referral progra

Shuttleworth. u need not express anything else.

Ok, this is also seen in Gnome menus. I can live with
it.

> 2. How can I generate HTML files with tamil input

Bluefish works like a charm! 

* With UTF-8, Abiword can export .abw to .pdfs. Looks
good.

* To use TeX, download wntamil.zip created by the
Humanities and Arts Computing Center, University of
Washington, Seattle, Washington:

http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/wntamil.html

The list of files are:

ftp://cam.ctan.org/tex-archive/language/tamil/wntamil/

If you have Tetex package installed, you can use the
above:

1. First run metafont on the wntml10.mf:

  mf wntml10.mf

This will create the wntml10.2602gf file.

2. Compile tamilize.c:

  gcc tamilize.c -o tamilize

3. To run the given example:

  ./tamilize readme.doc readme.tex

4. Run tex on readme.tex:

  tex readme.tex

This will create the readme.dvi file

5. To create .ps and .pdf files:

  dvips readme.dvi -o readme.ps
  ps2pdf readme.pdf

You can use evince or xpdf to view the .pdf file.

If you are interested in fonts and TeX, the following
is a fantastic metafont tutorial:

Ubuntu rockz!
