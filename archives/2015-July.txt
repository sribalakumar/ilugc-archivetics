Dear Contributors,

Thank you

It depends on what customization changes the above distros have made
when building their software.

One fairly important issue you will find is that ubuntu ppa's won't work 
using apt-add-repository

It's easy to workaround however. I had a similar issue with using ubuntu 
ppa's in hamara linux:

may be this is little Out of topic.

FSFTN as a community form, what did it achieve? i am curious to know.

Google says fsftn.org - This site may be hacked. Timeline of events are
upto 2013 from the menu.

i am not here to pin point.

whether its a committee or community, its the individual contribution that
matters.

Hi,

>>whether its a committee or community, its the individual contribution that
matters.

True, having said so, I see quick decision making ability on
discrepancies,goal setting,transparency can be additional advantage of a
committee than to have a kind of 'pseudo' FBDL in subtle title 'office boy'.

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Not only electing the coordinator - Any official activities should be
handled only by people who are actively involved, and a discussion should
ensue in person. Anybody using the ILUGC name should take permission from
this core group. The names in  this group might vary over time, but there
should be a core group made of people who show positive interest.

Am really wondering if this list has lost its relevance. We are not
pursuing technical discussions of the latest technologies - instead we
spend more time worrying about who is facilitating the meetings. If we
split this list into administrative and technical, there would be more
administrative mails than technical ones.

Maybe more young blood is required.

Madan

NO please no split and in case you are thinking that we are spending
"MORE" time about administration you are completely mistaken as an old
( relatively) silent member who doesnt live in chennai anymore I feel
that there is not even administration activity going on.

For example if these were the days of KG (lawgon) and this is the same
mail I am sure you would see bharati ,raman ,thyagu , raja su ,
srinivasan ( academic and devel ) etc actively discussing even this
same topic with more passion than now , the 23 mails in the thread is
just nothing compared to those good old days.
---
Speaking on topic :
I agree with thyagu about young blood. When t shrini was appointed I
was very happy and energetically he played a key role in the glug. And
yes this LUG needs really a kick start but I am not sure how !

Message-ID: <CABJBktFDD1ENXaGj7WGHpo0aSSDQSS0irXtw+Xo=gGTTP3_wsw@mail.gmail.com>

I was reading this post from a friend Shirish agarwall from pune who
is a member of debian community and a key participant in community
events in pune and also an organiser for many debian events across the
country.

Here are some points about community problems
a. Factionalism
b. Cabalism (or simply Cabals)
As have been part of both parts do understand that both factions and
cabals start with good intentions but sometimes later warp beyond
recognition.
Next he goes on to say

c. No communication, Mis-communication
d. Fragmented content with contradictory messages.
The above two I have also seen time and again as a ?feature? of the
Indian FOSS community at large where most communities in India don?t
really communicate to other FOSS communities or world at large or are
pretty bad at things.

Read more at https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/2015/06/22/indian-foss-communities-closed-source/
its quite interesting and is relevant to ILUGC also !
PS : As of now I am just posting this to ILUGC as I believe this
community is one of the few strong ones left in India.

Pavithran

Hi all,
Could you elaborate a bit rather than just saying you don't buy into the 
argument. I will be able to give at least 1 example of each which are 
public, there are many more for sure.

But would like to hear what you have to say/share before saying anything 
else.

I find foss communities in India very similar to those that I have 
interacted with in other countries.

I also find some differences across generations - with younger / newer 
communities being more liberal / open and less
fixated around rules.

I think you can see something similar in licensing. The vast majority of 
FOSS projects used to be GPL, things are much
more liberal these days.

Since 2014,  FSFTN has started to use discourse as a platform to engage,
discuss and organize. You can find the public events and campaigns here
http://discuss.fsftn.org/category/public-events-campaigns

FSFTN is very actively engaged in building Free Software, Free Culture &
Free Infrastructure communities around TamilNadu and Pondicherry. FSFTN
organizes Summer Camp every year (Last month Summer Camp for 2015 was
organized at IIT Madras), it has also some College / regional level GLUG's
affiliated with it, it took the issue of violation of Net Neutrality
offline through public campaigns at Chennai and Puducherry, Documentary
Screening, organize workshops for general public like Cryptoparty,
Initiating community projects, etc.,

The site was compromised months back due to this vulnerability (

pointing out, the sites needs to be updated and activists at FSFTN have
already started to work on it.

At the time this post was originally circulated on a list I had
reached out to the author with a request to provide a set of examples
which illustrate the problems he perceives. The pair of instances
cited in the post [(a) no calendaring and (b) not enough developer
interest in defect reports] do not seem to add up to the specific
problems that are being drawn. In fact, it is egregious to pass off an
anecdote_of_one as a general perception.

The author has been a participant in various communities over a period
of time. And is well aware that the question of "calendar for FOSS
events" comes up in a cyclical manner. However, it is also somewhat
painfully obvious that no one has taken the time to publish a set of
requirements such a calendar/system would have. That single act (of
'product management') would have provided the jump-off point for
college students or, similar (recall that PLUG generally organizes the
monthly meetings at SICSR) to consider a prototype implementation.
Having said that, the author also chooses to ignore that across Pune
and other cities, the general purpose (user) groups viz. LUGs and like
are being supplanted by niche/specialized meetups. One can see this
trend in the increasing number of groups being lit up on services like
meetup.com. An oft quoted statement around the FOSS model of software
development is "scratch your own itch". I am somewhat bewildered that
the author has chosen to not consider putting the absence of a
calendar in that context and attempted to devise an understanding of
what it means in terms of a "maker approach".

Without specific example of "cabals", it would be somewhat difficult
to paint an entire generation/group of participants to be prolific
members of secret coteries. To the last point of "no communication" I
would put forward that this is an orthogonal comprehension of
community growth and the model around community formation. Communities
do not talk with communities, people do. And across India there are
enough examples of individuals (participants and contributors) who
work within the upstreams of their projects, laterally across projects
of their own interest and within their own community around the
geographical location.

This discussion can be of material interest only if there is enough
specific examples discussed (with names redacted, if required) and
thereafter conclusions drawn.

That was just one part of it. What would you say then about issue in 
wikipedia India where there were two forks? And the issue is not limited 
to wikipedia alone, for some - it comes to the fore, in others it just 
below the surface. The problem is it's easy to be shot as the messenger 
when you say something like that. Also any example or examples can 
easily be construed to be straw man examples as well.

The specific example that I shared with you was for another community 
but the point is/was these kind of issues are prevalent in most 
communities.

Even if you take calendaring, I doubt that most of the LUGs either have 
their own calendar or even attempt to reach out to various other LUGs 
when events happen on some common calendaring system, the same could be 
said for special interest groups as well.

And I wouldn't even go into the sort of moderation some of the 
communities apply for something basic as mailing lists although it was 
heartening to see PLUG change its tactics, although somewhat too little, 
too late :( .

Meetup.com is not a solution for the problem per-se. And it is not an 
issue of "maker approach" only, if you look at meetup.com as a probable 
solution, it is a jungle because all sorts of communities are meeting.

For instance, while it would be somewhat easy to know of SIG's, but if I 
wanted to have a list of all FOSS groups (which include SIG's) all over 
India, that's a sort of next to impossible task.

I wish there was a way to hack meetup to get info. on even all tech 
meetups in India but that's also not possible. I have to give a city 
name to get some listing happening :(

Also not all the communities either know or have persons who could 
manage meetup.com because it becomes another site to look at for events 
apart from facebook,lwn.net, twitter.com, mailing lists etc. etc.

There are communities which use both facebook and meetup as a dumping 
ground for events and there is nobody to answer even simple queries.

I wish there was something like lwn.net for India which would be neutral 
place where people could post event stuff and be able to gather intel on 
all FOSS events happening in the country, do accept that don't have any 
ideas on the subject other than to have something similar like that 
albeit on the regional (India) scale.

I was not talking about the upstreams of projects, I was talking more of 
lateral integration as in getting more people in your community as well 
as talking to other communities per-se.

I don't want to go there as this will just in-flame the issue more.

Looking at the campaigns, i rarely see that FSFTN encourages in
contribution to the community in terms of code or manual or bug fixing etc.

most of them are related to consumption or installation.

Most of them are related to Net Neutrality :) .

I most of the time see that ILUGC promotes  installation, usages etc but
never influence people to write / contribute free software. (including
myself)

One question to all ILUGC members:

Out of all the members in ILUGC, how many of them are real contributors in
terms of code, testing, manuals to the GNU / LINUX or any Free Software
projects etc?

Just curious to know. i may be wrong too.

I am not sure where the messenger is being shot at. I am asking the
messenger to pass along specifics of the message unbiased by personal
anecdotes. With regards to the Wikipedia situation you call out - have
you asked on the relevant lists about what it means to have "forks"?
Also, why do you term these as 'forks'?

Straw-man examples wouldn't buttress your hypothesis, would they? As
much as I appreciate the fact that you took time to write this up, I
am perplexed that you continue to respond in "I do have more context
but that is not in share-ready form" manner through the post and this
response.

Calendaring is an utility (in both the colloquial form of the word and
the economic interpretation). And it is somewhat of a stretch to
consider the LUGs across the country to be decision driven bodies. At
best they have some legal structure, at worst these are continually
ad-hoc formations around a small nucleus of individuals.

I am not very sure how PLUG's moderation is relevant to this
discussion. If it is, please explain.

You have chosen to selectively respond to the paragraph. However, why
is meetup.com not a solution to the problem?

The idea that there will be a directory of SIGs which would be off
immense interest to an individual does have merit. However, your
statement seems to be from the perspective of a potential consumer of
such a service and not the maintainer of one. There are enough such
problem statements formulated around "Oh! I wish we had this ..." and
often they are translated into a business/revenue opportunity.

And what is wrong with that? A monster directly of all meetups
happening today across India seems like an interesting exercise but
not something which would benefit one individual (you aren't expected
to be at all places at the same time). A stretched analogy would be
that you don't get the availability of all cabs across all the cities
when you use any particular operator's mobile device.

Meetups are local and even hyper-local. It isn't a mart.

Examples would help. I keep repeating this and you seem to choose to
ignore this point. Hand-wavy statements often lead to conclusions one
wishes to reach.

I am amused with this "for India" thing. At one point you seem to
indicate that "for India" communities are worse places than the "other
than India" ones. At other instances you prefer a "for India"
implementation. LWN.net would not be averse to listing the events. It
requires actual people to do the listing. They do not happen by
sprinkling magic pixie dust in air. The catch is that there aren't
actual people willing to do this.

Please provide an example to demonstrate what is it that you see as a gap.

Then don't make statements which you don't want to back up with
citations. It would help in more ways than you can imagine.

?i read all the threads and kept my reply for the weekend ;-) since i find
some value in the arguments at the same time do not agree with OP's
sweeping statements about communities at large.

 Sinking feelings and dejections are part of community living .This happens
more when you try to do something and you do not have buy in from
collective on  your ideas  as an individual .The way i deal with it is
"Just do it" i mean if i feel there is something to be done if i can do it
i just do it do not try to take permissions consents etc.... others will
follow if they like the idea  or the idea will die its own natural death if
people did not like it.

if there are somethings which involves some resources then i go back to the
group and ask and wait for sometime for traction . This is the stage we
find more people joining you and then go ahead and try to do with whatever
resources we have .

I still do understand where the discontent is coming from , i am living
happily in communities after communities for past 23+ years in India .
Today i will be going to two meetups with large numbers
some of them i curate some of them i be just  part of it as spectator and
give support.

Communities have a life and ways of there own ,This is one reason i love it
 as a  collective . I still feel the discontent is coming from somewhere
for the system .i for one  cannot be judging people unless i meet that
person in person  and talk about specifics otherwise i think this thread
has no more value and is never going to end on the mailing list .

I had real bad experience with ChennaiRb, the ruby community for Chennai. I
wrote a book which had a cover of a beautiful woman, and like the Talibans
people were up in arms against me for that. I fought back, that irritated
them and they found a silly reason to chuck me out. I have created my own
group Chennai Ruy programmers as alternative where it has no rules, but
none knows about it.

Ii find Ilugc far far better than those groups (thanks to good admins like
Shrinivasan T, and Madan US who really loves this group and was my boss
before), but Indian groups are for propaganda, power and mob mobilization
than about real technology.

The book on non Indian forum had earned me praises. Believe it or not many
women has liked it on facebook!! Indian men have weak and inflexible mind I
suppose.

Man, that's harsh - but it seems quite widespread in India. People have 
forgotten the more ancient history which celebrates both the male and 
female form.

After interacting with a few Indian Lug's I have to concur - this one is 
particularly well moderated, there seem some really decent people here.

I have noticed that there does seem to be a bit of a mob / power 
mentality in some groups - but I guess it's up to people to challenge 
that or just let the lugs fail. There seem to be quite a few failed / 
dormant groups too!

Personally, I will keep posting to try to "do something about it" with 
whatever time I manage to spare!

There is a solution though. One can use federated network like Diaspora,
all one has to do is to log in to a pod (server), type his / her post, add
a tag like #ilug or #chennaipython and hit send.

This will be sent to many other pods which has users listening to it.
Though one can delete comments of others in his post, he can't stop one say
posting message with tags say #chennairb

The only way to stop some one dissenting is to request every other one to
stop listening to that person, and the other one can do the same to the
person who claims he is the leader of the group. Thats true democracy
(well, a kind of).

I do have great ideas for diaspora project, if students are willing to beat
the evil social network Facebook, please do contact me. Lets change the
future.

Message-ID: <CACq+3bs=e=VFmZ9i=6xi92POeGJNx-nQPQa+c5=E8fHSK6yWRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

The meeting was started by Shakthi Kannan with his topic on Emacs Dired
mode and he completed his talk by around 4pm.

Around 10 participants were present. 4 of them from MCA (Final Year) Vels
University, Pallavaram.
We had a discussion on FOSS conf and the preliminary steps required etc.,
Students from Vels university wanted to have workshops on open source
topics during the month of August-2015. It was suggested to them to send
some select topics and tentative dates for these workshop to the mailing
list.

There was a discussion on pulling crowd to the meeting and also updating
meeting agenda in advance.

A decision was made to update the topics for the meeting before a week.

Thats all for update for now.

Thanks
baskar

    In Ubuntu, for folder comparison, you can use mc (midnight commander).
For file comparison, meld or if you want to do it from editors,
ediff(emacs) and vimdiff(vim). Thanks

I think it could be a font issue.  The font suggested by the page is 
"Uni Ila.Sundaram-10".   My computer doesn't have it.  Firefox renders 
it with DejaVuSerif,  and Chrome renders it with FreeSans. If we save 
the page and open with LO Writer,  it renders differently,  but it also 
says that "Uni Ila.Sundaram-10" is not available and will be substituted.

Maybe if you install the right fonts,  it will start to look as it was 
supposed to look.

Sahas

I just exported as PDF from LO,  and although the fonts are different 
from what Firefox uses,  the bold text remains bold in the PDF.

IMO, it will be useful to convert Word to plain text, so that you can
export it to any format in future.

Separating content from presentation will help in long-term
maintenance. Otherwise, it becomes a vendor lock-in.

I suggest 'pandoc' which can convert any type of document to several open
formats like latex which will help in long-term preservation and
maintenance.

For FreeTamilEbooks.com project, We get the content for the books as
Word Doc from authors or as their blog/site.

They will be having lot of images and bold text for heading.

It is very tough to convert to plaintext and then adding images and
bold formatting.

Here is our workflow.

We need to have the content with images, somewhere online for easy copy/pasting.

If we get as word doc,
1. open word doc in libreoffice 4.1
2. save as HTML
3. upload to http://freetamilebooks.com/htmlbooks/

Now we have html content in online.

we may get content from blogs also.

4. copy/paste the chapters in pressbooks.com
5. Give all metadata as cover image, author details etc.
6. Export as epub. mobi, xhtml  (Their pdf export does not support Tamil)
7. open Xhtml in text editor and add few CSS hacks for nice printing.
here is the css - https://gist.github.com/tshrinivasan/95ace5882cac6a1070fe
8. Open the same xhtml file in firefox.
9. Print as A4 PDF and 6 inch PDF
10. Upload and Release in FreeTamilEbooks.com site

As English Text -
https://goinggnu.wordpress.com/2014/02/01/how-to-create-an-ebook-for-free-tamil-ebooks-com/

When printing from Firefox as PDF, we loss Bold formatting.

How to fix this?

Thanks.

I tried converting two of the HTML books using cloudconvert.com (which
internally uses pandoc) and in less than 5 seconds I have got a nice
PDF e-book of

http://freetamilebooks.com/htmlbooks/oru-vasagam/oru-vasagam.html  (and)

http://freetamilebooks.com/htmlbooks/black-june-html/black-june.html

All bold characters, Table of contents, Fonts, HTML links were nicely
formatted and worked properly.

\--

With markdown, you can specify the location of the images and plain
text can be revisioned. It all comes down to how the project files are
organized. As mentioned earlier, doing maintenance down the road is
easier because you are separating content with presentation.

How often do authors change the book contents?

Greetings everyone! I wanted to share some news about a renewed effort to
restore automated installer testing of ubiquity using the daily images
generated by cdimage. Up until last cycle, the images were being test
automatically via a series of autopilot tests, written originally by the
community (kudos to you Dan!). It was noticed the tests didn't run this
cycle, and wxl accordingly filed an RT;
https://rt.ubuntu.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=26570. In short, as part of
some datacenter shuffling, we learned it's no longer possible for CI to run
or maintain the tests. They recommended we host and run them ourselves as a
community.

With the directions from CI in hand, I initially asked DanChapman and
dkessel to investigate setting up a jenkins to run these tests. But they
need your help! The autopilot tests for ubiquity have a few bugs that need
solving. You can see them here:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bugs?field.tag=autopilot
.

To help solve these bugs or to learn more, check out this document:
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-installer/ubiquity/trunk/view/head:/autopilot/README.md.
It will guide you through running the tests yourself locally. You should be
able to replicate the tests following those instructions. From there,
patches and comments on the bugs would be most welcome (as would additional
bug reports should you find them).

Even with the tests working, however, we still need to setup a jenkins to
run them. We'll also need to maintain this server. Anyone with experience
or desire in this area? Ideas for reporting results (on the isotracker for
instance) also need to be explored. This is likely to involve some python,
and potentially some web work. Is anyone interested?

If you have some technical skills and want to help out, please do get in
touch with myself, DanChapman or dkessel. The goal behind this effort is to
see these tests be useful again this cycle for image testing and lowering
the burden for manual testers.

Thanks!
