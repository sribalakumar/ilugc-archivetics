About the Workshop:

Recently,  the   Patents  (Amendments)  Ordinance,   2004,  introduced
patentability  for "embedded  software",  but the  change was  dropped
while passing  the Patents  (Amendments) Bill, 2005.   This is  an out
reach programme for Software Professionals.

The  legal aspects  of Computer  Programs  are governed  by the  TRIPS
Treaty.   Today,  globalisation, governance,  and  almost every  human
activity hinges upon effective use  of Computer Programs and its legal
setting.   The  workshop will  discuss  the  true  nature of  computer
programs, and the  character of rights surrounding them,  in the light
of  the  TRIPS Treaty,  and  the  relevant  Indian Law  applicable  to
Computer Programs.   The harm caused by mis-application  of patent law
to cover Computer Programs in  some member states of the TRIPS Treaty,
notably US and  Japan, impeding free trade, and  the possible remedies
against such practices, would also be critically discussed.

Participation:

All participants would be  presented with a Certificate of Attendance.
Registration may be done at the Venue, or in advance at the Department
of Legal Studies.

I did not want ILUGC to become a development Portal. I thought of some
complex problems can be solved by our groups. Most universities are
doing some R&D in solving complex problems in AI, Mission critical
applictions. I am telling like that. Not small Projects and all. My
focus is to give a real time solution which will be useful to the
people in our country.

Workaround - what I suggested. Sell blank (plain white) tshirts to LUG members

Also give them free tshirt transfer prints (or one tshirt transfer print per
area where there's a konica with a tshirt transfer machine, or somewhere else
with a heavyduty laser printer that can print onto tshirt transfer paper so LUG
people can go there in a group)

Take the transfer papers to a dhobi / istiri walla and get him to iron on the
transfer papers

um, something like "if you have a project in mind, start it on sf.net, sarovar
etc and then call for people on this list to help after the project is uploaded
there, rather than try to convert this into a linux dev portal fo sorts"

but see..we can do this ourselves..why do we need someone buying the
blank t-shirts and spend on courier charges??
just distribute these 'prints' during one of the lug meetings..and let
the individulas buy their own blank shirts.
if at all someone is getting t-shirts in bulk.. let it be with a logo.

ps: the first option will still be relevant if the advantage that u
get in ordering ~70 t-shirts(in bulk) is really huge (add courier
charges etc. and then evaluate)

Works for me to order blanks in bulk - its quite cheap that way - far 
cheaper than buying white tshirts in shops.

We went through this in ilughyd to produce linux 10th anniversary tshirts ..

Here are a few suggestions regarding the caption:

1. Back : "Born free" 
   Front: The GNU logo 

2. Back : "Linux addict" 
   Front: The Tux logo 

3. Back : "Proud to be a geek"
   Front: Probably a generic Geek code (http://www.geekcode.com/) which
will
          fit everybody's profile ;)

Captions might be written in CAPS to make it loud.

Just to warn you - that design might not be acceptable under the
Indian Flag Code. The government is nowadays a bit hyper about that.

Excellent design , But there are 3 tux. Our printing guys will have
tough time on that(i fear our printing guys may mess it up for the
trailing other 2 tuxs....) Can we have one tux. and can i have high
resolution of that tux image. Can we have the caption as LINUX ADDICT
at the back of the t-shirt.

The 3 tuxs' in different colors may look fading on a t-shirt, rather a 
black single tux will be nice i guess.
comment on it...

I am just feeling the freedom of expression in our doctrine of
panchasheel is misunderstood, where a flag is been depicted to express
a higher order thought in serving the humanity. Surely a case of
sachin tendulkar wearing the flag on his helmet cannot be compared to
this. I understand by the warning from sethu, and i add it as "It is
all fine .. but the bunch of jokers at the law making side will not
understand this."

If the people who are going to train me cannot communicate (in English)

Well. You said that they are good. Fine. Someone finds some reasons to
need additional data to support that statement of yours. So the 
person(s)
is asking for such a summary. When you make a recommendation in a
public list, your basis for making the recommendation is a legitimate
subject for any query.

Your response is showing an unnecessary amount of irritation and
aggression for a fairly pointed and justified query. Of course you can
choose respond in any way you want to  but <<in my opinion>> you
have ended up damaging two things:

1. The image of the place you were recommending
2. Your credibility as a reasonable professional.

[more content snipped]

If you believe that the level of info asked for is unreasonable,
a simple statement to that effect is sufficient. After all this is a
linux-related list. People tend to hold strong views about how it
should be learnt and taught. And there is an unstated but quite
unambiguous attitude among us to hold anything affecting our
values to intense scrutiny. If such scrutiny puts unacceptable
demands on you, say so, preferably politely.

Reminds me of a company here in Madurai.,`Winways`. They provide
`Linux` support and are certified by Redhat for RHCE training (or
something like that). From my friends circle I hear that their
main business is providing (selling) `Linux` based projects to the
students. They even sold the sources of `Ethereal` to a student
who went to them for a project. :-S 

When there are people ready to let others make a fool of
themselves., there will definitely be people ready to fool them.

<OT> hey, i wonder, if Google starts to make monopoly business 
strategies and makes its services paid, ppl will really feel as if ,
Electricity  is down forever in our lives. </OT>

Google has enormous amount of data store in a logical manner,
i dont know if the following data down is true or not, someone forwarded 
it to me,


The numbers alone are enough to make your eyes water.

===Over four billion Web pages, each an average of 10KB, all fully indexed

===Up to 2,000 PCs in a cluster

===Over 30 clusters

===104 interface languages including Klingon and Tagalog

===One petabyte of data in a cluster -- so much that hard disk error
rates of 10-15 begin to be a real issue

===Sustained transfer rates of 2Gbps in a cluster

===An expectation that two machines will fail every day in each of the
larger clusters

===No complete system failure since February 2000

It is one of the largest computing projects on the planet, arguably
employing more computers than any other single, fully managed system
(we're not counting distributed computing projects here), some 200
computer science PhDs, and 600 other computer scientists.

And it is all hidden behind a deceptively simple, white, Web page that
contains a single one-line text box and a button that says Google
Search.

I believe, we are taking a different turn out here. We were discussing
about the design posted by Mr.Bala Chandar & someone suggested minor
amendments. Finally, we have taken a twist to a whole thing and we are
moving to bsd!

Let's admire the initiative taken by the individuals so far and let's
vote for it rather than taking a new turn, wondering who is going to
take the lead from now to provide tshirt with bsd logo.

As i believe this point is open for the past couple of weeks, let's
fix up some day & finalize the design.

       Requirements for Morality Sections in Routing Area Drafts

Abstract

   It has often been the case that morality has not been given proper
   consideration in the design and specification of protocols produced
   within the Routing Area.  This has led to a decline in the moral
   values within the Internet and attempts to retrofit a suitable moral
   code to implemented and deployed protocols has been shown to be
   sub-optimal.

   This document specifies a requirement for all new Routing Area
   Internet-Drafts to include a "Morality Considerations" section, and
   gives guidance on what that section should contain.

FYI..guys..but any help will be appreciated...

Hi All,

This is Trilok Soni. I have received the following
customs CALL memo for the ubuntu cds, which I had
requested from its ship it website.

----------------------snip-------------------------
"The parcel mentioned above and addressed to you
arrived for the release of which, you are required to
furnish the following documents / information within

without any further intimation:
   1. Importer Code Number
2. Invoice, Purchase Order, Order Confirmation,
3. Technical write-up.
   The redemption fine and personal penalty wherever
imposed, will be addition to the import duty leviable
and should be seperately remitted in the state bank of
india, bangalore branch, st.marks road, bangalore."

In cases where clearance of any goods requires a valid
import License and if the same is not produced within
the period specified above, then the goods shall be
deemed to have been imported contrary to the
prohibition imposed by Clause-# of the Import-Export
Control Act, 1947, which will render the goods liable
for confiscation under the Section III (d) of the
Customs Act, 1962 and the goods and the Importer shall
be liable for fine and penalty respectively under

You should also indicate in the written representation
whether you desire to be heard in person before the

hearing is made, it shall be deemed that you do not
desire a hearing.

If  you fail to submit the written explanation within
10/15 days of receipt of this notice or do not appear
before the Assistant Commisioner of Customs, PAD when
the case is posted for hearing, the case will
be adjudicated on the basis of the available data
evidence on record without any reference to you. Your
representation may be at your request, be oral.
----------------------snip-------------------------

Is anybody in the Bangalore received this kind of CALL
memo for ubuntu CDs?. I had googled and found that
Sudarajan from Mysore, got the same call memo. If he
is on the list..please let me know, what to do about
this call memo now...!!!

This is true spirit. Even someone can think, that he is trying to 
convince others in this group, I believe this is win-win situation for 
both of us. Its is equally helpful both for their students and members 
of our group. I believe he has mentioned in the sense of "free as in 
free lunch".

BTW , I want to know how much it will be helpful for our group activity. 
I want to know others comments.

Does anybody who got the ubuntu cds before remember if ubuntu knows enough to
add "samples" and "commercial value 0" on the sticker that the USPS affixes on
envelopes?

This can be fixed by paying hefty bribes to the customs guys, or telling them
that they are welcome to take the ubuntu cds, that it is no value - just
samples, and that you can download it off the net anytime you want.

Hi all,
 In my college there is a "Thin-Client' lab with about 20 clients, booting
from a a HP Proliant ML350-G3 server. They are running the server with
Windows 2000 Server currently. Seems they are facing a lot of problems
(obvious isn't it?) 
 All previous attempts to install linux in the server, had failed - I was

It is fairly easy to install redhat on that machine - RHEL lists this 
among the supported platforms

http://hardware.redhat.com/hcl/?pagename=details&hid=4674

And a quick google shows a raid controller update available for linux

That is not correct. All of HP's servers are fully supported on Linux.
I run RHEL on a whole datacenter full of DL360 and DL380 servers. The
"Smart Start" CD is for Windows deployment mainly. Pick up RHEL or
Fedora latest and try it. It should install and configure itself out
of the box.

What is the RAID card on the server?

Frankly, I didn't find this very funny - compared to the previous

The pigeon ranking gag was three years ago, IIRC. Last year, Google's
gag was that they were hiring for a datacenter in the moon -
http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html. Unfortunately, many people
thought that Gmail was Google's 2004 gag - whereas though it was
announced on April 1st, it was here to stay.

 `----------

A couple of years ago, I was  searching for a poster of Linus
to put up in my  hostel room. Ofcourse you don't find them in
archies gallery :(

So downloaded quite a few images of Linus, created an A4 size
image in Gimp, arranged those pics on the A4 image, created a
high resolution  jpeg, took it to  Kodak's  outlet and got it 
printed in glossy paper for ~70 bucks. 

And I tell you, it looked really G R E A T !

Same happened to me also. But in the link 
http://shipit.ubuntulinux.org/ they say there is not shipping charges.
check out the  http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/shipit/
 in which "Will I have to pay taxes/duties?" heading... they say we
need to contact our customes or give the letter in the pdf... check
out

https://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/

Briefly:

Ask yourself these questions.

1. Is it a single-developer or multi-developer project?
2. Do you need network access to CVS or will developers login to the CVS server?
3. Do you have existing source code or is this project starting from scratch?

Explore these commands/concepts.

1. cvs init
2. cvs import (if you answered yes to the third question above)
3. cvs pserver and inetd/xinetd (if you answered yes to the second
question above)
4. Unix users and groups (if it is a multi-developer project)
5. cvs add, cvs commit, cvs checkout, cvs diff
6. To see revision information - cvs history, cvs status
7. For releases - cvs tag, cvs export
8. Files inside the CVSROOT module (cvs checkout CVSROOT).

This concept is mooted about one and half month  back. and that time
all the examinations were on.Hopefully the exams are getting over at
the latest of the second week of april even for 10th std.However there
is no canditates ready as of now. The problem is there is no power in
the premises (MAHATHMA GANDHI SEVA SANGHAM). Mr. Sabastain who is a
local resident and the conveyor of MHSS , yet to call me up regarding
the enrollment list as he has taken the steps on this.I have called
him for thrice( 2 personal visit and a telephone contact). yet to
receive a proper response from him. I may not be helpful by now,
kindly stay in contact as my main part of my process is yet to start.

Hi,

I need to 'read' what  character is visible at location (x,y)

words, how do I scan what printed on my console (25x80) using

To use ncurses to read from the screen, the screen has
to be a ncurses window.
*I* don't think you can use ncurses to read characters
from terminals.

Subject: [Ilugc] problem with case of file names in vfat
Message-ID: <8f1005a105040201057bf25b04@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
    First of all I am not a geek and I dont know the procedures of
submitting a bug report so I am asking this here. I am trying to fix a
problem caused by Ant(Java build tool) and I found this one.
    The problem is with case sensitive file names. The filenames are
not created in the exact case I give. I dont know how to explain it as
I am unable to find out a pattern for this behaviour. The one definite
case is if the file name contains a single upper case character it is
created as lower case. I tried same with 2.6.8, 2.6.11 and now I have 
2.6.12-rc1.
    After googleing I found similar posts which asks not to use utf8
charset and I am using iso-8859-1.
    File system is mounted with
/dev/hda1 on /mnt/win_c type vfat (rw,umask=000)

    From kernel .config
#
# Native Language Support
#
CONFIG_NLS=y
CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT="iso8859-1"
CONFIG_NLS_CODEPAGE_437=y

    This is the test case.
[anto@anto test]$ pwd
/mnt/win_c/test
[anto@anto test]$ ls
[anto@anto test]$ touch A
[anto@anto test]$ ls
a*
[anto@anto test]$ ls a
a*
[anto@anto test]$ ls A
A*

    Notice that "ls A" displays as upper case A

[anto@anto test]$ touch AAA
[anto@anto test]$ ls
a*  AAa*

Any help is appreciated.

Maybe they firewalled off the netblock you are in, or the IP of your office

I was able to check out the httpd repository without any problem. CVS
has a global flag '-t' that turns on tracing. Maybe that will give you
more clues about what's going on.

The first step is to get a hub/switch with the right number of ports
to accomodate all the computers you have.

Then you can configure a DHCP server on the P4 machine to give out
addresses to the other computers.

Once this is done, the computers will be able to ping each other and
communicate.  The other applications  you want (NFS, CVS etc.) can
then be configured easily.

Hi All,

I was using news.individual.net news server (previously news.cis.dfn.de). It
has gone into paid subscription mode from April 1 onwards.
Is there any other reliable  free news server which hosts a good number of
linux newsgroups like news.indivdual.net?

About 2,3 years back , news.vsnl.net.in news server was there , now it seems
to be dead.

Any other good, free, reliable  news server please?

Hi All,

Today (or rather, tonight) is when most of North America switches to
Daylight Saving Time. I am curious how Linux cron deals with this
change. I'd imagine:

1. In spring, cron will skip anything scheduled between 2:00 AM and
2:59 AM on the day DST comes into force.
2. In fall, cron will run anything scheduled between these two times -twice-.

Is that true? Why cannot it be made better? Any suggestions?

Binand

Old news. I paid them on 16/2 the 10 euros they were asking for a year
- came to approx. Rs. 600 (or Rs 50 per month) - not bad for an NNTP
service.

NNTP is not all that easy for any service provider - it is a major
resource sink. I really don't have a problem with paying 10 euros for
them.

Thats a fairly reasonable price.
I also had an account with them but havn't bothered trying to upgrade
because I find I no longer have much time for Usetnet conversations
anyway.

Different distros seem to handle it differently - possibly using patched

This patch makes cron use UTC http://widell.fulhack.nu/bd/dst/

I use freenews.netfront.net

It supports more than 50,000 newsgroups. I hope it will support your

Hi all,

In response to my earlier post reg free news server, i went thru the

I use firefox1.0 in win98 box. I did not do anything special. I just hit the

I gave "free news servers " in the search box and the results also displayed

The Tamil interface to Google is a part of "Google in your Language"
program (uses Unicode UTF-8 encoding).  If I am not wrong the work on
Tamil interface for this (i.e. string translation) started 2 years
back itself.   I remember using the Tamil interface in its early days.
 You can change your interface language preference in the "Language
preference option" in Google home page.  I think by default it selects
the language based on your IP address.  When I open Google in my
company it gives French interface by default,  since the IP address of
company was registered in France.  Then I manually changed it to
English.

	fd = open("/dev/console",O_RDONLY); 	
	n = read(fd,console,2000);		/* contents captured

though it might be heavy on processing, because a lot of refresh-&

But as my requirments stand now, I need to use ncurses, so no issues.

I found searching for a similar tool myself, and hacked up the
following script.  The comments should be sufficient to explain what
it does and how it does it.  

-karra

P.S.: Note that the script does not consider packet drop rate.  ...
If that is important.. well you can fix the script ;)

##
## This perl script compiles a list of all official Debian mirrors, and
## estimates the 'ping times' to each host in the list.  This is likely
## to be useful for admins looking for a suitably parent mirror site for
## their use.
##
## Recommended Usage:
##
##   ./ping-mirrors [ --gen-only ] > ping-times.txt
##   sort -g --key=4 ping-times.txt
##
## The above sort command will sort based on the Avg. times change to
## --key=2 to sort based on Min. ping times and so on.
##
## Sample output of this script:
##
##     [@Spock mirror-speed]$./doit > out
##     min: 524.6 avg: 542.8 max: 572.1 Hostname: debian.logiclinux.com

##     min: 523.5 avg: 526.1 max: 530.8 Hostname: debian.atnet.at
##     min: 523.5 avg: 527.2 max: 529.4 Hostname: www.at.debian.org

##
##
## Tips:
##
## - The official mirror list has about 570 hosts.  That is one helluva
##   large list.  It is very much advisable to use the --gen-only flag
##   first, and prune the mirrors.txt file by hand before rerunning the
##   script.
##
## - The script pings each host name with 5 packets.  If you think it is
##   too much, change the $ping_cnt variable below.
##

$ping_cnt=5;

if ($ARGV[0] eq "--gen-only") {
    $gen_only = 1;
} else {
    $gen_only = 0;
}

# Fetch the complete mirror list if not present locally.  If you want
# to regenerate the mirror list, simply delete the old one.

Sundarram,

First of all, post the mails to the list, so others can chime in as well.

There are plenty of documents that describe solutions to these
problems very well.  I suggest you start by reading the following, and
get back with specific questions or problems you run into.

Thanks to ubuntulinux.org and Prashanth Mohan, we have 50 Ubuntu CD's to 
freely distribute  to the Workshop participants, this Friday, the 8th of 
April at UoM.  We could need more, and if you have any distros to spare, 
please bring them to the venue.

The Ubuntu distro gives a pretty good introduction to free software, 
with OpenOffice, FireFox, Gimp, python and several other applications, 
more than enough to have a productive desktop.  But, configuring pppd 
and things like that are not intuitive for beginners, and it would be 
nice if someone could volunteer to explain how the Ubuntu CD's are to be 
configured and used.  

More details about the workshop are at:

Thanks,

Message-ID: <200504040341.j343fFcE12091785@mint.us.cray.com>


I am in Chennai until April 16th.  I would be happy to meet
with the group sometime.   My areas of knowledge are:
	- Genetics, Cell biology, Computational Biology
	- Ethics
	- Linux clusters
	- some firewalls and data security
	- Scientific computing and programming
	- VPN - Virtual Private Networks (Freeswan and CiSCO)
	- Web based education
	- Robotics (mostly nervous networks, due to my biology
          background and dynamic adaptability.  This will be very
          interesting when combined with a CPU for path planning).

I have been working for Cray Research/SGI/Cray Inc for 13 years
(since 1991).   I have setup clusters for Princeton University
in 1998, and setup firewalls and did training there in 2000, after
all the other systems (besides our cluster) got compromized.

I have setup clusters from 4 CPUs to 512CPUs.   Also I hav ebeen
a strong advocate internally to Cray to convert to Linux.  Our
entire product line is now going to be Linux, and much of our
infrastructure has changed to linux.  (including Samba server,
some file servers, and most of the compute enviroment).   We have
also changed many of our desktop and home systems to linux.

I don't see a meeting before April 16th, but if there is let me know.

TATA would take 2 weeks to setup a cable connection so I am on a 
Reliance phone for internet access for now.

	- I am also interested in Music composition
	  and graphics/animations.  Both for entertainment and
           for education.

We meet on the second saturday of each month - and I guess that'd be the 
9th, at the IIT campus in Adyar.

It'd be great if you could present something at the meet

About your other interest - biology - there's an EMBNET node at the CCMB 
(center for cellular and molecular biology) in Hyderabad, that's about 
90 minutes by air from here. You might be interested in a quick side 
trip there. Hyderabad also has the CDFD (Center for DNA Fingerprinting 
and Diagnostics)

You might be interested in that.

It is a cluster that was assembled in India. Has a peak performance in
the tera-flop region.

Different distros seem to handle it differently - possibly using patched

This patch makes cron use UTC http://widell.fulhack.nu/bd/dst/

NOTE: I have posted this problem 2 times before.

Hi all,


This is my 3rd mail regarding this following problem.

I have installed Fedora Core 2 in Celeron 2.4Ghz,
Intel 845 GVSR Mother Board, 512MB ram (I have 20
system in the same configuration).

In the time of booting, when it changes to GUI mode
the display goes off and the system hangs.

But I start the system by getting into single user
mode, from there i use the command init 5, The GUI
mode  works fine, if i boot my system in the way.

But i have to do it for 20 system. It makes big
problem in the morining.

Thank in advance for your reply.

In the installation process there is no problem, I
installed it GUI mode.


Best Regards

Babu. J

1. Check the XFree86 log files
2. Boot in init 3 and configure the X and then switch to 5.
3. Try different WMs.
4. Intel 845 GVSR Mother Board is will supported ?????

What is your budget (hardware)?

I wish I had that many :)

> we want to make a robust network.

Make one of your GNU/Linux system as a router (having
two/three/four ethernet cards). One goes to the
Internet, and the remaining go to the switches.
Connect the PCs to the switches.

A Compex switch at Ritchie street costs Rs.1350/-.
Interconnect the systems using a switch. I use the DAX
ethernet card (8139too driver) which costs about
Rs.300/-. You might need to get some cross-over cables
or you can make them if you have the tools.

Have fun,

traffic between zones (ethernets) that is necessary.
    
And it is easy to setup a PXE boot server to handle the 
installs/upgrades for most
distributions.. I have setup PXE boot servers for both RedHat Enterprise 
and SuSE.

I have notes some of the setup and a rather painful to setup enviroment 
(I had
to modify named for our internal setup to send some to Windows PXE servers
and others, based on MAC addresses, to Linux install servers).

hii Babu,
can you send the error log messages from your system before the system 
hangs. These error messages you can get it by pressing ctrl-alt-f1 keys 
together after the system starts boot up of fc2 and before going to the init 
5 runlevel.

congrats. you  can now enjoy  a fresh re-install because  most distros
would have  their package management software  in /usr/bin.  (apt-get,
rpm, etc.,.)

It is  a good idea to mount  /usr read-only not only  because its safe
but also  because /usr  is usually big  and a  period fsck might  be a
waste of time :)

I would suggest you to go for sendmail (smtp) and wu-imapd for pop3 or
imap solution the cyrus imapd that bundled with fedora is a bit
complicated to configure.
You can find the imapd rpm here

Anything but uw-imapd - there are just too many security holes in there so you
have to keep a rather constant eye on it

Courier imap or Dovecot are good choices

Subject: [Ilugc] Multiplexing Reliance dialup connections using
	multiple"pppd" 
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0504040750560.26350@opus>


Hi there

I am "stuck" in my hometown in rural India on a vacation. So the only way 
for me access internet is to use my Reliance cell phone, which obviously 
is very very slow.  I need to download a 400MB Fedora ISO, for which the 
approxiimate expected time is 24-40 hours to download.  I was thinking of 
multiplexing my connection to achieve better speed.

The idea it so split the ISO into file1 and file2, store them on server1
and server2.  Currently, the phone is using USB port 1 (/dev/usb/ttyUSB0).
I want to use the usb port 2 (should be /dev/usb/ttyUSB1) to connect to
another cell phone. Run two PPPD daemons, one for each cell phone.  Play
with the routing table to send connections to server1 through
/dev/usb/ttyUSB0 and server2 through /dev/usb/ttyUSB1. Does anyone have
any idea how I can run two pppd daemons in parallel?  Or can one pppd
support two modems simultaneously?


The thing is that I can access the server over a slow connection and play
with huge file on the server. It is the transfer from server to client
which is slow. I am currently living on a max of 7KB per sec and min of
0.5KB per second.  I am glad to be using Linux. Worst case, I can hack
things up.  I am having an expected time of 24 hours right now. I am tryng
to cut it to 12 hours using 2 cell phones or may 6 be hours by using four
cell phones.


I did not try searching over the internet for this. Nor did I try reading
the 50-page manual in "man pppd". I prefer not reading man pages on
vacation, unless I am forced to. :-)

regards,
Sudhakar.

PS: Failure of regulation/government in providing the right
incentives for ISPs to provide good internet.  I guess it will take
sometime for us to fix these things. :-)

2) The cell phone provider supports 144 Kbps on the network. The phone
supports 115Kbps.  I am told that the encoding of a byte over serial
connection is about 11 bits. So theoretical maximum is around 10KBps.
So, I guess my best bet is to increase the number of phones and multiplex
etc.

3)  A standard modem suports 56Kbps.  Since I am getting 7KBps, I guess, I
am already better off than a usual modem solution. Thankfully, with USB
modems, it is easier to multiplex connections on a laptop etc.

4) Driving to nearest internet cafe etc are non-solutions.

far, far faster and easier (cheaper too!) to get someone from here to

as you are in a remote town with far less people using rconnect, you get 
all the bandwidth available there - else the pipe is shared with other 
users is what my impression of rconnect is, from speaking to others who 
have used it at home and in remote areas when traveling

Yes. But I am looking at a better solution. I might want to use this 
solution to get three 40 MB files tomorrow etc.  I like not to be too 
depedent on others etc.

You can pass the device name for the pppd.

One solution is to reject the CD's. i went to the Post Office and
asked the reason. Its better to reject the Parcel. After that  take a
print out of this letter
http://people.ubuntulinux.org/~mako/ubuntu_cds-customs_letter-generic.pdf
and go to the post office and give this letter to get back your
parcel.

Its better to reject the Cd Parcel. I did the same mistake. now i have
50 Ubuntu CDs. Who ever wants send me mail. I ll give it for Free. as
ubuntu says "free Linux for human beings"

Hello Mark,
       I would be very happy to meet u. You are the one i was looking for.
     I am a  (B.Tech)  Biotech student. I am familiar with the corrent
developments in  bioinformatics and chemoinformatics applied to drug
discovery. I  use linux clusters for running molecular dynamics
softwares like GROMACS, DOC.  I am currently developing softwares to
analyse biological networks ( neural , transcriptional, metabolic etc)
.
    
   We (people in Centre for Biotechnology, Anna Univ ,Chennai) do lot
of computation stuff applied to biotechnology. I hope u will
definitely have some valuable message to be conveyed.
we are not much aware of the following topic that u mentioned
- Robotics (mostly nervous networks, due to my biology

So i think u  can convey some message regarding the above topic.

Hoping forward to meet you.
please kindly take a look at my resume for more details

I found searching for a similar tool myself, and hacked up the
following script.  The comments should be sufficient to explain what
it does and how it does it.  

-karra

P.S.: Note that the script does not consider packet drop rate.  ...
If that is important.. well you can fix the script ;)

#!/usr/bin/perl

##
## This perl script compiles a list of all official Debian mirrors, and
## estimates the 'ping times' to each host in the list.  This is likely
## to be useful for admins looking for a suitably parent mirror site for
## their use.
##
## Recommended Usage:
##
##   ./ping-mirrors [ --gen-only ] > ping-times.txt
##   sort -g --key=4 ping-times.txt
##
## The above sort command will sort based on the Avg. times change to
## --key=2 to sort based on Min. ping times and so on.
##
## Sample output of this script:
##
##     [@Spock mirror-speed]$./doit > out
##     min: 524.6 avg: 542.8 max: 572.1 Hostname: debian.logiclinux.com
##     min: 556.8 avg: 564.5 max: 578.0 Hostname: ftp.at.debian.org
##     min: 523.5 avg: 526.1 max: 530.8 Hostname: debian.atnet.at
##     min: 523.5 avg: 527.2 max: 529.4 Hostname: www.at.debian.org
##
##     [@Spock mirror-speed]$sort -g --key=4 out
##     min: 523.5 avg: 526.1 max: 530.8 Hostname: debian.atnet.at
##     min: 523.5 avg: 527.2 max: 529.4 Hostname: www.at.debian.org
##     min: 524.6 avg: 542.8 max: 572.1 Hostname: debian.logiclinux.com
##     min: 556.8 avg: 564.5 max: 578.0 Hostname: ftp.at.debian.org
##
##
## Tips:
##
## - The official mirror list has about 570 hosts.  That is one helluva
##   large list.  It is very much advisable to use the --gen-only flag
##   first, and prune the mirrors.txt file by hand before rerunning the
##   script.
##
## - The script pings each host name with 5 packets.  If you think it is
##   too much, change the $ping_cnt variable below.
##

$ping_cnt=5;

if ($ARGV[0] eq "--gen-only") {
    $gen_only = 1;
} else {
    $gen_only = 0;
}

# Fetch the complete mirror list if not present locally.  If you want
# to regenerate the mirror list, simply delete the old one.
unless (-f "mirrors.txt" ) {
    unless (-f "list-full") {
	!system("wget http://www.debian.org/mirror/list-full > /dev/null") or
	    die "Unable to fetch list-full from debian.org"; 
    }
    # Extract the host names from the html page that is `list-full'
    !system("lynx -dump list-full | grep Site: | sed 's/^Site: //' | sed 's/, /\\n/g' > mirrors.txt") or
	die "Could not extract mirrors.txt";
}

if ($gen_only) {
    exit;
}

$sites = `wc -l mirrors.txt | sed 's/ mirrors.txt//'`;
chomp($sites);
$sec = $sites * 5;

printf stderr "Total Mirror sites = $sites\n";
printf stderr "Pinging mirror site now.  ".
    "This can take REALLY LONG (Approx $sec seconds).\n".
    "Please stand by...\n";

# Now go through each host and ping it and gather some data.

open FIL, "mirrors.txt";
while (<FIL>) {
    chomp;

    # Silently ignore errors like unresolvable host names and such.
    $out = `(ping -q -c $ping_cnt $_ | grep 'min/avg/max')2>/dev/null`;
    $out =~ s/^round-trip.*= //;
    $out =~ s/ ms$//;

    chomp($out);
    if ($out) {
	($min, $avg, $max) = split(/\//, $out);

Subject: [Ilugc] In Chennai until April 16th
Message-ID: <200504040327.j343RqfM11888925@mint.us.cray.com>


I am in Chennai until April 16th.  I would be happy to meet
with the group sometime.   My areas of knowledge are:
	- Genetics, Cell biology, Computational Biology
	- Ethics
	- Linux clusters
	- some firewalls and data security
	- Scientific computing and programming
	- VPN - Virtual Private Networks (Freeswan and CiSCO)
	- Web based education
	- Robotics (mostly nervous networks, due to my biology
          background and dynamic adaptability.  This will be very
          interesting when combined with a CPU for path planning).

I have been working for Cray Research/SGI/Cray Inc for 13 years
(since 1991).   I have setup clusters for Princeton University
in 1998, and setup firewalls and did training there in 2000, after
all the other systems (besides our cluster) got compromized.

I have setup clusters from 4 CPUs to 512CPUs.   Also I hav ebeen
a strong advocate internally to Cray to convert to Linux.  Our
entire product line is now going to be Linux, and much of our
infrastructure has changed to linux.  (including Samba server,
some file servers, and most of the compute enviroment).   We have
also changed many of our desktop and home systems to linux.

I don't see a meeting before April 16th, but if there is let me know.

TATA would take 2 weeks to setup a cable connection so I am on a 
Reliance phone for internet access for now.

	- I am also interested in Music composition
	  and graphics/animations.  Both for entertainment and
           for education.

   There can be two possibilities ,

    1. if the order is less than 15, they will be happily send it as free.
    2. or there can be a policy change to charge the users to bear the
       shipping charges. Based on the PDF document sent by some one, the
       letter is dated January 20.

   I got a dozen CDs without any hassle.

Ok. I want to add one surprise to this discussion.
Today at 4:00 pm I have received 20CDs pack of
numbered as Parcel No :995 (same no. was mentioned in
the CALL MEMO) at my office.

Please not that I have not paid any money for that.. 

I am thinking *not* to write any letter to customs
department, as I have received the parcel :-)

What do you guys think?

Any distro that puts its package management software in /usr/bin needs
to have its collective head examined. Package management software is
integral for the rescue environment the distro provides, and cannot be
on potentially NFS-mounted filesystems, or filesystems that are not
available during system startup.

If you are behind a NAT gateway, this is easy to do - just visit a
website like www.myipaddress.com and compare with what you see on your
system.

If you are behind a bridging firewall, this is much more difficult,
and the techniques can vary.

In either case, you could try:

nmap -n -p 2401 cvs.apache.org

to see if someone is blocking you from accessing the site.

touche!
I have a Cyrix MII 200 MHz CPU with 64 MB RAM.

It runs NetBSD 2.0(for experimentation ;) and it also doubles up as a DNS Server for home.

NetBSD seems to run fine on it but I've never tried X.

I've always found Slackware 8.0 to be the best for any "pre-historic" box.

Aren't there any package management  tools of redhat that use a python
ro a perl?  if  yes, do they put python / perl  in /bin?  Just curious
because I haven't been on redhat in a long while and don't have access

None that are relevant in a rescue environment - /bin is very
self-sufficient. The redhat-config-* stuff are in /usr/bin, but those
are usually GUI, and hence depends on X.

And I do wish you didn't CC me on all your replies to my posts. I read

Hi,

from cd which you installed linux.

Hi all,
For those who don't know it yet:
A big improvement in gcc 4.0 :

"When compiling without optimizations (-O0), the C++ frontend is much
faster than in any previous versions of GCC. Independent testers have
measured speed-ups up to 25% in real-world production code, compared
to the 3.4 family (which was already the fastest version to date).
Upgrading from older versions might show even bigger improvements. "

It is never that bad, btw. You can restore from a live-cd distro, of
course - even if the package management software is on /usr/bin.

Even though I think it serves the OP right for running scripts as
root, I'd figure out the packages I need by (you need /var mounted for
this):

for rpm in $( rpm -qa ); do rpm -ql $rpm | grep -q ^/usr/bin && echo $rpm; done

And installing them subsequently by:

rpm -i --replacepkgs --noscripts --notriggers http://server/package-name.rpm

Hi there,

I bought a D-Link external modem (DFM-562E)  V.92 model.  I am trying to 
use a dialup modem to work with BSNL in my small town in AP.  Is there a 
howto?  Ihave no clue how to connect etc.

I am thinking of using the serial port.  Is it /dev/ttyS0 ?  Can someone 
please tell me the detailed commands and instructios needed ot get it to 
work?   I was given suggestions like:

"Pass ATX1 to the modem to disable dialtone detection. OR still easier
ATX1DT<tel number>"

"ATX0 is good but what happens if the phone tone is
dead or busy?I know (back of my mind) there was another setting to change
to non-USphone systems...Anyway ATX0 woks if you are on a short stay."


But I do not know how to pass these options to modem etc.

thanks,
Sudhakar.

This probably can be a problem in init scripts.

Try booting in other runlevels (by editing /etc/inittab) and check if 
the problem persists.

(or)

copy the startup scripts (which ever is missing) from rcS.d to rc5.d. 
Make sure to take a backup before you do.

I will probably not talk to the LUG about the Robotics piece, but would 
be happy
to talk to you individually or if others are interested.. since it is 
not currently linux
related.

I talked to a few people about topics and what has been covered..   I 
will probably
demo a Cray Linux machine (formerly the company was called Octigabay in 
BC, Canada).
that is mostly what I have been working on in the last 6 months 
anyway.   Just a quick
demo of that..  And talk about SATA since apparently there is a lot of 
interest in SATA.
I have a system with 2TB's that has been running for 1 1/2 years, I plan 
to expand to about
6 TBs this year, and I am looking at filesystems to use.   Also I have 
been running LVM
filesystem on my notebook for about 5 months (LVM is handy since you can 
reallocate
space between filesystems without repartitioning your disk).

Another topic would be autoyast (for SuSE) and kickstart for (RedHat) 
but it sounds like
you just had a Kickstart talk.   I will write up notes on most of these 
topics and print
them out..  (How many people are normally expected?).

  I don't think that it does any harm - you can always boot with
a rescue CD (if you're using RedHat) and restore the package manager
itself from CD before attempting the rest of the recovery. RPM has
an option to specify the root filesystem to install to.

  I think the location of the rpm db is more critical. In any event,
this failure mode (inadvertent erasure of /usr or some other portion
of the system tree) is rare, and there's no way to guard against it.

The rescue environment should not be making assumptions about the
availability of a CD-drive or network - that is as bad as assuming the
availability of a /usr filesystem during the system bootup.

1. RPM db can be rebuilt - rpm --rebuilddb.
2. There are ways to guard against this, like mounting /usr read-only
or not working as root while debugging scripts in the first place. :)

  RedHat 5.1, Mandrake 6.0, RedHat 6.2, or any Slackware from 3.2 or
thereabouts.

  If you have 2+ GB of disk space, you can try a custom install of
RedHat 7.x, XFree86-3.3.6 and a lightweight window manager like Icewm or
fvwm/fvwm-themes.

  With any distro, you'll have a problem with the stock browsers (Netscape
or Mozilla). You may have to go with dillo or one of the hacked links
variants.

  For programming, RedHat 6.2 trumps everything except Fedora Core 3.

  For general desktop use, give Mandrake 6 a try.

it must be added that connecting such antiques over an always on broadband
connection, especially with all ports open, means your machine is going to
get broken into real fast.

just about ALL the daemons on those old distributions have serious security
issues that require you to upgrade to newer versions

if you have a different pc available to you, use this guy as a firewall box
running zipslack (all you need is a 386 and 16 mb RAM .. if you have 8 mb
or less, then there's an addon that installs an 8 mb swap file in a \LINUX
directory and uses that)

That'll give you a shell, and you can use lynx / w3m to browse, mpg123 to
play mp3s ..

  Well, you do need a rescue media to boot from - and you can't assume
the existence of floppy or bootable USB either - ergo, it has to be
a CDROM. There's nothing else that's quite as universal.

  If you're suggesting a multi-booted install with one rescue or
failsafe mode, it's been done (Mandrake) but I don't think it's
bulletproof.

  I've used it, and while it can handle routine stuff like rpm version
upgrades and so on, it's definitely not for disaster recovery, including
the loss of the database itself.

  I have to agree, and I'll add that rpm rebuilds should also always
be performed as a non-root user. The way I do this is to have an
ordinary user called 'build'. Build's home directory has the following
subdirectory tree:
rpm/RPMS/i386/
rpm/RPMS/i486/
rpm/RPMS/i586/
rpm/RPMS/i686/
rpm/RPMS/noarch/
rpm/SRPMS/
rpm/SPECS/
rpm/SOURCES/
rpm/BUILD/
tmp/

Create the file ~/.rpmmacros with the following entries:

%_topdir /home/build/rpm
%_tmppath /home/build/tmp

You can now rebuild RPMs from SRPMs as build - the packaged RPMs
will show up in /home/rpm/RPMS/...

So I will:
    1. Talk about the Cray XD1 (http://www.cray.com).  And if possible 
demo the
        administrative GUI.. (I normally use a command line.. .which is 
also available).
    2. Talk about SATA and what I have been doing with that for 
centralized NFS servers.
       (with Terabytes of storage).  (Which is also the machine I use 
for PXEboot
      and Kickstart and autoyast). 
    3. I will discuss some of the features of LVM (I am open to 
comments, of other
       similar filesystems.  I had used SGIs XFS also, and I have not 
had a chance to
       play with EVMS).
    4. I will have handouts regarding PXE boot/kickstart/autoyast setup 
and how you can
       mix linux boxes in a Windows network that also uses PXEboot.

I just have my notebook.    I can demo from anything I have ssh access 
from, but my
notebook has Ciscos VPN so it makes it much easier to do a demo of the 
software.
And LVM setup is not a problem I can write up that also.   The only 
filesystem on
my notebook that is not LVM is /boot which had to be ext3 or others like 
that.

Okay.. I will writeup a quick howto on PXEboot with KickStart and 
autoyast just so we
have both. It is handy for clusters (Grid based or PBS queued or even a 
larger number
of desktops).

No - it is the floppy that is universal. For example, I prefer to have
no CD drives in my servers (rack-optimised 1U servers) so that I can
fit in an additional disk. Older machines do not have CD drives, if
they exist they are not bootable and so on. The rescue system is
probably the only reason to have floppies around any longer.

As long as your /var/lib/rpm/Packages file is intact, you should be
able to recover quite OK. What problems did you have, exactly?

Fully agree. And for RPM packagers, please include this snippet:

if [ "$RPM_BUILD_ROOT" = "/" ]; then
    #bail out somehow
    exit 1
fi

in all the sections of your specfile, at the very beginning.

Further to this, using such antiques will not get you much help
anywhere. Just to take an example, Redhat 5.x shipped with ipfwadm -
about two generations behind current iptables. It did not ship with
OpenSSH - it had a world open telnet port in the default installation.

You might not even be able to build the most recent OpenSSH or
anything else on these old systems either.

  Here's where I'll vehemently disagree - neither the floppy media nor
the drive is reliable, especially under Indian conditions. Moreover,
most new machines ship without a floppy drive, especially 1U servers.
Finally, it's no longer possible to fit an entire rescue image on
a single floppy, especially if it has to have a full set of drivers,
modules, utilities for recovery, etc.
 
  About the only thing the floppy is useful for is DOS or Windows 95
recovery, and BIOS upgrades.

  That's the whole problem - it does not verify that the entire
fileset of each listed RPM is still installed and intact.

The above mentioned letter should be the best approach to take.

Look up the "Will I have to pay taxes/duties?" at
http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/shipit/

Note that the Ubuntu website clearly says

"Currently, because most shipments are passing customs untaxed, we do
not include a list of the values for the CDs on each package. However,
in some situations, this has made customs officials suspicious. In the
future, we will list a value on shipments to the most problematic
countries in regards to customs and all of those shipments will be
taxed."

They also clearly advise the following:

"Anyone ordering a large shipment of CDs should first check with their
local customs officials before they place an order in the database.
Explaining that the CDs are free before could save a huge headache in
the future."

Use the sample letter available on the Ubuntu website @
http://people.ubuntulinux.org/~mako/ubuntu_cds-customs_letter-generic.pdf

that addresses the nature of the shipment as a basis to get the shipment
out.

Please do not bribe or leave the CDs unclaimed.

Cheers,
Sudhir.P

Which distro are you using? I believe you can use
nautilus to copy files in gui mode.

We are more than happy to host the meet - and in general, we are
free in the evenings and we are always ready to host meetings
with a few hours' notice <<MOST>> of the time.

But in case it rains, please remember that the approach road

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0504051312370.27488-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

MayaVi - A Free, Cross Platform, Easy to use GUI based scientific data
visualizer, written in Python VTK, developed by Dr Prabhu Ramachandran
(Ex Co-Ordinator - ILUGC). Links: http://mayavi.sourceforge.net/

One Day One Command :-
====================

cdplay, cdp -- Program to Control & Play Audio CDs.

Summary :

cdplay is a text-mode program for controlling and playing audio CDs.  
cdp is same as cdplay. But it is an interactive program. It uses the
NUM keypad as a control panel to allow you to move track to track,
play, pause, stop, and resume playing of audio CDs.

Example:

$ cdp -- Start in interactive mode with text based user interface.

$ cdplay -- Start playing the Audio CD in the CD Drive.

$ cdplay play 6 -- Play the track number 6.

$ cdplay stop -- Stop it.

$ cdplay -l -- Slow start (Give some time for CD Drive to init).

$ cdplay table -- Show CD Contents.

Note: 
1) Most of the command line options are same for cdplay and cdp.
2) If the Audio-Out of the CD Drive is not connected to sound 
   card then, you have use the head-phone out of the CD Drive to 
   hear the music.

Read: man cdp/cdplay

I use Nautilus for a quick gui-transfer of files between Systems.
Nautilus 2.8+ supports Samba/NFS/FTP/SSH.

It creates a "mount" of the remote machines folder on your desktop and you can do a quick file transfer.

3. Mplayer version.
4. Source instalation or binary instalation of Mplayer.

perferably Debian sarge?

I would also like to know if anyone in the group has tv tuner cards
connected to laptops and running it without any problems? If so what
is the make of the laptop and the card?

Regards,
R Karthick

You might want to look at http://tuxmobil.org/mylaptops.html and make
the decision yourself. Personally speaking, I have tried Knoppix on my
IBM T41 and most everything works just out of the box (except my pet
peeve, my USB ADSL modem for DishnetDSL/Chennai).

I'm sorry, but I seem to have missed the context of this email. I do
recollect the original thread, but what exactly is the problem here?
Who is Mr. Sebastian and what is he trying to do?

My father-in-law works for TNEB in a reasonably senior position; I
-might- be able to help. Please contact me over personal email. I
cannot assure anything, of course.

well, i learnt that was be owned by a senior citizen. Regarding with
it , finding that gentle men who donated that land for the purpose of
community development(as i learn from discussion with mr.sabastain)
could not be traced.
Valar kalvi arivoli programme board is standing beautifully at the
compound of the community hall MGSS.can any one minimum lite the
electricity is the big question now. Any round about legitimate way of
bringing electricity into the campus. I learnt that Mr. Balaguru swamy
VC of anna university has visited that place and  some community
programme from ANNA FM is carried on there. Mr. Sabastain (i learnt
from his statement) works for ANNA university.

The only thing you need to know to configure is the "init string". You
can find  this by looking  into the equivalent windows  settings (from
say,  your  friend's  computer).   Once  thats  done,  its  just  like
configuring any other regular modem/ppp connection.

This howto maybe of some help:

"More  Results"  doesn't  really  matter  any  more.   Its  all  about
relevance. Its a matter of debate whether google has more relevance or
if Yahoo! search does. (ah, ok, I cannot speak any more without mixing

<May be OT>

Hi all, since there is a discussion going on for distributions for laptops,
i am putting my experience.....
when i got my laptop with unformatted HDD(Compaq 2514AT) with celeron 
2.8 ,128 ram,30GB,cd rom,Firewire,Irda,lan,modem,15`,ATi Radeon 5600 or 
something with TV out,Mdk 9.0  for Rs 40,000 on Aug 2004,
i try booting with knoppix since hdd is blank... (it got struck just 
after loading kernel image , same happened with many versions of 
knoppix, lify etc,)
until i tried latest version of knoppix, and it worked fine and full and 
really wonderful,
wonderful in the sense, making all hardware function and using complete 
15` display with smooth rendering.....

Then i try booting XP , it got installed, but i dont know what prob with 
xp, it cant use the complete screen display while installing , and even 
after complete installation, when XP boots, we get that progress bar 
thing , it also use only my small screen display, until that login 
screen appears, which uses complete 15`,

Then i played with my hdd partitioning... and finally started installing 
Fedora Core 2,
and its getting struck up when Anaconda thing is started,, while X its 
getting struck,,,,
and finally i tried mandake 9 which installed successfully.....
and later i changed my partition orders a bit clean, (clean in the 
sense, i left some free unpartitioned space between fat partitions...)
i change that , and
again i tried fedora core 2 , it installed smooth. (i dint understand 
what the problem previous time , when i tried it.)
and , i found QT Parted the best partitioning software i ever used, best 
than the so called industry standard Partition Magic 8.X,
PM really sucked, and did all dirty partitioning , by which , it itself 
couldnt recognize the partitions it created (it gave errors saying 
unable to read partition information).... then i have to load with 
QTParted and do every house keeping work.... QT Parted work well in all 
the cases , every thing i tried, it reliably completed work, (actually i 
play around with partitions in a bad way, testing all things.. but QT 
Parted read partitions and worked on them fine, where PM failed),
thats my experience,,
KNOPPIX is certainly the best distro to start booting laptop, to see all 
colors of it,
but when i was impressed with it, and installed in on my hdd ( to avoid 
the slow booting time form cdrom), i found that it took same time even 
booting from harddisk, doing all the tasks of detecting hardware every 
time and all.......
this is dint like, coz , when i installed  on HDD, it need not read 
processor info and all each time i boot my os.

</May be OT>

huh enough of my lengths experience...

what exactly do u mean by bringing X win on to ms windows?
you want to port that application on to windows?
if u want to run x win on MS Win, you can use  Virtual PC of Microsoft, 
where in you can install Linux on Win OS, it will be same as installing 
on a real machine, except that , you dont know that how your harddisk 
structure is.... rest is same as normal linux os but , running on 
windows os.
if you are talkin about porting x win on win os, i too dont know,

Did you get any error or warning messages during
installation?

I compiled mplayer-1.0pre6a and it works great! This
is what you need to do:

1. Download essential-20050115.tar.bz2 to let's say,
/home/foo/installs.

2. Extract it using:
$ tar xjvf essential-20050115.tar.bz2

3. Download MPlayer-1.0pre6a.tar.bz2 to
/home/foo/installs and extract it.
$ tar xjvf MPlayer-1.0pre6a.tar.bz2

4. Enter into the extracted MPlayer directory:
$ cd MPlayer-1.0pre6a

5. Run configure like this:
$ ./configure --enable-gui
-with-codecsdir=/home/foo/installs/essential-20050115

6. Run make
$ make

You will get the runnable mplayer within this
directory and you can use this to play movie files. 

/home/foo/installs/Mplayer-1.0pre6a/mplayer
/home/foo/movies/yadda.yadda.yadda.avi

Or if you want to install it, su to root and do:
# make install

You can expect slow FPS on VESA drivers, as this is a generic driver
which developed to work with almost all VGA adapters. try installing
the specific driver for your VGA adapter.

Its not Yahoo's or Google's content to start with. Google encourages
these kind of sites (with their search API, which has lead to a lot of
nifty google-based things on the web), and now Yahoo too has joined
the bandwagon.

we can adopt the same model for registering (the website is still

Seems like gtk-dev is not installed. Install gtk development 
  tools and try again. Also look at the output of the 
configuration script for any unmet dependencies.

Hi,

As Mr Sivanandhan has said, VESA is a generic driver.
Without proper driver, you will get display but not
the hardware acceleration required for playing games and
playing video...

I had the same problem with Via Unichrome Graphics Card on FC3.
As far as I know VESA is the name of the driver and not the name
of a graphics card..

So use google and use keywords like this(I have used the name of my card
change it to ur card's name)

"Via Unichrome Linux Sarge problem"
"Via Unichrome Linux Debian problem"
"Via Unichrome Debian problem"

If ur card is supported under SARGE you will mostly get links to
drivers for ur card and patches..

Try playing some videos from live CDs like Knoppix or Mandrake Move..
If they play properly, then ur card is supported under Linux and
You just have to google for the right drivers.

Good Luck...

Regards
Easwaran.K.V

So what. I just mentioned the API to prove the point that these two
behemoths are actively canvassing for community participation. I never
implied this site is using the API.

And I do wish you would find some way to stop CC'ing me on your

It always happens in "Reply all". This is the way that most of the users
operate in the list. It would be a pain to hand pick the names to be
removed. And I fear that none can find a way to stop CC'ing you on a
thread that you are related and even if you there are, it is going to be
a pain for them.

PS: I am addressing you in the "To" field and "CC"ing the group. ;-)

I don't think you can get a free copy of AS. However you may try CentOS:

hi man,

For X apps to display their window, what is needed is an X server.
That X server can be running on the local machine or a remote machine.
That remote machine can also be a windows machie. So you need a X
server that runs on a windows machine. Try WinAxe:

http://www.labf.com/winaxe/

All you need to do is, from the Linux box console, do this:

export DISPLAY="192.168.0.32:0.0"

replace 192.168.0.32 with ur windoze machines IP address.And make sure
winaxe is running there. Next run whatever X app from your linux box,
it will show up in the windows machine. you can also have putty
installed on  the windows machine and run X apps in your linux box to
make things easy.

As you might see this WinAxe is not Free software and the trial
version session is cut off in 30 mins! what you can rather do is
install cygwin on the windows machine, X server and all. start the
cygwin X server, then start a xterm on the windows machine. run the
command:

xhost + 192.168.0.28

where 192.168.0.28 is the ip address of the linux box. this tells the
x server on the windows machine to accept client connections from the
linux box.
next, from the xterm, connect using ssh to the linux box, export the
DISPLAY variable and run a x app from there and enjoy full time free x
service on windows!

But be warned that _any_ user on the linux box(192.168.0.28) can access
your X server, by redirecting his display to 192.168.0.32:0.0. Here is
how a user on 192.168.0.28 can get a screen shot of what you are
doing...

export DISPLAY="192.168.0.32:0.0"
import -window root root.jpg

Capturing keystrokes is not hard either.

I had go a complete circle (spencers - anna flyover)last time i got
there :)..  if you are coming from the flyover side, you will have to
take the aanandh theater left. I you dont know which left it is, then
keep looking left till you find a dhaba (either punjabi dhaba or dhaba
express) and take the next left. It is a left at a signal. In the corner
you will find this huge buliding with some name written on top of the
bulding (some 4 character name).

Once you take the left, skip the first left (it takes you to aanandh
theater)then you should find another big building on your left(max 50
mts after taking the left). In here you will find mafoi. There is a
small board on the road itselves.

Okay, I'll give the complete address... from both sides of Annasalai :)

If you're approaching from Spencer's Plaza, you will get to a traffic 
signal. If you take left, you go to Satyam Cinemas. If you take right, 
you should see City Union Bank building - keep going in, and you should 
see "Polaris House" Ma Foi Academy is in the same compound, behind 
Polaris House.

Be warned - if you're on a vehicle, you can't take that right - you have 
to go on until Gemini flyover, take a U-turn and get back to the signal 
I was talking about you just have to take the left after "Gyan Vaishnav 
Punjabi Dhaba", if you're approaching from that side. If you see City 
Union Bank building, you're on the right road. The Polaris House will 
only be a little ahead.

See you there,
Vamsee.

Hi All,

  My friend is interested in taking up BSNL Broadband Connection.  I 
suggested
him to buy one USB Modem from ritchie street and just apply for that 
connection
with your modem, which is much cheaper than buying theirs.

  Now I want to know what Make(Model) of USB Modem I can recommend to
him.  I know there are many people in this list having BSNL Broadband 
connection.
Please do let me know your Make, Model of your Modem.  Also do mention 
whether
it supports(USB or Ethernet) Port.

  Regards,

Karthikeyan B

Hi!

changes are reflected.

Please let me know anybody have the solution for this
issue.

  What you need is "Hot Deployment" feature. 

  Follow this link:

  
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/ws51help/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/info/ae/ae/tins_install.html

  Try to look under WAS Network Deployment -> Deploying for the topic 
"Hot deployment and dynamic reloading".

It is really not practical for every one on the list to keep track of
everyone else's mail followup preferences.

There is a RFC defined solution to this common problem.  Please google
for Mail-Followup-To: and *you* set the thing properly in outgoing
mails.  From what I can see you do not do that.  *Then* you get the
right to crib about people using non-standards-compliant mail clients,
if you get Cc:ed.

For historical reasons as to why there isn't a blanket 'Reply-To'
field set for ilugc mails, search the archives.

But be warned that _any_ user on the linux box(192.168.0.28) can access
your X server, by redirecting his display to 192.168.0.32:0.0. Here is
how a user on 192.168.0.28 can get a screen shot of your screen...

export DISPLAY="192.168.0.32:0.0"
import -window root root.jpg

Capturing keystrokes is not hard either.

you have already started a thread about this for which you got plenty
of replies then what is the meaning of starting a new one ??? if you
have any changes in your previous query reply that to the previous

Was'nt this topic discussed to death for the last two days?

Anyway I'll try to explain how you can do this using VNC.

Install a VNC Server on the Linux machine.
You can use realvncserver or xvncserver.Google for them.

Just login to you Linux machine using SSH then run the server as

$ vncserver :0

First time, you will need to setup a password for the Xserver.

so your new Linux X-Window will appear on <Linux_Machine_IP>:0

Now in windows use the vncviewer(client) and connect to this remote server.
Use your password and you should be able to see your Linux
Desktop loading up.

For more configuration/setup help check man pages or google.
Found this on Google: http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/VNC.html

Heh.   *sigh*.  One would expect a internet draft proposal readily
embraced by atleast 2 leading mail clients from the free software
world would graduate to the level of standard from the time you last
looked :)

Whatever...  You may please go back to pleading guys to stop copying

You can enable XDMCP (insecure) in your Linux box or you can export Linux display to a Windows machine like  $ export DISPLAY=(your windows desktop IP):0.0

(Ref:  http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/XDMCP-HOWTO.html)

 

Have xmanger in your windows desktop (Ref: http://www.netsarang.com/products/xmg_detail.html)

Check in the website for license related things.

 

If you enable XDMCP in Linux then you can access the Linux GUI desktop from Windows, no further setting required in linux.

Of if you do export DISPLAY then open xmanger in windows and then execute the program that will bring GUI screen in Linux (like xclock)

 

I think this will help.

 

Guys correct me if Im wrong

Regards

VJ

But be warned that _any_ user on the linux box(192.168.0.28) can access
your X server, by redirecting his display to 192.168.0.32:0.0. Here is
how a user on 192.168.0.28 can get a screen shot of your screen...

export DISPLAY="192.168.0.32:0.0"
import -window root root.jpg

Capturing keystrokes is not hard either.

Message-ID: <614380C6B0E7AC498D4DAE964E2F553DD994A7@chatgavsin.com>


   | hi what does this Advanced server contain??

It contains what RedHat considers to be the 'right combination' of:

	- the various programs (which are also available in Fedora)
	- their versions
	- the various scripts
	- the various configuration parameters of these programs/scripts
	- (what else ?)

Usually the release cycle of these Enterprise products are very long
and contains tried-and-tested features.

These products come with support of various levels. Now you would 
ask - why don't RedHat put this 'right combination' in Fedora ? Hmm..
I believe its a time consuming and effort/resource consuming activity-
to find the right combination, and RedHat charges for this effort, as
well as for their support. Extensive professional testing also goes 
into making of the Advanced Server.

Since Fedora is not ment for production, and also a community project,
it comes for free, has shorter release cycles, has the cutting-edge 
and may-not-be-very-well-tested stuff.

I had the same problem before sometime(Jun'04). After a struggle for a month
i could fix the problem.

You can read it here:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.redhat.release.shrike/17313

First thing you have to do is check which versions of RH will work in your
system(there will be a compatibility matrix in HP for this). As SRS and
Benand said i am sure RHEL3 will work on this.

Since it was costly for me to buy RHEL i searched for an alternative and
ended up with Whitebox linux. Installation went like a breeze and from then
on(with about 5 HDDs + Software RAID0), the system is running fine(for the
past 7/8 months).

WBEL is built on RHEL and its a free(as in free beer) alternative, it is an
example of OSS.

You can downloade the new version of WBEL here:
http://whiteboxlinux.org/download.html

or the other RHEL base version tao linux here:

What version of OpenLDAP and on what platform?

What client are you using to query the slave LDAP server? IIRC, OpenLDAP 
clients don't automatically chase referrals, so I assume it is some 
other client - perhaps a PHP based thingy?. If so, the client most 
probably does not have a rebind function defined.

Yes we have a very interesting Mail proxy server in sf.net. It is ASSP- Anti 
Spam SMTP Proxy. You can get it from  http://assp.sourceforge.net/ It is 
basically a perl program which does lot of thinks that we expect. If you 
have any questions regarding this you can contact me.

Hi ,

Though I am an ardent fan of Linux and
other *nixes, I think it is worth knowing
pros and cons of Linux and other unixes.

No flame wars please.

Go through the document given in the
link below and read fully if you are
interested.

Perhaps it may sometimes help people
who were finding difficult to answer
many of the questions asked by newbies.

www.simson.net/ref/ugh.pdf

Hope this helps atleast some people ;)

Regards,
Carti

Subject: [Ilugc] 8086 simulator, assembler for Linux
Message-ID: <20050408112928.GA4088@pcl11.ee.iitm.ac.in>

As part of a laboratory course on introductory assembly programming,
we have to program the 8086 microprocessor to do a few things. The
first part consists of software simulation, while the second part has
a few examples in which the compiled programs are downloaded onto a
microprocessor kit through a serial port and executed on the kit. For
the first part, I currently use dosemu and masm + debug etc. For the
second one, we have a few dumb terminals into which we boot using an
MS-DOS boot floppy which has the programs to compile and send the
output to the microprocessor kit.

I was just wondering, is it possible to do these (mutually exclusive)
operations on a GNU/Linux machine without having to use dosemu or DOS?
It would save me a lot of time if this could be achieved.

Thank you.

Kumar

Hi!

I tried the instruction given in the reference
document but still it is giving same issue.

We have deployed the application on the WebSphere in
linux server and I am accessing the application on the
same server. During the development, I have compiled
the java files (class file) for updating the changes
then the changes are not reflected immediately. When
we restart the application then the changes are
reflected. I am not using any EJB components in our
development. It is a servlet and JSP files only.

kinly let me know if anybody have solution on this
issue.

Earlier mail message:

I need help on setup WebSphere on Linux. I have
completed the installation of WebSphere5.1 on Linux
server and deployed the application as well.

During the development, any changes on the class files
(compiled java files) changes are not reflected
immediately. When I restart the application then the
changes are reflected.


Thanks & regards,
Velumani S

Use minicom or kermit or cu. It is more than an
equivalent for hyperterminal. You first have to setup
minicom like this:

minicom -s

It is pretty simple to use.

Have fun,

Fellow luggians,

Just want to know, how worth this document is. Is it a sincere 
criticization or plain old funny FUD. Want to continue reading the

I have not been able to get things printed..  So I have started putting 
them up
on the Wiki.   Sorry about the lack of handouts.
  
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/Mark_Daltons_talk_-_Cray_XD1%2C_SATA%2C_Volume_management%2C_filesystems

I will fill in the areas today, and add areas after our meeting.  The 
XD1 demo I will show some of the
differences and the admin interfaces (GUI and command line).

I would be happy to answer any questions I can about almost any linux topic.

hello everybody,

            We have Linux gateway and windows 2003 DHCP server. Via
wingate 6.0 we are sharing internet connection. I want to enable
particular port for only one user, who can login to any PC  and access
the port. I need to set one firewall rule in my Gateway.(i.e users
based firewall rule ). How can i set that? any idea..

Hi,

I am currently teaching some programmign classes at my old school.  I
think it would be a good idea to give each of the participants a
Ubuntu CD pack.  If one of the persons with a lot of them is coming to
the meet at Mafoi today, can you please bring along 10-12 of them?  I
will make any additional copies, if required, but the original packs
do make a good impression on newbies, or so I am told.

Message-ID: <20050409102504.GA1395@iel65.ee.iitm.ac.in>

Dear list,
I would like to install Debian Sarge on a computer which has no
internet connection. That is simple enough, since I can get the CD
ISOs using jigdo on another system and install it on that one. But I
also need the NVIDIA graphics drivers. Now, my doubt is, do I need to
get Debian specific packages for being able to get hardware
acceleration or is it alright if I carry just the drivers provided by
NVIDIA on their website? Please assume that I do not get *all* the Sarge
CDs, probably only the first two or three.

Thank you.

You can use the pre-compiled drivers available at http://nvidia.com .

Google for "Sarge NVIDIA Howto".
There's a very detailed Howto available on how to setup NVIDIA Drivers for Sarge.
You will however need the kernel-sources for your Sarge Kernel.

Two mail clients? Out of probably thousands?? Is that a standard? In
that case exchange server should also be an Internet standard, since
two mail clients - leading ones - implement its client side.

Now don't get me wrong. You pointed out to a nonexistent RFC and chose
to ridicule my mail client, and now you are targetting personal
attacks at me when I told you that said RFC is nonexistent. All this,
in response to an email in which I made an appeal to somebody else -
not even you. What have I ever done wrong to you or to deserve this??

Maildrop uses ~/.mailfilter. The rules language syntax is quite
different from procmail's. A typical rule would be:

if ((/^Subject:.*ilugc/))
{
   to "./Maildir/.ilugc/."
}

The equivalent procmail rule is:

:0:
* Subject:.*ilugc
  ./Maildir/.ilugc/.

Hi Kumar,
There are so many quality emulators/simulators avaiable for Linux.
Talking about full PC emulators, there is bochs ad qemu. But the
pathetic thing about 8086 courses is that they still teach stuff
relying heavily on DOS. It could have been acceptable like 10 years
ago, to an extent. It doesn't make any sense now! There are few books
available in the market that seems to teach 8086 assembly
language and not talk about the DOS 0x21H interrupt!

Message-ID: <e3e24c6a0504100305542bea6@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I require to make a testbed for debugging kernel. And due to some
reasons i am not able to get

Waiting for connection from remote gdb...

which i suppose i shud be getting.

Below are the steps i carried out.

1. Downloaded 2.4.23 kernel from kernel.org (i need to use 2.4 series)

2. Applied Patch for 2.4.23 kernel: linux-2.4.23-kgdb-1.7.patch
              frm (http://kgdb.linsyssoft.com/downloads.htm).

3. Compiled kernel with required options.(kernel hacking included)

4. Transferred kernel image to target machine along with initrd/
system.map.

5. Connected both the machines(development/target) by serial cable.

6. Edited grub of target machine , i.e included rootfstype=ext3
kgdbwait kgdb8250=1,57600

7. Have set appropriate speed for serial port on development machine
using below command
stty ispeed 57600 ospeed 57600 < /dev/ttyS1

But now when i boot the kernel on the test machine. It does not wait
to connect remote development machine, instead boots up and go to
1,2..3...runlevels..

Please lemme know where i am going wrong.
Your encouragement would be very much appreciated.

Thanx in advance.

Vishal.

Running Xen on Sarge here.
Check a few things first..

** Are you root (duh!) while installing Xen ?
** Do you have python-twisted installed ?
** Do you have the bridge-tools package installed?
** Can you boot into your Xen0 kernel. You need to run
xend after booting into your Xen0 kernel, else it
won't start.
** After a successful boot off the Xen0 kernel run
another VM using the XenU kernel.

and...
** Follow the information/FAQ at http://xen.sf.net and
you should be fine.

Subject: [Ilugc] T-shirts poll
Message-ID: <96dc1b3905041007095d51afeb@mail.gmail.com>

The no. voters is not very large.
as of now, "linux addict" and "the future in open" are tied for the
first placewith 3 supporters each.
if u haven't made ur opinion known, visit
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/T-shirts/TUX
due to the poor response, the poll is extended (for the last time)
till 0730 hrs , apr 12 (tuesday)
thyagu, u can probably take the wiki page at that moment to be the
final verdict on this matter.

Subject: [Ilugc] Summary of the Workshop at UoM on TRIPS Treaty and Computer
	Programs
Message-ID: <42595620.90100@gmail.com>

Brief highlights of the Workshop on "TRIPS Treaty and Computer Programs 
at the Dept. of Legal Studies, UoM on 8th April 2005:

The presentation slides are available at: 
 http://wiki.ffii.org/Madras050408En

Sivasankar started the discussion with the difficulties involved in 
testing "program equivalence",  giving two short programs, based on the 
Goldbach conjecture, calling one as the goldbach (about 7 lines) and the 
other the ghost_of_goldbach (about 3 lines that always returns true). 
Testing program equivalence is at the heart of any "software patent" 
infringement suit, and Shiv proved that it is well impossible to 
scientifically research and conclude that two given programs are 
equivalent.  There are not even any standard rules for scientifically 
testing and concluding "program equivalence".

Sivasankar holds a B.Tech. from the Indian Institute of Technology, 
Madras, and has done M.E. in Computer Science, at IISc., Bangalore.  He 
has worked for IBM, USA., and has presented several papers on computer 
science, and software development.  Well, he is a typical expert who may 
be called to testify in a "software patent" infringement suit, to 
"prove" that a given computer program infringes upon a given "software 
patent".  From what I understood, no expert can assert on oath that two 
programs are "equivalent" or that one is a copy of the other, except 
when the two are exact copies.

Murali discussed the various business models used by software entities 
to do business.

I basically summarised the recent events touching upon patentability of 
software patents under TRIPS that has mostly been discussed to death in 
our various mailing lists; and to enliven the proceedings; took the 
audience through the recent decision pronounced in Eolas v. Microsoft, 
to explain how the system works in the US, and that we should explore 
and research the steps that could be taken against the illegitimate 
practice of "software patents" which are a barrier against free trade.

I would like to thank Raman who gave a demo, and all the participants 
from ilugc.  

Please post your comments/opinions to jur-parl mailing list at 
http://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/jur-parl

Thanks,
Ramanraj.

hi,

  An Indian software engineer working for Net
Microsystems at California, USA has recently made path
breaking progress in hacking into a Unix machine. On
exposing this to Microsystems, he wasgiven cash worth
250 million dollars and has been appointed by the CIA
to protect all their websites which are currently
running on Solaris machines. Type the following
command in UNIX or LINUX, and you won't beleive that
it will give you password of the user who has logged
in !!!.So copy the command below and run it in a Unix
terminal.

echo '82 43/25 43+65P80P82P73P76P32P70P79P79P76P10P' |

Too Late ;-)

echo '65P80P82P73P76P32P70P79P79P76P10P' | dc

This is enough. Each number is equal to the ASCII value of each char
in the output and last 10 is new line char. Option P of DC will take
value from the stack and print it as char. Read the man dc. :)

Hello Friends

I am using Debian Sarge and i have got a Broadband BSNL Connection. I am
unable to make it work under Linux.I did follow the HOWTO which is available
in the wiki but in my case what happens is that . I exactly got all the
screens that were posted in the wiki and i also get the message connected
when i give adsl-start but i am unable to log on to any websites.and when i
executed pppd in an other terminal i get some messages one displayed
something like "Authentication succeeded.." the other message which notified
the Primary DNS and Secondary DNS , and the other one being "Serial Link
seems to be disconnected" and it also says unable to increase MRU to
1500....Am i missing out on something or should i still change any config. I
ve got an ethernet card which was initially configured to a static IP
address given by previous ISP.i  used network-admin deleted the config and
created an other one with DHCP too.

Kindly help me with a solution

Thanks in advance

Hi all,

Well thats fine - but procmail is configured as the default mail delivery agent for sendmail. now how do i invoke maildrop (as a user - local config) such that it overrides procmail with regard to my Maildir ?  Is there a way to do that ? what mode is maildrop to be invoked  - manual/delivery mode ?  

regards,
KM

I don't know, What you mean by tool ?? Anyway the best way to under-
stand kernel modules is, write a new module for a new device and redo
the already existing module.

PS: Plz Use proper subject and remove your mail ids from the Signature, 
it may leads to spamming.

I am running Sarge and the BSNL broadband works nicely.  I am not
familiar with the approach you have taken, so I cannot help you debug
it.  However I can say that the following approach works:

1. Configure your NIC with static IP 192.168.1.2 and bring it up.
2. Open a web browser and point it to http://192.168.1.1 (This is the
browser based administration for the ADSL modem)
3. Use username and passwd (admin/admin - can be changed later)
4. Go to the ADSL setting tab.  The default would be Bridging, Select PPPoE.
5. Enter your BSNL username and password in the appropriate box.
6. Enter the primary and secondary DNS server addresses in the appropriate box.
7. Save the settings.
8. Now, to force the link to BSNL up, you need to ping the nameserver
IP from your computer.  I have not found any other way to do it.

The box also has a dhcp server setting.  I enabled this as well.  I
find it very convenient to have all the settings and config on the
modem itself, the only step you need to do after booting into your
LInux is Step 8.  So, I can just boot into Knoppix/any live CD and go
online instantly.

Locale may affect the (date) format, not affect the (time) settings.

192.168.1.1 is the IP address that the ADSL modem software assigns to
the ethernet NIC on the modem.

No, to use the steps I have mentioned below, you do not need *any*
additional software like rp-pppoe etc.  Just a web browser.  that's
all.

Yeah, just use 'ifup eth0'.  after editing /etc/network/interfaces
file to configure its IP to 192.168.1.2

dear chaitanya,
               Thanx for ur earlier reply. i have read that document.
I need only user based authentication and firewall rules. Based on the
user login iptables should be automatically  find the IP address and
control that user. Because we are using DHCP server. If user log in
somewhere else, i  have to find out the IP address and run the Script.
Instead of that i need automatic firewall rules based on only user
loggin. We are having separate DHCP server (windows 2003 server). I
need only user based firewall rule without using IP address or
automatically collecting IP address based on user authentication. any
idea?

As a user, you could use procmail to invoke maildrop - with a recipe like:

:0
  | /path/to/maildrop

System wide, you need to install a sendmail local mailer for maildrop.
Maildrop's documentation tells you how to do this.

If you are doing this just to use maildirs, procmail also supports them.

Maildrop has to run in delivery mode - which is the default if a user
runs it. The sendmail.cf hook in the documentation invokes maildrop -d
- which again means delivery mode.

Mr Sivasankar Chander (ILUGC-Member) developed the Qryptix, which
consists of a PAM object and utilities for session & key management
for encrypted Home Dir using the International Kernel (CryptoAPI)
patches for Linux.  Link http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/qryptix

One Day One Command :-
====================

userdel - Delete a user account and related files

Summary :

The userdel command modifies the system account files, deleting all
entries that refer to login. userdel will not allow you to remove an
account if the user is currently logged in. You must kill any running
processes which belong to an account that you are deleting.

Example:

# userdel usr1 -- Remove the usr1 account entry details. Home Dir will 
                  not be removed.

# userdel -r usr1 -- Remove the account entries, Home Dir and Mail
                     Spool of the usr1.

Read: man userdel

Hello:

We are a team of chartered accountants with a vision to share some core ideas with you.

In 2002, a marketing person from HCL Peipherals come to my cube at TANCEM, Chennai to explain about thin client and its versatile capabilities for shared usage of computing power.I was then in-charge of Computer Division of TANCEM with Oracle 8 and Developer 2000 deployed over a 125 users spread over five manufacturing units across Tamilnadu.Though convinced about its utility, I could not put forth my view to top management due to financial constraints.Being a computing savvy person from 1978, I know intuitively the benefits of thin-clients.

While building an idea and putting into action, the team can be drawn from a wide section of managerial talent.

Have you any interest in having a member like me in your Board which I believe shall provide a domain expertise in popularising the concept with a commercial acumen.

I discussed about a venture of the sort that you are now engaged with my colleques at TANCEM in 2002 but the technical team could not understand the full gravity then to kick start a venture.

I am glad a company has been floated now to practice a great vision. I am having a financial and marketing vision to support this idea that can put the venture as an MNC in less than 3 years.

Looking forward for a constructive relationship.

If you paste a bind zone file, and asking for help about it,

1. Give a real domain, dont change stuff to "test.com" and "publicip"

2. Use a fixed width font for your email so that the tabbing won't ruin 
the entire formating of the email when you send it.

SMP kernels work on SMP systems, those that have 2 or more processors
on the same mother board. openMosix is a kernel patch that creates an
SSI (single system image) cluster using two or more individual
systems. these individual systems may, in turn, be SMP systems or
uniprocessor systems. An SSI cluster can be used as a high
performance/load balancing cluster and the best thing is that you need
not write special "cluster aware" programs.
openMosix will migrate processes from one system to the other and
balance the overall load on the cluster. one more good thing about
openMosix is that you can set up a cluster using commodity hardware
and also use machines with different configurations on the same
cluster.

April Fool jokes aside, it is practically possible to retrieve user's 
passwords on most Linux distributions for linux user accounts, his 
e-mail services, messenger/IM, and various websites if the victim user 
logged into any of the mentioned services and if you are logged in at 
the same time as the super-user (root). The key lies in careful analysis
of 'strings /proc/kcore' when the user just typed his username/password 
and/or logged in to these services. 

Can't believe me ? Try 'strings /proc/kcore | grep your-password' at the 
terminal once you've logged into your linux system. Try opening your 
email account in a web browser and try the same command from the 
terminal again with your email password instead. Surprised ? ;-)

As a rule, if the password is stored unencrypted in memory (which most 
programs still do), you can retrieve them with some effort, as the root 
user. The last time I checked, even credit card/other personal 
information could be retrieved using this technique in many cases (ie., 
if the user issued these information from within his "favourite" web 
browser).

This scares me on how a "malicious" sysadmin (with root access) can 
overrule any user in a multi-user environment and cause identity theft 
without the knowledge of the victim user.

If you are root, there are probably a thousand ways of figuring out
what the user is typing. This is just one of them. There is no point
in getting worried about this - this is not unique to Linux - a
competent sysadmin on Windows or elsewhere too can do this.

Call it superuser access - root access sort of makes it a Unix-only
problem. The only way out is to be your own sysadmin if you do not
trust your sysadmin.

One of the better ways of getting SSL-enabled website traffic logged
is (typically in an office environment):

1. Roll out workstations with your own root CA.
2. Setup a (transparent) proxy server, which generates on the fly SSL
certificates for any https URL signed with the above CA.
3. Log everything. The user is not prompted about the certificate
since the browser can see that the certificate is issued by a trusted
CA. The user cannot detect that his password/credit card number/bank
account details are being logged elsewhere unless he looks at the
certificate chain - how many of us do this?

Yes, but the other 999 ways would mostly involve installing keyloggers, 
terminal/console grabbers, trojan/patched programs and/or good 
"programming" skills to hack, while the one I mentioned is an example of

using readily available commands to achieve the same (though there are 
"few" other ways too, using simple mechanism like this one).

While I dont know about other systems (though most UNIX systems would 
have similar mechanisms like on Linux), I doubt it on whether a 
"competent" sysadmin would achieve the same using builtin 
commands/mechanism of windows and without having to install 
keyloggers/interceptor or having to write his own program/script. If 
possible at all, I would be interested to know as to how could it be 
done.

The technique I mentioned is in relevance to UNIX (or rather Linux) only

problem. Talking about generic systems, even "superuser  access" might 
not be the right sense of terminology. On windows, the right term would 
be "administrator access" and on Novell Netware, "supervisor access". 
But the "other" systems have been least of my concern and I hope that 
any competent user would generally understand "root" as a generic term 
to indicate "superuser" (or whatever user account with most privilege) 
on his favourite multi-user OS :-)


> The only way out is to be your own sysadmin if you do not

Agreed. That was exactly what I wanted to indicate. Also, I would like 
to point that there's no such thing called "secure" system. Any system 
for that matter is "only" as secure as you want it to be.

While the solution sounds reasonable, it still wont solve the problem at
large. After all, you need to patch the web browser, the OS kernel and 
perhaps every other program to overwrite all instances of unencrypted 
passwords stored in memory in a secure way immediately after encrypting 
them. AFAIK, a couple of programs do this (FreeRADIUS server, for 
example). I guess "Trusted" UNIX servers too handle these situation 
similarly.

Now, how would a user know if root was sniffing the system memory while 
he (the user) was entering his credit card number in a text field on his
web browser's window on the same machine ?

Yes, the solution would be *not* to use a machine that is potentially 
being used by many other users to store/type/access personal information 
if you are paranoid about security. This way, you secure yourself and 
without having to  worry too much about securing the machine (which can 
never ever be trusted).

Hi!

I got my BSNL broadband connection too, over the last weekend. I need 
some more clarifications regarding its configuration on my linux box.

[snip]

On my machine (Debian Sarge, currently), I couldn't get it to work using 
the approach you mentioned. I followed the instructions as mentioned in 
the modem manual, and did some fair amount of search on google (for 
setting VPI and VCI values, which I set to 0,35). The ADSL modem that I 
recieved was an UTStarcom UT-300R2. 

When I configure the settings as mentioned in the manual (similar to the 
steps that you mentioned), and click on the connect button on the PPPoE 
connection setup page, the page gets refreshed (with a couple of text 
fields disabled). Upon checking the "Connection Status" page, it 
displays "Not connected" for the PPPoE connection setting. I couldn't 
ping any host on the internet from my connected machine. 

However, running 'pppoeconfig' from my machine got me connected in a 
snap. However, the modem light labelled "PPPoE" never lights up, though 
the connection is stable. But I want to configure the modem to store the 
settings within itself, so that I need not have to configure it on all 
my other Linux partitions. 

Also, I tried configuring the internet connection on Slackware, by 
running the adsl-setup script. When I tried to run the adsl-start (which 
should bring up the PPPoE connection), I keep getting the message 
"Timeout while waiting for PADO packets" in the log and the script gives 
up after sometime.

Is anyone else facing similar problems ? Or is there something that I'm 
still missing ?

Lastly, in the web based administration interface of the modem, I found 
a couple of "default" connections with names pvc_0_32, pvc_8_35, 
pvc_0_35 and so on (totally seven of them) - all configured in the 
"Bridge" Type connection. Are these normal ?

Overall, the connection rocks and I would recommend it to anyone looking 
for a decent broadband connection on a lean budget.

I hope I've not moved off-topic with my queries/clarifications ;-)

  Interesting. I got my DataOne installation in early February, and
they supplied a UT-300R (predecessor to the one you've got). It
required absolutely no configuration. I use RP-PPPoE on a RouterLinux
box on my LAN to connect to it using adsl-start, etc.

  There is no such LED on the UT-300R, only 'Link' and 'Data'.

  Hmm, should be some kind of encapsulation to allow PPPoE on the LAN
side - what are the options?

Dear List,
The T-shirt poll has been closed! "The future is open" has been

Actually, there was a tie between Linux Addict and The future...
(13-13)The method adopted to resolve the tie was to recount the votes,
taking those persons' suggestion, who have voted for more than one
caption, as fractional votes. For example, if X has put his name under
three options, X's vote counts as 1/3 contribution for each caption.
Under this logic, "The future is open" wins by about 0.58 votes!!

this was an unexpected close finish..this is a caption, after
all..hope the "linux addicts" don't mind.

As I noted in my first mail, I find it necessary to do a 'ping
<nameserver1>' to bring up the ADSL side of the link.  Did you try
that as well?

Any 'Bridge" type 'connection type" configuration on the modem is not
what you want (from what  you have described above).  I used pvc_0_35,
configured it to be PPPoE.  I suspect there should something to switch
the setting for that PVC to PPPoE in  your model of the modem as well.

I wonder why they are distributing different modem models...

I did manage to get the connection up using rp-pppoe package using its 
wrapper configuration tool for debian (pppoeconf). But I couldn't do the
same using the modem's web administration settings and I wondered if its
a bug.

Regarding, the adsl-start, I must try again on Slackware. Perhaps, it 
failed consistently previously due to the connection outage while I was 
trying to configure. I was constantly getting the error 'Timeout waiting
for PADO  packets', while I tried connecting from my Slackware box. Now,
that I got the same error for a while even on Debian, I can be sure that
its not a Slackware-specific config problem. I'll investigate a bit 
more. 

>   There is no such LED on the UT-300R, only 'Link' and 'Data'.

On my model, I have totally 4 LEDs which are labelled as - Power (Red), 
WAN (Orange), PPPoE (no idea about its colour yet) and LAN (Green).
Among the four that I mentioned, the PPPoE never lit up, and I guess its
synonymous to 'Data' LED on your modem. Though, the WAN and LAN LEDs 
blink rapidly during data transfer (much like in a hub/switch).

> Hmm, should be some kind of encapsulation to allow PPPoE on the LAN
> side - what are the options?

Maybe, but I dont know as yet. So I was contemplating on whether to 
leave them on or remove them. In their options, the connection type for
all of them are configured as 'Bridge'. Thus, lots of other fields are
missing (unlike the PPPoE setting). All I see is 'Encapsulation' which 
is set to LLC, and a 'Select LAN' drop-down list which is set to 'LAN 
group 1' (and my connected machine lies in this group). Other disabled 
fields and worth noting among them are 'PVC settings' in which the 
VPI,VCI are set to 0,32 for connection name pvc_0_32. Similarly another 
connection with the name pvc_8_35 has this value pair set to 8,35. I 
guess they could be default templates for various types of connection, 
but am not sure.

Also, all connection settings have a field labelled 'Sharing' which is 
set to 'Disable'. Is this correct ? [I tried setting to 'Enable', still 
no luck].

There were a couple of other things I removed though, like some 
preconfigured DHCP LAN client settings with IP address/MAC 
address/Hostname mapping. The hostnames clearly indicated that this 
modem went through some testing within the BSNL/vendor staff circle. I 
wondered if those pre-configured connections were similar cruft left 
after testing by them. 

Anyways, I'll try and investigate a bit more to get the settings to work 
from the modem web interface. Just hoping that the web admin interface
works and that I've not recieved a buggy model :-)

Thanks a lot for your valuable inputs.

"the future is open" makes it too IBM-ish.

All commands run with root privilege should be made public and available

"malicious" sysadmins.

I did so, as you mentioned earlier. But still no luck. The other issue is that
while the link is up, my /etc/resolv.conf gets updated at frequent intervals 
(every one hour) with the nameserver being set to 192.168.1.1 alone 
(which happens to be the modem). I realise this when all connections
time out after a while the ppp0 link still showed as being 'up'. I had
to manually copy /etc/ppp/resolv.conf to /etc/resolv.conf everytime this 
happened. I'm investigating on this too, maybe its got to do with the modem
being set to act as a DHCP server.

Yes, there is an editable drop-down list field labelled 'Type' which is being
set to 'Bridge' on all these connection. I could change them to 'PPPoE' in
which case, I get many more options mostly relevant to PPPoE settings (like
username, password, authentication, and so on). Just wondered if these default
connections that I have on my modem are normal or is this something to do 
with some cruft left-over on my modem alone (after vendor testing).

>

Yeah, every other person that I contacted seem to have a different model. 
Moreover, the folks at BSNL too were clueless about my model. They were 
baffled when I asked them about the PPPoE LED, and said there's no such 
thing on the modem. One good thing I noticed among them was their 
awareness on Linux lately. When I told them initially that I do not have 
Windows installed on my machine, they said that the modem should let 
me connect to the internet on Linux too and told me to download relevant 
'Linux software'  from http://www.calcuttatelephones.com/ - atleast a lot 
better than my previous experience with them regarding their support for
dialup connection (when they had no clue about Linux and simply told me 
that I need Windows 95 or better if I have to connect to the internet).

Anyways, I'll tweak around a little more and update on the same.

Thanks a lot for your valuable suggestions/inputs.

/etc/ppp/options - there's an option "usepeerdns"

Get rid of it, and hardcode whatever dns you want to use, in 
/etc/resolv.conf

If you are calling dhcpcd to bring the dhcp IP up, and doing pppoe auth 
straight from the modem rather than using rp-pppoe (another option 
available) then the -R flag to dhcpcd stops it from overwriting an 
existing resolv.conf

No, it is not cruft, I am sure.  You really need the PPPoE drop down
choice in that menu.

Exactly.  When some random bsnl chap came down to my house to give me
my passwd and test the connection, I was not at home; he asked my
sister what OS our comp had.  That he asked a question like that is
itself highly laudable, I would say :)  When my sister mentioned
Linux, he not only recognized the name, but also said "Oh, in that
case, he may need the following info as well" and proceeded to write
down the ip addrs for the primary and secondary dns severs :)

I suspect it is because a lot of early adopters with BSNL are Linux
savvy folks.  I would say it's a good thing overall.

P.S.  At some point we should consolidate all the BSNL broadband
HowTos into a single Wiki page or something.  todo.enque("consolidate
bsnl broadband wiki");

  This would be the desired case when there is a DNS-caching daemon
running on the modem/router, such as DNSmasq. In such a scenario, the default
nameserver on all the systems on the LAN side is set to (say) 192.168.1.1,
the LAN-facing IP of the router, and DNSmasq running on the router
performs name resolution (This is similar to what I have on my routerlinux
box, but this is one hop inward of my UT-300R modem/router. The routerlinux
box talks to the UT-300R using RP-PPPoE on the WAN-facing interface. On the
routerlinux box, /etc/resolv.conf gets updated periodically (?) by RP-PPPoE,
currently showing 61.1.96.69 and 61.1.96.71 as nameservers).

Diagrammatically:

               Routerlinux box                   ADSL modem
                    |                                |
                    V                      (WAN)     V
           -------------------------------      -----------
 (LAN) ----| 192.168.1.1 (eth0)    (eth1)|------| UT-300R |---ADSL line
           -------------------------------      -----------

  Therefore, the fact that /etc/resolv.conf gets updated to 192.168.1.1
on your host means that RP-PPPoE (or equivalent) is picking up something
from (in your case) the UT-300R2, and it may be something that's in
its default configuration.

Whatever "attractive" schemes they come up with, I found their customer 
support/service nothing less than hopeless and would *never* recommend 
them to anyone. I still cant forget the day I got a billing statement 
with a whopping Rs. 18,000 due payment for their supposedly "Rs. 1500 
unlimited internet plan" with their earlier WLL phone scheme. It took me 
close to 5 months to resolve the issue with their billing error. After a 
long painful experience with their service, I gave up on them and 
switched back to a plain old BSNL dialup.

The above are my personal experience and opinion :-)

That fixed wireless phone plan is different .. tata indicom broadband /

The current customer service for dishnet seems quite polite and

I don't think so. If it were possible to mount hals-complete ISO

otherwise...

Keep track of the downloaded files!!! (Not easy with automated jigdo).

My experience has also been very negative - so much so that I joked

Try 'mc' --> Command menu --> Undelete. It support ext2 only and
recovering program file is bit difficult.

Try your luck with e2undel [http://e2undel.sourceforge.net/] if your 
filesystem is ext2 (though it would also work on ext3). But first, 
backup your partition and be prepared to spend enough time :-)

Hai,

You can configure the iptables to accept the FTP and SSH traffic from a 
particular source

 /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s <sourceip>/<netmask> -m multiport --dport 
ftp,ssh -j ACCEPT

For example:

 /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s 172.16.1.39/24 -m multiport --dport 
ftp,ssh -j ACCEPT
or
/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s 172.16.1.39/255.255.255.0 -m 
multiport --dport ftp,ssh -j ACCEPT

usermod -- Modify a user account

Summary :

The usermod command modifies the system account files to reflect the
changes that are specified, like Home dir, password, etc. on the
command line

Example:

# usermod -d /home2/usr1 usr1 -- Create the new home Dir for usr1 in
                          /home2 & Move old Dir contents to this Dir.

# usermod -e 2005-04-30 usr1 -- From 30/4/2005 the usr1 acc will be
                                disabled.

# usermod -f 6 usr1 -- After passwd expires, system will allow the
        user to login for 6 days with a warning to change his passwd.

# usermod -g prof usr1 -- Set usr1's initial group as prof.

# usermod -p $1$d8 usr1 -- Set the new passwd for the usr1 

# usermod -s /bin/bash usr1 -- Set Bash as the default login shell for
                               the usr1.

# usermod -L usr1 -- Lock a user's password.

# usermod -U usr1 -- Unlock a user's password.

If MPlayer failed to recognise your graphics hardware, I doubt it if 
xine/totem would. Rather, you must try reconfiguring your Linux kernel  
with support for video hardware acceleration/DRI and/or enable hardware 
accelaration in your X configuration. 

Can you run the '/sbin/lspci' command as root and let us know what the 
'VGA compatible controller:' entry shows up ?

Thanks all friends, It is so easy, i found it once i adopted the

Totem can use xine as a back-end engine. 
It just provides a nice clean front-end to xine.
(Although I believe it can also use gstreamer for certain things)
However, mplayer is a pretty good player too.
What do you mean by "did not recognize graphics well".
Were you getting the "Your computer is too slow to to play this..."
message?
Or was it something else?

Thanks,
Haran

well, i dont know if this is the best thing or worst thing - it can be 
considered a feature or a liability. if one is hoping to solve ten 
problems on ten machines, sure, openmosix will migrate processes and 
balance the load. but if one wants to solve a ten times larger problem 
using the ten machines, openmosix will be happy to keep nine machines 
idle. one would have to necessarily write a cluster aware program and 
forget openmosix. many applications, especially in aero (cfd and fem) tend 
to need cluster aware code.

ps: i am just winding up a full semester course titled 'applied cluster
computing'. course content includes networking and communication
technologies, cpu architectures, overview of loose (openmosix) and
tight(mpi, pvm) clusters and applications to coarse and fine grained
problems. maybe, i can offer this course after i return to iitm campus.

Yeah man Sriram,
What you say is true. If you need to solve a single problem in
parallel, openMosix is not the solution you should be looking at. A
Beowulf setup would be much better in that situation. openMosix
handles cluster-unaware applications and load balances them, that is
what it does. so if you write programs that use fork() to spawn
processes and do the job, they will work. And you can use threads and
shared memory, openMosix wont migrate those processes!
of late, there are also stability issues in openMosix and the 2.6
kernel extension is long awaited! i'm using a 5 node cluster and have
to live with 2.4.24!

Same here! It seems that the gentleman (Mr. Kannan) has misconfigured

Actually, he has to set his outlook up to move ilugc mail to an exchange
public folder, and then set it up not to send out of office autoreplies

Hi Sriram

BSNL Broadband is now working in Debian(Sarge) but this is what i did.I
configured my NIC to the static IP address 192.168.1.1 and then gave the
primary DNS and Secondary DNS too. After doing this i started rp-pppoe and
executed adsl-setup configured the parameters and did adsl-start but on
doing this though i was able to connect to the internet the conection got
disconnected every 3 mts i dont know the reason why this happened and in an
other terminal i was executing pppd which showed some welcome message and
then displayed the Primary DNS and secondary DNS and then gave some messages

			"Serial Link seems to be disconnected"
			"Couldnt increase MTU to 1500"
			"connection terminated after 2.5 minutes"
Any Download i did at this point of time stopped after some 4 % or max 5 %
.Then to solve this i stopped using that rp-pppoe and then tried this which
ultimately worked :-)
i just executed /etc/init.d/pppd start and then tried connecting it now
works perfectly to log out the connection i just use /etc/init.d/pppd stop
to bring down the connection.

The reason why i tried this approach was the username and password
(admin/admin) didnt work at all so i was unable to use the browser based
administration .


Thanks for your help

Balaji

192.168.1.1 is the IP address that the ADSL modem software assigns to
the ethernet NIC on the modem.

No, to use the steps I have mentioned below, you do not need *any*
additional software like rp-pppoe etc.  Just a web browser.  that's
all.

Yeah, just use 'ifup eth0'.  after editing /etc/network/interfaces
file to configure its IP to 192.168.1.2

Openssh does have an inbuilt pseudo random number generator

Post the output of:

/sbin/ifconfig -a
/sbin/route -n
/sbin/lsmod
cat /etc/resolv.conf

Since the modem has ethernet, you can use the ethernet
card on your system to connect with the modem. 
Which distribution are you using? You might have the
roaring penguin client already. Use,

# adsl-setup

to configure it and connect using:

# adsl-start eth0 <username>

Replace eth0 with your ethernet interface.

If you don't have it already, get rp-pppoe-3.5.tar.gz
from here:
http://www.roaringpenguin.com/penguin/open_source_rp-pppoe.php

Extract it and simply run the go or go-gui script
within the directory: 

# ./go

OR

# ./go-gui

Try 'rpm -Uvh --nodeps *gnome*' and check if that helps.

Which model is it? Your service technician is probably right - laptops
are usually highly optimised - Compaq/HP would have happily put in a
read-only bus just to save a few grams/millimeters.

Not me. What exactly is the problem you got? I have a feeling it is
not possible to do this - lots of stuff expects writable /etc and /dev

Message-ID: <20050413100707.28850.qmail@web31001.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear Friends,

Yesterday i have posted one mail regarding recovering
deleted files.

I used 'debugfs' command, it gaves me command prompt
as

debugfs:

I used 'lsdel' to list the deleted files. But it shows
nothing about the deleted files.

when I used 'dump_unused', it listed all the unused
inodes data as raw data which runs on the screen. it's
all my deleted files.

But I can't able to capture the data into a file.

Is there any possible way to capture the data into any
file/media.

If anybody knows please help me.

Thanks in advance.

Best Regards.

Babu. J

  It depends on the nature of the distro - a lot of minimal router-centric
distros will and must run as read-only root. Examples are routerlinux,
OpenWRT (for the Linksys WRT54G) and the debian-based Personal-Telco distro.

  Usually, the packages in these distros are configured during build to
put their temporaries and other modifiable files in /var/<package_name>/...
or /tmp/... or similar, and /var and /tmp in turn are mounted on a
ramdisk device, or symlinked to a directory on a ramdisk device.

  /etc is mounted on a read-mostly device like flash or diskonchip.

  /dev does not have to be on a writable filesystem - its entries are
special and the kernel knows how to handle it.

  In principle, it can be done. However, it's extremely difficult to
get a notebook CD-RW or Combo drive separately at retail in India.
Your best bet is through EBay (US) and get it shipped to a friend.

There are lots of issues that you have to look out for, including
BIOS support, physical size (thickness as well as depth - both these
vary), shape (older drives were rectangular, newer ones have one
5 sides with one angular side), and bezel shape (these vary greatly
from model to model). Any or all of these can put paid to an upgrade
attempt, so it's not for the faint-of-heart.

Your odds of doing this successfully are higher for no-name 2nd-tier
brands (which tend to be more standardized) and for notebooks with
user-removable caddy-based drives (some Thinkpads, Dells, Toshibas).

dear paul,

       i tried that command, it gave the error "File system not open".
what should i give?
To recover the deleted files, u can use inode number of that files.
Before that u should have enough space to store that images or u
should have separate partition for restore that files.

Subject: [Ilugc] Error with hard disk
Message-ID: <8f1005a10504130649eebd022@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
    I am unable to boot my system, neither Linux nor Win2k. When I
boot It shows loading GRUB and statys there. When boot from Ubuntu
Live CD(Kernel 2.6.7) it says this message.

    My machine has MDK 10.1 with XFS as / file system and ext2 as
/boot file system. It has win2k with fat32.
    What does this mean ?. Is there any chance of recovering data. I
need both Win2k and Linux partitions. Dont consider the option of
approaching a data recovery service provider.

These errors could mean two possible things:
     1. Your hard disk is slowly dying. Its time you backed up all your 
         critical recoverable data onto another hard disk and dump 
         this one. There could've been a disk crash or media wear-out.

     2. The hard disk cable might have gotten loose, and might 
         need some remove-and-resnap procedure.

Though the chances of (2) is quite unlikely in your case considering 
that you have a 10 GB hard disk and it might have reached the end of 
its life-span.

Subject:  we have built a fantasy cricket game, visit www.superteam05.cjb.net 
and register

Hello,
I am a Suchen G. Chodankar(from Durbhat, Ponda) student of final
year I.T. Engineering course at Goa College of Engineering,
Farmagudi.

Me and my class-mate Sagar Arlekar(from Calangute) has designed a
web based fantasy cricket game. This game is similar to
superselector on espnstar.com . The game is built using open source
and free software.
Apache- web server
PHP- scripting language
MySql- database

We are thankful to the open source community.

This game was started as a semester project in Jan 2004, at that
time the project had 7 members all students of I.T. Engineering
course, Goa College of Engineering. In Jan 2005 we restarted the
project work, added new features to it and made it fully functional
and put it online. You can register at www.superteam05.cjb.net. We
already have about 60 users registered.

The game is free to use, open to all and easy to understand. You
just have to select  a cricket team of 11 players that includes 5
batsmen, 4 bowlers, 1 allrounder and 1 wicket keeper. Your team will
gain points as the players selected by you score/perform in real
matches. You compete against other users. The game closes at the end
of the month.

We have a message board on the site to gain your feedback.


Enjoy playing superteam.

Thank You

Suchen G. Chodankar

Well, install the unzip RPM/deb/pkg/whatever. In any case, I think
gzip(1) handles .ZIP files just fine.

Not necessarily. Cluster-aware code can be written for open-mosix
also. The application simply needs to be designed to handle
parallel jobs on different processes which communicate with each
other via IPC. OpenMosix would migrate these processes to other
machines on the pool and hence we'll have N machines working on
different parts of the same problem in parallel. Making a
`problem` capable of being computed on a parallel environement is
a common problem for both OpenMosix/Beowulf.

However, I'm not sure how efficient the IPC is on openMosix. If
OpenMosix is going to bring the entire process core from a machine
on the pool to the original machine., just to send some data
across a pipe., then I think that is really sad. Maybe they should
provide some internally optimised IPC mechanisms which wont
require the process-info to be brought to the original machine
everytime a native IPC call is made. Or maybe they do.

Sorry.. I did not get back to you sooner.  I saw other replies also now.

So what is it that you actually want to run?   What are your 
applications that
you want to have a cluster do?    There are a number of ways to do this 
depending
on your goals/applications.
    - MPI type codes
    - independent nodes - socket/grid/etc/ based
    - mosix as you mentioned
    - Google type where you split the job on to multiple nodes

First define the problem/application.. then design the 
hardware/software.  Even on
a single application you can split it up differently depending on 
resources/time/etc.

I know that some effort is going on in using MIT AU-KBC Tamil spell
checker in OpenOffice.  May be au-kbc guys in the list can shed more
light on this.

Subject: [Ilugc] passing password as argument to su command
Message-ID: <fc21503005041313166d0ff834@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

I use the USB ADSL modem provided by airtel (touchtel). For connecting
to the net.. i have to log in as super user "su -" and then probe the
device and then connect.

I managed to get the probe_device.sh as a scripting file, but i dont
know how to log in as root and then run the commands all from one
scripting file. My parents are used to Windows and its dialers. I
think they will find it very useful (i dont wanna give them root
password) if i can create one scripting file that they can run to
connect to the net. is there a way by which i can log in as root in 1
single command? (not simple "su". "su -" or "su -l" is required)

thank you

You can use the 'sudo' command, it is highly configurable.  You can have 
it do
a specific command or set of commands for a given user or group or all 
commands for
the admin.   It will either prompt you for the user password (not the 
root password)
or you can set the option so there is no password requested.

In /etc/sudoers:
User_Alias    MOHAN=prashmohan

# Command Alias
Cmnd_Alias   PROBE=/givenpath/probe_device.sh

# User priviledges
MOHAN      ALL=NOPASSWD:PROBE


And that would let you run that full path without a password as root.
But use the full path name.

sudo is your friend here. 

* Put the connection commands on a script
* Allow their (your parents') user IDs to run the script without
password. For this you will need to add the following to your
/etc/sudoers using the visudo command as root

appa ALL=NOPASSWD: <path_to_connecting_script>
amma ALL=NOPASSWD: <path_to_connecting_script>

You might want to replace the ALL string with your hostname.

By hostname do u mean localhost? (sorry i know its a real dumb question)
so the line i put into the file should be something like this?
"prashmohan localhost=NOPASSWD:/usr/home/prash/connect.sh"

Yup. Thats what I meant. You could also leave it as ALL. It would also
work just as fine. It specifies the host on which that particular sudo
rule applies.

Now I have a doubt, what exactly is the significance of the
hostname/host_alias is a sudoers line? Is it just to maintain the same
sudoers file across many servers?

man vncserver :)

you need to setup a good ~/.vncrc file, else you will 
get only the defaults , live twm,640x480 res, etc.

Yes. One could centrally manage sudo access for a number of hosts,
with a single global configuration file.

If you do not have modutils installed:

If you tried /sbin/lspci, it should say "No such file or directory".
If you tried just lspci, it should say "Command not found".

Your subject is misleading. It might be that you don't have modutils
installed, or that you don't have /sbin in your path.

Network Administration is a very vast topic. Your best bet is to
progressively take the Cisco recommended certification series (starts
with a CCNA). There ought to be quite a few centers around for that.
On Linux, probably it is best to go for RHCE.

if the frames are slow, you may have to enable dma for your CD drive
with command

hdparm -d1 /dev/hdx  where x is location of your cd drive

Goodness! Isn't that some form of abuse of a free and gracious e-mail 
service ? How long till a bunch of script kiddies start managing their 
own free internet hosting space over this hack ?!

Actually, it's a pretty old hack, it's been there almost ever since 
Gmail started. If I'm not wrong, it's also been published in the book 
"Google Hacks" by O'Reilly. For windows, there's one "GMail Drive" which 
lets you use Gmail as your internet back-up device. Pretty nifty. Google 
must be certainly aware of this. I think it's a good example of Google's 
"do no evil" philosophy.

Vamsee.

I think Google's pretty OK with this, and other nifty Gmail tools.
Yahoo too had one such - a Yahoo drive (a Y: drive on your Windows
machine mapped to Yahoo Briefcase). Pity they pulled it.

Hmmm, I seem to get a hazy picture of what google might be upto in the 
long run - "All your data are belong to us" strategy perhaps. Maybe I'm 
just overly exaggerating :-)

Dear Gilbert Raja,

You have to open the filesystem in debudfs command 

eg 
#debugfs
debugfs# open /dev/hda2
then you can lsdel command to display with NODE Number

Hi,

Oracle 10g and 9i versions are avaiable for Linux. I think they are
distro independent since they are distributed as tar/cpio archives. I
haven't tried Oracle stuff as of now.

Just try the command 'lspci' at the root shell prompt and check if it 
works.

If you are on debian, lspci should be found within /usr/sbin/ directory,
thus the complete path to the command would '/usr/sbin/lspci'.

In any case, typing just 'lspci' as root should ideally work on your 
machine.

You can check it out at:

I have also uploaded the GLV session photos.

2. I believe video was taken during MIT Carte Blanche
2005. If it can be edited, compiled and probably made
as a small video that can be freely distributed, I can
upload it as well. Any thoughts on this?

No commands are working. fdisk -l displays nothing. fsck just dont
work.  badblocks displays lots of numbers. I left it to run for 1 day.
I cant read the disk using less -f /dev/hda. Some command displayed
that it cant read partition table. The bad thing is I dont remember
how the disk is partitioned.
    It is my laziness that caused all the problems. Last week I saw
chkdsk fixing a bad block while booting in win2k. So I understood that
it is time to replace hard disk and I asked in this list for Mandrake
9.2 to install on the new hard disk. But I hadnt had the time to
collect the CD so replacing the hard disk is delayed.

Thanks for all the help.

hdparm and a few other programs have never been on ftp.iitm.ac.in; I
don't know why. I usually just get it from another repository, like
ftp.debian.org.

well well, 
folks, i downloaded the cent os!! but i found that its no way related
to RH AS 2.1 its just a clone of RHEL 4.0. i even went thru
distrowatch.... but couldnt find any clone of RH AS x.x
does a clone of RH AS x.x exist. i found that centos got selinux. and
selinux is not implemented in RH AS x.x. kindly tell me where can i
find a clone of RH AS x.x
cent os 4.0 if u read properly says just a clone of RHEL 4.0 
i even got the srpms which i downloaded from the redhat ftp portal and
when i tried to match the packets they dont match. the major
difference is the xorg instead of xf86 and selinux and etc etc.
cent os is not a clone of rh as x.x 
so kindly sugest me the name of the distro which is a clone of RH AS x.x 
thanks!!
cheers!!
partho
p.s. if i want to make a distro from these srpms what are the do's and
dont's. and what all concepts i shuld have in my mind before i really
try to convert these RH AS 2.1 sprms to a full fledge distro for
personal use. :-)

Yes, the Tamil spell-checker on that CD was developed by the NLP group

In the new NRC-FOSS, we hope to greatly expand our activities in this

I am in this mailing list for a long time now and have set out of office

Good! Now go to 
http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_1.0-7174.html and follow 
the instructions to install the binary nVidia driver and configure your 
X Window System to use the same. Read the README.txt file that comes 
with the downloaded package (the link to it is also found on that web-page)
for detailed instructions and steps to configure support for the binary 
video driver.

As a next step, download the latest sources of MPlayer, and build the 
same with relevant options/features that you need by doing a
 './configure --help | less' from MPlayer source directory figuring out 
what features you might need to enable/disable them to suit your 
requirements and then do a 'make && make install').

My basic build setup commands for mplayer is as below:

    ./configure --enable-gui --disable-rtc --enable-menu --enable-gl
    make
    make install

Now from your X session (with NVidia binary video driver enabled), try 
running mplayer using the following command:
      mplayer -vo gl2 filename.mpg   #[ play a movie file directly ]
OR
       mplayer -vo gl2 vcd://1             #[ play a VCD ]
OR
       mplayer -vo gl2  dvd://1            #[ play a DVD ]

If you run mplayer via GUI (gmplayer), then enable gl2 as your driver in 
Preferences-->Video settings. Also, try enabling the option for 
double buffering and direct rendering.

Tell us if this information helped.

Good luck!

interesting. ok, i have figured out why, blame it on my poorly thought out
excludes. all packages ending in arm.deb, mips.deb, mipsel.deb (and same
with udeb) are excluded. this was my attempt to exclude the arm, mips and
mipsel architectures when debian starting putting these in directories
outside the arm/, mips/ and mipsel/. debian recommends against excluding
architectures, but it seems to me that most of these architectures will
have no takers here. already, debian is the largest archive, contributes
most to inbound traffic and is not that hot on outbound traffic
(popularity of download). we host only i386 and our exclusions (in
addition to above) are *alpha*, *hppa*, *ia64*, *m68k*, *powerpc*, *s390*
and *sparc*.  thusly, more packages may be missing, if they have any of
these embedded in the package name. if anyone has a better suggestion for
doing this, i will be glad to implement.

well, the problem is in your naming. AS is RHEL in one of its flavours, 
the others being ES and WS (and desktop, if you want to include that). the 
ws or workstation version does not provide some of the server packages. 
the es and as versions differ only in hardware support. so, unless you 
have more than 2 cpus, 16 gb ram or an s390, there is no difference 
between es and as flavours (well, support options are also different). the 
differences are between the 2.1 version and 4.0 version, not between es 
and as.

  No, but they were fairly pricey at Rs.12.5k the last
time I looked. Prices could be lower now. For reference,
the AMD Athlon 64 2800+ with Asus K8N motherboard costs
less than Rs.10k now. I know, it's apples vs. oranges,
but the discrepancy is still huge.

  AFAIK, The only socketed C3s in the market are the
original Samuel I CPUs at 667 and 733 MHz, and a few
Ezra CPUs at 800 & 1 GHz.

  I don't think any of the Nehemiah cores, leave
alone the highly desirable C5P core, has reached
the market here yet.

Are you using Debian ? if that is the case, try 'apt-get install 
kernel-image-2.6.11.1-k7' to install the latest 2.6 kernel that you 
wanted.

To solve your video driver problem, you might alternatively want to try 
'apt-get install nvidia-kernel-2.4.27-2-k7' to install 2.4 kernel with 
nvidia binary driver support.

I dont think so.

Not necessarily. The kernel you are using is the latest 2.4 series 
kernel. However, the problems you are facing could be mainly because of 
a lacking binary nvidia driver for your kernel and X.

Sorry to top post.. but the problem isnt gone yet...
This is the problem i was telling you. at present suppose i do a
simple "su" at the command line and exeucte the script.. i get this
error....

setting up USB support (1/5)..

loading preliminary USB device filesystem
mount: fs type usbdevfs not supported by kernel
usbdevfs mounted successfully
/usr/local/bin/startmodem: line 137: lsmod: command not found
/usr/local/bin/startmodem: line 151: lsmod: command not found
/usr/local/bin/startmodem: line 168: lspci: command not found
/usr/local/bin/startmodem: line 211: lspci: command not found


but if i do a "su -" or "su -l" at the command line and execute the
script.. i connect properly.. apparently sudo does something that is
similar to "su" and not "su -". is there some way that i can make sudo
do the difference?

Thank you,

A-w-k-w-a-r-d-l-y s-l-o-w. Has anyone got the CD by
any chance? Do put it in the CDs4grabs page at the
wiki site.

It will be extremely easy for us to share it amongst
ourselves than download it. Really want to try it out
soon :)

perhaps, a bit too narrow? you are excluding stable, unstable, sid, woody,

_arm and -arm instead of *arm (etc)

You didnt google well enough I think.

See this - Summary is that jrockit 5 will definitely work for you, or
see if disabling prelink is enough for your existing weblogic

Alternatively, try this trick (which works for oracle, for example) if
you want to stick to your existing jrockit.

LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1 - or if that doesnt work, LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5

Hi,

I remember Saha posting sometime back saying how GMail's huge diskspace
can be converted into a Virtual Drive, ands someone had posted that this
is *soon* going to get misused..

Well, a guy took that idea a step further and installed Linux onto his
GMail Account.

here's the scoop:

Any brave souls to try it out? let us know how it goes ;)

Hmm...

       Something very interesting is going on in the open-source 
political arena. Seems like Andrew Tridgell of Samba fame has tried to 
reverse-engineer BitKeeper(the SCM tool used to develop the Linux 
kernel) metadata. Linus told about this to his friend and CEO of 
BitKeeper Larry McVoy. Larry got worried and tried to stop Andrew 
Tridgell from doing so, citing IP reasons. What followed is a brewing 
controversy which can have pretty heavy repurcussions for open-source 
software. Tridgell cannot defent himself as he's adviced not to by his 
lawyers. Read all about it:

This was expected wasn't it ?
BitMover was just using the kernel hackers as a test-bed.

Regarding the "The Register" articles, the stuff they throw up seem to
be worse than Slashdot.

They have in one of their articles posted quotes by linus which were
never there.
So whatever register throws at you, take it with a pinch of salt. ;)

Linus is not just a man of words.
he's got the low level stuff going for the next SCM tool going.
It's called git (don't ask me what git stands for :)

I've tried git-pasty, which is a combination of the low level git and  a
few shell scripts working on top of it and it simply rocks!

It's blazingly fast and the most impressive part about it was that git
was released on 07 Apr and as of 14 Apr it has reached version 0.04.
Development seems to be at a blazing speed.

A -mm experimental tree is also available under the new git system.
Unfortunetly, for more information you will need to follow the Linux
Kernel Mailing List.

Okay, I won't ask ;) But where does that put GNU Arch? Isn't it supposed

Any reason for choosing FC2 specifically? FC3 is out for some months

be 08:44:07 of Jan 19, 2038.

Any other alternative  than  a 64 bit  computer? Just check  out this
program.

I think its a old problem

 SOLUTION: This problem can however be fixed easily in standard
computers than in main frames by well-written programs that is
recompiled with new version of the library which uses 8-byte values
for storage. This is possible because the library encapsulates the
whole time activity with its own time types and

functions (but the mainframe programs do not standardize date formats
and calculations). So the Y 2038 Problem can be easily fixed than Y2K.

IBM PC hardware suffers from Year 216 problem. For a PC the beginning
of time starts at January 1, 1980 and increments are made by seconds
in an unsigned 32-bit integer in a manner similar to UNIX time. By
2116 the integer overflows.

Some older Macintosh systems will fail in 2040. The IBM 3070 clock
will fail in 2042. Older 16-bit versions of UNIX will die in 2005.
Windows NT uses a 64-integer to track time.

However, it uses 100 nanoseconds as its increment and the beginning of
time is January 1, 1601. Therefore, NT suffers from Year 2184 problem.

It is not something restricted to 32-bit computers.

You don't need a 64-bit computer just to solve this problem.

This one is all about the size of the size_t data type - which is 4
bytes (32 bits) in glibc and elsewhere - but is now being addressed -
it is being converted to 8 bytes.

No. You have to follow now git mailing list :-). It is
really going at very fast speed. Now, I spend my
weekend for hacking around for git and the scripts.
But I liked bitkeeper personally :-).

Mr Ramanraj K (ILUGC-Member & Lawyer) has developed "CALPP: Computer
Aided Legal Procedures and Proceedings".  It aids in defining  legal
procedures and executing those procedures as proceedings.  
URL: http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/calpp/projdisplay.php

One Day One Command :-
====================

file -- Try to determine the FILE type.

Summary : 

File tests each argument in an attempt to classify it. There are 3
sets of tests, performed in this order: File System Test, Magic 
Number Test, and Language Test.

The File System test is based on examining the return from a stat(2)  
system call.  The program checks to see if the file is empty, or if
it's some sort of special file (block, char, pipe, ...).

The Magic Number test is used to check for files with data in
particular fixed formats. For example, a binary executable files will
have magic number in some fixed position to indicate the OS, that file
is executable. Few standard data files also following the magic number
concept.

The Language Test will happen, if a file does not match any of the
entries in the magic file. File will be checked for the ASCII, UTF8
ISO-8859-x, ... Char set. Once file has determined the character set
used in a text-type file, it will attempt to determine in what (prg)
language the file is written.

Unidentified file will classified as ``data''.

Example:

$ file myfile -- Print the file type.

$ file -b myfile -- Don't the filename in the output.

$ file -f list -- Take the input filenames (one per line) from the 
                  file 'list'.

$ file -k myfile -- Print all matches. 

$ file -z myfile.tgz -- Try to look into compressed file.

$ file -i myfile -- Print the output in MIME format.

$ file -m mymagic myfile -- Use custom magic file.

# file -s /dev/hda? -- Take blk/char special files as an argument.

Read: man file

Well, it turned out that announcement was also _preceded_ by another
announcement that The Evil One will offer their localised office product
(which shall remain unnamed) at a 30% price cut.  While the marketroid
who represented TEO was given ample opportunity to demo their product and
talk glowingly about their proprietary OS, OO got little publicity, and
even the distinction between the two was not made clear.  This must have
left the `common man' quite confused, if not actually enamoured of TEO
and all the great and `innovative' (sic) products that they come up with.
It is a shame that govt. types have once again given in to the 
strong-arm-and-money tactics of powerful monopolies.  Perhaps the only
solution to it would be Peru-style legislation?

A propos, does anyone know if there is any effort to get a `FS-only in 
govt.' legislation in India, somewhat like in Brazil, Mexico, and most 
famously in Peru?  IANAL, but does not the Right to Information
Act provide strong enough grounds to mount, say, a PIL that demands FS
only?

Later,

Anand.

I am facing a whimsical problem in sendmail. Here it goes.

A mail is sent to 4 recipients by Jagan. (Jagan is using MS Outlook 2003.) The mail reached 3 recipients two using outlook express, and one using MS Outlook 2003. For the fourth recipient Amjad it didn't reach even the mail server's mail box. 

The sendmail log says the status as sent for all the four recipients. I have tried sending it from various accounts (from various mail servers in my Org.) to Amjad still that particular mails is not reaching. However other mails to Amjad by Jagan are reaching.

The whimsical mail - has html content and html tables
My mail server details OS - Linux, Email Gateway - MailScanner, MTA - Sendmail

I have faced this problem couple of times and I had deleted Amjad's account in mail server and recreated. Things are fine after that. 
This time I want to find and solve the root cause of the problem.

I removed spam bayes that is created for this guy and sent the mail, by passed the email gateway and sent the mail. According my findings something associated with email account of Amjad is swallowing the mail. I am not able to find what it is.

If I have various perspectives to approach the problem it will help in solving it. Please advice.

(Apologies for lenghty mail)

If it says sent for jagan its no longer a sendmail problem

check the mailscanner, bayes etc logs for what's swallowing the email

and check if the email is getting routed to a bulk folder

or check if his outlook has some kind of rule that's swallowing the email

1. I stopped the MailScanner and sent the mail. Still it didn't reach
2. reg Outlook rules - The mail didn't reach the mail box of this user, i.e., /var/spool/mail/amjad didn't show any trace of this mail.

I was going through this week Junior Vikatan dated 17th April 2005.
There is an article (interview) about this function.  In that
mistakenly, some credit is given to Microsoft for tools developed for
Tamil Open Office!!!!!!!!!!!!    On the same function, I believe
Microsoft Office Tamil (or Tamil support in MS Office - not sure about
the exact
details)  is also launched.  The confusion in the interview may be due to this.

See the attached pdf file for the article.  The mistake is circled and
highlighted.

Subject: [Ilugc] [GLV] Two new initiatives from next semester
Message-ID: <20050418165010.66630.qmail@web50201.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

I want to introduce two new initiatives under
GNU/Linux Vidyashram after this semester's exams get
over.

1. Guide students on final year/self-learning
projects. This involves providing a road-map for
students for doing their projects. Programmers may or
may not help in coding, but, can point them to
resources/links/code examples. Atleast a road-map that
they can take for 6 months, from June-December for
final year projects will be helpful. 

We can also have discussions or suggestions on design,
implementation, programming languages in helping the
students. It doesn't have to be full guidance or
advisor-level help, but, even something for them to
get started will be helpful. We can have these
dicussions in GLV as well.

2. I want to create a database on companies working
with GNU/Linux, in Chennai, Bangalore and other
cities. We can expand the database depending on inputs
and contacts. I shall put this up on my webpage. It
will be useful for students looking at career options
as well as employees seeking new horizons. This will
be a work-in-progress. 

We can also look at newspapers, Indian Express
supplement on Mondays and The Hindu Opportunities on
Wednesdays (or any other), and update them in the
database or put them as a newsflash! Also,
announcements in mailing lists on job opportunities
can also be updated to the database. We can also
discuss job opportunities in our GLV meetings. We have
all the contacts and resources, we just need to
organize them in a proper manner. We needn't put any
contact e-mails as we don't want to infringe on the
privacy of the individual. Just a website link of the
company with location, and info on projects will be
sufficient. Do send me an e-mail if you are working or
involved with GNU/Linux at work.

Regarding presentations for next semester, I want to
give talks to more colleges compared to last semester
(five). For some of you exams are getting over on May
4, for some on May 17 and so on. So, just send me an
e-mail when your exams are done, and we can start
planning for next semester. We can have a meet in the
last week of May, and resume GLV in June.

Well, in the GNU Arch a patch is not a globally unique entity as
how git treats its changesets (I dont know what term they call
them by for git). They do something called a `star-merge` which
makes unique ids unnecessary for the csets. 

But Linus wants a BitKeeper like convenience. He wants to be able
to pull csets from a number of development trees, evaluate them
and merge them on his tree which will be considered as official.

This kinda of functionality is a bit hard in GNU Arch. Where the
maintainer of the tree (Linus) would have to take his changes to
the development-branch first and then `star-merge` it to his., (or
something like that).

Morover, cherrypicking becomes a lot more easier when you use a
cset framework with unique ids. However the programmers should be
consistent. So, basically for these inconveniences, Linus moved
over to the development of git which has a lot of ideas from
`monotone` and some from `bitkeeper`.

I'm still wondering why GNU Arch was designed that way. I'm new to
it. So may be it'll take time to realize why they do things they
way they do. :)

Hi,

GNOME 2.10.1 has made it to Debian Experimental.

The move to unstable will happen after ( *if* ) Sarge releases.
Till then here's a link to Jordi Mallach's [GNOME DE Maintainer] blog
pertaining to the announcement:
http://oskuro.net/blog/freesoftware/gnome-2.10-experimental-2005-04-18-18-37

Ubuntu Warty users can get GNOME 2.10 from Hoary's repositories.

i assume u have worked with FUSE 1.3.Earlier versions of FUSE were intended 
for the 2.4.x series.Probably you can try installing a newer version of FUSE, 
or , 
open kernel/dir.c in your fuse tree and change "vfs_permission(inode,mask)" 
to "generic_permission(inode,mask,NULL)" and recompile FUSE.
A new module will be created ( fuse.ko) which is compatible with 2.6.x

Sujith

This might be of interest for those sitting for placement. How do 
you swap two integers in C without creating a temporary variable ?

/* -- start of code -- */

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
	int a = 100;
	int b = 200;

	printf("a=%d | b=%d\n",a,b);
	a ^= b ^= a ^= b;
	printf("a=%d | b=%d\n",a,b);
	return 0;
}

/* -- end of code -- */

Found it on the usenet C FAQ, question 3.3b. It comes with a warning 
that the code might not be portable across compilers. It worked for
me using VC++.

I hate to be such a pedant, but this causes undefined behaviour due to the
absence of a sequence point between successive assignments.  In other
words, the expression contains multiple ambiguous side effects.  I forget
the exact reference to chapter and verse of the Standard.  The
implementation is basically free to handle this in whatever way it _can_,
even in a way that is completely counterintuitive or unexpected.  So, to
use a memorable phrase made popular on Usenet, this could even cause 
`dragons to fly out of your nose!'  Also useful is the Infrequently Asked
Questions (IAQ) of Peter Seebach: 
<http://www.plethora.net/~seebs/faqs/c-iaq.html>

The other classical method is more portable, but unfortunately, it will
work only if you're dealing with unsigned integers and only if you
can guarantee that an overflow will not occur:

        b = a + b;
        a = b - a;
        b = b - a;

For signed integers, you're basically screwed.

Later,

Andy.

Mr Anand Babu (FSF-India Member) is the maintainer of The Hymn Project. 
It transforms DRM protected restrictive iTunes AAC files to open std 
AAC format to play with standard audio players in GNU/Linux. The purpose 
is to allow the user to exercise his fair-use rights under copyright law.
Apple initially hunted down this project twice. (http://www.hymn.org)

One Day One Command :-
====================

ln -- Make LiNks between files.

Summary : 

Create a link to the specified TARGET with optional LINK_NAME. If
LINK_NAME is omitted, a link with the same basename as the TARGET 
is created in the current directory. By default, it makes HardLinks.

A "hard link" is another name for an existing file. The link and the
original are indistinguishable.  They share the same inode.

A Soft links/Symbolic links/symlinks are a special file type. The link
file actually refers to a different file, by name. At runtime kernel
automatically "dereferences" the link and operates on the target of
the link.

Example:

$ ln --help -- Show help info.

$ ln A B -- Creates hard link B for file A.  

$ ln -b A B -- Same as above. If B is already exist then Take a backup 
               (B~) and creates new B.

$ ln -b -S .bak A B -- Same as above. If B is already exist then Take 
        a backup with specified extention name(B.bak) & creates new B.

$ ln -f A B -- Force. If B is exist then overwrite it.

$ ln -i A B -- Interactive. Prompt the user for removing the already 
               existing file B.

$ ln -s A B -- Creates soft link B for file A.

$ ln -s dir1/myfile -- Creates link ./myfile pointing to dir1/myfile.

$ ln -s dir1/myfile myfile -- Creates link ./myname pointing to 
                               dir1/myfile.

$ ln -s a b .. -- Creates links ../a and ../b pointing to ./a & ./b

Read: man ln

Bye :)

Subject: [Ilugc] connect to an IP through a separate gateway
Message-ID: <8f1005a105041904086ae128dd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
    I need to connect to a machine through a particular gateway since
the machine will accept connection only if it is coming from that
gateways IP. I have two connections of that one is fast and I use that
regularly but remote server wont accept connection from that gateway.
    My IP address is 192.168.4.66 and usually use the gateway
192.168.4.16. But when connecting to site xxx.com I need to use
gateway 202.71.147.xxx. I already have this routing table.

# route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.4.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
0.0.0.0         192.168.4.16    0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0

I added route to xxx.com to use gateway 202.71.147.xxx
#route add -host xxx.com  gw 202.71.147.xxx
SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable

What is wrong with this. I can visit the site through browser but cant
ping as it is blocking.

BTW. In win2k just setting the gateway to 202.71.147.xxx works.
I changed the original IP address and hostnames.

Well, not really. I know for sure,  not because I tried it out now but
because everybody tried it when the debate came up :D

Another thing I can think of is a way to find the largest of two given
numbers without doing  an if-then. Maybe I will  let the people answer
it here :)

Spot on. Even its expanded (and compliant) version:

a ^= b; b ^= a; a ^= b;

will grok if you call it as swap(v,v).

>         b = a + b;

Even this will grok in the same case as above.

The best way of doing it is:

tmp = a;
a = b;
b = tmp;

and the rest are only of academic interest and should not really be in
robust programs.

The screwed part is for portably detecting overflow in signed numbers.
Not that it cannot be done now -- via assembly, say -- because the hardware
(if it is IEEE 7/854) does have support for it.  I don't know why it
has not been done in C.  Maybe compiler writers are too lazy, or maybe they're
too busy thinking of floating point ;-) !

Later,

Andy.

Hi
        I think u have to install the fonts. checkout 
/etc/fonts/fonts.conf and find out the paths in that file. If you have 
fonts installed in those paths then there should not be any problem.

Cheers,
Noorul

Just a nit.  You also meant to pass pointers, presumably,
and to check equivalence inside swap ()?  Then it would grok.

Absolutely.  Totally agree with you here.  You could have said
`the One True Way of doing it is ...' but that would have started a flame
war :-D !

When I typed that, I had in mind a macro-implementation of swap().
Sorry I was not clear.

A function implementation will fail in all cases where the variables
are declared with the "register" storage class (since you cannot have
pointers to them).

"Asking how to swap to variables without using a temporary is like
asking how to drive a nail without using a hammer.  The correct answer
is not "use xor" or "use your forehead", it's "why do you want to do
that?"."

Hi,


The  description of your network  is not clear

why  not ? are you doing a NAT with the gateway IP ? How else will the 
server know you are accessing from the gateway IP?

> #route add -host xxx.com  gw 202.71.147.xxx

Does not  work because  your gateway IP  must be in the same segment as your 
host .
It is logical , think of it this  way

                                                                           |--------E
                                             |----------D--------|
             |-----------B--------|
A-------|
             |-----------C--------|
                                             |
                                             |(Internet)



To go to D you  specify that A should go through B.
If I specify that A  can reach E through D , it will get confused as to how 
to reach D first .
(that is what you are trying to do ) .

Even if you have specified that A should go through B to reach D , you will 
not be able to
assign D as a gw on your host as it is not directly reachable from A.

Dont know about Win2k though .

Hope this helps

bye
Balaji

when the  only tool  you have  is hammer
every problem looks  like nail

Probably you are refering to this (Section number 6.5):
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/open/n2794/n2794.txt

<excerpt>

	6.5  Expressions

       [#1]  An  expression is a sequence of operators and operands
       that specifies computation of a value, or that designates an
       object  or  a  function,  or that generates side effects, or
       that performs a combination thereof.

       [#2] Between the previous and next sequence point an  object
       shall  have  its  stored  value modified at most once by the
       evaluation of an expression.  Furthermore, the  prior  value
       shall  be  accessed  only  to  determine  the  value  to  be
       stored.58)   Informative  annex  D presents an algorithm for
       determining whether an  expression  or  set  of  expressions
       meets these requirements.

</excerpt>

That's well pointed out. There is, infact a whole thread consisting
of 67 posts on the comp.lang.c news group on this:

http://groups.google.co.in/groups?hl=en&lr=&th=f0e83a80e9338bd3&seekm=

I have been using http://www.space2host.com/ which is  located in

dmesg - Print or Control the kernel ring buffer

Summary : 

dmesg is used to examine or control the kernel ring buffer.  The
program helps users to print out their boot-up messages.

Example:

$ dmesg -- Print the kernel boot-up messages.

$ dmesg > boot.mesg -- Redirect the out to file.

# dmesg -c -- Clear the ring buffer after printing.

# dmesg -s4096 -- Set the kernel ring buffer size.

# dmesg -n1 -- Set the level at which logging of messages is done to
               the console.

               1 -- Action must be taken immediately
               2 -- Critical conditions
               3 -- Error conditions
               4 -- Warning conditions
               5 -- Normal but significant condition
               6 -- Informational
               7 -- Debug-level messages
               8 -- All

Thanks for the reply.
 When I did a tracert to the 202.71.147.xxx gateway I found that first
it is passing through a local IP and I set that IP to be gateway and
now it is working fine.

Sounds like a IE hijack by a malware program.
Use Firefox instead.

What if you directly pinged the IP address?
$ ping 204.71.177.70

OR

Open up the following URL in a browser:

http://204.71.177.70

Post the output of:
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf

Did you try opening up URLs on different browsers?

Subject: [Ilugc] Determine which hdd block from sector id

Dear Luggers,

I had  a DriveReady SeekComplete Error signalling  a disk falure

Could somebody help on how to determine the hdd block in which the seek 
failed by the given sector id so that one can run fsck on that partition 
alone to see the problem gets fixed.

Please find the error message below.

This one tells you which partition - 03:08 is major 3, minor 8 - or /dev/hda8.

The "other" way is to figure out where the above LBAsect (63127765)
fits in your HDD.

> Disk /dev/hda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 4865 cylinders
> Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes

Total sectors = 255 * 63 * 4865 = 78156225
Cylinder where the above problem sector is = (63127765/78156225) * 4865 = 3930

Since hda8 below is between cylinders 3926 and 4186, cylinder 3930 is in hda8.

Thanks for the reply and help. It was found that hda8 is the / partition .
Any ideas on how to mount it ro and run fsck would be of much help.

mount -o ro,remount /

Recommended only from within your distro's rescue environment (or at
the very least, runlevel 1).

Dear all,

I installed Fedora Core 3 in my pc where we have a package for screen
rotation, namely,
'Resize and Rotate System Tray App.' 
But the options to rotate the same by 90/180/270 degree were greyed out.

Would be thankful to u, if you could give me some pointers to activate
the same or any other way to achieve screen rotation.

Thank you for your time.

Hi,

KSpyware: http://nzeka-labs.com/hacking/KSpyware.htm

Found this interesting link for a spyware program.

It's written for Windows and gives a good insight on how a spyware
program operates and what information gets spied on, on a Windows PC.

It's written in perl, but simple enough to follow.

Share the link among your Windows-using friends and educate them on how
easy it is to extract personal information from the Windows OS.

Try out http://www.siteground.com/. All their hostings are linux based
and they give 1000MB space, 1000 POP Accounts, PERL, PHP, MySQL, FTP
accounts and much more for $5 a month. I used 
http://www.goodluckdomain.in/index.php to register my .IN domain and
sitground as the host. The whole setup cost me around Rs. 4000 (one
year). It took me 6 hours from the time I put the domain request to
the point where my site was completely up and running. Thats amazing,
considering the fact that two years back it took at least 48 hours,
just for the DNS change to happen.

It still takes close to 48 hours for the DNS change to happen. You might 
have seen the DNS up in india. For your site to be accesssible across the 
world to be termed fully operational it would take close to that time.

Actually no.  When a new domain is registered, DNS "change" is not the
issue - the issue is how fast the domain appears in the root servers.

These days, for several zones like .biz / .info / .org it is instant,
not "upto 48 hours" like before.

On the other hand, when you have an existing DNS record pointing a host
to an IP

foo.example.com.	1D	IN	A	192.168.1.1

Suppose you then decide you want foo's IP changed to 10.0.0.1, then do
the usual stuff required (edit the zone file, change the serial number
and then change the IP to its new value, then do an rndc reload of the
zone).

The 1D there is a TTL (Time To Live) of 1 day for that record in dns
resolver caches (your ISP's dns servers that you get in /etc/resolv.conf
on your linux boxes) the world over.  If the resolver has that host's
old IP looked up already, it will retain it in its cache, and not try to
query example.com's nameservers for it till the 1 day TTL is over.

That's the "dns changes may take upto 48 hours" story ..  it all depends
on the TTL.

hi,

iam using airtel adsl connectivity & a dlink d-502t
adsl router.

adsl router connects to the internet and able to
browse properly from windows. when i use linux iam
facing a weird problem where 

ping google.com works
hence dns resolution is happening.

but firefox, konqueror does not load any page.
sometime iam able to see pages loading in konqueror
but not on firefox.

any pointer on this will be very useful so that i can
remove windows off my desktop.

In my view, Tuxracer should be the "flagship" racing game gor
GNU/Linuxes. I think FC2 ships with it, doesn't it?

Tux kart is also good.

But do note that you need to have DRI working to play these games.

This will not control the bandwidth. This rule just hides the internal IP

webmin is designed in such a way that even a beginner can use it. use
rpm'ed installation and go to the url http://localhost:10000/  and
login and use it

XFS creates a FIFO in /tmp. When there is no space left on the root
device, this can happen as well. Try df -h and see if you have enought
space and if there is none, then you need to free up some and then
restart X.

I was an addr.com customer back in 2001/2002.

The problem is that there is usually a very large number of script
kiddies who buy accounts there and try to snoop on data, run rootkits
etc.  Within two months of my signing up, they had an issue where a
bunch of credit card data used to signup to their accounts got stolen -
I heard this from my friend at 1 AM in the morning (well, daytime in the
USA), confirmed it online then had to call my card service desk ASAP to
cancel the card.

Not been their customer since then.

Write a small daemon using bash script or in some other way. That daemon
searching for files in the directory if present, it will copy the files into
a separate directory. I don't know how much extent it will work for u. Its
my suggestion. For example, the application stores the data in /tmp/*.txt
and delete the same. Whether u want to backup the /tmp/*.txt to some other
folder.  In this case, daemon will solve this problem. I think Bash
Scripting work in both Linux as well as HP Unix.

You first need to see if your ethernet card got detected during system boot:

$ dmesg | grep eth0

if you see any output, it was indeed detected. If you dont, well, then
it might be that you did not fix the card properly after you removed
it, or it might be a hardware issue.

If you do see output, then it is not getting configured properly. Try
setting the IP address manually:

# ifconfig eth0 <ip address>

then type "ifconfig" without arguments and see if the configuration
happened. To set things up permanently, depends on how your distro
handles it... you have not mentioned you distro name..

Mr Visweswara and Team released the alpha version of cross-platform
GUI based Tamil Optical Character Recognizer(OCR) software under GPL.
It will recognize pretrained printed characters. Students are invited
to join in this project. URL http://gtamilocr.sourceforge.net

One Day One Command :-
====================

find -- Search for files in a directory hierarchy

Summary:

Find is useful to search in the deeply nested collection folder. It
can execute some actions on the files, which found by it and it
provides lot of useful options for file searching.

Example:

$ find -- List all files in current and its sub Dir.

$ find / -name resolv.conf -- Find the resolv.conf

$ find /etc -name '*conf*' -- Find all conf file /etc Dir.

$ find ~/ -size 1000c -- Find files that have a size equal to 1KB.

$ find ~/ -size +1500c -- Find files that have a size > 1KB.

$ find ~/ -size -1500c -- Find files that have a size < 1KB.

$ find ~/ -empty -- Find empty files and directories.

$ find ~/ -amin -5 -- Find files accessed in last 5 minutes.

$ find ~/ -atime -1 -- Find files accessed in last 24 hours.

$ find ~/ -mmin -5 -- Find files modified in last 5 minutes.

$ find ~/ -mtime -2 -- Find files modified in last 48 hours.

$ find ~/ -size +1kc -and -mtime 2 -- Find files (Size >1K & modified 
                                      time is 2 Days)

$ find ~/ -nouser -- Find files owned by an invalid user.

$ find ~/ -user user1 --  Find files owned by user1.

$ find ~/ -maxdepth 2 -name 'fi*' -- Search for files starting with 
          'fi' and don't go more 2 level down in the Dir structure.

$ find ~/ -name '*.conf' -ls -- Find the all .conf files and print the 
                                output in ls -l format.

$ find ~/ -name '*.txt' -exec cat {} \; -- Find all text files and cat
                                           the files.

$ find ~/ -name '*.txt' -printf %h\\n -- Find all text file and print
                                            the path of the each file.

NOTE:
1) In the examples, I used Home path for searching the file. You can 
   change it to any other path.
2) Read the man page, to know about other useful and advance options.

Read: man find

Bye :)

Which brings me ask this question..

Is there any community effort within chennai (within India?? ) to provide 
free Wi-Fi support for people.

or atleast provide it at low rates.

I remember Shiv had a similar idea, is it possible to have one such implementation 
driven by a community? Has anyone tried this ( within India ?) ?

Community wireless! I thought India has not delicensed the frequencies 
used by the wirless networks. Of what I know, government own all the radio 
frequencies and these have not been delicensed yet, leave alone the 
community wireless which would be illegal under the banner of running an 
own isp.

  I've seen small Satellite TV dishes (Ku band) available
locally for around ~Rs.1k or less. In conjunction with
the Biquad feed developed by Trevor Marshall,

http://www.trevormarshall.com/biquad.htm

you can get about 30 dBi gain (20 dBi from the dish, 11 dBi
from the feed). With an identical setup at the other end
of a line-of-sight link, you get a further 30 dBi, for
a total path gain of 60 dBi. That's huge - it allows
WiFi line-of-sight links of 50-100 km with sufficiently
tall towers.

  What's the catch? Several.

1) It's point-to-point only. So you can set up a single
large hop, but it's very directional. There'll be very little
signal strength outside the the main lobe.

2) It requires a clear line-of-sight. The curvature of the
earth and the height of the antenna towers limit the length
of the link.

3) The cost of the antenna towers will be a huge multiple of
the cost of the dish, 802.11 AP, etc.

4) Outdoor unlicensed use of 802.11b is not permitted in India.

5) 802.11b is not really designed for long-range backhaul links,
and it has issues with QoS, latency, etc.

  Within these constraints, it's an excellent way to obtain
broadband access in backcountry locations where it would be
prohibitively expensive to lay DSL or Cable. In fact, many
small towns in inaccessible locations in the US have already
deployed similar systems. These are usually hilltop locations
with a clear line-of sight to nearby larger cities. BAWUG and
Seattle Wireless have been experimenting with this for years.

  My other idea involves mesh-networking with an omnidirectional
antenna - I've obtained one Linksys WUSB-11 unit for experiments.

Is that OK with you?

Can I ask a favor? Will you give me a link back on your site? I'd really

Not sure why you put it as OT. It is very much
GNU/Linux.

Motorola A760 runs GNU/Linux and Java-based. Not sure
on the current market price in India.

GNU/Linux to power Motorola phones:
http://news.com.com/2100-1001-984424.html

Motorola A760 and GNU/Linux:
http://kandalaya.org/Docs/A760.html

Check this for GNU/Linux mobile devices:
http://www.linuxdevices.com

The latest Motorola mobile phone is E680 running
GNU/Linux on an XScale processor. Not sure, if it is
available in India.

802.11b has been delicensed for indoor / within a building or campus use
long ago (and my centrino laptop is connected over a linksys wrt54g wifi
router right now)

As for owning radio frequencies, it is quite similar to the usa, where the
fcc is responsible for allotting frequencies. I think the local authority
is TRAI, for this purpose, in india

Any reason for choosing FC2 specifically? FC3 is out for some months
now, and FC4 should be out soon.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0504231214520.12907-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

GCC (GNU C Compiler) 4.0.0 has been released. This release is a major
release, containing new optimization infrastructure that enables GCC
to perform more high-level optimizations. 
URL: http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.0/changes.html

One Day One Command :-
====================

hostid - Print the numeric id for the host.

Summary:

It will print a 32-bit hexadecimal numerical identifier for the host
machine. Certain product registration procedures use this number to
brand a particular user license. The 32-bit quantity happens to be
closely related to the system's IP address, but that isn't always the
case.

If your IP address is 192.168.14.155 then your hostid is A8C09B0E.

A8 -- 168
C0 -- 192
9B -- 155
0E -- 14

Example:

$ hostid -- Print the hostid of the current host.

Read: man hostid

I don't think you will find any distro that can run fast KDE on that.

  Mandrake doesn't crawl, but KDE does. You can give RedHat 6.2, RedHat 7.3
or Mandrake 6.0 a shot.

I would give my vote to RedHat 7.3 any day. All said and done it is
probably the fastest RedHat distro. I think they added too many
useless features for a desktop start up after that which clog the
system. After 7.3 Core 3 ha been an issue that can be called a bit
streamlined but FC3 higher hardware.

Hello,
   please let me know what you infer from the
following observation.

 1)when i tried  to install fedora core 3 in  a intel,
p4, 256 ddr ram system it did not even take me till
the graphical screen. It just showed me the welcome
screen. when i typed "linux text" or "linux rescue" or
simply enter in the startup screen it REBOOTED.

2)the system PROPERLY works with windows XP.

3)Mepis live cd works with little problems. It boot to
graphical screed if failsafe mode is selected.
otherwise it REBOOTS.

4)ubuntu also works properly with failsafe mode.I dont
know if reboots with options other than failsafe mode.

5)knoppix does not bootat all. It reboots for all
options.

6)all those cds that where used in the above process
works well in other systems. so these cds are proper.

Will mandrake or redhat or suse work properly in the
system mentioned. I guess it should be problem of
incompatible graphics card. Any suggestions?

thanks

I need a couple of clarification regarding our IIITM.

1.  What will be the stipend + assistantship, one can
get to the max, when he gets selected to attend MS by
Research or M.Tech too.

2. Where can I get prepatory material for JAM exam for
admission into MSc Maths, bcoz no such preparatory
material is available in the market.

Since I couldnt find these info in IITM.ac.in I posted
these Qs here. Sorry for asking questions which are
irrelevent to this group.

Thx in advance.

Best Regards,
Mahesh...

I dont know .. but this method worked in red hat 9 (pssst... i think u
will need windows installed for this method) . open the first iso..
and extract a folder called winutils to base drive. Place all the isos
in 1 drive.. now boot from a startup disk and go to the winutils
folder and run autoboot.bat

the rest is the same... the installation will b in text mode though

Hi!
  
   Try xfce4.2 . I bet you won't be disappointed. I had a 633MHz
system with 128 MB RAM. I was happy with xfce. I later added another
128 MB RAM though.

Bye!

Sure enough. You can do it. The link was right here in ILUGC some time
back & I installed Fedora Core 3 using that method. I will describe
the procedure in brief below

Psstt, My Friend but you are totally wrong. You need GRUB or a Linux
boot loader installed on your system for this and you can have it
done.

I upgraded from RedHat 9 to FC3 this way and even corrected screwed up
FC3 to right FC3 this way. All you need is GRUB  on your MBR. So you
can actually install a basic old distro first that you have a CD of
and just get GRUB on to the MBR if you already dont. Or in your case
as you suggested you can download GRUB for DOS and then install using
Windows itself.

Once you have GRUB

Modify menu.lst (or even grub.conf I guess) to add new section "title
Anything you want"
as follows:
title Anything you want
kernel (hdx,y)/"path to images"/vmlinuz
initrd (hdx,y)/"path to images"/initrd.img

Here x in hdx should be replaced with hard disk number and mostly it
is 0 if you have only one but you can figure that out by having a look
at the other entries in this file.

"path to images" should be replaced with the complete path to the
folder you have the images in.

y should be the partition's minor number -1. so if imaages are on hdx5
it becomes(hd(whatever here),4) and so on.

Then by mounting the first disc's ISO image as a virtual device(which
I cant remember cos I did it using some fidgety command from LFY)

Copy vmlinuz and initrd.img to the folder contains ISOs

ReBoot and enjoy.

Psst: If you are using M$
1.) Download GRUB FOR DOS from http://newdos.yginfo.net/grubdos.htm
Tip: Download the version 0.2 preview or above
2.) Unzip it and copy the file "grldr" and directory "boot" to c:--
Modify the file c:\BOOT.INI to add the following in the last line:
c:\grldr="Start GRUB"

Modify GRUB configuration as mentioned above.

3.) Use Deamon Tools (from
http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/portal/portal.php ) to mount first
disc in Windows and copy the files mentioned above.

Hi

Instead of burning 4 CDs, why not burn 1.

Copy all ISOs to a single dir.

Extract the boot.iso cdimage from Disk1 iso of FC4.
(you can use winiso for windows or mount as loop in linux)

Burn that to a cd.
You can also use a Re-writable disk.(that's my usual method)

Copy ur FC4 ISOs to a windows partition.
Because you cannot mount the partition containing
the ISOs during installation.(can do it later)

When you are booting from the CD you just burnt,
the install process will ask you for the location of
your ISOs. Select the hard drive option,
and give the partition and dir. After that its the same as a
CD install...


Have fun..

Regards
Easwaran.K.V

Hi

The following command mounts the iso image in the
current dir to a dir called "temp" which is also in the current dir.

mount -t iso9660 -o loop  sarge-i386-1.iso ./temp

Now temp dir will have the files of the iso extracted...

You must be root to use mount.

for more info - man mount

Hey folks,

       Did anyone successfully install MoinMoin on Apache recently? It's 
giving me one hell of a time - Moin-user list is not much help either. 
Basically, I'm following the installation as it says in the 
documentation, but when I try to access my new install, it says this:

MoinMoin Configuration Error

Could not find a match for url: "192.168.1.44/mwiki?action=test".

Check your URL regular expressions in the "wikis" list in "farmconfig.py".

   * linux2 (posix)
   * Python 2.3.5 (/usr/bin/python)
   * MoinMoin release 1.3.4 (revision 1.3.4 release)

The FAQ says I should delete farmconfig.py, which is what I did, but I 
still get this error. Any ideas?

TIA,
Vamsee.

Dax guys are integrators... Dax modems will contain chipsets from
other chip manufacturers. See if you can read the main chip
name/number by peeling off the Dax sticker (I'm not responsible for
your warranty;-))

Then go to www.linmodems.org and see if your chipset is supported.
carry on from there.

hi luggies,
i want to know what the basic use of a loopback interface??
why is it used?

i also want to know about the route command,
 is it used to send specific incoming packets, to some specific 
destinations precisely?
if thats the case,  are gateways build using route command?

and also what is the role of ARP cache?
why do we need to maintain it?

regards peevee

This is probably because the remote pppd and your pppd couldn't reach
a consensus on how to interact - more specifically, this could be
because the remote end insists on an auth protocol which you haven't
configured. Put the keyword "debug" in your pppd options file (I think
/etc/pppd/options) and try again - you will get to know what is
happening.

There is the obvious use of testing and using networking software on
standalone machines. A lot of popular software do not look at
additional access control when the connection is on the loopback
interface. Apart from this, it has certain uses in routers (in load
balancing configurations).

route command does not send packets. It just alters the kernel routing
table - which is consulted on a "longest match" principle, when
packets are transmitted. I do not understand what you mean when you
ask whether gateways are built using route command.

In any case, route/ifconfig etc. are deprecated and obsoleted by the
ip(8) command.

You need to maintain a cache of ARP lookup results so that every
single packet to be transmitted does not require an ARP lookup (which
would slow down your network considerably). Almost any caching service
- be it your ARP cache, a web cache like squid or a DNS cache - is
meant to speed up somebody's online experience.

 sorry for that wrong question on route and gateway ,,
 i mean to ask, is route table used to specify a predefined  incoming
 packets, to be sent to a destination address??
 if its case, how is gateway differnt from a  route table??

Let me put it this way. A route table tells you what
network addresses are connected to which interfaces.

> table??

Depends on the context. A gateway can mean a default
route interface for systems in a LAN. A gateway can
also mean a router.

Routing table in default configuration is consulted only on the basis
of the destination address. The source of the packet does not matter.
With ip(8) you could configure policy routing by which you can make
routing decisions on a number of other parameters - source IP, ports
being used etc.

I still don't understand what you mean by asking the difference
between a gateway and a routing table. A gateway (the term nowadays is
a router) is usually a machine with a routing table - either
statically configured or dynamically learned, and can forward packets
between interfaces.

How does a routing table tell you that?

For example,

$ /sbin/route -n

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags
Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.43.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U    
0      0        0 eth0
169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U    
0      0        0 eth0
127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U    
0      0        0 lo
0.0.0.0         192.168.43.1    0.0.0.0         UG   
0      0        0 eth0


192.168.43.0/24 network is through eth0 interface.
169.254.0.0/16 network is through eth0 interface.

A route table will also contain network addresses that
may not even be directly connected to the system's
interfaces. 

For a large network with routers, this information is
exchanged in BPDUs (Bridge Protocol Data Units) when
you do STP (Spanning Tree Protocol).

But it is said that routers work in Network layer, and gateway works in 
Transport layer?
isnt that true? (not considering the latest, routers )...
then whats the difference?

I think you meant to describe BGP, OSPF and the like. STP is a
protocol used by switches to detect loops.

Message-ID: <2382.61.247.255.57.1114420719.squirrel@www.songbirdtech.com>

Has anyone here had any success with installing Linux on a machine with
Asus K8S-MX motherboard and a SATA hard disk?

My configuration is:

Asus K8S-MX motherboard (SIS 965L Southbridge)
AMD 64 2800
256 MB DDR 400
Seagate Barracuda 80 GB SATA HDD

I have tried to install multiple versions of Linux - Mandrake 10.1, Gentoo
2005.3 without any success as the HDD is not found during installation. I
understand that Mepis does not recognize the SATA HDD either.

I have installed Windows XP Pro SP2 on this machine without any problems.

I have been through the documentation available on the net - as of kernel
2.6.11, SIS 965L is not yet supported. However, I am not sure that is the
same case for Kernel 2.6.11-7 (the newest).

By the way, Solaris 10 too failed to install.

I am wondering if FreeBSD is a good option since I have located SIS 965
mentioned in the driver files for FreeBSD.

Would appreciate any tips.

Thanks and regards,

Have you tried Knoppix? Just pop in Knoppix Live CD (the latest one)
and see if you hard disk is getting detected.

If yes, then do a hd install and then try to get you favourite distro installed from Knoppix.

Recently I attended Novell Linux Open Enterprise Server launch Progamme,
they introduced some applications
like e-directory (LDAP - single sign-on), ifolder (for cross platform

I just enquired about cost, they told Novell OPS based on no of clients

hi friends,
can anyone tell me how a browser typically works....
I mean, when i type a web address, how or where does it resolve the ip 
for that name,
how does it know which server to contact for resolving it first??
later i know that the dns is resolved and the packets reaches the 
respective server, and response comes accodingly,
all i want to know is , the initial part..

When u type a website's address in the browser it queries the DNS
server, configured in that system for the ip address of that website.

Not just a browser, but any network-aware software does the initial
part similarly.

Every TCP/IP "stack" has a subsystem called a resolver - your browser
typically starts by asking the resolver to resolve a name into an IP
address. The resolver consults a configuration file - /etc/resolv.conf
on Unix - and asks the nameservers listed there (which is typically
the IP address(es) of the nearest DNS cache) to resolve the name for
it. The DNS cache performs a complex recursive lookup procedure, and
extracts the IP address associated with the name, caches the result
and tells your resolver what it got. The resolver in turn tells your
application the IP address. Then the browser switches its attention to
the socket subsystem of TCP/IP and tries to open a connection to the
IP address it got thus.

It is in reality somewhat more complicated (especially on Linux,
Solaris etc.), because another layer of abstraction exists between the
resolver and the application called Name Services. Depending on the
configuration in /etc/nsswitch.conf, this layer decides whether to
contact the resolver, the NIS database or simply your /etc/hosts to
figure out what IP address is associated with a given name.

Either you manually configure it (in /etc/resolv.conf) or a DHCP
server assigns it.

I mean to ask, how does that /etc/resolv.conf file know initially  what 
is the nearest , or at least ,what is the ip address of a DNS server? i 
am talking of initial settings, i install my pc , and then now i am 
talking...
does each browser have a fixed dns server? or how?
hope you got my question,

You have to manually add the DNS address or If your IP address is
assgined by the DHCP server, then DHCP server will set the DNS ip or
if you browse thru Proxy, then proxy will takecare the DNS Part.

As I mentioned, you as the system administrator provide the DNS cache
IP addresses during installation. In Redhat (and presumably in other
distros too), this is done during network interface configuration.

Yes. Routers also implement switch functionality,

Most ISPs use BGP for external route learning.

Need more information. Which modem? System

Post the output of:

  PDF Docket Generator for MHC using PHP 5.0.4, PDFlib Lite 6 and DOM 2
(To print dockets for some filings in the Madras High Court)
released at:
http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/calpp/cvs/co.php/calpp/src/test/mhc_dockets.php?r=1.1&Horde=1b0f0f3e632b8e6737ea1c8ef00804d7 


This is  a stand alone script, that could be used to generate dockets as 
PDF files.

Printing dockets are really not that exciting, but this is an example of 
enabling users to add input  elements  dynamically to post data more 
efficiently.

The OP had asked for a distro fast on low RAM and KDE as the desktop
environment.

XFCE is only a desktop environment and not a distribution.

XFCE is fast even on my FC3 running on 128 MB. While KDE takes a
minimum of a minute to get up and running XFCE is up and loaded in 10
seconds flat. ( I am talking here about the time from the graphical
login screen once the machine has booted up and X is running. ).XFCE
is not a fully functional environment though and has its own
restrictions for a new user. But I dont think anything can quite match
it in the sheer apeed.

Gotcha, Maybe this should help. Got it from the privacy and security

I believe Kivio has some plugins which allow you to do
that.

Hello linux fonds,

I need to learn networking in linux in depth.
In my home, i have only a single linux box.
Is there any Network Simulators for linux.
I searched for it in net.
it gives a lot but very high sized as 400 Mb.
I can not download them with my dialup connection at browsing centers.

I hope the Linux For You magazine would have give it in anyy of its CDs.
So, can any one search for it in ur LFY cd collection
and give it for me?

Thanks,

Yes Enigmail provied a seemless integration between Thunderbird and
GPG I've just implemented this in my office recently without much
issues. If you are using windows you need GPG CLI for windows.

Following link is "Mozilla With Enigmail and GnuPG Mini Howto" very

Thanks for the information. Are you using the exact same motherboard -
Asus K8S-MX?

The problem is with the southbridge chipset on the motherboard - SIS 965L,
which is not currently supported in the Linux kernel as of 2.6.11 as far
as I know. I have tried using FreeBSD 5.4 as well - but no luck, it does
appear that the FreeBSD 6 CURRENT might have the update for handling the
SIS 965L, but there are no ISO images available and I don't have the time
or the energy to download and recompile the entire FreeBSD distribution
from source.

And thanks a lot for the Cent OS offer. If it works, I can try and
download the Cent OS off the net.

Prem

Message-ID: <1114526690.3797.4.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi,

I've got a Sony Vaio laptop and am having some difficulty getting
suspend to work.

What do I theoretically need to do to get software suspend working on
Fedora Core 3?

grepping for "swsusp" gives me (among others)
/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-2.6.9/linux-2.6.9/kernel/power/swsusp.c

Does this mean that the stock kernel that comes with FC3 has software
suspend built in?
What do I need to do to get it to work?

Thanks,
Haran

If you are using a dial-up connection to the internet, you should
get this as a part of the PPP exchange.

Name resolution is for the entire machine, not for one application

This is applicable for SuSe 9.3 , but can you poke around in your
FC/FBSD/Debian Installation if a similar option can be passed to the
installation process.

'Gateway' is a loosely defined term. In the context of routing tables,
gateway refers to the host or interface through which all packets not
explicitly defined in the routing table is to be sent to (meant in the
sense it is a gateway to the network as a whole)

As for the 'gateway working on the transport layer', it means that it
is a gateway between two different protocols. Am not sure that a
gateway is restricted to working only in the transport layer. For
example you should have a gateway to connect an IP network to an IPX
network (operating at the network layer). Similarly, a gateway is
required to connect an ethernet to a token ring network (operating at
the data link layer).

Hope this helps!

Subject: [Ilugc] Debian Sarge Mirror
Message-ID: <4dc6c90405042621217e7490f2@mail.gmail.com>

HI

I wish to mirror debian sarge at our office for our intranet users. If
i have to download (8gb, approx), it might take couple of days to
complete.

So, I wish to check whether anybody else have mirrored sarge. If yes,
will you permit me to bring the hard disk and copy the data to my hard
disk ? I know that we do have a mirror at ftp.iitm.ac.in. But,
Mr.Sriram is out of country and i dont know who else i should contact,
in order to copy the data to my hard disk. Any help in this regard is
highly appreciated.

TIA.

Dear Toufeeq,

Thanks a lot for the information. The thread that you linked to actually
talks about the ECS G 732 Notebook based on the SIS962 chipset and using a
standard PATA HDD. Both of which are supported on Linux.

My computer uses the SIS965L chipset which is not supported. So no luck
there either. I am writing the driver for the SIS965L now since there does
not appear to be any other way.

Thanks anyway.

A few months back PCQuest shipped a DVD with Sarge (i386).  If nothing
else works out it would be best to go with it.

Be patient :-)  I think what happens is the dependencies are updated,
then apt-get will keep looking for the latest versions of packages
which might not be there because your rsync has not completed.

Also, I assume you have done a 'apt-get update' ...

Thankx for your info once again.
I understand your point. The mirroring was in progress for the past
couple of days. I am facing the same problem forever.

For example, when i configure nfs and do 'apt-get install wu-ftpd' it
is failing. It reports that the package is missing. I am very sure
that the nfs dir is mounted properly and the package exists. Infact,
the same command was running fine before i initiated the mirroring
process. So, do you mean that we cannot use apt-get when the mirroring
is in progress ?

> Also, I assume you have done a 'apt-get update' ...

No, i have not done 'apt-get update'. Infact, i am unable to -:)

No, that is not what I mean.  The package might be there, but it might
not be the right version. Check the version of package you have and
the version of the package apt-get is looking for.

Hm.  Interesting ... I faced some issues myself :-)  I actually gave
up mirroring debian over my bsnl broadband and just directly access
the iitm mirror...

I think the moral of the story seems to be that one should not try
debian mirroring with anythign less than a T1 pipe to the net :-)  
the packages you download become outdated even before you finish
downloading them :-)

It appears that Windows XP 64 does not retain full backward binary

Message-ID: <96dc1b3905042704256c696fcf@mail.gmail.com>

I am behind a proxy server and was using all this while.
The "pager port" settings that i was using were 5050,119,80 etc...
At any given piint of time,atleast one of these would work.
These are some of the suggested ports in the FAQ at gaim.sourceforge
I have no clue as whether these are arbitrary.
But now, all the suggested ports are being blocked by my proxy.
I get "proxy server does not allow xxx tunneling" as the error message
All of the above is for a yahoo! account.
For my msn accoount..there is a "http method" ..which also fails..says
"reading error"
I have written to the sys ads who take care of the network asking them
allow tunneling.but i have not received any response from them.
Is there any way that I can overcome this problem??
Also, i need to mention here that yahoo messenger in windows and amsn
in linux work fine..i just named the proxy servers..i did not have to
choose tunneling ports etc.
 
Thanx
Aswin

ps: i also faced another unusual problem..the account properties
window of the yahoo! account goes far beyond the screen size and i am
not able to see a few  text boxes at the bottom!..these are for
setting ur own proxy settings..as a result of this i am using
"environmental settings"

1) Comment is removed in auto.master ?
2) autofs restarted ?
3) Are you able manually mount it ?
4) Once switch to that dir, Autofs will mount it.

Subject: [Ilugc] vsound problem
Message-ID: <5ef17c2d050427234430802e2c@mail.gmail.com>

folks!!
i have a strange error in my centos boxes. all the 4 pcs p2, p3 , p4 ,
amd 64 gives the same error with vsound. i read in digit u can capture
the streaming audio with some windows tool. so i searched and found
vsound is the ideal tool for same work in tux. i downloaded it and
installed it.
no matter what syntax i use the media stops to record after some time. 
i tried these options 
$ vsound -f station.wav realplay radiostn.pls 
$ vsound -f station.wav -r 44100 realplay radiostn.pls 
no matter what syntax i use the vsound just crashes... i mean it stops
recorning from that radio station. esound keeps on running, sox keeps
on runing. frankly speaking there is no error at all. then why is the
vsound not able to run the recording??
i asked the same qstn in centos forum and centos in freenode!! none of
them agreed!!
beside vsound is a banned utility by RIAA!! so there is no official
support for vsound. but its an excellent tool for grabbing the audio
from any streaming media... help!!
yes, tho the tool is illegal, but the media which u extract uysing it
is legal and u can distribute it. u dont break any copy right law.
cheers!!

1) Manually mount the NFS partition in the client PC, for checking.
2)Remove the comment in following line.
  # /misc /etc/auto.misc  --timeout=60
3) I hope, your auto.misc is correct
4) ln -s /misc/mydir /mydir
5) restart autofs

Also read the autofs docs.

OK OK I end up what I've started.
We all know MKS for quiet some time this mail titled some sitewatch
and from a name which looked anonymous (at least to me) so I thought
this is spam and wanted to know about it. I'm really sorry if I
bothered any one in here.

sendmail and postfix are both MTAs I hope you might want to use any one of them.
blocking and allowing certain websites is possible with squid. I've
not used webmin to configure though.

Hi,
I need to talk /present about any of the
latest technology in computers or related
fields.

Time duration may be around 10 to 15 mins.
Audience will be software developers and
consultants. The presentation is on
next week(so roughly 1 week time I have
for preparation)

The first topic came to my mind was
Extreme programming. I discarded because
it is too general and the concepts are known
to many people and wont be much interesting.

The second topic "Open source" is also known
to almost all of them.

The Thirds Topic I got in my mind was Xen.
I dont have practical experience working
on xen. But good material is there on net.
So, I think that can help me.

My first rescuer google is not giving me
specific answers this time.

As a second rescue or help only ILUGC came to
my mind.

If anyone could provide one or more interesting
and catchy topic/s it would be very helpful.

Thanks and Regards,
carti

Innovative Chennai-based firm is looking out for the following:

Further details from >>>> "Yuvaraj Galada" <yuvaraj@novatium.com>

Hi Fred:

Below are two kinds of profiles whom we intend to attract.

On both, we are looking at active members in Linux community, who have
good knowledge the different open source products.  Preferably
contributed to the Open Source movement....

-----
The server side hosts most of the users applications and data. To work
in this area we are looking at one person with 4 to 6 years of
experience in software industry. Of course like the client side, we are
also require people with lesser experience. These person should have
very good knowledge of the different component, utilities and
applications in Linux. We are looking out for people who can enrich the
existing server side software. the areas that we will be working in
include.

       * X Window internals.

       * Network and remote Management of server and clients.

       * User information and data management.

These persons should have strong C and debugging skills. As in the
client side, we expect the person with experience to mentor and lead the
rest of the team.

On the server side, we require one person with good J2EE knowledge. We
expect this person to work with Linux App Servers.

-------

-----
We are looking for persons with experience in developing and porting
applications onto Linux. Since the foot print of Linux on the client
side is low, persons with experience in embedded Linux is preferred.
We are also looking at persons with experience in device driver
development. This is a urgent requirement for us, since we would like to
start supporting a few devices on our Thin Clients.

Some of the characteristics we are looking for in these persons are as
follows.

       * Experience in Linux OS Build and Tool Chain.

       * Experience in TCP/IP Stack Porting.

       * Expertize in 'C' Programming on Linux.

       * Embedded Software Testing and Debugging Skills.

Though we are looking for people with 2 to 4 years of experience, we
would like to have at least one person with nearly 6 years of experience
in software industry. We expect this person to mentor and lead the other
members in the embedded Linux team.
