And then there are libev[1] and libevent[2] libraries which offers a nice abstraction over 
poll, kqueue, epoll, select etc. for events based programming.

GLIb[3] has a very easy interface to write an event loop too. Feels OOP but in C if thats your cup of tea ;).

Needless to say, programs written using these libraries are portable across multiple platforms.

         Should it be specifically in PHP? If not, you can try
Python's report lab. Another option is to use phpmyadmin. IIRC, it has
options to generate some reports. For multiple users, you can provide
logins with restricted privileges. But it needs to be tried out
because I am not sure of the exact set of features that it supports.

average cost of such device? It will be good if I could get something for

Dunno what you mean by layout.

You have several different PDF generation Perl modules on CPAN.

They take input in various forms, text is obviously the default choice.

So you can use an SQL query tool that can get you text output
 of your columns and you can generate a table from it as a PDF file.

I use PDF::Table, PDF::API2.

Message-ID: <CABmCGuBAbfNT1-tBYecOtYAGTsm=6JcDuaY9uw5k5e8iNsdUJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Am not very sure if it is an OT. But potential
solutions/troubleshooting guide could be of help.

I have a BSNL BB connection connected to a PC and a Laptop through an
ADSL router NATed to a NETGEAR WiFi router. The PC runs on Kubuntu
10.04 64 bit and the laptop runs on Kubuntu 9.04 32 bit. The browsers
that I tried are FireFox 11, Opera 11.62 for Linux, Google Chrome,
Konquerer, links, lynx, etc...

Some of the sites such as icicilombard, slashdot, some of my corporate
sites, hotmail, yahoo mail, the hindu, etc.. aren't accessible. Some
of these sites stop loading midway, while someothers do not respond
(timeout). I ran a traceroute to these sites and the response is
similar to the results from www.tracert.com. When I try to connect to
the internet through my Airtel 2G (laptop connected to cellphone),
these sites open up. I tried to open these sites from my brother's
place, which has BSNL BB (different telephone exchange)  connected to
Kubuntu 32 Bit 11.10. These sites open without issues. I also verified
if there are issues with the DNS servers, and confirmed that it isn't.

This makes me think that there is some problem with the routing of the
BSNL routers in my exchange, or an issue with my router.. Is there a
way to confirm this? If that is the problem, is there a way to
circumvent the same?


with regards,
Natarajan

           I don't think they use different routers for each exchange.
Can you try to get your brother's router and use it from your
place(after the necessary config changes) ? That will help is identify
if the issue is with your router or with BSNL's. Thanks

The device you're looking for is called a Graphics Tablet. There may be
cheaper devices  / second hand devices available within your budget but I'd
say the ones from 'wacom' are the sought after value-for-money deal (will
cost you about Rs.2000/- at a min, IIRC). I have a "Wacom Bamboo" model
tablet - and I use it extensively with gimp for hobby graphics work.

"gromit" is a useful screen-pointing / drawing utility that may also be
very handy for rough-work / demo-like uses.

It is most likely a local issue. Can you provide the following details ? 
It will help debug the issue.

1. ping ilugc.in
2. ADSL Line Attenuation (Downstream & Upstream)
3. ADSL Noise Margin (Downstream & Upstream)
4. ADSL Connection Speed (Downstream & Upstream)
5. Do you have the modem connected after the splitter ?

You can get the ADSL details from the BSNL router. If you don't have the 
username:password try the default admin:admin.

I am not PHP guy to help you. Not sure this what you want.   I am just
sharing what I seen from my friend portal. He is using wkhtmltopdf via PHP
bindings in reporting portal  to prepare pdf reports from html:

If you want to use specifically php, You may look wkhtmltopdf

wkhtmltopdf : http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/
PHP bindings : https://github.com/mreiferson/php-wkhtmltox

There is also some pure php modules available to convert html to pdf.

Thanks

Currently Ubuntu has the best support for Wacom pen-tablets . Others such
as iBall may work , but there would be issues . For example I was helping a
person with a iBall pentablet , It worked out of the box , but had some
issues with movement , So had to do some tweaking to get things working
smoothly .
So think before you buy.

Embedded System is for a specific set of task and designer can roughly

Subject: [Ilugc] Sqlite database tutorial part I
Message-ID: <CALDskyxam-f_T-y+Fu6w90vDub8AT_Nkumyy4av0_5pj0+Ok8Q@mail.gmail.com>

This tutorial is a small introduction to databases, SQL language and
the simplest
way to get started on using an embedded small database for uses which
are common.

To begin with my understanding of SQL and databases has been very sketchy
 and incongruous for a long time.

In recent years however things changed. Today I can claim that I put SQL to
 good use.

To put things in perspective, other than crazy fellows like my ilk
most of the world
lives and moves on databases.

All your ticketing, bank transactions blah blah are done using DB.

So learning SQL is something that a lot of average programmers and
grubby folks do
grudgingly.

But properly applied, sqlite and SQL are both very pleasant.

Okay let us start from the start.

I will split this content into two mails. In this mail I will start with sqlite.

What is sqlite?

It is a very small database that supports the SQL standard or is
compliant to a large degree.

There are really small key value pair(table) databases like tdb in
samba, Berkeley DB, gdm etc.

But no SQL.

SQL = Structured Query Language

It is a method to extract data which is basically columns from a set of rows.

Okay, let us look at a trivial example.

Say you have a very simple data set(table).

A table is nothing but a name value pair.

Each row in a database is a separate data point or name value pair .

Usually it is one name and one value or multiple values.

Does not matter much. But each row is always the smallest unit of
independent data.

Let us look at it this way.

I want to store and manipulate the marks of students in a class.

There are 5 subjects, phy, che, math, Tamil and English.

Okay here you go:

Rahim 20 30 40 50 100

Syam 20 40 40 50 100

Priya 30 50 100 60 80

Okay you have 3 students with their credentials.

Now Each of them is represented in an SQL DB like this.

$ sqlite3 marks.db
  > create table marks (id integer primary key, name string, phy
integer, che integer, mat integer,
 eng integer, tamil integer);
> insert into marks values(NULL, "Rahim", 20, 30, 40, 50, 100);
> insert into marks values(NULL, "Syam", 20, 40, 40, 50, 100);
> insert into marks values(NULL, "Priya", 30, 50, 100, 60, 80);
> quit;

There you go.

You now managed to store them in a nice SQL formatted sqlite DB(table).

Check:

$ echo "select * from marks;" | sqlite3 marks.db

You will see values.

Right. You get it so far?

Now I have only talked about rows.

Each dataset is stored in a row, but the table schema or type is specified by
 how many columns each datapoint will contain.

In this case, the columns are name and marks in each subject.

Now you can look for them.

$ echo "select phy from marks;" | sqlite3 marks.db

Or

$ echo "select phy,name from marks;" | sqlite3 marks.db

Good.

You are happy now. Aren't you?

Usually people are discombobulated by various terms that they absolutely
 don't need to know when dealing about DB and SQL.

User ID, password, TCP, port and so on.

Mysql, postgres ...eeek.

Instead sqlite is a file db, no username, password nonsense.

Just plain sql. Just copy the stupid file and you get the DB.

Backing up is simple. It supports a huge dataset.

All the common software you can imagine that apparently have nothing to do  with
 databases use SQLite.

It is called an embeddable DB and it sure it.

But I don't care. It gets my job done, gives me the convenience and superb
 power of SQL.

We will see that tomorrow. Okay?

Hi ILUGC members,

Thanks for your valuable suggestion. I have modified the code in such a way that if I search for an open office file that has 'spaces' in the name, it will output the kind of file. 

Essence of the code : 

I will create a file in the name that was converted from space format to underscore format. 
I will open the document file and save it in the format as per the extension. 
This is only for open document file. 

Code Snippet

#!/bin/bash
echo -e "Input the file that you want to search: c"
read input 
find ~ -name ${input}
echo -e "Input the file that you want: c"
read input1
export input1=`echo $input1 | tr ' ' _ `
touch ${input1}
ooffice ${input1}
file ${input1}

I would like to know how to write 'if' condition for image, audio, video files etc. 

Thanks and Regards,
Bharathkumar A.V.

Okay.

You can escape space with backslash.

Now to recognize image,


$ identify

To recognize audio and video

$ mplayer -frames 0 -identify foo.[avi|mp3] | grep Audio

This is much better than any other easier tool.

identify(1) is part of ImageMagick.

UNIX is an ocean. Be patient. I have been learning, learning and learning.

Thanks. I don't have issues with name servers. Infact, I have Google
nameservers added. Routing seems to be troublesome. Infact some sites
without any names, but just IP addresses (some BSNL Directory lookup
sites) also dont work.

Natarajan,

In my rich networking experience, in fact I have never solved any problems
 as networking problems in my whole life I have never come across
 something like this.

However there are networking troubleshooting boys and certain OpenBSD devs like
 Henning Brauer who play with BGP and SMTP internals.

I am not that caliber but then I am also not a sysadmin of a huge
network to troubleshoot
 a lot.

Still from a programming and troubleshooting angle I do know something
about where what
 could go wrong.

Your problem is bizarre.

It has nothing to do with routing is what I feel.

Probably some firewall, browser or some such thing.

If ping does not work, then your MODEM could be broken, your
switch/hub could be worn out,
 your computer's NIC, it could be anything.

Best of luck.

Snegan,

Are you talkin in some alien tongue eh?

It is ludicrous language. Do something or you will be a
 laughing stock although it might not directly affect your career.

Alright now for your queries.

To monitor signal strength, you could use iwconfig or something.
 I don't use Linux.

Okay as to video combining and DVD ripper no better tool
 than mencoder.

Usually English skills are a reflection of one's IQ, most think
 that vocab is directly related as it relates to memory and
 comprehension.

That is largely true although IQ is not important for life. Wisdom is.

And maturity.

If you are not very attentive to detail, your English grammar will
 not be good and you can't do much in UNIX either.

Sorry for being negative, only a friendly remark connecting the dots.

Your battle is good, victory even better.

CDMA is a very good standard.

Even with poor signal strength, the spread spectrum algorithms will
 give you excellent throughput.

Thanks to Andrew Viterbi.

Well, this documentation seems to be concise enough:
http://www.dslreports.com/faq/695

The following is what *think* might have happened.
MTU is largest size of each packet. The default value is 1500. But
seems like this size is too big for some networks. When I observed
more closely, some sites just didn't load at all. The othersites (such
as thehindu & slashdot), start to load, and they keep waiting for
ever. The site has been waiting indefinitely for some content to be
loaded from other domains whose routes accept smaller than 1500.
That's why some sites stopped loading midway, while others never
loaded at all.

No it isn't. It's just a good documentation for others who might also
face a similar problem.

2. I couldn't relate the symptoms with the cause.

Did you try using network manager? If your signal strength drops (below
threshold) in between there may be disconnection problem.

Actually the issue is more like this:

The link between your DSL modem and DSLAM (other end ISP equipment
your DSL modem connects to) uses encapsulated PPP - it's either PPP over
Ethernet or ATM.

Since 1500 is the MTU on Ethernet networks, when you add PPPoA/E
the packet size increases due to encapsulation overhead.

PPPoE add 8 bytes overhead. So the MTU should be 1492 bytes to
ensure that even after adding encapsulation overhead you are still
at the 1500 byte MTU limit.

* I don't use BSNL to verify, so please let us know if MTU 1492 works for you.

Note that the same issue is present when you use VPN tunnels - you
need to use a lower MTU on the tunnel to accommodate VPN overhead.

There are a couple of ways around manual MTU setting:

Routers can fragment and reassemble packets so that they can pass through
packets with smaller MTU sizes, but this has a lot of overhead. In fact it has
so much overhead that IPv6 does not support fragmentation/reassembly.
It simply drops the packet, sends a "packet to big" ICMP error condition.
This forces sender/receiver to perform path MTU discovery.

Sites which load are successfully able to perform path MTU discovery
so they automatically discover the lower MTU on your DSL modem.

To be certain use "tracepath" which is similar to traceroute but reports
the path MTU at each hop. It will be great to see the tracepath output
for your various websites.

Subject: [Ilugc] Fast and Lightweight Desktop Recorder in Fedora 16
Message-ID: <CACm7z1Ys2SPK9bmpCHEM65bPV+Bh4JoXqkDBtUJZ6eONiX-dig@mail.gmail.com>

Dear folks,

I was in need of a Lightweight and a fast rendering Desktop recording
utility to use in fedora and i came across a Command line utility named
BYZANZ, released under GPLV3 license and hosted under gnome git repository.

This can be directly downloaded as fedora package and installed in the
system.

To install it in Fedora 16:
su -
yum install byzanz

To use it:
byzanz-record --duration=60 -c -a testing.webm

The above command will record the desktop for 60 Seconds and traces the
cursor wherever it moves with audio enabled and renders it in webm format.

Written a blog post on the same here:-

Subject: [Ilugc] SQL tutorial part II
Message-ID: <CALDskywohFY3enT7AGLVfhu6_XGyjCA7Hz3VPCrCPLx8LV2aow@mail.gmail.com>

We see SQL now.

We saw a bit yesterday.

By the way, my projects were featured in LinuxToday.

http://www.linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2011120900239RVOOBD

I have also updated the latest images now.

http://liveusb-openbsd.sf.net

http://livecd-openbsd.sf.net

It started as a fun project 3 years ago, hopefully it will get
somewhere with time.

Now for SQL.

SQL is structured query language.

You can query a database/table in various ways.

It is like saying:

What all questions can you ask from an answer?

Right?

So if you have data organized in multiple columns and rows, you can
 operate on the matrix in very many ways.

SQL allows you all the flexibility you need.

Really cool.

Columns are sorted with the first argument to the select command.

Rows are selected as the last argument.

You can say.

sqlite> select id from marks where name = "rahim";

Or

sqlite> select phy from marks where distinct phy;

The great thing about SQL is that you can order the results, automatic sorting,
maximum, minimum and average computation comes with batteries.

Like python. ;)

sqlite> select max(phy) from marks;

It is amazing.

Now I did not say why we specify NULL as the first argument when we insert?

It is an auto increment primary key ID value.

Very good to have on all tables you create.

The table is indexed that way and stored internally to do quick searches against
 this field.

As I said, every row/record/data set is a key value pair.

And in our case as is true in most , the key is the id and the entire row is
 the set of values.

We can also have multiple keys, called tertiary and secondary keys.

Which can index faster and perform searches for us. You can also join
tables but
 I normally don't do it as it helps us combine multiple SQL tables.

Now let us talk about database.

A database contains multiple tables.

And you can also have any number of databases.

But let us not complicate.

Any fool can complicate things. Let us simplify.

SQL helps us do complex arithmetic on data without you having to write a lot of
 buggy unpredictable code.

In my product SpamCheetah I use SQL everywhere I want to retrieve user
stats like

1) How many attachments were totally received?

2) How many mails from who to who?

3) How many rejections were due to SPF mismatch?

And any arbitrary question user can come up with.

Your creativity alone is the limit.

How?

Using SQL and sqlite.

But of course the backend is build using CGI, Perl and C code.

And UNIX domain sockets.

You can build a web form to do a backend SQL query and return to the user.

This will look like magic.

If you have a website and do this, people will think you are a mini google. :)

Okay that is taking it a bit far.

This has been an issue for a long time now. Many sites do not open as
packets get dropped when encapsulation happens. It is seen more often
when you have control connections getting dropped. PPP control
connections is one such case.

I've also noticed this more often in sites that are served out of
large web farms/ CDNs which have some kind of indirection/ reverse
proxy. LinkedIn is a standing example.

Apologies for replying to my own post. To get rid of this problem
across networks that I move in and out of, I've set my ethernet MTU to
1300 ( a safe number) to account for a few encapsulated hops.

Julia is a new language for scientific computing that is winning
praise from a slew of very smart people, including Harlan Harris,
Chris Fonnesbeck, Douglas Bates, Vince Buffalo and Shane Conway. As a
language, it has lofty design goals, which, if attained, will make it
noticeably superior to Matlab, R and Python for scientific
programming. In the core development team?s own words:

    We want a language that?s open source, with a liberal license. We
want the speed of C with the dynamism of Ruby. We want a language
that?s homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp, but with obvious,
familiar mathematical notation like Matlab. We want something as
usable for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as R,
as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear
algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell.
Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious
hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled.

I like "j".

It's open source, good with arrays, elegant, and so
concise that it can improve programmer
productivity about 10x.

For example, you can write a really small function
to calculate the average of a list of numbers:

  $ avg=: +/ % #

Run it with

  $ avg 1 2 3 4
2.5

It's like apl with a normal keyboard.

Not just performance, it is also damn good in `readable` code

The subtle connection of this sample code  in their page to their namesake
`Julia`(sets) is super cool :)
Julia sets are curves/point sets in fractal planes (planes with fractal
dimensions - how cool is a 2.46 dimension - A human mind can only interpret
integer dimensions, this is 1D, 2D and 3D spaces) which satisfies a
limiting function.
That limiting function is:

function mandel(z)
    c = z
    maxiter = 80
    for n = 1:maxiter
        if abs(z) > 2
            return n-1
        end
        z = z^2 + c
    end
    return maxiter
end

The readability of this code is incredible. Considering the variables `c`
and `z` are complex numbers with real and imaginary coefficients.

Regards,
Arun

It would be nice to see something like Jacket (The CUDA lib for
Matlab) for this language. Intel's MKL might be fast, but I doubt if
it can number crunch like the GPU. 

That could actually be a good project just in case someone is looking
for one.

P.S. One thing I got out of this thread is a reference to the book

It would be great if it could use GPU also to do the math (CUDA or OpenCL
will be good).

Yes this is true for deeply embedded systems running without os or
small RTOS. But now days, in the world of linux, the line is just
merging. With Embedded Linux you can virtually do anything what a
desktop does, except things will be slow because of low processing
power limited by the hardware. And thus to limit it, just
cross-compiled what is need the application needed and will be
carefully choosing what is need + additional softwares which will not
hang the system.

yes. this is the reason why swap is not in embedded linux. But if you
wish you can have it. In my point of view, every thing is embedded
systems from wrist watch to super computer and desktop is a special
case. And even in the desktop if you wish you can remove swap
partition. Please see this link, it says why swap is need.

Did you setup forward zone and reverse zone entries for all ubuntu
computers in the DNS server?

If you are using GNOME 3 it is enabled by default. If you are using MSGE
use ccsm to enable it.

Hope this helps.

Actually forward & reverse zones are configured in the DNS servers. I can't
able to access my DNS server since there is no control for me. But when I
try to search in Active directory I can able to see the ubuntu machine in
the server OU. Hope I assume there will be an A record for the ubuntu
machine also.

In Windows PC, if i enter the DNS address in the TCP/IP properties the
netbios name resolve perfectly even the machine not in the member of
domain. What configuration requires in linux machine to work like windows
machine.

I hope it is not stated while the system starts ..
You can start manually by typing
ibus-daemon
in terminal.

To enable in all applications, place .bashrc file in home folder with
content,
export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
export XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus
export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus

It is more of a sales pitch by Linux Foundation than anything else. Skip it!

Is there any way to use a Android mobile (with touch screen) as a graphics
tablet? Technically it is possible but my concern is whether such
application already exists? I am not going to use this for designing (like
working with GIMP etc). I want to take notes while reading books so even
capacitive touch will be enough (no need for stylus or very pixel perfect
drawing).

Install an app in Android mobile or tablet that will capture touch events
and send the co-ordinates to Linux system using USB or some other
interface. The co-ordinates are then captured by Linux and used to draw or
write.

There are 2 ways to implement this in Linux side - a input driver can be
written or a app specific to this can be written. If implemented as a input
device then it will work with many applications this will be a big
advantage (but writing a input driver may need good knowledge). The second
option will be easy to implement but restricts the user to only one
application.

I would like to use this with jarnal application. Jarnal is open source so
it can be modified to read the co-ordinates data obtained from the Android
device.

Thanks in advance.

I think for the requirement you specified, you can also think about a Pen
mouse.

May be you can get a clone of it in the market for cheaper price.

Hai guys,

My request for adding Tamil language in DuckDuckGo.com has been accepted.
Starting this evening, I will translate atleast 10 words a day. If you are
interested, please join me. You can either translate tokens or vote on
others' translations in a good looking UI. There is only less than 100
tokens there.

If you are interested:
1. Create a free account at dukgo.com
2. Then add Tamil to your languages here: https://dukgo.com/my/languages
3. Translate the tokens here:

As Raja indicated, problem may be due to the packet fragmentation and
https sites will throw some issues. As Mohan suggested, we can set the
MTU to 1300.  OR You can find the safe number, by running the
following ping command.

$ ping -M do -s 1510 google.com

You need to reduce the packet size, till you get the ICMP reply
with-out DF bit set.

resending as this does not seem to have hit the list

hi,

I had a big problem. I was staying with some relatives, and convinced
them to try out linux on their brand new Dell desktop. So I wiped out
doze 7 and tried to install fedora 16 from DVD. Failed miserably. They
have a cable internet connection where one has to authenticate through a
browser. Fedora was refusing to install without internet and I could not
configure the network without a browser. This was in Hyderabad and the
service provider was beam. Got egg on my face. doze 1 linux 0.

So my question is: can one install Fedora without internet - and if not is there a distro
 that can be installed without internet

         You can install Debian without Internet. But better to have
the first DVD(instead of just the 1st CD) handy. But if  you are
comfortable with command line for common tasks, CD is good enough.

Are you sure of this? I installed Fedora 16 on one of machine
yesterday and I pretty well remember that it didn't have the LAN cable
connected till I wanted to download the latest updates.

It must be possible to install Fedora without internet connection. I had
done this before (Fedora 10, 11, 12). I did not try with new versions but
there is no need for internet connection during installation. I think there
is some other problem that is hindering the installation.

It may be telling something similar to "no internet found it is recommended
to have internet connection for getting latest update" -  there may be a
yes, no icon where you choose yes to stop the installation (sometimes
choosing yes may be a negative response). If that is the case try choosing
other option. I have seen such things in Linux so do read things carefully.
Pardon me if what I said is wrong.

how many dvds and cds does one need for debian? And is it ok for basic
doze users (people who struggle to upgrade from vista to 7)?

Normally First DVD is enough. You get Openoffice, vlc player, browsers etc., with it.

          For a basic use(browsing/office suite/music/movie) first DVD
is enough. It is ok for anyone. Irrespective of the distro, it will
take a while to get used to the new UI. After that, it is would be
simple. Thanks

Upto  Fedora 15 we can install without internet, but at 16 i was stuck.
So i gone through the live option.

But got a fix later, it worked for me.
add the *repo=/dev/sdX/<path-to-repo>* on the kernel boot line

kenneth gonsalves <lawgon at thenilgiris.com> states :: "Fedora was
refusing to install without internet and I could not
configure the network without a browser."

Did you try using a live CD ? You get a browser without having to
install one.

I dont understand the basic problem. I have installed Linux (Suse,
Slackware, Ubuntu ) many times in places where there are no Internet
access. Maybe, we wont get the extra repositories. But the basic system
will install and work.

In our eagerness to show  the power of Linux we make the one big blunder
which one should avoid at all cost. Take a backup first. And, if it is
just to show how Linux works, start with a live CD.
This is a lesson for all of us.

Better luck next time Mr.  Gonsalves.

after partitioning the disk it *requires* configuring the network.
Cancel does not work. If it cannot find the internet, the install is
aborted - I did this 12 times, and found no buttons to tell it to
install it without internet.

I am very surprised to see this goof up by fedora - I know quite a few
people working for Redhat in India, and most of them are sensible people
from small town/rural background. They seem to have forgotten their
roots and think that India is like foreign ;-) Anyway fedora has no
future in the villages and small towns and in the poorer schools unless
they wake up and rectify this.

      May be an oversight. But can you please log a bug ? May be they
haven't yet noticed and that would help them. Thanks

I have been installing various distros without internet - without even
lan cards since 1994. This is the first time I have failed. Later in the
installation process, one is allowed to choose to install from the
locally mounted repo, but you *need* internet to reach this stage.

When installing Fedora-16 from DVD, after getting the fedora welcome
screen, immediately switch to second terminal and remove the repo files
under the

/etc/anaconda.repos.d/  directory and proceed with the installation
normally.  It won't wait for internet connection.

When booting from the DVD, after skipping the media test, you get the
language selection screen.

Here, press Ctrl+Alt+F2 and get to the terminal

cd to /etc/anaconda.repos.d/ directory

remove

fedora.repo
fedora-updates.repo
fedora-updates-testing.repo

now, switch back to GUI using Alt+F6 and continue with the installation.
It won't wait for network/internet connection for remaining process.

The above said problem exists from Fedora-15 onwards.

Once the partition is done, the network gets activated and the repo files
under /etc/anaconda.repos.d/ points to mirrors.fedoraproject.org for
getting the packages required for installation.

The only way to get rid of this problem is to remove those repo files
before partitioning or at the beginning of the installation (this can be
done by switching to the terminal using Ctrl+Alt+F2).

This problem also occurs during kickstart based installation.  So, for
those who do kickstart based installation using Fedora-15/16 has to include
the following pre-installation-script in the kickstart file to remove the
repo files. (else it won't read your repo URLs in the kickstart file).

%pre
#!/bin/bash

echo "Pre-processing"
rm /etc/anaconda.repos.d/* -rf
echo "Removed /etc/anaconda.repos.d/*"
%end

Hi,

         We have been using Dokuwiki for our internal documentation.
Now, we are moving to a new server and would want to migrate the data
in the wiki. I am aware of a backup plug-in. But that doesn't let me
restore the contents :). There is a round about way to untar-ing the
backup in proper paths. But, what is the suggested way to take a dump
and restore it on the new server? Thanks

Doesn't dokuwiki just consist of flat files? It should just involve
copying the data folder, whatever the correct name is, to the new
wiki. And then whatever else you want to copy over, everything should
be in the respective files.

       Thanks for the responses. I will try it out and get back if I
run into issues :) But, I would also want to preserve the history of
changes . I guess it uses CVS or somthing similar(I see a folder named
"attic" in the dir). So,  when I copy the folder, will that also get
preserved ? Thanks

I remember facing this problem with fedora net install but an older
distro ( 13 I guess)  . I was also supposed to get the network sorted
out to proceed any further .
But I also had   to go through some authentication which I would be
comfortable doing on a GUI .
I reset the router to give  me a plain DHCP connection , then
everything worked smooth .

Hello and hi,

I did a 6 day workshop on the topic "web programming with foss tools" at
IIIT -Gothapatna - Bhubaneswar - Odissa - India between 30th of March 2012
and 4th of April 2012.

There were  70 participants actively participated in this exercise. Out of
the 6 days, 2 days the classes were conducted till 12 am(yes 12 am i mean
the mid night)The event was a grand success.

Prior to the start of this workshop ,I requested the event organiser
Mr.Bishnu patra to see that Ubuntu is kept ready on all the students
machine,which he did.

There were bandwidth issues when 70 students accessing internet through
wifi router (a kind of bsnl router we have it in our home), even sudo
apt-get update took so much of  time,
so asked the last row people to come forward near the router to have better
access and get the installation done faster.
We worked with ubuntu -10.04/11.04 versions in all the terminal and xampp
for lamp stack support.
I taught the students how to install ruby on rails through rvm and through
a conventional style of apt-get install ruby-full.
This installation process for around 50 machines for all the 70
participants seems to a kind of problem because of the bandwidth.
you can see that wifi bandwidth struggle here in this photo
http://openvidya.fossfactory.in/workshops/index.php/Workshop-on-web-programming-using-foss-tools-held-at-IIIT-Bhubaneswar-Gothapatna-Odissa-India/struggle

I have documented the content of the course line up at
http://openvidya.fossfactory.in/course.html .

You can see some photos which we took on the last day of workshop at
http://openvidya.fossfactory.in/workshops/index.php/Workshop-on-web-programming-using-foss-tools-held-at-IIIT-Bhubaneswar-Gothapatna-Odissa-India

I thank the college administration and all the people(in particular
Mr.Bishnu patra - Chairman of IIIT technology club) who helped in
organising the event and making it as a grand success, I thank T.Shrini of
ilugc for bring up this enquiry to me.

Jai Hind,

I am not sure if this is applicable here, however Java version below
1.6.0.30 and 1.7.2 are vulnerable to attacks.  Install 1.6.0.31.

There are two ways to avoid this and automate your installation.

1. simple solution, use rpm or deb package for  jdk installation instead of
self extracting installation(./jdk-6u21-linux-i586.bin).

2. create a dummy file called input with one empty line and redirect it
during installation.
       echo "" >input
       ./jdk-6u21-linux-i586.bin < input

preferred method for automated installation is rpm or deb package based on
your distro.

jdk deb packages will prompt for user input for accepting license
agreement and it is not straight forward to automate it.

Hi,

I was searching for alternatives of Damn Small Linux (DSL), and found a gem
called Tiny Core Linux.
http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/

It has it's own packaging system and is awesome.
Base ISO is only 8MB and a X with basic stuff comes in 12MB!

It was really useful for me to create small appliance with this. Runs on
QEMU very well.
Thought I would share this with the list.

regards,
Arun

Message-ID: <CACm7z1aEZY5RTqM-pXRs0RijoiBej2jhER2Asg32Qf=axDOBnA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends,

Cricket Season and fever started. So got an idea of developing a small
application (Free Software - GNU GPL Licensed) using Python + Tkinter.
I have named it as "Gilly Cricket".

Motivation (he he :p)
When i was using my laptop at college - cricket match being telecasted -
unable to watch from college - friend of mine having mobile phone -
connected via Bluetooth and used DUN profile to get Internet access - much
slower to get scores via webpages - Nurtured idea to develop this.

Hosted at Github.com
https://github.com/PrasannaVenkadesh/GillyCricket

Cross-platform support. I request to go through README file before
executing or installing.

Looking for feedbacks. Basic version, so not more feature or information
will be fetched. Will improve it based on your suggestions and feedbacks!

I included zip files for Windows binary, since py2exe generates binaries
and support files to run python files without having python installed in
the windows. Since there were number of support files. I zipped it and
uploaded it. Can you suggest me if there are any other way to that?

\--

You will need to make a release for it from the sources, and ship the
release files as a separate binary (like .rpm, or .deb).

While you can provide support in your sources to build different
binaries, there is no use to store binaries when it differs between
platforms and architectures.

Today it is only these binary files, but, tomorrow it can be for other
platforms and architectures. If a person is interested in only, say
ARM architecture, why would they want to get the binaries for all the
platforms from the sources?

If one wants to build for a specific architecture, they can get the
source and build it themselves, or they can use the separate binary
that you release.

Keep the sources clean, and not taint with binaries.

\--

You will need to read through the terms and conditions of the SMS
service provider before you agree and sign up for the service. For
example:

  http://www.smsglobal.com/global/en/information/terms.php

BSNL also provides bulk SMS options:

  http://bsnl.co.in/service/sms.html

\--

Even if you interface only with a *nix system, eventually it is the
service provider who delivers the SMS. So, choosing the right plan and
agreement is important.

SK

P.S.: I have not used the above mentioned services, and I don't work
for them either.

 cat zlib.c
#include <zlib.h>
int main(){
printf("%s", (zlibVersion()));
}

gcc zlib.c -lz -o zlib-test
zlib.c: In function ?main?:
zlib.c:3:1: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in
function ?printf? [enabled by default]

shrinivasan at shrinivasan-ThinkPad-T410:~/test$ ./zlib-test
1.2.3.4


So, zlib is there.

Then why the dhvani can not find it?

Did anyone compiled dhvani in latest ubuntu?

Dear all,

Ganesh Katrapati forked GillyCricket project and added a new file called
"GillyLive.py" which fetches the score in regular interval of time and
displays it using system notifications alone (does not require GUI
packages).

README file format changed to MARKDOWN. So it looks decent now than before
:-)

Thanks for Ganesh Katrapati and looking for more contributions from others
too. If you get new ideas, please feel free to fork it, add it. Ideas are
also most welcome.

Check both repository here:-
1. My Repo:- https://github.com/PrasannaVenkadesh/GillyCricket
2. Ganesh Katrapati's repo:- https://github.com/neshkatrapati/GillyCricket

Just installing libgsm1-dev disappear "cannot find zlib header" error for
me. I just conformed in Ubuntu 11.10.

It seems it looks gsm.h header file and reports cannot find zlib header.

Hi,

Thanks for the info.
I installed libgsm1-dev and the zlib error disappeared.

But, now soundtouch is giving errors.

Check the outout of ./configure here.
http://paste.ubuntu.com/924408/

output and error of make is here.
http://paste.ubuntu.com/924409/

$apt-cache search soundtouch
libsoundtouch-dev - Development files for the sound stretching library

-- runtime files
libsoundtouch-ocaml-dev - OCaml bindings for the sound stretching

libsoundtouch0-dbg - Debugging symbols for the sound stretching library
liquidsoap-plugin-soundtouch - audio streaming language -- Soundtouch plugin
soundstretch - Stretches and pitch-shifts sound independently
libsoundtouch1c2 - sound stretching library

Installed all the above.

Still the make is seeking for some soundtouch library.

Did you compile dhvani successfully?

Hi,

I have had a recent malware injection on a WordPress website I host.

The malware sample is here: http://pastebin.com/7X9imPGp

Can anyone decipher what this script is doing and how much damage
it has caused?


This stuff appeared in several files in my WP installation, new files
created inside wp-includes/css/<long-string>/, and in
wp-includes/Text/Dos/<junk-website-name>/.

I've had 2 incidents during the first incident one directory contained a
full mock up of Amazon Germany website with drive-by downloads
and my web account was used to send phishing emails to this URL.

This is the 2nd attempt and I have greatly limited the damage caused
as I had tightened WP security.

If anyone is interested I can upload the entire website with all the infected
files for review.

- Raja

Do a clean build from top directory. I seems 'autotools' messed-up
somewhere in previous compilation.

1. make distclean
2. make all

Sorry to reply to my own post.  PHP programmers have nothing
other than eval and base64_encode to hide their code.

This malware contains a crafty way of hiding the base64_decode
and eval function strings. Other than that it's vanilla.

The really long string $m1nWMtcRk07 is just several wrappers of
eval(base65_encode(...)). The final unwrapped code is here:

http://pastebin.com/RdTmZKyw

Looks like the GetMama malware is well known.

This code is the first line of ~ 850 php files in my WP installation.
Hope deleting it permanently removes the bad bits.

If there's sufficient interest, at the May LUG meeting I can talk
about my WP experience, hardening and malware analysis.

Hi Srini,

I assume you have installed libsoundtouch-dev, libsoundtouch0 library.

Try the above suggested by Mohan R. If you have still problem. Try this in
your top source directory :

$ make distclean
$ aclocal
$ libtoolize
$ autoconf
$ automake -a
$./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

Sometimes you don't need to run libtoolize manually. automake -a will run
it for you.

Thanks
Mohan L

One often tends to misspell sourceforge as sourceforget. ;)

Anyway if any of you can start some open source project which become successful
 over a period of time it is a matter of pride, fame and in some rare
cases also
 money.

In my case LiveUSB project was featured in linuxtoday and it has been
up for around 3 years.

It brings some 3 inquiries in a month or so, but none commercial.

Recently I got some cash but that is not a regular thing.

Overall sourceforge is  a good way/place to showcase your
project/creation and you can
use that to create more links and traffic to your website.

And in addition you can get some interest in your work.

Sourceforge also is a great place to host your project. Nice tools and
good hosting.

You get a domain for free, easy to use tools for publishing projects.

I stopped using sourceforge several years back - at that time it was
slow, buggy and a huge pain - it had only cvs! Nowadays most people have
migrated to github or bitbucket.

I guess SMS like those are sent from internet and not from mobile phones.
Correct me if I am wrong.

Message-ID: <CAE5=Udtv_jXeCSppTOOuD6h76SGRqEg9aMMVKQ7OgVwYgL19fw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been trying to look up event logging in Linux. But I don't seem to
find explanations to certain things.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424

for e.g. What is a "Facility"? What are local0, local1 etc.

Can someone point me in the right direction? Maybe a link in plain English?

Thanks in advance.

Facility is basically ..ok leave it.

Excerpt from man page syslog.conf on OpenBSD:

------------
 The facility describes the part of the system generating the message, and
     is one of the following keywords: auth, authpriv, cron, daemon, ftp,
     kern, lpr, mail, mark, news, syslog, user, uucp and local0 through
     local7.  These keywords (with the exception of mark) correspond to the
     similar ``LOG_'' values specified to the openlog(3) and syslog(3) library
     routines.

     The level describes the severity of the message, and is a keyword from
     the following ordered list (highest to lowest): emerg, alert, crit, err,
     warning, notice, info and debug.  These keywords correspond to the
     similar (LOG_) values specified to the syslog library routine.
-----------

Try this:

$ logger -t girish 'how r u'

Basically you can specify the filters for logging various facilities and
 their associated levels in /etc/syslog.conf

mail.*              /var/log/maillog
daemon.*        /var/log/daemon

And you can look at the perl Sys::Syslog module.

A typical C syslog program goes like:

openlog("girishcode", LOG_PERROR | LOG_PID, LOG_LOCAL0);

syslog(LOG_INFO,"Started code");

The syslog() function takes vararg arguments just like printf.

I think, this would be illegal copying and distribution. It is best if 
we can get it through baskar.

It'd be illegal to copy creative content from television. This is news.

I do not think I will live that long! It is not a breach of copyright to
quote extracts of a creative work for the purpose of review or citation,
but it is certainly a breach to publish the whole of it or substantial
portions of it. This has been settled law for probably over a 100 years.

True. But that depends on whether news is considered creative work by the
law!

presentation of news is a creative work - the news itself may not be.
The fact that Baskar is a huge asset to open source in TN is news and
may be published, but the interview as presented is a creative work.

Santhitha Velai can be classified as news but it is primarily a talk 
show. Considering, not every talk show brings in the same guests, it can 
be classified as creative work.

Never thought of it at this angle. So, this should automatically imply that
"ALL" of the broadcast/telecast news (with the exception of maybe
government channels) are all restricted with copyright, right?? *The world
is a bad bad place*

On a side note, I'm also wondering what's so "creative" about presenting
news! :)

yes - government will also not only use the copyright act but also the
official secrets act and the goonda act.

Try being a journo for a day.. Take care of people's sentiments, and
prepare yourself backlashes... Decide what you want to censor and what
not to. Read about how the news was presented on the day "Mahatma" was
killed. And always be politically correct.

There you go. you have now become very very creative :-)

Do you know the cost of running a television studio? You expect them to
spend the money and give you their content free of cost?

Do you know the number of technical and non technical people involved in

Friends.

Let us stop here.

Yes. the TV show is creative work with includes many people's hardwork.
It is not right to record it without their permissions.

It is my mistake to ask for recording.

I am trying to get in touch with kalaignar tv people for getting the video.
If possible, they can give it.

Will update you soon.

If it was a movie or a talk show  then it can be re run by the creators
with support from sponsors and advertisements. If it's news, more often
than not, it's one time, or atleast   a one day show, after which I don't
see how it can ever be used apart from reference purposes. So yes, I was
expecting the world to give me free beer.. Or at least the empty bottle.
I'm not asking for content that entertains, I am asking for news.

No, I don't. Please enlighten.

Thanks for the detailed steps.

But, when called dhvani to read any text file, getting the following error.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Good point, I want to create an online page-flip style...  Its for college
magazine, with 182 Page, with a Size of 360+MB ( High Quality PDF)  so an
offline tool for conversion is most appreciated.

While posting bug in mailing list please try to give more information to
reproduce error.

I have compiled dhvani in my Ubuntu to help your previous configuration
issue. I just tried some thing like  :

$ dhvani -t "????????"
Segmentation fault

I am not sure why it is reporting the run time error: Segmentation fault. I
used strace and gdb to trace the issue.

I took strace :

$strace dhvani -t "????????"

open(NULL, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND, 0666) = -1 EFAULT *(Bad address)*
fstat64(8, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0664, st_size=35818, ...}) = 0
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) =
0xb27d4000
read(8,
"\21\0\31\0Q\0h\0{\0f\0Q\0T\0;\0i\0\265\0\276\0\276\0\237\0|\0z\0"...,
8192) = 8192
brk(0x9156000)                          = 0x9156000
---* SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) @ 0 (0) ---
+++ killed by SIGSEGV +++*
Segmentation fault

Then I used gdb to see what is the problem :


$ gdb dhvani

[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
[New Thread 0xb37cbb70 (LWP 7191)]

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0xb7e7a3e5 in fwrite () from /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6


See the above output. It through  the SIGSEGV signal from the operating
system. This means that I am trying to access an invalid memory address.
Let's take a backtrace:

(gdb) backtrace
*#0  0xb7e7a3e5 in fwrite () from /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6*
#1  0xb7fb34a3 in process_pitch_tempo (options=0x804c3f8,
inputfile_name=0x8071da8 "/tmp/dhvani-st7188", output_filename=0x0)
    at soundtouch_utils.c:136
#2  0xb7fb83b6 in process_sound () at synthesizer.c:1646
#3  0xb7fb8936 in speak_text (text=0xbffff4eb "????????", usr_language=-1)
at synthesizer.c:1905
#4  0xb7fb8c45 in text_to_speech (string=0xbffff4eb "????????",
dhvani_opts=0x804c3f8) at synthesizer.c:1986
#5  0xb7f9dcd3 in dhvani_say (string=0xbffff4eb "????????",
options=0x804c3f8) at dhvani_lib.c:74
#6  0x08048c6e in main (argc=4, argv=0xbffff334) at dhvani.c:198

The above output says fwrite() call in glibc reports Segmentation fault.
so I want to switch to stack frame 1 and see where the program crashed:

(gdb) frame 1
#1  0xb7fb34a3 in process_pitch_tempo (options=0x804c3f8,
inputfile_name=0x8071da8 "/tmp/dhvani-st7188", output_filename=0x0)
    at soundtouch_utils.c:136
136                    fwrite(buffer, sizeof(short), read_count, out);


the program crashed inside the call to fwrite() and also note the address
of output_filename : it is output_filename=0x0  , output_filename pointing
invalid address.

(gdb) print out
$1 = (FILE *) 0x0

the value of out is 0x0, which is the NULL pointer. This is not what we
want - out should be stdout/output file. It indicates that I have to pass
proper output file to store output.

then I tried with output file name :

$ dhvani -t "????????"  -o first.wav

Now it works for me.

Your problem may be something else. But this the way to get idea of why it
is giving Segmentation fault.

Hi,

On the onset itself let me make it clear that my legal knowledge is next to
nothing.
I did a research on finding a way to get a copy of a  television show
transmitted and the rules governing it to make available to a community.
Please visit
http://aime.org/news.php?download=nG0kWaN9ozI3plMlCGD%3D&u=691231060000 for
more information about the law.
I am not sure is this  applicable to the Indian jurisprudence .
If that said in the document is okay for local laws,  we can play that
interview in the upcoming ilugc meeting.
Legal fraternities in this list  may shower some light on it.

cheers,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

If something is useful and not too valuable you can share it on youtube. ;)

It is like mp3 sharing between friends that Napster came up with.

LUG can be said to be a community of closely knit friends.

I have uploaded many TV shows in youtube and I have not got sued yet.

To: Fedora India <india at lists.fedoraproject.org>


Hi

Is anyone interested in helping lead Ask Fedora? The following tasks
needs to be done on a regular basis:

* Update and test Askbot whenever there is a new upstream release

* Coordinate with Kevin Fenzi (nirik in #fedora-admin) for deploying to
staging instance and test it for regressions, flesh out new features etc

* Deploy to production instance after testing. Having some knowledge of
Puppet would help in doing this task but if not coordinate with Kevin
for this as well

* Developing or coordinating development of new features useful for Ask
Fedora.  Python and Django knowledge would be useful for this step but
not mandatory

* Develop policies for moderators, helping out as a admin for Ask Fedora
and keeping an eye on the forum in general, including unanswered
questions.

* Last but not the least, participate in the forum itself but asking or
answering questions.

You can delegate some of these tasks and do it as a team.  Let me know
if you want to take over.  I will still be involved to whatever extend I
can but I would like to hand off primary responsibilities to someone
else and focus on other things at the moment.  Thanks.

Rahul

I can not get any information from the string
*Remote_Desktop_Viedo_Application_Monitering_Tool"

Explain more about the functionality you need.

To: Wikimedia India Community list <wikimediaindia-l at lists.wikimedia.org>


Hey folks,

The Tamil Wikimedia Contest organized by User: Sodabottle and other
members of the Tamil community recently got over. As you are all
aware, it generated over 15,000 media files and got over 250 new
contributors to Commons. A detailed report was published at
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Tamil_Wikimedians/TamilWiki_Media_Contest/Report

There's also a blog post that we've been working on that takes a peek
at TWMC behind the scenes with inputs from the organizing team. It
might be really useful to any community planning to conduct a similar
events in future. You can read the post here:
http://blog.wikimedia.in/2012/04/17/postcard-from-the-tamil-community/.
It's a great story of how an off-the-cuff conversation between 2
editors resulted in a massive community wide initiative - with
participation of the Tamil community (and other communities) from
across the world, the kind of intense efforts, the use of technology
enablers and last - and most certainly not the least - some fantastic
images (a sample of which can be seen at http://www.tawp.in/r/33zx) ?-
which have now been used to create or improve articles (6122 on Tamil
Wiktionary, 1659 on Tamil Wikipedia and more).

Do go through the story and add comments. ?Please also share it with
others. ?Don't forget to use the images to improve articles on your
Wikipedia! ?(They are all available on Commons at
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:TamilWiki_Media_Contest)

I am thankful to Natkeeran for the wonderful story idea and to
Sodabottle, Logicwiki and others? for your inputs, insights and times!

Regards
Noopur

application for system administration.

There seems to be a program for this: http://linux.die.net/man/1/autorun

Look at this as well: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/autorun

That said, autorun is kind of risky when the user does not know what is
being run automatically. And this feature can be used to run an attack
script. You get the drift.

Subject: [Ilugc] Mr. Baskar of LinuXpert Systems' interview in Kalaignar TV
	y'day
Message-ID: <1529144069.867942.1334745595550.JavaMail.root@mail.kgisl.org>

I had the pleasure of listening to this entire interview. In the first half, Mr. Baskar spoke in detail about the Free Software Movement, Stallman's contributions, the GNU project; the Linux kernel, and then about Torvalds' contribution.

Then he discussed about the collaborative model of software development as opposed to the proprietary model followed by most Corporate companies.

Mr. Baskar then emphasized the strong growth and acceptance of the GNU/Linux Server by most Corporate companies and the various uses it is put to.

In the second half, Mr. Baskar lamented the fact that a kernel and Operating System both of which were born from Academic Institutions is not being taught in Academic institutions in India. He launched a scathing attack on proprietary software companies and the practices which they follow to impose their products in the curriculum to the exclusion of Free and Open Source Software.

He then spoke about how Universities in Tamil Nadu are named after great thinkers like Anna and Periyar; and how they have bowed down to commercial and vested interests these days. He compared the strong efforts taken by the Kerala Govt. to impart FOSS based curriculum beginning from primary school level and above.
---------------

Overall, it was a very pleasing interview, and Mr. Baskar spoke in Tamil quite fluently; and indeed I myself could not follow many of the words which he used. His strong passion and commitment to the cause of Free Software was evident throughout the interview. His humble beginnings and strong self-belief in starting and sustaining his own company based on FOSS were remarkable.

---------------
I had only one major correction for him - he used the phrase 'Copyrighted Software' to describe 'Proprietary Software'. I felt he should've stuck to Proprietary itself; since even Free Software derives its Freedom because of the GPL License; which itself derives its existence from the concept of Copyright.
---------------

All in all, it was a fantastic interview, and I feel ilugc members must congratulate him warmly for his efforts and achievements.

Thanks

I agree that, in the 2nd part I have used the term Copyright software
few times to mean the  proprietary software.

The below quote from www.gnu.org would justify why I have used the
term copyright software for proprietary software.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/

"Proprietary software developers use copyright to take away the users'
freedom; we use copyright to guarantee their freedom. That's why we
reverse the name, changing ?copyright? into ?copyleft.?

good point. But remember that this only applies to software released
under the GPL. A lot of the software we use is released under BSD style
licenses.

The first Millennium Technology Prize was awarded only in 2004. I think, 
it will take a few decades before this thing gets any meaningful. There 
are so many useless awards/prizes these days, I somehow find this to be 
one of them.

IMO, They should have awarded someone who really needed the recognition 
and the award money than these two guys.

Message-ID: <CAMgfUVwXFy-cfbv84J_r0R1STGaQQ2q9q+oq4dtTeXUHE4V4WQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

*PRESS RELEASE*

The notification of the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines)
Rules 2011 in April 2011 has resulted in the creation of a mechanism
whereby intermediaries (such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo, etc) receive
protection from legal liability in return for trading away the freedom of
expression and privacy of users.

The Rules demand that intermediaries, on receiving a complaint that any
content posted online is considered grossly harmful, harassing,
blasphemous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, paedophilic, libelous,
invasive of another?s privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically
objectionable, disparaging, relating or encouraging money laundering or
gambling, or otherwise unlawful in any manner, have to disable the content
within 36 hours of receipt of complaint. The rules also require the
intermediaries to provide the Government agencies information of users
without any safeguards.


Under these Rules intermediaries will be forced to disable any and all
content that falls foul of the incredibly broad and ambiguous criteria laid
above, as non-compliance with such requests will result in their losing the
liability protection afforded to intermediaries. In short, the Rules will
result in private policing of the internet.  Any content that is critical
of state policy, any organization or even any individual could run the risk
of being censored, thanks to the Rules.  The Rules violate the right to
freedom of speech and expression and the right to privacy of citizens
guaranteed by the Constitution of India.


There is no due process of law, any attention to principles of natural
justice or a redressal mechanism for the aggrieved victim, whose content is
taken down.  The Rules are also ambiguous and arbitrary, disjointed,
legislate on disparate areas and are beyond the rule-making power of the
Government.

After the Avnish Bajaj case, the Legislature wanted a safe harbor for
intermediaries with safeguards and not a system of back door censorship for
the Government.  In view of the possible deleterious effects of the Rules,
the Honorable Member of Parliament, Shri P. Rajeeve has moved a statutory
motion to get the aforesaid Rules annulled. This motion has been admitted
and will be coming up before the Rajya Sabha during the second half of the
Budget session of the parliament that starts on 24th of April, 2012.

We urge all MPs to support the annulment motion. We also request the
Government to draft new rules, that will protect our freedom and  privacy,
after holding consultation among all stakeholders.

Further Material:
There is an online petition in favor of the annulment motion at:

I am afraid that is a wrong interpretation.

Its only because free software (GPL+) by virtue of claiming copyright 
only (calling it copyleft), is able to say that the receiver should also 
act in similar a way.

Message-ID: <CAOsBiW8DoHbbbKJRZ6O2YPCs9r9OQstMRXhmnBZWLsduCrnyJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ILUGC!

     Yesterday I got the pleasure of using one of the TN govt.
laptops. I think we all remember the struggle whch we had to take to
make the laptop a dual-boot one. And it has paid off (atleast
partially.)

     Hardware Specs: Intel Pentium Dual Core at 2.3 GHz, 2 GB DDR3 RAM
(upgradable to 8GB), 320 GB Western Digital SATA 2.5" HDD, 14.1"
1366x768 LCD Screen, etc,.

     On the whole the laptop doesn't feel cheap. Its light in weight
thanks to the absence of a DVD drive and Wifi. The keyboard is not
upto Lenovo standards, but it is still much better than most laptop
keyboards. I'm typing this email in this keyboard, and it offers good
feedback.. The display is a 14" 1366x768. It has good brightness but
poor viewing angles and lots of glare, thanks to the glossy finish.
The lack of wifi is a huge disappointment. The battery lasted just
under 3 hours (2:58) while doing light web-browsing and playing music
(max. brightness and max. volume). Overall, the design is good with a
good textured feel. It feels solid to hold, and doesn't have lots of
flex.

     It has a dual boot with Windows 7 Professional and BOSS
GNU/Linux. I haven't tested Windows 7 much. It has a Office 2010
Starter Edition and Microsoft Security Essentials (I doubt if that is
an anti-virus.) It has few educational apps too. Most of the hard-disk
space (~200 GB) is allocated for it. It logs in by default as a root
user.

     The BOSS Linux 4.0, has GNOME 2.30 and OpenOffice.org 3.2. It has
few educational apps like Thirukural and Tamil Keyboard. It also has
the TN govt. textbooks for classes 11 and 12 in .pdf format. I had to
update 8 packages after connecting to the internet. They have just
shifted the top panel to the bottom to make it more "windows-like".
Overall, BOSS works fine and fast.. It has iceweasel and icedove for
web-browsing and mail.

C42 Summer of Code
================

C42 Engineering (website & github) is running a  Summer of Code (SoC),
similar to Google SoC and Ruby SoC. We'd like to know if this would interest
you!

We are collaborating with JRuby project. Charles Nutter and Thomas Enebo
of JRuby have been instrumental in crafting the SoC idea. Note that they are
a part of the Google SoC too.

Various members of the JRuby team are interested in mentoring students in
these potential projects among others:

- enhancing JIT bytecode generation
- building a new internal object representation
- Fiddle library atop either Ruby FFI (in Ruby) or jnr-ffi (in Java).
- Native date implementation to match 1.9.3
- Native pathname implementation to match 1.9.3
- Ripper support in parser

These projects vary widely in scope and difficulty. For example, Charlie
described the Ripper support project this way: "this would be a hard
one...need someone really excellent with parsers." Folks from C42 and the
JRuby team will work with you to come up with a project plan if you're
selected.

We're planning to run the SoC from June to July -- but we're flexible, since
different Universities have different summer vacation schedules.

We have capacity for three students. Each student will earn INR 15,000/mo
for 2 months. Let us know whether you're interested. We can talk!

Dear Bala,

I looked at your snort PDF. Nice presentation.

But I want background theory and usage tips and architecture and use cases.

Instead you have dwelt on installation and configuration, this may be
trivial on OpenBSD.

I want to know how snort can be used to detect youtube access as you have said
 in your talk.

I want to know what all snort can do and how.

Also what is intrusion detection and intrusion prevention?

So far no customer has asked me about IDS but I am sure I will need it if I am
 to build a UTM.

Please educate.

Thanks.

Hi ILUGC!

     IMHO, I think it would have been better for ELCOT to have skipped
Windows and instead put that money into a WiFi chipset. The
educational apps on BOSS Linux seem much lesser than the ones in
Windows. I think that GNOME 2.3 could have looked a lot better. Or,
they should have used Ubuntu LTS/ Linux Mint. Anyway, now that it is
being rolled out, I guess it would be good for us if we start online
spoken tutorials on how to use BOSS instead of Windows.

     I am planning on making a custom distro based on Edubuntu LTS
(12.04) or something similar, for installation on this laptop. Any
ideas?

     What about a 1-day class for this, wherever it gets distributed?

With regards,
~~Kumaran R

I gave a live demonstration of how Snort can detect the word "password"
going in a LAN and I have also shown live demo of how snort can alert us if
some on is trying to access passwd via URL.

I showed this while installing Snort on Ubuntu.  I will try to record Snort
installation when I find time, upload it and I will give the link.

You made two mistakes Bala.

I don't want to know snort's installation. I told you that clearly.

I want you to reply to the list so everyone gets the answer
along with me.

Can you explain the real meat of snort instead of talking only
 about installation in 15 slides when that is not so important?

If I wanted you to tell only to me I would have asked
 you off list. ;)

Okay that is better.

I only want to know what all snort can do and how to configure to get
what we want.

I will take a look at it myself and get back to you.

Keep the communication with the list to benefit the archives and other

Snort installation and auto signature upgrade are really more important
than developing our own signature.

Snort has lots of options to match and catch traffic based on Signature,
You can find almost all the features of snort here on this PDF

Dear friends,

I did adding and my Centos 6.2 to windows 2008 domain and shared a
directory with samba.

Here are the steps I did,

1. Joined my Centos 6.2 with *ext4* file system into our windows 2008
domain using winbind.

2. modified fstab to set acl to the directory which has to be shared

3. Shared that directory via samba with domain with acl options in smb.conf
file

4. Set domain administrator as the owner and domain users are the group.

5. From windows I can able to set permissions.


But the problem I am facing is when I set *write* permission for a user. It
automatically applies the *delete* and *modify* permission for the sub
folders and files.But in our environment, we have to give some users *only
write permission but not delete, modify or rename* including any of the sub
folders and files. For some users* only read* permission, For some users *full
permission but they are not administrators*. Like wise only delete. Please
share your points.

You can not see them as separate partitions like d: or e: using file manager.

you can see them using the following command.

df -h

it will list the mount point the size of the disk.

     I was thinking of the same thing. But I don't think I'd be able
to check that, because this is a borrowed laptop, and opening the case
might not be acceptable. I want the people who own one of these to
find that out.

     Also, I wonder as to why the BOSS people have decided to go with
their own repos. I think it would have been better to use the upstream
Debian repos instead. The BOSS repos are out-dated, for eg. Chromium
is in version 7.

Instead of showing it as a folder windows shows it as D:, E:. There is no
much difference between them. Linux does not use drive letter thing.

In nautilus (the default GNOME file manager) you can see mounted partitions
listed in left pane (if there is no left pane press F9 to get it).

Well Mr. Kumaran, Nice Review
I am a Teaching Computer Science for the past 15 years for the Hr. Sec.
Students.

Kindly consider the following

# The custom distro should "attract" the students
# Unless there is a "syllabus" and "exam" in the school curriculum ,
students will not learn from LINUX
# 95% of the students are only "computer users" not "learner"
# You can not eradicate MS from student's domain

More to come...

Thiagu

Hi ILUGC!

     IMHO, I think it would have been better for ELCOT to have skipped
Windows and instead put that money into a WiFi chipset. The
educational apps on BOSS Linux seem much lesser than the ones in
Windows. I think that GNOME 2.3 could have looked a lot better. Or,
they should have used Ubuntu LTS/ Linux Mint. Anyway, now that it is
being rolled out, I guess it would be good for us if we start online
spoken tutorials on how to use BOSS instead of Windows.

     I am planning on making a custom distro based on Edubuntu LTS
(12.04) or something similar, for installation on this laptop. Any
ideas?

     What about a 1-day class for this, wherever it gets distributed?

With regards,
~~Kumaran R

Do use powertop to see if you can configure some of the tunables.

Thats conventional wisdom. But since you are better placed to try a
contrarian view, could you, as an experiment, tell your students that the
only thing they are expected to do in the computer lab is to 'create'
something they can be proud of at the end of each class - be it a program
that calculates fibonacci numbers or a goggle earth flyby of mount everest
or solving some problems in khanacademy.org or some art using, say,
muro.deviantart.com!! The reward will be having their 'creation' posted to
the school notice board, in your annual souvenier, mailing lists you
follow! You can send the creations to me, I'll put it on my website!

My opinion is to target the 5% who can be pushed further, achieve great
things and bring glory to themselves and the institution. This will
motivate atleast another 5% to follow their lead. Focusing all efforts on
average students makes even the top performers do only average things
because that seems to be enough to get along.

I agree. If MS is not solving a problem it will go out of the market
itself.

     Thank you to all for the replies.

     I am not trying to eradicate MS or anything. Although I would
like to. But in reality, it is nearly impossible. It is possible in a
closed environment, like an office, where the IT manager is a FOSS
enthusiast. But as far as school students are concerned, it is
extremely difficult to remove MS, although I believe it is possible
with the school's help.

     Yes, I agree that 95% of the students are computer users rather
than learners. But GNU/Linux today, especially distros like Ubuntu are
targeted at the end-users rather than learners.

     With my observation, I've seen quite a number of students who are
interested to learn and use GNU/Linux without any exam or curriculum
whatsoever. A recent trend that I've observed among school students is
that some of them have taken GNU/Linux as a status symbol. i.e. They
are proud of using it. And most of these students are not CS students.
They're mostly bio/commerce/economics students. If this trend
continues, I don't think it would be necessary to have GNU/Linux in
the curriculum, with exams and force students to use GNU/Linux.

     Another problem with forcing students to learn GNU/Linux, is that
they would only view it as another burden rather than a OS that would
ease their computer use. This is mostly because, any curriculum based
on GNU/Linux introduces students with the command-line. And most
students are afraid of the command line. This would make them view
GNU/Linux as a step backward from Windows rather than a step-forward.
So, I think it would be best to give the students GNU/Linux, and let
them explore by themselves, probably with a set of Spoken tutorial
DVDs for help.

That is an incorrect assumption made by them, and they will need to
learn to use it to appreciate the power of the command-line.

Hi,

     Yes it is an incorrect assumption made by them. But most of them
still do it. I have personally introduced around 30 of my friends to
GNU/Linux, and most of them still don't use the command line. IMO,
GNU/Linux is not only for CS guys but also for the general public. And
I don't prefer forcing them to use the command-line. I've seen many of
my friends who could have become interested in CS but for their
introduction to C in their 9th and 10th grade. This scares most of
them away from CS.

     I also believe that there is more to GNU/Linux than the command
line. For eg. I want schools to teach computers as tools for education
rather than using them as a subject on its own right. We've lots of
educational tools like GCompris, Stellarium, Step, etc,. I don't think
that the command line would be necessary to make them use this.

     I personally love the command-line, but I don't think it would be
right for most people, who just want their computers to help them,
rather than wanting to learn how it works. For those who are
interested in learning more, can do so with Linux, unlike Windows,
which prevents them from learning.

C is not Bash. You should try to approach CLI from the productivity
point of view and from a comparative perspective.
GUIs are inherently limited.
Productivity of general users will increase if they have more CLI skills.
Of course it will help in programming specific to their domains later on.
People in FOSS development have all kinds of background and a
reasonable understanding of some of the basics helps.

Does the problem exist only with twitter.com ? If so, it is just very 
wierd. It is most likely the MTU issue which we had discussed earlier in 
the list. What service do you use to connect to internet ?

could you clarify why you say 'especially distros like Ubuntu'? What is
lacking in the efforts of distros like fedora, opensuse, Mandriva in
this respect?

You can use Chrome's developer tools to figure out what is going on. See
what happens when Chrome tries to fetch the image file. This can be
found under Network section.

Hi

One of my close associate who is running geoinformatics business is desperately looking for the open source tools available for the maximum possible image compression and effective & secured file transfer tools other than normal ftp,sftp,scp to share the image(high dense) files from their clients. If anybody come across the solution for such requirements, we shall thank them and their help is highly appreciated.

Maximal image compression?

Look for some algorithms that do not lose data like JPEG.

Say 7z or something.

Secure file transfer?

sftp, scp, ftps and https

Djvu is great for lossy image compression
and streaming like with Google Earth.

See djvu.org.

> effective & secured file transfer

Djvu itself has a streaming solution.
Else you can always use rsync.

JPEG is lossy. Unless you are specifically
referring to JPEG 2000 or JPEG LS.

In LUG we are very familiar with people eagerly waiting to do student
 projects, completing office deadlines and doing small projects.

But the real joy of intellectual labor is when we solve real life
problems in real life
 settings for businesses where networking problems will solve his
business issues
, give him peace of mind and also get you some cash in the bargain.

There are very few such questions concerning work that is challenging, real life
 and long term.

Anyway I will now proceed to answer your questions:

You ask two things:

1) Real time embedded systems

2) Wireless configuration in Linux

I only know little bit about wireless and Linux.

Real time embedded systems are basically divided into two:

1) hard real time
2) soft real time

Hard real time embedded systems are mission critical and used in
 surgical equipment, life saving equipment, rocket launching and plane cockpits.

Soft real time embedded systems are used in routers, switches and networking
 equipment where a delay in performing a programming task will not
endanger a life.

There are two types of CPU scheduling broadly speaking.

Pre emptive multi tasking and non pre emptive multitasking.

In pre emptive multi tasking, the running process is forcibly
jettisoned to replace with
 a new process to ensure fair allocation of resources to waiting
processes in the Q.

In non pre emptive multi tasking a  long running process can starve
others since it
 may be a rogue.

In other words non pre emtive multi tasking is democracy in which
rules are lenient.

How does this relate to real time embedded systems?

In embedded systems , say hard real time, you have pre emptive multitasking.

Then there is priority queuing  in which the mission critical
processes like disk I/O, network
 interrupt processing when you receive packets are run at a higher
importance than
 say some music playing or handling user interface.

A real time OS also has other characteristics like low CPU, memory,
secondary storage, no swap,
 usually no MMU(which means not multi processing based), and it will
have power saving needs
 which are usually built into wireless antenna management software.

Now let us talk about wireless.

A wireless transceiver works based on certain characteristics:

1) What is the arbitration protocol for transmitting? Bus arbitration
similar to CSMA/CD on ethernet
 or inside a computer , how the control bus interfaces the peripherals
like memory, CPU, keyboard
 and so on

2) What is the encoding in wireless to transfer data? Say, CDMA(spread
spectrum), QPSK and so on

3) The topology of the network, bus, star, mesh and so on

Okay now the various wireless protocols in vogue are:

1) WiFi 802.11a to i

2) Bluetooth

3) WiMAX

4) IrDA

5) USB wireless for keyboard and mouse interfacing

6) Others like Zigbee probably are built on top of the above

Bluetooth is  low speed wireless and WiFi is the fastest.

Usually wireless is unreliable and fixed wireless between satellite
and earth station and
 between two line of sight microwave towers are the best.

All other wireless technologies suffer from throughput issues.

A programming language helps us practically solve a problem.

For mathematical logical minded engineers which of course every good engineer
should be, a programming language helps you codify a solution and solve a real
 problem.

But most of the problems that I have solved in networking and crypto has not
 involved any programming at all.

It is only based on domain knowledge, reading RFCs, browsing and
understanding the
 domain and through real life testing and thinking.

Programming is a good way to start but what is necessary is thinking and domain
 knowledge to know where to apply what knowledge.

Those are some really interesting figures. It would be nice to see a
split by geographic regions. I am sure 'C' will not be on top in India,
even though I wish it to be. If I had to guess, I would say Java.

         I guess I would agree with Girish on this. What most
people(at least those whom I interact with) think is, programming in
itself is the final goal. In my understanding, programming is the
ability to solve a problem using a computer language. It includes the
design, implementation, tests etc.

        But to design, or do any of the above things, we need to have
a basic understanding of the problem domain. Programming, by itself,
doesn't give that. And again, to design, what is necessary is
thinking, based on the domain knowledge that we have. Thanks

Yes, HTML isn't but Linux is. I believe OP designed it locally on a Windows
machine which is case insensitive so that's where the problem started.

the above two paragraphs contradict each other. I think you are
confusing the knowledge of how to write code (which is what is taught in
our educational institutions) and the solving of problems using
computers. As you have said the latter requires domain knowledge and the
ability to think - the former does not require any ability to think.

that is obvious - I was just pointing out that he got the right solution

Hi,

       When we use the gnome file manager with split pane(what you get
when you do F3), And want to copy a file between the 2 panes, we can
choose the file and then do Edit->Copy To -> Other pane. Is there a
short for this ? Or if there is none, how can we define one ? Thanks

I am not sure I got your question correctly,  However I use to press CTRL +
T for  a  new tab and switch back and forth with ALT +1,2,3.....

CTRL + C & CTRL + V work for me.  I hope this is what you asked.

         No, I meant something different. In the recent versions of
Gnome, you can have 2 parallel panes in nautilus window and have
different directories open in them. I was talking about a single
command to copy files between them. Currently, what I have to do is,
Ctrl+C, Tab(takes to the other pane), Ctrl+V. Thanks

       No, this is for a friend who is comfortable with the GUI. For
me, I either use bash and do a 'cp'. Or, I use emacs dired mode if I
have to find the files and then copy. I tried mc a few years back. Did
not like it then. But will give it a try again. Thanks

I do not use mc either. But certain funny filenames mc deals with them
very well.

I also use mmv and other shell tools.

I don't think anybody uses mutt for mail like me. They think one should use
 a graphical client.

But I find mutt incredibly powerful and convenient.

Subject: [Ilugc] BOSS GNU/Linux - Question
Message-ID: <CACm7z1YPBZ4OvHZLoqeNLS7ca=0ZziRzTAAOrW+JiaXX9ZF+xA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

Can we able to upgrade to new version of BOSS GNU/Linux from already
existing version? Just like we do in ubuntu!

I got this doubt since it is not certain distro like LinuxMint, etc do not
have the Upgrading feature from Existing version rather than Booting live
and upgrading.

Is BOSS also in that list?

Correct me if i am wrong.

Subject: [Ilugc] Ubuntu 12.04 - Precise Pangolin - Released Today
Message-ID: <CAND279778_y=w6niB+RRShpWr5MdH7vOXrw_PdncGcYQsHCYRA@mail.gmail.com>

The Ubuntu team is very pleased to announce the release of Ubuntu
12.04 LTS (Long-Term Support) for Desktop, Server, Cloud, and Core
products.

Codenamed ?Precise Pangolin?, 12.04 continues Ubuntu?s proud tradition
of integrating the latest and greatest open source technologies into a
high-quality, easy-to-use Linux distribution. The team has been hard
at work through this cycle, introducing a few new features and
improving quality control.

To be a bit more precise about what we?re releasing today?
There are 54 product images and 2 cloud images being shipped with this
12.04 LTS release, with translations available in 41 languages.
The Ubuntu project?s 12.04 archive currently has 39,226 binary
packages in it, built from 19,179 source packages, so lots of good
starting points for your imagination!

For PC users, Ubuntu 12.04 supports laptops, desktops, and netbooks
with a unified look and feel based on an updated version of the
desktop shell called ?Unity?, which introduces ?Head-Up Display?
search capabilities. Finding and installing software using the Ubuntu
Software Centre is now easier thanks to improvements in speed, search
and usability.

Ubuntu Server 12.04 has made it much easier to provision, deploy,
host, manage, and orchestrate enterprise data centre infrastructure
services with the introduction of new technologies such as ?Metal as
a Service? (MAAS), the Juju Charm Store, and the latest OpenStack
version, codenamed Essex. These technologies further position Ubuntu
Server
as the best OS for scale-out computing.

What happens if you add Debian stable to repos?

Message-ID: <CA+UbuEECp0TQ6RG4j7-fYqRtjWHbkLyxSZWvTrCwLuUpeEyOnA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I'd like to announce two upcoming events by HasGeek in Bangalore:
Rootconf in May, and The Fifth Elephant in July.

Rootconf [1] is a devops/sysadmin conference happening on 26th May,
2012, at DVK in the Christ University Campus. Some of the areas that
we want to focus on at Rootconf are Cloud and Virtualization,
Configuration Management, Performance Tuning and Security. We want to
hear about specific learnings that people have from dealing with any
of these challenges. Feel free to propose lectures, demos and
tutorials, for beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels of
experience on the proposal funnel [2]. The Early Geek tickets [3] for
Rootconf are open till Monday, April 30, 2012, and are priced at Rs.
700.

The Fifth Elephant [4] is a larger event on big data, on 27-28 July.
We're looking at how people store data, including experiences with
NoSQL databases, how data is analyzed per the requirements of various
sectors, and how the results are visualized. A fourth track brings
together non-tech professionals to discuss the opportunities and
problems working with data in their respective sectors. As a two day
event, The Fifth Elephant will have plenty of time to go into depth
with each of these issues.

The Fifth Elephant has an open submission process via the funnel [5].
A limited number of Super Early Geek tickets are available until
Monday, April 30, 2012 [6].

Subject: [Ilugc] Simple VPN tutorial
Message-ID: <CALDskyzTXw_xR4yUEcwpMfogdFaRjMALkYhwL_yAu0Pk8EXuvQ@mail.gmail.com>

What is a VPN?

A VPN otherwise known as virtual private network creates a tunnel between two
 endpoints on the Internet.

A typical case would be between a company's branch office and head office.

I will explain more about this since there are plenty of things nobody
will tell you.

No article or literature will specify what all goes into this
seemingly easy technology.

I used to think it was easy since I am the spam guy. I solved how
e-mail security can be
assured to organizations which is a much bigger problem but then it
turned out that
 VPN was also a big problem.

It took me close to 4 years to get it right.

Anyway this article will only speak about the higher level
interactions and big picture.

The reality of today's Internet is that there are not as many public
IPv4 addresses as we prefer.

Hence all organizations go for a private address space in one of
rfc1918 IP address blocks.

Say 192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8 or 172.16.0.0/12 addresses.

None of these addresses are routable over the net since millions or
networks will be using
the same IP addresses.

What a VPN enables is to route them across the Internet by
encapsulating them inside like our
 tanjavur bommai.

So we have an outside IP header which contains the two public IP
endpoints and the inside
 IP has the private IP endpoints.

Thereby we can actually talk to your LAN machines and access all of
the applications, even obtain
 a DHCP address from the remote network using a VPN.

Now VPN is often thought of as having to do with encryption but that
is only an aside.

You can jolly well have VPNs without any crypto and key setup.

PPTP and L2TP VPNs are in that category I think.

Let us leave aside crypto for now.

The biggest issue is that of being able to talk to a remote LAN
without using a known IP address or a
 static IP address.

You can do that when you are a VPN client but you can also do that
when you are a VPN server by using
 dynamic DNS services.

The applications that are not network aware are NetBIOS file
sharing(Windows shares) and layer II protocols
 and various other things like tally applications, db apps and so on.
These work inside a LAN.

And moreover you don't want to purchase a separate license for each site.

If you have Internet setup a VPN and connect to the head office. That
is how all major companies function.

Now you also have another way to use a VPN. Let us say you are at an
airport or you are at home. You are a single
person accessing the office LAN. Either with your laptop or on a
public computer.

VPN enables that as well.

We will close this article with discussing the different kinds of VPN
technologies I know of:

1) OpenVPN
2) IPsec VPN
3) OpenSSH VPN
4) L2TP
5) PPTP (Windows free software)

And VPN can work in tunnel mode or transport mode, normally we are
only bothered about tunnels.

You might have to add MPLS VPN which is the most widely used one or could
be even a GRE with BGP as the routing protocol.

You can either select it directly from the right-click menu or you can
define a custom short cut key for that by hovering over that menu item
and pressing the desired short cut key. In order to change the default
menu accelerators you need to set the following option

$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface can-change-accels true

True. However, MPLS VPN normally requires your service provider to be in
sync and provide the service which you would end up paying for separately.
In many cases, the providers strip the customers MPLS tags and put their
own.

For smaller organisations that do not have access to such services, stuff
like OpenVPN and SSH tunnels work well. OpenVPN is particularly easy and
good to use as it is NAT friendly - a big issue in VPNs. Downside - you
need to forward UDP ports and have enough. This is normally not an issue as
large organisations have a subnet of public IPs.

After some more analysis I found out that this is a Wordpress related
vulnerability which allows attackers to inject their code into those
vulnerable wordpress sites.  Have a look at Snort's alert based on this
picture http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/24/selection005.jpg/

What for?

Why do you need?

Then someone will be able to help.

Is it for load balancing? 100% uptime?

Or scientific computing?

Or....is it  a college project?

I dunno about BOSS, but its very much possible to upgrade linux mint
from repos . Previously there were issues with linux mint debian
edition (LMDE) because of the fact that its a rolling distribution ,
but now they have come up with update packs[1] to solve the issue .

If you are curious to experiment  . You can keep proper[2]  lines in
/etc/apt/sources.list and do #apt-get update and #apt-get dist-upgrade

1. LMDE update packs http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=1781
2.  Proper - depending on the distro and sometimes ( with caution )
the parent distro name + release .

Pavithran
