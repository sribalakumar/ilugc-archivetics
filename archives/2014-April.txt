Thanks all for your help, Effing Package Manager seems a great tool to
explore, but now i can understand why it's best to do  the build in the
Native OS.

Addendum/Summary (of various discussions)

Do read :

http://tim.dreamwidth.org/1844711.html


The point is

0. LGBTQ people are humans and need equal rights and nothing less than
equal rights.
1. Discrimination against LGBTQ people is still severe (at all levels
of socio-economic activity) and more than 50% face it.
Do see the US and EU reports on LGBTQ discrimination and persecution.
2. Religious interference in Govt is a huge problem in the US. Apart
from wrecking the economy by not paying taxes, they have kept the
education system backward and the people intolerant and bigoted.
Progress on marriage equality in the US is not good enough.
3. Brendan Eich's religious interests are detrimental to the world at large.
4. If you dare to ignore all of the above, then the Mozilla project
will suffer horribly.
5. We certainly do not want fascists and bigots in positions of power.

Other Links:

Brendan Eich made Mozilla's name appear on the donor list.
https://brendaneich.com/2012/04/community-and-diversity/

and board members are required to stand by company's stated policies.


This is also in direct conflict with Mozilla's policy which supports lgbt
rights and marriage equality:
https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2014/03/29/on-mozillas-support-for-marriage-equality/


btw if you think LGBTQ people form a minority then note this that
"percentage of LGB people in urban UK is ~60%".

Subject: [Ilugc] NFS with AD domain controller (Samba4) please share your
	gotchas.
Message-ID: <CAHhM8gDZXkdRQWdCum2V+SvrSPmjZ7VjbrJK2x3aFbdQHqsAfg@mail.gmail.com>

<background>

Current setup is a mix of Linux desktops (40), Windows 7 Ultimate
desktops (10) and OS X desktops (4).

openLDAP is the work horse doing the uid/gid mappings for *nix and OS
X workstation.   For the handful of Windows workstations, I have
configured Samba3 as NT4 domain controller with openLDAP as the
backend for authentication. With two registry mods in Win7, the
machines are able to join the domain.  Users are able to authenticate
against domain controller with roaming profiles.   After initial
hiccups, the first couple of weeks, this has been working well.

Occassionally, a few Windows app like Maya crash, when users login
with domain credentials but the same app works fine when the users
login with local credentials (defined on each Win7 desktop).

After searching, I have deduced the problem to  be with the roaming
profiles.  Randomly it gets corrupted and app like Maya crash.

</background>

The client CTO claims that at his previous company, Windows 7 desktop
with Maya worked flawlessly with the MS - AD DC (MS Windows server)
and is anxious to get AD (Samba4).   However, for the *nix side he
wants to maintain NFS file share.   I have done some reading on this
subject and realize that this will only work with NFSv4 Kerberized.
Search on the subject also shows, people who have tried this have
encountered issues in getting Kerberized NFSv4 on file server/client
to work with AD.

I would appreciate guidance and gotchas from anyone here who has done
Kerberized NFSv4 with Samba 4 AD Auth.  (Samba 4 platform is Ubuntu
12.04.3 amd64).

TIA.

This most often happens when two machines do domain-logon with the same
'userid' at the same time. The roaming profile is simply copied around
during login and logout. This can easily race when the same profile is
accessed from two machines.

Your use case scenario makes sense.   To the best of my knowledge, the
user is using only one Win7 desktop.   I will double check with the
client.

Hello everyone,

I am now trying to learn Python BeautifulSoup framework. I want to get all
the mobile name with price in flipkart.com. I have got the following code
on internet. But this code get only current page details... I have to get
all the phone details in my document... What is the way to do this possible?

Here is my code...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check whether setting the windows registry key DeleteRoamingCache to 1
helps you in anyway. This is used for forcing windows not to cache user
profile locally, i hope.

Indeed, client confirms the domain user has simultaneous login into
multiple workstations.  I will ask to stop this practice and see if
the problem goes away.

Development board in the sense ? I tried to follow the steps which were
given here .

http://ecos.sourceware.org/getstart.html

1.yum install compat-libstdc++-33

2. Next to know my system architecture used
less /proc/cpuinfo  and then installed the tool chain for my architecture
which was Intel X86

3.wget --passive-ftp ftp://ecos.sourceware.org/pub/ecos/ecos-install.tcl

4.sh ecos-install.tcl

5.Next I tried to invoke the ecos configuration tool .
As mentioned in the ecos 3.0 user guide , which was got from
http://ecos.sourceware.org/docs-3.0/
/*
Add the eCos Configuration Tool install directory to your PATH, for example:
export PATH=/opt/ecos/ecos<version>/bin:$PATH
*/

Till here it worked for me .

The next step was mentioned as

/*You may run configtool with zero, one or two arguments. You can specify
the eCos repository location, and/or
an eCos save file (extension .ecc) on the command line. The ordering of
these two arguments is not significant.
For example:
configtool /opt/ecos/ecos<version>/packages myfile.ecc
*/

Here I got stuck .

Unless this is something specific to GNU/Linux, you might not get
answers. You might be better off asking this question in the
manufacturer's support forums.

It would help readers of your email if you could provide:

+ vendor-make-model of the SAN; firmware version
+ OS being used in your architecture

as a starting point.

The other option is to check the documentation for your SAN hardware
manufacturer for the specific Error Code/Error Message and proceed
from there.

Either way, without a description of the system that throws the error,
it would be guess-work.

Hope you have used the GNU Toolchain customized for ecos (i386-elf)
which is available from the below link, and not the one which comes
with your GNU/Linux distribution.

ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/sourceware/ecos/gnutools/i386linux/ecoscentric-gnutools-i386-elf-20081107-sw.i386linux.tar.bz2

You should also set the following variable, something like

ECOS_REPOSITORY=/opt/ecos/ecos-3.0/packages/

for ecosconfig tool to work.

For running your eCos application, you may try using QEmu using 'PC
Motherboard' target.

http://www.panix.com/~grante/eCos-on-QEMU.html

Recently I conducted several workshops on 'eCos Realtime Operating
System' for M.E (CSE) students and used the following distro/tools in
the practical session.

Distribution: Fedora-20 (i386)
Additional RPM packages to be installed: qemu, tunctl, tcl,
genisoimage, xterm, compat-libstdc++-33 and some font packages (as
xterm didn't work properly due to some missing fonts)

Not the direct answer.

But related.

Portia is a tool for visually scraping web sites without any
programming knowledge. Just annotate web pages with a point and click
editor to indicate what data you want to extract, and portia will
learn how to scrape similar pages from the site. Portia has a web
based UI served by a Twisted server, so you can install it on almost
any modern platform.

Message-ID: <CAOsBiW_ksHVjbPy631ckSE6LV0P4c+qeHTHJrDd6jaiJ3vj1FQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

The AuShadha project in association with Kanini is proud to announce the
opportunity for you to take part in AuShadha's development.

AuSdhadha is an up-coming Open Source Electronic Medical Records and
Hospital Management System. Unlike the other EMR/HMS software, AuShadha has
almost solely been developed by doctors for doctors. This makes AuShadha
much better suited for real-world use by doctors since it has been tailored
for them specifically. AuShadha has also been developed with a keen sense
of the best possible front-end usability and it shows when you use the
software.

Currently. the doctors have mostly finished all the needed medical modules.
They need some help with the non-medical modules like Billing, In-Patient
management, Pharmacy, etc,. This call for developers is mainly focused on
those unfinished modules. Developers can directly get involved in creating
or extending the pluggable Python / Django modules for the AuShadha
project. (GNU-GPL Version 3 Licensed). Development mentoring will be
available under the AuShadha project  lead and core developer Dr. Easwar or
front end UI lead Dr. Richard and Mr. Kumaran.

An understanding of the Open Source Developmont model and team work along
with knowledge of Python, Django, Git and version control would be really
useful.

I am a novice Python / Django developer. Can you suggest any good
reading as I join ?

Thank you for your reply...

But I have to use only Beautifulsoup for improving programming skill...

Here I attached my simple python code which retrieves all mobiles and price
and the link in flipkart.com


*import MySQLdb*

*import urllib2*
*from bs4 import BeautifulSoup*
*import itertools*

*db=MySQLdb.connect("localhost","root","","rate")*
*cursor = db.cursor()*


*for i in range(1, 2317):*
*    url = "http://www.flipkart.com/mobiles/pr?sid=tyy,4io&start=
<http://www.flipkart.com/mobiles/pr?sid=tyy,4io&start=>"+str(i)+"&otracker=nmenu_sub_electronics_0_All%20Brands"*
*    page = urllib2.urlopen(url)*
*    soup = BeautifulSoup(page)*
*    links = soup.find("a", {"class":"fk-display-block"})*
*    prices = soup.find("span", {"class":"fk-font-17 fk-bold"})*


*    name = (links.text).lstrip()*
*    price = prices.text*
*    address = "flipkart.com <http://flipkart.com>"+links.get('href')*

*    print ('\n\nPhone No = '),i*
*    print (name + '\n' + price + '\n' + address)*
*    sql = "INSERT INTO flipkart (M_NAME, M_PRICE, ADDRESS) VALUES('%s',
'%s', '%s')"%(name, price, address)*
*    try:*
*        cursor.execute(sql)*
*        db.commit()*
*    except:*
*        db.rollback()*
*db.close()*



This code gets all the details successfully but not quickly...
Is there any way to made this quick???

Thanks in advance...

Hi JD, My experience with Kernel + PPC bit out-dated. It is very difficult
blindly debug the kernel code. I use ksymoops script, which parse the panic
text and map the address to symbol, to narrow down my focus/debug area. HTH

Guys, while Windows XP is in news, we should leverage this opportunity
to express / share in all news / tech  / social media sites on
advantages of switching to Linux from an end-user perspective....

Please take few minutes of your time to share your views...

______________________________________________________

My comment on Mint (awaiting moderation)

I think switching to Linux Mint is a fair suggestion. I switched from
Windows a few months ago and am fine with the change. My essential
needs are browsing (firefox / chrome), music(banshee / rhytmbox) ,
movies (vlc) and rudimentary docs / spreadsheet work (libreoffice) and
all of which are handled well. Only issue is that your hardware should
work, which does more often than not. Use a Live USB or DVD, try it
our for a while before installation. Linux Mint is a good distro and
both MATE and Cinnamon flavors are good choices. If your system is bit
old, MATE is recommended option on older hardware.

I am NOT a developer, a pure desktop user and have got accustomed in
Linux desktop in few weeks. I also have Windows installed in same
machine as dual-boot for any contingency.

As part of  NRCFOSS (nrcfoss.org.in) -- promoted and supported by Govt of
India -- activities, CDAC has come up with BOSS, derived from Debian, which
has been installed and supported in various centres at Indian Navy, CHiPS
of Chhattisgarh, school laptops in Punjab/Haryana, etc. Working with ELCOT,
a version suited for TN govt operations has been created and training has
been given to employees at various departments. Apart from the technical
aspect, the trainers have also strived to generate FOSS awareness (and
removal of many misapprehensions) among the trainees who are mostly
non-technical staff using computer for day-to-day operations. The official
notification should ease the way for more FOSS adoption.

who had put in sincere efforts to bring Linux into the system. Afterwards,
there were 2-3 MDs -- the move towards FOSS was not as highly visible, but
steady. ELCOT/NIC have introduced Linux servers, desktop Linux (NIC
develops many eGov applns in Ubuntu ; CDAC team has installed BOSS in the
Secretariat departments and trained the personnel).

Of course, most of the legacy applns have been Windows based and many
others too.
Hope, the slow and steady introduction of FOSS/Linux will gain more
momentum.

Thanks baskar, that was a thoughtful help.You are welcome to do so.
Request to all floss companies, if you have t-shirts which promotes FOSS
and if you can donate the same as the prize to winners, it will be a great
help.

Not only from Python, but in any language you would use SQL statements to
achieve this.
Take a look at:

There is no concept of "evaluation" version in free and open source
software (F/OSS) because the entire software source code is available
to you under a license that allows you to download, modify, and
distribute the same.

http://omeka.org/
______________________
Omeka is a leading open source collections-based web publishing
platform for cultural heritage institutions, researchers, scholars,
and students, developed by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and
New Media (RRCHNM) and the growing open source developer community it
supports. It is released under the GPLv 3.0 license.

<snip>

Omeka is grounded in the flexible Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
schema, which has been attractive to the library and digital heritage
community, and the development team took steps to ensure that no data
becomes siloed in any Omeka site. RRCHNM designed the platform from
its earliest stages to be interoperable with other content management
systems, and item data is shareable through a variety of output
formats, including RSS, Atom, J-SON, and other XML feeds. With a few
key plugins installed, users may make their data recognized by Zotero
or import a Zotero library into an Omeka website. Using the Open
Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) the
Center developed plugins that allow users to share and harvest data
sets. Moreover, the current version of Omeka (2.0) provides a built-in
API that opens up a world of possibilities for collection use and
reuse for cultural heritage institutions with more skilled technical
staff.

Cc: "ubuntu-quality at lists.ubuntu.com" <ubuntu-quality at lists.ubuntu.com>

Just a gentle reminder that the final images for trusty are being iterated
upon this week, readying for release on Thursday. If you have not yet done
so, please consider contributing a test result (positive or negative) to
the tracker in support of the QA and release teams who are tasked with
determining the final shipping image.

How to help? Here's a link to the final milestone and images:
http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/314/builds

Using the download links under a testcase, download the iso of ubuntu or
your favorite flavor. Execute a testcase or two using the image. It will
walk you through installing or upgrading your machine. Keep on the lookout
for any issues you might find, however small, and report them. If
everything works great, report that too. Positive results help make good
decisions about an image being ready.

Testing an image is simpler than you might think. Checkout the guide and
other links at the top of the tracker for help. Here's an example
walkthrough:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ISO/Walkthrough

If you get stuck, feel free to ping me or someone else on the QA team.
There's plenty of ways to contact us!

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Contact

Thanks for helping make ubuntu better! Here's to a wonderful trusty release.

We are planning to digitize a old private library which has around 100000
public domain books.

To preserve them, we are looking for good high end scanners.

I got the info about http://mini.atiz.com/

Is there any other good scanner for such huge work?

Please share your thoughts on this.

Thanks a lot.

Message-ID: <1397713336.55130.YahooMailNeo@web190706.mail.sg3.yahoo.com>

I came across www.chegg.com site and tried their trial flow on guided solutions for MATLAB. The sample one was good - and I am just anticipating if they provide all guided solutions for a specific MATLAB book the same way then I can just learn the product by just spending 75$ in an year. Further they also help to solve problems / assignments etc.

But I am not sure of its reputation nor found anyone who has used it. Anyone can provide any review of that site? Are there any other place where we can study and get guide online? 

Anyone offline can help me out with my assignments / problems in MATLAB like the solutions provided in www.chegg.com?

Prakash

Message-ID: <1397726348.60895.YahooMailNeo@web190705.mail.sg3.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

I am re-sending this mail to the group cause the earlier one is yet to be received in my box - maybe it is lost somewhere.

Actually in interest to learn MATLAB I found the study guide at www.chegg.com. Going thru the trial flow aid I found it very easy to pick up and understand. They have solved examples of books which I feel is good. The anual charge is 74 $. 

However since I am not sure of their ratings and reviews - any one please let me know if have faced any issues with this site? 

Also is there any other site / people who can help me in same way?

Regards,
Prakash

Message-ID: <CAND2797bK_f11gw7251_AmAxXjh1ULrvq=CDkBhGMPH+NEkuDg@mail.gmail.com>

I have a NAS box.

IP : 192.168.10.11
share name : acplzimbra


I am trying to mount this a centos box in same network.
centos can ping the nas box and access it via browser.

When mounting using mount command, getting following error.

#mount -t cifs  192.168.10.11:/acplzimbra /nas --verbose -o user=acplnasbox
Password:

mount.cifs kernel mount options: unc=//192.168.10.11
\,ip=192.168.10.11,ver=1,rw,user=acplnasbox,prefixpath=acplzimbra,pass=********
retrying with upper case share name

mount.cifs kernel mount options: unc=//192.168.10.11
\,ip=192.168.10.11,ver=1,rw,user=acplnasbox,prefixpath=ACPLZIMBRA,pass=********
mount error 6 = No such device or address
Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g.man mount.cifs)


How to solve this?

Thanks.

Dear All,

I am having a NAS device that needs LDAP authentication.
I am on a server and I could mount  the NAS export on it. However it
appears like I need to create users on NAS also and authenticate inorder to
use it.
Can I install LDAP on the server to be able to authenticate ? Can I make
the conguration of LDAP local to this server and NAS alone - so that I do
not disturb other AD/LDAP services in the network ?

Please suggest

Talk to the NAS vendor and make him/her join your existing AD/LDAP
setup.   IMO, you should have one and only one
Directory/Authentication server.

What is the motivation for using CIFS mount?   Most NAS boxes support
both NFS and CIFS.   In Linux, NFS is a better option.

Additionally, it might be worthwhile to have a central Directory
Server to map uid/gid between your storage and the client boxes.

For those interested in having their own private cloud.

>From wikipedia

ownCloud is a software system for what is commonly termed "file
hosting". As such, ownCloud is very similar to the widely-used
Dropbox, with the primary difference being that ownCloud is free and
open-source, and thereby allowing anyone to install and operate it
without charge on a private server, with no limits on storage space
(except for hard disk capacity) or the number of connected clients.

	sale
Message-ID: <CAFe1ooL-v3wQJ7YGLRse0WKt+Q4nyNi-dJF-u70kSXE7zpa5Vw@mail.gmail.com>

Guys,

I take the liberty to post this on a forum I have been around about one and
a half decade :)
Admins please feel free to delete this post if inappropriate.

Around the end of last year I was interested in studying the stock market
and the patterns it plays with really attracted me. While I was
experimenting, I wrote a few apps to download and analyse in a systematic
way the number patterns. Used TA-Lib's python bindings extensively.

Initially started to write a front end website to display results for
myself but I made it presentable to general public.

Now due to other commitments and financial realities I have no time to put
into this.
The site is here:
http://nsepedia.com

I do not want this to go waste. I want to give it away to someone who sees
value in it.

Technologies:

   1. Linux VPS running software modules and web server
   2. MySQL database for data
   3. Python for all programming (backend)
   4. Hand coded HTML5+CSS3 front end.


What the site has:

   - Python based apps to download, analyse and create reports.
   - MySQL database to store stock data and TA results
   - Front end to see the data
   - NSEPedia.com domain name
   - VPS server paid up for a year till Dec 2014.

What can be quickly added:

   - Blog
   - Mailing list
   - User management

Can help to:

   - Make Android front end
   - Make iOS front end



Potential business:

   - Services around data produced with NSE data
   - Can quickly make it work for BSE data too.'
   - Built in modules so that the entire site can be "resold" to other
   exchange contexts.


Please send commercial interests privately to me.
Any other queries including technical, please post here.

Regarding commercial angle, I am not expecting too much. Just to cover my
cost till now and probably a small premium if some is going to run this
site commercially.

I am open to any joint venture too if someone with a keen business interest
and stock market knowledge to partner.

I would love to open source this if some one funds it for me. I need to
fund my other projects and hobbies :) Programming and computing is my bread
and butter.

Regards,
Arun

I took it for a spin a long time back.   It was like any other distro.
 My default language is EN, I reverted back to Debian since the native
packages were a bit out of date.

It is based off Debian.

Dear Friends,

We met yesterday at aerospace lab.
There were 19 members participated in the meeting.
We started the session at 15:30 hrs.

I started the quiz pro gramme "Kaun Banega Foss Pathi".  We grouped the
class intro three teams and Team A won the contest with a tight race from
Team B. I fired about 50 question  which included 10 visual questions.
Baskar of Linuxpert systems was kind in giving  the prize of set of DVDs
which had Ubuntu Repository.  "*ON BEHALF OF ILUGC*" I thank Baskar for his
kind gesture for giving the winning prize.

Gowtham Ram and Ganesh presented the talk on  open source hardware.
Ganesh who is a intern at CISR IIT-M explained the various open source
hardware project.

The "C" talk not happened.

The meeting had more of new members.
The meeting ended around 17:40 and we moved to gurunath canteen where we
got socialized.

Overall it was a good fun filled experience.

regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Will be great if the code is open. What do you mean by 'someone funds
it for me'? How much do you expect if it is monetary?

Hello everyone,
I am using django framework,
In this framework I am not able to collect static files,
I was give

settings.py

STATICFILES_DIR = (
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static"),
)

STATIC_ROOT = 'C:/Documents and
Settings/praveen.s/Desktop/Django/django_test/static'

STATIC_URL = '/static/'

STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
    "django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder"
    )


This collects files into a admin folder, but my own css files are not
collected... When I try to load my logo image I'll show page not found
(404) error. What should I do?

Thanks in advance...

Did you run the 'collectstatic' manage.py command? It picks up the
static files in folders listed in STATICFILES_DIR, 'static' folder in
each of the app directories and copies it to the STATIC_ROOT
directory, where you shouldn't be placing any file on your own. The
static files in STATIC_ROOT folder will be served only when the DEBUG
flag is set to True. For production deployment, the files will not be
automatically served by Django and you will have to configure your
webserver to serve those files using one of the methods described in
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/deployment/

You might have problems if the directory specified in STATICFILES_DIR
and STATIC_ROOT are the same

Are the files you are trying to access, present under the STATIC_ROOT directory?

I downloaded the latest SystemRescueCD iso yesterday (sourceforge
hosts the iso files).    Although, there are ads on the download page,
I got the ISO file without any ad fan fare and/or being redirected to
something other product.

Based on what I understood about this, only the project owners who
opted into the program will have their software downloaded as adware
installers. So I am not surprised this worked fine. :)

Correct. One such project is
Filezilla(http://trac.filezilla-project.org/ticket/8888). Also, it is
only for Windows users so we might not see it from other platforms.

Yes I did
python manage.py collectstatic command, It collects common javascript, css,
and images... But it'll not collect my custom css files... My files are
stored in current STATIC_ROOT directory...

Please follow the mailing list guidelines
(http://ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines) and avoid top-posting.
Interleaved trimmed posting style is the recommended one. Following
the mailing list guidelines will help you in getting answers to your
questions.

Django will look for static files in a list of predefined locations
and then in STATICFILES_DIR and then copy all of them to the
STATIC_ROOT. So you have to place your custom static files within one
of the folders specified in STATICFILES_DIRS and not place anything in
STATIC_ROOT directory and then run the 'collectstatic' command.

Please provide the answers to the other questions I had asked in my
previous email so that I can try to help you further.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Running a site with decent traffic (hopefully, and a good problem to have
:) ) in an unmanaged server (VPS) involves some amount of work hours every
week.
The cost will involve this, moving up to a better VPS if traffic increases,
Cost of marketing to drive up visitors, cleaning up and documenting the
entire code base (the back end downloader, analysis , front end etc) to
make it open source standard...

Please do message me off-list if you are interested. I honestly don't know
the cost of running this site yet with traffic.

Arun

Based upon my understanding of your Problem, My suggestion is as below:

 Suppose you have two rows of  data, the formula is as in N2

D1       M1       N1
D2        M2      N2 = if(month(D2)==month(D1),M2 + N1, 0)

Where D -- Date, M -- Meter Reading   N - Cumulative

In case you are expecting something different, please mail me off the list
with your exact requirements (with Sample Calc Sheet, ofcourse!!!)

Check if USB device is mounted somewhere using "mount"
$ mount
else, mount it manually.
You can find your device id (sdb - partition 1 here) with
$ dmesg | tail
$ mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
then you can access files in USB device from /mnt/ using ROX file
manager (if available) or from terminal itself.

The books are only in PDF format and copyrighted by TamilNadu Government,

It will be nice to release them in Creative Commons license or Public

With the source documents we can create epub.mobi and other formats

Do you know whom to contact for this and request processes?

<quote>

Dan Walsh had a great idea for explaining SELinux policy concepts in a
fun way ? creating an SELinux coloring book! He wrote up a script, I
illustrated it using my Wacom in Inkscape on Fedora, and we turned it
into an opensource.com article. Still. We needed physical coloring
books, and what better place to hand them out than at the Red Hat
Summit?

We got them printed up and shipped off to the Summit (some in assorted
volunteers? baggage ), and they?ve been so popular that Dan is getting
close to running out, except a reserve he?s kept for the SELinux for
Mere Mortals talk later today. We also handed out some slightly
imperfect misprints in the Westford Red Hat office, and we?ve been
told a co-worker?s daughter brought hers to pre-school and it was a
big hit ? the other kids want their own. When it comes to SELinux,
we?re starting ?em young on the setenforce 1 path.

How might you get your own copy? Well, we?ve made the coloring book,
including the text and artwork, available under a Creative Commons
Attribution ShareAlike license. So download, print, share, remix, and
enjoy!

I don't think so, talking to a single person will do this. It should be
raised in assembly and has to be accepted. Last TN assembly i think had a
word about free software, but nothing happened. You can also see the word
open source and open standards in political manifesto of major political
parties.

I dont think doing commons licensing is possible now. It needs a bill to be
passed[1].

Though a bill can help , it can also be done other way around with
bureaucratic help . Ncert has given its books under cc licence via
bureaucratic route and not the legislative route.

= April Monthly Meet

== Date & Time

26th April
3:00pm to 5:00pm

== Venue

Zilogic Systems,
Fourth Main Road,
Kamaraj Nagar,
Thiruvanmiyur,
Chennai

Location map: http://www.zilogic.com/contact.html

== Agenda

Talk: Mining Twitter with Python
Speaker: Dorai Thodla
Duration: 45 min

Twitter is increasingly becoming a great resource for a variety of
information. Python is rapidly raising as the preferred language for
data gathering and analysis. This talk will demonstrate how to use
Python to gather tweet and do simple analysis.

Talk: Hacking Python: Adding a new Python Statement
Speaker: Vijay Kumar
Duration: 45 min

Python is a very good beginner's language. The 'turtle' module
enables, Python to be taught to school students. But there is one
difficulty in using Python as a beginner's language -- the higher
barrier to writing simple loops. 'while' loops require the
knowledge of variables, 'for' loops require the knowledge of lists!

LOGO has a loop statement called 'repeat <n>', that simplifies loops
to a great extent. This talk will show how to hack Python to add a
'repeat' statement to Python, like the one shown below. This talk
is based on the Stack Overflow response http://stackoverflow.com/a/215697

-----
# Draw Square
repeat 4:
    turtle.fd(100)
    turtle.rt(90)
-----

If you would like to give a lightning talk, just come prepared, we
will be able to accommodate you.

If you are new to Python, the tutorial at
http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/ will give you a quick
overview of what Python is all about.

Regards,
Vijay

Possible reasons:

1.
Server is not reachable via network.
Try ping the server.

2.
openssh server is not running in server.
install and start it

3.
ssh running in different port other than 22
check the port ssh is running.

4.
Firewall is blocking port 22
check the firewall rules.

Hi Srini,

Possible reasons:

1.
Server is not reachable via network.
Try ping the server.

*unable to ping (request time out)*

2.
openssh server is not running in server.
install and start it


3.
ssh running in different port other than 22
check the port ssh is running.

*no,it is running in port 22 only*

4.
Firewall is blocking port 22
check the firewall rules.

*no firewall is not blocking. iptables is not running..there is no firewall
block.suddenly from today it happens,till yesterday able to logon to that
server.*


Some problem in physical connectivity i think.

Thanks,
HariPrasadh

Aren't the publicly funded textbooks by default in public domain? How can a
government say copyrighted? I am confused.

Quoting from  https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/
"To copyleft a program, we first state that it is copyrighted; then we add
distribution terms, which are a legal instrument that gives everyone the
rights to use, modify, and redistribute.... "

While genuine FOSS and Open Access groups tend to keep the spirit and
letter of 'openness", the babudom in government and even academia are
caught between their real/avowed objectives of serving the society and
yearning for control.

 Fearing the potential abuse of freedom, the tendency is often to clamp
down the usage of materials and facilities or put them in the mire of
procedures & formalities. Thus, the first step of 'copy right' is taken,
but the next step of distribution attribution is left incomplete.

Subject: [Ilugc] netflow traffic monitoring
Message-ID: <CALDskyxw2E3XA-pPVCg2TAq-nA12Z0jb4x-79ZWwfuur6oM6eQ@mail.gmail.com>

Long ago I had mailed about netflow.

I am still not done learning it.

But I will cover the basics which I know.

Netflow is a traffic monitoring technology useful for figuring out how
your local network is being used.

It is a Cisco standard, it is free and v9 is the latest release.

There is also an IPFIX standard but netflow is free, and plenty of
open source tools
 like nProbe, ntop and fProbe are available.

I believe MRTG does not use it though.

Basically it works using the premise that you need a sensor or probe to
 collect the flows, sense the traffic.

Then you need a collector to receive these flows collected by the probe/sensor
 using UDP either on same machine or different machine.

The collector then writes the flow records into the hard disk.

You can then interpret these binary files and draw a graph or simply
inspect using the text output.

I basically use 3 tools in OpenBSD to do this.

$ softflowd probe/sensor
flowd to collect flows and write to disk
flowd-reader to dump the binary flows into text output

It gives you all the TCP, UDP and ICMP , even raw IP flows telling you
the source and destination IP,port etc.

But it does not give you packet decodes like tcpdump.

Sorry guys. Please ignore my last message.

    I'm Naman (IRC:- hacknaman). We never actually got time to
congratulate and introduce each other well enough for gsoc 2014. Thus
to fill this vacuum there will be short IRC party scheduled on April
26th 2014 ( Saturday ) at 9:00 pm IST @ ##gsoc-india. All current,
past and future gsocer are invited.
     Following are the list of things that I think we should discuss.
should you have anything else to the list, feel free to do so.

  * Intro (of cource)
  * which option is better, INR or USD (I'm sure most of you want this
answered )
  * share past exp/tips with new gsocers so that they don't repeat same
mistake
  * discuss about gsoc meetup. (it didn't happen last year in the
northern area. would be nice to have one this time preferably at
Google's office )

be sure to drop by for some IRC snacks ;)

+1 if you are interested.

Regards,
Naman Gupta

A legal notice (consumer complaint) can definitely be served against such
institutes seeking refund and compensation.

== Talk 1 on Mining Twitter with python by Dorai Thodla

Dorai Thodla gave a nice presentation on Mining Twitter.  He explained
about the use  of Twitter nowadays.  He explained  the twitter as real
time news provider with various  examples.  Then he showed Twitter app
written in python,  through which he explained how  he bookmarks links
posted on Twitter.

Dorai showed  a code for  reading twitter feeds  and saving that  in a
database. Using  sql database command  he converted those tables in to
text document.


== Talk 2 on Hacking python: Adding New python statement by Vijay.


Vijay  gave a  session  on  `turtle` a  game  programing language  for
teaching  programing  in school  level.He  also  told  that he  learned
programing  using logo.   He believes  that teaching  programing using
turtle  will actually  create  interest among  students in  programing
irrespective of the programing language.

In logo for  iterative statement they use `repeat`.   But in python we
don't  have  repeat  for  iteration.  we have  `for`  or  `while`  for
looping. Vijay wants to solve this problem by hacking python.

He  showed  three  ways  to  use  repeat  in  python  script  so  that
interpreter wont through error.

=== 1st way

He used a shell script to change the repeat function in to for loop and
give a new file output.py in which

input.py                           output.py
------                                  ----------
repeat 4:    --------->      for i in range(4):
  fd(2)      convert.sh              fd(2)
------                                   -----------

=== 2nd way

The draw  back of above code  is the repeat statement  have any space,
conversion wont work.

So  he  come up  with  new  idea where  he  used  python  script as  a
conversion script.  He used token  module to replace the `repeat` with
`for` tokens in order to solve if repeat statement varies with space.

=== 3rd way

Now  vijay dont want  a conversion  script to  do the  job, he  want a
python script  in which  repeat statement is  used should  be combined
directly by python.

He  used  encoding technique  to  solve  the  problem.  He  wrote  own
encoding  `pyturtle.py`  to  convert  tokens  in  to  statements.   To
initialise that, he copied the file to python site packages folder.


== Conclusion

This month python meet end up with a good note and with two good talk.
We will see next meet with few more talks.

Regards
Rengaraj

Hi,

I will add with one point, Our contribution in putting LDD kind of activity
is missing for a very  long time.
IMHO, investing and thinking about  propagating our vision statement  which
is one of our mission needs  immediate attention. The tour what is been
proposed is a good idea provided if we go and meet people in the (remote)
rural area, empower them with free software tools(may  be meeting self help
groups and training them).

I second this idea. A day spent in a village will be useful to the
society as well as refreshing to us.

great initiative.

Good idea - but how do we identify the right deserving village - one which
is forward looking and welcoming of technologies. What we give should also
reach.

Hi Kavin,

My advice is not to learn from training center. Do self learning. If you
need I can cover up basic thing about SEO to help further.
seobook.com / moz.org : This are the websites will help you to learn.

Self learning along with experts guidance will achieve more.




With Thanks and Regards,
Kumar

It seems they are not shipping text2image.cpp in their tarball, we have
to checkout their svn tree and compile from there (or we just need to
get text2image.cpp and add it into Makefile.am, someone who is familier
with autotools can do it easily)

Its a bug, and we should inform the maintainer that text2image.cpp is
not in tesseract-ocr-3.02.02.tar.gz.

try,

$ make training
$ make training-install

from svn checked-out directory. It seems they didn't add 'training'
directory into 'SUBDIRS' in top Makefile.am, Also, I can see they are
asking the user to specifically run 'make training' and 'make
training-install' to compile the training tools (Instructions can be
seen at the end of ./configure output)

Dear Friends,

Just spoke to Mr.Saravanan of  http://saweetrust.org/ .
Mr.Saravanan said that he  can help in organizing workshop in villupuram
district.
I asked Mr.Saravanan to know the possibility  for conducting programme near
"Kalvarayan Hills" where the tribal people will be  more.I said this one
day of programme may induce awareness among people especially the young
ones.
Mr.Saravanan said that they have a rehabilitation center in the foot hills
of kalvarayan hills.
Now we need support from saweetrust.org to make this workshop happens,
ofcourse the physical volunteers of ilugc to support this initiative.

Side note: Kalvaryan hills is good for trekking, beautiful greenary hills
worth seeing one. approximately 250 kms off chennai.

Dear All,

It is a good move to utilize the community voluntary effort towards
bridging the digital divide. We welcome it.

We have few active budding activists there, it could be a great experience
for them to get involved in such external community activities. Lets decide
the plan and details collaboratively and make this a fruitful experience
for all.

Dear all,

Knowing your response we can plan like

a) initiating  the letter to saweetrust at gmail.com asking  for their support.
b) Plan the travel like no of days and the  activities there

I will give a rough plan like this
Start from chennai by  5 am, reach the spot by 12 pm , start the  workshop
by 1pm and run it till 5:30pm and start from kalvarayan hills by 6pm and
reach chennai by 12 am(mid night), We can plan the activity  any day before
the 16th May 2014, so that we can be at home on vote counting  day to avoid
unnecessary hiccups.

any alternative ideas are welcome, i request ilugc volunteers to give their
nod/response atleast by  2nd may 2014 11:00 am IST.
I request alagunambi to invite volunteers from FSFTN so that we can make a
good foss show.

How many students will be there?

Usually, for a classroom/lab training with 40-50 students,
2-3 people is enough.

Hope we can get these 2-3 volunteers for sure.
Raman already agreed.
Count me in.
Hope you also will be there?

How many more volunteers we need?
