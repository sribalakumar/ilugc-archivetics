This message is far from clear:
 1. What do you mean by "Debian Lenny early unstable release"?
    Debian lenny and Debian unstable are different releases.

 2. Did the installation run to completion? If not where did you
    get stuck?

 3. What do you mean by "try to upgrade"? Did you use 
 	aptitude safe-upgrade 
 	or
 	aptitude dist-upgrade

Usually, running "apt-get -f install" will try to fix most errors
using all the information that it can gather. You need to have a
good network connection and a proper Debian mirror listed in
/etc/apt/sources.list.

Kapil.

This would point to a serious problem with your package management
status.

I am surprised that this would happen with the steps you described:

 1. You installed a working Debian lenny from an old pre-rc dvd.
 2. You created a new /etc/apt/sources.list as enclosed in your mail.
 2. You then connected the working machine to the network and ran
     apt-get upgrade
    to upgrade it over the 'net.

... but it _can_ happen with really early dvd's :-(

One of the interesting sources of information will be:
	/var/log/dpkg.log*
You may want to look through it to figure out how/when things went
wrong.

Dear Kapil.. Thank you very much.

 I read it.. and I corrected the problem.. I ran apt-get autoremove followed
by apt-get dist-upgrade..


Thanx..

Subject: [Ilugc] Ubuntu8.10-Will it take 8.04 DVD as source?
Message-ID: <20081102190914.741cbe8f@localhost>

Hi All,
I have a slightly quirky question. I just now downloaded 8.10 CD image
and burnt it to a CD. I have the DVD of 8.04 which contains so many
additional applicaions not found in the default CD.

My question is this: If i install Ubuntu 8.10 with the CD and the
system is running. Now if i include the 8.04 DVD in the apt -
sources.list , will it take that as a valid source and install
applications from the DVD? I am going ahead with the idea that
I do not need the bleeding edge software of 8.10 and am quite happy
with the other multimedia and miscellaneous software from the earlier
distro.
Or will it conflict?
I assume GNU/Linux will have backward compatibility but I just want
confirmation from experts in this forum.

Regads

It's a pretty bad idea to do that as things might have changed a lot 
between 2 releases, especially the dependent libraries and sometimes 
kernel changes as well. It might work without problems rarely, or with 
some problem here and there though the software remains mostly usable, 
but nothing is guaranteed to work and more importantly, if anything 
breaks due to this you can't even rant about it anywhere or file a bug.

On another note, "Backward compatibility" means that the files or data 
you created or used with an earlier version continues to be valid and 
usable with the current or improved version. For example, it means your 
site is still viewable with the browser, you documents can still be 
opened and edited with the same office application, etc. It doesn't mean 
your bizare combination of newer software will work with the older 
libraries or vise versa.

for a particular software, if you want to do that, you can pin down the
version of the software in a file /etc/apt/preferences

by doing that, even if your repository is pointing to intrepid, any upgrade
won't result in upgrade of that particular software. it will remain the as
such.

This should be of help:

Dear Friend Pankaj,
?
?
I believe your problem of xserver in Fedora 9?not working but works with Redhat 9, Fedora 4?etc. is not due to RAM problem.
?
I have installed in my college Fedora 9 successfully in Intel dot station with 128 MB RAM.
?
Two years back I faced similar problems when i installed?Fedora 6 in old monitors -14inch. 
I solved it by editing the following file 
?
vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf
?
change the default?depth from 24? to 16 or you can make it 8 also.. Then do
?
startx
?
?
I believe this would solve your problem and you need not go for light weight?linux distribution.

Hi all,
 I am having a Pentium IV system with 128MB of RAM and Intex RTL 8139D Ethernet
Card. When I am installing some old linux 
distributions such as Red Hat 9, Fedora Core 4 then I am able to execute X
window but my ethernet card is not being detected. And 
when I am installing current linux distribution such as Fedora Core 9 then my
ethernet card is being detected but X window is not 
starting due to insufficient amount of RAM. So can you please suggest me a
lightweight linux distribution which can detect my 
Intex RTL 8139D ethernet card as well as I can work in X window. I will remain
thankful to you for this forever.

Am happy about that. But I would suggest you format your posts a bit. It is
good to ensure the following
                 1) Dont have too many ......
                 2) If a paragraph ends, leave a line blank after it.
                 3) Give a space between the full stop and the next word.
                 4) A space before and after the bracket will work wonders
in improving readability

Generally it is not a good idea to install packages from an earlier 
version.

What is it in 8.10 that you want real bad and is not available in 8.04?

Why not install 8.04 (from the DVD you have) when you have confessed 
that you do neet the bleeding edge packages of 8.10?  Since 8.04 is LTS 
(long term support) most likely newer version of packages may available 
for 8.04.

Find out the chip manufacturer using `lspci -v`. Then you have to get
the particular driver for the card and install it manually. To find
out the exact driver perhaps Google is the only way unless you know
it. Please read [1]. Though it is for CentOS, but I believe it'll be
similar for Redhat also.

Are you using broadcom nic. There have been compatibility issues with
broadcom and RHEL in earlier versions also.

No of the CUI and GUI mail clients are avail in Linux Env. Do search
in internet and try to find out which is suitable for you. Normally
some default mail client will be installed in your system, check that
also.

Plz do a little bit of home work before asking a Q in that list.

Your question though short does convey the message that you want to be
told what to do.

That is not the way mailing lists work.

Here people volunteer their time to help people in need who are
industrious.

You need to clearly show what you did and then people will certainly
come forward to help.

Since nobody here is paid any money if you ask for help without giving
anything in return that is bound to irritate people...

Thanks.

Hi !

You do not want to spend time putting down your problem clearly . And you
want explanation step by step .. Yes it is irritating.

See some earlier postings and see how people have come forward to help.

I wrote an article in LG this month which I also posted as a URL to
this list. If people want to have a practical demo, and we can get
one computer for every two / three people then I'll be happy to do a
"hands-on" demo.

It is about installing Debian (tho' I have a few ideas about Fedora
as well) "inside" a working machine (which could be Debian, other
distro or other O/S).

Hi !

It is too late now but I would like to sponsor free "hosted PC" at a future
date for Ilugc members so that they can play with Linux PC  from their
computers ( including windows computers). It will be very useful for
learning. It is available now also but the band width is limited. Later we
will move to a better server.

This is a part of open source virtualisation platform and VDI solutions
being developed here.

Hope you find it interesting !

Subject: [Ilugc] Reg:: Yelp Yelp !! with KDE 3.5 on Intrepid
Message-ID: <49113F96.8060200@naukri.com>

Hi All


All excited with the release of ubuntu 8.10 I installed it the next day 
it was released. And since then I have been
trying to install KDE3.5 on it. And I am going nowhere, I have googled 
and googled with nothing concrete.

Intrepid by default comes with KDE 4, although I love KDE, but KDE4 is 
absolutely unacceptable.

Please please someone help me !!!!

Thanks n Regards

Well, As others said, you can do some groundwork. But yeah, let me get to
the answer.
I see that you use gmail.
GMail's help system can be used and you can retrieve instructions for

1. Check 'dmesg' output to get more detail

2. Try to pass kernel parameter pci=noacpi

3. If nothing works, then you may need to recompile your kernel to
support USB mass storage devices.

Do you have NIC? if yes, how many and what is the interface name?

Are you connecting to Internet thru NIC or USB?

Are you using any virtualization tools, or have you configured bridged
network or aliasing.

"But internet is working !!!"

This kind of issue sometimes occurs in bridged environment wherein the
interface shows disconnected however you are still able to access the
network.

Ashish.

hi all,

in our college we have plans to organise workshops for students classified
on their year of study. i need suggestion like what kind of workshops can be
organised for 1st yrs. what for 2nd yrs.... also all of them would need a
initial workshop on introduction to foss. what can be the agenda for it.
your suggestions would be valuble resources for us to plan the workshops.the
duration of workshops will be one or two days. main aim of them would be to
give a slice of the FOSS philosophy.

Just invite the students irrespective of the department or year in
which they are studying.

1. Take whatever you need from:

2. Do an installation demo:
  * LiveCD demo.

  * Formatting, partitioning concepts discussion.

3. Give a desktop software demo:
  * Window managers/desktop environments.
  * Browser, chatting software.
  * Media players.
  * Different programming languages, with editors/IDEs.

hi

Sahana:
http://www.sahana.lk/
is the worlds best open source disaster management application. Sahana is 
looking for contributors. So why contribute to Sahana?

1. It is good and useful especially for countries like ours
2. It is one of the few good open source products coming out of Asia - Sri 
Lanka to be precise
3. It is coded in php which means that the large number of php developers in 
this list can have a chance to work with good programmers, improve their 
programming skills and contribute to a good cause also.

If interested head over to the Sahana site, install the software and start 
contributing.

Many school teachers were transforming their academic syllabus into
presentation and documents. They were showing more interest in
teaching students in a practical way. but i seems they were not
recognized. And the teachers network did not do so.

Can any one suggest them to get recognized and let them to publish
their documents and presentation in internet especially for tamil nadu
Goverment schools students.

can we get a few of them organized, collate their inputs and upload, e.g. on
a moodle set up?
NRCFOSS can possibly host the moodle in our helpline website (and host the
initial meeting too) -- at least I can initiate the discussions and try to
get things going.

if we show some specific results, we could approach other agencies to get
better support and spread.

There is one more good website for Presentation sharing

http://authorstream.com

This site seems to be better than slideshare as it allows different
conversions [from ppt to other formats] and also the 90% of the  custom
animations, applied on the uploaded document, is preserved. which doesn't
seem to happen in slide share.

Thanks,
Krishna.

Subject: [Ilugc] Unable to activate ethernet card in zenwalk linux
Message-ID: <53020.1226247244@glug4muz.org>

Hi all,
Today I have installed zenwalk on a Pentium IV system with 128 MB RAM and Intex RTL8139D ethernet card. Now in order to configure 
my ethernet card when I am using netconfig command then I am setting following values for the parameters asked:

Hostname: zenwalk
Domain: org
Network Type: Static IP Address
IP Address: 192.168.0.4
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: None
Nameserver: None

Then I am getting message that a network card using the 3c59x.o module has been detected. Then I am accepting the configuration. 
Thereafter I am getting the message "Setting Accepted: Basic network configuration is complete". But after then when I am 
executing the "ifconfig" command then I am not seeing the name of eth0 in the list of network devices. And I am also not able to 
ping my other systems in LAN. When I am executing the ping command then I am getting the message "Network is unreachable".

So please help me by telling how to activate the device eth0 in zenwalk linux when my network card has already been detected with 
the module 3c59x.o. I will remain thankful to all those of you for this forever.

Best Regards ...
Pankaj Kumar

so.

- where i hav to register the company first
- how can i sale the application (developed under linux) with out any legal
and licence aggrement issues
- what kind of documents i have to maintain such as accounts,etc

- wheather can i sale any such desktop application that i developed under
inux
- how shall i know the current market price of such application

First you might want to consider if you want to register it as a 
'company' in the first place. Normally, 1 or 2 member concerns, being a 
proprietorship will do. Being a 'company' has it's own set of 
formalities. If you're small, you're better off avoiding those. If I'm 
not wrong, the govt. has recently issued a notification for forming LLPs 
(limited liability partnerships). See if this works out better for you.

Any decent CA firm should be able to handle your accounts. You can try 
to do it yourself, but accountants save you a lot more time and hassle.

I suggest you do a lot more research on the web before you attempt this. 
Running a software company is not easy (starting is, otoh), if you're 
asking these kind of questions, it means you're not ready. Ask yourself 
as to why you want to do this. There are easier ways of making money ;-).

Looks interesting. I would not have imagined that the system call
overhead would be that much.

An interesting thing to try would be to integrate this with
capabilities to reduce the privilege of the kernel-mode process.
However, I am not sure if kernel-mode processes can work with reduced
capabilities. For example, how much can one reduce the capabilities
of a kernel module?

This would allow the process to have the benefits of reduced overhead
without (too many) security complications.

Regards,

Kapil.

Although kernel-mode user processes are ordinary user processes, they
have a few limitations. If a kernel-mode user process violates these
limitations, the system will be in an undefined state. In the
worst-case scenario, your system may be broken.

Sounds a lot like reading the DOS TSR programming docs! :-)


I'm not so convinced about the practicality of pushing user
mode code into the kernel.  You lose all security offered by
the kernel to get a modest performance gain.

Advancements like the sendfile system call offer similar
advantages while preserving the unix security model.
I guess this is the right way to go.

hi friends,

  i want to develop a mail box application, its functionality is like this

  we need allow users to create, login and manage their own mail accounts
 and to manage  mail accounts (inbox, address book, compose,sent mails ..etc
) based upon their user logins.
 The main functionality i want here is, when a user logs in and opens a mail
, it should have a status set as "locked " and released  after  90 mins ,
(and if any other user logs in to the same account in between the lockin
period, then this particular  mail should not be accessible to that user )

 is there any open source application or services .. so that we can use to
build this application.
 using database (mysql) & PHP and Linux server

Hi All,

At present we are taking our backups in DVDs on weekly basics.
Due to some abnormal events like fire accident,flood,Tsunami etc, our backups are still in RISKY.

So we are planning such that our data should be in any other place which is more security  and less cost.

Please suggest me a good and economical disaster management backup .




Thanks & Regards

If this is the going to be the reason, what I have seen big companies do is
to take backups in tape drives and send them to their branch at another
location on a day to day basis. Each should be separated at least by few
kilometers na?

Say Chennai will be the disaster recovery center for a Powai section and
Powai will be the dis-aster recovery for Hyderabad etc., The may be other
possible ways too..

Hi !

There are open source based solutions and you can back it up in the cloud
like Amazon s3. It may be cheaper depending upon your requirements.

If you do not want to do it yourself there are commercial bundles also with
proper SLA.
Here some links for amanda , vembu etc

first see if your modem is detected , once that is confirmed , run
wvdialconf , and then edit /etc/wvdial.conf and add the appropriate
username and the password and the phone number for your connection . 
After that you just need to run 'wvdial' at the command prompt , you
should be able to connect to the internet . 

hope this helps

Ubuntu Tamil Team had its Intrepid Release Event on Nov 09 at Erode. Erode
IT Association had made complete arrangements for the event. Sri Ramadoss
and Padmanathan took part and conducted the event.

It was a day long event with the participants introduced hands on to Ubuntu,
starting from Ubuntu Installation, Setting Tamil Features, Listening to
Songs, Playing Videos, Repository and package Management, GNU/ Linux File
Structure etc.,

Participants took part with great interest. We made use of Cutomised Tamil
Version of Ubuntu for the event which received great response from the
participants. Special Thanks to members of Erode IT Association - Raja,
Balu, Srinivasan, Manohar, Mutharasu for organising this event in such a
short span of time, immediately after we called for hosting such an event
outside Chennai, the Capital of TamilNadu.

Erode IT association has announced a Ubuntu Competition for participants to
keep the momemtum going! This has paved way for more events, the details of
which will be furnished soon

Document prepared for this event can be had from:
http://ubuntu-tam.org/avanam/nigazhchi/2008/nov/erode/

Heart felt thanks for Erode IT Association for Organising this event. More

One Day One Deb: http://debaday.debian.net/ (Thanks Raman P)

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

eject -- Eject the removable media

Summary:

Eject allows removable media (like CD-ROM, Floppy, Tape, JAZ, ZIP) to
be ejected under software control. The command can also control some
multi-disc CD-ROM changers, the auto-eject feature supported by some
devices, and close the disc tray of some CD-ROM drives.

Examples:

$ eject -- Eject the default device, mostly CD.

$ eject -v -- Same as above and show more info.

Subject: [Ilugc] Script is required to load the SVN dumps
Message-ID: <3da91a280811102056x2c7cb7e4ha41f55afa5f4f97a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We need a favour.

We are having our project source code repository in a linux box (RHEL4).
Subversion Server 1.4 and Apache 2.0.55 are running in that box. We are
doing incremental backup for all the repositories using our customized
script on daily basis. The size of the repository is about 30 gb. We need to
move all the data in a new linux box.

Is there any script to load the SVN dumps? If so, kindly inform.

My Dump names are look like the following.

1_44_test_full.dump.gz
44_45_test_incr.dump.gz
46_49_test_incr.dump.gz
50_72_test_incr.dump.gz
73_83_test_incr.dump.gz

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

Thanks for your immediate reply.

We have around more than 10000 subversion dumps for 20 projects. So, we are
looking for a script to load these svn dumps.

Thanks.

I was not too enthused with the KDE 4.x in Ubuntu 8.04 and openSUSE 
11.0.  However, first looks of Mandriva 2009.0 (DVD bundled with Linux 
For You Nov/08) with KDE 4.1.2 is quite impressive.

ubuntu 8.0.4 has KDE 4.0.x as an optional install ( which was not ready at
that moment) while KDE 4.1.x is pretty decent after KDE 4.1.1 :)

Friends.

This is project time for college students.
Many students start to sqeeze sourceforge and freshmeat.

How we are going to use the students to bring out some useful
applications for linux?

We should have the list of required applications, and mentors.
we should guide them to build new applications.

Shall we organize a workshop for college students to do FOSS projects?

The list of required applications resides at
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/ProjectIdeas

But, The page requires fresh blood.

please add your ideas to that.

Let us convert the real industry requirements into student projects.

Thanks.

Wow! 

Laziness is the greatest virtue of a programmer. ;)

I cannot say about kmail(It is GUI after all), but I can tell you how to
do it with mutt or nail.

Firstly I don't get your question. If you have a fail with mail IDs,
can't you simply copy paste it into the To field of kmail?

What is stopping you from doing that?

Instead if you are interested in processing in a loop you can trivially
do that with a shell or python script and a command line mail client
like mail, nail or mutt.

Usually the shell's delimiter is a space, tab or newline but you can
easily populate a list with a comma separator as well.

Let me know your question clearly and we will see what can be done.

Thanks.

I have already mentioned that I know how to do that. Actually I have a bunch 
of people that I have converted to linux - and I want to show them how to do 
this with kmail (or evolution or thunderbird or any gui client) so that they 
can avoid sending mails with a thousand addresses in them.

Just to clarify - you can use OO.o Writer MailMerge to compose the
messages for a list of addresses and push it to an SMTP server directly,
but it doesn't allow personalization.

You are right. I use this trick as well. I had forgotten.

Oh. I can only do that from shell.

I was trying it when I got interrupted. I shall get to it again.

I just finished it in perl. My python skills are very bad.

Here is a way to achieve it in perl.

1) I get disk error when tried to boot from the install CD (probably due to some error when the disk media is prepared at CDAC).
Note: Iam getting each version from CDAC Chennai. 

2) When I tried the Live CD, the boot process goes till the "squashfs" step & then hangs itself thereafter. 

To be honest I have not got a single chance to successfully use BOSS till now. Iam much worried how a layman can do it. 

One happy news is Iam already running Red Hat 9.0 in my above said laptop. 

Can anyone help me find what the actual problem is.

My pointers are:

1) hardware compatibility specific to my laptop.
2) whether BOSS is adequately tested at the factory before it comes to the hands of a layman consumer.

Thanks,
Selvakumar.

You took a wrong decision. Try to latest Ubuntu/Fedora/Deb

IMO, BOSS == (Waste of our Tax Money && No good for FOSS)

Hi !

We are looking to promote a Social networking site exclusively for
Open source education and certification for Open source.

And please also look at  http://selfproject.eu/

I am interested in this project and if you need additional resources
kindly let me know.

Is there an organization or body which need to be contacted ?

I have downloaded the ISO images and not had problems with BOSS 2.0 
LiveCD.  The LiveCD recognized all devices on my Toshiba laptop (Intel 
graphics, ethernet, wifi).  The Beryl 3D worked out of box.

AFAIK, that not all systems will work out of box with any Linux distro.  
Just today, one of my colleagues bought a spanking new Acer laptop.  
openSUSE 11.0 hiccups half way through the boot process but Fedora 9 
seems to work; not had a chance to test out the webcam though.

Unfortunately, in laptops the consumer does not have a choice in 
specifying the components compared to Desktops.

Interesting.  
BOSS is based off Debian.  Have you tried the latest Debian on your 
laptop?

Not sure what exactly you mean by above.  You should not know the 
hardware of your laptop.  You have not mentioned its brand/model.

Err, you will have refer this question to CDAC.

Most popular GNU/ Linux distros, gets bugs reported by the User Community :-)

BOSS is unique.. Is there a BTS for BOSS?

Message-ID: <47160.1226503881@lonetwin.net>

Hi,

Being involved with linux now for a long time, I have always researched the level of linux compatibility before buying any new hardware. I recently needed to buy a cheap wireless USB adapter (cheap because, i think i'd probably use it only a couple months before my laptop's bmc4310 wireless card is nicely supported -- ehe, that's an entirely different topic -- no, i have not got it to work with WAP-PSK on Fedora 10).

Well, this didn't turn out as easy as I expected. Sure, 90% USB wireless cards just work with linux, but what if I chose a random one and it turns out to be from that 10%, so, I began researching. Unfortunately, a lot of 'cheap' wireless cards, don't come with tech. specs, so you have no clue what chipset the card is based on. For example looking at http://tinyurl.com/6p8tc3 (ebay.com search URL), I didn't know what to buy. I would have to research each of those individually, eliminating by price. Anyways, long story short, I got frustrated with the fact that I have to do this 'research' every time I need some new hardware, so, I thought of setting this up:

http://tuxcompatible.com

Think of it as a 'linux centric online marketplace'.

It is a 'classifieds' type site where buyers looking for linux compatible hardware (/software/periperals/devices/services ..etc), can shorten or eliminate the research step and sellers who know the linux compatibility of their devices/software/services can submit listing from their shops or (ebay or other auction site) listings.

I would like to invite hardware vendors (or request you to invite those hardware vendors you know) who know the linux compatibility of devices they sell, to create their listings here.

To prospective buyers, I request, please let the vendors know that you learned about their product from tuxcompatible.com, so that they are encouraged to keep posting.

...and to anyone else, I welcome you to comment or suggest improvement. You may also choose to help me out -- http://tuxcompatible.com/drupal/node/2

Please read more at the site.

Thank you for your time,
regards,

restored - this is the first time it has happened to me! But as far as I can 
see the guy who did it is not a professional spammer - must see how to ban

Never mind. I do copy paste all the time. ;)

As long as we know what we are doing it is not wrong at all, in fact it
is most desirable.

We are simply following Newton's quote "I could see farther since I
stood on the shoulders of giants gone before me. " ;)

Nice. It helps me refresh my lost python skills. ;)

However this approach assumes that you operate in 'smart mode of SMTP
sending'.

Not a very nice thing to do. Hence the need to specify the SMTP server.
Whereas my approach relies on the machine being properly setup for mail
sending by acting as a full blown SMTP MTA.

I am also unable to find out where you are parsing the file to fish out
the individual addresses from a comma separated list.

I thought that was your main question.

Anyway let us move on.

Have a nice day!

Best,

I am just assuming a file with one email id per line. In reality of course, 
the file will be a csv file with the email id in some fixed place in the line 
and it will have to be extracted like so:

emailid = address.split(',')[3]

> I thought that was your main question.

no - my main question is how to do it with kmail so that n00bs can do it. But 
now that the itch has started, I think I will write a gui for this script, 
add some error checking, publish it and become famous.

Oh no!

I expected you would involve,

-----------------
from django.core.mail import send_mail

send_mail('Subject here', 'Here is the message.', 'from@example.com',
    ['to@example.com'], fail_silently=False)

Ha ha.

If your idea is to become famous ;), then writing a GUI to automate
cannot take you very far I think...

GUI is meant for user friendliness , not for power.

You have to twiddle with the HorizSync and VertRefresh parameters in
your xorg.conf or something similar.

Try giving conservative values and see if it works.

Give a broad range and try narrowing it to get good refresh rates or you
will end up hurting your eyes.

I like my monitor to refresh at more than 75Hz and I use green text
against dark backgrounds and protect my eyes. ;)

Best of luck!

Why 7.10 ? 8.10 has been around for a month and a half now!

It used to be said setting wrong values for the monitor sync rates is
a sure fire way to fry it up!! Is it not true?

Not any more. This was a relatively common issue with old monitors, 
especially the bad ones. Any recent one is less brain damaged.

I have never experienced this. Nowadays LCD monitors are catching on
like wild fire and the setup is far less painful.

You have an 'auto' button on the monitor which adjusts everything for
you automatically.

Moreover the extra upfront cost spent on the purchase is quickly made up
over time in power savings.

Hence the TCO of an LCD monitor is far lesser than a CRT.

That is the reason I sold off my bulky CRT monitors including Sony few
months ago.

The information clearly indicates that the Horizontal Frequency Hf is
out of operating range (I believe this is typically in kHz and I
assume you have a typo). Try setting a lower resolution 800x600 or
1024x768 and give a try. As indicated by others you might have to
tweak with the frequency params in xorg.conf.

I too get the same error.

The error came after booting with live CD.
There is nothing to do with xorg.conf file, when can not get into live CD.

any solution for this?

This is very good advice. Sorry I forgot about the mode lines.

You can try a lower resolution like the above suggested values.

The man page for xorg.conf will drive you mad as it is miles long.

I suggest you take a sample file and modify. The mode lines is easy.

It should be like this.

No, you can fix it with xorg.conf.

Try running 

X -configure

and then

X -config /root/xorg.conf.new

Tweak these values and copy into /etc/X11.

During the configuration of X you will be asked whether Frequencies
should be written to the configuration file. You should choose "No".
You should also check that "DDC" is enabled --- which it is by
default.

The point is that older monitors were unable to supply the supported
frequencies to the video card so the user had to supply them. More
recent video monitors and cards can "talk to each other through DDC"
and thus find a mutually acceptable mode.

Of course, if this procedure fails (which is bound to for some
non-compliant hardware) then you will have to muck around finding out
the relevant frequencies and entering them in the xorg.conf file.

Fedora 10 is coming out in 10 days. So it is worth the wait.
Downloading a recent fedora 9 respin from fedora unity will also be
good for the impatient

Subject: [Ilugc] Sahana call for participants/contributors.
Message-ID: <c43b4a170811141508i3f707fa0qc4e9b3ef6e98f3e4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I have planned a workout at FOSS.in for Sahana which I have put up on
the project wiki here,
http://wiki.sahana.lk/doku.php?id=dev:foss_in_2008_ideas
Request you guys to take a look and if the project interests you,
would be glad to have some contributors to the project.
I have contributed to the Messaging module for SMS features using
SMSTools v3 in my Summer of Code 2008.
So in case you have worked on SMS related interactive applications,
your input would be helpful.

And we are also looking for Language/Translation contributors for
various Indic languages.
Appropriate mailing list information can be found here:
http://wiki.sahana.lk/doku.php?id=dev:mailing_list_policy

Feel free to ping me in case you are willing to contribute to the project in
any way or participate in the workout if you are attending the event in
Bangalore.

Thanks & Regards,

Ajay Kumar

Subject: [Ilugc] The fabulous jQuery cycle plugin ;)
Message-ID: <20081115033956.GA17737@lakshmi.gayatri-hitech.com>

Hi,

Those of you who know me really well know really well that I am a very
big fan of the bicycle.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle

I really think it is the most efficient vehicle on the planet. wikipedia
says that much from a technical standpoint.

Whereas I say so from a practical viewpoint.

I find that a cycle can make anyone's life simple. It along with
other things improves your looks, your health, your ability to get where
you want fast in Chennai (within few kilometres radius) and so on.

At other times I use the public transport, our excellent buses and
trains.

Anyway now coming to the point, I am here to talk about the marvelous
cycle plugin by Mike Alsup. Check out

http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/more.html?v2.23

If you know javascript programming, then you can look at each of the
pages and view the source.

The effects I see in his code are given below.

        *) scrollUp
        *) scrollDown
        *) scrollLeft
        *) scrollRight
        *) scrollHoriz
        *) scrollVert
        *) slideX
        *) slideY
        *) shuffle
        *) turnUp
        *) turnDown
        *) turnLeft
        *) turnRight
        *) zoom
        *) fadezoom
        *) blindX
        *) blindY
        *) blindZ
        *) growX
        *) growY
        *) curtainX
        *) curtainY
        *) cover
        *) uncover
        *) toss
        *) wipe

Oops! Maddening, ain't it?

With the cycle plugin showing off your photos to your friends is no
longer a drab thing to do.

Moreover I always use the image preloading technology along with the
effects that I use to ensure that the images are fully loaded before
they show up. We know quite well that bandwidth sucks in India.

I recently created 4 simultaneous slideshows since I had to show a vast
array of images(462 in number) and I know very well how short our
attention spans are.

The photos are very pretty, they were taken in Europe but I had to work
really hard to ensure that they work properly in a web based slideshow.

I have attached my code. If you need anything more, please let me know.

Thanks. ;)

Happy cycling!

Subject: [Ilugc] i18n and l10n
Message-ID: <200811150929.31492.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

i18n - internationalization and l10n - localization are two sides of the same 
coin. Both are related to each other, yet different.

i18n means, for a software application, to prepare the application to be 
translated into any language. So to a large extent i18n focuses on making an 
application translatable - this is done by marking the strings to be 
translated and providing a .po file for translators. To a certain extent it 
also requires marking things like dates, currency and the like for 
translation.

l10n focuses on providing resources for *all* applications to be used in a 
particular country/region. This is very often neglected, and in India a lot 
work is needed to be done on this. For example for each state in India, we 
need a database of districts, towns, villages. The idea is click on Tamilnadu 
and all districts in Tamilnadu show up - click on a district and all 
towns/cities show up. Another one is a resource to show pincodes - click on 
chennai and 600 0xx turns up. Localities/suburbs of towns are also important. 
If this data, in suitable xml format is made available - under some 
opensource licenses, the work of programmers gets much easier. State flags, 
state bird, state animal, important holidays - public and religious. 
Religions, sects and subsects. For example Christians in england would have 
divisions like anglican, lutheran, roman catholic - but in India we have CSI, 
CNI, syrian, jacobite etc. Same for Hindus and Muslims.

All these resources for localization need to be set up - and translated too. 
No doubt it is not very challenging work, but it needs to be done - maybe as 
student projects?

$ od -b myfile -- Dump the content in octal bytes.

$ od -c myfile -- Dump the content in ASCII.

$ od -h myfile -- Dump the content in Short Hex.

$ od -w6 myfile -- Set output width to 6 Bytes. Default is 16.

$ od -j6 myfile -- Skip initial 6 Bytes.

$ od -N6 myfile -- Read only 6 Bytes.

$ od -Ad myfile -- Show Offset values in decimal.

$ od -Ax myfile -- Show Offset values in Hex.

$ od -An myfile -- Don't show the Offset.

Dear LUGs,
                    I createa an open office text document in Ubuntu 8.04
using tamil language. I used tamil unicode font 'lohit-ta.ttf'. I converted
the document from 'odt' extention to 'sxw' for RHEL4 machine which is having
open office 1.1. document is open and show the content in Open office 2.4.
In RHEL4, it is open and shows only english words which is used in the
document.
I copied 'lohit-ta.ttf' to /usr/share/fonts/openoffice/ , eventhogh it is
not working.
If i am using bamini, RCL-Bharathiyar and tam-ananthi, all are working. All
fonts are true type fonts.

what is the problem?
any other drivers is required?

Padhu,
Ooty.

It is called the "Menu Bar" in Add to Panel dialog you get when you

I think the tone of this article is a little wonky. As far as I know *all* 
foss software is internationalised at the outset nowadays. Most projects will 
not accept code that does not have i18n. The problem is not with the 
Americans, it is with us - we just dont have enough translators. Even wildly 
popular software like drupal lacks translations. And localisation efforts 
also lag behind - which is why I made this post. And it doesnt help when 
there are people running around denigrating this activity also.

Hi,


Boycott Novell Protesters Man-handled at National Conference on Free
Software 2008


http://playingwithsid.blogspot.com/2008/11/boycott-novell-protesters-man-handled.html



Here is blow by blow account of trouble that brewed up on the second
day of National Conference on Free Software 2008 in Cochin university.
The activists put up posters against the Novell Corp (the main sponsor
of this event) at the Free Software exhibition complex.

The organisers called up Kochi police and man handled the Anivar
Aravind a former student of the Cochin University and a well known
free software activist.

Cheers

I  have been saying NONO to Mono projects for ages now :P.

But I am kinda distressed by the entire Boycott Novell campaign. Of course
Novell is a work of Satan :P but, when you have such infighting in a free
software exhibition, it does not project a good image of The Free World.

I feel people who use and promote GNU/Linux must be more focussed on
development and improvement of the OS and its various apps than be
concerned about Microsoft. When we keep complaining about Microsoft's
stupidity (which need not be actually spoken about), we behave more like
kids
fighting over their favorite Power Ranger. I used to be a "Not that Windows
sh*t" kinda first year kid at college. But for over a year now, I dont nag
people
telling them that windows sucks. I give them an Ubuntu/Fedora Live CD/DVD
and let them choose for themselves. I find it has a better effect on them.
Previously, they thought I was merely trying to act "cool and different".
Now
they actually see my point.

I am not saying that we must stay shut when Microsoft says "Hey, That Linux
kernel uses  the scheduler hand coded by Paul Allen way back in his 5th
grade".
But I strongly feel that referring to the OS as Winblows or Windoze on
Microsh*t
etc is childish. We know we are at a different plane. Let us not stoop down
to
the level of Microsoft which believes in whining about everything. A classic
example
being this *http://tinyurl.com/2n6tc3*


I dont care how many computers have Windows on them. I dont care about how
Windows 7 is going to shape. All I care to worry about is whether GNU/Linux
works
for me and how I  can help improve it! I go any distance I can for people
who want
to actually see the alternative. But I dont waste my breath for those who
are
obstinate and say "I feel Microsoft is the best. Are all other Microsoft
users fools?"

Exactly , I agree with Gautham , in my early days when i started using
Linux, I used to sit and explain it to my fellow students how Linux was
better(around Fedora Core 3 ;-)) than Windows.( Though i never used
Windows in my life ). But now if someone asks me, i just tell them why
"Linux is the best". 
Lets work towards a better GNU/Linux ecosystem and leave the choice to
the 'user'.

I still wonder why people look upto windows for functionality use cases
when contributing to OSS projects ?? this one thing still puzzles me !!

some years ago I used to keep track of the top 10 downloads from sourcrforge - 
and used to find that nearly all of them were windows specific software! It 
is actually the windows users who are desperate for free software - linux 
users are not, because they already have it.

I wonder what boycott novell people have to say about Novell's contribution to 
gnome and to opensuse?

What on earth is fluendo? Never heard.

Cool. Just now google threw a flurry of results.

Please pardon my ignorance.

Why don't you simply install mplayer and get done with it?

So far mplayer has been able to play any media file I throw at it.

Anyway thanks for letting me know about this company. Apparently
gstreamer was developed by them. I have never tried them but that is a
big project - getting audio streaming to work.

I have had reasonably interesting results with darkice though to run a
radio station.

I think VLC is amongst the best vid players. it plays almost everything and
even sometimes repairs files and plays them.

very right , the best example ..... I have not seen any Liux user
longing for Windows Media Player, well tell me how many Windows Media
player users run VLC ??
correct me if i am wrong.

I had seen a similar discussion (on LWN, I think when the last major
release of Mono was announced) earlier where Miguel de Icaza was blamed
and condemned for his two-sided behaviour towards Microsoft and Open
Source Software. But one among the many who wrote comments rightly noted
that : 
"Compared to the massive contributions Icaza has made to OSS (GNOME) we
really are not eligible enough to comment on his ...... "
I think a similar argument goes in the case of the boycott Novell people
too, though i partially support their cause .

Century of the Self - Hurt Egoes or The cause of the movement - a call
for  truce till resolution
------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------
 

I was there.  We were preparing for the session 'Caste Discrimination in
Konwledge Communities ' along with IISc Venky.
Arky called and we rushed to the spot of the problem . I saw many folks
there including 
Sameer of Ilug,Kochi, MES teachers and students, Arun , FSF , Secreatry.

 
I did tell him that from slumdweller we can put up a protest poster if
what folks were saying was true and
 exrpressed my solidarity.
 
However in public I also told that things are not as simple as they
appear to newbies like us. 
 
And as Arky told me the previous day - be careful my dear newbie - as
everyone has their 'agenda' at the end of the day. 
 
There was a gentelman standing next to me with an IEEE T-shirt. Who was
also protesting the incident. 
 
I told him that a ideologically strong free software advocate would have
differences with IEEE. That doesnt mean I 
tear his t-shirt.  He told me "you dont know what contribution i was
doing to ieee and fs ' and the significant work
 we have done to bring ieee to free software'. 
 
Yes though he is working  with IEEE for free software ( as i did in blr)
I need to understand the free software cause
 and help it spread rather than doing a stupid thing like tearing his
t-shirt. 
 
I have to see and understand his contribution to free software .
 
This is the question - do i take a puritan stand based on what RMS
himself said - and say nothing doing with IEEE 
( though they are not MS) - or do i look at it as avenue for growth of
free software - especially when the field is
 still empty ( imho) 
 

i feel that there is a need for both these groups - the radical and the
mass based - both have their role.  
 

infact i also saw that many leaders ( apart from the organisers and
protesters) were inspired by the event - 
especially by the mobilisation - and in  fact saw the role of both the
radical and the mass leader - and were involved in
discussions with both these groups 
 
Why are we seeing thse controversies errupt in recent times. Is it
becuase the free software movement is growing. 
Is it because some are worried that its growing in the wrong direction. 
 
Another person  told me this during the day : in a company you have
profit as a motivator - in a social movement 
ego is a motivator - as human being have we found a solution to this
issue of 'ego' - i dont think so - but i do believe - 
that whenever folks put their egoes behind and put the cause in front -
amazing things happen - but i do not 
know if its so easy for myself to do the same .
 
i did also see and hear many people - who strongly believe - that many
things can be done in their individual spaces - 
without being drawn into all this trouble and all these things are not
avoidable ..
 
whomever i met i requested this - a couple of years back when i was
inspired into the movement - i didnt see this happening - 
a controversy and flame every month - something has changed - i am sure
fsf , india can resolve this ... 
 
until then lets have truce in the field - without cheap hijack falmes
and stunts and lumpen behaviour -  let the mass based and the radicals -

do their work in the field - without disruption and provaction - after
all i see that many of them are on the same thinking lines and 
within the same family - and claim - simillar affilliations. 
 
 
btw we did sell 4365 Rs worth of gimp paintings from the slum computer
center.  had my chance to meet people like 
redhat venky, gora mohanty , pramod sir , mes students and teachers,
ilug kochi sameer, bio-informatic students 
who had put up a stall. thanks community ..we are inspired once again.
 
in solidarity

After a good experience at the First National Conference at Hyderabad I had
been planning to attend the Second Conference at Kochi from the time of its
announcement a couple of months ago. Even my serious ill-health could not
keep me away from the conference as many will vouch. After two weeks of bad
health of which 5 days were spent on a hospital bed I woke up from the
hospital bed and came straight to Kochi.

The Conference was well organised and the 1000+ delegate participation from
all over the country was magnificent. It was a representation of the growing
peoples' mass movement which cannot be stopped or controlled by vested
interests or power centres. What is obvious is the conscious conversion of a
developers' movement to a peoples' movement. THE PEOPLE ARE TAKING CHARGE.
The resolutions brought out at the conference are important and I hope that
they will be released soon.
One of the most important talks was the one by Sri. Sitaram Yechury where
the issue of the crisis in global capitalism and its impact on people and
the role of the Free Software Movement in building the resistance was
presented in terms that even a 10th standard student could understand.

A couple of years ago when organising the GPLv3 conference I noticed that
only a small group of people took responsibility and organised the 'event'.
But now the dynamics has changed. Events are being replaced by processes.
The Karnataka team (I am not referring to FSUG-Bangalore because though I am
an integral part of it I know that it is not representative of Karnataka but
only a miniscule part of the Movement. A single community. FSUG B'lore is
just a mailing list.) comprising of ordinary people from the slums, computer
technical trainers from villages, academicians, IT employees, engineering
students and others participated in the conference. The conscious effort to
build a mass movement in Karnataka is bearing fruit and this was clear when
almost one and a half bus loads of activists from Karnataka reached Kochi.
Even the efforts to sideline genuine work and at various important
protests/programs could not/cannot dampen our spirits.

What struck me as odd was why FSF-India which claims to be THE free software
community was not a part of this important process.
While we will support causes which are just irrespective of individuals and
banners we will definitely not allow elements to disrupt the movement here
in Karnataka or anywhere in India and we will continue to work to build the
movement the best way we know -- as a mass movement.
Join us and you will be assimilated.
In solidarity with the Free Software Movement,

I think vlc is very common among Windows users. There are somewhat
political debates on what is better even in mplayer mailing lists.

I never use vlc...

If you are interested in applying for the job described below, please 
email your resume to caiqs.jobs@citi.com, with a subject line 
ILUGC-firstname-lastname.   If included, links to your FOSS work is a
superior gauge of technical and team ability. 
 



Earlier this year one of the world's largest financial organisations 
constituted a highly-focussed internal business group which seeks to 
exploit advanced technologies in computation, data and finance for 
the purpose of out-performing in the global securities marketplace.  
The group is envisioned to be small and closely-knit with 2 main 
centers of operation, New York and Chennai, along with operational 
footprint in Europe and Far East.

Following on its strong performance since inception, we are seeking 
smart people with very strong pragmatic computing skills and a solid 
engineering/science academic background to grow our Chennai center.

For computational requirements, candidates would have demonstrable 
experience on GNU/Linux, on which platform they would have written 
significant Python/Perl code with database interaction, or they 
would have coded multithreaded C/C++.

The selected candidates would be extremely hard-working and driven 
to excel.  They would be able to work well with other (including 
geographically remote) team members.  All hires will gain expertise 
in understanding and manipulating data.  They will also be ensuring 
the optimal and highly-performant operation of a multitude of 
interdependent streams of data manipulation and processing - activities 
that are deployed within the group's execution/data centers which 
are colocated at the world's major securities trading hubs.

All hires, regardless of background or focus will directly integrate 
and report into this global team.  Due to the group's points of 
trading presence in different time-zones, work at international hours 
will often be required.   Work will be challenging and individuals 
will be encouraged and mentored to grow in related subject areas that 
will have long-term benefit to the group.

Compensation will be superior, will recognize individual contributions 
and commitment, and will reflect the group's success.

Not asking for me. Its makes things easier when we conduct GNU/ Linux
demos that all that you do with proprietary fundas (mp3, avi, flash
etc.,) can be done easily by installing this package. Put the VCD it
plays for you. Put the audio cd it plays and extracts the contents.

Visit onlinesbi.com you have a Java enabled site. Flash no. But
beware, these are as dangerous as M$ :-)

This helped at Erode to convice participants Yes, we now have
confidence to sell & support PCs based on Ubuntu.

all in one step,

sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras

Just wanted that flexibility with Fedora too, so that Fedora can also
be taken to people with the same ease Ubuntu does.

And the kernel? Ignoring GNOME and openSUSE is still sort of possible. But how 
do we boycott the kernel contributions from developers on Novell's payroll?

+1

The following makes the above more readable :) It took me a couple of 
reads to understand the question you are asking.

I wonder what the "boycott novell people" have to say about Novell's
contribution to gnome and to opensuse?

Come on, I have used onlinesbi.com numerous times with my OpenBSD
firefox. Never gave me any trouble.

This morning I saw the new railway booking site http://irctc.co.in and
that worked pretty well too.

I mean that the railway site has had a massive improvement now. Hence I
call it new.

I am not feeling so alienated anymore. ;)

For youtube I have another solution as well...

I thought the free software movement was about contributing to free software - 
this sounds more like some leftist revolutionary stuff.

Hi !

Wonderful ! Beautifully expressed !

Also we have the freedom to express our opinions. Protests should be taken
in the stride and they should have been magnanimously allowed to express
their views.

Even MS has contributed indirectly by accelerating the hardware development
with Vista !
That does not mean ......

Hi !

Is there a regulation like that ?

We are a multilingual society. And this is ILUGC ( Chennai)
Tamil is perfectly acceptable.

No issues with multilingual society and the right to choose your 
language and yes I am aware that one can post either in Tamil or 
English in this list.  

IIRC, there was a general understanding that members would not change 
the language in the middle of the thread like it happened in this 
particular one.

It is not fun for non-Tamil speakers or readers (like Arun), or people
who sometimes have to access mail with terminals which don't show
UTF-8 (my fault, but can't help it now).

there was also an understanding that a brief english summary would accompany 
the Tamil response - unless such a response is only relevant to people who 
can read Tamil.

I face this problem all the time in North India - they automatically assume I 
know Hindi and keep talking Hindi. I used to protest, but now I have given 
up - I assume that if they are not interested in whether I understand them, 
what they are saying is not worth listening to. I can read Tamil, but not as 
fast as English, and with email, anything I cannot scan at a glance, I 
delete. No time for anything else. So I simply assume that this stuff is not 
important enough to read. Common courtesy dictates that one should make 
oneself understood - sure, post in Tamil or Hindi or Swahili for that matter, 
but have the courtesy to attach a summary in English. Otherwise it is just 
bad manners - and highly impolite.

Hello every one !

I hoped things will be taken in lighter spirit !

I posted an appreciation for Tamil comment because the metaphor was very
appropriate and conveyed the idea beautifully.
Instead of asking to post in the same language , it could have been a
request for a translation ... like above.

I apologize for top posting by mistake.And I had corrected in the next
posting. It was not intentional.

Since you said "can't help it now", I ask my question.

Q: Is there a terminal utility for X that fully supports Indic languages?

I always assumed that people who write mail in Indic languages use a
graphical mail client like Evo/"bird"/Kmail, but perhaps I am wrong.

Hi !

I use Ubuntu with SCIM (Smart Common Input Method package). SCIM supports
many Indian languages and with a patch from CDAC you can use it for Open
Office also. Of course you need to know the key mappings and there are
phonetic system also (when you type
 angrezee and it types ????????? ).

Please read his sentence again. He didn't ask to open sxw file in
gedit. Of course gedit won't read it since it is not a plain text.no.
He is asking if you can see tamil text in any application, gedit being
an example.

I was not sufficiently clear. The question was not about input
methods. Rather it was about terminals that can correctly _display_
Indic languages when displaying text files encoded as UTF8.

The second question/comment was about what people use to
read/write/access their mail when they use Indic languages.

Some of us still use console mail clients like Mutt,Pine,elm... Even
if you run thous clients in GUI consoles, it will show UTF-8 chars as 
junk.

@Kapil, I feel, apart from console, the clients also need some amount
of support to process the UTF-8 chars. Let me check it in Pine.

SCIM is supposed to work with OO.o out of the box in most distributions
(I haven't tested it with Ubuntu), is there a specific need that is met
by the patch ?

No regulation but after a long debate a year or so back this was
agreed upon. At the very least, mixing up languages can confuse the

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

setfont -- Load EGA/VGA console screen font.

Summary:

The setfont command reads a font file and loads it into the EGA/VGA
character generator and optionally outputs the previous font. It can
also load various mapping tables and output the previous versions. The
standard Linux font format is the PSF (PC Screen Format) font.

Examples:

$ setfont -- Load the default font.

$ setfont -v -- Load the default font with verbose output.

$ setfont iso01.14 -- Load the iso01 font (size=8x14).

/lib/kbd/consolefonts - Default Dir for console fonts.
/lib/kbd/unimaps      - Default Dir for Unicode maps.
/lib/kbd/consoletrans - Default Dir for screen mappings.

Read the ReadMe files available in the above locations to get more 
information about the font and maps.

TIP: Set your default console font in /etc/sysconfig/i18n file.

Read: man setfont

HTH :)

Maybe Tamil works, but devanagiri certainly does not work acceptably.
(Check the encosed file which was created using yudit.)

I spent a bit of time trying out the various terminal options and it
_is_ true that "konsole" comes the closest to acceptability.

Most "libvte"-based terminals display something but have glitches.

Well, we can name a directory in Tamil.

But Ctrl-Alt-F1 --> login to your home and give an ls

the directory named in Tamil will be shown junk.

this need to be fixed :-)

I think this can be fixed by using bogl-term as the framebuffer
terminal instead of the linux console terminal. This is how the
Debian installer works in text mode (I think!).

For this to you work you must use framebuffer for the console rather
than "standard" text mode.

I haven't actually checked that bogl-term displays my file correctly
since I don't run a framebuffer on the console and there does not
seem to be a framebuffer emulation within X. So unless I fire up
qemu just to check this ...

Among lightweight terminals, urxvt has UTF-8 support.
I use mrxvt though, which lacks UTF-8, but hey, I check my mail in Emacs anyway. :)

Hi !

I came across this article when I was trying to understand the question.

http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?coll=linux&db=HOWTO&fname=/usr/HOWTO/Indic-Fonts-HOWTO.html

and  in PDF,

http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/pdf/Indic-Fonts-HOWTO.pdf

I really did not get the feel for the problem since 98% of my work is
done through the browser , google docs , gmail , ec2 , and all web
based applications.

Cheers

The u/mrxvt terminals do not display Indic languages correctly.

The problem is that (say) the word 'inDiyaa' in hindi would be
displayed as 'inDyiaa'.

What unicode complete fontset do you use with emacs?

Hi !


yeah ! but even my back ups are in the cloud !

Just kidding !

Any way Google gears seems to be working ! And I believe with all the
money being poured in to cloud computing .. it is not a bad idea.I
have been using google docs for about 3 years now. Never lost a single
document. Every document I have have previous versions to revert to
.... I can share it ..

for my work it is more than enough .. Of course you guys must be
devlopers and you need a regular desk top to make this happen !

I believe in web 2.0 .. anyway ,  atleast  now it is convenient for me !

Hi !

Good point !

I use Google docs and the directory appears in Indian language fonts
since it is web based !
So I have no problem is saving docs in various languages with
directory and files names in the respective languages like Tamil and
Malayalam.
We share these documents and the even inside the documents we mix up
all languages freely (e-g) comments in English

Power of web 2.0 !

Expanding on my reading on this topic ... :)

The nice article[1] by Marcus Kuhn explains that we need applications
(specifically terminals) with "Level 2" support for unicode in order
to correctly display Indic languages.

[1]: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html

There are things like a "combining character" (like vowels in Indic
languages) which modify the unicode character that comes before
them to give a _different_ unicode character; the resulting unicode
character is what must actually be displayed.

Such combinations also happen with European languages for words like
Mo:bius which is also represented as M?bius. However, in Indic
languages such support is far more crticial.

Itrans is (AFAIK) a way of representing Indic scripts in
ASCII printable characters so that:

 - the conversion to unicode is unambigous
 - the resulting Roman text can be read with a modicum of training
 - the resulting Roman text for identical sounds and words in
   different languages is often the same
 - itrans is a commonly available input method for those who use
   ascii keyboards to enter Indic language text.

So if you care for those who read their mail in text consoles, then it
is probably better (IMHO) to use Itrans to represent your text until
applications with Level 2 support for unicode become commonplace.

Regards,

Kapil.

I don't have a complete fontset that supports all Indic languages.
But I am using intlfonts that bundles a wide range of fonts for Emacs.
And sadly, Tamil is missing in that package. :(

Prologue:
   * I am hacking together an application. I need to store a list of some
files in one program.

   * Another program must read this list and perform some actions.

   * The files can be of three  different categories. I use separate lists
while computing these.
      I need to recover them as separate lists too.

   * I am using Python at the moment for this.

Question:
    Which format do I use?

    I am kinda undecided because of the tradeoffs between xml, yaml and
pickling

    If I choose yaml which has been my personal favorite because I have used
it more often in
the past with Ruby. But python yaml libs do not come with python. I would be
adding an extra
dependency.

    If I use pickling, I would actually be restricting it to python. So a
future C app may not be
able to use the older files

    If I use XML. Err. I do not know to use XML from inside languages. But
is it worth the time
spent in learning to use the XML libraries?

Apart for support from the grammar, we need the font support in
console. As of now, very few (may be 1 or 2) TSCII and ISCII PSF
fonts are available and the readability is very poor.=20

*AFAIK*, no of chars and combinations are very less in Western
languages. In Japan, China and Arabic, the no of chars are more, but
the dimension of the each chars are more or less same.

In our case, no of chars and combinations are more, and dimension of
the chars are also differ. For example, result of combination may add
1/2/3 new symbol(s) on the top, bottom, left, right or all side :)=20
Handling all with std console is nearly impossible.

In 2000, as part of IndLinuX project, we tried the console support for
our languages with ISCII and Multi-Glyph technique. Tamilinux group
also created the TSCII PSF font and key-mapping for typing Tamil in
console. After that, due to increase in Indic support in GUI, no
effect for UTF-8 Indic support in console.

Pretty much. You have minidom, expat, pyrxp, elementree at your disposal
which cater to different kind of uses - but all working on XML.
define your own schema and write a custom wrapper(writer/reader) for it.
Always adhere to KISS when using XML.

I hope, xmllib.XMLParser or simple RSS parser examples may give some

You need not have separate semantics for them. Just naming them
different would do.

Just use plain old text files and file I/O. ;)

Or use FIFOs using mkfifo(1).

Python has different methods to achieve this and I hardly ever use
python unfortunately. I certainly love the language no doubt but never
wrapped my head around it.

However perl can trivially do what I mention.

I think you can create a python dictionary/tuple from files?

Perhaps someone more knowledgeable can help.

Best of luck!

Is terminal-based Level 2 unicode support:
 (a) possible?
 (b) desirable?

given that unicode is now a standard followed by all decent programming 
languages and applications, it is both possible and desirable.

Supporting Indic on plain console may be difficult. Bcoz of the VGA
char buffer size limitation.  With frame buffer, may be bit easy (not
sure). So I say, It is possible.

IMO, It is not desirable ;)

Well.. Ok. I will try XML for it.
Thanks all

@Girish: I did not mean File IO. The program must just be able to read a
list of files into it.
This will be a configuration file that helps it decide which file to keep,
delete or add. The files
by themselves will be available in a tarball. It is a semi-decent attempt at
a tarball level diff.
I am doing it to get a grasp of python myself. :D

The HP laserjet 1018, 1020 printers etc do not work with the hplip
packages alone You need to use the foo2zjs drivers for them. Get them
from http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/

The page itself has a good guide for installing it.

Then this will give you a good way to set it up using cups admin
http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/cups/hp1020.html

(It assumes that you have already set up a cups user. I do not know about
ubuntu.
But I had to set it up by myself for arch using lppasswd -a <username>)


Then switch off the printer. And switch it back on and try!

It maybe beacuse xmlhttp variable is undefined.

Also, this is not related to Linux. You'd be better off asking this question
in a forum/mailing list dedicated to web programming.

If you use jQuery,

http://jquery.com

Ajax is a piece of cake. Actually it tastes like the famous Black Forest
cake.

Nice, soft and tasty. ;)

Anyway you have to include jquery like this.

<script src="jquery-latest.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script>

$(function() {

	$('div').load("<ajax url");

});


As you can see, jQuery is very simple since it does all the Ajax work of
XMLHTTPRequest and what not behind the scenes.

There are also advanced Ajax functions in jQuery but I have been able to
do a lot with the simple $(<selector>).load() call.

Hope this helps.

Best of luck!

Hello,

Some more thinking aloud on this issue.

On Tue, 18 Nov 2008, Kapil Hari Paranjape wrote:

It is inherently difficult for a terminal to do this.

The reason is that terminals usually deal with "character at a time"
processing.  The point is that combining characters appear _later_ in
the input stream and modify the display of characters that already
came before.

Of course, terminals _could_ redraw the display repeatedly as
combining characters are input and the character to be displayed is
changed (for example see how this is done with yudit). With modern
processing speeds and double buffered displays this may not cause too
much "flashing".

Bharathi has also raised the problem of fixed width fonts leading to
ugli-ness. Since proportional width terminal fonts can cause their
own set of difficulties (for example if you refer to columns in your
curses application), we will probably have to live with some
ugliness in terminal displays.

There is also the requirement that the original input stream must
also be buffered for scroll-back cut and paste capabilities.

Regards,

Kapil.

sorry if i am asking a very trivial question,
but what is the difference between using 'set' and printenv. I mean
using something like 'set|grep HOSTNAME' would also give the same
information right ??
is there any special purpose for printenv ??

Dear ILUGC,

A Debian developer (Christoph Haas) has developed a Debian Screenshots
website, where users can contribute screenshots of their favourite
Debian packages, as well as browse existing ones. You can find the
site here:

http://screenshots.debian.net/

I figured some people might be interested in this service.

"set" tells you what shell variables are defined (and does other
things besides this). This is not the same as environment variables.
Only the latter are passed to the commands.

"env" is another alternative but it is also a way of running a
command with a different environment.

"printenv" does exactly what is needed --- not more and no less.

Kapil.

I could be wrong but only exported variables are present in the
environment.

For instance, 

$ i=5

and 

$ export i=5

are two different things.

Try this.

$ i=5
$ sh
$ echo $i

and 

$ export i=5
$ sh
$ echo $i

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

chkconfig -- Update/Show runlevel information for system services.

Summary:

'chkconfig' provides a simple command-line tool for maintaining the
/etc/rc[0-6].d directory hierarchy by relieving system administrators
of the task of directly manipulating the numerous symbolic links in
those directories.

A runlevel is a software configuration of the system which allows only
a selected group of processes to exist (man init).

Examples:

$ chkconfig --list -- List runlevel info for all system services.

$ chkconfig --list xinetd -- List runlevel info of xinetd service.

# chkconfig --add newser -- Add a new service for management.

# chkconfig --del oldser -- Remove this services symbolic links from 
                            all rc[0-6].d Dirs.

# chkconfig --level 35 xinetd on -- Start the xinetd service only in 
                                    runlevel 3 and 5.

Read: man chkconfig

Is there an equivalent that lets you do things like "service httpd start" ?

I hate having users type /etc/init.d/mydaemon start

Thanks, but what I meant was a general utility for my own server.

I want to maintain the server via "service trisul start/stop/restart" 
and chkconfig add./ del instead of having the admin fiddle with 
/etc/init.d directly.

Yes there exists such an utility. And surprisingly it's the same as
you guessed: 'service'. It works with CentOS 5, i.e., I can do things
like 'service httpd start|stop|status'. But I am not sure which
package(s) you'll need for this.

you can write a one line bash function called service() that invokes 
the /etc/init.d/<script> and passes it the parameter(s) it expects.

bash man page has enough info to get you started.

On distros that already have "service" (RHEL+derivatives, openSUSE etc.) 
name the function something else.

agreed. but the target audience is primarily newbies -- most of them are
outside the ambit of FOSS.IN. We also would like to catch the working
professionals -- hopefully as many will be free on saturday (even if they
could get enough freedays to go to bangalore) : another non intersecting set
with FOSS.IN.
Let us hope, many will get inducted into FOSS and can fruitfully attend
FOSS.IN 2009!

can i clean it?

In addition to the above, GRUB takes all of my menu.lst backup files with

my policy - never upgrade. Always do a fresh install. Useful to get rid of 
crud. Maintain your home directory and all config files under version 
control. Do a fresh install with reformatting the partitions and then an svn 
up. Also, a fresh install+ svn up will take about 1 fifth of the time that an 
upgrade will take. I once did a debian dist-upgrade which took a large amount 
of time and converted all my unicode pg databases to ascii. Never again. Some 
time back something went phut in my laptop and I had to reinstall - less than 
an hour and I was up and running.

Message-ID: <f3d38c890811200844g2c928de0q715872fa29ddd3e2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

This is really funny !

"Firms charge employees for Vista boot-up times- Getting themselves sued"

.....Apparently it has become an issue since the introduction of
Windows Vista where boot up and log out times are a lot longer.
Several outfits ? including AT &T, United Health Group and Cigna ?
have refused to stump up for time that their employees are idle
waiting for their computers to get in the mood to do some work. It
could only happen in America and since the companies are in the Land
of the Free they are also now being hit by some serious class
actions.....

http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2008/11/19/firms-charge-employees-vista

....Of course, if you are not being paid to log on and off why on
earth would you do it? We guess an employee could open a huge security
problem and refuse to log off every evening, or rip out the company
hard-drives and install flash memory and Linux instead. ?....

Okay ! who is now going to sue this software vendor for a buggy Os and
lost productivity, manhours , support calls , medical bills for
computer rage and nervous breakdown due to vista ?

Cheers

Rightly so.  Did the employees have any say in the acquisition of the 
Vista boxens?  After reading some of the comments I am surprised that 
there is no class action law suit.

Hi !

As per In the words of RFC 1855, the RFC Netiquette Guidelines, which
comprise a comprehensive set of voluntary netiquette conventions:

    If you are sending a reply to a message or a posting be sure you
summarize the original at the top of the message, or include just
enough text of the original to give a context. This will make sure
readers understand when they start to read your response.

He has taken care to edit  and do the same except that it was
reversed. But it serves the purpose.

I hope this "selective" policing  ends !

Cheers

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

fsck -- Linux File System Check and Repair Tool.

Summary:

'fsck' is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux file
systems. If no file-systems are specified on the command line, fsck
will default to checking file-systems in /etc/fstab file.

In actuality, fsck is simply a front-end for the various file system
checkers (fsck.cramfs, fsck.ext2, fsck.ext3, fsck.jfs, fsck.msdos,
fsck.reiserfs, fsck.vfat, ...) available under GNU/Linux OS.

Examples:

# fsck -- Check all file systems available in /etc/fstab.

$ fsck -N -- Don't execute. Just show what would be done.

# fsck -V -- Show detailed output, including all file system-specific
             commands that are executed.

# fsck -a -- Automatically repair the file system without asking for
             confirmations. (By default, ask for conformation).

# fsck /dev/hda2 -- Check the HDA2 device/partition.

# fsck /usr/local -- Check the /usr/local mount point.

# fsck LABEL=usr -- Check file-system, which has a label matching 
                    to "usr".

Read: man fsck

Yeah Right.. Somehow rolling releases always feel best for a personal
desktop.
I dont need all those debian security patches and it somehow gives me a
happy
feelin when I run "bleeding edge" stuff instead of old stuff with bleeding
edge
patches. And for rolling releases. 1) You can try debian sid (works like a
rolling
release :P) and 2) Archlinux.

And there are semi-rolling releases like foresight. Which rolls among minor
releases
but majors are not rolling

Hi All,

I need to set an environment variable. Following is what I did.

TMPDIRECTORY=/usr/local/tmp_directory

env |grep TMPDIRECTORY
<blank>
echo $TMPDIRECTORY
/usr/local/tmp_directory

export TMPDIRECTORY
set |grep TMPDIRECTORY
 /usr/local/tmp_directory

env |grep TMPDIRECTORY
 /usr/local/tmp_directory


Now I logged off as root as I had su 'ed in and then run the below commands.
Now when I checked in the env of the non root user, the value was not there.
Again I su 'ed and the variable was not set in there either. I need this
variable to stay in the system even after I log off as any user. How can I
make a variable stay. This variable is used in certain scripts to store tmp
content. Please advise.

Regards,
Ashish

What I meant was whether the new env variable needed to be added like the PS
variable or we could just add it like it is done at the shell.

The PS variable in the file is declared as below.
if [ "$PS1" ]; then
    case $TERM in
    xterm*)
        if [ -e /etc/sysconfig/bash-prompt-xterm ]; then
            PROMPT_COMMAND=/etc/sysconfig/bash-prompt-xterm
        else
            PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@
${HOSTNAME%%.*}:${PWD/#$HOME/~}\007"'
        fi

But in my case since I didnt require any ifs and thens, I actually  did what
you said, opened the file and added the line as the second last line in the
file and then sourced it. This solved the purpose.

TMPDIRECTORY=/usr/PATH/tmp
# vim:ts=4:sw=4

It is impossible to achieve your goal. The shell is invoked as the user
who logs in and variables can only be set by the logic rc scripts.

Your question is wrong and consequently your understanding of the way
UNIX works is also incorrect.

What do you want to achieve?

Your scripts should look either for files in /tmp for instance to check
for something that persists across logins or if you want the environment
approach, then only for variables that are exported into child shells as
long as the user does not logout of course. ;)

Best of luck!

Don't be so hard on the OP.  All he wants to do is setup the
environment on his box for all users, and his understanding of
unix is already improving as he's already already figured out
how to do it.

YES. People should learn from other replying, formatting and signature
styles. If they are NOT learning then there is NO point in being here. =20
And if we are NOT helping them to learn, then why are we here?

Sometime, few reply may be harsh. But no other way :)

I am not sure putting it in /etc/bashrc is a good idea. It might give rise to security issues as well as if some other admin changes it, everything will get affected. 

I would recommend you put it in each script before your commands
export var=<value>
and then chmod a+x that file.

Of course this will not work if there are too many places you are using this. In that case, your solution might be better.

I finally managed to prepare a HOWTO for hosting on AWS - http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dcn2ckbh_21gznbbjhr
Look at how I am taking backups in this tutorial - (Sec - 7.4)

I finally got round to writing down howtos for hosting on AWS. The tutorials are released under FDL.

The latest tutorial is hosting with Ruby Enterprise Edition and Phusion passenger. There is another link which is a tutorial for hosting with mongrel.

Hi !

Very interesting !

>From your blog ...
"We were looking for a replacement to a dedicated server. Once EBS was
launched, we immediately decided to move the site to AWS. The
Cost-benefit analysis is compelling...

This is very encouraging to know about Cloud computing in production
environments.
Is it possible to  have some rough idea about the cost benefit analysis ?

there are two types of people - those that use computers to do something they 
consider useful, and those that just use computers - for the second type, the 
concept of time does not exist.

I am not trying my hand at policing. But it is good netiqutte to not use
the enter key as a punctuation marker in IRC chats

eg:

Good:
<User>: I need help to get my etherent card configured, Fedora 9, Realtek
8139.

Bad
<User>: I need help
<User>: Need to get my card configured
<User>: Fedora 9
<User>: Realtek
<User>: 8139 chipset

On an email, the send button functions like the Return Key.

When you key in an email, remember there is no "Unsend button". So double
check
 what you actually want to send before actually sending it.

I find you split your messages a lot, Mr. Varadarajan Narayanan. Just ensure
you have
keyed in all that you need before sending. Dont keep patching like the
gentoo devs.

(It does happen. Suddenly you find yourself in a mess and it keeps
cascading)

I dont agree that that is good generalization. At times people get so
engrossed with
their work that they dont see time fly by.

And yeah.. Define "Useful". Having fun is serious business!
If all users of the system spend time doing "serious" stuff and keep dev-ing
apps,
who is left to use them?

The only time I notice time in my computer is at 1:00 for lunch and 8:00 for
dinner :P

Airbus just launched an international competition "Fly Your Ideas" for
student teams worldwide to come up with innovative ideas to shape the
future of aviation and help enhance the sector's eco-efficiency.



The objective: to create more value with less impact on the environment.



The competition is open to University students from around the world,
studying a degree, Masters or PhD in any academic discipline, from
engineering to marketing, business to science and philosophy to
design. The proposals can look at a wide range of topics including new
materials, products and/or processes as well as aircraft performance,
manufacturing and organizational and operational performance.



A top prize of ?30,000 is offered to the team whose idea demonstrates
the greatest potential for improvement. The teams will advance through
different competitive and challenging rounds, concluding with a live
final at the Le Bourget Airshow in June 2009.

Well, then you also need to have a look at it and understand what

I'm not an expert, but I guess this is because you're using the same home 
directory, and while in Spring you're using KDE3.5, which created a menu and 
kept the setting in your ~/.kde directory; with 2009 you're using KDE4 which 
keeps its settings in ~/.kde4. So, right now the new menu is pointing at stuff 
from both ~/.kde4 and ~/.kde. 

Of course, the experts would be able to point towards the exact issue. One 
place is the #mandriva IRC channel.

Didn't quite get this. The Grub lists all the other Linux installations for 
sure in my case.

Dear LUGS,
                       Now a days, Linux having more than 200 distros and
tons of packages. It is available with various sizes also. Then why Linux
customization is still needed?

Is it the power of Linux under GPL?
               or
All released Linux distros is not satisfy the users?

Padhu,

how many flavours of icecream are there? And why are users not satisfied? The

Hi !

Every user requirement is different. I do not think 200 is the correct
figure .I am sure that there are much more than that. Depends on what
you mean by distro also.

I  needed a " ROMable  with no writes  but not an embedded" kind of
linux for low cost PCs. I tried so many distros and still have about
60 or so Iso cds.Finally I had to make a custom Debian distro with
professional help.

Now "Netbooks" are coming with Linux and the whole scene is changing.
One-size-fits-all concept ( lIke XP) is gone now. And each is a custom
designed Linux distro with specially designed user interface and
matching the hardware just like your cell phone or PDA.

Even Mainstream distros have a Netbook or UMPC version. Eg Mandriva
and Xandros netbook version.

There is no exclusivity here !

It is the power of open source which is used to match the user ( or
Market) requirements.

Cheers

Varadarajan

I used to max at 5 distros during my 2nd year of Linux. I knew more than I
did
before and was under the impression that I was the next big thing in the
free
world. Now I am back to my senses. Just 1 distro that does what I want.

I feel I am going way Offtopic. Sorry about that

1. Are you 100% sure that your print server (built in with router) 
supports printing over http?

2. Is lpt1 the printer queue or the simply the port name?  Read the 
route documentation and confirm the print "queue" name associated with 
the printer port.

I am sure your router/print server supports "lpd" protocol as well.
In CUPS config. try lpd://192.168.1.10/<printer queue name>

And no, unlike Windows, the print queue will not show up on the list.  
You simply have to know it.  Some printer setup util. like in openSUSE 
can probe and verify if the lpd daemon is accepting jobs.

Message-ID: <46600.127.0.0.1.1227418606.squirrel@host.b4uindia.net>

Hi all,
 I want to configure mailing list on my domain glug4muz.org. For this
first of all I created an email account with address
mailing_list@glug4muz.org. Then for testing purpose I sent a mail to this
email account from my personal email account pankaj@glug4muz.org. And the
mail was received in the email account mailing_list@glug4muz.org. Then I
created a mailing list from cpanel with name Mailing_List on the same
domain. Then in the General Options Section of administrative page of
this mailing list, I set the values of "list administrator email
addresses" as well as "list moderator email addresses" to the email
address mailing_list@glug4muz.org. I also set the values of some other
parameters such as "An introductory description" and "List-specific text
prepended to new-subscriber welcome message". I also checked the box
"Acknowledge the member's posting". Then I clicked on "Membership
Management" and then "Mass Subscriptions". Then I subscribed my email
address pankaj@glug4muz.org to this mailing list. And now when I am
sending email to mailing_list@glug4muz.org from my email address
pankaj@glug4muz.org then I am NOT getting that mail in email account
mailing_list@glug4muz.org. Even I clicked on "Go to the general list
information page" to go to the URL

There is a third type - consultants who make a living out of Linux 
support and solutions.   IMO, they need to know at least the major 
distros Debian, CentOS (RHEL), openSUSE (Novell/SUSE), Ubuntu, 
Mandriva.  Today, one can standardize on one distro as "host OS" 
install the rest as VMs.

Message-ID: <f3d38c890811230945i72e0fe73h14443859eb5cbb77@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/

.......AWS Hosted Public Data Sets provide a convenient way to share,
access, and use public data within your Amazon EC2 environment. Select
public data sets are hosted on AWS for free as an Amazon EBS snapshot.
....Common use cases for these public data sets would include
scientific research, academic studies, and market research. Our goal
is to provide easy access to commonly used public data sets like the
human genome, astronomy data, and the United States census
information......

The implications of this technology are tremendous !

......For the first time in the history of human kind, regular people
from home can do the sort of high performance computing that had been
previously limited to major governments and corporations. If we are
truly in living in the information age, then you can think of this as
the information age on steroids, or information age 2.0.......

Welcome to the future folks ! And thanks to Linux and virtualisation !

Hi,

I heard from credible sources that few schools (PSBB, for example) in
Chennai are using the Asus EEE PC [1] for their day-to-day
school/home-work. I believe they are using windoze on it.

Can anyone (maybe any alumni?) check at their schools regarding the
daily class use of the EEE PCs? If possible, a FOSS workshop
targetting the Asus EEE PC can be done for the teachers, students, and
parents?

Hi Girish,


Why I set the parameter in /etc/bashrc is because, this file gets executed
for every user at login. Further, I also did "source" of the file for the
already logged in users. This made the variable available for all the users.
Please suggest what else should /could be done.

Ashish

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0811241558370.1448-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

One Day One GNU?Linux Command 
=============================

umount -- UnMount File System

Summary:

The umount command detaches the file system(s) mentioned from the file
hierarchy. A file system cannot be unmounted when it is `busy', For
example, when there are open files on it, or when some process has its
working directory there, or when a swap file on it is in use.

Examples:

# umount /mnt/cdrom -- Unmount the CDROM, using mount point.

# umount -v /dev/cdrom -- Unmount the CDROM, using device file and 
                          show verbose messages.

# umount -f /nfs/home -- Force unmount (Useful in case of an
                         unreachable NFS system).

# umount -l /media/floppy -- Lazy unmount (I don't care, why the
                             device is busy).

# umount -n /mnt/cdrom -- Unmount, with-out updating the /etc/mtab,
                  which contains the list of currently mounted FSs.

Read: man umount

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0811241956470.22712@chi.spunge.org>


Hi,
I have been trying to totally move from Windows to Linux. Currently I am
using only in dual boot.

I very often required to work from home connecting to my office pc through
my Dell Inspiron 6000 notebook(My office desktop having Windows XP
professional edition).

Currently I am forced to use Windows in my notebook to connect to the
office desktop through the corporate portal. Because only Windows is said
to only support remote connection using the "passage" portal client which
uses F5 firewall(something to citrix client they told). The passage client
currently looks for antivirus in the connecting machine, and does have
updated patches in windows using the activeX controls. I am not able to
get much more details of it though.

I do not have control or say to suggest them to move to linux, because it
is corporate decision.

So, if some one could suggest a tool which will help me to connect to my
windows machine through their passage portal using Linux(ubuntu) of my
laptop, it would help me.

Thank you very much,
carti

Hi,

One of my friend suggested this very useful article/book. "structured
learning in Computer Science" by Prof.S.V.Raghavan. This Professor is from
IITM.

I searched extensively as much as I can for quite some time. But I could
not get hit with the luck of getting it.

If any body is able to provide the article or the pointer, it will be of
great help.

I know, it may not be good to ask for this help. But I did good amount of
my homework and came unsuccessful. I thought that this information will
not only help me, but also others. So, sent here.

Thanks and regards,

Message-ID: <8a73677c0811250122i609cfd94yf5490aee5199fd68@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have two files, A and B. File A has a number of lines that has to be
searched in file B and if it occurs in any line, the whole line has to be
removed from file B.

I am trying to write a bash script to accomplish this task. My script is as
below:

1: #!/bin/bash
2: cat file_a | while read a;
3: do
4:     sed -i \"/$a/ d\" file_b
5: done

For some reasons, the sed command gives error. *sed: -e expression #1, char
1: unknown command: `"'*

When I echoed the above line 4 in the script, it is displayed as *sed -i
"/aaa/ d" file_b*, which is correct. I also confirmed it by manually
executing the command echoed by the script. It works. Could anybody let me
know what is going wrong in my script?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Alexander

Usually sed gives such problem when you have variable in it. Are 
you sure $a does not have any char which will break the 
expression ? (like '/ char)

BTW, looks like you are doing a while loop did you try echoing all 
the lines ?

The string $a does have comma(,) and dot(.) characters. But, it worked for
me when I gave the command *(sed -i "/some_x,a.b.c/ d" file_b)* in the
prompt.

Yes. The text was printed correctly.

            Normally the toggle key is Ctrl+Alt+F1(F1 to F7 will work
by default. F7 is the GUI).

Is Open Source Software a Race To Zero?

gozunda writes "My company is an open source software
vendor/developer. We maintain a popular open source project and keep
ourselves afloat by producing commercial products derived from or
extending the value of the core project. Over time we've seen our
business model eroding as other open source projects produce free
versions of the same extensions and utilities that are our bread and
butter. Something that was worth $5K last year is suddenly worth $0
because the free version is just as good as the paid. This same cycle
is obviously having an impact on pure-play commercial software
vendors. Is open source ultimately a race to zero? In ten years will
there be any cost associated with commodity (non-custom) software? If
not, will there still be a 'software industry' as it exists today, or
will software simply be a by-product of the operation of other
industries? Is that a good thing or a bad thing? As a professional
developer, do I need to fear this or feed it?"


Do you have any answer for these questions ?

IT Governance is not longer just desirable: It is mandatory. Business
profitability is now highly (or sometimes totally) dependent on the IT to
provide availability, dependability, security and performance of IT services
which in turn drives business services. IT, previously a support element,
has become the basis for value. IT is now the basis for creating value, for
competition, and distinctive performance. IT services are now part of the
fabric of the business and customers expect guaranteed levels of service 

Top 5 Benefits of ITIL. 
.  Increased user and customer satisfaction with IT services 
.  Improved service availability, directly leading to increased business
profits and revenue 
.  Financial savings from greenuced rework, lost time, improved resource
management and usage 
.  Improved time to market for new products and services 
.  Improved decision making and optimized risk

 There are some lines of work that few will enter except for money;
road construction, for example. There are other fields of study and
art in which there is little chance to become rich, which people enter
for their fascination or their perceived value to society. Examples
include mathematical logic, classical music, and archaeology; and
political organizing among working people. People compete, more sadly
than bitterly, for the few funded positions available, none of which
is funded very well. They may even pay for the chance to work in the
field, if they can afford to.

Such a field can transform itself overnight if it begins to offer the
possibility of getting rich. When one worker gets rich, others demand
the same opportunity. Soon all may demand large sums of money for
doing what they used to do for pleasure. When another couple of years
go by, everyone connected with the field will deride the idea that
work would be done in the field without large financial returns. They
will advise social planners to ensure that these returns are possible,
prescribing special privileges, powers, and monopolies as necessary to
do so.

This change happened in the field of computer programming in the past
decade. Fifteen years ago, there were articles on "computer
addiction": users were "onlining" and had hundred-dollar-a-week
habits. It was generally understood that people frequently loved
programming enough to break up their marriages. Today, it is generally
understood that no one would program except for a high rate of pay.
People have forgotten what they knew fifteen years ago.

When it is true at a given time that most people will work in a
certain field only for high pay, it need not remain true. The dynamic
of change can run in reverse, if society provides an impetus. If we
take away the possibility of great wealth, then after a while, when
the people have readjusted their attitudes, they will once again be
eager to work in the field for the joy of accomplishment.

The question, "How can we pay programmers?" becomes an easier question
when we realize that it's not a matter of paying them a fortune. A
mere living is easier to raise.

What Is Software Productivity?

If software were free, there would still be programmers, but perhaps
fewer of them. Would this be bad for society?

Not necessarily. Today the advanced nations have fewer farmers than in
1900, but we do not think this is bad for society, because the few
deliver more food to the consumers than the many used to do. We call
this improved productivity. Free software would require far fewer
programmers to satisfy the demand, because of increased software
productivity at all levels:

    * Wider use of each program that is developed.
    * The ability to adapt existing programs for customization instead
of starting from scratch.
    * Better education of programmers.
    * The elimination of duplicate development effort.

Those who object to cooperation claiming it would result in the
employment of fewer programmers are actually objecting to increased
productivity. Yet these people usually accept the widely-held belief
that the software industry needs increased productivity. How is this?

"Software productivity" can mean two different things: the overall
productivity of all software development, or the productivity of
individual projects. Overall productivity is what society would like
to improve, and the most straightforward way to do this is to
eliminate the artificial obstacles to cooperation which reduce it. But
researchers who study the field of "software productivity" focus only
on the second, limited, sense of the term, where improvement requires
difficult technological advances.

While installing I had chosen "Ubuntu Desktop" in software package 
option instead of  KDE/GNOME though it was one of the option to choose. 
Was it due to this?

You have raised some interesting questions.

This is a phenomena that happens in all industry/country.  We have to 
re-engineer our skill sets to match the needs of the time.

I worked for a major Telecom manufacturer (11+ years) but saw the 
writing on the wall when nascent companies like Cisco challenged the 
incumbents.  I changed my field to IT (self taught) and discovered 
Linux/FOSS in my quest to get an Unix like system.

Most adjust and a few do not.  Those who adjust come out much stronger 
from the adversity they face.  Many of my engineer friends (in the US) 
have moved on to completely different fields because their jobs went to 
other countries and they are doing quite well.

       When replying to a list, the reply goes to all the members. So
if a cc is added, the person gets another copy of the mail. So please
avoid using cc to list members.

Also, for commercial advertisements on courses that are on open source
technologies , please add the commercial tag as well, along with the
OT tag.

Ten years ago I paid more than Rs. 10 per minute for an STD call
today I pay Rs. 1-2.

15 years ago a typical *nix workstation cost in excess of Rs. 12
Lakhs and it came without any compilers or worthwile software except
the O/S.

20 years ago a dozen apples cost about Rs. 20 or less whereas today
you would be lucky to get one or two!

Draw your own morals,

Kapil.

Did your friend get this from Slashdot?  Came across similar lines in 
another blog 
<http://ct.techrepublic.com.com/clicks?t=72709271-908c1e7315fcfdf050a4eab841c4eafa-bf&brand=TECHREPUBLIC&s=5>

A reference to the original article would have been the proper thing to 
do.

software is not a commodity to be bought or sold. The fact that it is treated 
as a commodity is an aberration which will be corrected in the course of 
time.

Depends on how your friend sees 'software' and how it reflects as a line
item in the books of accounts.

A commonly (mis)used way to view software is as a commodity and hence
living in fear of the next competitor who undercuts your price is a
norm. With the passage of time, software bits would cease to have a
price and the business model around software would have to morph into
something that makes sense socially and economically while being
profitable enough to be sustaining a community. However, that would also
require some overloading of meaning to the term 'software'.

Software businesses based on loss leader model won't work out precisely
because software is not a commodity.

Dear Cool Shiva

Your primary problem is that your name service resolver is not
managing to resolv the addresses that you have for
us.archive.ubuntu.com etc.

This is your secondary problem. Do you really want to install all
possible compix packages? Both kde and gnome and all dev packages as
well. Wild card package installations are generally a bad idea.

Your network connection is not active. Or maybe the DNS in your
/etc/resolv.conf is not reachable!

hi,

I want to install grub on my flash drive,

I did

/sbin/fdisk -l

No matter how I layout the partitions in the drive, this error pops up.

Any pointers would be helpful.

Since the filesystem type is unknown how is grub supposed to deal
with it?

This probably means that the filesystem has not been created on
/dev/sdb1

Got this out of fdisk

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdb1   *           1        1023      261872   83  Linux
/dev/sdb2            1024        7656     1698048    b  W95 FAT32
_______________
Tried with mkfs.ext3 to use the whole disk
with no luck.
Should I do anything else before attempting to
get grub onto it?

Thnx

The "Linux" here is only a "tag". It does not mean that a file system
has been created!

It looks like you have not install GNU/Linux on your system. So just
putting grub will not do much! Of course, if you do
 mke2fs /dev/sdb1
the error message from grub will probably go away but it will not
solve your problem --- which we have to guess, since you have not
stated it.

Hi !

Please mention what you are trying to do with your flash disk !
Are you trying to install a Linux distro in it ?
Grub will be written automatically unless you chosen not to install
for some reason.
Are you using a USB adapter or IDE adapter ?

Message-ID: <1a4d56380811261957k579bc73er663cee8272ec4ea9@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am doing my MCA project in LAMP .In my project ,I have one requirement to
create multiple referral :my requirement is

I have one table with cust_id ,cust_name,referal_name . I am using this
query to create that table
create table customers(cust_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY
KEY ,cust_name VARCHAR(25) default NULL,referal_name VARCHAR(25) default
NULL);

insert into customers(cust_id,cust_name)values (1,'ram');
insert into customers(cust_id,cust_name)values (2,'raj','ram');
insert into customers(cust_id,cust_name)values (3,'kumar','raj');
insert into customers(cust_id,cust_name)values (4,'ragu','kumar');
insert into customers(cust_id,cust_name)values (5,'rajesh','ragu');

It looks like this:

cost_id      cust_name     referal_name
1               ram                NULL
2               raj                  ram
3               kumar             raj
4               ragu               kumar
5               rajesh             ragu


I am not able to understand the logic behind the multiple refferel .what i
want to do is i want upto 4 level referals
i.e,My requirement is to display upto 4 revel referals.for example just take
kumar in above table it will display

                 ram  <--------------- raj <---------- kumar---------> ragu
-------------> rajesh

i want to display grant father ,father ,sun and grand sun of kumar.
kumar----->raj  (kumar refered by raj)
raj --------->ram (raj refered by ram)
kumar------>ragu(ragu refered by kumar)
ragu  ------->rajesh (rajesh refered by ragu)

This is one my requirement .I want to do this without using joint query . I
don't have any idea how to select and display those information from above
table .I am googled it but badly i am not able  get any information .any one
can help me please.I think it can achive using dinemic loop but i am not
able to realise how will do it . please help me.

Thanks for your time

i am not doing your project for you - try it out and see if it works, or check 
subselect syntax in the postgresql manual. (If you pay me 1,00,000 in 
advance, I will write your project for you)

Hi Ramar,

If I have understood u right. You want the output from the below table to
be  like

tablex

emp        refby
kumar     raj
raj          ram
ram        ragu
ragu       rajesh

kumar was refered by raj, who was referred by ram, who was referred by ragu,
who was referred by rajesh
Try the below and see;


declare
var1 VARCHAR(20);
var2 VARCHAR(20);
var3 VARCHAR(20);
var4 VARCHAR(20);
var5 VARCHAR(20);

begin

var1=kumar;
   loop
         select refby into var2 from tablex where emp=var1;
         select refby into var3 from tablex where emp=var2;
         select refby into var4 from tablex where emp=var3;
         select refby into var5 from tablex where emp=var4;
    dbms_output.put_line
    var1 || "was referred by" || var2 ||  "who was referred by" || var3
||   "who was referred by" ||  var4 ||  "who was referred by" || var5;

 end loop;
end;
Regards,
Ashish

Please don't encourage such behaviour regardless of the money offered.  It only makes these chaps think that everything can be bought for money and the thinking permeates into other aspects of their lives (read corruption).

I have personally come across students who got their BCA/MCA/B.Tech projects done by professionals.  I do not know if this true but I have heard that there are companies who do such things for a revenue stream.  

I have no issues with professional prep materials, study books, flash cards etc. but this is too much.

ok, from the top thenI've a fedora sys installed with a 2.26.27.3 kernel I
compiled.
would like to install a linux system onto my pendrive.

I connect the pendrive through my USB.
It s a 2 gig kingston.

Sometime earlier I read a similar fd lin system.
@
http://www.pocket-linux.org/

I understand that the obvious choice in my case would be to get dsl or
Nimble on to my pen drive.
However, I would like to understand how everything fits together by putting
together one myself.

I've tried the fdisk and mkfs.ext3 tools with no luck.
In both cases I get the same grub error.

I'm using the grub already installed in my system.

Will give syslinux a go too.

Any suggestions,pls?

HI all,

We are trying to connect a Reliance data card (new model - EC121) to
Ubuntu 8.04 and we are not able to. I have used reliance other USB cards
before with linux and configuring it was not a problem.I've pasted below
the details of the things we tried, can you guys please help us? The
Main problem is that modem is not getting reconized. This is due to the
fact that device has usb storage to store windows driver etc. as well as
modem. Due to this Linux kernel drivers get confused.

We tried using USB mode switch too, but it didnt work. Can you please
let us know if what we are doing is correct?

 but gving me nothing.

I updated wvdial.conf with following info
[Modem0]
        Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0
        Baud = 115200
        SetVolume = 0

        Password = and Password 
        Phone = #777
        Stupid Mode = 1
        Inherits = Modem0

then thr' terminal tried to connect to card by
$ wvdial cdma (gives me following)
--> WvDial: Internet dialer version 1.60
--> Warning: section [Dialer cdma] does not exist in wvdial.conf.
--> Cannot open /dev/modem: No such file or directory

Problem here is modem not getting reconized. This is due to the fact
that device has usb storage to store windows driver etc. as well as
modem. Due to this Linux kernel drivers get confused.
Then I searched more on problem got to know about "usb_modeswitch", 
http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/
Tried steps there but still  nothing is working for me.
Has anyone tried to use reliance EC121 for internet connection pl.

Linux kernel driver doesn't get confused. The device first presents
itself as a USB mass storage device, and the Linux kernel should
detect it properly. Check in /var/log/messages output.

What did you try? What was the output?

You need to use usb_modeswitch as:

  sudo /path/to/usb_modeswitch-0.9.5/usb_modeswitch -v 0x12d1 -p 0x1411 -H 1

Now, it should switch to modem configuration. Check in /var/log/messages.

It won't give you anything. Just that usbserial module will be loaded.
Check in /bin/lsmod output.

You have used Modem0 here.

So, why are you dialing for cdma? Hence, the following output:

---

| --> Warning: section [Dialer cdma] does not exist in wvdial.conf.
| --> Cannot open /dev/modem: No such file or directory
\--

In Modem0 configuration you have chosen /dev/ttyUSB0, but cdma
configuration is looking for /dev/modem.

am using firefox 2.0.0.13 - I have a lot of bookmark folders, but in 'add

doesn't wvdialconf detect the device correctly and setup the configuration file?

try running wvdial as root instead of sudo (it worked for me this way).

I am not sure if this will help. But here goes.
Use tilda. It is very useful for Gnome. KDE has yakuake. It can be
hidden(and brought back up) with a single key. Say F11. One more think I
used to do was have a gnome terminal running Full screen on one of the 4
desktops that come by default and multiplex it with screen. So I have 3 GUI
desktops and 1 CLI. You can increase the number of desktops as needed

When you do a "ps -ef | grep getty", do you see anything like this??

Using a dropin terminal is a great idea. I think that you can also do
this with any regular terminal like gnome-terminal by a suitable
keybinding using (say) xbindkeys.

Of course, if you want to use the "console mode" most of the the time
you may want to check out INX (INX is not X).

Subject: [Ilugc] What is Fedora ?
Message-ID: <1227937286.9346.10.camel@localhost.localdomain>

?This is an answer to the question "What is Fedora ?" by Jon Stanley
(FESCo). I thought this was important and hence it is here ( please
excuse me if you have already read this):

In Jon's words:

So I'm on both sides of the fence - Fedora contributor and RHEL
customer (as I suspect that many of us are). And the question does
come up a lot, so here's my "stock response":

Fedora's goal is to be the best of what works today. RHEL's goal is
to be the best of what works and is supportable for the next 7 years.
These are fundamentally incompatible goals, which cannot be served by
one distribution.

Fedora accomplishes it's goal by being a completely open and
transparent R&D lab, for both Red Hat and members of the community.
Anyone, whether you're working on Fedora in your spare time (as I do),
or if you have a mandate from your manager at Red Ha because they'd
like to see a particular feature in the next version of RHEL, can get
a feature into Fedora by following the same process. Let me make some
cases in point, using some features from Fedora 10.

First, from the community side, Hans de Goede (now a Red Hat employee,
but that's really irrelevant - he wasn't when he started work on the
feature and is employed doing something completely different), decided
that we needed better webcam support in Fedora. He defined the
problem space, worked to implement the drivers required in the
upstream kernel, and packaged a library to provide v4l2 access to v4l1
apps (sorry for the technical details there).

>From the Red Hat "features we'd like to see in RHEL" side (note that
this is speculation as to the motivation for this feature, but pretty
educated speculation), libvirt (which is the hypervisor-agnostic
virtualization mangement layer in Fedora/RHEL) can now remotely
provision storage and perform remote installations. These features
were again implemented upstream (even though we are upstream for
libvirt), thus making the improvements available for any consumer of
libvirt, Fedora included, packaged in Fedora, put through a test plan,
and accepted.

If it really were a fact that "Fedora is a perpetual beta of RHEL"
were true, two things would not be true:

1) The first feature would not be in Fedora, it provides very little
"enterprise" value (however does provide a lot of value in that we now
have a wider range of hardware that Just Works(TM) ).

2) I would not be a member of the Fedora Engineering Steering
Committee (FESCo) which decides on the technical direction of Fedora
and is in charge of the feature process.

I'm sorry that this has been long, but I really think that this is a
really important topic, and we (Fedora Marketing) need to find a way
to spread this sort of messaging.

-Jon


This is among the most discussed questions on the Fedora lists and above
is among the best answers I have ever heard of.

Hi folks

I wanted to install web cam which has a gspca driver module. I tried with it
m-a but it ended up with a error message.

then I tried to manually compile the source. its ended up with the following
error.

semaphore.h is not in /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.27-9/include. I think this
might be the prob..


does any one know how to install this driver kernel?

Message-ID: <ff9ab3f224594f581cfd71be7c10570f@dp1.avaaz.org>

   Hi,

   I just signed an urgent message calling for unity following the attacks in
   Mumbai. Read the email below - Thanks

   --------------------------

   Dear friends across India and the world,

   We're all feeling the shock of the awful attacks in Mumbai. All our hearts
   go out to the victims and their families.

   The attacks were aimed at our people, our prosperity and our peace. But
   their top target was something else: our unity. If these attacks cause us
   to turn on each other in hatred and conflict, the terrorists will have
   won. They know that hatred and chaos feed on division. As radical
   extremists, their only hope of winning is by turning the rest of us
   against each other.

   Let's deny them that victory. We're launching a message to extremists on
   all sides and all our political leaders, one that will soon be published
   in newspapers across India and Pakistan. The message is that these tactics
   have failed, that we're more united than ever, united in our love and
   support to each other, determined to work together against terror and call
   on our leaders to do the same. If millions of people sign it, our message
   will be unmistakable, click below to sign it and please forward this email
   widely:

   http://www.avaaz.org/en/india_undivided/98.php/?cl_tf_sign=1

   It's time to speak out, let's do it together.

   Thanks

I don't know exactly. But it looks to me, the driver code is not
compatible with the current kernel src.

Take a look at the following community versions a) Untangle, b) 
Groundwork, c) Zenoss.

A combination of the above should satisfy your requirements.  

It would be great if you share your implementation experience when you 
are done with the setup.

Why?  When people ask for programming help for their homework/project

We've done a rough implementation in python,php and rrdtool that satisfied
the academic
requirement and barely works

It was a lot of searching and repeated testing.

we would like to develop it to make it general purpose
we're done with the academic stuff and want to do something real.

Groundwork and zenoss has lot of ideas that we could pull into ours.

Thanks
