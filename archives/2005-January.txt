It might be possible to do it without a bootloader, but it's always better to 
have one. That way, you have one more fallback in case of crisis, especially 
with grub.

There is also the possibility of having two or more kernels, or two or more 
configurations for the system. Best to have a boot loader then.

The default options that Fedora throws up in the installation normally
do the job. Or you could select your harware manually while
configuring X when the option comes up while installing.

I think there is a command like xconfig or xconfigurator also.

We can't guide you with the limited information which
you have provided us.

More error related information is required.
Also include the Video Card Chipset/Monitor
Configuration which you are using along with the Error
Log.

You should know your display's horizontal
synchronization rate (HSYNC), vertical refresh rate
(VFSH) and video memory size. 

If you are using XFree86 use either "xf86config"
(script) or "xf86cfg" (graphical) to reconfigure your
X server setting.

If you are using Xorg use either "xorgconfig" (script)
or "xorgcfg" (graphical) to reconfigure your X server
setting.

Get to the console (Ctrl+Alt+F1), login as root, and run:

X -configure

This will drop an XF86Config (or xorg.conf if FC2 uses xorg) in /root. Copy 
this file (or move it if you prefer) to /etc/X11

If this doesn't work, manually configure using either xf86config (text mode) 
or xf86cfg (gui). XOrg's equivalents are xorgconfig and xorgcfg.

That should be all that's necessary, unless you want some extra things - then 
you've got to edit the file.

Hi All,

I am using Mandrake 10.1 distro. Recently i purchased
a linksys wireless network card and managed to get it
configured with the help of driverloader. 

I am able to list the accesspoints with iwlist and
have set all the necessary parameters for wirless with
iwconfig.  After this when i try to bring the wireless
interface with ifup, it fails to get an ip address. 

The message i get in /var/log/messages point to
failure in dhclient. Could some one help me why i am
unable to get a ip address with dhclient.  

Thanks for ur help.

regards,
kannan.

Configure an entry for eth2 in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/

Check if there's a file ifcfg-eth2 there, if not create one (look at ifcfg-eth0
in the same directory for a hint)

I mean delete .bash_history when closing the session (shell), so that
you do not miss the history feature and also gain some privacy.

I guess, doing an
$ rm -f ~/.bash_history

and then logging out is not going to work, because the file is going to get
created again when the shell exists.

By the way, if the system administrator wants to know what a user is doing,
(s)he just has to add a few lines of code to the kernel and log the execve
system call.

I dont think you'd have to download NVIDIA's drivers., if you are
using `sarge`., it should support NVIDIA.

Sarge does not come with  the non-free nvidia driver. The sarge driver
is the  native XF86  nvidia driver that  does not support  a gazillion
other features that are supported by the non-free driver from NVIDIA.

it used to be possible but afaik, linux removed the standalone boot
support in recent kernels - anyway it doesn't hurt keeping a boot
loader...even as far as the timeout 0 is concerned, ensure that your
boot command is correct before doing that - or atleast get a rescue
disk - any error would otherwise make your system unbootable. Even
then, keeping a timeout of say 2 seconds is better - enables you to
change your command line in case you need it - say you want a runlevel
of 3 - well, you won't be able to do much in 2 seconds anyway :)

it moves on...

Many of the configuring tools have very limited capabilities...editing
by hand is the best solution...man xorg.conf (or XF86Config) is
excellently maintained..I had a similar problem, and the culprit was
the hsync and vsync ranges of my monitor - I had to pull up my monitor
manual and key in the values.

it moves on...

Yes  I too had edited /etc/X11/XF86config.In the monitor section I deleted hsync and vsync line.When I executed startx it  probed the monitor (xfs it-self updated into CF86config) and I could get into GUI , but I am scared to suggest this, it had worked for me many times.

i am not suggesting deleting those lines - if your monitor has
problems, then the probe might be dangerous - also, all monitors can't
be probed correctly - fedora has never done it for my microtek - I
have always installed it from the text mode interface - but the
monitor manuals that come along are authoritative, right ???

ir moves on...

Dear LUG members,
I have a computer with the Intel 915 motherboard. Fedora Core 3 works
fine, but sound was not detected. But the latest drivers fro the ALSA
project worked. I now want to install Debian Sarge/Sid. I tried the
online installation method (I am in the IITM campus), but my hard disk
did not get detected (owing to lack of SATA support). Could you please
suggest a way of installing Debian on my system?

Thank you.

Oh ok., however.. I was not referring to the non-free driver., I
was referring to the native drivers.

Can someone confirm this....

I seem to be having much better performance with the native "nv" driver
than the "nvidia" driver.
I don't use OpenGL much in any of my apps so I stick with the "nv"
driver for most of the time.

Also, has anyone managed to get the nvidia drivers running with 2.6.10 ?
The driver install fails with "Cannot determine the kernel version"

Hi,

What do u mean by 'better performance' ? As far as 2d is concerned I
haven't found much of a difference between the two drivers - apart
from the fact that the non-free driver has one or two strange and
irritating bugs - such as - the screen flickering and tearing when I
use 'gmplayer' to play movies - the commandline version, i.e. mplayer
works just fine.

> I don't use OpenGL much in any of my apps so I stick with the "nv"

As far as 3d is concerned, the non-free driver is pretty damn good - I
get better performance  in linux compared to the windows as well -
almost 5 to 10 fps difference in quake3.

The "interactivity" seems to be much better when I use the "nv" driver.
With the non-free driver the pointer seems to skip a lot.
Switching between workspaces is much faster too.

Yes, 3D is much better with the non-free nvidia binary.

On my machine, I've found both the "nv" and "nvidia" driver perform
equally well for most 2D apps (atleast I could not differentiate their
performance/stability). However, "nvidia" driver performs best
for 3D apps (high-end games and other OpenGL applications). Infact,
UT2004 runs stable and fast on Linux when compared to Windows
2000 (with nvidia detonator drivers installed on my machine earlier).

I've got it working on Slackware (2.6.10-cko patched kernel) with
1.0-6629 version of nvidia driver.

Yes people. I forgot to give this news on the group as I was in Delhi
when all this was set up. Anyway I hope the seminar propels up Open
Source in our college.

My issues are purely 2D and under heavy load.
Heavy load for my desktop is 
*Firefox (5+ tabs)
*X-Chat (5+ tabs)
*Thunderbird
*GNOME 2.8
*GAIM
*gnome-terminal (3+ tabs)
	-- tab1 runs apt-get
	-- tab2 runs kernel/software compilation
	-- bash
*XMMS
*OOImpress + gedit

The box is a Pentium 4 3.0Ghz /w 512M
Graphics Card is a GeForce FX 5900 XT /w 128M

Try running the following apps, first with "nvidia" and then with "nv"

With "nv" the interactivity is fluent where as with "nvidia" my mouse
skips a few events.
Workspace switching is slow.

Probably because this is a kernel issue.
I'm running 2.6.10 /w ckdev patchset + inotify.

Also the best test would be to cat a huge file to /dev/null or /dev/zero
And then generate random X Events and check the interactivity.

Ah, a -ck patchset user :)

Also, I run the same driver version on Sarge.
I've tried the following methods but still no success

* A plain run of the installer
* installer with the -ae switch
* extract the package and running a "make-install"

The driver installs fine on my stock Sarge Kernel.

I guess the issue is mostly related to gtk2 widget library. I find the
combination awfully slow on both "nv" and "nvidia" driver as well. I'm
on an AMD AthlonXP 1800+, 256MB RAM, GeForce2/MX with 64 MB RAM machine.
Even on my other box (an old Pentium 233 MMX, 64 MB RAM, Riva TNT2 with
32 MB RAM box), I dont see any much difference between the two drivers
(yes, I managed to run Gnome 2.8 for the heck of it!). 

Though Gnome is somewhat slow in starting applications, popping menus
and so on, the interactivity seems normal on both drivers on my
machines. 

Do you find the same performance difference using apps that run on
Qt/fltk/motif/imlib ?

Perhaps this has something to do with "HWCursor" option (under video
drivers section) in your xorg.conf ? Or maybe I'd blame it on driver
support for your specific hardware. 

X cursor looks beautiful with "nvidia" driver on my box, as I use
HWCursor and CursorShadow enabled.

On my kernel, I had to do --extract-only and then do a "make install"
from the sources.

Tried this too (cat /dev/urandom > /dev/null). Highly responsive on my
lean setup, and on KDE, but on Gnome, there were glitches with both "nv"
and "nvidia" drivers. Screen freeze/jerky behaviour when I try moving a
firefox window randomly across the screen. 

However, my system might be too slow/outdated for Gnome to really test
the performance difference between the 2 drivers.

Menu, Search, Corss-Ref and many other facilities.

Examples:

$ info  -- List all info pages available in the system.

$ pinfo -- Curses based lynx-style info browser.

$ info  emacs -- Show Emacs info page. (See man emacs, to feel the

You can also use the EMACS info browser, or KDE's info:/

Don't know about Gnome, though...

Yes. Very much so. But, you have to create the same accounts that you 
created in your previous installation and click on Tools -> Import and 
select the type of back-up and click ok. Even if you can't see all your 
mails right now, once you create the mail accounts, your mails will be 
visible.

Message-ID: <20050104103703.94537.qmail@web41721.mail.yahoo.com>

I am running Fedora Core 2 server. I installed a VNC
server in it and I am able to access it thru a VNC
client from windows desktop. 
    But I am getting only the basic X server loaded. I
am not able to get any Desktop Env, Gnome or KDE. 

Is it possible to remotly access the Gnome or KDE
desktop 

And also is it possible to the Windows XP Remote
Desktop Connection to connect to the Fedora VNC server.

1) If you're using KDE, there's something in Control Center->Internet and 
network->desktop sharing. This is what you've got to use. I don't know about 
others...

2) No, AFAIK, XP Remote desktop is proprietary.

The default Desktop Environment will start up.
If you want GNOME or KDE then set them up accordingly as the default 
Desktop Environment.

Yes I thnk but it all depends on the set up I believe. We had WinAxe
in our labs and it used to take a hell lot of time to start the
desktop

Wow. That's a new one. Windows through Linux. Maybe you mean, Windows on Linux.

> if i do means it won't affect my MBR(master boot record) operations?

It sure will. It will conk off your Linux Boot loader right out of the
MBR and pop in ntldr up there i think. Microsick Windoze. It's really
sick. Does not detect the presence of any other Non-MS OS on your
system and takes up your MBR without letting you know. That's what the
world's most popular proprietary OS does.

Better option would be to install Linux on Windows or put your way.
Linux through Windows.

So after that all you need to do is to boot in with a linux boot floppy, 
or with a bootable CD, and run lilo or grub again to put it back in the 
MBR, once it has been setup to dualboot linux and windows.

No problem at all.

This is event is for you then. Vellore Institute of Technology is organsing
a symposium on Free 

and Open SOurce software technologies titled Swatantra(6th - 7th Feb, 05). 

Founder of GNu and the man responsible for coining the term Free SOftware,
Richard M Stallman 

will be there to deliver the keynote address of the symposium and to answer
all the questions 

that you have always wanted to ask about these amazingly simply yet
inherently complex programs.

The event will also feature various competitions to kindle your nack for
Linux tweaking and 

tuning such as:- 

LINSTALL-- The Linux installation challenge.
Anaconda !! YaSt !! familiar with all these name?  Have been installing on
your system for a long 

time and you find it fun?? making the X server run?? configuring the boot
loader?? ..YES??..One 

event where apply all your skills which you developed over the years by
trying to install 

GNU/Linux on your system.

yourself! Come and 

demonstrate that your are the best at the best webserver that there is and
ever was.....

CORE WARS-- Challenge the memory
This event will feature an old game called core wars which involves
destroying your opponents 

programs by overwriting the memory in which this program is stored. It will
kindle the nerves of

Check your $HOME/.vnc/xstartup

You should be having your desktop environment in this file.
For other info check man vncserver.

Hi,
I want to insert new line(empty line) at the end of

To be more clearer,
How to insert "tab"(\t as in c programming) and
"newline"(\n as in c programming) through  the
substitution command(1,$s/oldtext/newtext/g).

I have given the sample of original and the modified
text at the end.

Thanks and regards,

P.S: Google did not come to my rescue

Eg:
<original.txt>
line one
line two
line three

<after_replacing.txt>
line one

line two

line three

Hi,
Just go to command mode
Type
:map k o^[j

The ^[ is ctrl+v ctrl+[ combination

Now keep pressing k and the new lines get added.

Also if you want one keystroke use this
:map k o^[jk
Now press k once

:%s/$/\r To insert new line at the end of each line in the file.
Similarly you can use \t for tabs.

# Uncomment the following two lines for normal

I am now able to access my GNOME desktop from my

4.0 viewer in windows. It is able to connect only if I
specify the IP with port 3.  192.168.100.1:5901. Is
this can be corrected.

One info to share with you, the remote desktop is very
very clear and also fast than the remote desktop

case I had set the resolution the highest available

Thanks for guidence.

Hi!

    The sound system doesn't seem to be working in my debian system
eversince I changed my user settings. One fine day, I  turned on my
system and logged into xfce only to see a blank panel with all the
settings gone. Then I did something foolish. I created another user
with the same directory as the home directory. Now, my settings were
gone forever.

       Suddenly my sound stopped working. All apps like Juk and
rhythombox started crashing on startup and xmms keeps quiet. Fed up of
all this , I logged in as root and my joy knew no bounds. Sound was
working. Now how do I make it work for me?

      Also, how should I specify proxy settings for my Epiphany web
browser. Previously it was working fine. But after this incident, it
stopped working.

Hello everyone,

Of late, I've often felt the need to annotate some of the emails I
get. Like attaching a quick virtual post-it to the email with some
context info or my thoughts.

Is there any way I can do this? I am okay with storing annotations
meta data on the client side only but if there's some way to make it
work server side - meaning storing meta data with the original email
on the mail server - that would be killer.

If there are no current solutions, any thoughts on how one might
implement such functionality? If we were to implement a server side
solution, are there any unused fields in the email message format that
can be exploited?

Regds,

Deepak.

Almost all distributions come with tools to configure printers (and
cups). Which distro are you running?

Also, what kind of printer is it? I don't know what a windows printer
is... if it's a network printer, then CUPS works marvelously. If it's
a printer attached to a windows PC and then shared.. then things might
get slightly difficult.

It is a printer connected to the windows machine, it is not a network
printer.

you can add x-headers to the email

x-thoughts: whatever

then have mutt display that header, or have procmail tag based on it 
(you can add the header using procmail as well)

just googling for php mail sendmail should find him some stuff to speed

these up will involve extensive spoonfeeding if he doesnt bother to do

Please take care of the wiki page naming conventions.  It must not
contain '/' unless there is an explicit hierarchy. If you are
confused, see my wiki page (in my sig.)

So please, 'move' [1] it to a different name.

[1] Move operation in mediawiki will redirect to the moved page if the

Linux Books, Materials.etc., wishes to give me. I stay @ tambaram.

This is a nice idea. Maybe someone with a fast internet connection can
download popular ebooks and tutorials on linux and compile a CD and

If somebody could generate a list of URI's, I'll burn a few CDs and either bring
them to the LUG or pass them on to somebody who is going if I can't make it.

Hi all,
       when we type "lspci"...
it shows all pci devices with slot name...
 bus(8-bits): device(5-bits) : function(3-bits)

to identify a PCI device....

here function mean...it will tell..whether the device
is single functional... or multi-functional....

So,
what is multi-functional device??

A device that has many end-point resources. 

For example, it can be a PCI card with two serial
ports and a parallel port.

One Day One Command :-
---------------------

alias - Create alias name for a command.

Summary: 

alias is Bash build-in command. This is very useful to create a simple
alias for a complex/long/frequent commands. Once alias created, you
can use alias to call the original command. This alias are deleted
after closing the shell session. For the next session, you have create
it again. So avoid this problem, you add it in your .bashrc file.

Example:

alias  -- Prints all alias commands

alias ls="ls -F --color=always" 
alias cls=clear 

alias ls -- Print the alias' original command

Read: man bash

Hi,

What your printer can and cannot do is defined in .ppd files, if you can
get the .ppd file for your printer and put it in /usr/share/cups/model,
then reconfigure the printer using this .ppd file and you should get all
the options your printer can support.

Your first stop should be the manufacturer's site, next
linuxprinting.org

Correct - quite often the distros are either free for download but not 
for redistribution, or much more expensive (like RHEL) - and with 
redistribution similarly prohibited.

So Ritchie Street software pirates are now diversifying into pirating 
linux distros as well?

you can 'define'  a function, yes.  But whats your  point?  alias is a
literal expansion.  its very much like a pre-processor operation.

alias foo="function bar() { echo hello world; }"

will only  'define' the function 'bar'  when you type  'foo'. Its just
that instead of  having to type of the entire  function, you typed out
'foo'. and the above example is slightly misleading, in a way, in that
if people try to type 'foo test message', they would get syntax errors
because it does literal expansion.

some examples:

$ alias intemp="cd /tmp; "
$ intemp ls
<output of ls>
$ pwd
/tmp

$ alias obfuscated="function myfunc() {"
$ obfuscated echo hello world; }; myfunc
hello world
$

Try writing a whole script within an alias... Somewhat useless, but could be 
useful also.

(please dont 'top-post').

Thats not  my point.  alias is a  literal expansion. For  example, you
cannot make your 'function' take arguments. For example if you want to
take a file as an argument to your alias and then cat that file and do
something...

cat <file> | ssh myhost "perl -e 'some code'"

this isn't  possible with a shell  alias. You *will* have  to define a
function.

Of course, you can do this:

alias x='function f { cat $1 |  ssh myhost "perl -e 'some code'"; };f'

But  whas the point?  you could  have pre-defined  'f' anyway  in your
bashrc.

As far as SuSE is concerned, you can copy, download
and redistribute the the CDs (pro and personal)
provided you don't charge for the software. One can
always do a SuSE FTP installation. 

When you buy SuSE personal and pro in the market (like
from compusa.com), you are not paying for the distro.
You are paying for the CDs/DVDs, manuals, tech support
etc.

K Shakthi

What RedHat, SuSE and Mandrake essentially sell is support. Please check 
this out from their respective sites. For example at the RedHat 
Enterprise Linux Support Options and Pricing page at 
http://www.redhat.com/software/rhel/purchase/index.html and  
http://www.redhat.com/support/service/sla/rhel3.html , the prices vary 
depending upon the extent and mode of support.Generally, those who 
prohibit redistribution of GPLed or other like free software may be 
prosecuted for copyright violations, and therefore, they would not and 
don't prohibit redistribution.
  
All these companies work hard to put together distros, write patches, 
and even make very substantial contributions. The LinuxForYou issue 
dated Nov, 2004, carried an interview with  founder of RedHat, Michael 
Tiemann, how he single handedly did the GNU C++ compiler, in just six 
months, working hard for 18 hours a day, 7 days a week and finally 
announced it to the mailing list. Purchasing support services directly 
from the company could help to pay developers and also increase the 
reach of free software.  The boxes usually ship with good quality manuals.

not to forget, much more efficient too...gets defined only once...and
writing lines of shell code in an alias sources it....sourcing is
different from writing a script in many ways....

I tried Ubuntu once.
And I can say that it's good for you if you fall in this category

* You love GNOME, not KDE (Kubuntu is for KDE fans)
* You have a broadband connection at home or the complete
	Sarge CD-set.
* Are Paranoid about keeping your Distro on the bleeding edge.

For the last point you can also try Gentoo :)

Ubuntu is just Debian, re-packaged with some pretty stuff and a good
Installer
With good hardware detection.I think it uses HAL for hardware detection.
It gives you a default-configured distro and then you can customise it
as you want.

The best thing about Ubuntu is the release cycles, the release cycles
are made
to co-incide with GNOME's, so each time a new GNOME revision happens,
you
can expect a Ubuntu release. They make sure that you get the latest
packages
within a 6 month span. This is a very good solution to the release
problems that
Currently plague Debian.

Also the staff on board Cannonical is some of the who's who of the
Linux-Desktop Community.

on Emacs Lisp.  Here is a document I have written from the notes I
made for that talk.  I completely forgot about this doc. until

Due to Ubuntu release cycle, I see a broadband connection is not at
all needed.  The user just get an Ubuntu CD each 6 months and upgrade
is current system with that.  Technicall this is possible with Debian
too, but Ubuntu does that in a clean way (fixed release cycles in sync
with Gnome).   Gnome users would love it.

> * Are Paranoid about keeping your Distro on the bleeding edge.

This is the main reason I switched to Ubuntu from debian.  I need the
*latest* development packages.  For example, gnome-python-extras is
(as of now) missing in debian/sid and unofficial sources.  That
necessitated me to 'make install' pygtk-2.5, gnome-python-2.9.x and so
..on (the slackware way).

btw, 'warty' in ubuntu is like 'sarge' in debian only that it is not
updated throught that 6 months time (except for security updates). 
'hoary' is like 'sid' in debian but much closer to current.  For
example, 'hoary' has gnome2.9 as of now!

The only problem I had with Gentoo is the 'compile time'. 
Re-compiling everytime a  support release of package (same version)
happens is not pleasing.  Known solutions (just a compromise) are
using distcc, catching build files or using binary packages (quite
outdated than debian sarge binary packages).   Over all,  IMO,
advantage of user-level compilation is less when compared to binary
packages.

Hi,

  I have Application1  on /home/app1/cgi-bin  &
         Application2  on /home/app2/cgi-bin

  I had Application1 being accessed by having the
ScriptAlias in httpd.conf as

ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/home/app1/cgi-bin/"

I access the application from my client as 

 http://<Ip.address.of.Server>/cgi-bin/app1.cgi

Like we have multiple path searchs in the PATH
environment variable 

PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

can we have a similar directive for the webserver , so
that I can specify the path of my second app and have
it accessed as 

http://<Ip.address.of.Server>/cgi-bin/app2.cgi

Thanks in advance for your help.

Regards,
Senthil

Message-ID: <20050107052921.77930.qmail@web41708.mail.yahoo.com>

I am having a squid proxy server and I am using SARG
to generate access report. I want to get a report of
SARG on daily basis, Since SARG will look for the
Squid access.log file only to generate report, I
planned for rotating the Squid's access.log on daily
basis, so that there will be individual logs for every
day. 

     I added the a script to execute sarg in
/etc/cron.daily/ and also the logrotate was there
already resent in this directory. And I will execute
the cron.daily at system boot time (since we will
shutdown the system daily). what I want is, I want the
sarg script to be run before the logrotate so that the
report for the previous day will be generated and the
log file will be rotated.
     I saw a 0anacron file in this dir which says
adding a 0 infront of the file will make this to
execute first before any other cron files. How can do
the same for sarg.

Yes, KDE users should try Kubuntu as mentioned earlier.

A small reminder, hoary (initially) was crippled .
Its no way similar to Sid, Sid(current) runs perfectly.

A *complete* Ubuntu Distro based on hoary is way too
Bleeding-edge.

Atleast it was broken initially when I tried it a month back.
Should've improved now :)

Overall, it's a good Distro.
Side Note: the Ubuntu-user mailing list is great for solving
technical issues, but it's a *high traffic* one.

It has more posts than LKML!! :O

Is this really true. Sometime back there were mails saying that after
Novell's aquistion Suse is no longer free for redistribution.

The CDs contain non-free (as in cost, as well as closed source code

Did you 'dist-upgrade' after choosing 'hoary' in /etc/apt/sources.list
before doing any single package installtion?  Otherwise, it would bail
out with errors for most packages.

ps: I too cannot assure anything as I am currently dist-upgrade'ing
hoary (about 450 mb to download) ;)

It depends on your distribution.  Read the appropriate manual (RPM, APT, ...)

Man pages:
For mandrake, see 'urpmi'
For redhat, fedora, see 'rpm'
For debian,ubuntu,.. see 'apt-get', 'sources.list'

Thanks for the correction.  If the CDs are known to contain non-free 
software/parts, the person who desires to redistribute and the end user 
as well needs to act according to the terms of its license.  Debian 
makes the task of redistribution easy with its classification of 
packages into free, non-free, contrib etc, but I am not sure how the 
others plan their distros.

Sequence number guessing is a more than 4..5 year old fixed vulnerablity.

Please google for terms like "ingress filtering" and uRPF, and also see RFCs
2827 and 3704.

(1)Set  logfile_rotate  in your  squid.conf  then, create
FILE:  /etc/cron.daily/sarg
-----------------------

#!/bin/bash
 
#Get yesterday date
YESTERDAY=$(date --date "1 day ago" +%d/%m/%Y)
 
/path/to/sarg -o /DOCUMENTROOT/TO/REPORT/daily -d $YESTERDAY > /dev/null 2>&1

/path/to/squid -k rotate  
 
exit 0
-----------------

(2) Move squid logrotate config file from /etc/logrotate.d/squid  to /somewhere/

FILE:  /etc/cron.daily/sarg
-----------------------

#!/bin/bash
 
#Get yesterday date
YESTERDAY=$(date --date "1 day ago" +%d/%m/%Y)
 
/path/to/sarg -o /DOCUMENTROOT/TO/REPORT/daily -d $YESTERDAY > /dev/null 2>&1

/path/to/logrotate  /somewhere/squid

Hi,

  When it comes to managing project, which tool you guys prefer and is
widely used among all open source lovers.

  I can think about few:

Configuration Management - CVS, Subversion
Bugzilla - Bug Tracker, PHPBugTracker
Project Management - DotProject??
Anything you want to add to this list?

My conclusions: Hoary is very unstable than debian/sid.  Sid users
would find common breakages in Hoary.  It is easily perceivable from
facts like hoary has gnome2.9 packages, etc ..--after the first
dist-upgrade I had to remove some my gnome settings and gconf stuff to
get it work.  But I still use it :-D

Emacs, Quanta and Kdevelop to integrate it all.

Which one depends on what kind of project. That should be pretty 
obvious... :-)

BTW, it's Version Control, not Config. Management. Add Perforce to that list.

Good to see that the Hoary Hedgehog is runnable.
Congratulations to yopu on that.

Last time when I tried it out, it was broken,
could'nt even boot off it.

Well I guess Sid is a much better solution to those
"unstable" people.

Thanks for the presentation, Toufeeq. It was very
informative. 

We have made a very good start, and this _will_
continue, every week. 

Hariram has confirmed the shell scripting tutorial
session for January 15, 2005 (Saturday, IIT-M). I
shall release the poster soon, so that it can be
circulated in colleges/bulletin boards/forums/mailing
lists.

Between lecture series, we can have talks on specific
topics/topics of interest. I am planning to start off
with a talk on "Careers with GNU/Linux". We can

I dont think its timeout. Should be something on the server side.,
or maybe PuTTY is crashing.

Try this:

#!/bin/bash
ping -c 1 www.yahoo.com 1>/dev/null
return=`echo $?`
if [ $return -eq 0 ]; then     #Success
  echo "0" >> /tmp/log.file

  echo "1" >> /tmp/log.file

By 'load  balancer' are you talking  about a setup  where multiple web
servers are serving  traffic? How do you handle  sessions?  Would like
to hear  how your setup is  (hoping its a one-man  setup/solution :) )
and how its performance is.

Comments sent by Professor Nagarjuna, Chairman, FSF (Free Software Foundation), India on 
the subject  `HRD for FOSS Capable IT Professionals.'

1. What are the focus areas that need to be addressed  by Govt. at  national & 
international levels?

Localization: 
Most urgent focus area should be to identify,  encourage and support the already ongoing 
groups that are  striving to localize (private IT solutions in Indian  languages) the 
GNU/Linux operating system.  How urgent this is becomes clear if we take into account the 
fact that  currently only 4% people (based on the approximate english  literacy) are 
capable of using computers, while our country  has about 65% literacy.  So far IT is 
enabling only the upper  strata of the country.  If we want our people to participate  in 
this information age, making content available to Indian  languages should be a top 
priority.  In this regard, another  serious matter: most of the already localized and 
digitized  content in Indian languages is done in an unethical and  inappropriate way, 
because the documents are encoded in  proprietary standards (both at the level of font and 
data  encoding).  This is serious becomes clear if we know that  this is not allowed in 
any other country except in India.  Govt. must enforce all the industries who are 
presently in  this market (including Govt's CDAC) to develop filters to covert all such 
documents in ISCII, TISCI and Unicode  formats. (please see below our proposals on 
Encoding policy)  

Conversion of schools to FOSS:  
We should work towards the  target of 100% FOSS use in schools 5 years from now, and  
before 2020.  Starting now, we shouldn't install any new  machines in schools/colleges and 
public institutions with  non-free software.  This will eventually solve not only HRD  
related issues for FOSS but also to nurture a good ethos  within the learning institutes 
that shape future societies.  

Content Development: 
While this might seem not a related  issue of FOSS, but FOSS practiced and demonstrated a 
unique  model where people can generate and maintain content that  they require on their 
own if they follow the wikipedia model  (http://www.wikipedia.org) and other such 
community portals.  We should not only create a mirror of sites like wikipedia in  our 
country, but also should make efforts to create and  translate the existing public content 
in Indian languages.  This will also encourage a large number of Indians to  contribute in 
such portals worldwide.  

Mirrors of Free Software:  
Indian mirrors (repositories that  keep upto date versions of the software developed)  must 
be  created and located within the country for faster and  sustained access. 

Internet: 
Internet is the nurturing media of swatantra  software.  It is difficult to visualize the 
success of free  software without Internet.  Providing faster and economical  access to 
this facility particularly for public institutions  will help support and sustain the 
movement further.  Though  not related to FOSS directly, we must have the network work  
within the country independent of the international backbone.  Seriousness of this becomes 
clearer if we look at the fact  that when our up front ISP's are disconnected to the 
international backbone, two people within a city in India may  not be able to communicate 
with each other despite the fact  that they are completely wired.  This could be due to 
the  non-availability of root DNS servers, and not a very clean routing of packets within 
the country.]  Not having such an  independent network may cause serious problems in case 
of  international pressures.  Having such a facility is crucial  for a good bargaining 
power of a developing nation.  China, I  was told, has such a network which works 
independent of the  international backbone.

At the international level we should protect our freedom in  matters related to imposing 
software patents. The current  stand by India on this very important issue should be held  
strongly and no modification is required.  We should  withstand and stand on our feet and 
defend our independence  in this matter without yeilding to the pressures of the so  
called developed countries and bigger financial powers to  enforce software patents in our 
country too. 
  

2. What policies / guidelines should be evolved to create a strong HRD  in FOSS in India?

Digital Encoding: 
A very important issue is to drive industry  and all govt and other      public bodies to 
encode all their  documents in open standards (non-proprietary).  E.g.,
exchanging and storing documents in MS Word should not be  allowed, since these documents 
being binary not only  propogate viruses with them making them vulnerable, but since  the 
encoding method is not a standard and the companies  change them in every next version 
merely (without any  technical reason) to keep their users locked and continue to  use 
their upgraded software.  If we encourage such usage,  then govt. is actually supporting a 
monopoly practice to  flourish within the country. Alternatively, the document  encodings 
be done in text, html, xml, pdf, rtf, in that order  of preference.  A similar policy for 
encoding spreadsheets,  databases, audio, video etc.  All digital encodings of public  
documents as a policy cannot be done in propreitary  standards.  FSF India wishes that we 
work towards enforcing  this by bringing in other stakeholders and confederations  like 
NASSCOM, FICCI, CII, MAIT etc should be alerted to take  up this issue in the national 
interest.  This will encourage  good business ethos within the industry.  We wish that 
Govt.  take this initiative and lead.  FSF India will provide any  help to Govt. in this 
regard in arriving at a policy document.

Curriculum: 
Second major issue for human resource development  within the country is to plan in a major 
way to restructure  the technical curriculum of schools and colleges within the  country.  
What is happening now is no less than a crime:  e.g., existence of brand names within the 
curriculum/syllabi  at all levels (schools, colleges and  universities).  This is  a 
direct endorsement of a particular company and a specific  application.  This is a serious 
issue and should be  considered very urgent.  We need to alert and bring together  the 
policy makers of technical education immediately and ask  them to remove all mentions of 
brand names in the  syllabi. For example, eliminate Oracle and replace it by  RDBMS, 
eliminate Exell and replace it by spreadsheet etc.  This kind of secular syllabi will 
provide enough freedom also  to the instructors to use what is available.  When we went to  
schools and organizations to promote free software we were astonished to find such glaring 
omissions.  We request that  Govt. must look in to this matter.  Keeping in mind that  
schools and colleges are the places where the trained  technical persons are getting 
generated, it is here that we  need to concentrate to create a secular technical 
curriculum.  Please keep in mind that a large number or private IT  training colleges are 
directly funded by major software  companies to provide education only in a specific 
technology.  If technical training is entirely left to private interests  bigger companies 
will dictate what is good for the country and  not the Govt.  We should also monitor this 
area also, since  many people opt for getting trained in such institutes.
  
Swatantra Software Consortium: 
By inviting all the stake  holders and confederations a consortium (similar to the W3C)  
should be formed to make informed decisions on technical and  policy issues related to 
software and technical matters.  

Standards to be followed by Websites:  
Access to content  available on the Internet depends on the delivery method  followed by 
the content publishers.  Most content publishers  unknowingly  support some specific 
encodings again  proprietary, which will enforce the users to use a particular  
technology, again promoting certain business interests. 
  
A much bigger and broader issue is to drive towards a policy  where no technology is 
allowed to be distributed (marketed)  in a proprietary mode of delivery.  Just as we seek 
our  automobiles come with nuts and bolts we should demand that  every software that is 
marketed must carry the source code  along with the right to modify and distribute the 
software.  This is going to encourage a lot of innovation, as is already  evident within 
the FOSS world, within the country.  This is  the best way to achieve the self-reliance 
enshrined in our  Constitution, and is the main focus of the 2020 vision of our  Honarable 
President Kalam.  Let people participate in shaping  the technology of our society.

Law mandating use of Free and Open Software and Standards in public  affairs is necessary  
to enable wider and stronger  use and adoption  of FOSS. Just as the GNU Manifesto, and 
the GPL together laid a firm  foundation for growth of free software, a clear statement of 
objects  and reasons for using  FOSS for Computerisation, with enunciation of  it as 
legislation  alone will enable use, adoption  and evolution of  workable  solutions.   A   
'Computerisation  [FOSS]  Act'  may  help  establishing public  networks to handle  
routine transactions, using  FOSS, with transparency at every level, for productivity and 
growth.  Without this, there would be  wastage of resources resulting in poor  
implementations not usable or workable.

 It is also necessary to  have laws that compel hardware and software  manufacturers to 
disclose technical specifications and details about  their   products   to  buyers,   to   
enable  interoperability   and  portability.  For example, new AGP  cards like NVIDIA are 
getting far  more complex than the CPU,  and it may become increasingly difficult  to  
reverse engineer  such  complex hardware  to  make such  devices  accessible  to  free 
software.   Selective  disclosures to  non-free  software entities  alone promote 
monopolies,  and therefore harmful.  Manufacturers should disclose full information about 
their products,  which   will   also  enable   independent   checking,  testing   and  
verification of product integrity and security.

All research  projects funded by the  state should be  made free and  open to the public.  
FSF  India has already elaborated the necessity  for this in its recent memorandum 
addressed to CSIR.

Software Patents Policy to be arrived at as mentioned in  response to the first point.

Keep reverse engineering legal. This is required till all the  technology is not free.

India should reject US pressure to prohibit free software to  play a DVD, etc.

Any attempt by other bodies that try to create policies that  would limit what can the FOSS 
community can do should be  resisted.  One way is to play an active role in WIPO to block  
any proposed treaties that would limit what people are  allowed to do with FOSS.  For 
instance, the proposed WIPO  Broadcast Treaty would do this.


3. Any other suggestions on the subject  `HRD for FOSS capable IT  Professionals'.

If the above mentioned basic issues are addressed most of the ground work for creating FOSS 
professionals get created.

Contests, Events, Festivals and awareness camps may be organized to enthuse the community 
to develop Swatantra software solutions.  FSF India will help organizations that come 
forward to organize such events.  Special projects for developing Swatantra software may 
be given to qualified professionals to develop the required software.

After an address resolution, the client is going to be connecting

Thats not my  point.  The application is where  it matters.  The first
run, The user  might get a session cookie from  one machine but during
the next 'click' it might go  to a different front-end. In large scale
solutions  data replication and  clustering is  a solution.   In small
scale, I  can only think  of having custom session  handling functions
that  write to,  say,  NFS mounted  directories  or write  to a  MySQL
DB). So wondering how these guys might have set this up.

You can use a package manager like yum for rpm or apt for
debian/fedora (apt4rpm works for rpm's as well).....these programs
work with repositories - you can make a directory as a
repository....even for rpm's I would suggest apt, though it is not
shipped by default - it is quite powerful and extensible - and has
nice gui frontends like synaptic (unlike yum).

it moves on...

Hi all,
       ioremep() is a function, which maps physical
address to virtual address(kernel space)
my doubt is:
   why we should map physical address to
virtual-address?

   we can read and write to physical address only know
directly....

Because kernel is running in virtual address space.
All physical addresses are to be mapped to its address
space.

Also remember to use readl/b/w, writel/b/w functions
with ioremapped addresses.

Latest package versions, additional tools, kernel 2.6, the differences
are many. Any single computer user would want to go for FC3 over Red
Hat, I guess.

Technically, its  the shell that  interprets the `cat nums`  first and

supplied the -n argument here or not.

Hi,

I just screwed up my mouse (left button is not at all working).  Can
you suggest a window manager where almost all commands can be
performed by keyboard?  I could think of IceWM now.  Also how do you
think one browses the web without a mouse?

Do not tell me to go back to Ctrl+Alt+F1

Thanks for the correction. The '-n' option don't add the new line char
at the end of the output string.

Yes, I know .. but the speed is very low.  Controlled acceleration
will be useful (concentrate for a few seconds on how we move our
mouse).

I think a research is needed on "using keyboard in place of mouse" ;)

Everyone is welcome to participate in this session.  However, please note
that

0) there is only limited seating available (we should be able to easily
accommodate 30-40 people)
1) on the other hand, 13th. is a working day, so we're not sure how many
people will actually turn up

To help us plan the logistics appropriately, I would appreciate it if
interested persons confirmed their participation ASAP.  I believe
there is going to be a formal ILUG-C `delegation' at the meeting.  In
addition, we would especially welcome participation of people from
industry, academia and research who are actively using, developing or
promoting Free Software in their work.  This meeting is meant to be a 
kind of forum for Govt. to learn about their experiences, to learn about
their needs, and what Govt. can do to fulfil those needs in the long
term.  Specifically, the focus will be on the initiatives Govt. can take
to promote Free Software in the education and human resources sectors.
Those who will not be able to attend but who have something to say on
this issue may send me thier notes, so that they can be circulated among the
representatives from the GoI.

More details will be posted on this thread, as and when they become
available. HAND.

Later,

Anand.

Hello all,

use the filters used in OpenOffice.org for conversion. I would like to
know whether there would be any isues in using the OpenOffice.org

I have no big expecations. It is going to be designed for purely

Played around with gzip, gcc.
Wana meet the person who created these software gizmos? 
This event is for you then. Vellore Institute of Technology is 
organizing
a symposium on Free and Open Source software technologies titled
Swatantra(6th - 7th Feb, 05). 

Founder of GNU and the man responsible for coining the term Free 
Software,
Richard M Stallman will be there to deliver the keynote address of the
symposium and to answer all the questions that you have always wanted 
to
ask about these amazingly simply yet inherently complex programs. 

The event will also feature various competitions to kindle your nack 
for
Linux tweaking and tuning such as:- 

LINSTALL-- The Linux installation challenge.
Anaconda !! YaSt !! familiar with all these name? Have been installing 
on
your system for a long time and you find it fun?? making the X server 
run??
configuring the boot loader?? ..YES??..One event where apply all your
skills which you developed over the years by trying to install 
GNU/Linux on
your system. 

WEBMINISTER-- The Apache web server Challenge
Love Apache because of the customizability it offers while deploying 
your
website? Love fiddling with httpd.conf and think you are best at it? 
This
is one event to prove yourself! Come and demonstrate that your are the 
best
at the best web server that there is and ever was..... 

CORE WARS-- Challenge the memory
This event will feature an old game called core wars which involves
destroying your opponents programs by overwriting the memory in which 
this
program is stored. It will kindle the nerves of memory geeks with 
pointers
and direct memory references expertise being the norm. 

Watch out for cool demonstrations on MONO, Linux Cluster, Linux from
scratch and much more....

I would go in for enlightenment - well, even with a working mouse, I use it...
Has an excellent keybinding system - all wm actions and any arbitrary
shell command can be executed - there's a functional gui called
e16keyedit for this too - add `essh', the enlightenment wm shell to
this - you can go to desktop 1, launch emacs, kill any window matching
the title regexp '.*g?vim.*' ( ;) ), goto area (2,3), restore any
minimized windows, asynchronously wait for emacs to finish loading and
notify you with music of your choice - all when you press
Ctrl+Alt+G...Especially if you are a confiuguration maniac (like
making windows of one particular class focus on clicking...well, if u
have a working mouse...) and love  eye candy (like a translucent image
of the window when moving it) - the E is the way to go.

One more suggestion - if your left button isn't working - may be you
could use the X config to swap your buttons - we use the left button
more than the right, right ?

it moves on...

I am currently using my right-mouse-button as left-button and for
right clicking I use the shift-numlock trick.

btw, no more hardware addition/upgrades planned for my PC .. will buy

Yeah, and if the guy's in college - even engineering college, he really 
should spell better than this, even if english classes are the best time 
to bunk college and go watch a movie.

Even skript kiddie english isn't as badly spelled and overexcited as 
this .. and fwiw I prefer keeping a stable system and updating it rather 
than repeating the "install stage" .. that's linux for you.  It is not 
windows where you have to keep booting in with the CD, trashing your 
install and reinstalling it.

Yes we have 6 webservers, 2 mysql db servers, 1 mail server running
qmail & 1 file server. we are using unison for site syncronisation and
real time db replication with mysql 4.1.8. Also the script which i
took for changing the values 0 & 1 is read by a php code in which we
have a condition for connection mysql db server "mysql_connect" , if
it reads value 0 it will connect the master db server and if it gets
value 1 it will connect slave server.

Even if you use a gui, gmail has an excellent keyboard interface that 
you can use.

And again - go buy a mouse, it is quite cheap.

Not all can be done with those keyboard shortcuts.  For example,
navigating to labels is not possible without mouse.

if that is the case, I will buy a wireless keboard/mouse.

That is a very inefficient way to try and loadbalance mysql.  Instead, 
take a look at http://sqlrelay.sourceforge.net/

Gmail does not use real links (<a href...).  They are text with
javascript actions, see for yourself.

Why not? 

Use ioremap() for IO-mapped and use inb(), outb()
functions.

Did you try it without remapping? Oops ... you will
get that. Good way to learn oops debugging!

Firefox has a lot of keyboard shortcuts and I hardly
use my touchpad :)

Keyboard shortcuts:
http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/keyboard

In Gnome, if you do Alt+F1 you can get the whole menu,
I believe. Each desktop environment/window manager has
its own shortcut keys, which you can configure to your
needs.

Hi,

My thoughts below:

You also want school/college students to attend
workshops/lectures. Schedule your events in such a way
that you can avoid timing conflicts.

I will be happy to render lectures, attend to
question-answer sessions (Feb 19, 20 - weekends).
 
> &#61623; Public 
> o Demo

I would encourage MIT students to take this as an
opportunity to learn something _new_ and demo the
same. 
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/categories.html

> o Application Project Demonstration

Conduct a three-four member programming contest. Can
be multiple problems to be solved in a stipulated time
or give it as a single project. 

> o Web page Design using Free Software Technology

Should be interesting. Some useful tools here for web
designers:
http://www.linuxforum.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=53452

> o Paper Presentation  /* Please suggest topics */
> o Quiz
> o Ad. Design Contest
> o Hacking /* Please Suggest */

You can setup servers and invite students to _hack_
into the system. No script kiddies! 
But, participants will have to be strong in
assembly/perl/C. 

> o Game Zone

UT!
 
> Workshops & Lecture Topics
> &#61623; Kernel Programming

You are targeting a larger audience. Not sure how many
will be interested in it. Requires strong
fundamentals.

> &#61623; GNU Programming tools

Should be useful.

> &#61623; Advanced  Linux Programming

Same as kernel programming.

> &#61623; Networking in Linux

Show as many demos as possible.

Your strength is the number of students and computers.
I suggest you keep as many displays/demos/stalls as
possible, apart from the events. WYSIWYG - you can
convey a lot of info with eye-catching displays.

Regards,

K Shakthi

Hi Sridhar,

Just go to Ritchie Street and get a cheap PS/2
mouse for as low as Rs 80. Unbelievably, they
do work for quite some time(in months).

BTW, my instinct in such cases would be to unscrew
the shell and verify if it could be fixed with a
few tweaks.

Speaking of laptops, any suggestions regarding the
same.

I heard Thinkpads are the best for Linux and Vaio's
the worst.
This is in terms of H/W support.

What does the ILUGC community prefer.. ?

That wont help failover which is what he wants to implement I guess.
It is basically overkill if all he has are two or three mysql servers - 
better use them as a single cluster and cache mysql connections, using 
sqlrelay or other mysql clustering app.

If you want to measure that the best way to go is hacking in the real 
sense of the word .. has anybody heard of / played "corewars"?

Powerbook g4 is cool, but the cost is high and dunno much the linux support.

I have an acer travelmate 290 series (292 FxCi) that I rather like.

Centrino laptop (ipw2200.sourceforge.net for the centrino drivers), intel
motherboard + video card, ac97 sound card with rather cheesy speakers, an
internal modem that linmodems.org seems to detect just fine, and rtl8139 /
realtek ethernet card.

Slackware 10 worked just fine almost out of the box - had to download and
compile the ipw2200 driver for 2.6.x though (this box now runs 2.6.10 just
great).

Two other things you need - especially with 2.6 and intel's centrino speedstep
- are:

1. cpufreqd - http://cpufreqd.sourceforge.net
2. laptop-mode-tools to take advantage of the 2.6 laptop mode -
   http://www.xs4all.nl/~bsamwel/laptop_mode/tools/

FC3, Sarge etc should also install just fine on this guy .. and best of all, it
is lightweight, sleek aluminium colored, and ships with RH7.3 preinstalled that
you can format without worrying that your laptop's cost includes the cost of a
licensed windows XP that you're going to format and install linux on top of it.

I'd recommend Thinkpad anyday, and would suggest to best avoid notebooks
from the Asian market if you are looking for sturdy-build coupled with
excellent Linux support (esp. the cheap ones from Fujitsu, Jaguar,
Sharp, Toshiba and Sony). But then again, that's just my personal
opinion. Even Dell laptops are way better. Owning a Powerbook is like
owning a Mercedes (and not many would want Linux on that box).

thinkpads are good - except for that @$^$^%& trackball device in the 
middle of the keyboard that they pass off as a mouse.

the more expensive thinkpads have touchpads, though - but they're 
considerably more expensive

there's a linux on laptops site that has detailed howtos on installing 
various distros on laptops .. some of these are outdated, others are 
less detailed and say stuff like "i dont use this so i didnt try it" etc 
.. but you should be able to work stuff out.

i've been using this acer for a while now and it is pretty good.

I find a lot of people complain about the trackpoint device... But
strangely, I'm used to it so well that I couldn't easily adjust myself
to touchpads when I get my hands on a different notebook ;-). But then,
yes... vast majority of people are more comfortable with touchpads
(newer models of thinkpads have them too).

> i've been using this acer for a while now and it is pretty good.

I've heard good reviews about acer too (though never got my hands on one
as yet). There's a rumour that a couple of IBM thinkpad models are being
manufactured (outsourced) at Acer itself... know not how far thats true,
yet someone told me that one of his "outsourced" IBM thinkpad had issues
with Linux (XFree86 rather) detecting the video chipset an year back.

There are these new notebooks that I've come across in this month's
PCQuest magazine - Ingram Micro, Edge, Connoi and Benq.
Anyone tried their luck getting Linux to work on these models ? Any
comments about their hardware support on Linux ?

Its a trackpoint, not a trackball. It is very useful
and convenient when you type fast and use it to move
the mouse pointer.

You can execute a php file by calling the php binary ( <prefix
dir>/bin/php) with the file name as an argument. But i am yet to find
out how to pass values (GET or POST) to generate dynamic pages.....

waiting to know more about load balancing and clustering...

AFAIK., pdf is like a image file, rendered from a source
document. There is a tool called pdf2text but that'll create plain
text. The formatting would be lost.

Hi,

You'll need the pdf-utils package.
It contains utilities to convert between pdf to other formats.
One of the formats is rtf, from which you can build a Word Doc in OO
Writer.

Google around..

Yeah.
There's something magical about the Thinkpad + Linux combo.
It seems to go so well.

In all the Linux talks I've attended , the speakers have had 
Linux + Thinkpad's.
Maybe they have the $$ to spend on one, or maybe its
The choice of the community.

Yet to see a Acer, so srs why not have a Linux talk :)

Have this  in your prompt  or write a  gdesklets applet that  does the
above and stick it in your desktop.

Also  try 'athcool'[1],  but  be warned  that  it might  not work  for
you. It works for me (Athlon XP  2600+ / VIA KM800A). I *used* to hear
an  annoying  noise  from  my  on-board sound  card  when  using  this
software, but thats reduced a lot after I put a PCI SBLive 5.1 in.

The very first  (or second or third) ILUGC meet  I attended had Asokan
demoing Debian "potato" (it was 'frozen' back then) on his Dell laptop
that he lovingly called "DellBian".  Everything worked out of the box.
Sound, Graphics  (on a  large 1280x1024 display  running windowmaker),
Network.

Of  course, "out  of  the box"  is a  term  that continues  to take  a
different meaning  during each  era.  :) One  had to type  'lspci' and
'modprobe' the  appropriate modules and almost always  it was preceded
by  a kernel  compile.   and  often there  were  these huge  "cultural
divides" between various distros.  People would complain that there is
no pppconfig in redhat or a sndconfig in debian and such.

sorry - forgot to cc the list

55k or so as far as I remember, 6 months back.

If you want something cheaper I have a compaq presario - 1 1/2 yrs old - 
that currently runs WinXP (though a sarge / slackware etc install soon 
ought to remedy that condition .. compaqs are pretty good at linux 
support).  Anybody want to buy it please email me offlist.

RTF will open in just about every word processor around - openoffice, ms

No need for further conversion once you have an RTF doc

gkrellm rocks....perhaps one app I can go on talking abt like I did
for enlightenment...occupies one full column of my desktop with
everything from an alsa frequency spectrum to monitoring cpu
usage...sensors support is excellent - works with ACPI, lm_sensors,
hddtemp (may be others too..)...make sure you run sensors_detect
(comes with lm_sensors) as root - quite comprehensive and interactive
- if you have fedora, it will generate the config file as well...you
will just have to ensure that the lm_sensors service is running (check
with system-config-services or peek into /etc/rc?.d/)

it moves on...

PS: Sorry if this mail comes up in double...I got a mail delivery

Message-ID: <557E17BE74D22143B7BE70EB60E33E99150A3294@shlmsg01.ad.infosys.com>

Hello all,

I've been having this doubt for a long time and I wanted to know what
the community feels about this.

During Kernel Compilation , we can either build modules or have the
feature compiled into the kernel.

I personally prefer having a monolithic kernel with all the features
compiled in.

I use *no modules*, I have a minimal configuration with just the bare
necesseties.
Ex: I don't have support for parallel port etc

I feel this speeds up the boot time by a few seconds.

Is this the right way to go about it, or would I be better off 
Having a modular kernel ?

Regards,
Toufeeq Hussain

No can do, sorry. My wife will be giving birth to our first kid sometime

Anytime over this weekend say - some of you feel free to drop by my 
place in adyar and we can talk about the laptop .. though it is nothing 
special.

Yday, I gone thru bash manual to get more info abt the command
substitution.

<snip>
Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the
command itself.  Command substitution occurs when a command is
enclosed as follows:

     $(COMMAND) or `COMMAND`

Bash performs the expansion by executing COMMAND and replacing the
command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any
trailing newlines deleted.  Embedded newlines are not deleted, but
they may be removed during word splitting.  The command substitution
`$(cat FILE)' can be replaced by the equivalent but faster `$(<
FILE)'.

Dell rocks with debian. It was 1400 x 1050 BTW - a rather unique Dell

These days me and my powerbook have come to terms. I just wish the damn

I think it doesn't matter all  that much. But speeding up things a lot
more is  to tune up your  startup services.  Things like  "Do I really
need a dictd starting up?". "Do  I really need xdm trying to see which
is the dm and then giving it up to gdm?"

exactly. The following helps demonstrate:

~ $ cat txt/foo.txt 
the quick brown
 fox jumped
 over the
 lazy dog
~ $ echo $(<txt/foo.txt)
the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
~ $ echo `cat txt/foo.txt`
the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
~ $ echo -n `cat txt/foo.txt `
the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog~ $ 

Note, in  the last  command with  'echo -n', how  the prompt  ended up
sticking close to the output. because  echo -n didn't add a newline in
the end.

No, Module support is there.
Currently I'm using the CPU Freq stuff as modules.

Yes I've removed gdm and the other unnecessary stuff .

To change the font in the Terminal :

In the Terminal application, from the Font menu, select Show Fonts (OS
X 10.2.x and later) or Font Panel... .
 
In the Font window, select the family, typeface, and size you want to
use. For some families, you may also change the character width and
height.
 
To make your changes the default setting, click the Save This Setting
As My Default Font button.

Linux on the Desktop & OS X on the move :)

Quick language recommendation : since you're allergic to $var format
in Perl/PHP I heartily recommned Ruby. Complete OO... and get the

I guess it would depend on the system and what you
intend to use the system for. 

If you are working on cutting-edge and
development/testing, then you will require modular
support.

If you are an end-user who simply want to use the
system, with quick boots, performance, then you might
as well have all the  modules compiled in, after
installing/configuring your hardware.

Message-ID: <1105430328.12083.104.camel@mazda>

Hi all, 

Kernel maintains a structure that can be operate by READ/WRITE
operations by user application.

For eg : SET1[5] = {10, 11,12,13,14,}
         SET2[5] = { 0, 1,  2, 3, 4}

         GET1[5] = {21, 22, 23, 24, 25};
         GET2[5] = {0,  1, 2, 3, 4};

1)User will pass any of the GET2 array to get the values on the
structure.(device_read)
2)user will pass any of the SET2 array to set the values on the
structure.( device_write)

I am looking for a mechanism as to how to store these GET1 and SET1 values in kernel modules.
Is there any standard structure that can used? kindly shoot your
reference!

Thanks
Raja Mallik

The webserver will ping the master mysql database every 10 or 15
seconds and will connect to the database whose value the ping results
it gets from the script.

This has solved our fail-over problem !! also we are not using any
kind of failover supporting app !!

Hi all,

	We are happy to announce the following event, that is to take place on
the 17th of January, in Kongu Engineering College.

	Seminar on GNU/Linux

Agenda - The seminar will concentrate on career issues, driver
programming, Linux installation. We also plan to screen The Code.

	We would like to thank 

	Mr. Shakthi Kannan 

for accepting our request to be the guest for the day and also take the
seminars.

	There were also other volunteers who were willing to come. But due to
other problems like conflicting dates, they were unable to make it for
this event. I'm sure they will be willing to come down here and share
their experience some other time when they are available.

	Thanks again.

Regards,
Arvind Kalyan

I have a Wipro LittleGenius CP 15, which has got almost the same
features. Cost me 66k in India. This was in Aug 2004.
--------------------------------------------
Features that worked "out of the box" (not even lspci/modprobe stuff)
with ubuntu warty.

ipw2100, cpufreq, AC'97 sound, 855GM graphics, synaptic touchpad
--------------------------------------------
Things I had to fiddle with to get it to work:

National Semiconductor based irda controller (nsc-ircc)

--------------------------------------------
Things I have not tested: firewire port
--------------------------------------------

Took me less than an hour to get the whole setup working. When I had
gentoo, I had to emerge packages and play with the ipw2100
firmware/driver a bit and I had to configure irda manually then too.

I'm satisfied with this laptop.

arv

yeah these are out of the box (except that slak doesnt ship with ipw 
drivers - these are slated to get integrated into the main kernel very 
soon ...)

Will it be only 5 elements? What type are these
elements? Will the size of the array grow? Are the
values a constant? What is the scope of the structure?

distros use modules as they need to cater a wide range of hardware -
it just isn't possible to compile in everything...for a custom
installation though, I guess compiling in things is better - faster,
saves some space required for the module as well (that's a microscopic
amt though...) - come on, there is no point in having a reiserfs
module with reiserfs on your hard disk. it is anyway needed right from
bootup to shutdown - I generally have modules for those which I may
not use that frequently, or for those which I may not need now, but
may require it some time in the future - in fact, even for the second
case, it isn't that difficult to do a recompile anyway...

it moves on...

You can use ioctl command to communicate with your
driver. 

User-space (application):
int ioctl(int fd, int cmd, ...);

Kernel-space (driver):
int (*ioctl) (struct inode *inode, struct file *filp,
         unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);

Since you want to get only one value, you can use:

__put_user(datum, ptr)

Check this link:

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0501120312090.12706@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,

I have an user account in a remote linux
server. I want to run a script once in 45 mins.
For this, I dont want to put in the login script
or write a program which runs continuously(or sleeps)
and executes the script once in 45 mins.

I dont have access(rights) to put in "crontab".
Also, I dont want to use "at" command because I dont want
to login and execute the script. But the server will be
running continuously.

Is there any way to do the above?.

OR

Is there any way to automatically telnet to a linux
server(with username and passwd) and executes the script
(put in login script) and logouts automatically.

I have heard of automated ftping, but not automated
telnetting.. any idea(s)?

Thaks and regards,
carti

Kernel module maintains a structure that can be operate by READ/WRITE
operations by user application.

For eg : SETTINGS[5] = {10, 11,12,13,14,}
         

User will defined IOCTLs for this map is defined as:

For write to device: ( Pass an index number and value to write)

1) IOCTL_SET1_MSG
2) IOCTL_SET2_MSG
3) IOCTL_SET3_MSG
4) IOCTL_SET4_MSG
5) IOCTL_SET5_MSG

And for reading from device: ( Pass an index number and get the value
set for the device)

1) IOCTL_GET1_MSG
2) IOCTL_GET2_MSG
3) IOCTL_GET3_MSG
4) IOCTL_GET4_MSG
5) IOCTL_GET5_MSG

I have defined 

static int Settings[5]={10, 12, 13, 14, 15}

When I call this in device_ioctl() in kernel module , I define all IOCTL
defined above in a switch(cmd_num) 

what I want to do is for 

case IOCTL_SET1_MSG:
     
        { 

          Here I want to set the global settings as defined above:
Settings[5] array.

}

I have IOCTL defined as:

#defined IOCTL_SET1_MSG --IOR( _IOR(DEVICE_MAJOR_NUM, 0, char *) 


When the user application calls with IOCTL_SET1_MSG, its passes a number
0 to the node, kernel should set 1st value of Settings[5]={10. 11, 12,
13, 14} i.e 10, and 11 for 1 and so on..

I am little stuck here.. 

Thanks
Raja

*ugh*  telnet? anyway,  be it  telnet or  ssh, you  can use  an expect
script to do it. search for  'expect script ssh' and you will find out
how to do it. Put the script in a cron job on your local box.

Or even plain ssh like this in your local crontab:

10 * * * * ssh remote.host 'command here'

With the  above you could have  a 'passphraseless' ssh  key. But thats
not a good  thing to do. If you  dont care, you can. Or if  you give a

Put a crontab in your desktop linux box which ssh's to the remote 
machine once every 45 minutes and executes the script there .. you can

Cat will conCATenate the FILE(s) / STDIN to STDOUT. 

Examples:

$ cat MyFile  -- Dump the file to STDOUT

$ cat File1 File2 File3 -- Dump File1, File2  & File3

$ cat -b File -- Print the File with Number for Non blank lines

$ cat -s File -- Squeeze multiple blank lines to single.

$ cat -A File -- Show the Non-Printable Chars also

Hi,

If your own machine runs 24x7 to run the remote script
every hour then that's fine. In case you don't have
such a setup there's another idea (no guarantees though).

Does the remote machine run a web server?
If so, you can host a cgi script that does all your stuff.
Then signup for some *free* site status probing service like
http://www.siteprobe.com/ to pull your cgi script every hour.

[It looks like siteprobe.com will only check your url every
1 hour and you will have to pay if you want to check more
often. You can find similar services if you search.]

Kumaraguru

Subject: [Ilugc] USB modem driver
Message-ID: <20050112142602.1B26E1DB261@www.ae.iitm.ac.in>

 

 

 

Hello


I am new to the linux world. and I have installed "Ubuntu Linux" in my
system. I use Airtel to connect to my broadband connection. It comes to me
with a USB modem (TeraGate Inc). I downloaded a ppp0e modem driver from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/zyxel630-11 The driver installed properly
and I configured the driver. I started the application.. But its says
connection Error Input/Output error. I think I may have got my settings
wrong. If anybody uses the same configuration. Please help me.

 

I got some information from an earlier post of ilugc at
http://www.aero.iitm.ernet.in/pipermail/ilugc/2004-November/013739.html 

 

Please Help me

Hi,

> cgi!? Like you want to make it easier to the expl0iter?

Follow the precautions you would normally have to for
such scripts. Make sure your script is fairly hard
to crack. Beyond that, all I could say.. if somebody
is *determined* to break into yours it's just a matter
of time before they actually do it.

Hosting a cgi script doesn't mean you are going to
announce that to the entire world anyway. Make it
accessible only to the probing server. IMHO, The
weakest point may not necessarily be a cgi script
but your own local machine. Somebody gaining access
to your machine can get the login details of your
remote accounts and could expl0it them as easily.

Anyway, I am asking out of curiosity..
Is their such thing as a non-exploitable solution?

Kumaraguru

I have no idea what each SET refers to. What is the
relationship between index number, value to write, SET
and settings array?

Can you elaborate on what you are actually trying to
do, rather than giving implementation code?

poor openBSD, even they had a buffer-overflow issue! Obviously nothing
is uncrackable.  We can  only do  our level best  to avoid  taking the
risky route  (like CGI). Of course, it  may all work out  in the ideal
world where the programmer knows  how to write unexploitable code. Not
in the real-world, sorry.

hi all,
	Iam using Red Hat linux version 9, recently I installed Win XP!

	1. It erased the GRUB
	2. Tried reinstalling GRUB using rescue mode with the bootable RH CD.
	3. Shows sysimage and iam able to change the root to it
	4. When i install the GRUB its entering into GRUB mode
	5. I exit the GRUB and REBOOTED the system, 

	But the grub is not getting installed, i don't know any other way to proceed!
The command i used to reinstall was
---------------------------------------------------------		
to change the root i gave --> 

		chroot /mnt/sysimage , and then
 
		# grub -install /dev/hda

---------------------------------------------------------
	is this command the right one? if yes its not working anyway! plz

you can ask around on the list - put a [commercial] tag in the subject

or start a section on the ilugc wiki where people can discuss linux 
laptop issues and at the same time buy / sell laptops .. but care has to 
be taken to keep the ritchie street dealer types from overrunning the

Something similar to tuxmobile.org with each of the laptop owners 
describing their Linux Laptop and how they managed to install it.

Also the url's for the laptop H/W drivers could be posted.

No bazee.com auctioning allowed :)

Hi,
Thanks for providing the wonderful information provided
by all. It gave me lot of insight in achieving the
crontab like feature by different means.

On digging around the system and man pages for some
more time, I found that crontab allows user(non root) also
to add entries in user specific crontab.

The crontab version and the Linux version I provide
herewith.

Linux 2.2.25
and
(Cron version -- $Id: crontab.c,v 2.13 1994/01/17 03:20:37 vixie Exp $)

Thanks and regards,

Read a brief review @

http://sudhir-lp.blogspot.com/2005/01/bsnl-announces-broadband-tarrif.html

on how the present pricing policy is skewed in favor the business user
rather than home user. 10GB of transfer for a home user is more
expensive than 10GB of transfer for a corporate user.

Of course, till June, it appears to be a free-for-all :)

Thanks for putting up the poster in your college.
Please find the updated poster here:

http://www.geocities.com/cyborg4k/haatreya.jan.22.29.2005.pdf

Sorry for the inconvenience.

If you guys still want, we can meet and have a general
discussion/question-answer session. I can think of two
places at the moment:

1/ Ashwita, Radhakrishnan Salai
2/ Barista, Gopalapuram

What are the other places that you can think of?

Madhukar was wanting to discuss kernel-stuff. Mail me
or call me (98407-87007) so we can fix the place and
time (4:00 PM onwards, Saturday) to meet. Everybody
can probably join and we can have a casual meet. 

Your thoughts?

Subject: [Ilugc] Bharathi's "One Day One Command" on LiveJournal
Message-ID: <20050113183711.GA4185@symonds.net>

hello,

Here is  my part in helping  to make Bharathi's "One  Day One Command"
mails into something accessible:

I went  to the archives  and downloaded the  gzip" and parsed  out the
"One Day One Command" Mails. Thanks  to bharathi for keeping them in a
consistent format.  It turned out that he has sent only about 5 so far
:) I  could have as  well opened the  archive by hand and  copy pasted
them into files. :)

Then it occured  to me that having an LJ community  for ILUGC would be
useful in more  than one ways. Not just in getting  these "One Day One
Command" onto LJ and being able to  get them in RSS but also that many
people have livejournal accounts and  they post something or the other
technical. They might as well post in the ilugc lj community as well.

Here is the thing so far:

http://www.livejournal.com/community/ilugc/

My stupidity, I should have somehow "intelligently" appended something
to  the  subject. The  RSS  feed  titles will  not  make  sense as  of
now. Whoever wants to be moderator can probably edit it by hand.

for the future:

either Bharathi can post to this LJ community as and when he sends out
a mail (not preferable - extra work for bharathi. probably lesser work
than updating a twiki, but its still requires effort!)

or

one of  us who knows  for sure that  we never miss out  fetching ilugc
emails can  setup a  procmail filter to  extract bharathi's  mails and
post them  to LJ. I  used http://sourceforge.net/projects/ljclive/ for
posting the entries so far but  its *sloooow* even on a machine with a
decent pipe (symonds.net). Solutions? Volunteers?

cheers,

  -Suraj

My apologies for pulling this offtopic. However, in the interest of an
increasing number of people who are blogging and are potential
candidates, I was wondering if the question might make some sense here
and there could be some interesting answers.

Does anyone know what are the major advantages/disadvantages of 
Livejournal.com over Blogger.com ?

I presently have a blog (http://sudhir-lp.blogspot.com) at Blogger.com
account and am able to post to it via tools like w.bloggar. It also
allows post via email option (which I can use for automated script
posts), though it's not necessarily the most secure option. And it also
allows comments to be emailed to the owner of the blog, not to mention
having an option to email those comments also to a mailing-list. And it
provides ATOM feeds. There may be other things which I haven't covered,
but there are most of the things that I find useful.

Things that it lacks (IMO) is the ability to categorize, the ability to
comment backtrack.

Anyone have anything useful to add the Blogger.com side or point me to 
things that are beautiful in Livejournal.com ?

Cheers,
Sudhir.P

I wouldn't call it 'beautiful', but you can have 'user pics' in LJ. So 
if you comment/blog, a stamp-size pic shows up on the left. And I can 
set current 'moods'. And I use LogJam(which is pretty feature-rich) to 
blog directly from my debian box.

Not only LJ, there are also other sites like deadjournal.com, .....
[google for rest] that uses livejournal.org.  I do not love LJ to the
full extent, it is written in Java :P

That is true. That proves that any language is not inferior / superior

It uses bean markup language (.bml).  No flame war to start, but I

Hi friends,
things didnt work with Mandrake 10.0  official since the acpi

Message-ID: <da6a4312050115202437f221b3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!
  
      I recently upgraded my computer from a 128MB RAM by adding
another 128MB RAM. It's a P3 SD3 RAM as told by my vendor. Ever since
I upgraded my comp it has hanging quite often. Some of my freinds say
it could be because of a RAM conflict. How do I check the frequencies
of the two RAM's ?  Or is the source of the problem something else????

Bye!

HI,

http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/java-trap.html
This article on gnu.org, makes me raise some
questions..

I use .MOV , .WMV, .ASF and .MP3 codecs to play
multimedia files on xine or mplayer.

Do these codecs qualify as F/OS Software ?
Can these codecs be used in Industry for Professional
use without any Licensing Issues ?

Regards,

Hi,

Afaik, WMV ASF and MP3 codecs certainly cannot be
deemed free. VirtualDub project was asked to drop
support for ASF by microsoft
http://www.advogato.org/article/101.html
And I believe the same applies for WMV.

MP3 codecs need a licence from Thomson and Fraunhofer
and it never was a free format.

Issue 1 Volume 1 of this new magazine has just hit the (cyber)stands. And, 
don't be too surprised, you're free to download a copy too of this 78-page 
publication. Some of the articles in the first issue:

 	o File formats; format wars (Marco Fioretti)
 	  File formats: the past, the present, a possible future

 	o XML: The answer to everything? (Kay Ethier, Scott Abel)
 	  This article weighs the pros and cons of XML for some
 	  applciations (publishing) and explores why it is the
  	  best possible solution for many programming and
 	  publishing needs.

 	o Free file formats and the future of intellectual
   	  freedom (Terry Hancock)
 	  Information as property may be served by closed
 	  file formats, but the freedom of information
 	  requires free formats.

 	o Creating the Free Software Magazine (Tony Mobily)
 	  A long path that takes us to the very beginning
 	  of this project.

 	o Mac OS X: Welcome to the jungle -- a look inside the
 	  Mac OS X software ecology (Chris J Karr)

 	o The magic of live CDs (Harish Pillay)
 	  What are live CDs, and how do they work?

 	o Every engineer's checklist for justifying
 	  Free Software. It's not just about 'no licence fees'
 	  (Malcolm D Spence)

 	o Smarter password management (John Locke)
 	  How to handle your passwords without getting lost

 	o The content tail wags the IT dog (Daniel James)
  	  Without hardware and software, there would be
 	  nothing for digital media to be created on, or used
 	  with. And yet the content industry attempts to tell
 	  the far larger IT industry what it can and cannot do.

 	o Motivation and value of free resources. Wikipedia
 	  and Planetmath show the way (Aaron E Klemm)

 	o It's all about freedom (Christian Einfeldt)
 	  Freedom is free software's competitive advantage.

 	o The Commons (Dave M Berry)
 	  The Commons as an Idea -- Ideas as a Commons

 	o Let's not forget our roots (Free Software is not
 	  just about cost or stability; it's a movement that
 	  mustn't forget the principles which made it possible)
 	  Tom Chance.

funny - i switched to gnome 2.8.2 (from dropline) and it is rather 
slicker, and a bit faster than I remember it.

was using a recent xfce 4.2 RC till now along with nautilus and metacity 
instead of xfce's window manager.

Don't panic, Can you please give the partition layout before and after 
the installation of RH9 (fdisk -l) and the boot.ini file in the primary 
partition. I doubt that the partition number of WinXP has changed so you 
probably had to put the right one in the boot.ini file.

I never denied that (I guess you meant linux has _a_ few features of a
microkernel, the meaning isn't quite the same otherwise :)....My point
is that this run-time modularity is needed much for distros - as a
single user, you know most of your requirements beforehand, and hence
can use the performance compile time selection offers.

NO...your argument is valid only when you don't use all the modules -
as is the case with a distro...if that's not the case, it is the other
way round, though only by a small measure.
Also, I prefer compiling modules you know will be used always, not
*all* modules...

Well, again I never said that you can't do it...I know about initrd
and its benefits...
I quote myself -

Are you going to umount the root partition? No. So that module is
going to be referenced throughout. Now, in such a case a module
doesn't offer any advantage...On the other hand, take the floppy
driver - it makes sense to use it as a module if you don't use the
floppy too often. Gets loaded only when you actually use the floppy
and then can be removed after you finish using it.

Do remember that initrd does have its overhead - so, why use it when
not required?

it moves on...

I guess the module is loaded, that directory shouldn't have been there
otherwise....
Workaround: use lm_sensors, with the corresponding kernel modules (see
my prev. mail) - this is independent of ACPI...

File server & Desktops seperately.

I can brief you what runs on Desktops and Servers:

*Desktops*

3. Email
4. Web browsing
5. Accounting

The average user has

*Engineering desktop *
1. Word processing

4. Pro/Engineer
5. Simulation and analysis

The average user has

Nowadays Fedora comes with lot of bugs. FC3 uses 'udev' a new feture that
dynamically manage /dev/ directory. I suspect this could cause trouble for you.
I myself a long time Fedora user and a RHCE, but I personally suggest you to
choose some other distro if you are not a hacker by yourself.

There had been enough debates on adopting udev 
or not. according to Gregs paper 
"http://www.kroah.com/linux/talks/ols_2003_udev_paper/Reprint-Kroah-Hartman-OLS2003.pdf" 
  udev seems to be the need of tomorrow. So, 
instead of shying away from it, i'd rather 
recommend you to find out the real problem and 
fix them.

What bug do you claim udev introduces?

Most modern distros of linux use udev and it is quite stable and far 
more efficient than the old static /dev tree as far as I can see.

Yes, debian still (by default) uses /dev and Ubuntu used udev.

You can do nothing as it is on gmane.
But you can write your own CSS file

I heared that static /dev will be removed from the kernel due to 
the lack of a maintainer. Inspite of /udev being in infancy it 
seems to be doing well.

Well, the maintainers of udev at Fedora actually crib that every
problem in FC3 seems to get associated with udev...yes, udev is the
way to go, and I suggest that you look at other possible aspects of
the problem as well, rather than just blaming udev...

it moves on...

I dont say udev is buggie, but the distro is not stable enough for an
average user who just wants plug 'n' play.

Yes, epiphany saves this user setting and renders the webpage with

Subject: [Ilugc] Take a Break - Try BSD!
Message-ID: <20050117203551.21295.qmail@webmail25.rediffmail.com>

Dear peers!
	If it doesn't trouble you let me share my *first* experience with one of the best unix Flavours - FreeBSD. A few months before, I received a copy of FreeBSD-5.2.1 along with a magazine. I was really happy to see the cute little Beastie - FreeBSD mascot. There were two iso-images (1 installation + 1 rescue) in a DVD. I loop mounted the image on my linux box and went through the installation guide. This was my first surprise - There were around 10 types of installation listed. There was an option to install from a primary DOS partition, which was the only option applicable for my box (I didn't wanna burn the images on a CD). But to my dismay the 1GB partition was not enough size. Then suddenly had a flash, yes my favourite toy qemu should be of some use, I thought. Took a quick backup of mbrs & dbrs and launched qemu (qemu -hda /dev/sda -cdrom <disk1.iso> -boot d). The installer was very nice and fast. It seems that FreeBSD can be installed only on a primary partition; luckily I had room for two primary partitions. FreeBSD is really nice here - It slices a single partition in to many peaces and each of the slice acts like a separate partition. It also suggested the aprox space required for each partition. I happily formatted /dev/ad4s4[a-g] with ufs(native filesystem) and flagged off to start installation. Installation was over in 15 mins, further answering the installer took around 5 mins. Chose to have the loader on the dbr and rebooted to load the FreeBSD kernel for the first time. I was really really happy - it happily detected all my hardware (80GB SATA hdd, floppy driver, ide-dvd, ps/2 mouse/keyboard...). After all the bootup messages finally popped up the 80x25 term. Everything went fine until now but now started the trouble. the keybindings were weirdy and my favourite vim didn't obey my orders, adding to all this X (XFree86) would never start. I, for the first time, took the monitor manual and found out the Horiz and vertical freq. X seemed to be uncontrollable. also except for msdos I could not mount my other partitions ext3 & reiser. and I finally decided to give up for now and sadly I laid BSD to rest ;-(.
	
	Sometime later, I thought of trying the latest version of XFree86 and downloaded the ~30M files on my dialup (Took an entire night) only to forget about it. 

	Three days leave for PONGAL... I was reading an article on NetBSD at os.sourceforge.net and it inspired me to tame this daemon. Booted in to FreeBSD and straightaway started the XFree86-4.4.0 installation. Voila! X started - Luckily I had the 'via' driver in this version. 
The desktops included in FreeBSD were.
* Gnome 2.4.1
* KDE 3.1.4
* FVWM
* TWM

along with -
* KOffice
* KDevelop
* Quanta plus
* Opera, mozilla, ...

I really wondered, if a single CD can contain these many tools. They were so sweet and I especially love the gnome splash screen. I could even configure ACME to use all of my multimedia keys. played with all those tools for some time....

Accidently i came across a tool called 'vidcontrol'. This is used to setup the video mode for the console. I liked the 80x30 mode with swiss font. Cool!!!
(Know any similar tool for linux???  possibly setfont)

longed for more... wanted to mount my reiser and ext3 partitions. reiserfs was easy, googled reiserfs+FreeBSD and straight to the reiserfs port... compiled reiserfs as a module and loaded (readonly-happy with it). google had nothing to offer for ext3. Queued the task for some time later and had a look at the FreeBSD manual. To my surprise it had a word on ext2 and said that it is present in the source and by default not built in to the kernel. So wanted to compile the kernel, little hope if it would ever compile, for I have not even compiled a hello, world on BSD. OK, but let me try, I thought and followed the instruction (Options  EXT2FS) and started building the kernel. All the required tools were installed by default. Compilation was going fine until it threw a kernel exception. So what could be the reason? I restarted and found that the disk was only 150MB free. thought it could be the reason and removed the ports directory to free up some 250MB and restarted the build. Finally got a neat build. installed the new kernel and to my delight ext3 partitions could be mounted (readonly).

Loading and unloading the kernel modules are really very easy. Also automatic loading at boot time is also easier than in linux. Downloaded a nice splash image for the bootup screen. also, the console screen savers are cool!!!

Altogether it was a nice experience having had a chance to tame the great daddy of OS'. What a way to celebrate ~//~PONGAL~\\~

So whats up this weekend??? Take a copy of FreeBSD and click install! Wanna copy? mail me or call me to burn one (http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/CDs_for_Grab).

Sorry, what is cal? What is BC? Can you avoid using

There are educational CDs exclusive for school
students. These softwares are entirely GUI based.

Education Live CD list:
http://www.frozentech.com/content/livecd.php?sort=&showonly=education

tldp.org has good tutorials. I believe desktop
environments have their own help center.

KDE help center:
http://docsrv.sco.com:8457/en/KDEdoc/khelpcenter/

Or, we can plan some demos/tutorials for school
students :)

Greetings!

I would like to thank the Computer Science Department
- the students, professors, HOD and Dean, Kongu
Engineering College, Erode for giving me an
opportunity to conduct a one-day workshop/seminar on
"GNU/Linux/OSS" on January 17, 2005 (Monday). 

Special thanks to Arvind Kalyan (final year, CS) who
has been working with me for the past three weeks in
meticulously planning the seminar, and answering my
questions. Special thanks goes to the Management for
the good hospitality and stay provided at the guest
house. The infrastructure at your college is
_state-of-the-art_. Thanks for providing all the
required facilities for the seminar.

The following is a quick summary of the workshop
events:

Session I: "Careers with GNU/Linux/OSS" (morning)
Presentation slides can be downloaded from (2 MB):
http://www.geocities.com/cyborg4k/kongu.gnu.linux.oss.jan17.2005.pdf

Session II: Introduction to device driver programming
(morning)
Simple device driver code examples (demo) can be
downloaded from:
http://www.geocities.com/cyborg4k/kongu.jan17.2005.device.drivers.tar.gz

Session III: Knoppix demo and GNU/Linux installation
(afternoon)

Session IV: Watched the movie, The.Code.Linux.avi

suresh@etherkiller:~$ man 1 cal

suresh@etherkiller:~$ man 1 bc
[arbitrary precision calculator language]

though I think he wanted a calendar for BC years (2000 BC for example)

Sometimes with cdrecord .. my system freezes ... what might be the
reason?? (Yes, I do dev=/dev/cdrom) ... has anyone else experiencing
the same problem? No useful logs.

<mood irritated>
 ..  now who is doing the crappy work? Joerg Schilling or Linus Torvalds?

Some one please tell where this log for cdrecord (or IDE driver) will
be found ... I didn't find anything related in /var/log

cdrecord is setuid in recent versions to fix a security bug - so you 
either use sudo, or work as root to burn cds

try ide-scsi instead of just ide - and see if specifying dev=/dev/hdc 
(say) works for you

There are some Open formats (Ogg Vorbis) which are not covered by
exclusive patents. Its your choice to either switch to Open
formats or to stick to whatever proprietary formats you've been
using. However, there is Free Software for both. 

Its advisable to use Open formats as a protest against the
irrelevance of the software patent system.

Is it possible to read a DVD through CD-ROM drive(compact

AFAIK, DVD media,data format and the mechanism of
reading DVD is different and therefore CD-ROM drive
cannot be used for reading DVD.

Pls share your thoughts.

Interested to know even if it is in M$ windows.

Thank you for your interest, but due to some restrictions within our
college, it was not possible to allow non-students to attend this time
around.

The next time we organize something like this, we will make
arrangements for allowing all those interested to attend and get the
benefit out of it.

Thankyou,

Students of KEC, you can get the CD from me if you are unwilling to
download if yourself.

I hope to see our students use your expert advice on how to look at
the subjects for actual industrial purposes and realise their
significance.

We all liked your tempo. Was just the right one to grasp the attention
of most of our students.


> Session III: Knoppix demo and GNU/Linux installation (afternoon)

We learnt the importance of the various parameters that you pass
during installation. Also the various ways of installation; such as
network installation, etc.


> Session IV: Watched the movie, The.Code.Linux.avi (evening)

Students in KEC can get the movie off of our server, if you want you

The address you see in /proc/pci is physical address.
The address returned from ioremap is virtual address.

Hi,

In Mozilla Thunderbird (1.0), I am not able to "Reply to Sender" when I receive a mail from mailing list like yahoogroups.  Whether I press "Reply" or "Reply-all", it is only taking the list id. instead of the sender id.  Does any one faced similar problems?  I have been using Thunderbird from version 0.3 and I faced this problem in all the versions.

Which scheduler are you talking about ?

Process Scheduler , Block I/O Scheduler or Network Scheduler ?

AFAIK, yahoo sets the groups ID in the reply-to header. so any reply
will be sent to the group rather than the original sender.

This problem is not with the mail client.

Subject: [Ilugc] Fedora Core 2 KDE Icons
Message-ID: <6120c538050118020323bab3c1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am having a small but disturbing problem. I am too used to the KDE
classic fonts that when I installed Fedora Core 2 and found only 3
sets of fonts in the KDE Contol Centre which were the connectiva
crystal, bluecurve and one more (I think SVG...), I was a bit
dejected.

Anyway I searched the CDs for *icon*.rpm to no avail but only to find
set of GNOME icons which were already installed. I even tried on th
RedHat 9 cds but to no avail. Then I realized that the icons maybe a
part of another package like kde-artworks. What I want to know is
whether on installing the package from RH9 CDs I will have any issues
in my existing Fedora installation as the artworks package will update
more things than just the icons.

Awaiting all levels of solutions for this apparently small peculiar
problem. Why are most distros cutting out on KDE icons now a days
anyway.

Any idea about an open format for video files.

Instead change the default CSS file and upload the file to some
website. Then include that CSS file in the blog and this settings will
be saved by default.
I tried this and it works great for me. I just changed all instances
of x-small or small to normal in the font-size attribute.
Here is the style sheet i use.  http://cnuker.freeserverhost.com/gmane.css

Hi,

What is the right order so that the bootloaders don't get screwed up ?
Windows Xp is already installed.

Should I install Linux first and then BSd or the other way ?

I too burnt the ISOs from the DVD and tried to install. But decided
that I need to learn more before trying FreeBSD. So I have postponed
the installation later. Right now I am happy with my Debian box.

Depends - if you want to use lilo/grub install linux first.  If not 
install freebsd.

And make sure you have enough primary partitions available.

Doesn't matter really, but make sure that you dont install the 
BSDs boot loader on the MBR unless you are familiar with it.

Actually there are some more limitations,
1. Freebsd can only be installed on a primary partition 
(http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+FreeBSD-2.html) so you should 
have one to spare.
2. If XP is in a logical partition, then according to the 
windows naming conventions the partition number would have 
incremented and you might need to update the boot.ini file.

After installing Linux (lilo/grub) do I need to install the FreeBSD
bootloader or can 
I use Grub to boot into FreeBSD ?

> And make sure you have enough primary partitions available.

Yeah, I've had previous bad experiences with extended partitions +
freebsd .

depends - if you're more comfortable with grub than with the freebsd 
bootloader, feel free to use that.

grub (or lilo) will boot anything for you - solaris/i386, *bsd, windows 
- all it has to do is to point to the appropriate boot partition and 
pass any other boot parameters that are necessary for bootup.

Yes currently working on one.
It needs to be perfect, cause I'm dealing with 30GB+ of music.
I need to convert the mp3 to ogg and delete the mp3 file since I don't
have enough
hard disk space for both ogg and mp3 :)

Use "fg" to bring it to the front, or %programname (eg: %emacs).

You can also use something like "fg emacs", or "fg pid". Similarly, to make a 
task go to the background, C-z it and run "bg" or "bg programname"

HTH! :)

I get another doubt because of your answers.

An ISO image (files present in compact disk) can be
dumped into a hard disk.  Without any CDROM drive and
with the help of some tools(like cd emulator or virtual
cd drive for MS windows) it can be accessed later if
I want.

If the organizing and structuring of data in any media
is already known, then why not dumping the content of dvd
into hard disk OR reading thru cd drive not possible through
some tool like virtual cd drive OR loopback devices?

kindly pour your thoughts on the same.

regards,
carti

this can be done.

but how do you dump the dvd drive's contents onto the hdd without access 
to a dvd drive either on that machine or some other machine on the same 
network?

even if it is a machine on the same network, dumping the contents of a 
dvd drive to another machine reliably is rather time consuming .. i 
still remember karra sriram coming over to my place at 9 PM one night, 
rsyncing a copy of the PCQ sarge dvd onto his hard disk connected to my 
PC, while the dvd drive was mounted on my laptop, the PC's dvd combo 
drive having a technical snag of some kind ... and leaving a bit past 
midnight. :)

I doubt it will make a big difference - it doesn't for two Linuxes anyway!

What is the value of iom_len? You basically write
0xffffffff to base-address and read the value back.
Mask out the lower nibble and increment the resulting
value by 1 to get the size/len of the IO-mapped
region. Do read the PCI specification.

What type is ioaddr? iom_len?

Check the short.c example in linux device drivers code
examples.

It is not advisable to convert from one lossy compression format to
another...the sound quality will be poorer, and audible glitches may
surface...Agreed that we need to protest against non-free formats, but
given the number if mp3's that are around, a more practical solution
would be live it, and ensure that anything that you encode from now on
is done with free formats :)

it moves on...

Awesome.

I experienced FreeBSD 4.5 possibly before a year.
It worked like a charm on a 133Mhz Processor, 4GB HDD, 64mb EDO Ram.
It was all console though, with no monitor / keyboard attached with a
uptime of 49 days.
Never had time to play with X, and would love to. Probably some time soon.

A friend of mine had trouble in tuning X, may be you can make a
write-up of the whole process.

The first version I used FreeBSD 5.1.

It ran well on both my P4 and my old P1 166 Mhz.
Even X ran without any problems on my old SiS 6202 VGA card.

I also loved the ports package system and its simplicity.

Recently, I'm reading good reviews of NetBSD 2.0 with claims that 
It performs better/is faster than FreeBSD 5.3 on micro-management of
tasks.

no, you don't need microphone ears - it's enough if you are a serious
listener of music...and especially when you use earphones, this
occasional sound resembling the initial handshake noise of dialup
connections is one 'signature' of these re-encoded files - and if you
have good bass in your speakers, and especially when the bitrate is
above 160 kbps, do try to listen to the two files in a interspersed
manner - there will be a certain lack of richness.

it moves on...

Evolution with the Ximian connector, for native exchange access

Or if your exchange server has IMAP/POP3 and SMTP connectors enabled you 
can use anything you want (kmail, thunderbird etc)

Ximian Connector is now GPL-ed, thanks to Novell.

Evolution is being ported to Windows now.
Still in beta expect a release soon.

Beagle the desktop search tool based on D-Bus is now available on
Windows.
You will need the mono packages from CVS though to get it running.

Earlier it used to run on Cygwin, now it runs on Windows natively with
GTK.

Speaking of that - is it necessary to have hal and dbus on a gnome 2.8 
install?

I upgraded to dropline gnome 2.8 from gnome 2.6 recently - and the 
fstab-sync (part of hald) keeps updating my fstab so that an entry for 
/sys is created - though it is already in mtab.  So my initscripts try 
to remount /sys and fail - though as /sys is already mounted because of 
mtab things work after throwing that error.

       But, i could not digest this "Yes"...
   what is the diff then... if both r in physical

bcoz, i assuemed upto now that.....
      
  Memory mapped mean.. the IO-address lines is mapped

I'm running GNOME 2.8 on Sarge with HAL and DBUS.
No problems so far.
I'll need to confirm whether HAL is a pre-requisite for 2.8

Does sarge use udev + sysfs etc, or are they still on a static /dev tree?

Better...components like the gnome-volume-manager (mounts your devices
automatically) use them - morever, nice as a concept - a central
broadcasting server through which event sources could communicate with
listeners, with good configurability for the sysad...I would visualize
many of the present day 'information' daemons (say hddtemp, for
example) using this in the future.

You can prevent this by modifying the hal policy - write up a config
file in /usr/share/hal/fdi/[priority]some-name/storage-policy.fdi -
it's an xml file, the dtd is in /usr/share/hal/fdi.dtd - keep the
priority higher than the default policy (usually 90), so that your
policy gets overriden finally - see man fstab-sync for details....

afaik, beagle needs the inotify kernel patch as well...apart from some
other packages...
if you are using reiserfs, extended attributes (REISERFS_FS_XATTR)
must be enabled...
I am currently waiting for inotify to get to the mainstream - hopeful
that it won't be too long, considering it's advantages over dnotify.

it moves on...

Too damned many assumptions .. and how many packages like this go around 
requiring that a custom kernel be downloaded to satisfy dependencies 
like this? :(

Message-ID: <200501190642.BAA17881@www23.ureach.com>

Hi,
 I had this need. I run my own business. I want a way in which
many people can message me. I thought of putting my e-mail id in
company web-page and my business card but I feared misuse and
spam.
 I am now adopting this solution. This is no hi funda but
simple. I call it "personal message box" something like PO
box.Kind of re-branding form-mail. I thought of sharing it with
you folks. I plan to use it in my business card rather than my
e-mail id.
 Visit my Message box at
 http://www.geocities.com/vallinayagam. 

Also go through the spam avoid link,ie 
http://www.geocities.com/vallinayagam/spamavoid.html.

 In that page I express why this approach can reduce spam.

No., actually the difference is quite noticeable. I once advocated
to my friend to use Ogg., and he came back complaining that Ogg
did not have a good quality.. the reason was he created Oggs from
MP3s. But if you rip from the Audio CDs and convert them directly
to OGGs they are good. :)

If you are looking for a M$ Exchange like groupware solution you
should have a look at `kolab`. I've never used it though. I'm
looking forward for comments about kolab from people who've used
it.

Heh., one of my friends pointed out that there is a program which
will change all w32 shortcuts to Emacs shortcuts.. So to close a
window you can simply go C-x C-c ..

Address lines (from CPU) are mapped to I/O, eventually
using the addressable memory region. Have to use
readl(), writel() functions.

Few address lines from CPU are used just for I/O chip
select. As a result you have to use specific inb(),
outb() functions.

ioaddr should be of type - unsigned long.

mean RAM address)

Hi all,
    I feel that there is bug in the mailing list software. When I
click on the reply link in Gmail all the replies are going to the
author and not to the list address. I checked the headers of the
message and found that the reply-to field contains the address of the
author of mail and not the list address. Is this same for everyone ?.
If so please fix it.

yes, thats the  same for everyone.  read the archives  to find why its
set like this.  hit 'reply to all' or 'group  reply' or the equivalent

remember, there are  no tools (yet) to recover  a crashed reiserfs. If
you  care for  your  data, you  probably  would use  ext3 or  whatever
instead of "trying" out xfs. I put  all *my* data in an ext3 and my /,

Do not compare a mailman/majordomo based mailing list

They are different.

Not necessarily. It depends on the architecture.
Having 32 address lines gives the ability to address a
4G address space. Where it is mapped to depends on the
hardware.

void * is a generic type. It cannot be used directly.
It is useful to pass addresses (that can represent
anything). You will need to typecast it to use it.

No offence, but, if you do not wish to reply, please
ignore the e-mail. But, don't discourage a person from
asking questions. I don't see why ILUGC cannot be a
technical support center. It is a great place to learn
and provide technical help :)

No, this is a standard feature in mailing lists.  Mail reader are usually
powerfull enough to provide two functionalities: use the `Reply-To' or the
mailing-list.

Ofcouse, we can manually edit these too.

For emacs+gnus lovers, you can type f/F to reply to the mailing list and
r/R to reply to the author (much the same feel as when readin news from
nntp servers).

I have been using reiser4 for quite some time and is quite stable inspite
of my rough usage 

eg. swsusp. reboot normally, power off, resume --- supposed to kiss your
data goodbye before doing this (if you go by the kernel docs)

I never used Linux to check mail nor used Emacs. I use web mail
clients or Outlook Express(Hotmail account) to check mail. I do
subscribe to lot of mailing lists at Apache, CVS, PostgreSQL. This is
the only list I came across which behaves like this. Now I will hit
Reply to All in Gmail web UI.

    I searched in the archive at
yahoo(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ilugc-archive/) to find out why
ilugc behaves like this. The search results showed no relevant
information. So can any one please tell me why people dont like to
reply to the list but to individuals.

   I have some more suggestions. 
1. Put a link to a searchable list archive in the mail subscription page.
2. There is no link to Wiki in the home page.

ok, here's the link to the article (hmm...actually even I couldn't
find the topic in the archive at gmane...may be my search string
wasn't good...I got this by directly googling for the topic...So, I
don't know if this was the article Suresh had referred to).

I remember that I too had cribbed about this in my first mail...
This article surely made me think...

it moves on...

         Yeah Shakthi u r right...
if u wish to reply...if not ignore it, but, u should
not discourage the person from questioning...

its a way of sharing knowledge with others...
When we share knowledge only we can improve our
knowledge.....

Hi All;
Have anyone tried buying suse 9.2 professional cd's from

really genuine suse 9.2 ? The point is they are selling it at real
low cost and hence the doubt ! 
Please give me your feedback.
Thanks

  No idea, I'm quite happy with ext3 on cryptoloop.

  IMHO, FC3 is the best desktop distro that has come out of the RedHat
stable since RH 7.3. I still dislike the default Bluecurve desktop,
so I got rid of it and switched to xfce4 instead.

  I was able to perform a manual, selective upgrade of my primary
system (a heavily-upgraded RedHat 7.3 install) using just the binary
rpms from FC3, and a few SRPMs from previous RedHat distros. The
salient features are:

Linux-2.6.8.1 (tarball from kernel.org)
Static /dev tree (no udev)
glibc-2.3.3-74 (from FC3)
gcc-3.4.2-6.fc3
rpm-4.3.2-21 (from FC3)
XFree86-4.3.0-55 (recompiled with gcc34 - upgrading to X.org is hairy) 
xfce-4.1.99.2 (still buggy, but a lovely lightweight WM that's very
     easy on the eyes - I recommend the GTK style with the Xfce-kolors
     user-interface theme, but of course it's a matter of personal
     choice. This rivals fvwm2 in all-round usability)
rxvt-2.7.8 (replacement for xterm, which is a resource hog. Just say no)
mozilla-1.6.0.dag (an old and reliable release - I'll move to firefox after
     sorting out the dependencies)
postfix-1.1.13 (another legacy remnant)
cdrecord-2.0.1.1-5 (from FC3, supports native ATA CD-R/RW without IDE-SCSI.
  One minor observation is that it burns CD-Rs at an average speed of 32x
  on a 52x writer, with speed varying from about 20x at the start to 48x
  near the end. Pretty good, but I'm not sure if it's HW-constrained)
ogle-0.9.2 (for DVD playback)
qryptix (my own stuff, to encrypt home directories)
and a bunch of other stuff to satisfy dependencies - not too difficult.

The entire setup is rock-stable, and astonishly responsive as a desktop.
All of this is on a PIII-1Ghz/256 MB RAM/i815e with on-board VGA/sound.
I'd recommend recompiling some critical pieces (kernel, glibc, xfree86,
some other libraries) using gcc-3.4.2 to take advantage of the 2.6 
vsyscall, as well as other optimizations in gcc33 and gcc34 - the
-mregparm=3 for the kernel (transplanted from AIX/POWER/PowerPC,
which has had it since 1990(?)) is one of them. 

I'm investigating replicating the install on a legacy PII notebook
with 96 MB RAM - more later. Anybody who thinks that Gentoo is the
best-performing desktop distro, especially on resource-constrained
systems, should seriously consider FC3 instead. It rocks!

(Get the FC3 ISO images from this month's Digit DVD instead of the
installable DVD from last month's LFY, if you can. CDROM drives
are more prevalent on legacy systems.)

I've got one doubt here.
Then does it mean that u cannot recover files on a

bashrc is the profile configuration per user.
bash_profile is for the all the user.

when u do changes in bashrc, it is reflected to that particular user
when u do changes in bash_profil, it is reflected to all user

.bash_profile is executed for login shells (eg. virutal  terminals)

  I don't know, but Reiser4 doesn't have the reputation
of being industrial-strength. OTOH, I haven't lost a
single byte of data over the last 4 years with ext3 -
so I'm staying with ext3 until significant performance
advantages, combined with industrial-strength reliability,
are seen in xfs, reiser4, etc.

  The other main advantage of ext3 is that in a pinch, I
can repair an ext3 filesystem mounted as an ext2
filesystem, which is supported on a whole lot of install
CDs and liveCDs (RH 6.2, 7.x, 8.x, Knoppix, ...). I did
this recently on a system in which I'd accidentally
hosed glibc during an attempted upgrade, leaving the system
unbootable. I rebooted in rescue mode with a RH 7.3
install CD and repaired it without much effort. With
Reiser or anything more elaborate, I'd have been sunk -
it would have required a kernel with the appropriate
filesystem support compiled in.

I do not understand why you are comparing ext3 with reiser4. Reiser4
is new and of course needs more real world testing before 'mission
critical' data can be entrusted to it.
A fair comparison would be to compare ext3 with reiserfs (ver3).

I've always used Reiserfs since mandrake started using is as default.
I've never lost data to it due to corruption. The one time I did lose
data, it was my own 'rm -rf' mistake :)
This brings me to another question asked here:

You can certainly expect to recover files from an improper shutdown -
that's what a journalized file system is all about. Without getting
into technicalities, IMO Ext3 is no better than Reiserfs at handling
improper shutdowns. Does that sound too negative? What I mean is that
both are good at handling improper shutdowns.. but it's not like ext3
does it better than reiserfs.

The one thing that ReiserFS doesn't support is 'undelete' as I found
out after an inadvertant 'rm -rf'  I wrote a mini-howto to recover
data for reiserfs:

PS: Wasn't the thread about reiser4 vs xfs? :)

well..usually yes...but do remember that whether we start a login
shell or not doesn't really depend on the terminal. depends on how
bash is started - it behaves like a login shell when started with a
--login, -l or as -bash.

A modular setup could have the following components - a .login file
(or call it whatever you want) with all the environment settings, a
.bashrc with all interactive stuff like aliases, functions,
interactive bash options and startup commands, a .bash_profile with
the .login and the .bashrc sourced in, and you could preferably source
.login to your .xinitrc and .Xclients as well...this is out of
experience, so do tell me if there is a technically more correct
method....

it moves on...

reiserfs is one true journalled fs - that means that you can pull the
plug while bunzip2'ing a kernel archive and still come up with a
consistent fs with as little data loss as possible - this has been
tested - or may be do something more drastic as rajsekar did with
swsusp...don't recommend it though :)...

I may be wrong, but I still can't help feeling that ext3 is ext2
'patched' with journalling features...

In addition, reiserfs is found to save as much as 15% on hard disk
space and has been benchmarked to have better performance - besides
some other theoretical advantages like ability to store unlimited
number of files (within you hard disk space, obviously), as compared
to ext* where you need to specify a cap on the number of files you
will be able to store.

Hey, how's the performance on cryptoloop? I imagined that it would be
a nightmare!!

it moves on...

I maintain the following:

.bashrc -- all variables, aliases.
.bash_profile -- nothing  but a  shell script that  determines what it
should start for the "session". (ie.,. screen)
functions.sh --  shell functions that are  invoked regularly ('emacs',
'dirrc', etc.,.)

At work,  since I will have  to login to several  hundred machines and
since some machines dont  have some capabilities (depending on whether
they are 'production' or  'development' boxes) the "session" part gets
modified accordingly  (ie.,.  whether it should  run ssh-agent, screen
or simply give a shell, etc.,.)

cheers,

Hi all,
    I want to improve the performance of our server which is running
PostgreSQL  on RHL 7.0. For this I think it is best to upgrade the
kernel to 2.4 or 2.6.  When I looked at the requirements specified in
Changes file some of the requirements are not satisfied. So my
question is whether I can install a new kernel without satisfying the
dependencies specified in Changes file.
    I have no spare server.

Message-ID: <200501201327.IAA15636@www22.ureach.com>

Hi,
 I don't know what do you mean by persistent. I use lycos.co.uk
to host some php scripts for free. Those php scripts provide me
with personal wiki functionality.

Reposting this because I have not been able to locate KDE Classic
anywhere. Even google didnt help. Will installing a backlogged version
of kde-artwork cause a problem.

Message-ID: <96dc1b390501202019545175c8@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,
I have been using Lisa(through the built-in interface in konqueror) in
fedora to browse the local area network. It is quick and hassle free..
However, it is quite different in Debian.. inspite of starting the
lisa deamon and opening the required ports, konqueror refuses to
recognise the fact that lisa is running. A click on the 'lisa' option
in its services frame sends konqueror into a dizzy . I am sure that I
have changed all the required settings to what they are in
fedora(where lisa is working).. but lisa doesn't work.
Has anybody faced similar problems??

This thing talks about lists that change `Reply-To' to the mailing list
address.  Ours changes it to the author's address... or maybe I haven't

Basically this applies to community lists like ours.  I still prefer
reply-to-list in the case of special purpose mailling lists like
python-dev, twisted-web, ....

ps: my mail client (webmail: gmail) does not support reply-to-list-only

Hi,
 "linux" - means different things to different people. For most
part, they assume the command line and GUI applications running
on linux and the facilities given by the platform for the
applications to run co-operatively. 
  This is my advice. It is better that whatever you learn can be
applied in windows platform too. I would suggest take a TCL
shell, in linux or windows and start doing command line stuffs.
In TCL, the difference between command line and programming
language is not there. 
  I would suggest this investment of time and efforts pays-off
more than learning basic linux-specific commands like "ls" .
Whatever you have learnt can be applied in windows and linux
except for platform specific issues.Infact , it is an
un-advertised fact that TCL has many cross-platform attributes
and satisfies many things that java claims too.
 In TCL shell, you would feel you are in command line mode and
not programming language . Then get to know the boot sequence
and then kernel compilation. I started with SuSE and moved to
Debian. I would suggest start with knoppix live-cd , no install
required.

Boot with a linux bootable disk / rescue cd / any bootable cd that lets you
specify commandline boot options, then do a fdisk -l and see if you can list
the partitions out.

hi All,

We had the bash shell scripting session
as planned.

Just wrote a couple of lines at the wiki:

How do I upload the tarred file (containing

My suggestion is to try all the distros you could "think" of. :)  But
do not forget the command line.  You must be able to use/setup almost
anything from command line.  Thus fedora/redhat/mdk may not be
important distro at all.

You may start off with slackware and may eventually move on to debian.

See 'Upload file' in special page.  
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/Special:Upload

Give meaningful names to your uploads.

ps: all uploads, can be seen through recentchages page. so moderators,
must delete illegal uploads. Is there anyone actively watching the
recentchanges page?

Thanks. Sorry, that I couldn't make it, was stuck with
work. I wanted to discuss couple of things today
regarding enhancing the scope of GNU/Linux Vidyashram
and topics that are scheduled in the pipeline. We
shall have the discussion next week, after shell
scripting session II.

Thanks again,

K Shakthi

Any of the off-the-shelf distros are good. 

As far as what teaches you better it depends on what
you want to learn. It really doesn't matter what
distro you use, only the relevant software packages
are important.

Building a Linux-From-Scratch would be a good way of learning a lot of
things that  you will  generally not learn  otherwise. But  thats only
after you know  some of the basics. So any of  the above distros would
be a good place to start.

And Gentoo would be a nice compromise! ;-) At least, if you can follow the 
docs for a while!

Of course, this is only really good if you've got a net connection that can 
support it (broadband, essentially)...

Sorry, from  what I  see on #debian  gentoo population is  "immune" to
docs. They  know docs  exist. They follow  docs.  but dont  get fundas
into their  head.  Thats  quite bad for  learning.  Probably  it works
well for getting things done. But thats not the point.

I think for a beginner, gentoo or linux from scratch is too difficult.

i think fedora core / mandrake will be better to learn the commands &
know about various linux issues before getting much into the internals

That's because you're on #debian... ;-)

Look in f.g.o and #gentoo, and the picture is different. It all depends on 
what you do with it.

Actually, I think you can't separate learning the commands and learning the 
issues. Especially Mandrake, Xandros and others - they move you away from the 
actual OS, to the extent that you don't know it exists...

Ubuntu is good, too, but I like plugging Gentoo! :-D

Hi,

So finally we have confused the new man very throughly !

Well here enters the Red Hat fan, I would suggest Fedora Core 3, hoping 
you have a good new machine. New machine in the sense it has a decent 
processor (PIII equivalent or above) and decent amount of HDD. If you want 
to be stingy for space then try minimal installation and miss some thing 
and then wonder why something doesnt work !

Nice to be back on the list after a gap of more than 2 years. In case 
people forgot who I am, I am the guy in aero department, well may name on 
google shows a lot of archives with my responses in it.

Hi suraj and Prabhu. Feels pretty nostalgic to be back on the list. I miss 
our man Mr.M.K.Saravanan.

Well now that I am on the list, will add more activity to the list :D

Yes. FC3 would be good for him. Or Mandrake. 
After a few months of working in these, he can make the switch to
Debian or gentoo.
But IMHO Knoppix is good for beginners. After a few days of working in
the Live CD, he can do a hard disk install and have a Debian based
system.

Subject: [Ilugc] dual booting -XP and Fedora
Message-ID: <20050123033156.80205.qmail@web30201.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear all,
This is the way I have setup dual booting and I am
using this for the past 2 years without any problems.
1. Install Windows XP
2. Install Fedora.In the bootloader configuration
install the grub bootloader on the dedicated /boot
partition or the single / partition as per your setup
preference in disk setup[dont install it in
/dev/hda[mbr]]
3. Extract XOSL [free] in c:
4. Read the XOSL manual that comes along witrh it to
get more idea.
5.boot using windows boot floppy
6.Install XOSL
Adv: 
1.You may uninstall XOSL any time restoring to
previous setup and also if you change your mindset to
install grub on /dev/hda you may install grub later.


Moreover there is no fear in dualbooting any linux
with WinXp/2000 because, if any problem occurs you may
use fixmbr and bootcfg to rectify windows booting
corruption.
And in in a similar way you may restore your grub by
booting with fedora rescue CD. and do chroot and
grub-install.

Trust me because I have triple booted winXP,slackware
and Fedora core 1 without any problems in my 20 GB
hdd. 

You may also use some utilities to backup your boot
records and restore them when they get corrupted.



If this input is useless please neglect...

bye,
ignacius

Many times said. Still telling once more ...

A new user of Free Software world should try all the available distros
and finally settle on the one, he feels comfortable. Then you can start
talking, how your choice of distro is better than others ;)

This would be the best way to go about learning Linux.
You get to taste all the dishes on the table and you
can make out the common ingredients in them ;)

It really doesnt matter as in the end you will end up
with either a RedHat based or a Debian based one.

If you are an elitist, you might even end up using
FreeBSD or Slackware.

By way of analysis we may proceed from compounds to
         ingredients.            --Sir I.Newton.

Learning the ingredients(UNIX) is more important that
the compounds(Linux Distro's).

If you move from one fedora kernel to another nothing should break.

If you use a vanilla kernel you download off kernel.org all bets are off -
fedora kernels are heavily patched and customized.

Lots of stuff will still work but random failures here and there are a likely
result if you run an app that expected a kernel patch to be there when it isnt
- or when you had supermount enabled in the fedora kernel so that any CD you
insert shows up on your gnome desktop, but not when you compile your vanilla
kernel ..

Actually, I think you can't separate learning the commands and learning the 
issues. Especially Mandrake, Xandros and others - they move you away from the 
actual OS, to the extent that you don't know it exists.

I started with an old redhat, moved to slackware and freebsd.

Briefly flirted with redhat again. Moved right back to slackware desktop and
freebsd server [for personal use that is - all our work boxes are RH]

The only time I ever tried debian was when someone convinced me to try
installing slink.  Took one horrified look at the nonintutive install (dselect
among other things) and went straight back to happy un-debianned life.

srs, this story, "srs and dselect", has become
legendary on the ilugc mailing list.

I feel you should give Debian another try before
condemning it for life. 

A lot has changed.... :)

srs, If I patch the vanilla kernel with the latest -ac
patchset will I get teh fedora kernel ?

just wondering cause I always see Alan's posts on LKML
beginning with "RPMS are being prepared for..."

So I guess you could try one of teh -ac kernels with
your modem driver.

OK guys - someone who does know and use debian on a regular scale, and 
is near Adyar (Karra? Toufeeq?) come over to my place and help me 
install it.  I've got a PC desktop install of slackware 10 that doesnt 
have much on it now .. wouldnt mind blowing it away and seeing what 
debian looks like.

Though the last few times (years back) I tried various other distros I 
always found myself reinstalling slackware anywhere from a few days to 
some months afterwards, so ... :)

Alan Cox works for Redhat but so do several other kernel and gcc hackers

So what you see on fedora and rhel is not just stock RH - there's lots 
and lots of other patches (poke around the contents of a kernel src.rpm 
sometime)

See http://www.linuxsecurity.com/content/view/106183/102/ for changelogs

Hmm. I heard this story, for the first time, in Linux India, IIRC.
That was in 1998 or so. That was the time I started using Debian
(potato) and I fell love with Debian.

Years past, still SRS hate Debian and MDK (me) loves Debian :-)

Thanks Dileep.
You mail made me do a little experiment.

A google search for "Suresh Ramasubramanian +
Debian"...

and the results are:
Results 1 - 10 of about 3,360 for suresh
ramasubramanian debian. (0.24 seconds) :)

(Man, I need to get away from the computer)

soon. :(

Message-ID: <a0c4f62705012306073613d955@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

In the Shell scripting class held last Saturday, I asked whether sh
isn't just a symbolic link to bash on Linux systems, and that wasn't
agreed upon.

But I am now on an FC3 system, and here's the info:

$ cd /bin
$ ls -l sh
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 4 Jan  2 17:01 sh -> bash

The same is true for Debian. Is it so on *all* GNU/Linux systems?

Thanks.
Kumar

The same on slackware current too

For the simple reason that I dont think Bourne Shell is available under 
GPL.  It'd be under a bsd style license I guess - which is why it is 
available as a shell on freebsd (bash is something you'd have to install 
as a separate package - its not part of the base system on freebsd)

Absolutely. At least, on all that I've seen...

It's a symlink just so that the admin can change it to whatever he wants. Some 
people prefer to have csh or ksh as default, for example. Bash is the 
standard, though. At least, de facto standard...

Yes. Debian is really great. Even I (newbie) could install it on my
system and it was a breeze (PCQ DVD Dec04)
I think you can try debian now by yourself.

> I started with an old redhat, moved to slackware and freebsd.
> 

I started with Slackware (coincidentally the same time when PCQuest
released it back in '96). After about 2 years of Minix+Linux+FreeBSD on
my home computer, I tried Redhat 5.2, Mandrake Linux, Debian (potato)
and found them all much different, yet interesting to play with.

With all the latter distributions, I begin tweaking their system
configuration files by hand to optimize boot time, reduce number of
processes running, and removing unncessary cruft (mostly left by the
various "standards committee") to make my system lean, fast and more
responsive - and I end up having them look/feel/behave like a Slackware
box.

In my office, I preferred using RH 6.1 and Debian potato on servers
(pre-2001). They are best installed once, and left running - perhaps
with security updates/kernel upgrades once in a while.

I was a bit impressed with Gentoo lately, but then two reasons had me
give up on Gentoo at home - net connectivity speed, and my CPU speed
(compiling Gnome 2.6 and KDE 3.2 took close to 3 weeks of continous
operation on my machine). Gentoo is simply not recommended for the
impatient (it might take several hours/days before you get gentoo
installed with all your favourite productivity tools). 

I moved back to Slackware 8.0 in 2002, and was impressed once again with
its consistency. Nothing really changed since the Slackware 2.0 days.
The installation screens, configuration files, package structure - all
remained the same. Even today, while I use Slackware 10, I feel most
comfortable for one of its greatest strengths - its simplicity.

So, it's probably just a preference of the guys who created it?

No guys there is a difference, when you execute bash as sh it acts slightly
different, please check the man page of bash more info.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0501232249370.2649@willy>


Hi all

Firstly, thanks AE dept for running this listserv. Though I wish it was CS
that took initiative. I am CS alumnus. :-)

I am trying to buy a reliance cell phone for my parents that I could use
to connect to internet. Can someone suggest what is a good reliance cell
phone for Linux? I was thinking of buying LG RD 5130.  But I am not sure
that it supports Linux. The Linux driver etc on the webpage has
directories only for the following phones:

GTRAN_GCP_4020  LG_LST_250  LG_RD_2230        SAMSUNG_SCH_A603
KYOCERA_7135    LG_RD_2030  LG_RD_7130        SAMSUNG_SCH_A663
LG_LSP_-340E    LG_RD_2130  SAMSUNG_SCH_A563  SAMSUNG_SCH_N191

So I am wondering if Reliance cell phone internet works only on above
phones. Can someone suggest me a good cell phone with speaker phone that
works in Linux for Internet.


baud rate:

Also, the reliance baud rate in the scripts is 115200 in all the models.

http://www.relianceinfo.com/Infocomm/pdf/rconnect-cmdline-1.0.tar

[20:12:28]opus::~/p/rim $ grep pppd --no-filename rconnect1.0/|grep port|
grep -v 115200
pppd $PORT connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -t 15 "" at+crm=1 OK'
[20:12:49]opus::~/p/rim $


Now, reliance advertises that the phone can support upto 144Kbps. (I
suppose this is bits and not bytes per second). Can someone tell me why
the two numbers (144Kbps and 115200)  can differ?  Also, is there a way I
can get faster Internet on a diff phone on Reliance? I would be willing to
pay money to get good internet in my small town.


What are the options to get on Internet for a small town guy?

Sudhakar.

PS:
<propaganda>
I really think that the govt should allow any company to use BSNL's
last mile infratructure. After all, BSNL is owned by the govt and is built
out of tax payers' money. It is unreasonable to expect someone to lay new
wires in small towns/rural areas. Me town boy will have to wait long for
internet. So no competetion in rural areas/small towns to BSNL. Which
means that we (small town people) will have to live with the lousy BSNL
for ages. My father is the boss of the BSNL phone exchange at my small
town. And I am still having trouble to get onto internet reliably.  What
about others?

India has a lot to learn from South Korea.  On another note, broadband
definition in India is 256Kbps.  In London, firms get sued because they
are advertising 512Kbps as broadband.  We have a long way to go! Atleast,
we are running. Nice to see that.

Dear sathish,
I just downloaded the kernel RPM from fedora update
site and just installed it.
I didnt customise nor compiled the kernel by myself.
And also I use gedit[editor],Kalarm,OOffice,.. till
gammu/gnokki[mobile PL USB cable driver].
Never did I experience any error.
One thing I have noticed is that if you shutdown
without disonnecting the net connection, it will throw
some kernel errors/outputs...
But, its not a problem... You can't make the eciadsl
modem driver work with the kernel that comes with
fedora core 2[ CD].

If any doubts please get clarified...

bye

Hi!
  
        I would like to share my experience of trying out distros
before I finally settled for  to 10gb FC1 and 30gb Debian ( Unstable )
( original, official debian i.e or however  you call it )

1.  FC1 - My first linux try out . Burnt the cd's myself and installed
with my friend who also was on the same lines as me. (both  know
nothing about linux at that time )
2. Knoppix - My very good friend Kumar Appaiah ( to whom I owe all my
knowledge of OSS and Linux, also a member of this group ). I made the
radical step of removing Windows totally from my system. It was
radical as said by my friends at that time.
3. Mandrake 10 - Really felt as if my hands had been tied up. Used it
only about six -seven times  and it was on my computer for 3 months
4. Mepis  ( Again Debian based ) - Really meant only for newbies. I
was really angry at this distro. I couldn't use lokkit to configure my
iptable. All my settings were being controlled from somewhere else and
I didn't know where. This is just one of the many pains that it caused
me.

             After all this I feel that a newbie should go for Fedora
Core distributions. It gives him the ease of a gui and also allows him
to get used to the linux way of doing things. People afresh from
W!n$&#s definitely cannot accept the debian installer. People would
feel the same way as if they are entering the BIOS setup ( which most
people (running  W!n$&#s) would be afraid to enter ). O.K Knoppix has
a much better installer . The Fedora installer ( Anaconda ) is a much
better when it comes to the ease of installing. Most people falter
only at the partitioning step and then it's a breeze even for a
newbie. I have also seen that most newbies are  always interested at
first in making their desktop look good rather than learn the
technicalities of linux and it's powerful features. ( I have been so
and I have installed it for a few of my friends who too have followed
similar lines ) It is unfair to expect a newbie not to be so. So


             Fedora Core --  My choice for newbies .


Bye!

hai ,

    When I tried to generate  random number for a
loadable kernel module I got the following errors

Unresolved  symbol time 
Unresolved  symbol rand 
Unresolved  symbol srand

program is like...
     
          srand((unsigned)time(NULL));
          printf("%6d",rand());
Could anybody give solutions about how to resolve
symbols for Fedora 3

As you  see above, "at+crm=1"  is the magic  word for LG  phones. Just
find  out  if  the  model  that  you are  looking  at  can  work  with
at+crm=1.  Also  note   that, for some weird reason,  these phones end
up dialing #777  or whatever no matter what is  the number you specify
in your dialing software. So  that means you cannot use another dialup
ISP. I use  an indicom connection (which I will  soon ditch) in favour
of the BSNL broadband.

The same goes  with even "city-boys" like me who  dont exactly stay at

Hi!
    I have still not understood the original problem. Today I have the
following distros on my system and have never faced a problem when it
comes to grub configuration.

1. Debian 30 GB
2. FC 1 10 GB
3. Win XP 10GB
4. Knoppix 10 GB ( Installed Debian recently will be removing it soon )

Bye!

Message-ID: <04ab01c501de$a6d54790$1f0110ac@sesco>

Hello List,
        I am wondering whether is it possible to build a product using only the 
static version of
it's dependency library by default. Normally when we compile any product, the 
compiler looks
for the shared version of it's dependency library. And when the shared version 
is not present,
it take the static version of the dependency product ( I use to fix this, by 
editing the configure
scipt sometime manually).

       My question is, Will it possible to tell the compiler to take only static 
dependency library by
default through some "flag values", when both static and shared version of the 
dependency libaries
are present. Is any better way out there.

      Also, I knew that using shared  dependent library will occupy less memory. 
But is there any
other valid reason to go with shared libraries. Can anyone in this list give me 
a detailed answer
on this issue.

If you would like to override the present libraries with the ones you have 
written, place the path in /etc/ld.so.preload and that should take a 
precedence over others which are in /etc/ld.so.conf

For more details look at : 
http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO.html

You should try a shared library when the program is likely to be used by 
more than one user on the same machine. That way it will be more efficient 
for the reasons known to you. More acceptance of your program. I guess 
that is a good incentive enough.

Sridhar, thanks for the pointer.

The tarred file can now be accessed from :
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/Image%3ABash_session1.tar.bz2.jpg

Looks like there are constraints to uploading.
Seems to accept only file with image file extensions.

So, I *cheated* by adding a ".jpg" extension
and uploaded my file.

Can't this constraint be removed ?

how to get processor time & usage in linux & windows

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0501232236510.2649@willy>



Hi all

Firstly, thanks AE dept for running this listserv. Though I wish it was CS
that took initiative. I am CS alumnus. :-)

I am trying to buy a reliance cell phone for my parents that I could use
to connect to internet. Can someone suggest what is a good reliance cell
phone for Linux? I was thinking of buying LG RD 5130.  But I am not sure
that it supports Linux. The Linux driver etc on the webpage has
directories only for the following phones:

GTRAN_GCP_4020  LG_LST_250  LG_RD_2230        SAMSUNG_SCH_A603
KYOCERA_7135    LG_RD_2030  LG_RD_7130        SAMSUNG_SCH_A663
LG_LSP_-340E    LG_RD_2130  SAMSUNG_SCH_A563  SAMSUNG_SCH_N191

So I am wondering if Reliance cell phone internet works only on above
phones. Can someone suggest me a good cell phone with speaker phone that
works in Linux for Internet.


baud rate:

Also, the reliance baud rate in the scripts is 115200 in all the models.

http://www.relianceinfo.com/Infocomm/pdf/rconnect-cmdline-1.0.tar

[20:12:28]opus::~/p/rim $ grep pppd --no-filename rconnect1.0/|grep port|
grep -v 115200
pppd $PORT connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -t 15 "" at+crm=1 OK'
[20:12:49]opus::~/p/rim $


Now, reliance advertises that the phone can support upto 144Kbps. (I
suppose this is bits and not bytes per second). Can someone tell me why
the two numbers (144Kbps and 115200)  can differ?  Also, is there a way I
can get faster Internet on a diff phone on Reliance? I would be willing to
pay money to get good internet in my small town.


What are the options to get on Internet for a small town guy?

Sudhakar.

PS:
<propaganda>
I really think that the govt should allow any company to use BSNL's
last mile infratructure. After all, BSNL is owned by the govt and is built
out of tax payers' money. It is unreasonable to expect someone to lay new
wires in small towns/rural areas. Me town boy will have to wait long for
internet. So no competetion in rural areas/small towns to BSNL. Which
means that we (small town people) will have to live with the lousy BSNL
for ages. My father is the boss of the BSNL phone exchange at my small
town. And I am still having trouble to get onto internet reliably.  What
about others?

India has a lot to learn from South Korea.  On another note, broadband
definition in India is 256Kbps.  In London, firms get sued because they
are advertising 512Kbps as broadband.  We have a long way to go! Atleast,
we are running. Nice to see that.

Hi,

You could try the time command in UNIX.
Read `man time`

Also /proc/cpuinfo for general CPU related information.

This is Not supposed to be here but here goes :)
In windows, ctrl + alt + Del (Win NT) will give you the task manager,
Select the proceses tab and you will get the CPU time and usage for each

Process.

HTH.

Toufeeq Hussain

One's choice always depend on what he want to learn and availability of CD. 

If he is looking at using GUI based desktop applications he should go
for FC3 or Mandrake 10.1 or Ubuntu. If trying to master command line
and server applications go for a server class installation of any
distro. If want to become a developer(C/C++/TCL/Python) use any distro
which offer these tools.

Only after learning the basics one can go for linuxfromscratch and such things. 

   If he have any book in hand to learn Linux use the distro which is
used in that book.

   I studied linux at a training centre. It was no matter to me which
distro it is. They were using RHL 7.0. My goal of learning linux was
to know something that others dont know. But soon I fall in love with
linux. Then I bought PC and I was in a position to try out different
distros. First I installed Caldera Linux which I got along with
PCQuest. Then tried various RHL versions, Knoppix Live CD and Ubuntu.

    Now I have two objective in learning and using Linux. 
1) It should help my career.
2) For my personal joy of learning linux.

    For the first objective I learn to use RedHat flavor (RHL and
mandrake). For the second I try out various Linux distros(and
different versions) of Linux distros.

Hi,
       For Linux, in addition to /proc/cpuinfo (which has predominantly 
hardware informations) we can use
     /proc/stat to get individual and overall processor(s)  
system/idle/user/nice time.

Importantly, it allows you to improve on the library (provided there
is binary compatibility) independent of the clients (the programs).

hey ppl...I guess you left that newcomer more confused than
before...It's important that we leave our differences alone and
present him with one good solution - need not be the best (I know that
we will never agree on that :))

hmmm... why not have a poll...does mailman have some infrastructure
for that, like many web based list servers do...

Then do NOT use wiki for uploading files other than Images.  Ask
bharathi to upload the file to chennailug and link to that file in
wiki.

You want to get not only the distro, but even the CD's free ?

Okay, go to www.ubuntulinux.org ask for free CD's and wait for a month.
                (or)
contact the participants in ILUGC  who will get you the CD's whatever distro
you want burnt for you  if you go with blank CD's at convenient timings

I have already ordered and received about 20 Ubuntu CDs.  I still have
many left.  Get it from me (free of cost) instead of ordering again.

Hi Sridhar,

I agree allowing non-image uploads will lead to abuse
but .bz2 or .gz should be exemptions.

For MediaWiki, you need to edit the includes/DefaultSettings.php
and add bz2, gz to $wgFileExtensions so that it becomes
something like..

$wgFileExtensions = array( 'png', 'gif', 'jpg', 'bz2', 'gz' );


Regards
Kumaraguru

Hey, in case you hadn't noticed, the linux-india.org site is slowly coming
back to its feet.  Where're some statistics, followed by requests and
finally some dos and don'ts:

STATISTICS
==========

Users:  We have 68 registered users now.  I don't know who you are, but
thank you for registering and trying things out.

LUGs: We have 6 LUGs/GUGs/FSUGs/GLUGs registered.  More entries welcome. The 
LUG list is at:

   http://linux-india.org/index.pl?iid=2198

TODOS
=====

1. Please learn how to use the portal.  MetaDot is an extremely powerful
online portal, and you can do incredible things with it without once having
to (a) leave your browser or (b) have administrative rights on the site. You 
can add all sorts of interesting stuff (RSS feeds, formatted HTML, JS,
FAQs, News items, forms, polls, etc.) to your own site, and you can have
multiple pages within your site.

1. If you're a LUG, please send me your entry.

If you don't already have a web site you can create an account and your
complete web site within your account on linux-india.org itself.

If you already have a site, please do create an account and at least a
single page in your account that summarises your LUG.  Send me the account
information and I'll link your page to the main LUG page.

2. If you're a user, please create an account and populate your site. If you
feel your site is of general interest, please send me your user ID and I'll
be happy to link to your site from the Users' Pages section.  Let's get some
content on!

3. If you're a well-wisher with 1/2 hour per day to spare, please handle one
or more of these sections:

   News
   Press Releases
   Job Postings
   Job Requests
   Events

You will become the contact point for that section and you will have full
administrative rights within your section.  More than one person can share
the load of handling one section -- it's group-based.

I'm currently handling the security section.  However I'd be glad to hand
that over to someone else if anyone wants it.  Another alternative would be
to hand it over to one of the Linux Security News RSS feeds.

4. Keep the feedback flowing in.  Suggestions on how to improve the site,
useful new sections, etc. are welcome.

DOS AND DON'TS
==============

Please DO look at the site, figure out how to use the system and add
content.

Please DO NOT add content that is not Linux- or FLOSS-related.  Of course,
you can add whatever interests you in your personal page (e.g. I have
received a request for a Tsunami Relief page), but try to stay at least
loosely on topic :)

Please DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT add any content that violates the
laws of India or any other country.  CD images or activation keys of Winduhs
XP Home Edition are completely ruled out, as is pornographic material, links
to not-free-to-copy materials on the 'net, etc.

Please DO NOT send me feedback about how the site design sucks, how the
colour scheme looks ghastly, etc.  If you are willing to add content, please
go ahead and do it.  If you are only coming up with alternative suggestions
on portal systems to use, forget it -- I have done the best within the
constraints that are available to me and I'm not really interested in
looking at or evaluating 1000s of other portal systems.  Each person has her
own favourite and I really can't keep up with the gazillions of portal
systems that are released each month.

Done. Now you can upload .bz2 and .gz files.

Hariram, re-upload the file (deleting the old one)

Hi,

I re-uploaded the file as  Bash_session1.tar.bz2 
and modified the Bash_session1 page to link to it.
see:
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/Bash_session1

Only admins can delete the already uploaded file
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/Image:Bash_session1.tar.bz2.jpg
So it's you who have to delete it.

Regards
Kumaraguru

We can't force any to take the responsibilities. It is purely an
volunteer task. So It is noting to do with CS or AE or ME :). But I
feel, for list-admin task, IIT guys are best choice. Bcoz they have
physical access to the server.

Anyway We should NOT discusses abt, Why someone is not willing to take

I have Ubuntu (10 CD). I am planning to distribute it among my co
workers and friends after experimenting with it since I am new to a
Debian flavour.

After getting Ubuntu I got the idea of getting CDs shipped to my
address as it is very convenient.

One Day One Command :-
-------------------

touch - Change File Timestamps

Summary : 

Update the access and modification times of each 
FILE to the current time.

Examples :

$ touch myfile -- change the time stamp to current time.
                  If myfile is not there then touch will 
                  create it.

$ touch -c myfile -- Same as above. But If myfile is not
                     there, then it won't create it.

$ touch -r f1 f2 -- Set f1's time to f2 instead of current time

$ touch -a myfile -- Change only access time.

$ touch -m myfile -- change only the modification time

$ touch -t 200412251122.33 -- set this time instead of current time

$ ls -lu myfile -- Shows the last access time

Read : man touch

sh is a part of the POSIX standard.  Bash is backwards compatible with sh and
provides POSIX compliant sh like syntax/behaviour.  And since it's the default
on several linux distros, it naturally plays a dual role as sh.

If you install the "dash" package on debian sarge, your sh will be
symlinked to dash instead.

People who link sh to csh, ksh, etc. are all asking for trouble.

My suggestion is that we should have our ilugc meets
after the GLV sessions, _every_ week. With the rapid
developments in the GNU/Linux/OSS community we need to
meet often. Once a month is too big a gap.

Once a week is too short a gap.
Its good for GLV as the spontaneity is maintained but I doubt everyone
from ILUGC can make it every week.

It would be good though, if the seniors are present every week.
I could also be asking for too much here.. :)

I have a pack of Ubuntu CD. Which has Live CD & a install CD. I want
to show my friends a taste of linux. So decided to place the live CD &
show them how it is. When i placed the cd on the drive, booted into
it. The booting was successfull. The Ubuntu page(page that displays a
big ubuntu logo) Display came by. And then a black screen, waited for
some time but no progress. Thought that system crashed, but decided to
wait. As nothing happened for 10 min. I decided to switch off. The PC
switch didn't work(as expected), so switched off power cord switch.
The machine i tried ubuntu was windows XP only box, Athalon xp 1.8GHz,
256 MB RAM. But it did work on my linux box with intel 500MHz, 256 MB
RAM. Could somebody explain what is causing the trouble.

Thank you,

Guess the homepage needs frequent updation. Even if we dont meet
often, the homepage can be updated regularly. Hope the Drupal version
comes out of Beta!!!

Hi

That looks like an Internet Explorer Specific problem.
Probably something with the javascript code for IE.

Works quite nicely in Firefox.

Hi,

    The reliance phone is connected to the PC via a serial cable and
via a USB cable. I have worked on interfacing the reliance phone with
a Linux Point of Sale terminal, once you have a modem device detected
on linux the reliance script is just used to point the ppp to the
device detected(a symb link) . In short you just use his scripts for
connecting via PPP, the drivers for usb are usbserial,ftdi_sio(depends
on your serial-usb converter , mostly the ones available in ritchie's
/ reliance dealers are ftdi). Most of the kernels have the ftdi driver
in their source or alternatively you could download the source from
the ftdi site.You would not need a driver for the serial cable.

The at+crm= is used to specify between FWT and Handsets as far as i
know, they are all there in the scripts.You could just figure out what
he is doing by just looking at his script.It has been quite some time
since i worked on it.

I had some problems in an embedded kernel where the reliance server
autheticated me with a Local RAP (Reliance Application Platform) IP
(when i used his scripts).I had to goto DAKC (Reliance HQ) and found
out the CHAP/PAP was not autheticating me.If anyone gets into such a
problem use  -f option and specify your password filename in pppd.It
should work.

The 114kbps he promises is just another Sales slicker.Your serial port
would support 115200 , but dont even think of going beyond 10 kpbs
(even that if you are damn lucky) .

You could also look here for more details, 

http://www.hackgnu.org/ril-howto.html

this is where i started off from a year back.

Cheers,

Bharath.G

Check if hotplug is installed ,dpkg -l hotplug .
If not do a apt-get install hotplug, as root.

Subject: [Ilugc] Media WIKI + PHP upload limit
Message-ID: <m3fz0plgdz.fsf@rajsekar.pc>


I run a Wiki page on my comp (just for fun).
I tried uploading an ogg file (around 4MB).  It said that the file is
empty.  I assumed that this has to with mediawiki and hacked around
include/SpecialUpload.php

I found that it wasn't really mediawiki that was causing trouble.  The size
that it gets from php itself seems to be zero. I checked this by making it
output (as reply) the size it gets.

Now I found that some php variables like upload_max_size, post_max_size,
memory_limit need to be adjusted to take big uploads.  I changed my
conf.d/php.conf (included by httpd.conf) and still am not able to upload
big files.

Can someone help me on this issue?

I have pasted my php.conf

This is my php.conf

Merge with GLV.
The Python Group can meet monthly after the GLV
session.
This could be on the third saturday of every month.

This will also lead to more LUG activity and variety.

Hi,

Well, I am not sure how many of those in the Python group
Can particpate in the meetup on a Saturday. I myself can
come only on sundays. I'll talk to the members and see
everybody agrees to it. If we could meet at IIT then it's
well and good.

Kumaraguru

(On a lighter note, How about a meeting at the *Snake* Park?
  You know..it's a *Python* meetup :-))

Does a group already exist ?
Is it the one created by Sridhar online ?
If so, I think most of those members are ILUGC members
also.
The problem with Sunday is that it's supposed to be a
"all-family-day" for most of the people.

Sunday, the IIT offices are closed. So, we will not be
able to make use of the facility. I would always
prefer  a Sunday, as work comes along on Saturdays. We
also should look out for other places with projectors.

Good one :)

It will be of great use if Python gurus can start of
some tutorial sessions, part of GLV. We shall discuss
this soon.

Visit tldp.org, it's the Linux Documentation Project.
It has HOWTO's for almost any linux related query.

The best way would be to select a topic of your
interest and pick up a HOWTO from the list.

The best thing to start off would be BASH, the Linux
shell (command line).

Also of interest is www.google.com/linux , here you
can search for linux related problems etc.

Have fun with GNU/Linux,

tldp.org is a huge repository. Use google.com (or any
other search engine) for your searches.

This is a good resource:

Dear friends,
I am at present using fedora core 2 .I use XFCE. I
like working in Fedora but, it is too slow when
compared to winXP running on the same box.
I am thinking of moving to a distro that will be as

Is it true that MDK 10 is faster than fedora...

And I am not sure that my modem driver[USB eciadsl]

Or Arch Linux, Gentoo, Sourcemage or something of that type too...

I can help you. PL give details of hardware ?

Are you planning to use old systems like PI and PII. In that case you 
can go in for LTSP as the node can works as fast as server, but in this 
case server need to be a latest system with lot of RAM.

Going to tldp.org and just reading random howtos is ineffective imho.
Instead, try to learn new things as you use Linux on a day-to-day
basis. Like you said, how to access windows partitions. Look up tldp,
search google for this particular topic. You'll find answers to your
questions and also learn some other interesting things along the way.

Tomorrow, you'll want to play mp3 files. More task based learning :-)

other software users and developers to read.

For the busy bees who cannot spare more than 10 or 15 mins:

I dont know whether the link has already been there in the mailing

whether it is already in the list. When I searched for "microsoft",
it(google through ilugc web site) returned 7 results.
I could not find the above topic or link.

Is there any way to find whether any topic had already been
discussed in the list from the mail archives.?

Hi,

If you google

"site:ae.iitm.ac.in  microsoft" (without the quotes)

you can get all the messages containing microsoft
in the ILUGC archives.

If you want to include messages forwarded to other
mailing lists and the replies to them.

"intitle:[ilugc] microsoft"

But this covers only pages indexed by Google.
If you need a live Search(to include even the messages
posted a few minutes before) you can use

http://search.gmane.org/search.php?group=gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

But it doesn't seem to include last year's messages
in its search and gmane is very slow. If your browser is
Firefox, you can make it a little easier. See..

Seen the site. Lot of pages have title "New Page 1". I guess the web 
developer forgot to change the default title that was given by 
Macromedia Dreamweaver/Microsoft Frontpage ;-) [Just kidding].

PS: BTW, it would be nice if you avoid CCing multiple mailing lists. 
"Reply all" is painful :-)

Hi,

I initially thought praveen was cracking a
bad joke but he is not.

>From the source of
http://www.swatantra.info/schedule.htm

--- snip ---

<style fprolloverstyle>A:hover {color: #808080}
</style>

--- snip ---

fprolloverstyle is the name of the class used by
Front Page for rollover effects.

We don't actually have to mind this but I am surprised
to see it on a FSF site.

Regards
Kumaraguru

The best part was: 

Only 32 kilobytes of RAM in the Apollo capsules' computers was enough to
put men on the moon. The Voyager deep space probes have on-board computers
based on a 4-bit CPU. An 80C85 CPU with 176 kilobytes of PROM and 576
kilobytes of RAM controlled the Sojourner rover that drove across the
surface of Mars and sent us a wealth of scientific data and high-resolution
images in full-color stereo. But when I have a 233MHz Pentium II with 128
Megabytes of RAM and 30 Gigabytes of disk space, and I try to type a letter
to my grandmother using Windows XP and Office XP, the job will take me
forever because my computer is underpowered!!

ET's software stories Indian business daily, 'The Economic Times', has this
link for software-related stories. Unfortunately just a few related to
Free/Libre and Open Source Software in India ... a field where so much is
happening!

C-DAC launches Janabhaaratii FLOSS localisation project C-DAC, the Indian
government-run Centre for the Development of Advanced Computing, has
announced in October 2004 the launch of the launch of its "janabhaaratii"
project for localisation of FLOSS. It suggested the goal would be
"development, deployment and community building, and the work would be put
out under the GPL/LGPL licenses.

Govt open to open source software ... or just hedging bets?  India's
business newspaper reported in end-December 2004 that the Government of
India "continues to evaluate options for using open source software, a move
which would proliferate the usage of IT by bringing down its costs". IT
secretary Brijesh Kumar was quoted as telling the Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce and Industry, an industry lobby group, that the
"government continues to consider options available in open source
software". There was a suggestion that "India should force proprietory
software makers to share source code by threatening to shift to open source
software", the ET reported, citing the case of China.

wow !
well....my heartburn for quite some time...I just can't use Anjuta for
all its features, cause it's no match for the editing capabilities of
emacs....how I wish emacs had a bonobo wrapper...(I know you are
rotfl...but I have a right to dream :))

ede is actually quite good...(if you haven't heard about this... check
out http://cedet.sourceforge.net ... cedet includes ede - cedet is the
most ambitious emacs based project I have seen so far...in fact, w3 is
no match)...but expecting glade like functionality is a bit too
much...

it moves on...

please check your configuration well before changing the distribution
- most often the config is the problem rather than the distro - may be
you have unnecessary servers running....choice of applications also
matter - gnome/kde apps tend to be bloated - e.g. xterm is much better
and faster than gnome-terminal sans the backgrounds - maybe aterm if
you really insist on the backgrounds...changing distros may not really
help...

it moves on...

Slackware wins hands down when it comes to Linux Distributions on "old"
PC's.
I had a slackware 8.0 installtion on my old P166 with 64 MB RAM.

Worked out real good for me.

Hi,

Wiki model is meant to be open to everyone. I believe that if some
unwanted editing happens oldstate could be restored easily. I am not
very sure about the method for resoration but this is bulit into Wiki.
Its possible to block specific IP from accessing wiki if we have
issues.

These two links answers most of the questions.

If someone using dialup is making harmful changes then what kind
of life will that person be having ?? most problem will come from a
broadband user which still uses dynamic IP only but if there are
issues offending people can be easily traced back.

If the problem araises then we can think about restricting access.
until then we can try it as free for all.

but the issue we will really face is Flame wars on distros and applications !!

Yes, there must be a SysOp or maybe more. Then only illegal uploads

In general,

* The society is not bad enough (assumption 1).
* There are enough good people to revert back. (assumption 2).

I think, all we need is many sysops.  We can decide (in this thread itself
IMHO) who all would be sysops.  sysops have more previls. 

In the worst case (if assumption 1 fails), we can restrict editing to only
registered users (free registration implies that no freedom is removed) and
deleting an account can be done much faster than creating an account.

Recent events shows that, We should not give even a single chance for 
such actions.

Initially, Myself and Sridhar discussed this things, then only sridhar
open this wiki to all. But (after seeing the uploads of GLV slides),
later, I started thinking abt this.

We need more moderators. Any volunteers ??

Heh.  You, of all people, need no help to install Debian, man.  The
only tip I can give you is - avoid dselect like the plague.  You can
install debian without getting anywhere near it.

I like Debian not because of dselect, but inspite of it.  I have made
two major upgrades first from potato -> woody and then from woody ->
Testing (distributed by PC Quest).  Not a hitch ( Well, discounting a
hard disk crash in the interim) ...  Now, what was that recommeded
upgrade path from FC1 again ? :-)

It should be possible to block porn things from getting posted ONLY if
it is routed through the moderator. ie the moderator evaluates the
content and then see if it is apt to be put it in.. Is it the case
with wiki s??

No. Such thing is not possible with wiki. The contest gets posted
first and then only the SysOp can decide whether to delete the picture
or not.
But ordinary users can edit the content and delete the tag containing
the image. Also the user can message the SysOp about the illegal
content and ask it to be removed.
This is the best thing to do.

Ages ago (maybe in 2000), when I was a quasi-active participant of
ILUGC, I tried getting ILUGC to either shift or come down once in a
while to my office (HCL Technologies Ltd) on Nelson Manickam Road
(Aminijikarai) so that it'd be easier for people from that end of the
world to commute easily, amidst several other reasons. However that
didn't work for a variety of reasons then.

At that point of time, I left an open ended note saying that if ever
ILUGC wanted such a service/facility ever in the future, our doors could
probably be pried open once more. _Now_, if there is an interest/need in
such a location once again, I can try and talk to the relevant
authorities to see if it can be made possible once again.

What do you folks think ?

Cheers,
Sudhir.P

I'm just wondering. Supposing, you were stuck with a plain old
text console.., how will you develop using Anjuta/Glade/`any other
gui based ide`. ?? Emacs was not originally build for
GUI. However, they added that because GUI became popular. But the
main motive was to retain the basic functionality when running in
both console and on the X.

Anjuta is a good IDE alright., but comparing it with Emacs is not
proving a point. Emacs has tonnes of features which are not even
imaginable with Anjuta/Glade/*. The main thing that Emacs users
love (atleast me) is that, it provides integration with all your
day to day work. Emacs is _not_ an IDE. It can be used as an
IDE. And it does do a pretty good job at it too. 

You got to use Emacs to really get the feel of it.

Subject: Announcing Ubuntu LoCo Teams
To: ubuntu-announce@lists.ubuntu.com


Greetings,

Many people ask for ways that they can give back to the Ubuntu project
or participate in the community. One great way to do this is through
promote Ubuntu in your local community!

To help with this, we are pleased to announce the creation of Local
Community Teams (LoCo Teams) to promote the use, adoption, and
localization of Ubuntu.

Ubuntu's philosophy states that:

 Every computer user should be able to use their software in the
 language of their choice.

This means that we need advocacy, promotion, documentation, support,
and (of course) translations of Ubuntu, in individual languages.
It also means a geographically distributed user community for
coordinated promotion. LoCo Teams can help tackle all of these problems.

If you are interested in getting involved in a LoCo Team (or starting
your own), we can go ahead and learn more at:

  http://www.ubuntulinux.org/LoCoTeams

We have set up a common set of domain names in the form of
ubuntu-CC.org [*]. Most of those domains are just placeholder domains,
waiting for someone to come along and take control. That could be you!

In other cases, there are already folks working on Ubuntu in a
location, country, area, or language. We will happily point
ubuntu-CC.org to those web sites and your mailing lists.

Please don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions or would
like to get involved!

Regards,
Matthias

[*] CC stands for "country code" -- the last two letters on
    country-specific URLs. If necessary, we can also create other
    domains for communities which don't easily associate with a country
    or language.

well...we will have to trust people...no other go...but the risk is
there...it may not matter whether the pic gets deleted or not...if you
are unfortunate enough to open the website in that small amount of
time, I guess it would be tough to convince people that it was a wiki
site, and some moron posted it, and you got to see it before the SysOp
could delete it :)

it moves on...

I *didn't* wish to start a flame war, but sridhar is forcing me in :)
exactly joe...anjuta is hardly comparable to emacs...and it all
depends on what you exactly mean by an IDE...the most versatile
programmer friendly editing features, a far superior highlighting
system, and cedet to extend all this, apart from innumerable other
features...emacs is THE best IDE (if IDE means an environment
conducive for coding - cmon, writing glade apps isn't the only thing a
programmer does...)....

all said, I guess your wiki has most of my wishes over there...now,
how to bring that to the notice of the emacs developers ???

it moves on...

PS: Hmm...if I was loud above, it's just my passion for what I call
the editing environment (it is just not an editor)...

Totally agree with you.  But emacs needs to do _that_ IDE job more
pretty well (in well architectured manner, instead buffer hacks), as I
said in my earlier mail.

I am using emacs for _only_ editing purposes.

If emacs can do everything (gnus, erc,..) why cannot it do glade?

I never bothered after starting that wiki page. May be some one should
post it in the emacs-devel list.  And btw, emacs cvs has gtk2 support
which is still not well architectured.  Gtk2 is only used for the
menus, scrollbars, .. The buffer is still the same old emacs buffer
(no anti-aliased fonts).  Extensions like tabbar.el (for eg.) could
make use of GtkNotebook if emacs was made extensible with the toolkit
(rather than just the menus).  No more buffer hacking then.

well...it can almost do everything...nothing is perfect right
???...talking about the gtk frontend, it should mean an architectural
change - as far as fonts are concerned, not everyone might need it -
atleast for me, fixed fonts are perfectly fine...that's why I thought
a n orbit wrapper might be an easier job - to begin with, a server to
just expose the interpreter  along with the embedding part of it
should do wonders (gnuserv is a hack)...

Subject: [Ilugc] GUI based HDD install  ????? - FC3
Message-ID: <20050128053517.45206.qmail@web54107.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

Iam using FC3 ISOs from the Digit Jan issue for
instalation..

My system is an AMD Sempron 2400+

I am getting Graphical instalation even when i install
from ISOs 
from the Hard Disk.

Up to my knoledge Only text based installation is
available when
installing from HDD.

with the same ISOs i got only Text install in my older
P3 866.
My old P3 supported GUI installations only from
CD..(For all previous RH Distros)

I thought all i386 compatible systems behaved basicaly
in the 
same way, with respect to instalation.

How does this happen...

Thanks

Easwaran.K.V

Hmm.. I dont exactly understand what you mean by buffer
hacks. Thats how Emacs works. There are no hacks in it. They chose
to keep everything as buffers so that it is easy to extend
it. Even the cutomize widgets are basically text inside the
buffer. Just to make them look pretty on X, they've some widgets
here and there.. But still, the point is to keep it simple.

Ok., I'm going to be biased again. I've never used Glade. I do
program a bit of GTK+, but again only in Emacs. Usually one of my
friends does the packing of widgets. He uses Glade for that. But
once the code gen is done, he copies the code into the project and
uses good ol` Emacs to continue with it. 

I find Emacs more comfortable than using glade. I'm used to
writing my own autotools based build system., so I find the build
system given by Glade as cumbersome..

The  code-generation   is  just  one   aspect  of  GLADE.    The  most
advantageous thing with glade is  the GladeXML library where you don't
have to bother  with how to place the widgets and  where _in_ the Code
but instead use Glade to "build" the UI, generate the XML and ask your
Gtk app to use the XML file. You can even assign actions to call backs
and things like that with the GladeXML.

I've been programming in C for nearly 4 years now.. I find the
Emacs indendation a lot better than Vi indentation
(IMHO). Personally I like it because, I nest a lot of code into
`if` clauses or `for` loops and still they fit beautifully into
the 80 column console.

I have tried out the 8spaces indenting recommended in the Linux
kernel, and various other styles.. (even camelcase). But
personally I dont find the code that readable as in Emacs
indenting. However, this is purely a personal choice and a project
policy rather than a point of debate of efficiency. All that
matters is consistency throughout the project

Hmm., interesting I did not come across this before. However, is
this a part of libglade? And is libglade portable across to w32?

Yep, its  part of  LibGlade. I dont  know about the  win32 portability
part. (sridhar  has sent  a link in  a different  sub-thread, probably
that explains it).

The good thing with libglade is  that you can 'theme' your app without
having to even make _any_ modifications in the Code.

It is still an improvement over the old look of emacs .. but I dont think a gtk
enabled emacs is going to take off anytime soon. That gtk2 support is an old
and fairly crude hack that's been around for ages.

Subject: [Ilugc] Query on Network Status
Message-ID: <006d01c50520$6ee6f7d0$511e0a0a@Heaven>

Hi All,

Is there any way in Linux to determine Ethernet Port status like network disconnection. One can use ping, but I can't assure whether the failure is due to network disconnection.

Is there any other option like continuously tracing a particular signal on the LAN port and getting info whenever it is disconnected etc. Are there any entries in Proc to see such infos

regards,
Ganesh S

Subject: [Ilugc] DNS reverse lookups on Reliance and  BSNL
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0501280838470.11067@tux>


Hi all,


	How are Reliance and BSNL as far as reverse lookups are concerned?
Does they do a good job of their DNS server?  Do reverse lookup give a
good entry so that it is consistent with forward lookup entry?

	To me it it important because our dept servers accept incoming ssh
only if the reverse lookup is good.  I know that some people can run into
problems like this with bad revsese lookup:

	"I had problems with this many times, including issues like email
tagged as SPAM because reverse lookup turned blank, inability to edit
certain wiki sites as they check reverse lookup, etc.."


How is the tech support usually?


Comments?

There is a program that dumps the GladeXML from a 'running' Gtk+

I think you're SOL about rDNS .. dishnet dsl seems to have implemented 
rDNS across their network just now.

Satyam dialups and VSNL dialups do have rDNS.

First clue to get better performance is - pretend you're running 
windows, pretend to reboot your PC etc etc :)

If your NIC supports the MII standard (most modern NICs do), then you
can just run the "mii-tool" program to figure out the link status.

We should thank Bharathi and IIT-M for organising and making the event 
possible.

Some more details:-
HOWTO Reach the Central Lecture Theater (CLT):-
[Courtesy: Bharathi <sbharathi@MidasComm.Com>]
---------------------------------------------
Reaching CLT is very easy. Bcoz it is opposite to Open Air Theater (OAT).

1) Enter thru Main Gate.
2) Reach the Gajanthra Circle (GC) (~2KM)

3) Take the Hostel Road.

4) CLT is 100 meter away from the GC. On the road, you can see Central
  Library & OAT in Left side and Admin block on Right side

Thanks,
Ramanraj.

I really did not like tone of your message. May be you have not read
what wiki is all about ??
In wiki moderation should exception rather than rule. 

Moderation should be only be used against uploading or linking illegal
or pronographic materials.

It seems Mr.Bharathi is much concerned about misuse in one of his
earlier mail. I know its a valid concern. If the community is not
comfortable with wiki we need not employ it. But moderating content of
wiki is not a acceptable practice. I hope this not intended. Please
clarify on this.
If content moderation has to imposed then there are zillions of other
CMS available we need not bother with wiki.

Agreed. So far excessive moderation to try and keep emails posted to the list
ontopic hasn't worked anywhere it has been tried (well, some people think it
works but they're wrong and all they do is irritate valuable contributors to
the list)

Ideology / differences in opinion on what constitutes linux shouldnt be made
into an issue on the wiki for example.

Message-ID: <20050129065104.763381DB25F@www.ae.iitm.ac.in>

Hi

I am on Fedora Core 3. I followed the instruction on
http://www.aero.iitm.ernet.in/pipermail/ilugc/2004-October/013328.html
However i Still seem to be having problems. The modem I am having is the
TeraGate U100 (GlobeSpan ADSL USB modem). I got this from my ISP Airtel.

When I run startmodem, the following output is printed on screen. Please
help. Is this a problem with my Modem or of my configuration? However, the
modem works fine on Windows XP. Moreover. When I probe my modem. The VID1
settings is shown as 0f70 rather than the 0915 shown in the above link. Will
this setting change from build to build?

The Moderators were required to prevent ilegal files
from being posted to the wiki, but why do you need 4
moderators for that ?

The current total now is 6 (!)

All moderators please focus on the uploaded files/hack
attacks, rather than trying to filter the content
being put up.

"If you break it, you get to keep both the pieces"

You might find some commercial applications that
provide this.However the safest "system restore" would
be to have separate partitions [/usr , /home , /boot
], so that if something goes wrong you'll not be left
completely stranded. In this way you can backup the
important partitions (/usr ..).

                             and store in "myoutput"

$ sort -b myfile -- Ignore the leading blanks and sort.

$ sort -br myfile -- Same as above but in reverse order

                    sorted

$ sort -f myfile -- Ignore the case and sort (a == A)

$ sort -u myfile -- Sort and output only unique lines

$ sort -t : -k 2,2n -k 5.3,5.4 myfile 
     
     -- Sort numerically on the 2nd field and resolve 
        ties by sorting alphabetically on the 3rd and

You can just run tar and feather on any partition you want to back up and use 
a livecd to restore... ;)

oh people, try to categorize the wiki pages. (There is no mention of
GLV in your Bash Session2 page and now you get the idea) Learn how
wikipedia categorizes the articles.

The dicussion was the most interesting part. I'd really appreciate it
if you "throw the floor open" after every session, just like you did

Hi,

I am  looking for a very  very light weight CMS  with  installed 
footprint to be around 3Mb or so. Prime usage would be in  using
it as a portal. Should be good (read decent) looking. LAMP based.

Any pointers ?

But I dont like the 1 GB cap the connection has. If the limit is about
10GB (or atleast 7GB) then BSNL would have more people getting the
connection

Yes. 6 moderators is too much for the current size of the wiki. But as
the wiki grows we may need more SysOps.

Yes. That is the job of the SysOps. The content can be edited by any
user(if there are any objectionable content). But regarding the file
uploads, only the SysOps can delete the illegal uploads.
I see that the Bash_session1.tar.bz2.jpg file is still present on the
wiki. Someone(Sridhar ot Toufeeq) delete it ASAP as we still are not
SysOps.

Great! I got an e-mail from them stating that I must approach a nearby
center and fill up an application form (hard copy) and make the initial
payment for spot-booking. Assuming that you went through this process,
how long did it take for the connection to arrive ?

As you have seen, you will get a variety of advise from different users,
all trying to make it easy for you.
One suggestion could be : Try the one you get your hands on first and
once you get a little used to it (unless you want to try many of them -
one after the other in the first 2 weeks), try another one to see the
variety.
Gradually, you will get sued to the one that you find most convenient
for you and that's the one good for you.
All of them will surely give you a lot of learning and enjoyment.
Get back to the list to clarify your doubts/issues while trying them and
friends will help you.

All the best.

I heard the thing has no data limit till June.. Probably they are
trying to figure out the maximum demand.

Real Networks has a suite of applications for creating, streaming,
viewing live or recorded audio and video.  The journey starts at -
    https://www.helixcommunity.org

But be warned, content streaming by itself is complex technology.
There is no easy way out.

I am not sure what issue you are facing in your Linux installation. If
u can be specific about the problem may be we can try and help you.
You can always learn more by troubleshooting the present problem than
doing fresh install. If you want to do Kernel recompilation the u will
need kernel sources. which will be there in /usr/src .

> if anyone has the cd please mail me ur contact info.

http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/CDs_for_Grab

You can go far RH9 or FC1 both 2.4 Kernel based Distro.

I have suggestion that the link to CD for Grabs can be add to
singnature of all emails. It might be very useful.

Greetings!

This is a confirmation and announcement of the
February 5, 2005 (Saturday) session (part of GNU/Linux
Vidyashram) by Anand Babu on "Introduction to Hacking
GNU/Hurd" at CSD#320, Electrical Sciences Block, IIT-M
at 1300 HRS IST.

You can view the poster from here:

http://www.geocities.com/cyborg4k/anandbabu.feb.5.2005.pdf

Please note that the session starts at 1300 HRS IST.
We have advanced the timing because Anand Babu, Joe,
Ramaraj will have to receive Richard Stallman and have
to travel to Vellore for February 6, 2005 Swatantra at
VIT.

A brief introduction about Anand Babu:

Anand Babu is a very active Free Software developer
and a full time GNU Volunteer. He is the
author/maintainer for various Free Software projects
like FreeIPMI
System, HDB/RPCI, Hymn, Freehoo, bios-config... He
leads the Free Software Division of California Digital
as Chief Software Architect and VP, and built world's
second fastest super-computer (code named Thunder). He
had given us a lecture earlier in June of 2004 about
Thunder and FreeIPMI.

Oops...definitely need some sleep. Thanks for pointing
out Suresh.

Please post the output of:

ls /usr/src

If you have already installed the kernel during
installation, you can probably query that using:

rpm -q kernel

Dear Boovarahan,
Is it true that you have deleted your partitions using
fdisk.Then how you are able to boot into linux.
My question is at present what is the structure of
your partitions...
Have you created the same partition structure as:

Initially I had XP in /dev/hda1.
 5 GB space was free in /dev/hda3
 /dev/hda4 was 500 MB swap.
 /dev/had/5 was mandrake 10.1
 /dev/hda6 was swap 500MB.
/dev/hda7 was home directory.
 /dev/hda8 wad usr directory.


Or else if you have deleted those /dev/hda5 and 
/dev/hda6 /dev/hda7 and /dev/hda8 you have to
reinstall mandrake again.Moreover ME is the most
crappy OS that MS has produced.I prefer XP[enable XP's
default firewall to get rid most viruses and attacks].

I have also played with OSes and partitions but I had
backedup -MBR,partition table and my important
datas...

My advice is that you partition you disk from scratch
and reinstall in the order XP,Mandrake...
And install MDK grub boot loader in  the dedicated
partition[/ or /boot based on your choice of
installation].
Later install XOSL...

Your BIOS battery is dying. Replace it.

I think Windows syncs with time.microsoft.com without telling you
(calling home?). Maybe you should put the command:

ntpdate -b clock.isc.org

in your crontab or something.

About 10 pounds?  Compare the cost of a monthly broadband connection in 
the UK / the USA, with what you get in India for a similar offering.

And compare it in terms of a percentage of UK / US salaries if you want 
more information

I dont know .. I am totally sober and yet I am seeing things .. like 
someone praising BSNL as one of the best providers in the world.  That 
is so strange .. even seeing pink elephants asking me for a debian CD 
would be an improvement on this.

As others have pointed out it might problem with BIOS battery.

If thats the case then then it might not be problem with BIOS battery.
AFAIK Windows does not update time automatically unless you installed
any speical software. correct me if I am mistaken.

> What could be reason for this ?

It might be problem with power mangement. Check if your kernel is apm
enabled. If not do it.

Getting OT...

In Windows XP, in Date and Time Properties, there is a tab called
"Internet Time". I am almost sure that my laptop at least, came with
"Automatically Synchronize with an Internet time server" enabled and
time.windows.com as the only server in the server list.

Rs. 500 is approximately GBP 6.

>From what I have seen in the UK, a 2Mbps ADSL link costs about GBP
25-30 per month. The business versions costs even more (you get IP
blocks - a /28 or a /27 depending on provider - etc.)

Intresting comparision. Compare the same with any technical component
this holds good.
Good comparision would be cost of cars in US and India. Price of
Laptops and list goes on.. reason for this is Patents. You have to pay
royality. Thats why Open source community is opposing software
patents.

Prices for Broadband and Internet access are plain cheating.
Particularly the charge for download part when we consider more than
90% of our available bandwidth is not used.

Whats wrong in praising BSNL present offering 256kbps for 500rs is the
best you can find in chennai. Its unlimited download till june ! then
I believe they will have resonable download cap(hoping for this). Only
offer even that comes close to this is 128kbps for 900rs unlimited
download given by airtel (any time any day I prefer uncapped download
over speed).  Could you find any other offering as good as BSNL's ??

sorry for the wrong information. my knowledge of WIndows XP is very

ensure that you have the corresponding usb-* modules (in most cases,
the generic ones should do), hotplug should take care of the remaining
- if you have something like updfstab / fstab-sync, a new fstab entry
should appear seconds after you plug the device in...

            I have found your message in ilugc about installing debian on
915 motherboard.

            I have solved the problem of the SATA disks by choosing the
"compound" driver mode on the bios setup, but it does not recognize the
sound board. I am not a linux expert, have you been able to make it work
(with sound) on the intel 915 ?

The sound works fine. There are just two steps.

1.Find the version of the kernel you are running (using uname
  -r). Then get the kernel headers corresponding to your kernel using
apt-get install
kernel-headers-x.xx.. (e.g. kernel-headers-2.6.8-386-2).

2.Get the ALSA drivers from http://www.alsa-project.org (1.0.8 or
  later). Extract the archive and do the customary ./configure;make;
  make install. Of course, make sure you specify the correct directory
  to configure to look for the kernel headers, e.g. ./configure
  --kernel-src-dir=... or the like. Also do the same for
  alsa-utils. Finally, run /usr/sbin/alsaconf to get you sound card
  on.

As for the graphics, I have not had any success, as XFree86 in Debian
doesn't have support for i915. However, the proper kernel and the DRI
drivers from http://dri.sf.net should do the trick. But I haven't done
it yet, as the package given there is for kernel source. But I'll try
it soon. Any pointers from others using similar hardware would be
helpful.

Thank you.

How much is some? Why do you make assumptions? 

When we do device drivers (which is a huge topic)
sessions as part of GNU/Linux Vidyashram, we shall
discuss both Linux and GNU Hurd.

well when i list, it gives me

[root@localhost root]# ls /usr/src
redhat
but from the site,

http://www.linuxdocs.org/HOWTOs/Kernel-HOWTO-4.html.its given as

"Log in as or su to `root', and cd to /usr/src. If you installed kernel source when you first installed linux (as most do), there will already be a directory called `linux' there, which contains the entire old source tree. If you have the disk space and you want to play it safe, preserve that directory".
so thats y yesterday i had a doubt regd the location of linux DIR.

for the kernel query i get this

... which means the kernel sources were not installed
during installation. You can simple install the kernel
sources alone from the installation CD.

Wait., neither the Open Source Community nor the Free Software
community are opposing patents for the reason "paying
royalty".. though that is an annoyance. The reason they oppose
patents is because in the case of Software, patents are completely
irrelevant. Stating that "not paying royalty" as the motive
undermines the "irrelevance of Software patents" factor.
