(The above does at the country level)

Also, is there anything similar for mapping countries, other than that of

I am struck at solving this 3 jugs problem , the problem statement is:
there are three jugs of capacities 19oz, 13oz., and 7 oz.
The 1st jar is empty and the other two are full. Now we need to obtain 10 oz
into any one of the jar.
How to solve this kind of problems. I just need the logic to start with.

no self-respecting author will not make his book online ;-) When you
meet your pal point him to http://creativecommons.org/ and explain it's
importance to him. Meanwhile I am afraid I will have to live without
self respect - I think I can, because I have python ;-)

For 3 jugs, use trilinear coordinates.
For N jugs, do a breadth first search.

For mapping countries , you can use CDAT which has
created meteorological  field.
Its a python library. More over its desktop application.

Here you can see the India map which is generated  by CDAT.

Maperitive may be what you are looking for. You can also custom-style maps
as per your needs.

I've read a lot of mails about the labs being set up at various
colleges and, I've wanted to know about what happens next ? Does there
exist a system by which the colleges keep track of how the labs are
being used or, report issues with the setup ?

hi gentleman,
i'm extremely sorry that my english is too bad that everyone
misunderstand my idea. I dont mean that the mentors have to spoonfeed
the students through blogs. I never mean that i should get honey
sitting in my place itself. Even i hate tasting honey without some of
my effort in getting it. Let me explain what i really mean.
Suppose, you are a mentor with skills in javascript and xml. And you
have created an orkut application.
Now your blog will contain the following info. .
* project title, description
* tools and technology used (here js,xml)
* detailed description (about 10-15lines)
* pre requistics to get through the project (here, knowledge of js,
xml, a google account, webspace to hold application)
* links for source code, documentation etc. .
And thats it. Now we can examine the pre requistics, get knowledge
through internet, practice some sample codes and then get into the
project.
If i want to develop an orkut application, i dont have to disturb you.
I can go through your blog, get an idea, practice it and get back to
you if i get any doubts.
Instead of one person personaly contacting a mentor, and some other
day someone again contacting same mentor, for same reason then it
kills some time of the mentor. If the discussion is open, anyone can
know it, participate in it. . (that is real open source, right?).
Infact, the mailing list is a good option for that, but searching the
previous mails, or repeating same questions will add little
difficulty.
You can notice some mails with the blog address of the mentor. So if
need that project later, i have to search my mailbox again or post a
mail again regarding the project. So, i suggest to add the blog
address along with the mentor name, mail id, and technology which is
already there.
And dear gentlemen and good ladies, I personaly apologize to each one
of you, if I mean anything wrong. Im really sorry.

I don't think why this is not possible. Oracle seems to be doing this
with almost every open source initiative of sun microsystems.

Nokia is taking over the development of Symbian (again) and the rest
is speculation.

Dear Friends,

        In our Office we are having 8 Desktop Client Machines and 10 Laptops
with Fedora 14, Ubuntu 10.04, Mandriva 2010.1 etc., We are getting Internet
Connection from two ISPs. BSNL (ADSL Dynamic IP) and Sify (Private IP and
not public). Both are 1 MBps. BSNL is Configured to a wireless Router and
Sify is configured in a wired switch. BSNL connection is often going down.
So the laptop users cannot get internet through wireless. So, we need an
alternate solution by configuring a desktop machine, to get both the ISP
lines from two LAN cards. and an output from the third LAN card should give
the trouble free Internet through Wireless. If any one line is down then the
other one should take up automatically, even if any link is very slow then
the other one should take up automatically. Please guide me how to configure
these setup. and if there is any software please mention it. It should be
truly open source.

Hi,

I've read a lot of mails about the labs being set up at various
> colleges and, I've wanted to know about what happens next ?


The engg. colleges in the coimbatore and surrounding regions (Erode, Salem,
Namakkal, Karur, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri districts) have started using open
source software in most of the computer labs for doing their practicals and
also decided to teach linux/foss from the first year onwards. (a engg.
college has requested to setup a lab with Linux/QCAD for mechanical engg.
dept.)


> Does there

As the engg. colleges have the subject 'open source software' in the sixth
semester (
http://www.annauniv.ac.in/syllab_curriculam_pdf/2008/cse_5_8sem.pdf) which
covers LAMPPP, they are in need of foss labs and we have setup the lab with
every proprietary equivalent foss tools and the colleges are experimenting
with all the tools and also have decided to use foss tools in other labs
also.

We have got excellent feedback from almost all the engg. colleges, where we
have setup foss labs and also we all can ensure that, in the coming years
GNU/Linux will be the primary operating system of choice in engg. colleges
here.

We had detailed discussions with many of the engg. college management
authorities, and they have decided to use foss to make better use of IT
infrastructure wherever possible/applicable.

Remember that you can only load balance outgoing IP traffic.

Even traffic shaping can only be done on outgoing traffic.

If you want full link aggregation you should keep the same setup on
the ISP side also.

I dunno about Linux.

With OpenBSD you can do this with trunk(4) interfaces.

You can also use equal cost multipath routing.

Or you can use BGP if there are BGP speakers.

The final way is by using pf(4) to do route-to() between the two
outgoing interfaces.

In other words there are 4 ways to achieve this.

With OpenBSD which is truly open source unlike Linux.

If you are using GNOME, would it be possible for you to use
gnome-display-properties to define the resolutions of the
monitors/display devices attached to your laptop ?

I am using gnome and I *do* have the resolutions set as mentioned above.
The problem is that sometimes when I wake up the machine (or switch it
on) the external monitor only displays a lower resolution.

I can say that I can reproduce the issue infrequently with my set up.
So far I haven't found the cause and I end up using the g-d-p to
reconfigure.

Did you try Alt -  Ctrl - + to change resolution?

You know what to do?

Press Alt , then Ctrl then + .

It cycles between the mode lines in /etc/X11/xorg.conf

I dunno, just guessing.

It might work.

Oh ya, OpenBSD is truly, honestly, evidently, obviously a better, greater
open source software than Linux, but please stop trolling! Nobody is
discussing about the merits of BSD or Linux or Open Source here. Is it any
requirement that this list should have n flames per month or so? Anyway IMHO
we already had enough flame-war for this year; So you can postpone flame

Because this thread is about something else as the subject says. If
there are other things to be discussed, you can start a separate
thread and talk your heart out there and back your opinions with facts
and reasons.

As Girish and Rajgopal suggested, FreeBSD is the ideal solution for you.  I
suggest you use pfsense http://www.pfsense.org/  which will give you a easy
to use web interface to configure all this.  Ideally, use a dedicated box
with CF card running pfsense.  You could get a Soekris Embedded box (
http://www.soekris.com/index.htm) and install pfsense/freebsd on it.  Very
solid solution. We have been using this type of solution for years without
almost no issues.

Have this line in /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Modes 1280x1024 1024x768 800x600

You need to have this line for every monitor you have. Which is to say that
you need to add it to the section.

Then only this will work.

Before you start playing around with load balancing links, may I suggest that
you first upgrade your DSL bandwidth?

4Mbps unlimited DSL schemes are Rs 1500 to Rs 2000 per month.  These
are typically residential DSL schemes, but the ISPs are not too strict and I
know several folks who are using it at work.

External devices may not get fully restored to previous state when you
resume from hibernation.  Simply unplugging your monitor, waiting a few
seconds and replugging it should resolve the issue.

If this problem persists, always disconnect your external monitor before
hibernating your laptop.  Reconnect the display only after your laptop
has fully completed resuming and X11/gnome is fully responsive.

hi to all

recently i heard that jquery using jqtouch to write mobile applications !
but i still not experimented  with that

my doubt is how to write applications for sony ericson,apple ipod, and nokia
mobiles

how to write applications for them which language can i choose ?

and how to integrate the mobile with system (via) usb plug or else any chip
i need to buy ? is the mobile devices can support or they have patents of
their own standards

how we integrate mobile applications and with our own customised
applications into high tech gadgets

do i need to learn client side technologies or server side technologies to
master them !

or

else can i go through the symbian os ?

please clarify

thank u

Hi,

     This mail is to inform all members of ILUGC about Bhavan's (my school) Young Indian's Educational Fair.

        One of the leading complaints of people whom I have switched to    FOSS is that there is virtually no "local PC guy" who knows FOSS    software. So, if they call them up for some help, they just    reinstall *Windows*. So, I realized the need for "Local PC guys" who    know FOSS. I saw the opportunity for that in the EduFair.

        EduFair is a Educational Fair (you guessed it right) for school    drop-outs from slums of near-by areas for our school. It gives them    a chance to work and make a living. NGOs would be offering them    various options in the field of vocational training. Around 500+    school drop-outs would be attending the EduFair.

        I thought ILUGC would be a great "NGO" in teaching them various    simple FOSS skills like installing and configuring Ubuntu, etc.,    Zoho (the SAAS Office Provider) is also coming. I hope the kind    hearted persons in ILUGC would be able to teach them the basic    skills that "The Local PC Guy" requires. The main problem as far as    I can see now, is getting "The Local PC Guys" to accept that there    are better software that is free. We don't have to make the school    drop-outs unlearn the conventional *Windows* tricks. It would be    good deed to us all, because we can start consuming the resources    offered by the new FOSS-trained "Local PC Guys". By the way, it's    not going to be free, and we can expect Yi Net to give some money    for the training purposes. The event is to be held on the coming    Sunday. Bhavan's is willing to let us have a stall, so that the    interested guys can come and have a look.

P.S: Most of school drop-outs are not totally unaware of computers. They do know most basic stuff. The event is being organized this Sunday (5th December)
    
 With Regards,

 --Kumaran R

Nice idea and I am sure ilugc team would help . Anyways making them
the 'local pc guys' is better than making someone who knows everything
to mess with windows :)

My suggestions would be to go slow while teaching them and show them
simple tasks like installing,patitioning ,painting,picture editing ,
office applications etc which would first make them comfortable with
the desktop . Obviously the software manager works by default in
ubuntu hence a bit of practise I guess is all they need to know .
 But as with any GNU/Linux machine some times they get stuck in issues
like network configuration ,mobile broadband , printer , sound
,graphic and other driver issues. This is where we teach them free
software communication and make them approach ilugc or even better
teach them googling or asking in ubuntu forums , IRC etc ( I know its
overkill but it helps ) .

Pavithran

I dunno about others; for Apple you need to learn Objective-C and you
need a simulator
 and if possible buy some apple gear to test it.

ObjectiveC is apparently a good language.

I have a different problem in Fedora with 2 monitors. I have a 1920 X 1080
large monitor connected to my laptop's secondary port. When the laptop goes
to sleep and wakes, the primary and secondary monitors swap, and the task
bar which was at the bottom of the large monitor simply disappears in the
smaller laptop monitor when it swaps. This is because GNOME still thinks
that the task bar is in the large monitor. Stopped using a second monitor
with Linux because of this. Any solutions?

Subject: [Ilugc] Fetching email from catch-all account
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=8rbg2+DyGOZqW7Fxo=JMCBxpY+W3-nLUTdzgs@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I configured postfix with virtual users successfully following the guide at -
http://howtoforge.com/virtual-users-domains-postfix-courier-mysql-squirrelmail-fedora-13-x86_64

Now I want to fetch mails from a catch-all account of my isp and
distribute the emails to local users. I am stuck with the distribution
part. Following is my fetchmailrc config -

**************
poll isp.realdomain
        proto pop3
        no dns
        localdomains domain.local
        envelope "Delivered-To"
        auth password
        user "mailbox@isp.realdomain"
        pass "MyPassword"
        is * here
        fetchall
        no keep
***************

The issue is that fetchmail is trying to deliver the emails to
user@localhost rather than user@domain.local as expected.

Any suggestions what is missing or what needs to be corrected?

Thanks in advance.

or, you could also dock the gnome-display-properties in the taskbar (check the 
Panel Icon option in g-d-p and switch on/off the monitor from there when 
reconnecting).

Hi,


A quick note on Cyclone and Bhavan's Yi:

        Bhavans YI is a part of the Young Indians net, an integral part of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and comprises of a group of young Indian achievers and professionals from various walks of like. It lives with the belief that young Indians can contribute to the community and society at large. It was started to involve the youth in social and developmental projects. It focuses on issues of national importance and motivates a generational change in the economic and social agenda of India.

        Bhavan's Rajaji Vidyashram(my school) has housed Yi for five years. Some of the projects done by us are:

A book mark sale in Odyssey, the proceeds of which were donated to charity
Traffic management in and around school, encouraging car pooling for our school students
The green cover, where we planted saplings in our school premises. On International Climate Action Day, 350 saplings were planted as 350 is the safest ppm of carbon dioxide limit in the atmosphere.
A special Diwali sale
We donated clothes and toys collected from our students to a school for the mentally and physically challenged, Gnana Deepam
Slum empowerment project wherein we aim on empowering the slum dwellers of our locality by teaching them employable skills.
We conducted a medical camp for them and managed to help 200+ with the aid of VS Hospital
We shall also be creating awareness on certain issues which will be done in the form of street plays, seminars, etc,.
        As part of our projects this year, we are organising an a Educational Fair, to give the school drop-outs from the nearby slums to give them a chance to earn a living.

Hi  ilugc@ae.iitm.ac.in ,
 
I just light a candle for 26/11.
It is time to show that we have neither forgiven nor forgotten 26/11.
It is time to remember those who paid with their lives for the fanaticism of
a few, to salute those who gave up their lives trying to shield others, and
to honor those who survived the ordeal of terror.
It is time to light a candle, to show that as we move on, we cherish their
memories, we value their sacrifice and we hail their courage.
 
Please Light a Candle Now at: http://www.indiajaiho.com/LightACandle.htm

No such tool available for English -> Tamil translation. You should
translate the text and use a content management system for serving English /

Message-ID: <AANLkTindt1o+eQX9s+iLF+LU9VRy3v8QJsCXLAr2ngFF@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need to pass answers to a program using bash script. How is it possible. I
have surfed the net and was able to find the below solutions. However the
problem I am facing is, after the program accepts the first answer, it
doesn't accept the second for some unknown reason.

*./command < answers.file*

or

*ans1| ./command* ------ works for only 1 answer as the space needs to be
avoided.

If I type ans1 ans2, It takes both as answer to the first question.

Regards,
Ashish

This is the intended behaviour of Postfix and not fetchmail. Local domains
as a declaration only tells fetchmail or postfix which mail domains it
should consider as local for local delivery as opposed to outside delivery
using SMTP.

In Postfix/sendmail, you will need a unique local user for every email id in
every domain if you want them as separate boxes. A pattern I used to follow
was name_domain for the user name. You will need to map the mail addresses
to the real users using the virtusertable file. Then you will see mails
getting delivered properly to the real users. In the absence of the
virtusertable, postfix simply strips the domain to figure out the username
and delivers it to that user.

Having just email ids also will not allow users to login unless they have
real users. I had for long searched for a module that allows folks to login
using their email addresses as opposed to their real user names (useful for
a mail only system) and found a couple of web frontends that did it by
reading the mapping in virtusertable.

Maybe some one in this list can write a PAM module for this purpose.

just download the deb package and install it,it needs big swap space
as its requirement. when installing package it shows u error if swap
space is not enough then increase swap space and install it,after
installing u have to configure oracle the command will be shown when u
finish installation(use terminal to install or if u use gdebi then
click terminal + button there to view terminal commands). a user named
oracle will also be created. oracle will be there in your applications
menu after installation.

childsplay is a tool somewhat similar to gcompris. But has very nice
audio options like identifying sounds animals make etc.

kanagrama is also good. There are few other anagrama applications, I forgot there name. I will post when recollect.

Friends.

Yesterday, I participated Barcamp5 chennai at PayPal.

It is happy to see that most of the topics included the concepts of FOSS.

The following topics on FOSS were discussed.

Hadoop
Making Money with Free Open Source Software
NoSQL Databases
Contributing to MediaWiki
Full Text Search using Apache Solr
Building FireFox Plugins
Introduction to Android


I handled the session "Making Money with Free Open Source Software"
Shared some thoughts on the business models available in FOSS.
Had good discussions and debates with the people.

Happy see the changes in the awareness of FOSS in the IT Crowd.
Most people know and they are waiting for a good starting to explore the
powers of FOSS.

Let us do our best for them to explore more.

Thanks for the barcamp chennai team.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimSWTjcdj=Ub8hTJOs9OAS9EjXZQJGD_Ot07wKp@mail.gmail.com>

Last Friday, Dec 3, We had a workshop on Gnu/Linux at
SRK Engineering College, Poonamalee, Chennai.

We had around 30 participants from vatious colleges and organizations.
College provided the LAB with redhat machines for the practice.

http://people.redhat.com/aeapen/
Arun Eapen, from RedHat gave intro about the FOSS History and its growth.
Then, he moved to explained the concepts of "Visualization".

Using the "virt-manager" in the computers, he demonstrated on how to install
another OS inside a host.
Participants explored the "virt-manager" and the hands on session was
interesting to all of them.

I showed a demo of ubuntu desktop, multimedia, office applications, and
other alternate applications.

Raman trained on the shell commands and linux file system architecture.
Then, he moved on "Perl" Training.
It was so interesting to see the participants learning perl with much
interest.
Myself and Dhilip were helping them to practise.

Due to less time, I missed the handson training on Python.
Just showed a slideshow about Python.
http://www.slideshare.net/arulalan/python-an-intro

Ended with the talk on "Indian Linux Users Group, Chennai" [ http://ilugc.in]

The feedback from the audience is delightful for all.
they want more workshops like this.
Let us plan and do more.

Thanks for Safia, Sathya Sai, Munisamy, Muthu and other college staff for
the
excellent hosting, food, travel, lab arrangements and the efforts.

The interest on FOSS shown by the college management is so great.
Hoping for more sessions in the college.

Thanks for Arun Eapen, Raman and Dhilip for making this event a good start
for the upcoming events.

Some snaps are here.

Please give your two minutes of time to watch this video.

Done?

Video is so great, Right?
Giving a lot of good feel.

I can feel your questions.

What is in this video about Free Open Source Software Development?

In this video,

People has some problem
Most of the people are being idle, unaware of the problem, but suffered a lot
A little boy thinks that he can give some solution
He starts towards the solution
He initiates the activity
Like minded people joins together
People jump to help even from bus and car
Together they accept the pains and even enjoy it
The effort of the community to solve a problem gets its success
The problem is solved
They all are happy
We all feel good
We realize that together, we can solve the problems

The same is the history of the Free Open Source Software Development.

Proprietary Software companies make the people as their slave
No freedom to share,sell,learn,update their softwares.
But have to pay huge money to buy the Proprietary Softwares.

This is the social problem where some companies change the culture of ?Sharing?.

The sad part is most people dont know that they are slaves.

Richard M Stallman? started to think on finding the solution.
He started the GNU project which gives freedom on software to run
anywhere, to share with anyone, to read the code and learn, to modify
the software and redistribute.
Like minded people from around the globe joined together
GNU/Linux born
Millions of Free Open Source Software are released.
The fight for freedom is still in progress?

Please give your hands to give freedom to the software world.
Let us join together and give freedom to our parents, brothers,
sisters, siblings, children, to the world we live.

Use Free Open Source Software
Deny to use any Proprietary Software
Teach students about FOSS
Talk about FOSS with your pals and your communities
If you find any issues in FOSS, try to fix it or ask a developer to fix it
If you find any software is not available in FOSS, you start it,
people will join with you to contribute

We need more hands to get freedom.
Please join any local GNU/Linux users groups and start contributing.

Hi,


     Automatic updates are very important for any computer connected to the internet. But most of the Windows machines disable it due to the "Windows Genuine Advantage" problem. Further, with Linux you will need to install software from the on-line repository which will also consume your download limit. I strongly suggest you to go for an unlimited connection. You can also try other ISP like You telecom, Tikona, etc,. for cheaper unlimited connections. But, if you still want to disable automatic updates, you can do it with the help of Synaptic Package Manager, in Ubuntu.


P.S: MP3, DVD codecs and Flash plugins will also have to be downloaded from the Internet


 With Regards,
 --Kumaran R

   To OP: if this is for your home computer and if you are opting for BSNL
   broadband, pls consider the Home 700 Unlimited plan or Home 99 Unlimited
   plan - for 700rs it is worth the money as 1) speeds are fairly
   consistent,2) minimum datatransfer limit (2gb or 2.5gb for 700 plan) is
   good enough for heavy browsing 3) and you will pay standard amount every
   month

@Rs.750 p.m. I've been having this link for 3 years now and have found it
good. Their EVDO unlimited also comes for Rs.650 per month with the dongle
@2,500/=. Vodafone has unlimited 3G@899 p.m on a dongle costing Rs.1,600.

These are fixed plans and do not have any billing overruns. For usage such
as yours, you may find these better.

Shouldn't that read "Virtualization"?

IIRC, Redhat is not the "3DS", "CS4" type product

No offense intended

Hai,

You have to edit

$ gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattend

comment out update update you don't want to upgrade automatically

Ex:

// Automatically upgrade packages from these (origin, archive) pairs
Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {
    "${distro_id} stable";
    "${distro_id} ${distro_codename}-security";
//    "${distro_id} ${distro_codename}-updates";
//    "${distro_id} ${distro_codename}-proposed-updates";
};

// List of packages to not update
Unattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist {
//    "vim";
//    "libc6";
//    "libc6-dev";
//    "libc6-i686";
};


PS: I agree with Kumaran, If possible change your plan into unlimited.

Thanks to all,but i already applied for limited connection today morning, so
i can change the plan next month only,for this month i have to use without
updates.. can anyone tell about how to find data usage correctly.
My friend said every time after ending session use system monitor and write
data usage in text file,can i do any small application that automatically
writes data usage in text file (In a time basis,every 10min.log should be
written so that even if system gets hanged or anyother problem i can check
data usage very closely).. is it possible tell me any suggestion.

That will not help in any way from my exp of BSNL.they have a link 
on line to check usage/ The linkk varies as per the user ID you get if it is DATAONE
the link can be found on www.dataone.in if the user is @bsnl.in the go
to their portal. Any way they will give yu  welcome kit a mail to your
registered email id giving all details.

just download the deb package and install it,it needs big swap space
as its requirement. when installing package it shows u error if swap
space is not enough then increase swap space and install it,after
installing u have to configure oracle the command will be shown when u
finish installation(use terminal to install or if u use gdebi then
click terminal + button there to view terminal commands). a user named
oracle will also be created. oracle will be there in your applications
menu after installation.

That would amount to Rs.860 p.m with all taxes included, but the quality of
service is good. The EVDO looks too good. I suggest you try that. Connecting
to Internet in Ubuntu using BSNL EVDO requires configuring wvdial
application.

Prima facie it seems, your CentOS did not install completely i.e. it's
grub seems to be broken.  What you are likely experiencing is the
first stage of grub (from your Ubuntu install) trying to find the
Ubuntu boot files and not finding them.

I would suggest that you use a rescue CDROM/USB stick and repair the
grub with "grub-install"  *or* edit the grub line to point to
filenames installed by CentOS (vmlinuz image and the initrd ramdisk
file).  If this seems to be a daunting task then reinstall CentOS and
watch for any errors (if any).

Good luck.

Your answers.file need to contain the strings identically the same as
you would enter them interactively in one line for each answer.

For example if your bash script asks user for first name?  then line
one would "First"
Next if it asks for last name, the line two would be "Last"

The key thing is have you created answers.file to mimic exactly the
same way you would input in an interactive session?

I did that...Each on one line. no space nothing... still it accepted only

I now downloaded the the tcl and tk packages and tried to install them,
however since gcc was missing, got the compiler errors. When I tried to yum
install gcc, I got the below yum checksum errors. I checked the repomd.xml
file on the server and saw it contained the correct sha256 sum of the
primary_db file that was downloaded. However I was still getting this error.
I found the below link for the same. I cant change the version of sha that
the repo was created with. How can I go around this kind of issue. Is there
a way I can make the python script run sha256 instead of whatever it is
currently running on my system.

Hello Murali,

I'm X Mono developer ;-) as per my understanding, there are other FOSS
projects who do .NET framework, but they are not in same phase as Mono ! So,
you have to go only with Mono, if you need to run .NET on GNU/Linux /
FreeBSD / Solaris / Mac.

Thanks
Nagappan

It could be a bug in your bash script.  Try running it "bash -x <your
script>" interactively and look for errors.

How are they relevant to your original problem?  I suggest you get
your bash fundamentals right before jumping around to other langs.

Steps to stop automatic updates
1. Go to System->Administration->Synaptic
2. Open Settings->Repositories
3. Go to updates tab
4. Deselect "check for updates" under Automatic updates.

You could try Gkrellm for bandwidth monitoring. If you're fine with
CLI, see http://www.ubuntugeek.com/bandwidth-monitoring-tools-for-ubuntu-users.html

You want to set up your system to install packages from the DVD that you have?

Message-ID: <AANLkTin+-nzAAAMU5ZJbxU1vbQj03pShz2OHTjM-67L9@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

         Here is my scenario, We have about 7 Machines, which share the 1
MBps Internet from a wireless router. If any downloading is going on in any
of the system via (bit-torrent or http). the http requests of all other
systems goes down to dead. Is there any FOSS tools to monitor the traffic
for the entire network and to control manually or automatically to share the
available bandwith eqaully for all the systems and also to allocate the
predifined bandwith to a particular machine. If there is any provision to
control the traffic based on protocol it will be very useful.

This has also happens on static sites.  I've had someone running
a static website on Windows hosting provider have the same issue.
It could have also happened due to virus infections on local Windows
clients which are used to FTP upload html files to the web host.

            Even if they had been same, using words like "borrowed" or
"stolen" don't make sense here(free software world). After all, he has
been setting up FOSS labs.

Search for 'linux traffic control', 'linux QoS' or 'linux bandwidth shaping'.

The most popular reference is:

http://lartc.org/

However, note that this document is /huge/ and goes into a lot of detail. You 
might be able to find shorter tutorial which offer a step-by-step guide to 
introduce you to the task. For example:

http://www.topwebhosts.org/tools/traffic-control.php

I need some inputs or guidance on improving the performance of existing c/c++ code on Linux .

I?would like to any guidelines to collect information for the application resource usage/netwok and i/o metrices

Hi,


     Good to hear that you got your broadband connection. But unfortunately, the link that BSNL gives works only with Internet Explorer. :-( But I think you can use Wireshark to analyze your network usage. Or else you can try creating a shell script. Be careful with torrents though!

This is not an easy answer.

But with a bit of experience you will get it.

You want to do bandwidth sharing in a LAN when p2p traffic like
bittorrent is active.

There are many angles to the problem.

First thing is this.

When you choke your upload link your download gets affected in a big
way. This is due to
TCP ACKs not getting thro'. TCP window scaling sees that there is no
available bandwidth
 and falls short of available bandwidth in a big way.

This is why bittorrent affects other downloads since it uploads whilst
downloading.

Now the best way to tackle this situation is to have a firewall kind
of device in between
 to insure that fair allocation is done otherwise known as QoS.

QoS works to a reasonable degree since IP networks are by definition
uncontrollable beasts.

I have not had much success controlling it but with an intermediate
device like a firewall
to arbiter traffic/bandwidth allocation we can get a lot more leeway
than otherwise.

There is much more to it but for now I will stop.

You mean perhaps tcpdump, nmap et. al. right? and a custom time
measurement wrapper for your app?

localhost can be your benchmark host.
(with perhaps the most comfortable performance zone for typical
business app dev junkie)

Preferably send the data our wire and measure the wirespeed and base
your metrics on that. Including SAN if any. (storage Area _network_
right?)

man start with some php-app end-to-end performance tuning. Whew!

What is the authentication system used?  Is it local user authentication, or
any type of network authentication enabled in such FOSS labs..

One more point..  this ILUGC has so many industry professionals..  is there
any survey on how many of them work on open source projects, or how many
started an open source project?  The reason i am asking is that when we
ourselves could not leap to the next level, how can we blame the students
and staffs?

The solution is to create a working environment within the college
itself...  an intranet webserver running within the computer lab..  a mail
server .. a POP3 server..   a local wiki, which collates knowledge from
students..  an intranet forum..  all these at one stage connected to wiki..

So if such a working environment is created within college, students should
have to learn to use these..

Secondly, students should be encouraged to try new applications/ new
initatives for the college use..

Colleges have 8 Mbps bandwidth..  and if properly used, students can publish
their own website within their lab servers..

We have to train students to think practically..  The benchmark for any
initiative/application is how far it is well received among the users..

Good question ! This is exactly the type of question to ask when dealing with 
performance. Most people forget that the precursor to performance tuning is 
performance measurement. Trying to tune something just based on gut instinct is 
like shooting in the dark hoping you hit your target. With proper benchmarking 
you can, for example, come to a conclusion that there aren't really any high 
gains to be achieved by optimizing that small bit of code where the application 
spends just 5% of the time but you can possibly improve I/O throughput 20% by 
just by tweaking a vm parameter.

Now, that said, you should understand 'performance' is a very generic broad 
term. Try to answer the question -- What is it that you wish to tune for ? 
Eventually you shall always end up making trade-offs. For instance, you could 
make gains in I/O or network throughput but that will come at at the cost of 
memory footprint or higher CPU requirements.

If you think about it, your application is no different from any other 
application from the system's point of view. So you can't just measure your 
application in an isolated manner. That will just give you wrong metrics. You 
have to consider measuring both the performance of the system as well as your 
application in it's natural work environment to be able to correctly judge what 
you can tune. So, use the tools you mentioned in conjunction with others for 
your application.

Ok, talk aside - here are the tools that might help:

a. Start simple -- use time, strace (-C option) and ltrace (-c option) to get an 
idea where your time is being spent.
b. Use top/pmap in batch-mode over the life time of your application to see 
where and how memory is being used.
c. Use something like oprofile to get any idea of the environment that your 
application functions in.
d. Use system-tap to instrument the measurement of whatever parameters you are 
interested in measuring.
e. Use tcpdump/wireshark along with netstat to get an idea of actual bottlenecks 
in network traffic.

Once you've collected your data, identify the 'hot-spots' and check to see 
whether you can optimize anything there. There are tons of resources online to 
help you depending entirely on what you wish to optimize for.

Finally here's a site that you might want to take some time to go through:

If this code is on your server, the best way is to audit the entire
code or even better, wipe it off and restore from a backup or version
control. You will never know what other changes were done on the
server.

Shakthi, who is on the list, had worked with Kushal to come up with a
preliminary set of tasks which would do two things : [1] gauge the
level of understanding of the student and, [2] allow a potential
mentor to begin a conversation with the student.

Setting preliminary tasks also help a bit in breaking the ice and
forming good habits. Along with the ability to think smartly the
capability to be able to think in steps, sequentially with tests for
each step is a big thing to coach.

There are assumptions in the above statement, and lot of things can

Subject: [Ilugc] Java library issues
Message-ID: <AANLkTimSRA2iEWp7XV66B8bpWsaLZLK6o5TVWm0FfEJ+@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
  Friends, i'm started an application which uses Jpcap library. I have
done the following steps to use Jpcap library as my senior told. I
downloaded all the necessary packages and performed the following
steps.

     cp /root/project/softwares_req/jdk-linux-6u11-i586.bin /opt

/* Installing java manually */
     cd /opt
     sh jdk-linux-6u11-i586.bin

/* Setting the needed files for jpcap in appropriate directories */

     cp /root/project/softwares_req/libjpcap.so  /opt/jdk1.6.0_11/jre/lib/i386/.
     cp /root/project/softwares_req/jpcap.jar  /opt/jdk1.6.0_11/jre/lib/i386/.
     cp /root/project/softwares_req/jpcap.jar  /opt/jdk1.6.0_11/jre/lib/ext/.

     export JAVA_HOME="/opt/jdk1.6.0_11/bin/java"
     export PATH="/opt/jdk1.6.0_11/bin:$PATH"

Now when i want to run my java program which uses Jpcap, i have to
export the paths as i mentioned, if i execute it in a new terminal. So
where i have to put these jar and .so files so that they can be
referred automatically with out exporting paths?

Dear luggies

On behalf of ILUGC I did a two day tutorial in Kathir Engg College, Coimbatore on 6th and 7th Dec 2010. I covered Intro to FOSS, perl and mysql based on the Anna University Coimbatore Syllabus. Except for 1/2 hr intro session everything else was hands on. It was attended by about 60 students of III year CSE. Many faculty members also took active part. Mr.Baskar of Linxpert did an installation and package management demo using fedore 14.

On behalf ILUGC I thank the management,staff and student for the opportunity.

Subject: [Ilugc] Help needed to install KDE in Fedora 14
Message-ID: <143617.59244.qm@web137409.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hi,
I need help in installing KDE in Fedora 14.

As I had problems with GUI in Fedora 12 & 13, I tried Fedora 14 with default installation. It works all right in Gnome.

I tried installing a few KDE programs using Add/Remove programs, although there were problems initially to make DVD drive accessible. Later I used install DVD (from LFY current issue) itself? to install some more programs.

However, I am unable to get KDE desktop. The Add/remove program keep on asking for QT(86-32) file which I am unable to locate.

Thinking that there could be some problem with the DVD, I tried full installation in a spare HDD and found that both Gnome and KDE were functional.

Thanks in advance for help from fellow members.

Make sure you are connected to the internet

1. Open Terminal
2. Type: su -c ' yum install @KDE Software Compilation'
3. It will ask for the password. Type in the root password.

In the QA Session, Raghavan from SRM expressed his wish on doing a
project in linux kernel
and requested for mentorship.

Sudharsan and others explained the process of getting into kernel
programming and contributing.

The ideas are here.

Decide the finite task to do
look in the bugtracker of kernel.org
look for the feature requests
find the mentors in irc
read the presentation of Shakthi Kannan
http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/i-want-2-do-project-tell-me-wat-2-do.pdf
Fix the driver for Fingerprint reader in laptops
Be patient and keep on learning
Start working rather then searching for mentors
Use Internet to learn the things yourself




The sessions were interactive and interesting.

We had 40 participants from Jaya Engg College, SRM University, Bharath
Engg College, Sree Sastha Engg College, Velammal, MNMJ Engg College,
MIT and Industries like Indian Railways, CollabNet, SlashProg, SS4U,
CDAC, Serendio, Real Image, Corent Tech, Wipro, CSS Corp, TNQ, Aspire
Solutions.

Thanks for making the last meet of the year as more interesting.

Okay.

Then just don't use mplayer GUI.

It will not draw any borders.

And use a good window manager like me(Windowmaker).

I experienced the same issue few months ago. Are you able to detect
the connection?

if you are able to detect the connection, edit the connection and
manually set the ip to 192.168.1.0/24 series and try to ping
192.162.1.1 (its the default) . If you are able to ping, then you
might get access to internet using wireless or you need to configure
your wireless router accordingly ( I think every wireless point has a
simple web UI, which can be used). There are various tutorials on
configuring your BSNL connection for wireless access.

For automatic assignment of Network settings, you must enable DHCP
server using the access point's web UI.

HI,

> I cant able to detect the connection

I think you must configure your access point as given in
http://www.mp.bsnl.co.in/bb/ut300r2u/wireless/300r2uwl.htm using a wired
connection before making use of the wireless.

I think you have users set in , so you can add the export to your
bashrc. That is you can add the above lines of export to

vi ~/.bashrc

or you can add it to end of /etc/profile

Subject: [Ilugc] zimbra and exchange
Message-ID: <1292224526.2264.7.camel@localhost>

hi,

a large company in Coimbatore recently migrated from microsoft
outlook/exchange to zimbra. And within a month they migrated back. The
top management is very much pro open source (their CMD attends LUG
meetings). The reason for going back is 

1. zimbra is too slow
2. search feature is missing - or does not cut it.

the explanation given by a director (who is pro open source) is that
linux mail systems are file based and hence slow, whereas Exchange is
database based so is faster. They would be quite happy to migrate to
FOSS if these problems are solved.

That's elementary dear Dr. Kenneth, :)

For example:
/etc/fstab
[change this]
LABEL=/                 /                       ext3    defaults        1 1
[to]
LABEL=/                 /                       ext3
defaults,noatime        1 1

Zimbra uses Apache Lucene library for indexing and search. However, the
community edition comes with very limited search options. They have more
sophisticated search options such as full text search, attachment search
etc  in their Network Edition which you have to pay for.  Thats one of the
features with which they differentiate their paid products from community
version.

One of the options is to setup a Apache Solr based full text indexing and
search server for Zimbra and feed your emails with Sor Data Import handler.

Thanks

I am assuming that they have been using the Open Source edition of the
product <http://www.zimbra.com/products/zimbra-collaboration-suite.html>

When they state that Zimbra is too slow, what do they mean - does the
application take time to parse mailstores ? They may need help in
sizing the hardware

It is a good idea to use a traditional mail client or, even the Zimbra
desktop edition with the Zimbra backend server

Dear KG,

This is the conundrum we face every minute. There never are easy
answers. Conidering exchange possibly uses some proprietary protocols.
I am not Microsoft expert to comment on that further.

One thing I seem to notice is that everyone wants a "drop-in" replacement.

There are no open source drop-in replacements.

I once had a tough time because of bad instalDisk-1.

Enterprise nowadays demand / expect a guarantee on their critical
services availability.

Each software componant  necessarily requires a service component
associated with it just like hardware componant or consultancy
componant, overhead component, logistic componant etc. which industry
should find and nurture.

/ramble
Just my 2 paise worth.

Regards,

Rajagopal

Open with any tool that can handle XL and do save-as-csv. I know MS
Office does that. I am sure openoffice would.

You haven't mentioned the data fields in your .xls. You can write a
script with Perl (for example).

To read .csv you can use Perl Text::CSV [1] and to write to database,
use Perl DBI [2].

SK

[1] Perl Text::CSV.

In basic terms, an installation of Zimbra will provide you with a
mailstore against which accounts can be configured and, a
calendaring/collaboration system.

Zimbra also provides a desktop client
<http://www.zimbra.com/products/desktop.html> that you can use with
the Zimbra installation (or, any other mail/collaboration server)

Using standard mail clients (mutt, alpine, Thunderbird, Evolution,
Sylpheed, Kmail etc) to access IMAP/POP accounts serviced by the
installation of a Zimbra server can work out faster in terms of
searching mails.

the MD of the company has 10 GB of stored mails - what about the point
that database storage is faster searched than filesystem storage?

I have 28 GB of mails on which I receive faster results when I search
them locally using a mail client.

A mail client like Thunderbird for example will index the offline
emails. If you are looking at performance improvements (for which
there has to be performance data from previous and current system to
enable benchmarks) you are basically looking at hardware sizing,
filesystem tuning and handling of locks on the files.

you can try mysqlimport for loading data. First convert to csv using Openoffice. If too many files are to be converted try OO with headless options or better using perl.

Hi all,
         The pycrypto modules produces the encrypted output in the form
'\x0a\x9f'.We need to store the ciphers in db.
We are not able to store it  in the database as it is.So is there a way to
store it in db such as postgresql without any conversions
or a way to convert the string in storable forms using python?

even if you enable unicode in the postgres db you cannot store?

 This package appears to be no longer under maintenance.An alternative to
most of the pyExcelerator functionality is offered by xlwt (
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt), which is a fork of pyExcelerator with
immediate and continuing bug fixes and enhancements, and is supported on
Python 2.3 to 2.6.

I using MySQL  :  LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE to load tab separated text file.

Like this :
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE Yourfilename.txt INTO TABLE Tablename FIELDS
TERMINATED BY '\t'" LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' (filel1,filed2...);

If you have open office, open the xls file using openoffice-calc and save it

Ensure your data cells have correct formatting applied
before you convert to csv using OpenOffice.

Eg when I exported xls sheets to csv, phone numbers
got messed up - lost leading zeroes, and lost the +
char in +91..., etc.

Hi

Just sharing a small incident of influence of M$ on hardware.
I have been suffering with overheating of my Dell laptop for about over a
month. It occurs(yeah still occurs) only with linux and not with windose.
Earlier I thought it was a kernel issue but now I have figured out that
the problem looks like that the acpi bios seems to be compiled with m$
compiler, though iasl for linux only reports certain optimizations only but
a deep insight into dsdt.dsl indicates this or at least have m$ influence
over it heavily.

It seems that manufacturers are forced to comply by m$ otherwise they'll
have to pay the "microsoft tax" in terms of getting blacklisted for
distributing windose or create some other problems for them (I am not much
aware of businees ethics :D )

Some findings and discussions have lead to this conclusion that some
manufacturers have been duped into allowing there acpi code to be compiled
by m$ compiler

When you have learned to snatch the error code from the trap frame, it will

Welcome to reality!!!.

Well just in case, one may want to check out linux supporting laptops.

Lenovo comes to mind... and many more..

Works fine with ubuntu 10.04 (I suppose) but mo idea about robust ones
like RHEL/CentOS etc.

You got it a bit backwards. From the ACPI wikipedia entry:
-------------------------------------------------
In computing, the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) 
specification provides an open standard for unified operating system-centric 
device configuration and power management. [...snip...] The standard was 
originally developed by Intel, Microsoft, and Toshiba ...
-------------------------------------------------

and then right there in the first section itself ...

-------------------------------------------------
Some software developers have trouble implementing ACPI and express concerns 
about the requirements that bytecode from an external source must be run by the 
system with full privileges.[5] Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel, 
once described it as "a complete design disaster in every way", in relation to 
his view that "modern PCs are horrible".[6]
-------------------------------------------------

So, it is not like acpi has to be /compiled/ with a M$ compiler (I am not even 
sure what that is supposed to mean). It is more like ACPI has to be 
/implemented/ using a 600 page specification designed by M$, which almost 
necessitates the acpi subsystem to include an entire freaking 'parser' as a 
driver[2] if one wants to use it as intended.

Of course, as is M$'s nature, their idea of a specification is stuff that others 
ought to implement although they are free to make exceptions and since h/w 
manufactures are happy just confirming to the M$ subset of the specifications, 
implementations that do actually confirm to the specification still might not 
work as expected. ...sigh.

cheers,

expect is written in TCL. I got errors when I tried to download and
configure expect, (to use it in the bash script). I tried the -x option, it
didn't throw any errors, nor does it show the parameters being passed to the

I got the same problem couple of days ago and BSNL's weird configuration was
preventing me from connecting to wireless.

Connect via wired connection and access the router [192.168.1.1] -> Wireless
[under configuration]

You'll see four options in the wireless configuration page - Basic |
Advanced | Mac Address Filtering | <I don't remember the fourth>

Click on Mac Address Filtering, you'll see an option called 'Mac Auth'
something. Make sure that is set to 'Disabled' & you should be good to go.

[if set to Whitelist, then only the specified ip's can access; if set to
Blacklist, then any ip's other than the specified ones can access]

Hope this solves your problem.

Oh, btw I assume you have Teracom type modem.

if you want a good person, do not insist on RHCE certification. Look at
his/her skills first. I am quite sure that most of the people with good

Using database properties:

Use the -dp option to specify the location of the database

If you are looking for the equivalent (more or less) of Toad for
Oracle / SQL Develoer for Oracle, then SquerrilSQL comes to mind
(http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/).

You will have to download the Java Driver JAR file (JDBC Driver) from
http://jdbc.postgresql.org/ and add it to the list of drivers before
configuring your database. Ofcourse, you need java to be installed on
your PC.

Download the JDBC JAR (Java Database driver JAR file from
http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html. Add it to the class path
like this:

$export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:<path to the jar file, including the .jar>

Thank you for your solution friend. My another need is i manually
installed java. Now i want to use Jpcap library with java installed

I remember using pgaccess as recently as Fedora 12 but couldn't find it in the 
Fedora 14 repository. A quick search threw up pgadmin3 which looks a lot like 
pgaccess, so I am assuming the name changed:

          I remember using phppgadmin(this is wed based, not a
stand-alone GUI app) for accessing psql db. It used to be quite good.

You have not mentioned which distro you are using. So if you are using
redhat based distro then the following will show from where it has got
the package

rpm -qi <package name>

where you will see packager info from which you can conclude where you
got the file from.
Two things that i noticed
First you say apt-get, so it must be some kind of debian based distro.
But i am not familiar with dpkg, so please search engine to find out
equivalent of rpm -qi in dpkg
Second you have mentioned you installed from the bin file. Not deb.bin
or rpm.bin file. So whatever dpkg reports will be your distro 's java
and other one is from sun.
To find out the files you have got from distro packager i will do the
folllowing in redhat based distro. Please find the equivalent in dpkg
rpm -ql <package name>


so does that answer your queries ?

Hi,

What about "getopt" and "getopts"?
Both "getopt" and getopts are tools to use for processing and validating
shell script arguments.

Here is a C example I posted earlier :

it is two different things - I think pgaccess is no longer maintained. I
have pgadminIII, but do not see any graphic view.

Hi,

I was wondering whether anyone in the group has the list of all the Pincodes
in India.
If you have any other information along with it (like, cityname, long ,
lat), then it would be all the better;
but if you have vanilla pincodes alone - even that would do.

If you are upto some work, you can post queries on the Indiapost site
http://www.indiapost.gov.in/Pin/Pinsearch.aspx and extract the table info
programatically. If you give a blank in the PINCODE box, it dumps the db,
paginated though.

There have got to be better places to ask this question. Anyway, just
google 'india pincodes xls', go to the citehr link, use a bugmenot

You might want to look into RVM (Ruby Version Manager). Try
this URL: http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ and follow the
instructions. On Ubuntu and FC14, I had to do this to install
ruby without having to worry about Fedora/Ubuntu package
availability/dependencies.

Once, you've configured RVM, switch to 1.9.2 version and try
'gem install rails --version=3.0.3' to get rails 3 up and running

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

That _is_ pretty neat. Perhaps you could write to India Post? They do
allow you to check which PIN code corresponds to which area on their
website. It's a long shot, though.

Thanks.

The problem is not a lookup with India Post, but getting ALL the data so
that we can
do more fun with that. For eg. now, i am doing a TSP for whole of India with
the
zipcodes; for problems of this magnitude, we *cannot*  lookup.

Indeed, that was why I suggested writing to them. Pointing out that they
could allow you to lookup was only to suggest that they already have the
information in a format that would make it easy to provide it to you.

Did you check the links ? I just did a 'yum install pgadmin3' and it gives me

I was expecting this from you , hence gave a link for foss.in schedule
instead of event main page . Its exciting in my perspective because
big names like Danese cooper, Harald welte are over there and
importantly it has miniconf on fedora and meego .

Coming to nonameconf I like the spirit in which they started ,agreed
that they weren't able to put up a meet in Dec of big scale , they
haven't given up and started an unconf for which I guess they do
deserve some appreciation .

Message-ID: <AANLkTim7yh1EHmDxZtuxEgD7rih+qSD4t0qjdyh5phTb@mail.gmail.com>

I'd be interested in hearing (off the list) from freelance Flash programmers
who can port a perl/SDL game to Flash (GPL'ed).

The game was developed in under 3 days, and given the logic, the concept,
art work, etc., are all already available, I'd like to think its a much
easier job to port to Flash.

You can download the game in it's existing form from http://peakoilgame.com/

The desired programmer, besides being experienced with Flash based game
programming, will be adept at reading the ("mostly" object oriented) perl
source code, will setup the perl game and try it out first for
understanding, clearly write down achievable SMART goals and implement them
in 3 stages of a working swf.

Please revert with
  1. your CV
  2. reference contacts from earlier projects you've worked on (preferably
Flash games)
  3. SMART goals and effort estimate
  4. commercials

got the gui - cannot figure out how to get a graphical view of the table
relationships. (one nice thing about the tool is that it has a tab
called anomalies - glad to note that none of my dbs have anomalies!)

Autocd:

    It's a Auto Directory changing command. We can change into any
directory without the use of 'cd' command.So we can utilize the time
of typing "cd" command. ;)


thasu at tha-admin-da ~ $ shopt -s autocd
thasu at tha-admin-da ~ $ Desktop/
cd Desktop/
thasu at tha-admin-da ~/Desktop $ cd
thasu at tha-admin-da ~ $ /var/log/cups/
cd /var/log/cups/
thasu at tha-admin-da /var/log/cups $

To reside the above option as a permanent one, edit the .bashrc file
and add this line "shopt -s autocd" into it.

Enjoy :)

No. This is a self-funded project by an individual, and, to the best
of my understanding, he is the sole driver of the project as of
now[1]. He is extremely receptive to user feedback (personal
experiences), and the project is very good.

Hi Shrinivasan,
Just registered for the Ubuntu Day but I didn't get email confirmation. 
Is it normal? The webpage says, "Thanks for submitting your 
registration! You have been confirmed to attend the Ubuntu Developer 
Day. " but what do I have to carry with me to identify myself as the 
registered person for the meeting?

Thanks,
Shankar

I am reminded of famous saying 'begining of all things are small' and 'a thousand mile journey starts with  a small step'.

When google made its appearance when others like askjeeves (or some such thing I don't remember now) were ruling, many thought like this.

Welcome!
        Don't panic. Just explore your self. 'Ubuntu manual' is useful
for basic needs. You may may get guidelines from

help.ubuntu.com
wiki.ubuntu.com

and also from it's forums too.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimLPWox5H2uopE8oE53rt1WE5ZquhOVg9DPVBcu@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have problem with ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10 in laptop Hp Pavilion dv2700.

for past three days, I am installing, re-installing, re-installing . . .

On Tuesday I have installed ubunuu 10.10 with dual boot.

After installed it, it was working properly.

the next day, I can not see the login screen. Its always showing the ubuntu
logo only.

In recovery mode, it says "setting fstab".

My fstab has no problem.

Also I was run the fsck /dev/... [all]


On wednesday again I reinstalled with ubuntu 10.04.

/ on /dev/sda7 , /home on /dev/sda6 and swap on /dev/sda5 with 'ext4' type.

It was working perfectly on that day fully. I mounted USB drive, CD-ROM.

But today when I switch on the system, I got the same problem like ,
'setting fstab'.

I cant login in tty1 and all. i.e. I cant login in anyway.

I was run fsck from live cd and checked the fstab many times. it has no
problem/error.




ubuntu at ubuntu:~$ sudo fdisk -l

Now again going to re-install it with 'ext3' type.


I dont know where is the problem.

Either hard disk failure or os cd failure. The thing is, if the os cd has
problem means, how can I do all the works after installed successfully.

Or Laptop itself has problem ... ?

Any suggestions ...

I've always asked people to stay clear of HP and Compaq laptops. They're
crap IMHO. But that's because of my bitter experiences with HP systems.
They're serious when they say they recommend Microsoft Windows.

That said, you can see if some other Linux distro works fine on the laptop.
Something like Fedora might cut it. Although it's unlikely that your media
 is corrupt, it's a good idea to do a md5sum check to verify integrity of
the installation media.

Are you dual booting alongside Windows? WUBI?

Yogesh.

What do you mean by chat engine? If you mean a chat client, empathy or

Subject: [Ilugc] [Tip] The Hardware Lister
Message-ID: <AANLkTikf4ShNZsK9a-dDdJY6ZSorwMcvzmGQKFbga3RL@mail.gmail.com>

lshw:

lshw (Hardware Lister) is a small tool to provide detailed information
on the hardware configuration of the machine. It can report exact
memory configuration, firmware version, mainboard configuration, CPU
version and speed, cache configuration, bus speed, etc.

In Ubuntu 10.10, It's work without extra package.

$ sudo lshw

If you use Yum (Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS, etc), run the following
command in terminal:

$ yum install lshw

$ lshw

Shorter Output:

If you just quickly want to quickly find the chipset version of a
piece of hardware is, you can run the following to provide a very
short output that should give you what you need:

$ sudo lshw -short

I agree with this view completely. In recent past I've had problems with
them sometimes in even recognizing wifi, correct monitor settings etc in
Ubuntu as well as Debian. Dell is better in terms of GNU/Linux as far as my
experiences go.

@OP: In any case, can you check if the problem appears after you go into
windows once or just by repeatedly restarting into Ubuntu itself?

If your requirement is simple and plain remote login and use then 

a. X -query remotehost will give you the login screen of the system. Offcourse you have to enable xdmcp in the remote.
b.Xnest can do the same within X environment.

Or try ssh as suggested by another poster.

Please note thate above do not grab the desktop already running on the remote. They only enable you to use the remote system.

I am thinking of buying a new one. Please suggest. I remember there being a
site for this Linux supported  hardware (laptops, mobile phones, etc.).
Can't recollect tho'. Do I need to start a different thread for this?

What is the best way to set up an LDAP server in terms of availability and

one company. Should we use an existing server to host it from or acquire a
new VPS for it? Alternatively if we are going to be paying for many
commercial VPS's we might want to consider colocating one of my servers.

Why not? This is a LUG and not an FSUG! :) And to promote Linux, it's not
all that bad to suggest proprietary s/w if there's no competent free
software alternatives IMHO. If I'm wrong please correct me. If the reply is
going to be long, we'll have it in a separate thread. :)

There is foss alternate for everything , it may be superior or poor..
LUG is just a name.. LUG is not for promoting Linux kernel.. Its not a
kernel mailing list.. We deal with Open Technology..
Yes, it is very bad idea for suggesting non-foss s/w.
Strongly bad idea. one should be banned for promoting such software.

I would suggest you familiarize yourself with LDAP concepts (O'Reilly
title on openLDAP covers the basics) before jumping into
implementation.  This is critical to help you plan your Directory Tree
structure.

openLDAP, Apache DS,  389 DS (Fedora) are some of the implementation.

(a) How many user entries in your Directory Server?
(b) How many systems (*nix/Mac OS X) will bind with your LDAP server?
(c) How many MS systems (MS Domain) will bind with your LDAP server?

These are some of the questions you need to answer to engineer your
LDAP server(s).

To distribute the connections, I would suggest configure multiple LDAP
servers (running on guest OS in Virtual Machines) with
replication/sync between them.

may be dmesg output and your /var/log/messages can help to detect the

where it stuck?

I bought an Acer 5542 (2009) that came pre-installed with "DOS",
pretty much useless.

Ubuntu 9.10 - no display, openSUSE 11.2 OK (used it for about 8
months), finally Debian Squeeze OK; settled with Debian.

IMO, try different distros and see which works best with your laptop.

Message-ID: <1292524932.3955.1.camel@mjolnir>

Hello,

Does anyone know of a VPS provider who actually hosts Linux servers in
India? I'm interested specifically in companies whose servers are
physically in India.

XDMCP is the best option. Please read on it and see how it fits your
need. Also i dont know if x11 forwarding over ssh will suit you or
not. Do read about x11 forwarding.

All the above are easy to accomplish

Well I don't have a directory server outside of Crowd which is only
currently used for JIRA. I have about 5 or so users for the email systems
and most other systems have 2 users - root/admin and 'zico' as a
non-priviledged account. I may have contractors coming and going for certain
jobs and I would like to be able to add and remove permissions as needed
from one place.

I appreciate the need for redundancy but I'm a bit short of RAM on the
office
machine at the moment,

Okay, if I set up a clean new VM inside the office network and
access to it is that the best way to proceed?

Teamviewer is really fantastic man.

When a customer asks me to use it I can't tell him it is not FOSS. ;)

I find that it is really fantastic and not crappy like other
commercial stuff like VmWare.

I don't feel awkward about it. I did not pay for it and their free
edition works quite well. :)

My views are different. You may be right saying there's a FOSS alternative
for everything. But a newbie who doesn't care about free software principles
will find it unappealing if you suggest a free software which is not mature
/ superior. You and I may be OK with it but he may not be. While it's a good
thing to promote free software, we must also keep in mind that the user just
needs to get his work done. If he's a FLOSS enthusiast, good. But if he is
not and is considering using Linux, then we mustn't discourage him by giving
him something that does not get his work done (in the name of promoting open
tech.). He may be put off. If I were a new Linux user, I'd like to be
suggested superior software (that works on Linux), regardless of whether or
not it's open source. I'd really like it if someone says "Hey, this is what
you need. It's proprietary. But there's also an interesting open source
alternative, you might want to check it out..". and then he can do the
evangelism stuff. This is from my experience with new Linux users.

Your views are perfectly valid, but out place. This list is meant to promote FOSS so refrain from promoting others. It can be done elsewhere, like sending OP offlist mail.

... minus proprietary software, even if it runs on it. Different user
groups exist for different reasons. Knowing why a group exists, and
what values, principles they stand for is important to be part of the
group.

Free/open source software developers work with it for a reason, that
they enjoy the availability of source, and they like to share the
know-how with other people, which is not true with proprietary
software with their EULA (even if it runs on *nix). So, proprietary
software is a definite no-no in any F/OSS group.

The very basic fundamental principle that we like to share source code
and knowledge with other like minded people is why such F/OSS user
groups exist, and there is no room for comparison when this basic
principle is ignored.

Just my thoughts,

SK

It didnt write any messages in /var/log/... . I already look over those
files.

It has only my last shutdown messages.

Other than that, it didnt have even today login messages.

... and what have you done so far to help yourself?   Please
understand that mailing list members are not running "Tutorial
Classes."

I suggest that you use some search engines with the keywords of what
you are interested in; most of them will indeed point you to "step by
step" tutorial sites.   Read the material and follow the instructions,
ask for specific help when you are stuck - this is the FOSS way of
getting and giving help.

True. And where can I find the said things for this group? I joined only
about a year ago.

Yes. But I thought this was *just* a *Linux Users* Group. Didn't know you
were critical on proprietary s/w (even if it might convince newbies to start
using Linux). There were a lot of threads about Oracle, proprietary games,
etc discussed if I remember well. That gave me an impression that the group
is not very critical of proprietary software. Most people (serious users
doing serious businesses) would definitely not adopt Free Software just
because it gives them freedom. They'd go for it if the software is
technically superior in some way. And getting Linux into the hands of
serious users will IMO be very good for Linux and its progress.

Agreed :)

>

My focus here is to try and introduce new people to Linux. If it comes to
convincing them to switch to Linux on grounds that their favourite
proprietary software works on Linux, I'm very much OK with it. I'd tell
someone to switch to Linux by convincing them that Picasa works on Linux!
Later, I would definitely let them know of F-SPOT, Shotwell etc. to get them
to switch to Free software. And then comes the preaching about FOSS part.
But evangelism comes last, getting them to start using Linux or some free
software is the priority and then the rest of the aspects will be
automatically discovered. I've been successful in doing this is what I was
trying to say. I was not promoting proprietary software and have no intent
of doing so in the future. I was merely clarifying the stands of the people
of this list.  Just my two cents..

And I'd love to have some pointers to the objectives, values, etc of this
list ! A link or something will do great.

Please avoid such info - 'cause it is meaningless.  What is  Crowd and JIRA?

More useful info would have been:  this server will be visible on the

Whatever you do, avoid populating individual system's "root" users
data in LDAP.  Besides, 'root' user I also define a local user e.g.
sysadmin that is not present in the LDAP Directory.  In other words
all "admin" users are defined in the systems' local db.

Given your scenario, you could start your VM with as low as 64MB and
achieve your objective.  As for LDAP administration, there are several
clients - LAM (php based, Apache DS client (needs JRE).

BTW, I am assuming you have a DNS server for the domain you plan to
implement in the LDAP server.

I hope the above is enough to get you going.  Good luck.

Thats good idea. I personally haven't used teamviewer. If there is no FOSS
alternative, then we proceed. I would like to work on this if it is based in
python/c++.

At the moment, there doesn't seem to be any good alternatives.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_remote_desktop_software>The
underlying protocols (on which the whole issue of remote desktops are based)
also need some programming love.

Hi, all,

Thank you for your responses, Girish, Manokaran, Kenneth. I'll give
these two a look-see:

1. CtrlS

2. e2enetworks

I think I'll give Odisha Networks a miss. Wouldn't want to encourage
such behaviour, would we? :)

Good to know that many people are interested in developing such a FOSS
alternate to Teamviewer.
How to start this?
What are the technologies, protocols required?

There are rumors that del.icio.us is going down soon. I would suggest that
we look into
1. PyBKM
2. bookmark-manager (http://www.bookmark-manager.com)
3. Magnolia
4. bkm (bkm.sourceforge.net)
5.  Scuttle
6. ...

How the  teamviewer makes the remote session over web?
How it makes the remote control possible?


Let us discuss about building alternate for teamviewer in this thread.

From the wiki comparision ssh+x11 seems to be most complying foss alternative. It lacks filetransfer and audio support. It may be a better candiate. I think we should

a. run ssh over http and show a desktop. Looks like already possible.
b.add feature for file transfer - use scp+nice gui
c.audio support - may be pulseaudio since it has network capability

Offcourse we have to think a lot more.

I think a decision on "supported platforms" should me made.
The choice of the libraries/architecture will depend on this, to make it
easier for porting on different platforms.

We could have a client/server for
Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, J2ME...

I, however, see an issue as dimdim uses Flash within the desktop browser.
Maybe this group can strip Flash and use HTML5 instead and make this version
free of proprietary software.

The comparison mixes two kinds of software - one which is a remote desktop
like LTSP and another which is desktop sharing which is initiated by the
desktop owner like LogMein.

Dimdim is a desktop sharing platform.

These are my thoughts,

Remote desktop software and vpn are not the same. You can do remote
desktop to a machine on public ip open on internet and you have
sufficient credentials and needed ports are open. For this we already
have solutions in place like remote desktop (RDC, remote desktop
connection) for windows from Linux 9atleast it is available in ubuntu
and fedora) and vnc and x11 are available in Linux. But what
teamviewer does that is not available in other tools is that it make
session sharing possible over port 80 (i think so), it is able to
navigate through proxies. This remote desktop sharing is made possible
by creating a invisble vpn session and that session is given to only a
GUI that does remote desktop and file transfer and remote audio
possible. So analysing protocols willl be long way to do it. Instead
we should be able to reverse engineer the product, like the way gnu
makes many of its things work on windows and build a opensource
quivalent.

Most probably another case of network setting. I think you need to be
in bridge mode for the vm to able to access the LTSP server.

There's no such thing as unlimited space or bandwidth.

Read the fair usage policy in the SLA and there's always a limit or catch.

No.  I use dnsmasq inside the office network - everything else just uses the
DNS service provided by the company I brought the domain names from.
Should we set one up then?

What are your thoughts regarding all of this operating behind a consumer
(domestic) ADSL line? Should we be considering colocating a server?

+1
Also, Dreamhost provides several features and goodies including mailing
lists, webmail, direct import of site from old host and 'one-click install'
of several applications.

Thanks Raja !!!

So in your view dreamhost.com is the BEST one. They charge 8.95 $/ month
which i thing is not that cheap. Uni Tech host and eWebGuru charges are much
lower compare to this (Around  Rs.1600/year)

dnsmasq should be good enough as long as you have *all* your internal hosts
defined in /etc/hosts of the system hosting the "dnsmasq" and systems
binding to the LDAP server are on the *intranet*.

Typically, Directory Services is visible only within the enterprise's
network (LAN + VPN) - this has been the case in my experience.  As long as
all machines binding to the LDAP server are on the *intranet* (behind the
firewall) it should not matter.

I do not understand why you are bringing up colocation (presumably in the
cloud)  as an option.  IMO it is not necessary.  It would be helpful if you
can elaborate on your network setup.

I have not used this feature in my setups;  perhaps this link is a good
starting point for your interest (the first hit in my search "openldap cn
config")

<http://www.zytrax.com/books/ldap/ch6/slapd-config.html>

Another good resource for openLDAP is the suretec site; specific to your
query is this link
<
http://blog.suretecsystems.com/archives/159-OpenLDAP-Quick-Tips-Switch-to-the-dynamic-config-backend-cnconfig.html

BTW, the online manuals on BIND and openLDAP by Zytrax are excellent
reading.

For further reference, openLDAP Admin Guide and openLDAP mailing list (which
is quite active).

Host or guest?

How many baremetal boxens here?

how you go dr and the such

 too many open and unanswered questions... before any sensible answer
can be given.

Kindly elucidate your problem more accurately.

And there may be members who are here watching for mutually beneficial
commercial opportunities. That's fair and open source.

There are several promo codes which give you upto 80% off on thy first year.

My primary requirements were for shell access, ability to install custom
apps, and a modern Linux distro - Dream Host satisfied all.

If you don't need shell, then you can get hosting as cheap as $1.95 per
month.

See www.webhostingtalk.com forum for end user experiences with various
hosting providers. It helped me during my research.

Sure.
I have a rented VPS that provides the web server and mail server. This is
provided by slicehost.

My office network is behind a NAT router and I use DYNDNS to get a domain
name to it.
I sometimes work on the move.
My office network exposes port 22 and port 80 to the outside world.
Port 22 is routed through to the domain0 on the server here, a sun X4150
RAID 5, 4GB RAM.
On this server is a virtual machine that provides the development server, on
here apache at port 80 proxies through to 8080 where tomcat is running
various services for my dev environment (hudson, nexus, jira, sonar). Port
80 from the outside world is routed to port 80 on the virtual dev server.
Apache also provides the SugarCRM service.

Subject: [Ilugc] How to use Drupal to setup a knowledgebase ?
Message-ID: <AANLkTim8o7UEsiW_aHWFhObt=5sQqprvhDbyBTcj2e0r@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am working on setting up a knowledge base for an organization.

Here are the required features.


1. The public can find information easily and efficiently.
A. Robust search on the site itself.
B. Searchable from the Web, e.g. Google.
C. More than one answer is available, and the leading answer is listed first.

2. The public can contribute to the information easily and efficiently.
A. Preferably, no membership required. However, we understand that
business requirements may override that.
B. When there is more than one answer, user votes determine the
ranking of the answers.
C. Users can earn credibility in the form of user points or some
similar mechanism.

3. The doc team and support team can contribute to the information
easily and efficiently.
A. Each admin team member can do admin tasks, such as approving,
removing, promoting and demoting posts (overriding the user voting
mechanism).
B. Each doc team member can also function as a standard member of the site.
C. We can import an arbitrary number of FAQ items at once, from XML
source. This is a rare event, but must be expected to happen from time
to time and must be supported.



Explored phpMyFAQ and OSQA. They are not meeting all the expectations.

I wish to to setup this with Drupal.

Is it possible to use drupal for this requirement?
What are the required modules?

Please share your suggestions.

Thanks.

Greetings,

Has anybody tried e-groupware

It has tons of feature...

Including filesharing, resource allocation (rooms, lcd projectors,
laptops) management etc.

Of course it is best to have a DNS (preferebly dynamic) and directory
server installed to reduce the namespaces within an organization

I did come across a php script


the client part is here;
http://www.ddns.nu/


It is also suggested that there be a server code which developers here
can help implement and thus greatly simplyfy the availability of
Dyndns protocol based server within their premises.


Regards,

Rajagopal

Can you elaborate what you mean when you say "more privacy"? How do
you say duckduckgo is ensuring that?

As a separate note, I believe we are here to keep things to move
forward in F/OSS spectrum and not always slamming or running campaign
against others though it required at times. Also refrain using psuedo
product names like M$ etc. It just shows folks are more interested on
less positives :)

Let's wait and watch! btw, we claim duckduckgo tops google per OP;
However this is what I see for specific patterns:

<start>
Did you mean XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX?
Suggested Topics:

No results. Try Google.
google.com search
<end>

Does that mean DuckDuckGo *officially* recommends Google Search if
it's unable to provide results? I guess there is something behind it.

this particular debate is fueled by the need to keep a platform neutral
and product neutral atmosphere in the group. In India we have a habit of
going for the 'most popular'. For example a car mechanic will refer to
the starter as a 'Delco'. It is not a Delco - delco was a popular brand
of starter which had a monopoly at one time. Similarly people do not say
'web browser' - they say IE or firefox. And they do not talk of search
engines - they say 'google'.

I feel the word M$ accurately reflects the aims and methods of that
particular company.

Looks like you want seamless access from Intranet and Internet.   IMO, it
would be best if you setup openVPN to access your resources from the
Internet and also use LDAP auth.

Setting up my org's DS in the cloud is beyond my comfort level.  It is your
decision to setup your DS where ever you want.

> I need CD/DVD copy protect software,

As far as I know there is no software which gives 100% copy
protection. All copy protection software makes copying difficult(not
impossible). They do this by writing invalid entries into the CD data
structure(not sure the exact details).

But remember it not only makes copying difficult but also normal
playback. It is really painful for genuine buyers to struggle playing
the CD in their players. I've bought many Pebbles/AppleTree rhymes for
my kid only to find out it is not playable with my CD/DVD player
because of copy protection none-sense. Then I had to use vcdxrip to
rip the video as mpeg files and play it.

I think it would be right to put it in courier charge .
Because?
*However, sale or charges for pro?t beyond reasonable

This could be brought under printing cost .?
In the best case , you could ? mail to ?wtrench at trinity.edu. and inform them about this .?
Also try to mail Mr., William F. Trench as it would nullify any copyright provision , if you get the consent of the author .

Knowledge freedom with the academicians and researchers in last three
days. Program highlight was our ex-president's inaugural address. He
discussed about keeping and developing the knowledge in open domain,
which proprietary softwares cannot do. All tutorial sessions and
debates would be published in Free Software Movement of India - FSMI's
website (fsmi.in) soon. FSF-TN website also will have a link to it
once the tutorials are published (fsftn.org).

I have used Drupal in a limited way and do not know all the modules in
details.   I believe the short answer is yes, it can be done perhaps with
some custom modules.

IMO, the best place to discuss your requirements would be in the Drupal
forums and/or mailing lists.  The Drupal Gurus hang out there.

Google lacks

1.privacy it tracks everything even when you aren't logged in your IP
addresses are stored in their db see [1]

2. lots of goodies at [2] for example !bang feature which lets you
search stuff directly over a website like you can search for Debian
packages like !dpackages <package-name> and more such at [3]

Hi,

DuckDuckGo may be good in terms of privacy, Position your product as
security/privacy enabled Search engine

Dont position your product as another search engine like Google, which
doesnt make any sense

It is what DDG people have written on their site may be to make people

Subject: [Ilugc] OAOD (cycle)
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=OFhVubahQb9zwTRRz77QDmqrPw+HKH8KVWM+e@mail.gmail.com>

Application: cycle

what it is:

Cycle is a calendar for women. Given a cycle length or statistics for
several periods, it can calculate the days until menstruation, the
days of "safe" sex, the fertile period, and the days to ovulations,
and define the d.o.b. of a child. It allows the user to write notes
and helps to supervise the administration of hormonal contraceptive
tablets.

Possibilities of the program:

  - Calculate days of menstruation, based on the length of the cycle
or on statistics of previous periods.
  - Calculate days of "safe" sex, fertile period and day to ovulations.
  - Definition of D.O.B. (Date Of Birth) of a child
  - Allows to write notes.
  - Helps to supervise reception of hormonal contraceptive tablets.
  - Multiple users allowed. Data is protected by a password for every user.

NOTE: This program is not a reliable contraceptive method. It does
neither help to prevent sexual transmission diseases like AIDS. It is
just an electronic means of keeping track of some of your medical data
and extract some statistical conclusions from them. You cannot
consider this program as a substitute for your gynecologist in any
way.

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install cycle

Let we start the project.

Here is comparison of various project hosting sites

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities.

and My vote is for Launchpad.

Let we give a good name for the project. Shall we create a poll for this...

I wish to be a one of developer/team member(c++/python). Here I am
very interested in this, because, this is going to be my first
experience in opensource projects. Also, it is supposed we are going
to start from scratch, so I expecting I will get very good experience.
 Please interested people take some responsibilities like TL , PL ,
PM, team member, Admin....

Hi ,

I am planning to host a django website in an Indian server. I am not looking
for VPS or dedicated server as i believe it must be costly. The hosting
provider must be running nginx. He must support adding extra batteries to
django on request. The latency must be less to Indian users. Please help me
in picking up the best.

alien can convert pkg formats (but beware of pkg dependencies).  Since you
mention java, an installed JRE may be sufficient.

XMind is not currently packaged for Fedora, but it is easy to install and run:

Try this

1) Download the ?Portable ? ZIP * (Windows + Mac + Linux)? version.

2) Open a terminal window and cd to the directory you saved the file to.

3) Unzip the file to a directory.

$ unzip -d ~/xmind xmind-portable-3.1.1.200912022330.zip

4) Create a symlink in /usr/local/bin/xmind          so it is easy to
run using ALT + F2.  As root:

# ln -s ~/xmind/XMind_Linux/xmind /usr/local/bin/xmind

Is there a specific reason you'd want to use XMind ? Fedora has Vym
and Freemind packaged.

using a secure public key crypto algorithm? (openssl? GPG?). Will it not
'secure' my data?

This IMO is just fine.  It is a reasonable cost for courier and you are

Subject: [Ilugc] Conducted a Workshop on Python at Rajalakshmi Engg College
	Chennai
Message-ID: <AANLkTik8P69SeXt6bbj5wmfD-yxxbTbOyzH=ON2yfEGR@mail.gmail.com>

Rajalakshmi Engineering College, Chennai is conducting a 3 day
workshop on Python Programming.

I handled the sessions on the Day 2  ? Database Programming.
My friend Sriram handled Object Oriented Programming.

The college conducts a lot of open source workshops and the management
shows much interest on the FOSS advocacy through the students
community.

It is a good sign of change in the growth of FOSS in the academic
world in Tamilnadu.

The students were already trained in python shell, Vim editor, ipython
and other python basics.

I gave a small intro to python using this presentation.
http://www.slideshare.net/arulalan/python-an-intro

They wondered to know that python can do a lot of things including
game, AI, GUI and database programming.

Explained how to start mysql server, how to login to mysql shell, how
to create database, how to create table and view the data.

Then moved to ipython shell, import MySQLdb, create connection and
cursor, execute the SQL queries and the parse the results.

Sriram explored the Object Oriented Programming in Python.
He explained Classes, Objects, Private methods, constructor,
destructor and inheritance etc.

As the sessions were practical with handson, It is so good to see the
students learning Python very fast and they start to build small
applications with their own ideas.

Gave intro to Indian Linux Users Groups, Chennai [ http://ilugc.in ]  and
ChennaiPy  [ http://groups.google.com/group/chennaipy?pli=1 ]
Requested to join the mailing list and to attend the monthly meetings.

Thanks for the great initiative by the college management.
Thanks to Benetict Nicholas and Swaminathan for the arrangements.

You can redirect your web traffic using the proxy settings in IE or FF.

Point it to port 3128 and give the IP of the squid proxy machine.

The other thing would be to do transparent proxying which will not
need you to configure on every browser.

For that you need to redirect outgoing web traffic to localhost 3128 if
 the squid machine is the same as gateway router.

Google is not end of the Search Engine Technology. DuckDuckGo has its own
unique features that Google will not provide.
Try throwing the keyword "Apple" in Google and DuckDuckGo and feel the
difference !!

Here's some very interesting work done on MySQL (not sure
if this is FOSS, but interesting nevertheless):

http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2010/10/using-mysql-as-nosql-story-for.html

This author has supplemented the SQL interface to MySQL
with a light weight NoSQL flavor.  His solution is 2 x faster
than memcached, while retaining the ACID features of
traditional MySQL.  Benchmarks show 750k queries per
second on commodity server hardware.

Best of all, there's already a Perl module to play with this :-)

I do not think so; people do not generally search for single terms, and even
if they do,
how many times do you think people google for apple with the fruit in mind,
most of the
cases it is 'apple' as in a company.

Cognitive sciences and psychology affect technology a lot; and companies
which take
advantage of this would be the winner.

Google is a verb now ; any search engine to enter into this space and gain
the marketshare has to have a
significant value add, and i do not see any of the existing ones to be
comparable with that
of Google. There can be search engines related to niche areas which present
data in a
different way - but note that here the stress would be more on the
'presentation layer' as the UI has to be
tweaked according to the audience's interest(for eg. patents, lawsuits,
genomes, census data)
(generation of suitable metadata for indexes etc is implied).

DDG is good, but not great. Do I like it? Yes(esp the Duck).  Will I use it?
No.

No search Engine is capable enough to infer this . While throwing a keyword
or phrase to a search engine there is a "searchers/ users intention" .
Computer systems can't make any inference about the 'intention'.

I do agree . So why Search Engines like Google provides autosuggest and
related features


> Google is a verb now ;



It is more than a verb now . We can say there is a "googilization" (like
globalization ) and people  addicted to it.




Search Engines like DDG, Hakia, Blekko etc has considerable difference from
Google . Google respects all the SEO professionals and others considers the
real content in the webpage ;-) .

DDG tries to disambiguate the search term and try to classify it . The same
thing is applied in Hakia in a different way . All we follows a circular
search behaviour in Google . DDG and others tries to reduce the cycle in
obtaining the desired search result. There is an interesting book called
"Search Patterns" . Reading the book may give more insight to this .


If somebody brings semantic search (fullfledged ) in to practice that will
be a Google Killer ;-)

hi,

I have been using jquery for some years now, but was always struggling
with the documentation and understanding how to do things - I thought it
was because I did not know javascript properly. Now a person who is a js
expert told me that jquery documentation sucks and advised me to check
out ext core which is very well documented. Any experiences and advice
on this?

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content_management_systems> is a
reasonably updated list of Content Management (and I realize that
you've specifically asked for Document Management) systems. The tables
show the licenses as well. The other option is to look at
<http://www.cmsmatrix.org/> and arrive at a reasonable set of choices.

While you specify two criteria - are there more ? For example,
granular ACL based on roles, export of content and so forth.

I *had* heard of these two sources, but why I asked on this list is for
practical experiences - what are you people using and what is your
experience

the more features the better - but these two are the main ones. The
first because it makes it easier for other applications to talk to the
system and the second because it ensures that the devels are working on
the version we are using.

These are perfectly nice things to have since it would, which I

There isn't a single answer to that question :) Hence I listed out all
the ones I end up accessing during the course of a day. The variety is
driven by differing requirements and needs of each deployment.

 the following jasper packages
Message-ID: <AANLkTinGyVSyep8wrdG2FEwLu7yFjjh=QTQHq8SKp=6s@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

When I installed these packages alone and restarted my ubuntu os on Hp
Pavilion dv2700 laptop, ubuntu got crashed.

Its like, I can see only the tty1. but cant type anything to login.


   1. jasper
   2. libjasper-dev
   3. libjasper-java
   4. libjasper-runtime
   5. openjpeg-tools

My ubuntu got crashed more than 8 times, whenever I installed the above
packages.

Last time, I checked with Linux Mint distro on IBM Lennova laptop also. That
also crashed.

But last time, I recovered the Linux Mint back to normal, by removing those
packages completely
by using live cd.

I need to install jasper library for installing pygrib [1] & [2].

Do any one experienced like this problem.

Do any one know more about jasper ?

If anybody willing to install these packages and will try it means,
please post your experience too.

So that we can report about those packages to ubuntu development team.

does that mean that redhat does not have a centralised DMS? Or is it a
bad idea for a company to have one?

To answer the second question first.

I think that the idea that a company should have a single set of
application stack is a good one. It enables and empowers the IT
department. However, the agility that is provided by a set of systems
within a variety is also something that teams benefit from. As long as
data is not kept within silos making it difficult to cross-talk,
variety could probably be encouraged.

The answer to the first part of the question, like I mentioned
earlier, is that there is no single system.

this looks good:

http://www.openkm.com/Technology.html
pros:
1. no separate 'community' edition
2. supports postgresql
cons:
1. Java (but then the company that it is for is infested with java guys)
2. GPL (but then I will not be contributing code so it is not a real
issue)


Will look into it further and report.

Kenneth,

Jquery is the most easiest javascript framework than others.
Ext Js is one of the best Javascript Framework,
When we are developing application say PHP application we can use jquery
with php. But if we are using Exj Js it will be PHP with Extjs.

Jquery is much faster than extjs. Extjs takes too much of time to load, but
works fast.

Jquery is also well documented.

I have been using Jquery for the past two years and Ext Js for past 6
months. When compared to Extjs i feel jquery as my home.

I can customize anyway i can.

I dunno boys. What to say.

I am certainly not a web developer. I love jQuery and cannot think of
anything else in its place.

It is almost as sweet as Lord Murugan in the Hindu pantheon.

So you know what I mean.

I have not even heard of extjs.

jQuery does not suck. It requires genius to use it. Again just like Murugan who
stands for knowledge.

If you have DHCP from your MODEM,

# dhclient eth0

should do the trick.

It will tell you the ip assigned.

Or else:

# dhclient eth0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0

if you wish to assign the IP 192.168.1.100

And then this will assign the default gateway:

# route add default gw 192.168.1.1

If the default gw is 1.1.

And the name server resolution is handled by the file /etc/resolv.conf

# cat > /etc/resolv.conf
  nameserver 4.2.2.2

That is it.

Hi,
How to configure server/client in ubuntu. I am going to customize
ubuntu to suite our college needs, In order to implement client/server
configuration in that os I got following questions

i)  Admin of server should create the users(name,password) and then on
first login of the user they should be prompted to use new passwords
ii) Can the server be used as windows and client as ubuntu?
iii) How to give access to clients to use internet? (i.e only if the
user got permission from the admin then only they should be allowed to
use internet)

I am not a developer;  my understanding about Launchpad is that it is distro

I want to contribute to this project in Python.

On CGI terms this error would occur if the script trys to write
anything to stderr. If
possible try running the script from command line and validate its output.

Dear all,

I have Ubuntu 10.04 - and have problem in running a windows (testing &
setting software for a particular UPS system) - tried WINE, it is not
executing.

Now downloaded 'dosemu' - installed through synaptic - got installed -
getting the icon in 'applications'.

- when I click to run it - it is not opening at all.
- tried through the terminal - $ dosemu

gives the following :

One of my Friend is running a small company.

He has some 5 systems in his workplace.

They have been using windows in them. he wants to move to linux. so the
senario is that

He need 2 windows systems to run visual studio, photoshop, flash etc.,

It will be good if he have a single windows installed and run two system as
seperate users. he needs linux in all system.

Is this possible in virtualization. Or what else can be done with this
senario.

I did Virtualization and accessed the virtual machine a from remote using
rdesktop, say VRDP. But i n systems i am getting the same screen.

So please suggest me some ideas, on this.

Looks like you are trying to access serial port.

Have you checked device mapping like com1 to /dev/ttyS0 etc. for wine?

I believe that there are a lot of people who are cut off from the IT boom
because of their qualification. Unlike most other core engineering jobs, IT
jobs (except a select few) does not require any special skill sets learnt
over a 3/4 year course and if any is required, it can be attained through a
relatively short training.

Was surprised and laughing when one of my freshers told me that he
was eliminated from a reputed MNC's interview because he had not secured 60%
in his 10th standard school exams. Their loss was my gain. He was one of the
best guys I had and gave me a lot of good output. He was recently hired by
the same company though after the "experience" he had with me. I will not
comment on this because large corporates may have their own reason to do so
however sloppy and lazy it might seem.

Imagine if he is just one case, how many brilliant diploma/arts/science guys
and girls might be benefited. And it is a win-win, it's not that I don't
have my own benefit. I would also clarify that I will never discriminate on
the pay scale for equal jobs based on qualification (but this has raised a
few of problems as "our" people still are not mature enough and believe that
BE's have a royal right to more pay irrelevant to the fact that a BE or a
non BE are providing the same value to our company)

Arun

Ahem. Very long reply. ;)

I do agree that many IT skills can be acquired on the job.

But this is true for any job. Not just IT.

I was educated in electronics and I learnt coding only after my second
job and after
 2 years of working and failing multiple times whenever I had to code.

But that lesson was necessary.

It was silly no doubt.

But then life is unfair and it is good that way for most of us.

I am sure no company can have a fool proof recruitment strategy.

BE is BE.

BE is the single most important thing in a personality. :)

And the college matters too. If you are from a really good college and are not
snobbish on account of it you are a jewel, a rare gem. Alas, such gems just
like diamonds are very few.

Now, it really does not matter what a person learns after BE, but BE
is important
for me.

So I might have to differ from you on that. Sorry.

Most of the bizmen I meet in Chennai are not BEs. I wonder why.

Perhaps BEs have such an easy life that they never get to learn life...

I don't suggest virtualization/emulation or multiseat or multiboot.

Just go for computers that natively run the OS you want.

Hi,

In the recent past, there has been discussion on the Free Software [1]
projects for college students and mentoring them. Amidst all the friends
doing traditional railway reservation and library management system as
projects, when a student comes forward to contribute to free software, some
extra motivation and a good recognition is critical to help go that extra
mile.

@Students: Here comes an opportunity to exhibit your contribution to Free
Software, to the public, FOSS enthusiasts and even hard-core developers from
various domains. You can win exciting prizes too!! As part of Carte Blanche
2011 (the annual  Free Software fest by Computer Society of MIT), there is
an event named *Make It*, just for this.

Students who have developed some free software using any of the free
software technologies can present an on-stage demo of the software here.
This can be any application or a plug-in or any other piece of software, but
a free software. The best 3 software will be provided demo stalls where the
students can demo their product to the visitors. Out of them, the best stall
will be chosen for prize. Certificates will be issued for all participants.

[1] Free as in 'free speech' not as in 'free beer' (applies to all instances
of 'free software' above)

PS: We never mind if you call it open source, but be sure that you give all
the 4 freedoms to the users.

I fully agree with this logic /approach .. here is my experience during
 my early years in running a small software development centre I hired
 one guy who was just a 10th with some diploma as a data entry
  operator,was a keep learner then team lead gave him some books and
  asked him to do some very basic exercises from the dbase books.. over
 the years he lead a team of a few BE's and MCAs and today working as a
 AGM with a leading MNC during the time he just managed to have a  BCOM
 degree against his name.He was just one of my many experiments with fancy 
 qualification tags in my 18 _ years in IT industry

What are you trying to do by typing the above command?

How can you access a /dev file without a sudo or root permission?

Hi,

I am going through the Selinux guide and had this question about the
Bell-LaPadula
model.

It says read down and write up. Just wanted to clarify as to is this secure.
A lower security subject writing to a higher priority object can cause one
to alter binary files and use them according to convenience. For E.g. a
hacker could write a modified version of passwd command and replace the
original one.

Please clarify.

Ashish

Hello folks ,

The Binary Analysis Tool can help to discover what components were used to create compiled code. It uses the same type of approach that gpl-violations.org applies to discover license issues in consumer electronics. This is called 'compliance engineering' and has been documented in the GPL compliance engineering guide released by Loohuis Consulting.

absolute rubbish. I find the best people are from rural areas from some
vague unknown college who have passed in several attempts. The best
hacker I know took about 6-7 years to pass Bsc computer science (he
needed a degree to get a visa).

Hi IlUGC members.

I think this might not be directly related to Linux or Linux user group but will be a related question

I need some recommendation for a good budget laptop which can be used for multipurpose i.e office work, entertainment, games in and also development that involves heavy compilation in Linux. Serial port is preferable.

Please recommend
ofcourse it should run Linux and BSD.. preferably all three BSDs

Thanks in advance and Regards
Manikandan

But be warned that it could get really hot, especially when heavy duty stuff
like compiling is being done.

Oh My God, Are you saying that only Acer exhibits this behaviour ?
if so i need to drop Acer. 
My assumption is that any laptop will get hot with a task which stresses the processor

ZOHO would vouch for that.

I have come around to the view that BE is the bane of our society - it sucks
up the finest minds (to the detriment of all other disciplines) and turns
them into mindless clerks.

  I'm speaking from my experience with two acers after having used a vaio
and a dell. Acer is certainly the hottest. Specifically, the 12" TM 6292,
which is my main laptop becomes uncomfortably hot to even to touch.

I often run a script that generates dummy data for my application and when I
do that, it gets so hot I have to move over to the other laptop! The CPU
temp goes above 85 deg C and the skin temp should be around 40-50 deg C!

To be fair, my other laptop, an Aspire 4736Z does not get so hot - but I do
not use it for heavy duty stuff!

regds,
mano

I can say with confidence from my experience that the Indian BE is the most irrelevant and is of no use for programming. If i take a BE and take a BSc and put them on a programming job, Bsc Maths might do better because Science graduates in literal sense are better thinkers than engineering guys.(No offence meant to engg Graduates.)

I do agree with Kish. Zimbra is an amazing product. Me myself is running 2
Zimbra servers (all network editions) with about 500GB mails & 300+ users
with couple of users with 15GB+ mailbox.
Zimbra email web client appears to be slow while working with old
browsers(IE). If anybody need  my help to identify & solve this issue please
let me know.

This behaviour is strange. I strongly suspect that it is an issue with the OS support on power management. You need certain drivers to put the peripherals to sleep or power save mode which might not have been supported or properly done in Linux.
Did you see the same behaviour in the default windows install that you would have got when you purchased the laptop ? If you did not, then it is an issue of OS/drivers rather than the laptop itself.

No extensive use but it is packaged for Fedora and EL (RHEL, CentOS etc
via EPEL).  So feel free to try it out

Correct.  "Network edition" is a euphemism for the proprietary version.

why would you assume that there was a default windows install? Mine had

At the time I bought the laptop and came across the heat issue, I searched
and came across other reviews of the same model that highlighted it. So, I
just assumed that's how it is!

Any way I can verify its a driver issue? Anyway, I'm planning to upgrade to
Ubuntu 10.10 this week (am on 8.10!) and hope you are right and the heat
issue vanishes :-)

thanks,
mano

Also 9/10 laptops sold must be windows. 
No alternative to windows even today for the common man.

Hi,

It is not the degree that matters. It is the interest towards
coding/programming and IT. But IMHO Ethics is dead and there are no
passionate IT developer in the industry today.

Hi,

I hope TeamViewer is more of a Service than as a product. It requires
the infra to provide/manage the necessary remote desktop session. I
hope FOSS has the best protocols to support them

NX
VNC etc.

You are absolutely right. 
On the other hand today's requirement in Indian software industry is such that you don't need any great software skills or brains. The work that the westerners hate to do is outsourced to india due to cheap labour. which is unfortunately hyped up by the software giants. You can use a 10th or 12th std qualified student for nearly 75% of the tasks that is being done by a BE in big software companies in india.

So very unfortunately, careers in India are not chosen by passion. It is
chosen by the "wealth generation" capacity ONLY. Followed by "ticket to
America". Throw in the MNC giant's ability to pay ridiculously high
salaries, we are heading for total disaster in the next decade. As a person
who was running a core engineering company (my brother runs it now), I know
what is happening. We have to shut down in the future if this continues.

No doubt that the IT industry has done a miracle (I thank it for it) in
creating a "real" middle class in India, but it needs to get more socially
aware and responsible. It is surely no easy task, but something needs to be
done. Don't mistake me guys, I am not asking for the IT salaries to be
reduced. It is killing all small and medium scale core engineering
companies. India requires small and medium enterprises to survive. They are
the real heart of India employing a huge majority of Indians.

This is not a rant and I am not a communist. I am a passionate software
developer myself and I run a small software company who has to make the same
compromises because of the norms. And no, I could not have paid my non-IT
staff in the engineering company IT salaries because my customer will walk
away to another supplier who's overheads will be lower :-)

I will end this with an interesting conversation I had with one of our
electronics technician who was with us for 9 years. He holds a diploma and
is brilliant. This is was what he asked me-

"You are giving me 19K per month and you are giving Karthik (One
year experience, BE, software engineer) 22K per month. Who gives more value
to you?" I had to say "you do, a lot more, but I cannot help it". It was
sad. He left us that year and found another job for the same salary. Just
that he could work more peacefully.

Arun

Ah. There the blinkers "value of degrees" of software industry in the open now.

Considering value is just a perception, The so called IT and ITES
industries have pulled a condom of perception of "value of degrees"
over itself so much so that it refuses to trust and value its own
experience.

Ask PS Deodhar, Founder Chairman of Aplabs, leading India Electronics
company having its own R&D. Their ROI has been Dismal

On the other hand Software industry has been investin more on how to
restrict access to technology to the people.

Look at the case of Read-and-print-only-once e-mail.

There are none as of day in India because of DRM - the draconic
Legistlation which RMS has been shouting about for almost a decade.

Above, IMHO.

I would suggest you to get a retailer version of DELL Inspiron 14"/15"
without any OS
and install OS of your choice. Even for the retailer version you get the
normal DELL
warranty ( along with complete cover protection which is optional). For the
models and
approximate price check the below link ( page 3)

True. common man just asks laptop. 
He does not ask that he needs Linux laptop or FreeBSD laptop.

Take the Mobile example. Android is having the backing of a giant in google and today 1 in 4 smartphones sold is a android phone.
It was an excellent strategy to release a Linux based OS by Google in Android and OEMs grabbed it.
Common Man does not asks that he needs android and kernel version 2.6.32 etc.
The same is not True with respect to Laptops. still windows rules.
There is still no backing from a big guy.

Just get out of your home spend time for 30 minutes to see for yourself on what OS goes into PCs or Laptops.
I have also seen few people buying linux laptops (just to cut down few bucks) and load a pirated version of windows.

Hi, I have just installed Nagios, an open source monitoring system, remotely
in one of my remote virtual system which is running Ubuntu. But, the problem
is, I cannot launch that Nagios with http://120.x.x.x/nagios3/
Here, 120.x.x.x is the real ip of my remote virtual Ubuntu. When I tries to
get the web interface with http://120.x.x.x/nagios3/   then, this message
comes:

Subject: [Ilugc] Setting a default nice value for a user
Message-ID: <1293388198.26571.3.camel@mjolnir>

Hi, everyone,

I'd like to set it up so that every process that a particular user sets
up is niced to 5. I can do this with renice, but the process has to be
repeated every time the user logs in. The only solution that searching
the Internet has yielded is sticking that command in the
user's .bash_login but most of the results are from many years ago.

Is there another way of doing this? I'll do this if there's no better
way but it seems a bit kludgy to me.

Use "priority" and "nice" options in /etc/security/limits.conf.

Hi, Raja,

I've tried this. For some reason it isn't taking effect, though. I login
as the user over ssh (which I reloaded) and execute something at nice 0.

If it will help, I'm using Debian Lenny.

I think this thread can be safely marked OT now, but it's still quite 
interesting :). As for the medium-scale core engineering companies, I 
think slowly, they too are reviving. I'm not an economist, nor I want to 
sound too optimistic, but just want to point out the other aspect of the 
so called evils of the "IT revolution". The middle class (real or not) 
is demanding more hardware and buying up stuff - housing, cars, etc. 
Luckily, we seem to have policy makers who are slightly sane - thanks to 
the 120% percent duty on auto imports, we seem to have a reasonably good 
domestic auto industry that's looking for all kinds of engineering, not 
just IT. Hopefully, we can hope for better policy makers in the future, 
who're not just looking to line their pockets. As an orthogonal point, I 
would also like to point out the irony of lashing out at corruption in 
politics, where in everyday life we are just as happy to break/bend the 
rules for our own gain.

I think the real issue (like you pointed out) is not whether IT is 
destroying a generation of intelligent youngsters who have varied 
interests (who tend to be pushed into IT thanks to social pressures) - 
but as a society, will we have the courage to look at ourselves and 
point out the hypocrisy of chasing dollars above all else (and making 
our kids do the same). I can only hope, the current generation of 
disgruntled IT employee-parents will realise that more money didn't give 
them real happiness they cared about, and will encourage their kids not 
to make the same mistake. Perhaps, it has to get worse before it gets 
better. That's my hope :).

Vamsee.

Hi,
How to configure server/client in Redhat Enterperise server 5.0 . In
order to implement client/server configuration in that os I got
following questions

i)  Admin of server should create the users(name,password) and then on
first login of the user they should be prompted to use new passwords

ii) Can the server be used as windows and client as Redhat Client?

iii) How to give access to clients to use internet? (i.e only if the
user got permission from the admin then only they should be allowed to
use internet)

iv) How to share the Windows files in Linux Server?

The irony is the fact that cars are still affordable because the salaries,
compensations given to Auto sector employees / sub contractors / OEM
suppliers are low (compared to IT). Increase this to IT norms and cars will
become automatically much more expensive and will become unfordable to the
middle class yet again. That's the reason why there has to be inclusive,
sustainable growth (I have started to get a feeling that this is
an oxymoron). This might not be possible at all because it is a vicious
cycle we have ended up in. Growth of one sector should not be at the expense
of the other.

Luckily, we seem to have policy makers who are slightly sane - thanks to

Yes, this is correct. But the import duties have been like this for decades.
Growth in the auto sector has happened only in the last 15 years. It was a
sustained effort by the state government of Tamil Nadu to get the auto
majors in. This is awesome. However corrupt either of the two major parties
are, they did something which created a revolution. Giving employment to
hundreds of thousands. I don't really care about corruption if it leads to
progress.

I agree. Corruption almost always works to our benefit. I don't understand
why people get worked up when they look at major scams. It's very
hypocritical. It's a matter of scale. A drive from my office to home in
Chennai shows me that almost all road users violate all laws and have zero
discipline and don't care about any etiquette on the road. From BMWs to
TVS50s - people don't care to even stop for red signal. Politicians are
after all the same people.

Yesterday I have attended the FOSS meetup in Delhi.

In that many people presented/discussed about some good things.

One student (Anuvrat - cced in this thread) presented his college 3rd year
project and demonstrated.

The project is "Desktop sharing to remote machine(s) over the LAN/WAN ".

He almost completed that project by using g++ , Qt and some more stuff.

He hosted his code and documents here https://github.com/bhanuvrat

I think, he has finished the ground work for creating alternate of
TeamViewer.

If we people guiding him and working together means, surely we can achieve
our goal soon.

I told him about ilugc mailing list and discussion over the alternate for
teamviewer.

He is willing to do this project.

Quote : Once we started to think to do something, that something has already
started by someone
in some where.

It is not just engineering which is poorly taught in India. Every single
degree is very poorly taught.

Very few of the students in any professional field have any interest in
the subject - let alone a love for it and this is made worse by the way
the subject is taught and exams are handled in Indian universities.

I have been told by a person who works part-time as a lecturer (for
architecture) that the college where he teaches as a visiting faculty
forbids him from ever giving any student less than 75% marks in an
internal exam - and this is for a professional degree like architecture.
Also almost all projects and assignments are fudged.

So pretty much anyone who gets into an engineering college will get a
degree even if they don't have the slightest interest or inclination for
the field they have entered.

This is true of even the IT field with most software professionals having
absolutely no interest in CS and related subjects.

Actually, this is the primary reason I read ilugc because I get to read
comments from other software professionals, academicians and students who
seem to share a love for CS. So even though I may not agree with
everything which is said on this list, I learn a lot.

Though that might be true, salaries for better or worse, are decided by 
market/macro-economic conditions more than anything else. I don't think 
salary needs to be the motivational factor for any career - the choice 
is simple (though quite hard) - if money is the motivation, it is 
unlikely a person will be happy no matter which career he/she chooses - 
I'll hazard to say even if they do "succeed" in it.

So I think it's more of a personal/character decision than anything 
else. I've read a rather neat quote I liked recently - it goes something 
like - "don't try to be a success, strive to be of value". I have to 
agree with that. If you can provide genuine value to your 
employer/customer/client, I think most of the money/success issues will 
take care of themselves eventually. And I don't think "genuine value" 
happens  unless you also happen to like the job :)

Vamsee.

But you need to look and work on existing protocols like VNC RDP etc..
this software is good for learning or foundation something but it is far far
and very far from normal setup which we can do using exiting tool. For
example, sending desktop video to icecast server using normal existing tool
gave me 7 second delay in whole operation that too i am using 100x100
resolution. Video transmission is much more efficient then frame by frame
transmission what exactly he is doing.
If you want to make something better or similar to teamviewer then look if
they have made any open protocols or what is the work done which is better
or something very innovative like sending instructional drawing like SVG
rather then depending on pixel...
SVG is a good role and scope in this..

One last point, I am not dictating that what you discuss on mailing list and
what not, but it will be great if you guys can carry all the
contribution+development type of discussion on
http://groups.google.com/group/oscontrib
mailing list or else we can device a better way or platform where we can
discuss this expect.
Also, this is  a suggestion/recommendation . you are free to live whatever
way you want,

Please join Indian Debian mailing list -
http://lists.debian.org/debian-dug-in/

I am now migrating from Ubuntu to Debian because Debian give all things
which ubuntu provide in a stable form.
Debian has three branch
1) Stable
2) Testing
3) Unstable..

Ubuntu and other product are derived from Unstable branch and meant for mass
testing,
Ubuntu never cared about bug and stick to time table, the famous 10/10/10
release were having bugs and they released because they wanted to release it
on time.

Above all, I do not to live with a OS which is controlled by a company who
is targeting on MacOS. Look and feel and behavior of ubuntu is going towards
mac os.
I want to devote my rest of the life for advocating and improving Debian in
India.

Those who want a better look and feel can try latest mint which is also
based on debian  -

I recommend IBM thinkpad. It may look odd, may be heavy but you can run
anything on it.

I found it very good for linux.

Yeah saw the small cute words "OS: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS" and ofcourse the
Ubuntu Desktop on laptop .
Anyways I think "Desktop Linux" atleast from Govt initiatives *is* happening :)

Message-ID: <AANLkTikY03g74qjG7TeaWYQnXZ+VfPBpcwtjnqnRi=A1@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Unison

What it is:

Unison is a simple, lightweight backup program. It is GUI-driven,
which makes it well suitable for new Linux users. It is capable of
backing up files and folders to local and remote locations (via SSH)
and can run scheduled.

Features:

Unison offers several advantages over various synchronization methods
such as CVS, Coda, rsync, Intellisync, etc. Unison can run on and
synchronize between Windows and many UNIX platforms. Unison requires
no root privileges, system access or kernel changes to function.
Unison can synchronize changes to files and directories in both
directions, on the same machine, or across a network using ssh or a
direct socket connection.

Transfers are optimised using a version of the rsync protocol, making
it ideal for slower links. Unison has a clear and precise
specification, and is resilient to failure due to its careful
handling of the replicas and its private structures.

To know more about:

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install unison

It is expensive but worth the money you spend. I own one for the last 5+
years. Apart from occasional LCD issues, none of the other hardware part
had any issues. And for this entire duration, various versions of Debian
was running on this machine without any issues.

This is unimaginably stupid.

Even a 4th standard student knows that!

Please ask meaningful question in the list.

And sorry to be so harsh.

You can either block or allow a site.

Not redirect a site to something else which is totally meaningless.

After all we should have common sense first. Then everything else follows.

Myself is an exact example for the above,  as I have done only Dip. in CSE
and no engineering or other degree, but has been doing successful business
(only using foss) for 7+ years with more than 200+ engineering colleges in

Message-ID: <AANLkTik4ZAaG+di31W6AP3Jd9Mt8yMo_fVd15UFGHT=k@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I work on Pardus Linux at home, and Win XP at work.

Last week I unplugged my Transcend 8 GB pen drive from the USB port of my
Linux machine, while it was still copying files to the drive. (Actually I
was unable to kill the cp command and umount the drive even as root). The PC
refused to shutdown until I plugged the drive out.

Since then the drive became unwritable: Win XP complains "the drive is write
protected".
I can copy files from the drive; but not to the drive.

I am able to mount it on Linux, but it would not unmount.

Please help.

Your OP described the Nagios server with IP number as 120.x.x.x, I
presumed it was in the cloud. ?However, from above post it appears you
have these systems in some kind of a DMZ which has a "public" IP
subnet and that you have a functional Nagios setup i.e. you have
figured out your specific problem in your OP.

http://localhost/nagios?will work only when you are logged into
desktop running the Nagios system.  From any other desktop you will
have to give the IP/hostname.

A clear picture of your network topology is extremely essential to
make any suggestion.

>From the possible solutions you have mentioned:

(a) Reverse Proxy rule is the quickest solution.

(b) VPN will give you a lot more flexibility but also require time to
setup and test.

In your place I would go with option (a).

Message-ID: <426572.59633.qm@web95718.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hi ILUG,Chennai

Again this may be only a indirectly related to Linux.

Can someone suggest a good printer (Black and white only) which is rugged and economical ?
Requirement 
Should work with Linux in a superb manner
Should be able to print 100 to 200 pages per week.
During some weeks, we may not print anything and sometimes we may not print for 1 -3 weeks at a stretch also.
Good support and Low maintenance costs.

Am ready to bear higher initial costs also while buying the printer
I assume that Laser printer is the best...

Regards
Manikandan B

Application: Lyx

What is it:

LyX is an almost WYSIWYG-frontend for LaTeX. It makes the power and
typesetting quality of LaTeX available for people who are used to
word processors. Since LyX supports LaTeX's concept of general
mark-ups, it is even easier and faster to create professional quality
documents with it than with usual word processors. It is also
possible to use LaTeX commands within LyX, so nothing of LaTeX's
power is lost.

You can extend the functionality of LyX by installing these packages:

 * chktex: check for typographical errors
 * dvipost: display tracked changes in DVI format output
 * gnuhtml2latex: import HTML documents
 * groff: improved table formatting in plain text exports
 * linuxdoc-tools: export SGML LinuxDoc documents
 * noweb: import noweb files
 * rcs: integrated version control
 * sgmltools-lite: export SGML DocBook documents
 * elyxer, tex4ht, hevea, tth, or latex2html: export HTML documents
 * texlive-latex-extra: more styles and packages
 * wv: import MS Word documents

To know more about:

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install lyx

Subject: [Ilugc] Small programming doubt
Message-ID: <AANLkTinqQuUmyqpqnnkK-MW1Su8ZhVJia17-8ez-654j@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
This might seem very trivial to many, but not having studied programming
academically  and having learned php through self-study alone all the way
while leaning drupal, I have a small question.

function _nodereference_formatters_fieldset($legend, $value,
$collapsed=TRUE, $description=NULL) {
  //form variable built

  return drupal_render($form);
}

I know I can call the above function with two parameters alone. (1 and 2nd).
This will call the function with NULL value for 3rd and 4th parameter.
However, what I want to know is how do people call this function when they
wanted to put in 3 parameters (1,2 and 4th) and leave the 3rd one to default
NULL?

To say it more clearly, how do people call
_nodereference_formatters_fieldset('some legend', 'some value', 'some
description');  (Please note, 3rd parameter is not description, but a
boolean value in the original function which I want to leave to default.

Thanks,
Shankar

Hello 

I understand that there are many mechanisms for passing data between kernel code and user space code in Linux. But which is the preferred method in 2.6 ?
I know this is a trivial question, but also the most abused one as there are many methods.
Could you please point to some links on this ?

Thanks in Advance

Yes, you are right Mukesh. Sorry for the confusion.

Now coming back to the question again, is there a way to call the
function without setting the third parameter but setting the fourth?
Like below?
_nodereference_formatters_fieldset($legend, $value, , $description)
(third parameter is left blank because it should be set to the default
value 'TRUE'.)


Thanks,
Shankar

Depends on what kind of data you would like to pass. If you want to pass a 
single value at initialization to your driver use a module parameter[1]. If you 
want to pass a tunable parameter, create a /proc entry for your module[2]. If 
you want any other dynamic data passing from user space to kernel space (for 
example communicating with a user space daemon/tool) use copy_[from|to]_user[3].

Besides the announcement of India specific, which you probably have to

I have been using Squeeze (testing) for the past several months and
six months ago I have started installing it in production firewalls -
no issues till date.

Each distro has it's USP - giving us the the freedom of choice.

Mint has two versions - Ubuntu and Debian derivatives.

The binary is incompatible with your Fedora install.

unetbootin was unable to create LiveUSB for openSUSE 11.1 from the LiveCD.

Try this link <http://www.pendrivelinux.com/> for instructions on
specific distros.  Keep in mind that distros do change the liveCD FS
layout.  With openSUSE it has become as simple as dd if=LiveCD.iso
of=/dev/sdX  (where sdX is the pen drive).  YMMV with other distros.

I believe most vendors tout on site tech support [1].

[1] Read the fine print and set your expectations low (speaking from

Hi ILUG-C

I came across Arulalan in a meeting of Delhi LUG who informed me about a
discussion going on in this mailing list on "Alternate for Team Viewer".
Upon his advice I am creating a new thread in the forum.
For my third year project this summer I had created a Remote Screen Sharing
Application.

The source code along with a writeup is available at
www.github.com/bhanuvrat .

I would be very glad to join in on your project if you guys start up with
it.
Awaiting replies.

Do the Canon/Samsung printers cope well with refilled toners?

Our office HP Laser Jet Color cost Rs 20-25k, but original color toner
is Rs 10k per set.  The only way to economically operate a printer is to
run it on cheaper 3rd party toner, and unfortunately our printer runs poorly
on refilled toners.

I have not tried it yet with the newer ones.

Did not have much luck with my decade old HP 5MP either (about 4 years
back).  In retrospect, I think it was mostly due to the operator
(worked out of his home) who refilled it.

The cartridges for the newer models have embedded chips.   There are a
couple of franchises (Cartridge World to name one) in Mumbai that
claim compatibility even for the newer cartridges or money back.  This
is for b/w though.  For my printer cartridges, the cost differential
is about Rs. 400 between refilled and original, so I am guessing they
probably have some OEM alliance with the manufacturers.

There is one CW [1] store in Chennai, you can give it a try

commercial alliance with CW.

That goes for all printers, The Manufacturers have adopted a very
strange policy as to pricing,  during a product launch One of the 
company executive  answered to this question saying one has to choose
between Hi initial cot and low operational costs Vs low cost entry with
Hi operational costs the logic is Low entry cost use then occasionally 
and would not mind hi  operational costs (like personal printer of 
an MD /GM etc,) on the contrary a hi cost printer is usually part of
the operational team and the cost of these toners are generally low. 

NONE of the vendors advocate refilling toners / cartridges and warranty
is VOID when a problem is found due to such use (personal Experience)  

The refill business is there to be used at YOUR OWN RISK as every one
has to survive in today's competitive WORLD.

Am sorry for the lengthy Reply.

i think most imp part in this project is support in terms of funding ,
infrastructure and information about network .

1) He can generate some paltry sum by charging people who come for the
events.
2) We can give him support from the organizational perceptive think of orgs
like Sarai,CC,NRCFOSS, POSSE, CDAC or people with commercial interest too i
see some alignment here.
3) Support her/him with donations .

Yes, we are anyway helping G T rao and his dedication but Project FOSS-Yatra
is 1 level ahead. We are trying to setup a platform (by website, mail and
mobile contact) so that other G T Rao from all over India can jump all
together. Each covering every state and putting all success stories on
community website.

Well, it's the same business model that Gillette uses - sell razors for 
cheap (100 bucks with cartridge) and make money on the cartridge 
(proprietary loading mechanism - nice touch, no?) which sell for around 
90 bucks each. From what I heard so far, the cheapest way to operate 
printers is to buy a black & white laser printer (and *never* a 
color/deskjet) and use after-market refills. If you void warranty, don't 
worry about it, your printer has almost negligible resale value with an 
empty cartridge any way. Just consider that your investment in a printer 
has 100% depreciation :)

Vamsee.

Dear all,
     You must be aware of new project http://fossyatra.in
The idea is simple, go to village and city and advocate for GNU/Linux.
website lists some recent seminars by G T rao.
We want your guys or the guys/gals who are doing same work can have a
common listing on website.
Going to such cities all alone (thats what G T rao is doing) is
difficult but not impossible. We are helping him from backend like
finance/material/contacts etc
He also learned tricks like
* Dharmshala or Mandir or similar places you can stay free.
* Gets contacts from local journalist from DIT - District information center.
* Meeting Guys Like Director of college, Lala of City or district
collector directly  ans says we are doing this work form non-profit
help a lot.
* In 3-5 days one can generate new workshop or seminar. G T rao is
earning is most basic money from donations from workshop.
* College and school contacts can be sent back to us so that we can
send Live CDs, Material etc.
* We need more persons like G T Rao who are doing this full time.
* We need persons who can go to back their villages and city and do
seminars. Once in their whole year. Its doable.
* We need highly passionate people who want to contribute to FOSS by
going to village and city level.

Thanks

If it is NTFS, you can use the NTFS-3G fuse driver for read/write on the FS.

Smiley Face Bash Prompt

\[\e[31m\]O_O\[\e[0m\]; fi\`[\u@\h:\w]\\$ "

If your last command was a dud, your bash prompt will be angry at you.
Otherwise it's happy. Soon you will crave its constant approval and
your linux skills will improve simply to avoid low self-esteem.

To set this as default, edit your ".bashrc" file and add it.

Ex:

^_^[Student at mercury:~]$ echo "Linux Rockzzz"
Linux Rockzzz
^_^[Student at mercury:~]$ ;echo "You want windows"
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `;'
O_O[Student at mercury:~]$ echo "hehe"
hehe

There's no such thing as a "best tool".  It all depends on what features
you need.  Here are 3 ticketing systems for you to evaluate:

1. mantis -- mantisbt.org
2. bugzilla -- bugzilla.org
3. request tracker -- bestpractical.com/rt

Dear Narendra,

Thank you for your gift of USD 2.00 to the Wikimedia Foundation,
received on December 31, 2010. I?m very grateful for your support.
Your donation celebrates everything Wikipedia and its sister sites
stand for: the power of information to help people live better lives,
and the importance of sharing, freedom, learning and discovery. Thank
you so much for helping to keep these projects freely available for
their more than 400 million monthly readers around the world.

Your money supports technology and people. The Wikimedia Foundation
develops and improves the technology behind Wikipedia and nine other
projects, and sustains the infrastructure that keeps them up and
running. The Foundation has a staff of about fifty, which provides
technical, administrative, legal and outreach support for the global
community of volunteers who write and edit Wikipedia.
Many people love Wikipedia, but a surprising number don't know it's
run by a non-profit. Please help us spread the word by telling a few
of your friends.

And again, thank you for supporting free knowledge.

Sincerely Yours,


Sue Gardner
Executive Director

You can try OTRS or OSticket both of them are ticketing system with
escalation and various methods to raise ticket request.

OTRS is more customisable so will be little more complexed compared to OSticket,

All of them work nicely for help desk scenarios as well.  It's just a
matter of customizing the field names and workflows.

If it is related with Customer Relation Management, you can look at
OpenERP's CRM feature.

Chennai, Birla planetarium authority Mr. Lenin Organized One hour FOSS
session with Kids(7th to 9th) on Dec 30 2010. Shrinivasan asked me to
conduct this session. This program only for Kids. So I called Mr.
Selvamani to accompany with me. ?I went there early morning 9 am. The
session was started at exactly 10am. ?At beginning what I thought is
"All kids are looking small, so they does not know anything about
Operating system. So It will take so hard to make them clear
understand about Linux". But after started to take session I felt that
my thought is wrong. Everyone of there had experience with Windows.

Me and Selvamani started to talk with student with the as usual story
of Ritchard M Stalman and Linus Torvalt. Everyone impressed with
Linux. I showed Ubuntu and its compiz features. Then we played
BigBugBunny animation clip. All kids enjoyed this.

Next question session. Followings are some question, which I never
expected from them

1. At the session I explained about kernal orally. A 8th standard
student asked me that " How can I see the source code of kernal?".
Thats it, a few second I was kept silent.
2. How can I install linux in my system?
3. Where can I get help regarding linux?
4. Some kids said, can you give your mobile number? I will call you
with my dad, and elder brother and exp
5. How to play games?
6. One student asked me a critical question that is "Linux is a free
OS and have all kinds of softwares, then Why it is not famous. I mean
why we dont know about linux?
7. Will Linux affect by virus?

Really amazing. right?

At the end of the session we met another unexpected incident that is Some
kids came forward to asked us "Autograph". What to say? That was my
memorable day........

Ubuntu is Good but when you give to newbies, he may face problems,
List is very long.
What is why we tried to create SchoolOS which contains everything which
child need with good configuration.
I suggest you for having a try on SchoolOS. Also, Please send me your postal
address so that I can send you its DVD.

Here is a huge information we have put on our wiki
http://wiki.schoolos.org, you can also add your experience there too.
Most important, you need to install GNU/Linux and observer their problems.
Like newbies do not get any clue how to configure IP address even though it
is very easy. Same with Hindi typing etc. It looks a blackbox to child if
nobody is there to teach them. That why newer version include helpful pdf
files on right on desktop so that student can directly get those help.

I do not find any point in teaching kernel OR other concept to child. ICT is
meant for help in education and not for making computer engineers.

Great !! A detailed tutorial is there in SchoolOS which he/she can follow to
install. This is how we can make permanent answer to these questions.

How about Short cut on Desktop on clicking , it will open ##linux-India IRC.
? any other suggestion ?

OpenAreana, SuperTux, TuxMath, Tuxkart (i forget exact name) -
See here -

Because Linux/FOSS/GNU is made by all of us and we do it for non-profit.
Company system do not find much benefit out of this in promoting. Same with
Govt at some places.
GNU/Linux depends on us and we need to spread it. Somebody told about Linux
to me and I used it. I am not a fan of it, you use it, And tell your friends
about it.




> 7. Will Linux affect by virus?

Virus comes when there is close source. FOSS/OpenSource has lots of
developer who keep solving bugs.
This sentence is 87.234 % Correct and can be used for satisfying
their curiosity.

I used Drupal Quiz[1] around Jan 2010 and Quiz 4 RC 1 sufficed my
requirement having standard set of features, mostly stable. It should be
straight forward to install and configure it. I was having some issues with
Export / Import and now i see its developed as a seperate module. Never
tried offlate.
