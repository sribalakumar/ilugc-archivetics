One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

c++decl -- Create/Explain C++ Type Declarations.

Summary:

Cdecl is a program for encoding and decoding C/C++ type declarations
in English language. Both cdecl and c++decl are same program. cdecl
will use C notation and c++decl use C++. It can run in interactive
(shell-like) and non-interactive mode (command line arguments).

In the interactive mode, cdecl will wait for your input in "c++decl> " 
prompt. Enter "quit or exit" to exit. Enter "?" for help.

Examples:

$ c++decl -- Start the c++decl in interactive mode.

c++decl> quit -- Exit c++decl.

c++decl> declare i as static integer 

c++decl> declare x as reference to pointer to character

c++decl> declare foo as pointer to member of class X int

c++decl> explain class Y *(X::*foo)(arg1, arg2)

$ c++decl -c declare signal as function returning int -- Create 
                            compilable C or C++ code as output.

Read: man c++decl

Message-ID: <3E42409C-776E-4477-BF65-0D46D2832C22@gmx.net>

Hi,

I have installed Fedora-10 on my hp pavillion laptop. I would like to  
know how to change (reduce the brightness) of the initial login screen  
(gdm). It goes to full brightness when boots to the login screen. I am  
able to use the keys function keys to reduce it. But I would like have  
it configured to a required brightness level and settings be retained  
after reboot.

I am able to change the brightness after logging into the (gnome/KDE)  
session and save the setting. But I wanted to control it for the login  
screen and save it globally.
I think xbacklight utility (xclient)  should help here, so I would  
also like know where to place the startup applications for gdm. Or is  
it possible to do that with X server (xorg.conf) itself.

Thanks

I have nothing better to do in life at the moment so I ask:

Why in MSWORD?

Is it impossible to read plaintext? ;)

BTW this reminds me. Several years ago I had my profile in .txt format
and a lady consultant 
would keep on insisting that she never got my profile and I
kept on insisting that she got it.

What was happening was that her mail client was inspecting the MIME type
and appending it inline with my mail text. 
(I had to give up after a while.)

PDF is a nice format for resume.

You can either use LaTeX or even POD(Plain Old Documentation) with perl
to create PDF.

Of course some of you will prefer OpenOffice to create PDF.

You shouldn't need to do this. 2.6.27 already has the gpsca driver 
merged in the upstream kernel. If you are using Fedora (or any recent 
distribution for that matter), refer

Message-ID: <fce946780812010253u53880571la55930a064616f4@mail.gmail.com>

Hello guys,

             There is some problem with display rendering in ubuntu 8.10, my
system takes long time to respond when i have too many windows opened though
i have 2 GB RAM  also i cant enable visual effect actually i dont need fancy
visual effect normal display is more than enough

here the output of lspci
sivaji@hostname:~$ lspci | grep -i vga
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation
82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE Chipset Integrated Graphics Device (rev 01)

After searching on ubuntu forums i came to know that installing
"xserver-xorg-video-intel" will fix my problem but it didnt work for me.
sivaji@hostname:~$ sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel
[sudo] password for sivaji:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
xserver-xorg-video-intel is already the newest version.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.

Most of the time my system load i.e average load : 3 (as per "uptime"
command and gnome-panel applet ) and xorg process consumes more than 30% of
cpu cycle.
Display resolution is  1280x1024 refresh rate 60Hz. There is nothing
specific to say about xorg.conf.
monitor is viewsonic 17''

I also tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg but there is no
improvement.

Hardware drives manager  says that no priprietory driver are in use

Please suggest me some solution.

Presently I have need to build up a Linux NAT box, over which I could be 
able to run almost all common application including FTP, peer-to-peer 
application (voice and video chatting) etc. Now I do something like 
this: if a particular application is failing, I trying to add the 
correspoding ip_nat modules. Say a SIP based application fails, I add 
nf_nat_sip and nf_conntrack_sip.
What I want know is there some systematic way of doing this which would 
comprehensively take of all classes applications?

I think he has been sending for close to four months now. We have to
check the archives. I am saying it from the top of my head.

The entire LUG is archived very well at

http://ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc

I guess that should do.

Moreover there also pearls of wisdom all over the Internet. People have
to take the time to learn.

That is all.

Protocols like SIP, FTP, RTP and other broken protocols that negotiate
port numbers in the payload (this includes all of RPC protocols
including NFS of course) need special handling in the firewall/NAT box.

I dunno a thing about linux firewalling but it is really really messy...

IPTables has NAT helpers or ALGs for precisely these reasons. It is easy to
do and there is no need to think of it as messy. One needs some time and
resolve, thats it. In case you want a packaged distro for the edge that does
this and a lot more, look at Untangle.

If I remember correctly, he had been doing this for years since I joined 
ILUGC at least 5 years ago (will I don't remember that correctly, should 
be more).  At least I have a huge back mail archive (thunderbird's) of 
ODOC sent by Bharathi. Am not sure whether he starts the cycle again 
when he gets done with his set of ODOCs.

Hello

Yesterday, one of our ILUGC member sent a mail asking me to check the 
/var/log/message about the "tty", I had missed that mail and somehow it 
is not retrievable.
May I request that gentleman to resend the same mail so that I can 
explore further on this issue?.

Hey,
    I was wondering if I can "connect" to one of the /dev/tty's
(/dev/tty0, /dev/ttyUSB0) and at least read data from it. I want to do
two things:

1) I've sshed into my computer, and I want to check out  what's
happening on some terminal (say tty0), *not* running screen.
2) I want to get raw output from a serial port (or a usb port).

Cheers,

Note that all instructions assume that the user you ssh as has
read/write access to all the devices.

To interact with a Linux virtual console you can run "conspy".
So you can to something like
 ssh my_computer conspy
to see the currently active virtual console or
 ssh my_computer conspy 23
to the 23rd virtual console /dev/tty23 on.

Note that this only works if the virtual console is in text mode.

To get access to the X server which is running on the console
you need to run x11vnc on the machine.
 ssh my_computer DISPLAY=:0 x11vnc
You then invoke a vncviewer on your local machine.
 vncviewer my_computer:0

For "raw" I/O piped back and forth from a modem you could use
 socat readline /dev/ttyUSB0,raw,echo=0,crlf,nonblock

It may be possible to use socat for /dev/tty0 as well.

Regards,

Kapil.

Not sure of any free website which lets you do that but if you have
your own hosting space then you can install wordpress on it and
configure it to post via email. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be
available, or atleast not free of cost, on wordpress.com.

Hi All,

"Announcing Hack-a-thons at Insignia 3.0- Hackerdom"

While attempting to chalk out a list of talks in keeping with our motto :
"Come a User, Return a Hacker", we were faced with the question of how to
introduce a user to the hacker culture in a simple and understandable
manner. And Voila!, the Hack-a-thon was born.

Hack-a-thon is where the Hackers go into the crowd and guide the users to
hack with them.
We will be setting up sessions introducing the concepts of mailing lists,
bug reporting, submitting contributions, documenting problems and giving
them practical experience in doing things the hacker's way.
We invite Hackers, Localization Teams and other interested parties to set up
small guidance sessions where you will be able to help users, students and

Hi All,

"Announcing Hack-a-thons at Insignia 3.0- Hackerdom"

While attempting to chalk out a list of talks in keeping with our motto :
"Come a User, Return a Hacker", we were faced with the question of how to
introduce a user to the hacker culture in a simple and understandable
manner. And Voila!, the Hack-a-thon was born.

Hack-a-thon is where the Hackers go into the crowd and guide the users to
hack with them.
We will be setting up sessions introducing the concepts of mailing lists,
bug reporting, submitting contributions, documenting problems and giving
them practical experience in doing things the hacker's way.
We invite Hackers, Localization Teams and other interested parties to set up
small guidance sessions where you will be able to help users, students and
other hackers, begin contributing to your project.

  NOTE: Hack-a-thon is not a developer meet developer coding session ! It is
where you help others to learn the art of hacking and contribution.


Cheers,
Hacker

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

apt-cache -- Debian APT (Advanced Package Tool) package handling
             utility.

Summary:

apt-cache performs a variety of operations on APT's package cache.  
apt-cache does  not  manipulate the state of the system, but does
provide operations to search and generate interesting output from 
the package meta-data (/var/lib/apt/lists).

Examples:

$ apt-cache search xfree86 -- Show package info and descriptions for 
                              the search-string (xfree86).

$ apt-cache policy gcc -- Show version and priorities of the available 
                          Packages.

$ apt-cache show postgresql -- Show detailed description of postgresql
                               package.

$ apt-cache showpkg mozilla -- Show all kind of dependencies for the 
                               Mozilla package.

$ apt-cache depends mozilla -- List the packages needed by Mozilla.

$ apt-cache rdepends kde -- List all packages that needs KDE.

There is a way to do it with  xvctl(1) but it is only for videos. Not

Hi,

While the sum of money is accumulated with the investor, the sum of
knowledge in the form individuals is extremely difficult to unite for
wide range of reasons, which the investors exploit (for individuals
involved seldom come together against investors' exploitation).

How would an Employee Agreement of a FOSS company differ from a
Proprietary Company? While its total surrender of everything at
Proprietary Companies for a monthly salary how are FOSS comapanies
different in this regard?

Can successful FOSS entrepreneurs & employees at FOSS only campanies
like Redhat (not forcing if you really want to go by any
Non-disclosure agreement with your Employer) share their experiences?

For one, if they are FOSS companies, they are going to publish your work 
under a FOSS license. The agreements that I have seen so far, tend to be 
a lot more flexible.

It's tough to convince otherwise when you're coming from that point of 
view. Why do you think investors only exploit? They spot an opportunity, 
and they put in money to exploit the opportunity, not the people. If 
some exploit people in that pursuit, you have to blame that particular 
individual, not investors in general. It's possible to do business 
ethically, you know :).

At least in mine, all code that gets done for clients is closed, and the 
clients have full rights over it, and all code that gets contributed 
back to FOSS projects is open. And it's done on the company's dime. We 
just stick an MIT licence to it. Actually, there are plenty of startups 
that work this way.

Nice!

So xterm sessions would not work? Is it because this only works for "real" ttys,
and not pseudo ttys? (ptys)

I tried it on a pts, and it atleast managed to write to that console. However,
it failed to read... from the same. Thank you for the pointer though, I'm
definitely going to explore more into this.

Thanks all!

The first argument of mine is substantiated by the argument that
followed and your reply holds good if the agreement between the
employee and employer aren't the typical proprietary ones. It that
agreement is a typical proprietary one, that asks the employee to
surrender everything, then the system which encourages that need to be
blamed. If that's the system the investor chooses to follow? (May be I
can express better in Tamil, if this is unclear)

Agreeable. But that's not what I asked for. I would like to now "Are
Employee - Employer agreement different in a FOSS company compared to
that of a Proprietary Company?, If so How? and on What aspects?"

first define what is a 'FOSS company'? The term is unclear. A company that 
opensources all the code it produces? Then neither the employer nor the 
employee get anything out of the code in terms of IPR. But such a company 
will not last for more than 5 minutes. 

if by a 'FOSS' company you mean one that exclusively uses FOSS tools - as long 
as it doesnt opensource the code it writes, it is no different from a 
proprietary company.

Take, for example, the company that owns django. They also have a product 
called ellington which runs on django. Programmers work both on django and 
Ellington. All the django work goes to the community, the Ellington work is 
owned by the company - so the company is a FOSS company in so far as it pays 
for Django coding and a proprietary company otherwise.

I personally feel that your question can never be answered as there can never 
be a FOSS company.

Originally Cygnus and then Red Hat, Mozilla Corporation and others have

What would you say on talks and sessions organised by people around at
various Conferences on "FOSS business models"? I was thinking those
invited to talk at those sessions are such people who run business
with FOSS. Shouldn't theirs be called a FOSS company? or is all of
those a hype?

If FOSS company is not the right word, What should then we name any
kind of establishment/ setup that might come out of such initiatives?

It's not like I worked at a ton of companies, but in ours, when we 
recruit, we specifically state in the employment contract that the 
company rescinds all rights on work that is not directly related to the 
client project and is meant to be open sourced. But I'm not sure if 
that's a practice widely adopted. We work with freelancers too, so I 
just wanted to make sure open source contributors felt comfortable and 
perfectly safe working for our company, at the same time protecting the 
clients' interests.

You should understand that it's possible that a company be a foss 
'consumer' and not be a contributor at all. They still have a foss 
business model, but probably not such a good open source citizen.

Well, that would be just splitting hairs. A company exists for solely 
one thing: making a profit. How they make that profit, as long it is not 
illegal, is up to the company. If you like what they're doing, join/buy. 
Otherwise, stay away :)

I am sorry I can't understand the context of the term 'exploitation'. Do you
mean to say that that in prop software companies - (a) In monitory terms,
the investor makes way too much money and parts with very small amount to
the employees and you belive this is wrong like a union? or (b) In
knowledge/philosophy terms that the knowledge gained or IP generated in a
project is 'owned' by the investor but not the employee? And the employee
cannot use it for his or her own benifit?

How ever you look at it-

I belive knowledge should be free and shared. I run a fully owned company
myself and I have the power and capacity to make my principles the
principles of my company. Profit or loss, both or mine.

In most software companies... read corporates - are faceless entities run
with huge sums of money invested by the investors. The primary goal of any
corporate entity is profit, profit, profit. That's why they exist. The
professionals who run these companies are evaluated based on thier ability
to maximise profit. Unless the FOSS company is non-profit or run through a
fund, I guess employee agreements would be very simlar. But correct me if I
am wrong if I thought that any run-for-profit FOSS company will be based on
support?

I know there are exceptions, but they are very few. I deal with corporates
everyday and they are all the same greedy entities whether their base is
Automotive/Software/Pharma......... Again, I am only talking about greed and
not ethics.

can you confirm that all code produced by Red Hat is opensourced? If so, 
obviously neither the programmer or the company directly gets money out of

Let's assume that is true but it still disproves the notion that pure 
open source entities are not sustainable. That was shattered by Cygnus 
back in 1989.

Hey first of thanks for you and Rahul for sharing what is happening at
your respective Organisations.

and it appears, you split my trunk and create branches out of it
hanging your own swings.. I am not going to have a ride on them ;-)

I had just replied to Kenneth on what is a FOSS company :-)

Thank you again for sharing your company's position. Expecting more
replies on the question that I raised on Employee - Employer
agreement. Others are deviations. I had caused few of them I
apologise.

Hi !

I am not sure if Foss companies have different Employee - Employer
agreements. I am not able to see why the business model should affect
the basic Employer - Employee relation. I work with quite a few small
companies which work in true FOSS style ( again -according to me
where the product is fully open source and free and they make money by
support , subscriptions etc) and they are doing well and in high
spirits too !

They get their paychecks every fortnight ! Most of the guys I know are
"real power houses" and very passionate about their work and need no
extra incentives like non-foss companies !

Interesting topic

Cheers

let us not assume - yes or no? Does Red Hat opensource all the code produced

I am not aware of any proprietary product developed by Red Hat.

You are missing the context.  What I was assuming to be true for the 
sake of the discussion is that direct revenue from FOSS is not possible 
which isn't correct anyway as my Cygnus reference showed.

I don't see how that is relevant. That makes no sense anyway. I haven't 
seen RMS advocate "FOSS" as a term. He prefers "Free Software". You 
can't patent a "keyword" and such generic words cannot be trademarked 
either.

And LFY has an 8.10 multi-bootable DVD which has Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu

I am not sure about gdm, but I use xdm, and adding 'xbacklight -set <val>' to
my login manager's Xsetup file did the trick.
I have a xdm theme, so the location is /etc/X11/xdm/archlinux/Xsetup.

You just have to find out your login manager's X init scripts location and add all
that you want to Xsetup.

I am part of a FOSS based consultancy. We work only with FOSS technologies. Even our development environments are Fedora and Ubuntu. We only have one laptop with Windows (bundled when bought). We use that laptop for IE compatibility.

We do have agreements where employees assign all copyright to firm. We then further handle it. All our employees are encouraged to contribute to FOSS projects whether related to rknowsys or not. Around 98% of internal code is released as FOSS. Some minor parts are held back for various considerations.


We can have a more meaningful discussion if the question is clear else the answer is 42.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

dpkg -- A medium-level package manager for Debian.

Summary:

dpkg is a medium-level tool to install, build, remove and manage
Debian packages. The primary and more user-friendly front-end for 
dpkg is dselect(8).

Examples:

$ dpkg -l vi* -- List packages matching given pattern.

$ dpkg -I vim.deb -- Show vim package information.

$ dpkg -c vim.deb -- List the vim package contents.

$ dpkg -S /usr/bin/gcc -- Show which pkg is installed gcc.

$ dpkg --print-avail vim emacs -- Display details about package, as 
                                  found in /var/lib/dpkg/available

# dpkg -i vim.deb -- Install the vim package.

# dpkg -r elvis -- Remove the package.

# dpkg-reconfigure xfree86 -- Reconfigure the X Package.

# aptitude -- Console interface to APT package management.

# synaptic -- GUI to APT package management.

Read: man dpkg, aptitude, synaptic

I'm going to hate you for that! :) It should be

# dpkg -i elvis.dev
# dpkg -r vim

Thank you Sujith, Girish and Kapil for extending help.
I added the "xbacklight" utility to /etc/gdm/Init/Default file and  
that did what I wanted.

good read - note I am *not* indulging in Red Hat bashing which is the 
favourite occupation a certain type of person. I am wondering about things 
like code that is used in-house - does it get open sourced automatically - if 
not, what is the implication wrt being a FOSS company? 

My personal business model for whatever business I do is to only accept jobs 
from customers who agree to open source the code. (of course, the agreement 
includes a clause that such part of the code that exposes their business 
secrets will be excluded from open sourcing and also the product open sourced 
will be a generalised version of what they are using). In such circumstances 
it is irrelevant to my employees/consultants as to who gets rights in the 
code. Normally, since the customer has paid for it, the copyright would be 
his - but since most of the code is anyway copy pasted from other FOSS code, 
there is very little share of the copyright for the customer. This works fine 
with the BSD license - I don't even want to think of the implications if the 
GPL is used.

It would not be much different under GPL, either. Except you are
forced to give the customer the complete source code. When you release
the code to everyone, you gets to decide what goes out. You can even
keep all of it for yourself - you are obliged to give the code only to
those who gets binaries from you.

        I have been working for a company for the last 8 years that
 produces code that is all under the GPL.  My primary activity is to
 write code to support the tasks we have been contracted to perform.

        The company was founded in 1972. Seems like a very very long
 five minutes to me.

Historically, custom infrastructure code has been considered different 
from public products but if it solves one organization's problem it 
probably is useful to others as well.  I know atleast a few projects 
that has been written in-house by the infrastructure team and then made 
available as a public project.

One recent example would be

https://fedorahosted.org/genome/

The implication of being a FOSS company is that, there is a culture of 
doing exactly this. The default choice would be to make everything 
public. There might be a few exceptions for various reasons but nothing 
that significantly changes the sustainability of a business that 
operates this way.

yes, certainly more than 5 minutes ;-) - could we have some more details about

cool - so there would not be any NDAs? Do the employees have to hand over the

It's been a while since I signed one. I will check the contract again 
and get back to you.

Yes, I'm also interested in knowing who owns the copyright--the company or the 
coder? As some free software does carry a tag of copyrighted by the vendor 
rather than an individual or a group of individuals. So, how is it decided 
whether a project should be a copyright of the FOSS company the coder is 
working for, or the coder's copyright instead?

Best,
Atanu

Yes you can install any of those 5 distros from the DVD w/o burning another 
media. They will all show up in the first boot screen. You select which one 
you want to boot. 

The only exception is the Edubuntu image, which is an iso. This is because 
Edubuntu is distributed as an add-on CD image for a typical Ubuntu install, 
and not as a live or installable CD.

Hi !

Are you interested in simple windows PPTP VPN client ? Then it is very
straightforward in Ubuntu.
Something like Cisco etc may be more involved.

If you are setting up only the client you need to know what the
server is using. The client you have installed is for Cisco's EasyVPN
server.  There is another client network-manager-pptp for MicroSoft's
VPN and yet another for OpenVPN.

Authentication for any of these can be based on password or
shared key or private/public key with ssl certificate.

To use an ssl certificate you need to
 - create your own ssl private key preferably encrypted with a
 password.
 - create a certificate signing request.
 - send the certificate signing request to a CA whose authority is
 accepted by the VPN server.
 - install the signed certificate sent to you by the CA in a place
 with can be accessed by the network manager.

I have not used network-manager for this but I am told that it can
make the above steps easy.

Regards,

Kapil.

1. Ramadass is pointing to a company built on FOSS foundation with a business / business model(s) on top of it. 

2. NDAs and other agreements are the details of roles and responsiblites to be played by employer & employee. Unless this is clear - issues on code ownership, contribution, motivation and committment will be vague, may lead to disputes later.

3. K C Ramakrishna and KG Sir are working with their own models. Having or not having an NDA is upto the employer.

4. Emp - Emp relations, is like a Man seeking a woman to produce babies. What the Man does with the babies is upto him. Whether he puts him in the Army - open source ,(or) put him in the family business - closed source  (or) put him in the top 10 mnc and make money( part open source) is upto the Employer-company. Business models need not come in the picture of NDA.

all help is available on the wiki on the way to upload tracks and make

?????.

Sirs,

We are in an era where, companies themselves are traded.

See what happened in recent Spectrum allocation. A nothing was given
everything and all that is happening we all know.. Err.. OT

The employees are not at all aware of what management does.. whether
it is trading the product developed or the company itself..

Let us take the example of SUSE. Not many of us would have opposed it
when it existed as SUSE. But Novell took over it. Makes an agreement
with M$ We find our own people boycotting it.

Time and again concerns are raised about KDE over QT, Trolltech's
acquisition by Nokia etc., How it will be in future etc.,

What happens, all those who would have contributed to a Free Software
project as employees/ contributors are destined to accept the
decisions of new management that takes over, which never ever put
efforts other than the money?

Sure, Employees with get Salary even from the new management but won't
FOSS be at stake.

There are other sides of  coin too. Sun which was another M$ by itself
realized advantages in being open and we all Welcome it now.

I have read GNU projects too asking the contributor to give the
copyright to GNU itself.

But we are sure from the recent statements of RMS at fsf-friends
mailing list that it is not going to be democratic in the sense that
it is not going to excise power. He is a Western Rishi himself :-)

Also it cannot be taken over as FOSS companies might be taken over by
other. What is the guarantee that a FOSS company has for its survival
that it won't be taken over by some one who might not FOSSY as its
predecessors were.

We do not have a common association that protects the interests FOSS
based companies to protect their common interests and thereby FOSS
itself.

We have this NASSCOM which says,

//Nasscom is the premier organisation that represents and sets the
tone for public policy for the Indian software industry.//

And it should not be allowed to set the tone and those in FOSS
business should set the tone, I wish.

It took a decision in favour of OOXML are reasons etc.,

More to ponder. I stop here for the moment.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

install -- Copy files and set attributes.

Summary:

'install' will copy single/multiple source(s) to destination, sets
permission modes & owner/group and take backup of existing files. It
is very useful for writing the install scripts.

Examples:

$ install myfile Dir1 -- Copy myfile to Dir1 with same name.

$ install myfile test -- Copy myfile to test.

$ install -b myfile test -- Copy myfile to test. If test is already 
                            exists, then take a backup (test~).

$ install -b -S.bak myfile test -- Same as above. But backup file will 
                                  created with .bak suffix (test.bak).

$ install --backup=t myfile test -- Take numbered backups (test.~1~).

$ install -p myfile test -- Preserve the access and modification time, 
                            while copying the file.

$ install -m 444 myfile test -- Copy myfile with specified permission 
                                mode. Default is 755.

$ install -g newgrp myfile test -- Copy myfile and set GID is newgrp.

$ install -s mybin test.bin -- Strip the symbol tables from installed 
                               binary executables.

Read: man install

HTH :)

+1. So you mean to say the Father (or Man, however you keep) can do 
whatever he wants with the baby (or the child, as it grows) and the 
Mother has no say in it. In this case, it obviously restricts the 
freedom of both Mother (as she has more things to do with getting the 
child out alive and living) as well as the Baby itself (yes, every born 
human on earth has some fundamental freedom and rights). Keeping in 
terms of your analogy, we shouldn't mind if someone takes their baby and 
crushes is putting under a lorry, and not oppose it because it's his 
baby. (Whoa, long live your humanity).

tatindicom usb is reliable all over India - speeds are about 150. Their 
website is 100% linux friendly and so is their USB modem. (Their website was 
only 80% linux friendly, but when we brought it to their notice, they put a 
team on it and rectified all the defects within a week.)

Mandriva recognises the modem as /dev/ttyACM0 - all you need to do is fire up 
kppp, accept all default settings, select /dev/ttyACM0 as the modem and put 
username=internet, password=internet and phone number=#777. Click connect and 
you are online.

I have to admit, I find this discussion a bit amusing. It's like a lot of high nosed psudeo-intellectual talk without any real substance. Anyway, here is why I thing so:

a. Kenneth's assertion that an open source company "will not last for more than 5 minutes. " is based on the premise that in an open source company, is one where all the code produce ought to be open souced, in which case "neither the employer nor the employee get anything out of the code in terms of IPR." ....but that's the fallacy. Firstly, open source companies like Red Hat, don't make money out of their *IPR* (whatever that is supposed to mean). Secondly, I don't see why every bit of code that a company produced should be open sourced to qualify it as an open source company. Isn't it sufficient to open source every bit of code for every binary bit that the company distributes in the open ? ...I believe Red Hat does this.

b. NDAs do not apply just to code. As an ex-Red Hat employee, i remember signing a contract where some of the terms of agreement did sound like limiting the extent to which i could communicate things that were considered as company confidential, but none of these IIRC had anything to do with source code. Does that make the Red Hat contract a freedom-crushing NDA ? I didn't think so.

c. Does it really matter who owns the copyright of an open souce code base ? really, think about it ...in practical terms, what are you (as an individual) do with copyright ? If something is GPLed, and you disagree with your company, you quit and fork ...you own the copyright of the fork. If copyright needs to be asserted (for example in the court), I'd rather have my company do it for me, that fight it out myself. Isn't that why even the FSF requests copyright assignment ?

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html

...how is that different than a for profit company requesting the same ?

gah ! like I said, this thread is trying too hard to be deeply intellectual, but it isn't.

Hi !

.............More than two decades ago, IBM, had changed the fortune
of a then unknown company-Microsoft, by awarding it a contract to
develop an OS for IBM PC. But this time around IBM plans to bring out
a "Microsoft-free" desktop environment. Working towards this goal IBM
along with Virtual Bridges and Canonical has launched a Linux-based
virtual desktop solution. This desktop solution is designed to help
corporate save a lot of money compared to Microsoft-desktop
software..................

http://www.enterpriser.in/India/Know_It/IBM_Launches_Microsoft-free_Desktops/551-96092-448.html

These solutions existed before but for the first time three FOSS
vendors with mixed business models have teamed up to come up with a
solution to offer a cost effective green solution helping corporates
to get out of the clutches of Microsoft. IBM name lends credibility to
the whole thing !

It will be interesting to see how corporates look at this. It simply
wont matter what kind of hardware you have - single core or dual core
or a portable device , what OS you have  -it could be Linux , windows
or Solaris or whatever !

It is about time !

first define what is a FOSS company - only then start sneering at the way 
others have tried to approach the problem. I freely admit I was wrong about 
the 5 minute thingie. I was under the wrong impression that all Redhat did 
was package code written by others - and am very impressed with the cygnus 
story. Obviously there is a business model where one writes/modifies code for 
someone and insists that it is open sourced. And obviously the company that 
produces the said code would be the first choice to enhance/maintain it. 
Strangely enough I have been following that model - although my business has 
always been part time. So far none of my clients have given a RF about 
whether the code is open sourced or not - all they care about is that it 
works.

it doesnt matter to you - but we high nosed pseudo intellectuals have an

GPL is only a subsection of FOSS licenses - and quoting from the scriptures is

there are some who argue that the GPL is also a license that restricts

OT but one of my friends referred to  this link. I found it amusing to
since it was written by ex-Microsoft guy.....

....Former Microsoft employee Keith Curtis publishes new book "After
the Software Wars" on lulu.com. The key to faster technological
progress is making software free, he writes.

The difference between free, and non-free or proprietary software, is
similar to the divide between science and alchemy. Before science,
there was alchemy, where people guarded their ideas because they
wanted to corner the market on the mechanisms used to convert lead
into gold.

Whoa ! ...i'll back out a bit. I seem to have hit a nerve somewhere. This wasn't a personal attack on you, that's why i said the *thread* was trying too hard.

methinks, some clarifications are in order ...

a. It's a moot point discussing what 'constitutes' an 'FOSS' company, because, like you very rightly point out, the 'F' in FOSS also is debatable. So, one cannot really define a FOSS company.
b. I used the FSF request for copyright assignment only as an example of why ownership of copyright with the company or individual is purely a matter of preference and logic...not one of right vs. wrong
c. In terms of 'insatiable curiosity about totally trivial and irrelevant things', i have no doubt one can discuss something right until godwin's law is invoked ....or more :)

If a organization has the copyright over the entire product, then it 
isn't purely a matter of logic as that particular entity can distribute 
a proprietary variant of the same code that I volunteered to write for 
them under a open license. MySQL, OpenOffice.org, Qt etc follow this 
business model. There are many people, who wouldn't agree to that out of 
the principle of not aiding proprietary interests.

FSF does require you to assign copyright for some of the GNU projects 
but it is bilateral agreement where they promise not to create 
proprietary variants and FSF has a very strong culture of keeping up 
that trust if anything.

This is an illustration. Don't draw analogy. 
It is "a Man" and not Men and " a woman" read as "a (surrogate) woman" 
But open source people also work in organisation(s) under a person(s) with authority. Not always freelance.

You can do this in the virtual cyber world if you like, the illustration was on careers which a person can be put to and the direction one can see for code ownership.

        http://www.stdc.com/. What do you want to know about my
 contract?  The company copyright policy is to opensource the code we
 write; code I do on my time belongs to me, and I am not sure I want to
 share benefits details with the internet.

A large amount of code in any distribution in usually written by third 
party developers and packaged by the distribution which primarily acts a 
integration point more than anything else. Packaging is important 
obviously but to consider Red Hat as just a packager wouldn't reflect 
reality. To understand why, it helps to look at the underlying business 
model and to bust another myth as well. Many people think that support 
and services boils down to just hand holding (ie) teach someone how to 
do "stuff" and then argue that if software is good (which it is), it 
wouldn't require such hand holding. One example of such an argument is

http://linux.slashdot.org/linux/08/12/02/2354248.shtml

However that isn't the only value. The cygnus story provides part of the 
real answer. A lot of the code that goes into upstream projects these 
days (esp the prominent components of the stack which really matter) is 
driven by vendors who do it on behalf of the customers which includes 
new features and bug fixes. As long as customers get what they want, 
they don't really care about the fact that others can get it as well. 
The fact that it is free and open source code, makes no real difference 
from that perspective.

As a result of that, Red Hat is the single largest contributor to Linux, 
Xorg and has developed and continues to maintain a large number of core 
components including glibc, coreutils, GTK, D-Bus, HAL, NetworkManager, 
PulseAudio, Avahi, PackageKit ..  you get the idea. If not, take a look 
at https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/RedHatContributions

Suffice to say that regardless of any Linux distribution (or even other 
unix/unix-like systems for that matter) you are using, you are relying 
on very significant amount of code developed within Fedora by Red Hat 
and others. None of this is of course, charity. It makes pretty good 
business sense and yes it can be done with just free and open source 
code without waiving the standard "Intellectual property" flag.

For example, the following business model[*] could work in some situations.

A hardware vendor contracts a FOSS company to make GNU/Linux "just
work" with their hardare. The FOSS company then makes the patches to
the existing stack available under appropriate FOSS licenses. In some
cases the FOSS company could even work on the Windows stack and give
that code under FOSS licenses. The hardware vendor thus gets a lot of
consumers for the hardware.

One only wishes that more hardware vendors would see it this way. ;)

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

chvt -- CHange foreground Virtual Terminal.

Summary:

In GNU/Linux OS, be default, 6 virtual text mode console terminals
will be running. User can switch between this terminals using Left 
Side Ctrl + Alt + FunKey(1 - 6).

chvt command is also used to switch between this terminals. It can 
be used in shell scripts.

Examples:

$ chvt 1 -- Switch from current terminal to /dev/tty1.

$ chvt 2 -- Switch from current terminal to /dev/tty2.

Read: man chvt

TIP: Screen Dump in Text console.

# sudo cat /dev/vcs2 > scrdump.txt  -- Take the screen dump of 
                                /dev/tty2 in scrdump.txt file.

It is a GE Health Care application at a Hospital.

It first said it works only on IE 6. After Identifying Firefox as IE
to it, it further said MS Script is needed.

I shall give the link to that product after another inquiry. I do not
remember it now. It simply refused to open saying it is not IE or MS
Script is needed.

Wondered how proprietary people lock customers through such solutions
providers. That needs IE which in turn needs Windows.. Obvioulsy an
anti-virus.. Huh!

Long way to go...

Some already do. Intel used to contract Tungsten Graphics 
(http://www.tungstengraphics.com/, which is also the lead developers of 
Gallium3D) instead of doing software in house.  ATI's recent open source 
3D driver was atleast in part written in contract. Hardware companies 
might have not the expertise in-house to write good software on a 
particular area quickly and frequently do reach out to other 
organizations to improve time to market.

This is not limited to just drivers. Nokia contracts Collabora 
(http://www.collabora.co.uk/, developers of Empathy) for some of their 
maemo work. Intel used to do that with OpenedHand (http://o-hand.com/) 
before acquiring them recently.  I could go on but it is quite obvious 
that there is a large amount of commercial activity in and around Free 
software.

BSNL offers 2.4Mbps wireless Internet connection for 500/- Rs its unlimited
but its available only for particular area. I neither have a laptop
nor a proper signal coverage here
so i dont know much about this, search in Google for "bnsl 2Mbps wireless EVDO".

Hi,

Found this following interesting pages.

http://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/EVDO.htm
http://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/EVDO_BTS.htm

Had an enquiry in BSNL shop in anna nagar.
They told that EVDO device is still not available in chennai.
It may be available after January 2009.

Have to ask in BSNL Office.

Will ask on monday and tell the status.

Thanks.

Hi,

>> tatindicom usb is reliable all over India - speeds are about 150.

Thanks.

I went to a Tata indicom shop.
I asked for a demo.
Tried with ubuntu and wvdial.
connected easily.

But the speed is very less.
It remembered those dial-up days.

It was very slow. Even cant get gmail.

I never worked on wireless.
Is it will be like this?

They said that we cant compare with broadband.

How about relience? or any other service provider?

How to check what bandwidth we get in wireless?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0812060910t6534623cr8adefa93936ee4a8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I got this doubt from a reader of my post
at
http://goinggnu.wordpress.com/2007/02/13/convert-avi-to-3gp-using-ffmpeg

He has a problem with the h263 codecs.

Which package is to be installed to get these codecs?

I think ubuntu-restricted-extras.

Am I right?

Thanks.

I'm rather new to Linux and using the Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex system. Now

Hey,
    I agree, the command a day has been amazingly useful for me. In
special regard to the apt-get command, what about source commands? My
ignorance of them was primarily what caused me to shift from Debian
(to ArchLinux):

apt-get build-deps package  - Installs all the build dependcies for package
apt-get source package - fetches the sources for package.

This is not surprising.  I have come acros e-governance sites that 
require Windows/IE to transact with the govt.   On one hand the govt. 
claims it is all for open standards, yet some of the implementation is 
left in the hands of the contractors that design Windows/IE specific

Dear Friends,

We have conducted a 3-Day FOSS Faculty Updation Program at Rajalakshmi Engineering College from 2nd-4th Dec. 2008. Nearly 27 faculties got benefited from the program.

The Team from NRCFOSS led by Dr.S.
Srinivasan(readily accepted invitation & framed contents) and accompanied by Mr. Mohammed
Imran, Mr. Sanjiv K. Saini , Mr. A.S. Prakash, Mr. Senthil Anand and ilugc Member, Mr.
Ravi Jaya were the guest speakers.

http://www.nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/RajalakshmiEnggTtp


Faculties enjoyed sessions on Moodle, MySQL and PHP very much and were satisfied with the team of Speakers. Mr. A.S. Prakash distributed his BioPuppyLinux CD to the Dean of Biotechology, Dr. Parthasarthy and H.O.D Dr.Johanna Rajkumar and briefed 4 faculty of Biotech Dept. separately.

This time nearly 130 students from CSE Dept. have chosen the FOSS Elective-I and I felt the faculty needs to be aware first. This is the result of it.? 

After Exams are over we would be conducting 2nd FOSS workshop for students(Mr. Bhaskar, LinuxExpert was involved with first workshop).

Once again thanks to the NRCFOSS team and ilugc members. In fact a query with regard to FOSS Elective-I by one student in our ilugc member long back prompted me to have a dialogue with Dr.Srinivasan and this program became the result of it.

With regards,
Benedict J.N.
Coordinator,
FOSS Faculty Updation Program,
Rajalakshmi Engineering College

Normally ffmpeg with w32codecs/w64codecs should handle pretty much any 
format under the sun. Did he try that?

I also used it previously. If you are near to tataindicom tower, you
will get at least 15KB to 25KB up/down speed. if you are far away, then
you will be stuck with 2KB. This is what I experienced.

Support for linux is great. No issues on configuring the modem. I used
it in Ubuntu 8.04. But the speed matters for me, so I switched to BSNL
broadband.

Thanks,
Mohan.

Hi!!

Have you written software?

*Yes?*

Everytime a piece of code WORKS, do you feel a tingling sensation in your
veins?

You are not alone!!

Did you want to know how a certain feature works, but could not since its
source code is closed?

*No?
*

Do you like your imagination go awry and render that human touch to code by
ARTWORK?

Do you love interesting themes and specialized interface to provide
'ACCESSIBILITY'?

Or do you want to read the application in your mother tongue?

Close your eyes and open your mind!

*Welcome to the world of open source!!*

Starting this December, you will work alongside developers from all over the
world to provide the feel a software needs, a human touch.

Make it magical!


 Interested?? Read On...

This massive development(includes ARTWORK too!!) is held in a contest format
just to encourage more people to go open!!

   - Develop software, the open way!
   - 'Grow' software on the base application we provide.
   - Tamper, tinker others' code.(Give them due credit!)
   - Submit with an eye on time.(Your TIME is YOUR score)
   - Complain others who do not give credit for your code on which the built
   upon.

Growing on a base includes,

   - *Bugs* - Reporting & Patching
   - *User Interface* - your own doorway
   - *Themes and Language Packs* - For the non-coder.
   - *Code optimization* - For the avid coder.
   - *Features* - Take a look at the problem statement.


Keep visiting www.kurukshetra.org.in<http://www.kurukshetra.org.in/k09/events>for
more details and latest updates.

yes, also the outputs from my system may help you.

mokka@mohan-laptop:~/Downloads$ ffmpeg -formats 2>/dev/null | egrep

 DE h263            raw h263
 DEVSDT h263
 D VSD  h263i
  EV    h263p
  EA    libfaac
 D A    mpeg4aac


Letter 'E' in the below exact lines from the output will tell whether
ffmpeg can encode h263 and aac. If it is not showing 'E', then there is
some problem on mapping libavcodec.

 DEVSDT h263
  EA    libfaac

So here is one sample encoding from .avi to 3gp.

Hi all,
 How would automattic figure in all this?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automattic

Almost all their known projects with quite some part of Akismet is
open-source/free software.

Also how do people figure with companies which make extensions for
Firefox and stuff like that.

Is there any place where I can get all X11 commands and their usage?  I
can get it by `find /bin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin -name '[xX]*'`, But I
need a proper material to learn other than man pages. Is there any
document which will tell how to use these commands? I googled, but fully
messed with all those commands. I need tutorials or guides for X11 with
all its commands.

There is no well-defined collection of "X11 commands".

One option you have is to read the documentation that comes
with X. It is packaged as xspecs on Debian.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0812081427010.1244-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

openvt -- Open a new Virtual Terminal and start a program on it.

Summary:

In GNU/Linux OS, be default, 6 virtual text mode console terminals
will be running. User can switch between this terminals using Left 
Side Ctrl + Alt + FunKey(1 - 6).

openvt will find the first available VT, and run the given command on
it. If no command is specified then the $SHELL is used.

Examples:

$ openvt -- Start a shell on the next free VT. Try Alt+F<1-12> to see 
            new shell session.

$ openvt -v -- Same as above, with extra output.

$ openvt -l bash -- Start the shell as a login shell on next free VT.

$ openvt ls -- Run the 'ls' on the next free VT.

$ openvt -s ls -- Same as above. But Switch to the new VT when 
                  starting the command.

# openvt -c 9 ls -- Run the 'ls' on the 9th VT.

Read: man openvt

HTH :)

In old distros, the X11 commands will be in /usr/X11R6/bin and man
pages in /usr/X11R6/man. But now commands are mixed and placed in
common location like /usr/bin,...

Subject: [Ilugc] Backup options?
Message-ID: <20081208114609.GA15659@current2.gayatri-hitech.com>


Hi,

I come across a variety of backup tools:

	a) bacula
	b) amanda
	c) rsnapshot
	d) rdiff-backup
	e) duplicity
	f) backuppc

and so on.

I can understand rsnapshot and rdiff-backup, to a certain extent
duplicity as well as it seems to be related to rdiff-backup.

However I confess I am quite flustered by the sheer length of
documentation available with bacula and amanda.

If any of you help me out with the experience/knowledge you possess it
will be nice.

I am mostly interested in network backup and solutions based on RAIDed
disks instead of tapes or DVDs.

Yes, I am aware of commercial alternatives like Vembu's StoreGrid.

I certainly prefer open source solutions.

Thank you and have a nice day!

It has been two days, upgraded myself ( means, my laptop) into Intrepid ibex
from Hardy. But, actually i am not feeling too much ok with this Intrepid.
My laptop is vaio. I don`t know why..but.. sometimes the xorg becomes so
busy and makes my machine slower & slower & slowest. Sometimes... the
brightness goes down automatically.... & lcd goes into darkness... at that
time, i need to reboot my laptop.

I don`t know what type of problem is this...but.. i haven`t face such
problems with Hardy before. Can anyone please advice me something?

This is a bit late perhaps but do you know why you upgraded from
Hardy when it was working for you?

I'm not sure about others, but I do a clean wipe-n-install of my 
workstation everytime a new Ubuntu release comes out. I'm always 
pleasantly surprised by one subtle new feature or the other. On Ibex, it 
was really neat looking font rendering this time. (Also, I get to backup 
some overlooked stuff and the apps run faster).

Assuming all X commands start with [Xx]* here I got a commandline to get
most of the X commands.

$ find /bin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin -name '[Xx]*' | xargs -n 1 basename
| xargs man -f | grep -v 'nothing appropriate'

Is there any other location that I need to add?. anyway thanks for the
input. I'll go through the man pages to get something about X11.


Thanks,
Mohan R.

 I am working  in the same field so i may be able to help you, if you put
your question a little more clear.

1 )  Whya re you looking at traditional backup tols like amanda? do you have
any tape backups in mind?

2) how large  are your backups ?

3) what is the purpose of your backup? restoration? DR? offsite?

4) Time frame of your backups?

5) backup methodology? incremental? differential? or a point in time copy?

I have used amanda quite extensively, and now regularly use backula. 
However, there is zero desire on my part to quote their docs to you.

Why dont you go ahead and provide some details on what you are looking 
to backup, what the storage system is going to be like and the various 
use scenarios. that would make recommendations and comments from 
everyone else a lot easier and relevant to your situation.

Same here, I have also moved on from Hardy to Intrepid -- clean install and
its working perfect for me. On may desktop as well as laptop. Upgrade may
have some issues, so I would suggest a clean install.

Since a number of people have suggested this, let me say that I
consider broken upgrades (from public release to next public release)
to be a bug. If all of you are truly finding such bugs then it is
your duty (;>) as FOSS enthusiasts to document and file these
bugs.[*]

Each release should clearly document the upgrade path and if
necessary, point out caveats and workarounds.

Re-installing (and re-booting) should be relagated to the same place as
"that other operating system".

Regards,

Kapil.

[*] The steps should be roughly as follows.
 0. Backup your current system.
 1. Restore pre-upgrade machine from backup.
 2. Open a pencil-and-paper notebook to write down what you do
    and what happens.
 3. Perform upgrade as explained in the release notes.
 4. Find out all the things that are broken.
 5. Go to the bts/launchpad/whatever and file an installation-report
    documenting all the breakage.
 6. Restore your current system.

Since it is a 'Company' it would include some of the stuff that is
standard fare. As regards the 'FOSS' part of it, it generally includes
clauses that mandate the release of components under appropriate FOSS
licenses.

Diverging a bit from the thread, 'FOSS Business Model' is probably an
overloaded term. Interpretation range from discussions around doing
business with FOSS tools and services to doing business in a
collaborative fashion with artifacts of the business in the open (as
much as legally possible).

Running a business with FOSS does not make one a FOSS company
automagically. There are umpteen examples of such PSUs and private
enterprises in India who would not fit into a 'FOSS Company' tag.

Besides the socio-political bits (and hence the economic
interpretations) intrinsic to FOSS, a 'FOSS model' does base itself upon
 concepts like collaboration, adherence to open standards, communication
and so forth. Looking at FOSS companies primarily from the point of view
of employee agreements or NDA may be limiting the scope of comprehending
the actual model.

On a side note, take an example of a FOSS company developing a set of
tools and services for a deployment which has been tagged by the
appropriate authorities as 'secret' and hence nothing can be shared or,
re-used. Would that make such a deployment or, the developer or, the
consumer non FOSS ?

'clean' post is one form of top post - it is even worse than a top post. The 
way to post is to trim the original post leaving only the matter you are

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

deallocvt -- Deallocate Unused Virtual Consoles.

Summary:

The command deallocvt deallocates kernel memory and data structures 
for all *UNUSED* virtual consoles.

When you do 'openvt', a new virtual console will be created on the
next free terminal. After using that, We can deallocate it using the
'deallocvt' command.

Examples:

# openvt -s ls -- Run the 'ls' on next free VT (mostly on tty7).

# deallocvt -- Deallocate unused VT. Now switch to tty7, you won't 
               see any change on the screen.

# deallocvt 7 -- Deallocate /dev/tty7, if it is unused.

Read: man deallocvt

HTH :)

Absolutely great, I'm attending conference from my home. OGG is really
great. I never think my bandwidth is enough to play live streams. This
time, No pinch hits, no hip hops.

Thanks for the link. I really enjoyed the quality of OGG.

I am not looking for recommendations. That would not be the right thing
to do IMHO.

It is my onus to figure that out for myself. Most likely I will settle
for the ones based on librsync like duplicity.

I only wanted to know what your experiences were. I deliberately left
the question vague to promote discussion for the archives and for the
benefit of others looking to learn.

I was told that amanda can be used even when no tapes are involved. I

And don't plan to use that right now.

Now that you ask I should say that I want to backup every single file on
a daily basis for years. Also databases...

There are many servers on the network where these files live.

I want incremental backups, so I can go back in time.

I don't know what is meant by a differential backup.

Is that based on diff(1)?

Anyway I may not be able to respond as I am going out of town for a
while.

Have fun!

Subject: [Ilugc] Unable to mount folders exported by NFS Server
Message-ID: <200812092251.22960.pankaj@glug4muz.org>

Hi,
 I am having three linux system in my LAN with details as follows:

1. Open SUSE 10.2 with Static IP Address 192.168.0.2 and treating as Server.
2. Fedora Core 6 with Static IP Address 192.168.0.3 and treating as Client1.
3. Zenwalk Linux 5.2 with Static IP Address 192.168.0.4 and treating as 
Client2.

Now I want to export one fixed folder to Client1 and another fixed folder to 
Client2 from Server
so that I can work on Server from Client Systems using the concept of NFS. For 
this purpose I made
following entry in the /etc/exports file:

=======================================================================
# See the exports(5) manpage for a description of the syntax of this file.
# This file contains a list of all directories that are to be exported to
# other computers via NFS (Network File System).
# This file used by rpc.nfsd and rpc.mountd. See their manpages for details
# on how make changes in this file effective.
/home/rashid    192.168.0.4(rw)
/home/ccpplinux/public_html    192.168.0.3(rw)
=======================================================================

Then I started nfs server on the Server system with the following command:

=======================================================================
linux-server:/etc # /etc/rc.d/nfsserver restart
Shutting down kernel based NFS server                                 done
Starting kernel based NFS serverexportfs: /etc/exports [1]: Neither 
'subtree_check' or 'no_subtree_check' specified for export 
"192.168.0.4:/home/rashid".
  Assuming default behaviour ('subtree_check').
  NOTE: this default will change with nfs-utils version 1.1.0
exportfs: /etc/exports [2]: Neither 'subtree_check' or 'no_subtree_check' 
specified for export "192.168.0.3:/home/ccpplinux/public_html".
  Assuming default behaviour ('subtree_check').
  NOTE: this default will change with nfs-utils version 1.1.0
                                                                      done
linux-server:/etc #
=======================================================================

Then from the Client2 system I tried to mount the folder exported from the 
Server as follows:

=======================================================================
root[~]# mount 192.168.0.2:/home/rashid/ /root/server/
mount.nfs: internal error
root[~]#
=======================================================================

But as you can see I am getting the message of internal error.

Similarly from the Client1 system I tried to mount the folder exported from 
the Server:

=======================================================================
[root@FedoraClient ~]# mount -t nfs 192.168.0.2:/home/ccpplinux/ /root/server/
mount: 192.168.0.2:/home/ccpplinux/ failed, reason given by server: Permission 
denied
[root@FedoraClient ~]#
=======================================================================

As you can see I am getting message of Permission denied.

So I am unable to make use of NFS in my LAN. Can you please help me so that I 
can start using the
facility of NFS on my Linux Systems?

I will remain thankful to you all for this forever.

You are missing the "public_html" in the path.  Try:
    mount -t nfs 192.168.0.2:/home/ccpplinux/public_html /root/server/

Run the exportfs(8) command on the nfs server and see if all file systems
are correctly exported by the server.  Check syslog and /var/log/messages
on both client and server for clues on what is breaking.

If you are using iptables on any of your machines, you will need to configure
it to permit nfs traffic.

 Thanks for reply. Tomorrow I will try with public_html in path. But what may 
be the problem in case of Client2 system?

In addition to this I would like to tell you that I am not using iptables but 
using Squid proxy server on my Server System to share Internet Connection on 
Client Systems.

Just making sure the exports is ok is generally not enough. Some
daemons need to be started as well.

Unless you specify port numbers on the command line while starting
the nfs related daemons you need to run portmap on all machines.
You need to ensure that portmap access is enabled for 192.168.0.x
in /etc/hosts.allow

Ensure that you are running rpc.mountd and rpc.nfsd on the server
machine and that you can see this on the client by running
 rpcinfo -p 192.168.0.2
on the client machines. 

Ensure that you are running rpc,statd and rpc.lockd on the client
machines and that you can see this on the server by running
 rpcinfo -p 192.168.0.3

On Debian systems and derivatives all of the above are done by
/etc/init.d/nfs* scripts.

    first start portmap service
    then start nfs service
   then check whether u r file has exported through NFS or not using this is
   #showmount localhost
                           This is my idea..... try it and if u find good
one also send it to me.....

Just wondering, isn't it easier to attract people if you could explain a 
little more about the project in the mail itself, since you took the 
trouble to write it in the first place? Accelerometer in which device 
would be a start (the development platforms differ based on the device, 
right?).

Also, having a working prototype or at least some code in a repo would 
be much more convincing. How do you know it will take exactly 3 months? 
Isn't easier to break it down into "achievable goals in 3 months" or 
some such? That would help people in deciding whether to get more 
details about "your" open source project.

I don't know about KG, but I would be slightly miffed if somebody

Message-ID: <3232b7ed0812100818x15489247h60c9f2a436fff0e9@mail.gmail.com>

The EEE department of MSEC, Kodambakkam, Chennai have a sympo
coming up in Feb. Say the first or second week. There is an idea of
distributing GNU/Linux Live CDs to the participants. They expect around
500 participants.

Now, is it possible to obtain such a bulk order. I noticed that we can get
bulk delivery of CDs for conferences or organized events in
http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/shipit-faq

There are two major options

1) Get the official media through shipit or likewise
2) Have a PC with all major Linux ISOs and write as per the user's req.

The second idea has a lot of shortfalls since the CD writer will not be
able to cope up with 100 cds at the least. Also the cost of media will be
high.

The wish to distribute Ubuntu 8.10 or Mint. Ubuntu will give them a taste
of free software butI felt people who just pop it into their drives may feel

vexed if  they can't play mp3s. At least for the starters you know. People
think it is the weakness of an OS not to play mp3s out of the box.

There also emerges a third option.
Now, is it possible to write the ISOs locally somewhere. I mean, if we get
a bunch of really dirt cheap disks(say 100 discs at Rs.200 which is kinda
more affordable) and if somebody can write the disks for us...

These CDs may not "look" professional. But of course who will not try some
free stuff?

Also, we will try to get a stall for the LUG. (This has not yet been
discussed
with the department staff). If we manage, we can have the disks in the stall
itself and run a small demo. This however _may_or_may_not_ be possible.

I am not in the EEE department myself. I am doing this on request of my
friends in that dept.

hi,

i don't have the whole mail thread with me, but i'll try to give you a
simple solution for you.. :-)

In NFS server, put the following line (replace "your_directory" with your
actual directory)

# vim /etc/exports

/your_directory  *(rw,sync)

then export the shares, restart the portmap and nfs server.

for the time being issue the permission as world read and writeable (chmod
-R 777) to that directory.

inside that directory you create two more directories.
# mkdir /your_directory/sub1 (like wise)

Install the nfs-common libraries (pdgs) in the client machines.

change the following files (in clients).

# /etc/hosts.allow
   portmap : your_server_ip

# /etc/hosts.deny
   portmat : ALL

this should be the IP address, not the hostname.

log out and log in (if you really need)...

try to mount the share manually.

#  mount your_nfs_server_ip:/your_directory_sub1   /your_client_mont_point

if you can view the mounted share by cd /your_client_mount_point you've done
fine.

if you want to auto mount the particular share every time the computer
boots, put that mount point in /etc/fstab.

# vim /etc/fstab
server_ip:/your_directory_sub1    /your_client_mount_point  nfs rw,hard,intr
0 0

do the same with the other client.

i'm sending this mail on the run.. update the list if you encounter any
hicups.. ;-)

good luck!

dd is fine.

Yo can use "shred" also.

I think you should probably blank /dev/sdb rather than /dev/sdb1.

Also if the person who buys your disk wants to analyse it
magnetically and has the equipment to do so :) then this is not
enough.

In that case you need to run something like "shred".

I can see how data can be "recovered" if one just deletes the files from 
the filesystem and not obliterate the contents from the disk platters.

What would the equipment find, if I have written each and every byte on 
the disk with zeros?

According to the info page for shred: 
  If you have sensitive data, you may want to be sure that recovery is
  not possible by actually overwriting the file with non-sensitive data.

  However, even after doing that, it is possible to take the disk
  back to a laboratory and use a lot of sensitive (and expensive)
  equipment to look for the faint "echoes" of the original data
  underneath the overwritten data.  If the data has only been
  overwritten once, it's not even that hard.

  ...

  [Shred] uses many overwrite passes, with the data patterns chosen to
  maximize the damage they do to the old data.  While this will work on
  floppies, the patterns are designed for best effect on hard drives.
  For more details, see the source code and Peter Gutmann's paper
  `Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory'
  (http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html), from
  the proceedings of the Sixth USENIX Security Symposium (San Jose,
  California, July 22-25, 1996).

Of course, this does not take care of "bad blocks" that were found by
the "smart disk controller" and duplicated. The original data in
those "bad blocks" is not directly accessible via the disk driver and so
it will not be over-written. So, depending on your needs (;>) you may
want to think about what you will do about that as well.

Yes, similar.
We are going to use 3 axis accelerometer for this project.
This project already done in Gsoc; But developed as a module using AVR MC
for Windows OS. Now we are going to implement it in embedded Linux and
migrate it for one of a embedded linux project.

dear prakash:
you could create a wiki page in nrcfosshelpline (if you haven't done
already) giving more details -- info on specs, brief explanation for some of
the terms, etc.

the link could be given in this mail list. in fact, others who are more
knowledgable could add their bit.

Hi Ashish,
Do you have a custom compiled kernel? If so then, it is not necessary to 
download headers. If not, you have to download the headers and write a 
makefile. The makefile is very simple.

obj-m += <yourfile.o>

all:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean


Then
make modulename

There is no specific directory to place your source, just compeile it 
and later you can insert.

Thanks,
Santosh

Is it your project or an NRCFOSS project? It's a good idea to abstract out the goals and targets of the project. It will help attract talent and students will be able to figure out if the proposal is suitable for them.

After our first bad experience with free as in bear, We do not give
CDs free of cost. If the management or Organisers are ready to bear
the material cost (+ their own contribution for our activities, if
they wish) involved, We can make arrangements.

We do have our LoCo produced CDs that we take it to events in & around
TamilNadu.

What do you mean by NRCFOSS project.
Any one can upload their project ideas in nrcfosshelpline.in and start their
collaborative project. Yes, this is my project. We are providing real time
projects for students to some exposure on open source and Linux. Myself,
concentrating on embedded systems.

I agree. I will update the the page
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/embedded
with the necessary info.

Hi,

I dont know why this is not working for me. I was able to compile the hello
world module without errors.

I got the below error:

make -C "/lib/modules/2.6.25.14/build" M=/root modules
make[1]: Entering directory '/usr/src/linux-2.6.25.14'
scripts/Makefile.build:217: target '/root/pcnet32.c' doesn't match the
target pattern
Building modules, stage 2.
MODPOST 0 modules
make[1]: leaving directory  '/usr/src/linux-2.6.25.14'
I got the pcnet32.c file from
/usr/src/linux-2.6.25.14/drivers/net/pcnet32.c. 2.6.25.14 is a compiled
kernel.

Why is it that pcnet32.c did not get compiled when the kernel was compiled?
or when the modules were compiled?

Regards,
Ashish

I din't have the look at the latest menuconfig of the kernel. But, 
generally the module gets compiledf only when you select the appropriate 
option. All the modules won't be compiled by default.

Another problem I can assume is that, pcnet32 must have been written 
only to be built internally into the kernel and not as a module.

Any other thoughts?

I had a wrong idea, the actual error is with the makefile. Somewhere 
regexps are used, which could not match the specified pattern. Thats the 
problem.

Hi Santosh,

The problem was in the make file. I had put pcnet32.c instead of .o. The
module has now been compiled. Now I got 4 files

pcnet32.ko - I placed in /lib/modules/2.6.25.14/kernel/drivers/net

What should I do with the rest. What are these for? I found similar file
types in the /usr/src/linux-2.6.25.14/(different folders)

pcnet32.mod.c
pcnet32.mod.o
pcnet32.o

Regards
Ashish

Hi ashish ,


they are the object files which were linked into the kernel module
file(.ko), you need not worry about them , they should actually be
gone if you run 'make clean' ........

also for more info refer to LDD 3rd edition (Linux Device Drivers) ,
it is all explained there , .. .you should be able to find free
versions of the book in PDF format on the web , ..........


Thanks
Satish

         In Ubuntu, you have Firefox web browser. That is better than
Internet Explorer in many ways. But if you still want to have an IE in
linux, you can install ies4linux (http://www.tatanka.com.br/). But I
don't recommend that.

Dear experts,
                       I am using Mandriva 2009 and Ubuntu 8.10 in my PC. I
created single vfat partition to use files between both OS.

I added the partition in /etc/fstab as below

/dev/sda4     /mnt/share     vfat     users, grp=users,umask=0002,rw,utf=8
     0    0

But Ubuntu 8.10 automounts the partions as readonly. If i create or copy
some files to this parttion asks current user password to perform the task
with waning message.

What is the problem?

please guide me.

Padhu,
Ooty.

Good that you pointed it out !

Please read the fine print .....

"Note that to install any MS program included on IEs4Linux, you need a
valid Windows license. IEs4Linux will not ask for it and you can run
everything without any problem even if you don't have a license. But
it is illegal and a I have nothing to do with this."

So may be  try using a virtualisation package like virtualbox or
vmware and a licenced version of XP or win95 or anything or ms crap.
And use that browser.

But again why in the world .....

cheers

What is private money then :-)

people deposit their money with banks.. banks lend loan for most
businesses.. and aren't they also public money..  that makes a private
organization equally responsible to public as a government
organization.. isn't it? ;-)

You need to check 3 things
1) Does your user belong to group 'users'?
2) What happens if you manually mount that partition with the command
mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/share
3) Try running fsck on the partition and then remount it.
If all the above fail, you should try on the ubuntu lists/irc
channel/forums/lauchpad.

even if you have a valid windows license, it is still illegal. Look at the 
download page for IE - specifically states that it is only legal to run it on 
specified platforms - and linux is not one of the specified platforms. So DO 
NOT DO THIS.

Not mandatory. Few examples here::

* There is a open source mobile project called OpenMoko. NRCFOSS bought this
hardware and make it available for collaborative development. NRCFOSS
already announced that, "We  sponsored OpenMoko project",
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/web/full/49/NW/
I dont have any idea about, who is contributing for open moko from NRCFOSS.
But still it is available for contributors and enthusiast thr NRCFOSS.

* Myself and some other enthusiast people developed a minimal Linux for
bioinformatics called BioPuppy Linux,
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/BioPuppy
It is still available in NRCFOSS Helpline site and have its own site,
http://biopuppy.org. I spend my official time for Biopuppy work. As a owner
of this project, I did not get any official info like, NRCFOSS supports
Biopuppy linux. But NRCFOSS highly encourage and supports biopuppy Linux
activities. DIT-India also encourages BioPuppy works through NRCFOSS.

The term "NRCFOSS supported project" is crucial term.
Finally, I would like to make it for all thr open source. No matter, who
sponsor a open source project.

Will it be useful if we create one on freenode or such?
It will be very useful to the newbies who may have several doubts and 
issues regarding using Linux, but how far is it useful for the rest of 
us, I am not able to guess.

Just struck me lately.

there is a perfectly good chat room at ##linux-india on freenode with a lot of 
ilugc members on it - that can be used. Waste of effort to start a new one.

Well, there exists one #ilugchennai in irc.freenode.net server which was 
created somewhere around 2004. But it is barely used and hence been 
lying there abandoned. So far, ##linux-india had been one place we all 
have been interacting, though a few other LUGs do have their own 
channels (excluding ilugd, ilugb and glugbom).

afaik, one channel is sufficient for India. I have been working hard to 
promote ##linux-india as an all India channel and am proud to say that it is 
*the* place for the Indian FOSS community to meet. So go ahead and use it.

One nation is not one channel - one language :-)

Also, get on to #thamizha or #ubuntu-tam, We can chat just as we share
things when we meet in person :-)

Instead, installing IE and using the same page is like using a pain killer
to comfort pain from a fracture and ignore the fracture itself. Also as
chrome is clearly on the rise for Windows users. So more and more are
going to be harassed by a poorly written page.

Lastly IE is the worst performing browser in acid3 test

I am intrigued as to why the LUG meet is on Saturdays. I have college on
all Saturdays and so find it impossible to come to the LUG meets.
(I mean it. EVERY saturday. We even have a regular 7 hour timetable for
that day!)

Unless there is a specific reason, can I take the privelege of requesting
that LUG meets could be held conducted on Sundays?

Like The Bangles sing it, "Sunday is my Fun Day"!

I understand that the choice of day would have been made after some
amount of deliberation. But please weigh this request.

Yes please.. I study in college too (apparently the same one).. So it

Lol. That's actually very good advice. Even better. Drop out of college. 
Start/contribute to an open source project. You'll get better job offers 
than your degree will ever get you ;-). I wish somebody told me this 
when _I_ was in college :).

We shared events that happened around in the last one month.. and
Raman shared few useful commands.. later it was on FossConf 2009..

need for physical volunteers was stressed upon..

apart from having usual talks etc., need to bring people from
different streams of life.. auditors.. lawyers.. doctors..
academicians.. linguists etc., to know their expectation from FOSS
world to make free software for them, explore ways to do that.. can be
one thing where this fossconf can distinguish itself from the previous
one..

any college/ institution/ organisation willing to host is welcome to
do that on the first confirmation basis..

in law college I attended a total of about 30 classes in three years - but now 
a days the younger generation is of no use - all they care about is 
attendance and credits.

Hi ,

The Hod of Kamban Engg College Mr.Jyothish Kumar,had expressed his

I do agree to his suggestion of keeping ILUGC Meet on Sunday. 

>KG suggestion -- To bunk classes 

I did bunk lots of classes during college days but the Institution was govt.. college. Situation is not the same in Self financing colleges.

Todays self financing colleges are run like schools. Keep students occupied all 7 hours.? No choice to bunk any period in between as some of us used to do. 

As a faculty in a self financing college, I do feel for really interested students in FOSS who are not able to attend due to classes on saturdays. Even I am not to able to attend ILUGC meet on Saturdays for the same reason.

Few months back we had Virtualization Workshop at IMSC, Taramani. I was able to attend since it was sunday and got benefited.

My Suggestion:?? We can alternate the ILUGC meet on Sundays and Saturdays to satisfy all the members from -Industry, Faculty and Students.

With regards,
Benedict J.N.

just tell me which college you are in - as long as it is under Anna 
University, I will arrange special permission for you to attend the 
meetings - this goes for all students/faculty

I am in Meenakshi Sundararajan Engineering College. Well, getting
permissions to attend the meeting is one thing. I will still be missing
classes and tests (Well... In fact I like being in college when the coll
works. I am well above average in studies, but still I would dislike missing
classes.)

I most certainly can "bunk" or get permission to attend the
meet once a month. But again at my college, we are offered a max
of 3 to 4 days off every semester. If I bunk for the sake of this meet,
I would miss out on a chance to bunk during critical times like my
upcoming GATE in Feb

This seems to be an indirect and rather "hacky" solution to the
problem. If there is no problem in shifting the day, I wonder why it
should not be.

I agree that "bunk classes to attend LUG meetings" is not really a
solution.

Hey,

there is nothing like it has to happen only at IIT and on Second
Saturdays. If possible host another meet may be on third Sunday at
your own College.

Your College is near Railway Station and has a Bus stop at a Better
reach place when compared to current IIT's TeNet Hall in my opinion..

Previous attempts were made at MIT also, and I am not sure for what
reason it got discontinued..

Can you people come forward organize a monthly meet up at Meenakshi College?

Remember you have take up the responsibility of what Bharathi does,
Call for speakers, make an arrangement and most important thing, it
has to be done continuously..

Message-ID: <809586140812140808q2838d16epf3357fc2fd086a89@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Luggies,

I am doing a research study on the awareness/usage of Open Source Software
and Enterprise 2.0 (Software as Service, Cloud Computing) in Small Medium
Enterprises as a part of my MBA, Technology Management at Anna University.

My study is around the usage of OSS by SaaS providers which in turn will
yield a lower TCO for the SME's. The usage of OSS stacks like LAMP etc. by
the SaaS provider will bring better benefits to the SME.

Open Source SaaS will become a future business model for the next generation
IT vendor. This what I am trying to provide in my hypothesis.

As a part of my study, I request all the luggies to help me in filling out
my Online questionnaire  located @
http://www.heysurvey.com/survey/show/id/11169/open-source-software-and-enterprise-20-in-small-medium-enterprise.html

I request all to vote for OSS  which provides benefits to both  SaaS
providers and SMEs.


PS. The study does not deal about data privacy  which is against  OSS
fundamentals.

I don't want to miss being with children on Sunday.

If student community feels so strong about ILUGC meet, let us restart
vidyashram sessions and have them on Sundays.

But from our past experience, I am not very hopeful about student
support for more than a week or two.

is it under Anna University? Do you have a LUG? Do you want to have a LUG? Do 
you want FOSS activity in your campus? Please meet your HOD and ask him/her 
for permission for NRC-FOSS to hold a one-day FOSS awareness workshop in the 
college.

Why can't we broadcast ILUGC meeting?

I think we can do broadcast through GISS.tv(or similar kind) so that
anyone who is online will attend the meeting.

Just a taught.. I don't know the exact implementation. fsfs.in did it
recently, may be we can get inputs from them.

+1. IIRC, the same questions were raised time and again in the past, 
even once by me when I was in the college. Well, considering a majority 
of usual attendees of LUG meets are people who are working, they would 
like to spend their Sundays with their family and for attending a LUG 
meet they have to spend their entire Sunday afternoon + evening out. 
Hence LUG meets are conducted on Saturday afternoon, hoping that people 
would at least be able to get a half-saturday once in a month.

For students communities there are few alternative solutions to this,
[1] Convince your college and get the Saturdays when LUG meets are there 
as half working days.
[2] Convince your college and organize LUG meets in your college, 
provided all similar facilities and freedom available in our current 
venue is made available.
[3] Start your own LUG in your college and have LUG meets on Sunday. May 
be few from ilugc can also participate in your meets.

IMHO, IITM has been the most favorable and least problematic venue that 
has been working for us for a long time and nothing matches the campus, 
making every visit an experience and few hours of freedom from the 
hustle and bustle outside :)

this is the most stupid survey I have seen - I tried to answer it and all the 
answers were rejected. If you do not have the intelligence to code your own 
questionaire, I suggest you do your research in microsuck windoze.

sorry for that, it was my mistake to expect comments  and that was the
reason it should have rejected.

Conducting meetings on saturdays in our college (be it any saturday of
the month) is out of the question.. Its because the college works 8.30
to 16.30 on saturdays (all of them).. We can try and get permission
for a Sunday meet though.. Again, getting permission depends on who
you're approaching.. Staff in my department (EEE) don't know Linux has
GUI.. Whats even worse is that there are many teachers in IT and CSE
departments hate Linux (for some reason).. Ashok has even told me
about a teacher explaining to his class "Why Windows is the world's
best OS" during an OS lab session..

Subject: [Ilugc] Resolution problem with Arch Linux and Xfce
Message-ID: <e6b5008a0812141905x39a3e4dnd4147721cbfda53d@mail.gmail.com>

I installed Arch Linux on my system couple of days back.
I downloaded and installed xorg
Then i installed Fluxbox first as i wanted a really lightweight
Desktop Environment..

The command startfluxbox was of no use.. the screen would flicker and
then the mouse would stay at the centre of a black screen and wouldn't
move..
even editing .xinitrc didnt help..
my .xinitrc file looked like this

                 #!/bin/sh
                 exec startfluxbox

After a lot of speculation, i went for Xfce.. As i had used it before
(in Xubuntu), i thought i'd feel comfortable..
Dint work.. so i edited the second line of the .xinitrc file.. then
gave 'startxfce4' at the prompt..
It worked!!

But the resolution was darn low.. 640x480 i guess..
I've edited the "Screen" section in my xorg.conf numerous times after
that.. deleted all Mode entries except "1024x768" (the resolution i
want) but ecerytime i login, i get only a 640x480 screen.. Xfce
overrides the xorg.conf file specs..

The CLI where i give the startxfce4 command (which happens to be vc/1
or vc/2 et. al.) has a good resolution though!
I tried deleting (at the insistance of a guy from IRC channel
#archlinux), ~/.config/xfce4/mcs_settings/display.xml
Didn't work either..
The worst part is, if i set DefaultDepth as 24 in my xorg.conf, the
system says that the monitor doesn't support 24 bit colors..
I have been running all other OSs in my PC with the monitor set to 24bits only!!

Any help will be really appreciated.. Thanks..

Could you please tell me what video adapter you have? I guess setting
the right one in xorg.conf might solve your problems. Also, I suspect
even "vesa" should work, though I am not sure if that is what you
want. lspci |grep -i [g]raphics might give the exact details.

The driver I use is "intel", on X.Org 7.3. This is the replacement for
i810 on earlier X.Orgs. If you have an Intel based graphics adapter,
this might work.

I have an Intel based Graphics Adapter. I have generated and tried
xorg.conf.vesa using hwd.
Not working either.
'X -configure' generated the xorg.conf file for me.. and i'm sure for
an intel based graphics adapter, X -configure should work pretty fine.
I suspect my monitor is under-reporting the resolution the Xfce.
I'm running ubuntu now and will shift to Fedora soon..

I guess you mean data lock in!!! Privacy itself is of supreme concern in OSS.

As for the survey itself I felt it was pretty superficial. Sorry.

Data privacy is actually encouraged. RMS actually called the SaaS model flawed (though I don't fully agree) as we are giving control of our data to 3rd party service providers and hence implies that we do not have full control (including privacy). One of the reasons for FOSS is to prevent backdoors and hence boost privacy.
FOSS is against proprietary software and not against data privacy. Simple and obvious examples are personal data, medical history, financial data etc.

I think you should post this question to IWUG-C. This is a LUG.

This is not related to Linux in any way. It's not related to Open
Source either. Also, you have not done your home work by searching on
<your favourite search engine in here>. You will get lots of links
explaining the cause and how to get around it.
Since, this is on a LUG already, I will suggest an open source
solution in form of DOSBox[1].

err, this is a FOSS/Linux list; how is your question related to either 
FOSS/Linux?

I am sure there are many MS Windows mailing list/forums that can help 
you out.

This must imply that the chaps you post such questions do not follow any 
of the discussions that goes on here and realize that it is *not* a

Gosh! this is really really sad.. I thought teachers in the states
were better informed than their colleagues o'er here.. This is
stupidity.. The teacher has probably never tried  googling
"open-source" or "software freedom" or even "free software".. I'll
surely go to an extent where i'll say she doesn't know what google is
at all!!

Is it not possible conduct the meets after 16.30 hours?  At most you

Happens everywhere.. Microsoft has brain-washed users so much!! Linux,
though next in popularity only to windows (unfortunately) is less
known than a Mac OS is!!

And people who use Linux are written off as geeks/nerds (as is the
case with me and my friends. Only i use Linux.. The others are
confortable with a virus.. :P )..

We can try and surely ask for an after 16.30 meet in college.. As
someone pointed out, our college is quite accessible by both road and
rails..

Exactly. They need to know what linux and software freedom is! They

Actually the problem is much more serious. It is not trivial by any
standards. FOSS is not a fad or fashion just "cool".

Please read the help that has been posted. Kumar asked you to provide
the output of lspci. That will help people on the list who want to
help you.

I would be surprised if a recent Linux distribution like Ubuntu Ibex
or Fedora 10 does not manage to fix your X window server
"automagically", however it has been known to happen. :-(

College want all students to get passed, pack them for Campus
interview, surrender them to Proprietary giants, and get rated into
Top 10 in A C Nielson - Sun TV survey or Outlook Survey ;-)

And it is understandable that Teachers have to assist it..

I have come to your college, approached you Prici for a FOSS event, a
year back, (gave them even two Ubuntu CDs), and that was a memorable
visit, in the sense that the ears were shut for FOSS.

That doesn't need to be the case anymore, with you people around..

Atleast three of you are here, join hands knock the doors together..

I'm not running Arch anymore. So i guess i can't do a lscpi..  I've
shifted back to Ubuntu and I'm planning on Fedora 10.

The problem is not with Ubuntu or Fedora. But with Arch..

lscpi output on Ubuntu:

82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE Chipset Integrated Graphics Device (rev 01)

I guess it doesn't matter whether i run Ubuntu or Arch. The output

Xorg autoconfiguration is not usually dependent on the distribution 
(unless they decided to patch stuff and not send it upstream which is a 
bad thing to do).

If your distribution has a recent version of Xorg (including the latest 
X Server), it should detect and use the right settings on the fly. 
Though some of the old hardware doesn't work yet (requires manual fall 
backs or custom settings), this does work well on all Intel cards afaik.

Check your X log in /var/log/Xorg.log* and output of lspci and file a 
bug report against your distribution's bug tracking system with the 
details.

I couldn't agree more.. Colleges have turned into full time
'finishing' schools for IT companies.. But we'll have to see what
happens in the wake of the economic slowdown..

Hi,

I am unable to bring my laptop out of sleep after I reopen the lid. I have
to restart the system after I close and open the lid. I tried the steps in
the below URL, but it did not help.

If however, the laptop sleeps due to long inactivity, I can bring it back by

Hi,
Just a piece of brotherly advice from a fellow 'stuck-in-yet-another-private-
engineering-college' student. This list is archived and ensure that your 
friends/foes (and myself) don't black mail you threatening to show this email 
to whoever *she* refers to and stay out of trouble. 

As for LUG meets, ask your parents to send a note to the college exempting you 
from classes on second saturdays. If it doesn't get approved by the HOD. Go to 
the Principal. If still not approved bunk the classes, give proxies, get an On 
Duty. Extremely stupid and ridiculous excuses, especially works wonders :D. 
(From Dilbert of course ;) )

Indeed. This Intel chipset should be supported by the xorg intel
driver. So the xorg configurator should be able to generate a config
file. Please generate such a file and post it so we can see what went
wrong.

Check your configuration.  It may be set to "hibernate" and 
not "suspend" when you close the lid.  I guess by "restart" you mean 
power on.  If so, does it restore the desktop to the state a priori to 
closing the lid?  If this works then hibernate works for your lappy.

This tells us that "suspend" is also working on your lappy.  See above 
comment.

Blackmail ?

You did not read rest of the story about the US teacher and what
happened to her !
One FOSS company in Newzealand offered $10000 for revelaing the name
of the teacher.
There were about few million slashdot hits on the news item.

And finally the teacher is supposed to have called  and seems to have
wept " why did you throw me to the wolves like this " and apologized
for her ignorance.

The school board apparently is a big promoter of FOSS in a big way !

Isn't there a lesson in it? What a "User" expect is some one who sits
and explains the way he has to use the software or a proper answer.

not answers like google yourself first.. its there you take it..

and proprietary people do not do that..

This is a very old article and the support for ACPI has improved
quite a bit since then. This does not mean that "suspend to ram" is a
"solved problem". :-(

There are many solutions but most of them depend on accurate
information about the ACPI support for the specific laptop so
it really depends quite a bit on the specific make that you have.

Please check a more recent source of information for suspend-to-ram
and suspend-to-disk under fedora 9.

Regards,

Kapil.

Really?  MS charges $25-35 per incident for help (desktop OS) over the 
phone.  More complex stuff - they refer you to their solutions partner 
in your neighborhood.

Yes, and i810 (or intel) should have worked with Arch Linux. The next
step would have been to try to start X on Arch Linux, and hunt for
errors (lines having EE in them) in /var/log/Xorg.0.log, and see why X

No, they don't do that...

What usually happens with proprietary software is that they put out a
lot of marketing material and a manual that nobody reads, the damn
thing doesn't perform to expectations,there's a helpless help line,
and people end up asking their neighbourhood geek anyway. The only
difference is the price placebo - after paying so much (or
alternatively, pirating it and feeling satisfied about *not* paying so
much), you feel that it's so much better than something that's free...

Of course, there are exceptions to that rule (some of Apple's
software, for example - damn easy to understand, if nothing else), but
I find that to be the most common scenario.

Wow!  It is not so in the Mumbai area.  I have interviewed several 
MCA/B. Tech/B. E. types.  What they know - even on the proprietary 
platform is little.  Majority need at least 6 months of training before 
they can start contributing an iota to the company.  Large MNCs perhaps 
can afford it.

We always site mailing list as a place where one can seek help. When
one seek help it has to properly answered, whether it is paid or
volunteered.

If a volunteered effort isn't going to be as good as paid one, then
there is no wonder people considering it 'not for them'..

I am not referring to Students or Computer Science Professionals.

An end user.. We say we help you on mailing lists, When they come
here, I believe We should not say, Google before you ask here.

The easiest and best option would be to point your mouse to the Sleep
button wherever it is instead of just closing the lid. Try setting a
keybinding for sleep. something like Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S so that you
don't press it by accident..

if you are newbie in using borland, I would suggest Dev C++
http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html .
It works in Windoze.

/me points out that it must be exec xfce4-session in .xinitrc and not
startxfce4.

But the resolution was darn low.. 640x480 i guess..

If you initiate xfce4 through xinit (or startx for that matter), the
resolution
will be taken from the default xorg.conf. Else xfce will figure out its own
resolution. (Like you did in your case using startxfce4)


> The CLI where i give the startxfce4 command (which happens to be vc/1

Hmmm. That is dependent on the way grub's menu.lst is configured

I strongly believe that India is _the_nation_. I am not planning to do
my PG in any other land. We have everything that one needs, and
just lack takers. I am tugging along as many as I can to provide
India with really inspired and dedicated PG students at the IITs and
IIScs.

I also feel F/OSS is the way to go for a nation like India where there is
no shortage brain and hr, but there is a dearth for liquid cash. (F/OSS
makes sense even when you do have cash :P).


Err.. Sorry for getting way OT. I couldnt resist the urge :P

Hmmm.. Am not too optimistic about this.

Good idea. But I have to say IITM is one of the best places to be. The wild

May be few from ilugc can also participate in your meets.

We still won't have people like Kapil ji, Raman and Bharathi. We will just
be a bunch of enthusiastic students who keep coming in in cycles. We
will keep reinventing the wheel. Also ILUGC is well established. So you
will get better speakers. I remember a Portuguese speaker came once to
deliver a talk on err... some Skype equivalent if I am not wrong. At every
announcement of speeches, I curse my misfortune for not being able to
be there.

@Venkatraman.S:
My college does not offer a PG. And I missed IIT once (my JEE. I really
flopped in it. I am not missing it once more).

Also IITs are going to be cheaper to study in compared to self financing
deemed univs for the PGs and they have a solid reputation too.

Not to start of an Anti Indian Higher education here. But there is a
lot more one can learn going out (if you can afford) like for e.g. How
people in other countries think and solve an issue, How different is
the education outside India, other cultures. I was like you. But
believe me it is a lot different experience outside. You learn a lot
more other than the general academia which is very very helpful. It
also helps in building global networks. With all these rich experience
and knowledge if one come backs to India and start implementing them
imagine how much effect it would have. I agree being patriotic. It is
more predominant when you return and start sharing your knowledge you
gained with the majority who can not get this experience due to
various reasons (mainly financial). Thats where I guess, one can show
gratitude to Home country.

Have fun!

There is no wheel we invented. We just keep rolling the wheel we know 
and have been rolling for years. We very much welcome others to roll 
similar wheels to nook and corner that we can't or aren't able to reach.

So you expect "some" people from ilugc to keep speaking all the time. 
Why dont you try speaking at some point in your life or someone from 
your "bunch of enthusiast who keep coming on cycles" speak? Do you think 
it is not possible for them to give better talks? Break the ice at some 
point of your life, dude.

Well then request someone in this mailing list who attended that talk to 
deliver it again for you guys. Am pretty sure somebody will come forward 
to do it.

With so many forums, some specializing for newbies  with step by step 
howtos, a google search usually comes up with some solution; more often 
than not, this has been my experience.  In most lists, members are 
willing to help those who have tried to help themselves but when 
someone asks for "step by step" guide or repeats a query (without 
showing any effort on his/her part) that has already been discussed and 
solved, then it is not surprising to see "have you at least made an 
attempt to search for the answer?"  

I have also noticed that when end users are asked to give more details 
of their problems (with suggested tools) they just drop out of the 
scene.

It is not possible to make everyone happy.  If some people feel it 
is "not for them," so be it.  Everybody does *not* have to switch.

Being a member of several LUG lists, I will say that the quality of help 
from FOSS/Linux mailings lists/forums is equal or better than the paid 
support especially when users have done some home work and then sought 
help.

IMO, mailing lists and even web forums are not the place for the end 
users to seek help, unless they are tech savvy due to their own 
initiatives.

Typical end users on the prop. platform go to the guy who installed the 
OS and the apps _or_ they ask one of their computer buddies to fix the 
problem for them.  Businesses, including small ones, typically buy an 
AMC to service their IT issues.  This has been my experience, I don't 
see them going to Windows forums to seek help.

Precisely, people should be willing to pay for spoon feeding service - 
there is no such thing as a free lunch.

To this end, I would suggest that there be a list of individuals who can 
spare time for hand holding (for a small fee).  A percentage of the fee 
can go to fund the various FOSS software projects and LUG activities.  
At the end of the day all parties should feel they are getting 
something out of it.

Well.. I just say at this point of time, in my experience, proprietary
people understand a "User" better than FOSS people...

That dragged me to that previous statement..

What "Users" (again not Students & Computer Science Professionals)
want is Software that works on installation, do things that they
expect and not pointers how to make it work..

I hope I change my opinion asap :-)

Well, the proprietary people build support cost in their products 
(assuming you have licensed copies) otherwise expect *no* support e.g. 
unlicensed XP do not get any security updates from MS.  Compare this to 
Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu ... there is *no* charge for updates.

Heck, for paying clients I also hold their hands to the extent of 
placing in house tech. support in their offices/factories.  Whereas, 
when people send me private emails seeking help I simply tell them to 
post their queries at the LUG mailing list or pay consulting fee if 
they want personalized hand holding.

The proprietary people work on the same principle - no money no support.

From software useability point of view, we have had minimal issues 
migrating people from MS Office to OpenOffice once we have trained them 
on how to use the equivalent features in OOo (see above comment).  I am 
not a graphics designer but I suspect for someone who is familiar with 
Photoshop it should not be too much retraining to use GIMP, likewise 
for other domain applications ...

On another angle, take Vista which requires you to invest in a whole lot 
of other software that are no longer compatible with it e.g. I can no 
longer use my lic. copy of WordPerfect Suite 2000.

If you are referring to clicking on setup.exe and answering a few 
questions to get the software going then I agree that it is a mind set 
change that is required to do it the "Linux" way (package manager) but 
this is also the bane wherein a lot of the problems creep in through 
end user tinkering with their systems w/o fully understanding what the 
heck they are doing.  I had one end user tell me their 5 Win XP Home 
stations were networked with out any TCP/IP settings!  Upon closer 
inspection I showed them that all their systems were getting IPs from 
the broadband router's dhcp service.

It is not that none of us move out of house on Sundays. We do and many times for FOSS activity. I am only against shifting regular monthly meet - which at any cost I attend.

However, you can go ahead and organise sessions in your college, many of luggies will attend or talk. 

Please go ahead and try to organise some activity in your college however small it may be. Look at what is happening in MIT. There are regular scheduled classes on Linux every semester - of,by and for students. They have it every Tuesday Evening.

I always thought it's "users" of proprietary software who puts 
themselves into the shoes of the s/w maker instead of the s/w makes 
making the shoe as per the user wants. On the other hand, most FOSS 
softwares are written by people who were/are users of their own software 
or at least they make the initial version of it for their own foot size 
and as more people started trying to put their foot in, it got improved.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

bg -- Place a job in BackGround

Summary:

Normally user can run a job in background, by adding & at end of the 
command (ex: sleep 10 &). 

bg is a shell command. It is used to move a job from foreground to the
background, as if it had been started with `&'. If JOB is not present,
the shell's notion of the current job is used.

Examples:

$ sleep 100 -- Start a dummy job in foreground.
  Press Ctrl+z to stop the current job.

$ bg -- Move the last stopped job to background.

$ sleep 150 -- Dummy job 1
  Press Ctrl+z to stop the current job.

$ sleep 140 -- Dummy job 2
  Press Ctrl+z to stop the current job.

$ sleep 130 -- Dummy job 3
  Press Ctrl+z to stop the current job.

$ jobs -- List all active jobs.

$ bg 2 -- Move the 2nd active job to background.

Read: help bg, jobs

Use "dtach" or "detachtty". For more general use learn to use screen.

By the way, normally backgrounded jobs are not expected to require
input/output to/from the terminal else they will stop.

	Yellow Pages for FOSS & Linux firms
Message-ID: <200812161452.41993.lfyedit2@efyindia.com>

Hey all!

Posting some information that's being sent out LFY's advt/sales department. 
You may find it handy....

Best,
Atanu

---------------------------------------

Here's an opportunity for FOSS consultants and firms to get FREE publicity 
through LINUX For You!
 
Our interaction with IT managers has revealed that one of the biggest 
obstacles faced by them while reviewing FOSS solutions is lack of information 
about potential solution providers. It seems that if they had multiple 
options, they would feel more comfortable in discussing their challenges with 
different solution providers, and thus having the confidence that they were 
taking an informed decision.
 
To bridge this gap, LINUX For You has been working on creating a Yellow Pages 
section within the magazine itself, where anyone seeking a Linux/FOSS solution 
provider can find them through a category-wise listing. In the last 2-3 
months, we have managed to collate a list of over 50 solution providers. But, 
we believe that there are many more out there, and the real value of FOSS 
Yellow Pages (FYP) will only emerge once decision makers have ample choice to 
work with.
 
THUS, THE SPECIAL OFFER: Any firm**, be it a one-man consultancy or an MNC, 
can get listed for FREE under any ONE category of their choice. This offer is 
open till 31st December 2008 or till we reach our goal of listing 100 firms in 
FYP. This free listing will be applicable till March 2009, and could be 
extended if things work out well. Oh! The Yellow Pages listing will also be 
made available online, shortly.
 
To enlist your organisation for FREE, you can download the form from 
http://www.openitis.com/fyp/ [Please ignore the tariff mentioned in the FYP 
leaflet -- those are applicable to only those who want to enlist under 
additional categories.] If you have doubts or queries, please feel free to 
call Dhiraj Khare at 011-26810601 or 02 or 03 (extn: 230) -- he will be more 
than happy to facilitate your entry.
 
Hope to keep playing a role in growing the India FOSS ecosystem with your 
support...
 
Yours truly,
LINUX For You Sales & Marketing Team


**To ensure that firms listed in FYP are genuine, we will seek one of the 
following: 
(a) proof of incorporation of the firm, or 
(b) proof of a current account for the firm

Well.. I wanted to to this for a non-interactive program (transmissioncli).
I am downloading a huge dvd ISO and it will take days on my 256k
connection. Being sleepy I did not do a startx and just used the vt/1
In the morning, when I wanted to log into X and still have transmission
reporting, I found I coudn't.
Of course, there is transmissiond for this very reason. But this might
not have been an isolated case. (Say mplayer is another app that might
require attaching and detaching to different terminals).
Screen is of course "The solution". But I want a lil' more X friendly way to

do it.

Message-ID: <6295eb0e0812160605s6f6c4fb3uc0f8756bdd23ca13@mail.gmail.com>

Due to a security bug found in the PHP 5.2.7 release, it has been removed
from distribution. The bug affects configurations where magic_quotes_gpc is
enabled, because it remains off even when set to on. In the meantime, use
PHP 5.2.6 until PHP 5.2.8 is later released.

PHP 5.2.8  released!!!

The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate availability
of PHP 5.2.8. This release addresses a regression introduced by 5.2.7
inregard to the magic_quotes functionality, that was broken by an incorrect
fix to the filter extension. All users who have upgraded to 5.2.7 are
encouraged to upgrade to this release, alternatively you can apply a
work-around for the bug by changing "filter.default_flags=0" in php.ini.

Message-ID: <4986ffac0812160610h7f77585dh5cf2299b8bdce436@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've mounted a samba share (smbfs), and tried to backup my files, to it.
I tried 3 methods, using file-roller GUI(creating tar on mounted
drive), normal 'cp -R' method, and rsync. All of them failed in
between, because some (2) files are very large in size, 2.9GB, and
4.3GB.
What could possibly be the mistake? It usually gives some message
like, "Large File Size", or something, rsync just fails, with some
error.

Will creating an iso, with 'dd' help/work?

Also, I want to include all hidden files, so, should I need to turn
'shopt dotglob' on?

Thanks,
Venkatesh Nandakumar

It is NTFS, with max file size much greater than that (Theoretically
in order of terabytes)

Google gave me this.

Looks like SMB does not mount with LargeFileSupport (LFS) by default.
Mounting with 'lfs' option might help
<snip>
So either :
mount -t smbfs //server/share /mountpoint -o lfs other-options or
mount -t cifs //server/share /mountpoint -o options
</snip>

I think was discussed just a couple of weeks ago. You are looking for
"conspy" or "linuxvnc". Both of these can display what is currently
displaying on a text-mode console.

Yes . It is not open source in true sense . But if you buy the
commercial license then you can see the source code. I dont know how
you classify this . It is a client / server and so you can deploy in
term server mode also.

It is a replacement for Intuit " quickbooks" .I do not know how
relevant it is to Indian market but  I am interested in knowing .


The other one I know is kalculate  > http://kalculate.com/

You get only 2 of the four freedoms. But for a end user, those are
the two that are actually worth having (especially if it is in a specialist
area)

Tally, Photoshop/ Pagemaker are going to be the biggest hurdles here.
Publishers have expressed direct concerns that they can't do without
Photoshop/ Pagemaker and Wherever we conducted Ubuntu Release event
Tally was the key application people insisted whether or not an
alternative/ replacement is there..

Luckily both appeared working with Wine in Ubuntu 8.10 and there was
good amount of joy in the faces of users. But even if it works we need
a replacement asap. Few people have even expressed their willingness
to help in creating a replacement.

Hi !

Like using wine another practical option is the route taken by some of
the medium sized enterprises here in North America. It is possible to
run Xp machine in a virtualised environment like kvm. That way out of
say 20 linux machines one or two will run Xp Vms and should suffice
for small business. It is not 100% replacement but even 95% is a
progress in replacing windows !

Another option is using a hosted version so that only a browser is required.

Of course nothing like a replacement. Quasar works well but is it like
quickbooks tailored for North American market. If any of you want to
work on it and "indianise" it and making it suitable for Indian
market, I am willing to help out. Kalculate is made for Indian market
but I dont know what are the issues. I know Sudhir of Kalculate and
marking a copy of this thread to him so that he can respond.

What about OpenERP[1]? It has a accounting only profile[2], that one
can use for accounting only needs. There's also a project on launchpad
for Indian localisation of accounting known as  accounts_india[3].
There's also Indian Chart of Accounts[4], though it was released quite
a while ago.

Hello friends,
    I'm Sanath Kumar and I take this opportunity to introduce you K++ which
is the  Open Source Software Development Event at Kurukshetra '09.
Kurukshetra is the annual techo-management festival of College Of
Engineering, Guindy. The event, in short, is a simulation of product
development in the open source kingdom. In brief, this event gives you a
problem statement and a base code. You have to develop the base code and
submit your work incremently. As in the open source world, you are not
expected to develop the whole software by yourself. You can develop modules
of any size and integrate it with the base code and submit to us. We'll
evaluate your submission and reward you. There are also a handfull of bugs
in the base code, which you can report to us. Bug Reports and Bug Patches
also carry points. At the end of the day its about colloborative development
of software in a competitive manner. Its going to be a lot of fun especially
with the unique time based points which we deliver you. Moreover, its fully
ONLINE. This event is designed for everybody from novice to expert. So
there's food for everyone's appetite. Excited..? So what are you waiting
for..Go to kplusplus.kurukshetra.org.in and start working right away.
Anybody and everybody can participate in this event. Its after all
"*OPEN".*Very attractive prizes are there for the winners.

People, also take a look at www.kurukshetra.org.in for a host of other
events.

This is personally my first step towards promoting FOSS. Your participation
show to the people of other colleges and also to my own college that FOSS is
not a *Philosophy* but a *Phenomenon.*

FOSS Freak,
   SANATH KUMAR

tinyerp is a perfect replacement - is in use in quite a few establishments in 
India - one of the leading CA firms in Mumbai uses it extensively. However, 
Tally has features that make it very easy to cook up accounts to evade taxes 
which is why it is so popular - tinyerp cannot do this.

I know - the word 'want' implies a desire to install IE - there is no desire 
here, only a compulsion.

AFAIK, There is no direct interface to do this in Shell. But I think,
We can do this by writing specific program, which detach from TTY
(like daemons). And it can attach to the TTY from which it receive the
signal/cmd (like screen).

Strange !

In order to check for browser compatibility it can be done with IE on
windows .Why should you install IE on Linux and check the browser
compatibility of a site ?

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

fg -- Place a job in the ForeGround.

Summary:

Normally user can run many jobs in background, by adding & at end of
the command (ex: sleep 10 &).

fg is a shell command. It is used to move a job from background to the
foreground, as if it is NOT started with `&'. If JOB is not present,
then current/last job is used.

Examples:

$ sleep 100 & -- Start a dummy job in background.

$ fg -- Move the last job to foreground.

$ sleep 150 & -- Dummy job 1

$ sleep 140 & -- Dummy job 2

$ sleep 130 & -- Dummy job 3

$ jobs -- List all active jobs.

$ fg 2 -- Move the 2nd active job to foreground.

Read: help fg, jobs

How many firms are *really* using tinyerp/openerp in India? 
Claims of extensive deployment/usage should be validated (e.g. on 
openerp web site or the consultant's web site).

On a side note, I have not had much success getting openerp to work on 
Ubuntu 8.04 and Centos 5.2.  I have followed the instructions for 
installing from the source (ensuring required libs etc.).

The "server" python script bombs with error messages (plan to follow up 
on them on the openerp mailing list).

I have been able to get TinyERP to install and work on Fedora 9/10.
And OpenERP 5.0 RC1 on Windows. Will be trying out at home, on
OpenSUSE this week.

Well !

I got the impression that checking browser compatibility was the
issue. I thought it is better to check with IE on windows so as to
rule out any other problem arising out of " IE on Linux"
implementation -  leaving alone other issues like legalities etc.

Looks like IE has got its own share of problems without our help !

contact Sawata Banerji - or Mehul Ved. Also I see a fair number of Indians 
asking queries on the openerp mailing lists.

Message-ID: <b423b9550812162357i782f15acm89e8097123ef206@mail.gmail.com>

Hello ilugc,

I am selvam doing final year computer science in Jaya Engineering college

I am happy to share that we students started working on "Centralized Tamil
Spell checker for GNU/LINUX" under the guidance of Mr.Amachu and Mr.Kumaran
HOD CSE dept of our college.

so what i have done so far ?
-------------------------------------------

1.Extracted 14,000 Tamil words from Aspell-ta
2.Doing research on Aspell, Kspell, hunspell etc
3.I am writing a Tamil spell checker engine module in python which can be
integrated text editors and browsers
4.I have written a plug-in for gedit with Py-GTK toolkit for GUI which makes
use of our tamil spell checker engine module which is under development

Here the snapshot of the work done so far,
--------------------------------------------------------------------
http://img242.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshot1lw2mh9.png
http://img242.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshottv2pu2.png

Currently i am using Google doc to organize the Tamil word list, but its
very slow as i am using mobile GPRS Internet connection.

what i expect from you ?
-----------------------------------------

1.Feasible/Better solution to collect and organize the Tamil words which
should be accessible to everyone.
2. Help to add/edit the tamil words to word list.
3.If you are guy/girl with similar thought who want to contribute something
of this sort,do join with us.
4.Help on tamil Grammar rules and suggestions to implement them.
5.Also if you have tamil word list please send it to me.

 FYI

This is to inform that a *serious security flaw *in the* Internet Explorer
(IE)*, has been reported by BBC.

Refer to the link below for more details

<http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/em/fr/-/2/hi/technology/7784908.stm >

http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200812160952DOWJONESDJONLINE000402_FORTUNE5.htm

Security experts urge users of Microsoft's Internet Explorer to switch to
another browser until the security flaw is fixed.

Ashish

where is the code? If it is a FOSS project, the code should be available on

looking good, but the whole dialog is in english - should it not be in Tamil? 
One reason why you should have your code in a repository is that you can also 
have a ticketing system so that we can post suggestions/bugs there. That is 
how FOSS works.

          There is no user named 'users' and only group is available.

           Manual mount of partition is working. But it require root
permission. Normal user couldn't write in this partition.

>Just asking. But if both are GNU/Linux distributions, why do you use vfat?

           Nothing special in using vfat. No windows OS in my PC. Even
though my pendrive in ext2 file system, i just made it as vfat.

> 3) Try running fsck on the partition and then remount it.
If all the above fail, you should try on the ubuntu lists/irc
channel/forums/lauchpad.

I add 'noauto' in fstab as below and change my idea from auto-mounting

/dev/sda4     /mnt/share     vfat     users,
grp=users,noauto,umask=0002,rw,utf=8    0    0

Then I create an alias in ~/.bashrc file of normal user

alias share="mount -v  /dev/sda4"
alias unshare="umount -v /dev/sda4"

Now it is working and partition has an RW permission

I have no idea about repository or managing the code on Internet,

I will be thankful if you help me to do it.

how does aspell organise the word list? Why do you need to use google docs? 
Why do you not do it on your own machine? If you have the list under version 
control, you can work offline and commit online - in which case your 
connection speed is irrelevant.

Can you check with the default Spell Checker Dialog in Gedit and note 
how the UI looks. Much better example with be the one in Kate if it does 
have one. The spell checker UI in the above screen shot is a very bad 
example of UI design. I very well understand that it's just a prototype 
but thought of pointing you in the right direction.

The word alternatives are listed as radio buttons with the buttons 
aligned straight to them, which visually implies that each button has 
something to do with the option it is lined with, but it is not exactly 
true in your case.

Also, the common way of offering options in spell checkers is through a 
single-selectable list box and the buttons aligned in a 2 row or 3 row 
two column arrangement. You can see this in the default spell checker 
used in Gedit.

there are 55,000 tamil words available in tamil wordnet which is available on 
nrcfoss website. The words are in roman characters, but I have written a 
python script to convert them to unicode - the database is released under CC, 
so you may utilise that.

Yes to certain level. If we allow the discussion about proprietary
softwares running on Linux, then we should allow the discussion about
softwares runs with WINE also. Hope you understand ;)

aspell-ta uses plain text with single word in a line, as of now there are
only 14,000 tamil words.

Many commonly used words are not there eg  ?????,
we need help to collect, organize and index  Tamil  words for that we are
using google doc now

In fedora docs I found a tool, where people edit documents together..

not sure what.. yes I got it..

Its Gobby :-)

Any one using Gobby here?

http://dailypackage.fedorabook.com/index.php?/archives/107-Productive-Monday-Gobby-Collaborative-editor.html

Can this be used for this purpose..

We are planning to have a standard dictionary.. volunteers each one
can take care of one letter..

In few months time we can arrive at 1,00,000 words

There is already some work by Srinivasan in Ruby for splittings words,
which can come handy later..

Well, to record the fact that Gobby has been used as a standard for 
collaborative textual content development in Ubuntu community for long, 
especially by the Indian team.

`apt-get install gobby` FTW!. ;-)

thank you for your valuable suggestion,i actually tried with gtk Treeview
and Liststore to display list of item  ,but its truly hard to use and
finding the selected item(as i am new).

Now i am trying with kiwi-python module's ObjectList.

suggestions are welcome.

Yes. To use it effectively over the net, you need sobby as well which is 
a dedicated server for editing documents.

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicate/GobbyHowTo

Maybe NCRFOSS can run a instance of that. You need to setup a mechanism 
for authentication as well.  However, there is no effective revision 
control or locking and you can lose data accidentally or otherwise, very 
easily unless it is a small group.

Maybe you can just use a wiki instead.

I am sorry that happened. Actually I dont know how that happened. I just
replied to the last mail in my inbox like I always do. Anyways I don't
expect it to happen again.

Subject: [Ilugc] is FOSS methodology structured ?
Message-ID: <483749.79986.qm@web53605.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hello FOSSians,
Fundamentally is FOSS development methodolgy analytically structured ?
As we see, almost any FOSS s/w development activity is caried out in an adhoc manner and most of the decisions are made out of human instincts. 
More particularly the following points need clarification 
1) Is any FOSS software development activity carried out conforming to Software Engineering Standards ?
2) As in any SDLC workflow (carried out in formal Software Engineering practices), 
??????? a) is there any well-defined documentation available at each stage of project progress, so that 
??????????? those documentation would serve for future reference & revisiting at any future point of time.
??????? b) by the term "documentation" i mean the documents of SRS, Design Specification, Project Plan, Cost-??????????????????? Estimation, Execution Plan, Contingency Plan and so like.
??????? c) so the point is, when such things get documented, the process by itself would render a blue-print before
??????????? hand the solution is implemented and for this same reason only any formal Engineering level work 
??????????? is?carried out in that way.

??????????? So now, the Q'n is does FOSS adhere to formal Engineering practices ?
??????????? If not then for what other one or more reasons we should embrace FOSS ?
??????????? Iam raising this Q'n as a responsible Engineer.
??????????? Also I can tell that if FOSS donot adhere to any formal Engineering practices, then Iam sure that most of 
??????????? the?activities done would yield themselves redundant and that would spell?an eddy-current in the dynamics ??? ??? ??? of economics. How can such?a?scenario be usefull for a layman user/consumer in every-day life ?

Let us try to (re)engineer the entire problem.

Thanks,
Selvakumar.

Hello kenneth thank you for your concern,

 I am part of this project. we were searching nrcfoss website to get the
list but i couldnt get it.
(server takes too long to respond) will be thankful, if you give the exact
link or db-dump

Here is the answer from "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" by Eric Steven Raymond


I anatomize a successful open-source project, fetchmail, that was run
as a deliberate test of the surprising theories about software
engineering suggested by the history of Linux.

I discuss these theories in terms of two fundamentally different
development styles, the ``cathedral'' model of most of the commercial
world versus the ``bazaar'' model of the Linux world. I show that
these models derive from opposing assumptions about the nature of the
software-debugging task.

I then make a sustained argument from the Linux experience for the
proposition that ``Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow'',
suggest productive analogies with other self-correcting systems of
selfish agents, and conclude with some exploration of the implications
of this insight for the future of software.

http://opensource.mit.edu/online_papers.php?lim=1000 would be having
some papers that would be of help. The perception of 'ad-hoc' manner
and "development driven by gut instinct" points to a need to read up a
bit on the papers :)

Case Study: The Hungarian notation
It is considered good etiquette by Microsoft programmers(They claim it
eliminatesbugs caused by typing). But the Linux coding standard takes a
completely different approach to this:

[quote]

Encoding the type of a function into the name (so-called Hungarian
notation) is brain damaged - the compiler knows the types anyway and can
check those, and it only confuses the programmer.  No wonder MicroSoft
makes buggy programs.

[/quote]
Also consider the confused plight of duck type language programmers who
use your API.

http://lxr.linux.no/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle
(It most certainly confuses me. F is Flag and not Float for example!)
Also, if the functions are actually well-written, they wouldn't exceed a
single screen. So I can figure out the type anyway.

            If not then for what other one or more reasons we should embrace

Cathedral and the Bazaar explains this better. (ESR prefers calling
himself a scruffy hacker :P. I love his anecdote as to how he handled
Craig Mundie)

            Also I can tell that if FOSS donot adhere to any formal

I see excellent roadmaps in FOSS projects. And much unlike Microsoft's
Vista's roadmap, which was expected to release in 2003 and came out in 2006,
most are almost on track.
Also the longest step in any SE process(maintenance) is best applied to FOSS
since if the lead dev quits, we have either a fork or a set of developers
taking up
the same project.(audacious from xmms)
Testing is comprehensive too.(Alphas, betas, RCs). This is too slightly
different
from the Cathedral style since we have nothing to hide from the people here.
So
we can involve them more in testing. Testers are always welcome at any
project.
The bug fixes/triage of most software is good.

There are two more [OT] reasons why we do not need to "spend 10 months in
planning and 2 days in execution"
1) The UNIX philosophy: KISS(Keep it Simple, Stupid). Every app does one
thing
and does it well. So we focus on the target alone
2) The development starts with a small subset and keeps adding more and more
(something like the spiral). Since most tools dont charge for updates, this
is
welcomed by the users.

Audacity.

If you want to do a little more features as well, I would suggest ardour

Both are free in all senses

Hi,

The above proposition can be correct, but why then enough eyeballs gather at the bug-fixing stage. Instead if they gather right from the solution inception & design stage probably the bug-fixing stage might not at all exist !!!

because developing software is not like manufacturing a car. You cannot make a 
car with only a vague idea of what the finished product is going to be - and 
if you plan to write software *knowing* what the finished product is going to 
be, you are only fit to work for microsoft.

I work at it. I trim all unwanted stuff. Then move the cursor under the stuff 
I am replying to and type my reply there. I realise that moving a mouse 
cursor takes a considerable amount of effort - but I consider the energy well 
spent as it shows respect for my readers.

Hi,

I wish the roadmaps that you see are much unlike that of BOSS (given & questionably excellently supported by CDAC) too.

All the above scenarios are just plain depiction without adequate parametric quantification, as such scenarios usually happen in both FOSS projects and non-FOSS projects as they are intrinsic in any development process. 
Any system is said to have good maintenability if its maintenance requirement is nearly-zero ie, maintenance-free (or atleast to the practicaly minimum possible extent). So, FOSS obviously doesn't qualify to have a good maintenability (as wherever we turn our heads we hear about bug-fixing in FOSS). 

Thanks,
Selvakumar.

Hmm..

FOSS is all about maitainers.. No owners.. But We have thousands of
mainteners maintaining each and every software that comes with a
Standard distribution..

Its not a easy job.. The amount effort that goes into it.. to make
maintaining an art by itself.. what do think rpm and deb are all
about?

Hi,


FOSS is not about the processes of creating software.

It is about distributing it,sharing the code and giving rights to users.

And those who dont know anything about SDLC also can contribute to FOSS
development.

We dont want to restrict the developers from solving their own problems.

As FOSS software grow, bugs are fixed and become stable soon.

There is no deadline here for hiding all the bugs and sell it to customer.
Then fix the bugs as service packs.

There is no CMM here. But the bazaar model has achieved more than the
CMM outputs.

Which way you are accessing your mail? through web? then check for
settings to reply below. If you are using thunderbird, then click,

Edit -> Account Settings -> Composition & Addressing

and check "Automatically quote the original message when replying"
option. Then, select "start my reply below the quote". This is the
default setting in thunderbird.

     I get some doubts here regarding privacy. In GNU/Linux or any
other UNIX, the default file permissions are 755, which means that
anybody who logs into that system can read/execute any of our files.
This means that there is no data privacy by default, unless we change
the umask ? Or am I wrong ?

    I feel that OSS's concern is more about data ownership than about
data privacy.

This is a really nice tool but if you wish to do nCurses programming
that is hassle free I recommend that you use the perl module for that
from here.

http://search.cpan.org/~mdxi/Curses-UI-0.9605/lib/Curses/UI.pm

I used that recently when I had to do such stuff.

There are also Perl interfaces to the Dialog program itself.

I for some reason picked up the UI module. There are several examples in
the distribution that give some amazing samples.

If you look at them you are sure to like it.

Thanks.

 Hello Everyone...I belong to Jerusalem College of Engineering and today I
had a talk with our HOD about organizing the conference in our college. She
was interested and wanted to know more like.. How many rooms will be
needed?... What the college gets out of it..? How many are expected in the
days of the conference..? etc..She said  only with all these details she can
take the matter to the principal for his permission... Since I am also a
newbie here I could'nt answer those very well..So if LUG is still undecided
about the venue and if they are ok with my college then kindly reply, I ll
PM you her contact no so that one of the mods here can explain things to her
firsthand...

Apparently looks like dialog is built over curses. Both these
programs has its own variants in perl and python (not sure of 
other language support)

Python variants are available in the below location.

Nice to see a college coming forward to organise fossconf.

> needed?...

That depends on the size and scope of the event planned . Previous year
there was one main auditorium with 7 lecture halls and one arena where demo
stalls are kept.
http://registration.fossconf.in/web/displayschedule/  for more details.

What the college gets out of it..?

Though question ... students will get  lot of knowledge and experience.
College will become famous , being the host of a FOSS event in south india.

> How many are expected in the

Again it depends on how it is going to be planned this year.  I am not sure
about  last year statistics . Probably 1000 students participated as far as
I can guess.

yes they need the information and lug will provide youu soon :)

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

ldd -- Print shared Library DepenDencies.

Summary:

Most of the programs/libraries are linked to shared libraries, like
libc, etc. If a particular shared library, needed by a program, is 
not present in the system, then that program will not run.

ldd command is used to print the shared libraries required by each
program or shared library specified on the command line.

Examples:

$ ldd /bin/ls -- Print all shared libs needed for the ls command.

$ ldd -v /bin/ls -- Same as above + Extra version details.

$ ldd /lib/libtermcap.so.2 -- Print all shared libs needed for this
                              library.

Read: man ldd

This is a good trick.

$ ldd `which bash`

so you don't need the complete path.

Use backticks and not apostrophe. ;)

very strange - at times there are dns problems with vsnl dns servers, but that

dns?

for dns server on any installation put:

this will use opendns which is more reliable than the crappy dns servers of

and no where on the packet will there be 'linux compatible' written. 
Tataindicom promises linux compatibility and they will also listen to 
complaints if it is not working on linux - their billing and complaint site 
is also fully linux compatible. It is better to get less speed with linux 
friendly hosts than more speed (in this case no speed) with non linux 
friendly hosts.

Above translates to about 90Kbps-135Kbps.  Please note diff between 
B(ytes) and b(its).

Message-ID: <e6b5008a0812190316n7395faddi1c5fcdc52166e86c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I downloaded the disk image of Fedora 10 KDE live CD about a few days ago.
When i started the installer, I gave the "verify and boot" option.
The CD passed verification.
There was a progress bar with three colours (dark blue, light blue and
white).. That seemed new.. Fedora 9 did not have such a thing..
After that, a splash screen loaded. "Fedora" at the centre and the
image of a sphere with lots of designs in the BG..
The installer hung up forever..

I tried giving 'text' in the boot options hoping to get a text based
install done.. But in vain.
I have an Intel D845GVSR motherboard, 768 megs of RAM but no video card.
I was told to disable EXA acceleration. But I'm not sure how to do that.
Any help will be really appreciated. I'm desperate;y trying to move
out of Ubuntu which has more than bored me. :)

Hello friends,

I belongs to SASTRA University, Kumbakonam.
 The students and staffs in my college are interested in FossConf 2009.


Feedback : In 2008 , there are too many sections are conducted
simultaneously.  In this time, please avoid it...

Friends.

I exchanged the ADM-100c reliance card with ZTE MG 880 card.

This is working fine.

http://avinashjoshi.co.in/articles/technical/usb-modem-on-ubuntu-zte-mg-880-reliance/

Followed the above guide.

wvdial rocked.

Tested with ubuntu 8.04.

ADM-100c card should get driver in linux.

The speed is from 90 to 100 kbps from speedtest.net in open ground.

But inside room, no hope.  :-(

Have you tried using 'sudo'?

sudo vi wvdial.config

And when it asks for password, enter the same password that you use to
login.

I tried openerp, and its UI is very good..  it needs some level of training
for using it..

But the value of the software can be ascertanined only based on how
successfully it is developed..

Openerp uses postgresql..  UI based on GTK library....

dont know how tinyERP can suit this..

I think, if we could project the business usability of open source tools
such as tinyERP, openerp, ERP5 (exclusively for apparels industry), and
openbravo, opentaps etc, we can popularise FLOSS tools very easily..

Currently, i am using gnuCash for maintaining my personal accounts..  but
the reporting seems to be not user friendly..  but for maintaining personal
accounts, its a very good tool..

Senthil

I have created Dom0 and it runs successfully. Using virt-manager, I tried to create DomU but having problems in specifying the Install Media URL for? centos linux distribution.? Other distribution URL also i tried but in vain.

Is it possible to install through DVD? If so, kindly mail the steps in creation of DomU's.

Thanks

Was it a user named 'admin' which you have created? If that is the case,
use    ---  sudo vi   /etc/wvdial.conf

Dear Benedict,

                           Since you have reached a stage of selecting
the installation media, you are booting the xen kernel. 
Xen para-virtualization does not allow installation from DVD. You ay
have to setup a package repository using yum.

                          If you are ok to compromise with a fraction of
performance, you can try qemu and kqemu set of packages. They
will allow you to install with DVD.

Manu.

I also tried to create a tata file in init.d, as mentioned in
http://www.indiangnu.org/2008/tata-indicom-usb-modem-epi-valley-on-ubuntu-linux/.
but then got the below error.

service tata start
stop: missing job name
Try `stop --help' for more information.
/etc/init.d/tata: line 36: status}": command not found

I do not run the NetworkManager instead just use the network service.

Please help.

Hi Kenneth,

I had inserted the SIM in wrong direction. Can you tell me whether any IF
device is created in the network-scripts folder. Because now wvdial shows
that I have got an IP and DNS, however the resolv.conf does not show the new
DNS and also I am unable to ping anything.

Regards,
Ashish

Hello,

This question came up a while ago and "abrotman" on #debian
just gave a nice answer so I'm passing it on.

Q: You are giving up a computer and would like to erase all
   data on it. Howto?

A: (courtesy dpkg bot on #debian on irc.debian.org and abrotman)
   extra, extra, read all about it, dban is http://www.dban.org/
   Darik's Boot and Nuke ("DBAN") is a self-contained boot floppy/CD
   that securely wipes the hard disks of most computers.  DBAN will
   automatically and completely delete the contents of any hard disk
   that it can detect, which makes it an appropriate utility for bulk
   or emergency data destruction.

Regards,

Kapil.

hai,


i tried looking for the wipe algorithm used by DBAN. i couldn't find it on sourceforge either. pls point me to it if you can find it.

there is the screen shot with some info about the algorithm
http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=61951&ssid=39777

it appears to be using the PRNG MT19937 and a DoD- 3 pass wipe. Honestly, the wipe is not good enough. well actually this depends on the power of the adversary. i would recommend that you use a Gutmann wipe with a larger number of wipe passes.

Oh, well it uses a Gutmann wipe! Maybe a few more passes. But its going to get real slow.

My issue was with the "route" set up. The system was using NIC instead of
the modem to send packets. So I changed that and I was able to use
everything fine.

Normally files should not be stored in databases.
But you can use BLOB datatype for storing files in  database.

Instead, Use a specific folder to upload all your files.

NCOSS-09: National Conference on Open Source Software May 25th - 26th,
2009, Mumbai, India

* * *  CALL FOR PAPERS  * * *

NCOSS - 2009 is being conceived of as a forum to bring together the
various groups working on developing Open Source Applications catering
to specific domains in the ICT world, including education, health,
accessibility, localisation, e-commerce, disaster management, expert
systems, machine learning, etc. A number of high quality software
solutions are available in many of these areas, for example, SugarCRM,

require a combination of domain knowledge and development expertise.
Much of the public awareness in open source is focussed on desktop,
operating system and general productivity tools. With this background,
NCOSS-09 has chosen to focus on the layer above this, bringing
together groups working on various application domains.

The conference will present experiences in deploying FOSS
applications, comparative studies among competing software solutions,
efforts in adapting and localising FOSS applications, development of
new applications, etc.

The conference will consist of the following: Invited talks by experts
from India and abroad, Presentation of contributed papers selected
based on refereeing by a panel of referees, Exhibition by industry and
academia, Pre conference Tutorials (on May 24th), Panel discussion.

Papers are invited on the topics listed below. All papers will be
subject to external refereeing and acceptance will be subject to
referee evaluation. Accepted papers will be published in the
conference proceedings. We also invite proposals for tutorials.

* * * TOPICS * * *

Accessibility,Machine Learning and Data Mining, Indian Language
Computing, e-Health, Localisation, Knowledge Management, e-Learning,
Collaboration Technologies, Information Extraction and Retrieval,

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] A future in quantum computing???
Message-ID: <3232b7ed0812220823p95aad95w16a7603cd4be2477@mail.gmail.com>

I have been wondering over a long course of time what I must specialize
in during my MS (and possible PhD). I most certainly am not planning to
work in a traditional IT company. I need a workplace that will be
challenging
and I most certainly dont mind a lil' risk.

This news items provided one of those moments when I feel a tingling in
me. *http://tinyurl.com/9m6n4w*

I am an IT 3rd year student. I know that understanding of quantum physics
might be essential for pursuing higher education in Quantum Computing. I
am planning to work on algorithm development in QC. My groundwork told
me that it was the closest edge to my current line. I have always been
interested in algorithms and their analysis.

So. Which are the universities that provide quality research in Quantum
Sciences? What are the chances of getting into them. If they are not M.S.
courses, what will be the qualifying P.G. degree for them?

Also, I would like to understand the groundwork i have to do with respect
to prepping for this choice of mine. Like what are the Physics books I have
to dust out from the library? Is there a place that would provide project
options for me to research on during my fourth year thereby being a little
more than a student to gazed to the stars and said "I could have been there"

I know this is way off topic. But this is the only place where there are
diverse
people together. I have the best chances of an answer here.

:D

student from VIT.

But thanks for the link, the article was awesome :) !!

I can think of a few people who are interested in quantum computing
and various aspects of it:

1. K. R. Parthasarathy of ISI, Delhi who has been giving courses 
   on Quantum Information Theory at various places. He would be able
   to tell you quite a bit about the mathematics of QC.

2. R. Simon and Sibasish Ghosh of IMSc, Chennai who recently ran
   a workshop on "Entanglement" followed by a two day conference
   on Quantum Matter and Quantum Information.

3. J. Radhakrishnan of TIFR, Mumbai who works on Algorithms and
   Randomness and is interested in QC as well.

I have provided you with with one person to contact in each of the
theoretical aspects Mathematics, Physics and CS in that order. I
don't know who works on the experimental aspects.

I do know that there used to be a simulator for a quantum computer
that was available as a package in Debian. Perhaps you can try it
out.

Kapil.

Message-ID: <e3dcb5360812220952g644eee3at1f296379097e68bd@mail.gmail.com>

Vellore IT Associated had organized a day of 'Ubuntu Dawn' for its members
and general public on Dec 21, 2008 at Hotel Aavana Inn, Vellore. More than
forty people from Vellore, Aarani and other places of Vellore district got
benefitted as a result of this event.

Different modes of Ubuntu installation, Package handling techniques, Tamil
features in Ubuntu, Fonts installation, Installation of addicted Windows
application using Wine were among various topics covered at the event. While
the proprietary accounting application Tally got installed and ran
successfully using Wine, it was suggested by Ubuntu Tamil Team that, as a
first Step, the resellers and users of Tally Solutions, compel the Tally
Corporation to provide them a debian installable also(1). We expressed hope
that alternatives are being looked at by the Community and soon a Free
Software replacement would emerge for Tally. A handbook on Ubuntu Basics was
also provided(2).

Siva and Sri Ramadoss from Ubuntu Tamil Team conducted the event. We thank
Sairam, other office bearers and members of Vellore IT association for
providing us with this oppurtunity. Photos will be shared soon..

(1) Ubuntu Tamil Team also requests, if you are an existing User of Tally,
to compel Tally Solutions to provide a debian installable for its releases.
You can write to support@tallysolutions.com. Website:

Please give your feedback directly to the organizers of the conference. 
IMO that will have more meaning.  Bharathi Subramanian simply forwarded 
the announcement to this list.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

nohup -- Run a command even after HangUP(logout).

Summary:

`nohup' runs the given COMMAND with hangup signals ignored, so  that
the command can continue running in the background after you log out.
`nohup' does not run the command in the background. We have do it by
ending command line with an `&'.

Examples:

Create a test script :

$ cat > myscript
  sleep 60
  echo Bharathi
  date

Press Ctrl+D to save and exit.

$ chmod 555 myscript -- Add execute permission.

$ nohup ./myscript & -- Run the script in background.

$ logout -- Logout the session.

Again login after 2 mins.

$ cat nohup.out -- All output of the program will redirected to 
                   this file.

Read: man nohup

Hi,

Below is what all I did.

1) Inserted the Modem
2) Using the relevant output from /proc/bus/usb/devices I ran the below
command:

#modprobe usbserial vendor=*0x*1b7d product=*0x*070a

2) Ran the wvdialconf command. This generated a /etc/wvdial.conf file

My wvdial.conf file looks like below I added a parameter or two from the
internet:

[Dialer Defaults]
Init1 = ATZ
Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
Modem Type = USB Modem
Phone = #777
ISDN = 0
Username = internet
Password = internet
Modem = /dev/ttyACM0
Baud = 460800
; SetVolume = 0
; FlowControl = Hardware (CRTSCTS)
; Dial Command = ATDT
Stupid Mode = 1

3) My #lsmod |grep -i usb output is as below:

usbserial              40272  0
hci_usb                23068  2
bluetooth              59044  8 bnep,rfcomm,l2cap,hci_usb

*I am not sure whether it is a must or not, but I removed the usb_storage
module because per the internet, It creates conflicts on the device or
something like that.

4) Since I had other netwok devices setup too, my "route -n" showed that
access to 0.0.0.0 be made via my bridge device kbr0. So I deleted that entry
and made another one indicating that 0.0.0.0 be access via ppp0 device.

5) I ran the wvdial command and my device started to work. I got an IP and
DNS IPs. I also added the opendns IPs to the resolv.conf file.

Note: I do not use the NetworkManager service instead I use the network
service. I guess the NM service automates most of the things. Since it is
changes some of the setting by itself, I do not use it.

Ashish

Just to add to Kapil's post, I do not know  enough about current 
syllabus, but linear algebra, probability and statistics are critical in 
understanding QC.

Further, Quantum computing is a very different thing from quantum 
storage and quantum cryptography. Pick the right area of interest :)

As far as QC is concerned, we have algorithms for searching, sorting and 
string matching. (Incidentally, one of the string matching algorithms is 
from IISC, Bangalore).

If you are interested in storage, read the Feynman's essay "There is 
plenty  of room at the bottom" *

USB modems often present two configurations -- mass storage and modem.
On initial connect, the modem presents the USB mass storage
configuration to the host PC for the drivers to get installed and
loaded from it, and then switches to modem configuration for
operational use.

When vendors ship windoze setup.exe in the mass storage, and you are
using GNU/Linux, using usb_modeswitch [1] will help in switching the
configuration for modem operation.

Yes. Python is easy to learn.
Welcome to the developer world!

You can do a lot of stuff in python.
Scripts, GUI apps, web apps, database apps, games etc.

First Learn python.
The book "A byte of python" will be a nice start.
work on the examples on that.

Then, start writing small scripts like parsing log files, small
database apps etc.

Now you will be better at python.

Then search in net for existing projects.
Your hands on experience will make you to understand the existing code.

search in sourceforge.net or code.google.com for more projects.

Wishes.

I am interested in Quantum computing. I did a little research on all three
before my first mail. I found that all three intersted me. But the order was

Probably a bit on Quantum computing architecture. But predominantly
algorithms.

Welcome to the community of Python enthusiasts. Well, I wonder how the 
statement """

I have been surfing in the net to get the
source code of some projects but all proved to be vain . so can anybody help
in this regard by directing me to a proper source.

"""is possible because I got this - 
http://code.google.com/hosting/search?q=label%3aPython

You can start learning python from this wonderful book on Python written 
by one of our fellow Indians - http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python

And for asking doubts, you can make use of ChennaiPy 
(http://groups.google.com/group/chennaipy) or Bangpypers 
(http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/bangpypers), or you can log 
into #python.

Hi,
     I needed to run windows and other operating systems on my debian etch
system and hence i installed qemu which was referred in one of the previous
mails in this mailing list . What I would very much like to know is if there
is some way of reading data from an external source from within a virtual
system? For example suppose I am running windows
on qemu can I access some part of the debian file system from within
windows? Also can i attach a usb and read the data from the usb?

Virtual network access allows you to use samba or nfs from within the
virtual os.

For file transfer you may find ssh easier.

For transferring a single file you may find netcat easier still.

All of this applies to any two computers connected via a network of
course. In the virtual case, the "network" is virtual and so transfers
are significantly faster. :)

I am not an expert, but would like to attend the workshop. Is the workshop
open
to outsiders. If so, how can I enroll?

If you know C++, I think the first couple of topics in Dive into Python
would do to get you started. After that, The Python Challenge, Project Euler
and Googling when ever you hit a snag would be the most efficient and most
interesting way to become proficient.

Unfortunately i am not familiar with samba or nfs, I know about their
existence though. Have never tried them out and don't want to at the moment
as i believe the learning curve to do sistart it is a bit high.

Indeed ssh is eady and i made it work. However i still do not know how to

What is the error that you received. Did you first boot theVM with -usb
option. If yes, then you can use the add usb from host using usb_add devname
at the qemu prompt.

You can use the SSHSecureShellClient-3.2.9 to copy files using SSH. I guess
there is a similar software for putty too.

I start qemu like below. I do not get any prompt from qemu. After the boot
command all i get is diagnostic messages

$/usr/bin/qemu -boot c -m 128 -hda '/home/abdullah/vms/Windows' -usb  -net
nic,vlan=0 -net user,vlan=0 -localtime

Could not open '/dev/kqemu' - QEMU acceleration layer not activated
-usb_add /dev/sdb1

Is there a way to start  qemu such that i get a prompt to type in further
commands?

ok will try that.

By the way I have used virtual box before on windows when i was evaluating
various linux distros one year back. I was primarily a windows user back
then. I used to occassionally(rarely) log into linux. However that changed
once i installed virtualbox and started running varios distros. Some of the
distros i checked out were ubuntu, FreeBSD, Fedora, redhat, openSuse,
Slackware and many others. I was highly impressed by the GNU tools and the
documentation of those tools. I remember being very impressed by rms'
documentation of emacs and the software itself.

And now the plot has completely changed. I have installed debian and I am
going to stick with it for some time. However, I want to occassionally run
Windows, so that I can create apps on linux and test them on Windows to give
them to my friends who are still
behind bars (read windows).

I have installed virtual box on ubuntu before and i had no problem. However
I am having some problem installing it on debian. I know it is my problem,
in the sense that I have made some mistake in installation and
configuration. However, the bottom line is i am too lazy to read all the
docs to rectify my mistakes.

I would very much like to use virtualbox for the time being at least over
qemu as qemu is pretty slow and also I know how to operate virtualbox as it
is really dumb to operate it.

Any suggestions will be welcom.

Abdullah

This is not a fatal error message. Only that it will run a tad slower
that is all.  No big deal. It is still fast enough for most purposes.

FreeBSD has nothing to do with linux. It is an OS and not a distro. I am
sorry for nitpicking. That wasn't the intention.

There is no concept of distro outside the linux world.

If you want to really learn any OS you have to run on bare metal.

Virtualization makes things more complicated.

You could try asking in mailing lists. Well there is no need to read all
the documentation. But you could at least read the relevant sections to
rectify your problems and march ahead.

Agreed, sometimes we get stuck and we get busy with other things. That
is the way things work unfortunately.

I have had situations where it has taken months to rectify something.
Even a year or so in rare cases.

Why do you want to layer virtualbox over qemu?

Anyway I may be lacking in context. Kindly excuse me.

Best of luck with linux.

I am sure Debian is the right choice.

I am not sure of this error. I would check if the kqemu module has been
modprobed before I start the VM.
I actually use the kvm module. You can use the qemu-kvm command prompt if
you have kvm_intel or kvm_amd modules.

When you boot the VM, press ctrl+alt+2 to get to the qemu prompt. At the
(qemu) prompt type info and you will get all possible commands.

Are you using a 64 bit version of Debian. Virtualbox gets installed by force
on a 64bit OS, however, to get it working it requires 32 bit shared
libraries, my fedora has similar 64 bit one's so I was not able to use
Virtualbox and I could not locate all the packages required to facilitate
the 32bit support. One thing I am going to try is, to install a rhel4 on a
VM and the install vbox on that rhel4 and then copy over the libraries to my
host system. That may work.

Hi,
      Does anyone here know how to implement a progress bar in C that
displays a series of '=' on the command line when run. I intend the
progressbar to look like :

I intend to use system("echo ="); Is that the way it is done? Also how is it
possible to display the progress bar correctly when the user adjusts the
command line window? I remember seeing such type of progressbars in rpm.

Few days back there was a discussion on the 'dialog' utility, which 
Has this capability. It is a shell utility written in C. 

Check this out.

According to the website, Its a broadband connection,
with 2.4Mbps, Unlimited data transfer, at Rs 250/month!.. I think its

How does python discipline the coder? By its syntax?

I have been programming in PHP for a while and I had no problems in
learning other languages. In fact learning other languages like java,
python or perl was very easy for me.

It's 550 Rs I think. In Chennai it is only available in some
outskirts. You can see the full list here.
http://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/EVDO_BTS.htm

I have been waiting for a while for the connection in my area. But
still no luck.

A lot of people are running it in Linux too.

Progress -- http://progress.unixdev.net/ is another simple tool ported

Simple C code - without any data validation

void pbar(int width,int percent)
{
int a;
    printf("\r[");
    for(a=0;a<(percent*width/100);a++) printf("=");
    printf(">");
    for(;a<width;a++) printf(" ");
    printf("]%d%%",percent);
}

Displays the number also on the same line but....

just because one can write code in a language does not imply that one is a 
programmer. I am told that it takes at least 10 years of hard work to become 
a programmer - I have been writing code for the last 22 years, but still do 
not consider myself a programmer. Python and other languages enforce certain 
practices that php doesnt.

One example is that one can embed php code in a html page which can directly 
access a database/filesystem and nuke it. You cannot do that in python. There 
are a few genuine programmers on this list who could surely give better 
examples.

It sounds good. But with a wireless network, you will not have the
connection
during rains and also if you are inside your house, it is going to work
slower
than you expected. It is also at 2.4Mbps in certain areas of the city

It may be possible if you manage to put the file in some place where
the web server serves it. I am not sure whether  the web server will
treat .html files the same way it treats php files. It should be
possible with python too isnt it? You could place a python file (not
html) in a directory where the web server executes it.

afaik a .php file is nothing but a .html file with php code in it

that is what cgi is all about - web server executes python files.

Well, i did'nt mean to say that it was an error message. Just wanted to show
that I was not getting a prompt to type anything into. However the next mail

Check the mail by Ashish or press Ctrl+Alt+2 after starting qemu

Yes sir, point noted. However, I knew that FreeBSD is a descendent of BSD
and a variant of Unix and has nothing to do with Linux.

I don't want to learn Windows !!! I just need to run it (*on Linux* not on
bare metal).

I just wanted to know if people in this mailing list already knew the answer
and already have the experience so that I don't have to wait a year or join
another mailing list(s).


> Why do you want to layer virtualbox over qemu?


I guess I just confused you. My only objective is to run another OS
specifically Windows and other stuff as well, whether qemu or virtualbox. I
prefer virtualbox for the speed as well as "ease" of use (at least for me).
However, as i said earlier I just messed up the installation.

Best of luck with linux.

Wow !!! Thanks for that wonderful piece of info. I never knew that it would
be displayed right on the screen. Now that was good.

By the way how do i get back to Windows after pressing ctrl+alt+2.

That seems to be very specific. I feel progress or some general purpose
library is better
suited. Of course. Every distro's CLI installer will have some notion of a
progress bar.

Yes you can.  See of PSP (python server pages) section of mod_python:
    http://www.modpython.org/live/current/doc-html/pyapi-psp.html

So does this make python a bad language?

When comparing languages, it's best to keep out differences in their libraries
and focus on core language features.


My personal gripe with PHP is that support for namespaces was added very late.
This defect has probably lead to the ugly function names you find all over
PHP -- timezone_transitions_get(), xml_set_processing_instruction_handler().

Just look at the length and style inconsistencies in those function names:
    http://in2.php.net/quickref.php

Other languages -- python, perl, ruby, tcl, etc -- all implemented namespaces
and encouraged programmers to use it.  Namespaces are a good thing.

For file transfer, you need the command line pscp.exe scp client from the
putty website.

Or better yet, get the WinSCP gui client from http://winscp.net/

it would if it was a core feature that comes with python - third party things 
cannot be blamed on the language. Zope also permits embedding python code in 
templates, but to a very limited extent with paranoid security controls.

And let me add mine. I'm not very familiar with PHP and how it's coded 
elsewhere, but I once had to integrate a rather popular open source PHP 
blogging/forums engine into an existing RoR setup. OMG. The code made me 
weep. Perhaps it's too much to expect MVC wherever there is database 
access code?

I don't know if the lack of encouragement of a particular pattern does 
it or what, but the code was a tangle of mess. Perfect spaghetti code. 
DB access code strewn all over display code. Lack of proper naming 
conventions. Similar code written copy-pasted all over the place with 
little changes without any thought to modularity. Obviously, that put me 
off PHP for quite a while. I hear things are changing with Symfony and 
CakePHP.

But then, if people are really going to write new db-driven webapps, 
there are much better alternatives like Django/RoR now.

That's right. It isn't fair to blame the language for poorly written 
code either.

I'm not so sure. PHP is not exactly a general purpose language. It's 
meant for writing web apps. And db-driven ones at that. They are bound 
to get big sooner or later. Not providing for re-use and maintainability 
is a fairly big omission, imho.

*shrug*. Buzzwords mean nothing. As with any language, things have 
organically grown to fit more and more things the original implementors 
hadn't envisioned and over a period of time, some of the things, that 
looked bright at one point aren't that good of a idea, anymore.

PHP allows more people to hack together something and since the barrier 
to entry is low, you get more quick hacks than anything else. More of 
the mainstream apps like mediawiki or wordpress, probably offers a 
better perspective compared to a random PHP web app. I suggest, looking 
into those.

I would image a typical use case for php is to connect to a backend
DB and generate html.  In this situation, I can't understand why a DB
abstraction layer is also not a part of the standard libraries.

I can't get why mysql_*(), mysqli_(), pg_*(), etc still exist when we
have adodb, peardb, etc.

    What does this reflects? Are you such a bad programmer or still trying
to become a programmer.Then should study some basic course in programming to
get your fundamentals right. Any tom , dick or harry cannot do good
programming.. , yes they can write programs to make themselves happy but not
good programs (which are defect free and serves the intended purpose).

Pretty much all the languages have db specific interfaces. I know 
atlteast, two reasons:

* Can't abstract away everything. The are many db specific unique 
features you might want to take advantage of.

* Compatibility. Nobody wants to keep rewriting the same code over and 
over again.

   Totally agree with this. Language gives features, syntax and standards ,
its the programmers job to write good readable and manageable code.

Does what make python a bad language?

It is a great language.

The list of good languages in my own unusually partial opinion are C,
perl, python, lua and javascript.

Perhaps someone posted this here before, but anyway, here is a link
explaining why classifying languages as "good" or "bad" is bad![1]
 
 http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2000/12/advocacy.html

Moral: Read as many good programs as you can find and you will pick
up an idea about what language to use where.

How to find good programs? Answer is another motto I saw somewhere:

 A well-written program should not only run efficiently and properly
 on real computers but must also be easy for humans to read.

This sets the standards rather high, but so what?!

Regards,

Kapil.

[1] I always thought of Fortran as a terrible language to program in
until I read the original "adventure" game program.

Not true. The FreeBSD based router m0n0wall uses php for all of it's
startup/init
scripts. There's nothing intrinsically webbish about php although the original
intent was to cook up something similar to ASP (from whatever I have gathered
by listening to Rasmus Lerdorf at FOSS.in) .

As for python based templating systems that allow python code and html to be
mixed together, there are quite a few - Kid, for instance.

Classic case of 'Worse is better'.

Hi!

A friend of mine wants to try out distros, so any chance in chennai where he
could buy distro CDs at sane prices?

am from mangalore and here Dr.Neville of mangalore LUG sells distro cds at
Rs.10 (the cost of the CD-R) nothing extra. (this is really helpful for
people wanting to try out distros but have no time/bandwidth/patience to
download the images all by themselves)

so is there someone similar in chennai? if so, please let me know the
addresses and phone numbers so i could pass same information along to my
friend, thank you and have a good day :)

minor number and then mounting it or else formatting the device using fdisk.
Or even dd'ing zero's to the initial bytes of the device.

Do you think this is a sane idea.
If yes, I want to know how to find out the major and minor number for the
device.
If no, what should i do.

I found device related information coming up in the below path, It contains
many files and folders like drivers and devices. When I try to grep for
major or minor, I get nothing but errors; lot of errors about loops and
symlinks.

/sys/class/mmc_host/mmc0

Message-ID: <d8f31330812261404l551841c9qffedd805cdf891a6@mail.gmail.com>

All,
This is related to USB wireless adapter configuration in Ubuntu Hardy Heron.
I was not able to configure it successfully thought I spent considerable
amount of effort today.
[image: http://media.dsgibusiness.com/img/products/NETWG111.jpg]
I am using NetGear WG111 USB wireless LAN adapter. Since I found wireless
option is not listed in the System>Administration>Network. After spending
some time in google I need to install ndiswrapper windows driver. I uploaded
the inf file. I added an entry to issue *sudo modprobe ndiswrapper *I found

*FATAL: Module ndiswrapper not found.*

After some googleing I found linux-headers need to added and ndiswrapper
need to be compiled once again. I did it with synaptic. and make and make
install of ndiswrapper also finished. Still I am not able to make my network
up.

The network manager still lists only the Wired connection and P-2-P
connection, but not wireless connections.

Did any of you configured it successfully. Can you give me some inputs in
this?

Thanks

Try to follow the instructions at:

They are step by step instructions.

If this fails, then please indicate at which step the instructions
failed and what the error message was.

Is this the only message from dmesg? In that case you are probably
out of luck. 

If not, then please post the relevant output from dmesg at the point
when you plug in the card.

For both Ekalavya and Arjuna whether the person infront is Drona or his idol
doesn't matter.

For the rest even if Drona comes and teaches it doesn't matter much.

But what a user desires is something which does what he wants and not what a
programmer can do or his programs are capable of or the power of programming
language he has used..

that way, on date, php satisfies more users more than other languages..

hope other geeks and greats understands this..

1. The card is not fully recognized -- maybe an unrecognizable filesystem?

2. The card reader is recognized. You can check and provide outputs of:

  /bin/lspci
  /bin/lsmod | grep sd

3. Which distro? Which kernel? Which SD card?

4. Did you try the card through a USB 4-in-1 card reader?

They are meant for querying for information. /sysfs is newer.

Subject: [Ilugc] Wireless cards available locally that work on Debian
Message-ID: <1230488401.6651.28.camel@mjolnir>

Hi everyone,

I'm Roshan George, and I live in Chennai. I've been looking for a
wireless card for a desktop that I recently got from a friend. The thing
is, while the Intel wireless card on this laptop works without any
effort, I've had quite a bit of trouble getting the Netgear WG311 to
work on another desktop we have at home, though I did eventually manage
by using ndiswrapper.

Looking around in local stores I've only seen the following models:

* Linksys WMP54G
* D-Link DWL G510
* D-Link DWA 510
* The D-Link DWL-G520 is available from rediff, but I think Rs. 2100 is
an absurd price for a wireless card.

What wireless cards would you recommend that I can get locally? I have
an 802.11-g network at home using WEP, and the way the rooms are located
using an ethernet cable is simply out of the question. I'm planning on
using Debian Etch for the computer with this card, but I wouldn't mind
running a newer distribution (though I'd prefer to stay with
Debian-based ones). Also, do any of those cards listed above work on
Linux? The web gives conflicting answers.

Thank you,

Check if you can get any of the listed ones locally.
http://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/net/wireless/cards.html

I would suggest you use debian lenny (expected release Jan - already 4
months behind schedule, but AFAIK only thing that holding back the
release is the installer and that is expected to be out in jan)

WEP can be cracked (with relative ease), it is almost as good as setting 
your WiFi AP w/o any encryption. Pls. consider using WPA or WPA2.

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0812281954l1e2a0ba8q21e7664b4b60eb76@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

My friends doing their college project,
decided to do their project in PHP and will release as open source.

They have experience in PHP.

To make the project to be collabrative and continuous development,
I suggested them to follow any framework.

like cakephp, symphony etc.

I dont have experience on the frameworks.


Which framework is rich in futures?
Give me your suggestions.

Thanks.

I would recommend that you try Codeigniter. My experience with CakePHP was
that it was too complicated and way too configuration heavy. From what I
have seen of symphony (never used it), it seems pretty heavy as well.

Codeigniter is simpler and though lacking in some of the bells and
whistles of CakePHP, it is nonetheless pretty powerful.

It doesn't look like any of those are available (except perhaps the
WMP54G, I should check the version available). Do you know of a store
that sells a card other than the following?

Very well, should I wait till January until it is released or will it
make no difference if I download whatever Lenny version is currently
distributed and upgrade that as time goes on? I remember Ubuntu's
upgrades being notoriously unreliable.

Thank you,

Thank you, I did take this into account when first setting up the
router. However, at the time, it was very hard to get WPA working
(considering that I had to use ndiswrapper to get wireless on one
desktop) and so I settled for WEP. After searching the Internet, I came
to the conclusion that I was safe because the only time I use my card is
when I'm on secure websites (ones with a signed SSL certificate)? My
mail server also uses TLS. Am I at risk despite this?

Message-ID: <37dc0f330812290404n2b3fb24ue1860d20bb6f59a@mail.gmail.com>

hi

I wish to download a bunch of files from a site which allows directory
listing
with links like

http://38.106.111.111/folder/sub%20folder/sub%20folderl%201/
zYWIxNDQ2ODliZDhhMTc4NzRjMGQwMzY/
file%201.zip

afkafkajfkljlkfjiejjflkjlFJLKJFLAY/
file%205.zip

As you can see, the second line of the link changes with every link
The file name is a combination of sub folder name and .zip

Could anybody point  me to a library or modules to explore a given
website to gather all the links in the site?

After which I can apply a filter to extract only those I need and pass
the list to wget or the like

Am looking for python or perl libraries

Thnx

wget can probably do everything you are looking for.

Recursively fetch files (use with caution):
    http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Recursive-Download

Use the include/exclude filters to selectively download files.

www.aircrack-ng.org can actually recover the WEP key itself.

Using the WEP key, an attacker can connect to your wireless router
and become a part of your LAN.  After that the attacker can access your
LAN clients, use your internet bandwidth, etc.

WEP is bad.

If you have a hackable wireless router (something that runs openwrt),
you can handle the wireless encryption at a higher layer by using openvpn
or ipsec between the wireless clients and the router.

I see such links only  on sites that dont want you to do what you
just mentioned you need to do.

eg. Rapidshare uses it to prevent usage of download managers other
than their own. They also use it to prevent resuming downloads.

SDN uses it to prevent someone from repeatedly downloading a file
and using up their bandwidth and for promoting their own Sun
Download Manager that can resume and stop. I can do that with
aria2c as long as the download is resumed within a day or 2/
( I can't think of a different reason why Sun does that)

In either case, you were not meant to download it without human
intervention.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

timeout -- Send a signal to a program after a certain timeout.

Summary:

'timeout' executes a program (with arguments args) and sends a signal
(like KILL, TERM etc) to it after a certain amount of seconds. It is 
from NetaTalk Project.

Examples:

$ timeout 10 ping localhost -- Run the Ping program and send, by
                             default, a SIGTERM after 10 seconds.

$ timeout -s KILL 10 ping localhost -- Same as above. But here KILL 
           Signal will be send to the Ping Program after 10 seconds.

$ timeout -s HUP 10 sh -- Spawn a shell and send a hangup signal after 
                          10 seconds.

$ timeout -s 1 10 sh -- Same as above. Signal #1 == HANGUP.

Read: man timeout & man 7 signal

HTH :)

 Based on my experience synfony+doctrine PRM+memcache has proved to be
most stable and scalable combo. In one scenario we are serving rought
1.5 million pages everyday.

 I did mailed to email address mentioned in the announcement but it

Choosing an Ideal Framework, is all about the requirement of the project,
for example if the application is going to deployed in the dedicated hosting
then Symfony is the best one. other wise  you could choose anything else.

Code generation, Symfony provides the option to generate the code depends on
the structure of the model layer.

Time, Symfony is vast, if you have enough time to invest on learning and
doing home work, before you kickstart your work then go ahead with the
Symfony.

Symfony could be a base for promoting the development of enterprise  class
solution with the PHP.

Last but not least Symfony could do wonders if you know how you use it
correct way. Its been supported by an most active community and extensive
documentations.

Hey,

It was really heartening to see you code for the cause of Tamil, last
Saturday. Two years back, while taking up translations work (than coding as
priority), thought there are lot of techies around and there will be enough
number of  programmers coming forward to code and contribute for Tamil after
seeing discussions in mailing lists around.

That turned out to be a myth. At times used to feel, even deaf and dumb
(with due respect to them) used to get more encouragement and contributions
than people knowing to read, write and communicate effectively in Tamil
alone.

Hats off to you & all programmers who code for the cause of their respective
languages & society. Hope more people join the efforts and myth becomes
reality.

Cheers!

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

ogginfo -- Gives information about Ogg files.

Summary:

OGG Vorbis is a new audio compression format. It is different from
these other formats because it is completely free, open & unpatented.
It is roughly comparable to other formats used to store & play digital
music, such as MP3, VQF, AAC, and other digital audio formats.

ogginfo reads one or more Ogg files and prints information about
stream contents. It will detect a wide range of common defects, with
many additional checks specifically for Ogg Vorbis streams.

Examples:

$ locate .ogg -- Search for some OGG files in your system.

$ ogginfo /usr/share/redhat-credits.ogg -- Show the detailed info 
                                           about that ogg file.

$ ogginfo -q /usr/share/redhat-credits.ogg -- Show warning and errors
                                              messages.

$ ogginfo -qq /usr/share/redhat-credits.ogg -- Show only errors.

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0812302233y721b7274lf8fec0d9d29307b4@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

My friend has a BSNL WLL phone.

He wants  to connect to internet through the usb cable connected to the phone.

He has ubuntu 8.04

I tried to guide him.

The command "lsusb" makes the terminal hang.

Do you have experience with the BSNL WLL phone?

Thanks.

If you haven't still figured this out, the simplest way to do this is through
Virtual VFAT. Virtual VFAT enables to access a host directory as a hard disk.
To a -hd[abcd] option pass the host directory path prefixed by 'fat:' as
shown below

  $ qemu -hda myhd.img -hdb fat:/host/dir/path

Within the guest system, the directory tree under '/host/dir/path' will
be available as a separate drive.

Many web pages explain only basics of plugin design.(eg. activate,deactivate

I need something more than that.Eg*.Underlining a mispelled

It will be nice if you can send any useful urls or details , which

Hi Ramadoss,
There is no point in getting frustrated. Everyone has their own limited time
& have their priorities in life. You cannot demand contributions.

If you dont get good response, you have to look inwards and see how you can
make your project tempting enough for other contributors to jump in.

More important is how motivated you or the creator of the project
is(irrespective of whether u get contribution or not).

Not at all Mugunth. I can understand. That was not expression of frustration
but rather a inward question Why?

For various reasons, many of which share a common trait with the general 
lack of Indian contributors to FOSS. A few I can think of:

* With a diverse set of cultures and India misguidedly divided into 
states based on languages and with a history of education, governance 
and English as the common language based on British rule, the education 
system is not conductive to higher studies on your native tongue in 
India. This spills itself over to computers as well.

* Unless the hardware costs go down significantly, the use of computers 
are going to be limited to a elite segment which already understands 
English and doesn't feel the need for localization.

* Free and open source software is still very much a small niche in the 
desktop market and that is unlikely to change significantly soon.

* LUG's in India are still largely limited to idealizing or 
troubleshooting end user issues rather than a inherently contributor 
oriented culture.

* Access to Internet and especially good broadband always-on connections 
that spurred the growth of FOSS elsewhere is still a limited thing in India.

a very important factor - who does translations? Not software developers. The 
people who do are the endusers who *require* translation. You want a tamil 
translation of say, drupal. You will only get it when someone wants to build 
a drupal based site in Tamil - not before. There are a few people like Amachu 
or Kartik Mistry and some others who translate for love of their native 
language - but these are exceptions. I would warrant that 90% of the web 
developers on this list - or developers on this list - do not write i18n 
code. They do not feel the need - there *is* no need. And translation where 
there *is* a need is a very trivial matter. I once developed a site where 
there was a need for both english and finnish. All I did was send the 
relevant .po files to the client, she dug up poedit in windows and did the 
needful in a day or two - and still updates it when needed. 

So go create endusers in local languages for your software - translations will 
happen.

Hi All,

I am completely new to this field. I only have some knowledge of C and other
basic languages like HTML and javascript. I am trying to write an
interactive/automated script to start the VMs on my machine.

So a part of that is to list all the iso's in my system and let the user
select which one to use in the VM. I have done the following:

list_iso()
{
varX=CD
varY=0
locate *.iso > /temp/cdromlist
cat /tmp/cdromlist | while read count; do
varY=$(expr $varX + 1)
echo "$varX$varY is $count" # this displays as CD1 is /vms/rhel4.iso
#Assign the value of the path to unique variable
varZ="$varX$varY # This makes varZ equal to CD1
$varZ=$count  # Now this should make a variable CD1 hold the value
/vms/rhel4.iso just like the path variable but I get error for  this
indicating "No such file or directory".

...........
}

Please advise

Regards,
Ashish
