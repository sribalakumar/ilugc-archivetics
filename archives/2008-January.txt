        While we are guessing wildly, it could also be that people leave
 because of the low signal to noise ratio caused by emails like the
 grandparent.

        Indeed. Including people who are put off by the high ratio of
 "LoL. Really? Seriously? Seasons greetings. LoL" postings.

Most members are subscribed to more than one list and
imagine the amount of noise they will receive if
people start sending out greetings...

Ubuntu is not the solution to all problems,the gusty
live-cd hangs my amd-nvidia computer.
So many other live-cds like
sidux,sabayon,knoppix,mandriva,suse,puppy, even
austrumi and dsl run beautifully on the same computer.

Live CD are also dependent upon the Media and most problems with Live CD
are due to errors in the Media. This is very true with Ubuntu Live CDs
as far as I have seen. You experience might have been one such. I had
the same when I tried to install Gutsy a week back, but as I had
additional CDs I tried with another CD and it worked like a charm.

Although this might sound a defense to Ubuntu, but it is very much true
to Media of all distributions. It is also true that, a person might have
different experience with different distributions, but please do not try
to generalize anything  on any distro with a few bad personal experiences.

Hi Guys,

I want to setup a local blog, wiki and a document management system
for my company. There is configured share point sever available which
does all the things, but I want to find a linux equivalent of the
same. I saw a software called Knowledge Tree, which seems to be a
document management system, though not sure whether it supports blog
and wiki in it. If there is an better alternative to the software
please share.

PHP -> Drupal
Light weight yet powerful and robust. Ideal for Internet web portals.

Python -> Zope + Plone
Slightly resource hungry (comparatively at least) & more features.
Ideal for Intranet web portal

Dear friend,
Where do you think I got all the distros I have
mentioned from, I downloaded them and cut cds.Why
should Ubuntu's media alone be bad? 
The problem was in the default xorg.conf set up by
gutsy-meant only for 17" crts and lcds.
It is solved in hardy as the new xorg-server has its
own builtin xorg.conf and doesn't depend on the distro
for one, when starting for first time.
Hope that clarifies.
 
TPD.

Thanks for the clarification, but was this reported back to Ubuntu? Is
there a filed bug? Would be good if it was/is, so faults like these
can be corrected :)

You should probably take a look at http://www.alfresco.com/ which has 
being an alternative for sharepoint as a goal.

Not all drivers support jumbo frames. Did you check your network card

In Linux, the hotplug is handled by a bunch of programs.

Message-ID: <328077850801022216i469a60dq111daa2b241c0812@mail.gmail.com>

hi all:
the FOSS Conference brochures have been printed. We will be sending them to
the colleges (engg. & non-engg) in tamil nadu as well as other states. We
will also be coverting the companies under STPI. Will await the outcome of
Raman-Bharathi meeting with Mr. Umashankar before sending to govt agencies.

as for the rest
a) you can send me the contact name(s) &  address(s) and no of brochures to
be sent. We can mail them.
    you could also send me the link(s) where I could pick up the address.
b) you can come to MIT or fix up some suitable point to collect brochures
for your personal distribution.
    [Saravanan, Lynus Academy, could be a nodal point].

I would suggest that you wait till this weekend (or Monday) to collect the
set since we expect the posters also to be ready by then.

Srinivasan, NRCFOSS.

Are you using any local domain in your setup? Check /etc/hostname and
your routing table (/sbin/route -n).

Think your DNS is not resolving. Try
[1] dig google.com
[2] nslookup google.com

You can make use of public DNS - 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2 also.

The output of [1] will be like..

These are not valid nameservers that you can use in your PC. I think
these are name servers of a webhost. Try opendns 208.67.222.222 and
208.67.220.220

hi all:
[I had sent this as a separate mail, but it seems to have vanished from the
network! it may still come up in the list].

the FOSS Conference brochures have been printed. We will be sending them to
the colleges (engg. & non-engg) in tamil nadu as well as other states. We
will also be coverting the companies under STPI. Will await the outcome of
Raman-Bharathi meeting with Mr. Umashankar before sending to govt agencies.

as for the rest
a) you can send me the contact name(s) &  address(s) and no of brochures to
be sent. We can mail them.
    you could also send me the link(s) where I could pick up the address.
b) you can come to MIT or fix up some suitable point to collect brochures
for your personal distribution.
    [Saravanan, Lynus Academy, could be a nodal point].

I would suggest that you wait till this weekend (or Monday) to collect the
set since we expect the posters also to be ready by then.

Srinivasan, NRCFOSS.

ping means these servers are reachable. However, this does not guarantee
that DNS service is available/reachable on that IP. Reliable method is
to invoke digg/nslookup and see if google.com gets resolved.

In my experience, both BSNL and VSNL/TATA DNS service is very patchy.
I'd recommend you change the DNS Server IPs of OpenDNS or any other such
provider.

Message-ID: <6d27208e0801030307o44792e6an886582b6c7445982@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I run Gutsy in my laptop and recently downloaded Puppy Linux to have
it installed on to my 256MB pen drive(sdb). I downloaded the ISO and
used the 'dd' to write the image file to sdb. During this time I also
had connected a USB harddisk.(sda - ntfs).
By mistake I specified sda1 instead of sdb1. I realized it immediately
but I was too scared to press 'ctrl c' fearing it would corrupt the
partition.

The ISO was 46 MB. Size of sda1 is about 45 GB. Now when I try to
mount sda1 it gets mounted as a CDROM drive with puppy linux on it.

I am sure other than those 46 MB all data in sda1 should be intact. Is
there any way that to recover that data or is it possible to recover
overwritten ntfs partition.

Do not know the actual use and am hazarding a shot.

Why use a KVM? Why not use VNC client on one system with server on the 
other. Thus you will be able to see the other desktop native. What you 
would miss out is boot time access. That can be achieved using serial 
terminal access in boot line arguments and a terminal program on the 
second system.

Hi Dhanagopal,

If you are not experimenting on ethernet driver related things / network
related things then
VNC  is a very good option.

Approximate cost of 2 port KVM switch is Rs.1500.

I am not an Oracle DB guy, but if I recall well that error (which is
supposed to be pretty common) generally points to:

o a local copy/cache of the tnsnames.ora file
o how you have configured your db names (and the aliases)
o the configuration of the listener

If you have an access/account for metalink check for a detailed explanation

Is it the final version? Nice brochure, though.

Just a small suggestion, a photo of RMS and Linus
Torvalds could be put up on the second page, (as
available in
http://db.glug-bom.org/wiki/index.php/Linux_Brochure )
 in the last sheet (3rd Column) and the logos of
Philosophies (2nd column, same page) could be
re-arranged according to their labels. Alternatively,
in a Z like fashion, the logo and labels could be put
up side-by-side.

Hi,

   You can use the VNC to view other systems after establish the LAN
connection.You asked for KVM switch.I think that you may not have LAN.

   Some linux distribution are having preinstalled VNC.You may use
this.Unless you have to install the vnc package which can be downloaded from
vnc.com.

Regards,
M.Satheesh.

Dear LUGs,
                After getting guidelines from all, I successfully configured
BSNL Broad band connection in Linux.

             Fault in my side is DNS server IP. This was corrected as per
Mr.Anoop and Mr. Parthan

Thank you very much to all.

I am having two systems at home ( P III and  AMD),
both multibooting with 
ubuntu 7.10 and  windows XP. But I am having only one
monitor, keyboard and 
mouse. I thought of connecting both the systems with
KVM switch to use 
anyone at a time without the hassle of connecting and
disconnecting the 
cables. But the VNC option suggested seems to be
better.  Both systems have 
ethernet. Googling gives lot of tips realvnc/tightvnc
etc. I am confused 
which one will be easy to install and configure. Can
someone guide me?

With regards.

Hi All,

I was trying to install drupal and I have been fighting with the
drupal database configuration today. I used pgsql as my database. I
created the database user and the database as specified in the help
files(http://drupal.org/getting-started/5/install/create-database/mysql).
I was able to login to the pgsql database from the command line.

When I type the url http://localhost/drupal/ it is giving some weird
error on the web page. I have attached the errors at the end of the
mail. I have changed the drupal/sites/default/settings.php file to my
configuration with pgsql and username and dbname. Am i missing
something here ? Please help me.


OS: Debian Etch. I have placed the files in the proper path and have
given proper permissions.

regards,
siva.

remote end, Vim, Vi is really not even worth comparing with Emacs. Vim
on the other hand is what everyone should use !

On a local machine, I've started using Gvim lesser and lesser and
Scribes more and more for all my coding needs.

Emacs has its uses too. Its just that them and me dont overlap much :D

Notepad is cool man. There was a guy in our 1st year class who wrote the
java code in the nodepad and then compiled it with Dr.Java. I don`t know why
he did so...but we really felt pain for him when our faculty seriously took
him to task.

Message-ID: <1199603975.5767.12.camel@tuxbox.freedom>

Hi all,
Will all tutorial sessions take place in a Lab? Because I feel the guys
sitting during the talk need something to keep them hooked. like a
keyboard to work out examples .etc :P..
If yes, where should the speakers ask for the required softwares that
are to be installed in the computers. Nothing blows like a missing
library or a compiler.
And are the speakers for tutorials supposed to give presentations? 
and finally of relatively less importance, will there be internet in the
lab. We could set up a wifi hotspot or something for people with
laptops.

Hi guys,

I reinstalled postgres and Drupal from scratch, and when tried do the
database configuration, it threw the same error. When I modified the
url slightly to http://localhost/drupal/install.php, it started
installing. I don't know it makes any sense, but that's what i did and
it started working.I got the drupal installed now and I am now trying
to figure out how to make a webpage out of it.

Thanks for the help guys.

regards,
siva.

What you need to do is call 3 people ;

1) Call HP
2) Call Red Hat
3) Call Oracle.

All three of them have benchmarking tools and methodologies that I am 
sure they will be quite happy to work with you on.

We are happy to announce the beta launch of our new public service.
You can now request us for any software that is freely available on

the CD/DVD and mail the software to you. As simple as that. The
mission of this project is simple - to promote Open Source software
among those who have limited internet connectivity. You can read more

Thank You Singh, for your valuable information, But I want to give it a try before involving the vendors. Do you know any such test tools that are available freely.

gvim can handle unicode but no complex rendering, which means
essentially mean no indic
xemacs can't even handle unicode. It is supposed to work with emacs 22
gtk port but I was not able to get it working. Any lucky folks here?

unless you plan on stealing the bits, you are not going to get away by

He will be in Kochi on 10th.

Invitation - fwd-

Dear All,

Richard M Stallman, Leader of the Free Software Movement, will be visiting
Kochi on 10th January 2008.

He will deliver a talk on `Free Software in ethics and in Practice' at
the Union Christian College, Aluva, Ernakulam (UC College) campus on
January 10 at 10 am.

The talk will be followed by a question answer session and a press conference.

The talk is being organised by the Union Christian College and
Free Software Foundation of India.

All are invited.


Stallman is the founder of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) which is
dedicated to promoting computer users' rights to study, copy, modify
and redistribute computer programmes. `Free as in freedom' being its
credo, FSF promotes the GNU operating system widely used today in its
GNU/Linux variant, based on the kernel Linux developed by Linus
Torvalds. Worldwide, there are more than 20 million users of GNU/Linux
systems today.

Stallman used what came to be known as `copyleft' to protect the ideal
of his movement and enshrined the concept in the widely used GNU
General Public License. His accomplishments as a programmer include
the text editor Emacs, the compiler GCC and the debugger GDB, all of
which are part of the GNU project.

The maverick crusader, who prefers to be called `rms' wrote in the
first dictionary of hackers that `Richard Stallman is just my mundane
name, you can call me rms.'

The need for free software is crucial for a developing country like
India where there is a constant struggle for cost-effective solutions.
Free software can also help bridge the country's digital divide by
encouraging collaboration and community work among
programmers and users.

Hi,

I think you should rephrase this "software that is freely available on
the internet" unless it is what you really mean.

But I don't think you mean it because what follows in the writeup is:

"The mission of this project is simple - to promote Open Source
software among those who have limited internet connectivity"

You have hardly given us information about what you did, what changes

Try to get your grub's menu.lst from the Linux partition. If you have
only a "/", then use any Live CD to boot the system up, mount the
partition and check "/boot/grub/menu.lst". You should be able to see the
previous grub entry from which you can ask it to reinstall grub on the
Linux Partition. (It should be either hda1 or hda2 depending upon the
swap partition)

hi ...thanks for your suggestions

      i am able to see my /boot/grub/menu.lst, when i try to list my HDD partions those are in the order as mentioned below

          /dev/hda1    win95 FAT32 (LBA)
          /dev/hda2    win95 FAT32 (LBA)
          /dev/hda3    Linux
          /dev/hda4    win95 Ext'd (LBA)
          /dev/hda5    Linux swap 
          /dev/hda6    Linux 


where hda1 and hda2 are C and D drive of Win resp. hda3 is /boot ,hda5 is swap,hda6 is /(root).

As you suggested 
  i tried the following command
            #grub-install /dev/hda
 
  i got the error as /dev/hda does not have any corresponding BIOS drive. The same error repeats even when i mention the partition No (i.e /dev/hda{1-6} )

I did not quite get that part? Freely is not free as in free beer. I
meant free as in readily available. I will change that on the site.
Could you please clarify?

Hi,

Once you get the shell prompt, try this...

# grub (press enter)
grub> root (hd0, 2) (this will specify where to find the /boot partition
grub> setup (hd0)  (this specifies which is your hard disk to install
grub to)
grub> quit
# reboot

Now you should get a proper grub menu. HTH :)

The question is  will you download any software that can be downloaded
without any payment irrespective of the license? Will you also
download pirated software from rapidshare (it is also freely avaible)
if someone requests it.

yes, please change it accordingly to clearly express what you mean by
"freely available".

No No :). We will only promote those software that have OSI approved
Licenses. This is specifically mentioned in the article about the
service <http://www.zyxware.com/articles/2008/01/06/request-your-copy-of-cddvd-of-free-software>.
We are promoting non-GPLed software also because I think that
ultimately what matters is the promotion of alternatives to
proprietary systems. That is why we chose OSI licenses instead of just
GPL. Also we are hardcore against piracy, not just because it is
illegal but I believe that is a very good way to promote FLOSS.

Thanks. Once I saw "freely available on the internet", I did not look further.
However, I think it should be rephrased it to reflect that only those
compatible with OSI will be provided
or else you could get several requests for  warez which are also
available freely :-)

I can work with any editor that will support RegEx find and replace.
Syntax highlight would be an added advantage.

I am comfortable with VIM. Never got off to use Emacs. My every effort
to get the very basics was met with RTFM. I would read them iff I can
happily edit something for the first time and read further for
advanced features. I wouldn't be reading for basic editing :(

The solaris box that my client provides me contains only VI. I can't demand.

At office, I use Windows and quite comfortable with almost any editor
(GVIM, TextPad, EditPlus, Crimson Editor - only the first one is
free). At home, I use a combination of VIM and Kate.

You seemed to have jumped to conclusions... I decided to chip into to
make it approx 2%...

My choice: Emacs for coding, vim for simple scripting and writing
emails. vim is fast, and effective for quick edits. (I also love the
way it syntax highlights just about any type of configuration file!)
Emacs is bulky, but has great keyboard shortcuts for touch-typing.
Gedit sucks. Kate is great, but I stopped using it once I got used to
the emacs way of doing things. It definitely takes some effort to
learn emacs, but its worth it. [DISCLAIMER: personal opinion! I have
heard people from the other camp say exactly the opposite things]

Also, emacs has a psychotherapist. :P

Hi,

I am really amazed by the way the OSS developers reverse engineer RDP
protocol and MPPE alogorithm.

Have a look at this URL

http://efod.se/writings/thesis.pdf

The efforts taken by them is really amazing. How were they able to
withstand that pain. When do they have time to do this. Don't they
sleep? Check the appendix they were even able to find a serious flaw
in the MS RDP client which was publicly reported.

Btb. how legal is it to reverse engineer a software in India. What
does our local law say about it?

I have no words. A great salute to all OSS developers.

I need to get (ShockWave) Flash to work on my AMD64 Debian Etch system. I
installed "libflash-mozplugin", but when I go to
<http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/welcome/>, it shows that the plugin is not
working. Searching for bugs shows
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=366301>, but it is not clear
if this bug is present in Etch.

Has anyone got the same problem? Has anyone got Flash working on AMD64? Is bug
#366301 present on Etch? And is there any other package that provides the same
functionality on AMD64?

I am unsure, but on Debian Lenny, using nspluginwrapper works
perfectly on an AMD64. See this:

You need to decide if a 64-bit OS or a fully working Flash is important for you.

Adobe makes flash available only for 32 bit i386 systems. For 64-bits you need
gnash or swfdec. Both are present in Etch and both are outdated.

Recent version of both packages can play Youtube videos but will fail on some
other sites. If you need full flash functionality which works everywhere install
32-bit firefox and the plugin from adobe website or go completely 32-bit.

let us be realistic about logistics. this is a conference -- more of a
"mela" and not a workshop. while it will be nice to cater to those who take
the trouble to register, we can't stop the floating audience from joining a
session.

If yes, where should the speakers ask for the required softwares that

once the talks are finalised, we can work on this aspect. we can have a set
of "technical volunteers" : each catering to a certain no of speakers. it
the volunteer's job to get the specs  and get the installation done. while
the speakers are welcome to bring in their own laptops (all fully loaded
with the talk material),  we could supplement with a certain no of systems
(I hope a P4 with 1GB RAM should do).

And are the speakers for tutorials supposed to give presentations?

will await further comments/suggestions/requirments before we discuss and
take steps.

nspluginwrapper might still be an option in Etch, if you can get the
Lenny version to run, though I would recommend using Lenny, if the OP
wants to switch...

Though I have seen people argue that 32 bit OSes are better, I somehow
feel better if I use a 64 bit OS on a supporting CPU. Of course, I
cannot back it up with results promising better performance, but just
my feeling...

BTW, I don't have an x86_64, but several friends do. And they can use
Flash because they use Lenny with nspluginwrapper.

Hi,
Many months back I had a problem using yum and other net based
programs,behind the iitm proxies.
Then Kumar Appaiah suggested the ntlmaps method and it worked fine.
But all of a sudden nothing is working again. Any idea why?
Could the proxies have blocked almost all the ports now?
I can't install any linux machines because of this problem. Any ideas?

Thanks
Shiva

Message-ID: <776bc02b0801080945p557d7474q3b53b8a33e195d22@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I tried using Jquery(javascript library released under GPL) today.I have
already used it without any issues but today i did a new download(
Jquery-1.2.1) and started off with this simple script.

$(document).ready(function(){
alert("foobar");
});
The script throws an error in Firebug and it does not work.In firebug it
shows an error that $ function is not defined.$ is not defined in the DOM
field in firebug.I am trying to fix the PNG transparency issue in I.E any
suggested Pluggins.

Check if the script tag has correct version of jquery
in the src attribute, seems like the only likely
problem.

googling gave me these links for png transparency
issue  in jquery...

Thanks for the link.

Hmmm.... won't it be simple if some one can give us a live demo of
simple operations in EMacs? Like basics of opening a file, creating a
new one (buffer???). Perhaps on a LUG meeting?

But I think, I have asked for this too late. I will be out of the
country by this weekend :-)

Subject: [Ilugc] Demonstration of gcc and GNU/Linux usage in Karunkuzhi
Message-ID: <1199904505.5769.60.camel@tuxbox.freedom>

Hi all,
Today afternoon myself and my classmate Manoj Kumar went to the
Government High School, Karunkuzhi, a village about 30 kilometres from
Mahabalipuram on request from my college authorities. We were asked to
give a little demonstration of coding the C++/C programs given in the +2
syllabus. They have a nice set of 5-6 High-end Lenovo ThinkCentre
Machines (with 17 inch widescreen LCD and all), apparently from Elcott
running Suse. 
It was quite interesting to note that the only computer staff there, was
newly appointed and not trained in the GNU/Linux environment, leading to
the computers not being switched on at all for the last 2-3 months (as
told to us).
We showed some example C codes, command line usage of gcc, basics of KDE
(opening oowriter, calc, impress..etc) and moving around the GUI..
Unfortunately the school or the entire village for that matter doesnt
have access to the internet. Otherwise interest in GNU/Linux seems to
pretty high among the students. The fact that the students got to use
computers after a long time may have contributed to the interest.
>From what I asked, there seems to be quite a number of such schools in
the surrounding areas.

If they approach me again, can I redirect them to some experienced
seniors in our community to handle the situation better. How about a
workshop in the future?..
I was quite sad when we came to know that these beautiful computers were
left untouched due to some FUD about GNU/Linux being hard to use.
Hopefully we prevented a school from shifting to a Propreitary Platform
atleast for some tasks =).

I would like to thank my college, Shri Andal Alagar College of
Engineering and the concerned authorities of The Government High School,
Karunguzhi for providing us this oppurtunity. 

Regards..

Hi all
The $ function not found error disappeared on refreshes.I have a doubt
regarding using ifixpng pluggin.I have a transparent png image as a
background for a table  <td>.This is defined as a part of a class in the css
file.I tried using ifixpng on that class name like this
(."classname").ifixpng(); it does not seem to work.Has any one worked on it
or anyother workaround for this IE menace.

 If they had just played around with the system, they
might have been able to figure out things by
themselves. It seems important to communicate to them
the importance of uninhibited curiousity :)

Message-ID: <543865.93685.qm@web54502.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi

I have been trying to connect two ubuntu 7.10 boxes
(multibooting xp and ubuntu) sharing one monitor
keyboard and mouse (without KVM switch) by installing 
vncserver. I followed the following steps.

1. Installed vncserver in one box (host)
2. Choose system-preferences-remote desktop and
enabled allow other users to view desktop and allow
other users control desktop. (I did't enable: Ask you
for confirmation and Require the userto enter
password)
Default boot option in grub for the host system is
ubuntu 7.10.

3. Shutdown the host system disconnected the monitor
and keyboard and mouse.
4. Connected the keyboard,monitor and mouse to remote
pc.
5. Connected the host and remote pcs through twisted
ethernet cable.
6. Switched on both the systems. Boot into the remote
PC (ethernet light is glowing in both the systems)

7. From the remote system terminal I typed the
command: vncviewer rd-desktop:0 (rd-desktop is the
host name)
I am getting the following message:

Unable to connect to host: connection refused (111)

I expected to get the display of the remote desktop
screen asking for the username and then password.

Should someone clarify what is wrong in the setup?
Whether it is first possible to get the remote desktop
screen in the absence of monitor?

Could anybody tell me if i need to book a seat or to intimate anybody to
attend the FossConf. I am really looking forward to attending the talks
scheduled to be held in the conference.
I gathered from one of the mails sent today which said "*tell your
friend to book his seat early".

Hi Soumya,

If you want to participate in fossconf as a delegate, you still need to
register as delegate in the website[1]. Though this might not be
strictly followed, this might be helpful in knowing how many and what
kind of people are attending the conference. Once you register as
delegate, your name will appear in this list[2] May be registered
delegate might be getting some goodies ;)

Sir,
     Please check it up
1.vnc server password.
2. Check it up encryption level of data transfer.
3. checkup the the default GUI level and host name
4. Use IP number instead of host name in VNC viewer

You can use testdisk. It uses the back up of the NTFS partition table to
reconstruct the original partition. Apart from the overwritten data(and the
corresponding files) I guess everything else should be intact.

Ahem... Apparently, I replied before reading Anoop's post... Sorry about
that. But fact remains testdisk saved my data twice and I'd bet on it for
data recovery. I guess it would be a good way to go.

Thanks for the tip and the links. I have not tried this yet. I will
download gparted live cd this weekend. I see Testdisk is also included
in that.

Hello,
  I have a doubt which i am unable to solve.It is about the File
Descriptors.In all the places that I have searched for the answer they have
specified only 3 file descriptors:-
0-->stdin
1-->stdout*
*2-->stderr

I opened vi editor in one tty and in other i went to /proc/<pid of vi>/fd
and saw 4 fd those were 0,1,2 and 3.. Iknow about 0,1,2 but I could not make
out the what does 3 stands for?? It was a link to the .swp file.. Is 3
descriptor for the Read file?? Where can I find 'good' info about file
descriptors?/

Thakns in advance..

for each file you open from inside a program, you get an fd.. 0, 1, 2
are the default ones that come when you start the program, even
without you opening any file.. the .swp file is a temp file used by vi
to record unsaved changes (i think, i don't use vi...)

(now that i see shakthi's reply as well...)

why 9? you could surely have more descriptors than that.. it's usually
a system-specific limit (a sysctl entry in linux)...

Yes, there is no limit. ulimit can change the entry values.

File Descriptor:
When a Unix/Linux program wants to use a file, it must first open that
file.  When it does so, Unix/Linux will associate a number with the file.
This number, which is used by the program when reading from and writing to
the file, is the file descriptor.

A file descriptor is nothing but a  data structure used by a program to get
a handle on a file, the most well know being 0,1,2 for standard in, standard
out, and standard error.

when you login the system ,system default creates  three  3  file descriptor
for you
   the are
        1.stdin 0
        2.stdout 1
        3.stderr   2
If you are C programmer ,you can close this default file descriptor in the
particular program  using  "close() system call".

ex:
      /*file name   p1.c*/
        #include<stdio.h>
       int main()
               {
                       int a;
                         close(0);
                         scanf("%d",&a);
                         printf("%d",a);
                  }
           compile this using
                   #gcc -Wall  p1.c
            run it
                    #./a.out
               it will print garbage value ,because in this program we
closed file descriptor 0 (stdin) using close() system call .So this program
can't get input from keyboard.
In the same way we will close the stdout,stderr.

After you login you open a file for r/w system may assign no 4  for this new
open file.

On Unix/Linux systems, there is a limit set in the kernel on how many open
file descriptors are allowed on the system.we can see it  by using

#cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
49053                                            (i am using ubuntu see your
distro)

On my ubuntu system 49053 open file descriptors are permitted. We are
unlikely to run out. If we wanted to change it, we'd do something like this:


root@mohan-desktop:~# echo "104853" > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
root@mohan-desktop:~# cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
104853


(Warning, change kernel parameters on the fly only with great caution and
good cause)

But how do we know how many file descriptors are being used?
 root@mohan-desktop:~# cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr
4608    211      104853
    |         |           |
  (1)      (2)       (3)


1.total allocated file descriptor(the number of file descriptor allocated
since boot)
2.total free allocated file descriptors
3.total file descriptor

We were restricted to only these 3 file descriptors (FD)?

No, any process can have up to 9 file descriptors, we have only 
discussed 3 thus far. By default though every terminal that is
created, is created with the above three file descriptors.

Thank you I think I got the answer.. I needed 4tty


tty 1:  vi Ambuj.txt
tty 2: proc/<pid of vim>/fd showed 1,2,3,4 FD`s


tty 3: vi Ambuj.txt
tty 4: proc/<pid of vim>/fd showed 1,2,3,4 FD`s

Close the vi in tty4

tty3: vi Ambuj*2*.txt
tty4: proc/<pid of vim>/fd showed 1,2,3,3 FD`s
The FDs were different?

Is the network working? For example, what do you get when you do "ping
rd-desktop" ?

Also, have you logged on to the remote PC? You'll have to logon using
GDM on the remote PC, only then you'll be able to vncview that
desktop.

I would suggest the following: Make sure you've got openssh-server
installed on the remote PC. Now from the client, do ssh rd-desktop
(assuming network is up).

Start a VNC server by "vncserver :1"

The first time you run this, it will ask you for a password.

Now from the client, connect to the remote PC, by "vncviewer rd-desktop:1"

Hi guys,

             I've been having a problem with Ubuntu on my laptop for some
months now. I`m unable to upload any file to any server from my laptop in
Ubuntu. I can upload via windows ( I have dual boot ) so it cant be a
problem with my internet connection or the servers i`m uploading to. I've
tried lots of forums to no avail. If I bring my laptop to the meet tomorrow,
will someone be kind enough to take a look at it and tell me what the
problem is?

This might be an issue with compiz. Try disabling compiz (i.e.

  You would need connectivity to the internet and if
you can ensure that maybe some one can help.

Right now, I cannot even submit any forms in Ubuntu. The uploaded content
doesn't have to be anything big. If 5 kb could be somehow successfully
uploaded, I`m guessing even 50mb can be too. The problem is not the file
size. Something else is wrong.

try with a live cd of some standard distro like mandriva, knoppix or  
even puppy to see if there is some linux compatibility problem

Problem occurs on live cd also. I've tried Mandriva and Open Suse. The same

Are you using any proxy? Gateway? Or is it a direct connection to the
internet? If so, also try using a direct connection.

Thanks! Using a direct connection worked. At least when i tested it now :)
Usually, I use a wireless router. Now connected directly to the modem, I`m
able to upload files. Any idea, what settings in my wireless configuration
I`d have to change to get it to work?

If it gets stuck, do you mean, that you cannot add /
edit / modify any text-fields that you (may) have
included within it ?

There are two possible causes. One, that was mentioned
earlier (compiz)

The second could be a fault in your code. If you can
"show the code", probably, we'll know where the fault
is.

Subject: [Ilugc] Python-Perl Memory models
Message-ID: <18633.90831.qm@web8408.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I am trying to evaluate the scalability and flexibility of Python and Perl - basically how the context switches and the loading of memory models happen when switching tech stacks. Has anyone done this before? Or can share any useful links?

I have tried a very limited version of passing C arguments to python modules and getting the results back in C, but this is a very very rudimentary implementation. I would be interested hearing some experiences along similar lines - the problems, solutions and tips/tricks.
 
Cheers,

As far as python is concerned, we have a first rate documentation
regarding the C/Python API. Maybe you were looking for this?
http://docs.python.org/api/memoryOverview.html

And Just curious, did you use PyCObjects? Its real fun..=)

I think we need to do some useful things to the Govt. Schools. The major
problem is the lack  Linux and FOSS knowledge among the faculties(or
teachers).

One time I had the opportunity to go to my school. Its also a Govt. Boys
Higher Sec. school. 30km west from vellore. The same Suse is also present.
But Its like a Horse sleeping all the time. If the teachers itself not
practiced in Linux, then how come the students?

This and all nothing, read the next...

We all know that previously 'C/C++' taught through 'Turbo C/C++' compiler.
one of the faculty asked me, "do you know how to make the getch() function
work in linux?". If anyone have the explenation, I salute to you.

set is a bash built-in which allows you to set various shell options. It also 
sets positional parameters. env deals with environment variables.

IMO, that is a wrong assumption. It is not the lack of knowledge, it
is the lack of *attitude* or *drive* or *initiative*  to help
themselves.

If you focus only on the faculty, you will end up like Kolhapur
(Maharashtra), were faculty after getting trained moved to the
Industry for better paying jobs.

Students _must_ have the *attitude* to learn for themselves, and for
their future. If they keep expecting others to train them, they will
never learn, and there will only be so-called "training institutes"
that just suck more money and give back s***.

Faculty _must_ have the *attitude* to learn, atleast for themselves.

College management _must_ have the *attitude* to keep themselves
"informed" about *education*, and how they can help the college
infrastructure.

If each one blames the other as an excuse, neither will they improve,
nor anything will change.

It sounds silly to classify a portion(major that is) of computer users as
beast!

I agree that EMACS is used by more users that Vim. I could re-collect having
read an article claiming the same. Do we have stats for these?

Its more of one's perception. http://www.io.com/~dierdorf/emacsvi.html
You guys agree with that?

Uday.
PS: I used to write these rhyming lines often earlier! Just wanted to
re-asses!

Perhaps I'm not qualified enough to reply to this, but hey, this is
expecting too much :)
Aren't we talking about a High school and not a college?

Well that just proves the point.It has brilliant support even for such *5
people languages*, let alone *5 million people languages*.  Emacs has
excellent support for even a complex grammar like haskell... and i do use
haskell.. and many others do. Just being blissfully unaware of it is not
advisable since the latest perl interpreter pugs is being written in
haskell.

http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/ is a good one. You just have to pay for

I studdied Haskell in Univ and am aware of its usage. Perhaps my lat 
email should have carried a :D at the end of it ( was intended to a pun )

anyway, i personally think emacs is a waste of time. If you end up in a 
situation where your editor has a larger knowledge footprint than the 
app you are working on - there are issues. I recommend people look at 
Scribes / TextMate / etext to see what / where modern day programming 
editors are heading.

Everything I say is my personal opinion, if you dont like it - too bad.

Depends on where you collect stats from. I can tell you, looking at 
CentOS package download stats, that Vim users outnumber the Emacs users 
by about 68:1

However, i guess its important to note here that my stats only reflect a 
very small percentage of overall downloads ( we dont have access to all 
logs from everywhere, there are more than 200 external mirrors ) - And 
the other main thing to note is that because its installed and is 
updated, does not mean someone on that machine is actually using it!

  Sadly most students from these schools dont even
have access to basic computer education and the only
oppurtunity for the same is going to waste because
there is no trained staff.
  A good idea could be to get staffs from all schools
in a district and conduct a workshop.
  And if we can find volunteers for the same(you can
count me as one), we can cover a fair number of
schools.

Regards,
Kamal

the last time I paid for software was about in 1993 when I shelled  
out 30K for pagemaker and 25K for coreldraw. I have just paid 40  
euros for textmate. Textmate is emacs on steroids.

Hello ,

Can any one help throw some light on the the get_fs() and set_fs() function
? I have seen this function in one of the device drivers and am interested
to know what this actually signifies

That's an interesting point.  Not sure I'd agree, but interesting nonetheless.
Emacs is huge, and that'll be an understatement, but do you really
think that it'll have a "large knowledge footprint"?  I mean while
working you're normally just using the small set of features that your
fingers "know".

Same here. I use vim for simple edits, usually over remote ssh
sessions. If I need to write a program or need to write text documents
(including my blog posts at times), or do edits over a longer period
of time, I use emacs. If the job is usually copy + paste, like making
notes, and then pasting them on email or IM etc, it is usually gedit. 

Also, when at home, I use Gnus as my mail reader (which runs under
emacs). So emacs is on most of the time. However when I use mutt, I
prefer to use Vim, since I dont like using emacs client and keep
switching windows. Also, I use Planner under emacs for keeping track
of my tasks.

Again, I am not a emacs fanatic. Just prefer the right tool for the
right job.

Since you are using a standalone desktop system, i dont think you will
need exim. But i dont there was any problem. I have seen exim take a
long time to load. Probably you can install rcconf and remove exim4
from the startup list.

Message-ID: <683a0f200801130954u6074d40ah2da0fc06832b99a6@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All !

As i have just migrated from ubuntu to debian, i want help for
installing bluetooth file shaing in deb etch.

i could not fine gnome-bluetooth-0.9.0 as deb file, so i downloaded the
source files and while configuring i get the following error.

checking for GNOME_BLUETOOTH... configure: error: Package requirements (
libglade-2.0 gobject-2.0 libgnomeui-2.0 >= 1.110.0 gconf-2.0 libbtctl >=
0.8.0 gconf-2.0 >= 2.3.3 gtk+-2.0 >= 2.10) were not met:

No package 'libglade-2.0' found
No package 'libgnomeui-2.0' found
No package 'gconf-2.0' found
No package 'libbtctl' found
No package 'gconf-2.0' found
No package 'gtk+-2.0' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables GNOME_BLUETOOTH_CFLAGS
and GNOME_BLUETOOTH_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

As it suggests i guess i have to modify some env vars bcause i got all the
lib it says not found !

While migrating from Ubuntu, try Debian Testing (Lenny) first, as the
versions of software match better. I am assuming that this is not for server
use.

GNOME Bluetooth is available in Lenny

1. Upgrade to Lenny (not difficult) by changing your APT sources
<http://research.iiit.ac.in/~masatran/debian/apt-testing>, OR

2. Use the command-line tools that are in Etch.

Please document the process your printer took to keep it 100% FOSS.  We 
could show it to our respective print houses across the country and 
show them it can be done.

I had to convert artwork to Corel format for the printer to work with it 
for my company letter heads, biz cards etc.

Thanks.

You need to "sudo aptitude update" whenever you modify the sources. You need
to do this in Ubuntu too, but you don't know this probably because you have
been using the graphical interface.

I work 2 to 3 days a week in an environment dominated by sysadmin 
developers. They are essentially sysadmin and infrastructure people - 
but all of them have a development background, ranging from linux kernel 
driver development to ataoe driver implementation. A large majority of 
them there use Emacs, and love it. And I am not doubting they are very 
highly productive as well.

The thing is, I get more done, in the same amount of time, just using 
native tools, *most* of the time. eg. a svn status within emacs will 
take upto 45 to 55 seconds to get done, whereas on the same machine 
using 'svn st' on the cli will return in under 6 seconds. So basically 
using Screen and Vim, I can do pretty much everything they do on Emacs - 
only I get there first :D.

the one thing that is nice in Emacs is the shell buffer, which is 
completely missing in Vim. I have seen and heard of the vim-shell patch, 
however, I think for now Screen gives me that sort of flexibility 
without needing to learn a gazzilion keystrokes. Besides, once you get 
the hang of Vim, editing speeds are much higher than Emacs anyway! 
</opinion>

I honestly, think that for people who spend their lives in an Editor and 
need the whole world to be focused around an Editor ( developers and 
debuggers ) - Emacs is hard to beat. Some might argue Eclipse is close 
behind, followed by the Kdevelop + Kate bundle. For everyone else, I 
think the editor markets are elsewhere.

My friend is doing his MCA in Vellore Institute of Technology. He is in his
final year. Now he needs to do a project for his final semester. I told him
to do his project in FOSS. Is there any chance for him to do his projects in
FOSS ? If so whom do we need to contact ? He also asked me about the
certifications. Will FOSS give certifications for the projects? And will
those certificates be accepted by the people in the colleges?

I like emacs - my only problem is finding files and switching between  
files. Other editors have a nice file-list on the left hand side. If  
emacs had this feature, I would use it

we gave him the png output and he used it directly - although the  
color separation must have been done in proprietary software. For the  
brochure neither scribus nor open office could produce pdf/jpg of  
sufficient quality. So we gave it in OO format which he cut and  
pasted into pagemaker and printed it.

Dired is amazing.
Search/Replace on a set of files spread over multiple directories using 
regexp is a killer feature.
And it has hooks for a variety of purposes, vc-directory and image-dired 
are two examples.

C-x C-b (list-buffers) will open a list of open buffers.  You can use
'n' and 'p' to move up and down that list ... 'o' will show the chosen
buffer in the other window.

Or you can use speedbar (M-x speedbar) or dired (C-x d) if you want to
open lots of new files instead of switching between open files.  The
dired key-chords are the same as the ones in list-buffers.

But then, the fastest way is to use "C-x b" and switch between buffers
you are working on.  Or you could use "C-x 5 b" to open a new frame
(what you'd call a GUI window) and then "Alt-Tab" between them.

It does seem silly to avoid Emacs just because you can't switch
between open files.  Emacs is meant to be used on many files, unlike
certain other vile editors.  Use "emacsclient" to open new files from
the command line, so you won't have to go with another editor for
quick hacks on files.

If it all gets too heavy and you're feeling down, you can "M-x doctor"
to have a word with the resident psychotherapist ... hth. :)

What you need is probably ECB (http://ecb.sourceforge.net/)

I personally use a combination of bubble buffer, recentf and ido

My ~/.emacs is available at http://prashblog.com/files/.emacs in case
you are interested. I initially started modelling this from
baishampayan's .emacs and then added a few functions from various

hi,

we need to accommodate delegates and speakers. So lets show the  
traditional chennai hospitality - add your names here:
http://registration.fossconf.in/code/wiki/BedandBreakfast

all you need to do is to house the delegate/speaker, feed him/her/it  
and produce the same at the conference.

Have you tried to use Eclipse? Just try it once. It works only on
Project structures. Can't be used on individual files on different
locations though.

Pros: Syntax highlighting, auto-complete and compile as you type for
many languages + XML, XSL, XSD, WSDL, etc... Find and replace at
various levels (File, folder, project, referenced project, all
projects, ... ), finds references, etc...

Cons: Its quite heavy. It does not do a good job if the file sizes and
number of files go out of hand :D

PS: Eclipse is opensource. If you are worried that Java isn't
completely opensource (as yet), There is a version that has been
compiled with GCJ into native Linux platform too :-)

I tried it once - hate java apps. Too heavy. The only java app I use  
is freemind. I am perfectly content with eric3/quanta on linux. It is  
for mac that I wavering between textmate and emacs

        There is insufficient data t diagnose the problem. What were the
 contents of /var/log/Xorg.log?  What was displayed on the console?  Did
 you try running gdm/zdm/kdm/wdm by hand? did it fail?  What graphics
 card do you have? Were you using a non-free video griver, and perhaps
 needed a newer version for the new kerel that got installed with the
 upgrade?

        Lacking details like that, it is very hard to help you find out
 what went wrong, and to help  you correctly upgrade to Lenny.

Hello !

u r exactly right.

i am doing my final year project using BlueZ stack of Linux
to implement IEEE paper.

what i wanted was good looking gnome-bluetooth :)
but happy with CLI now, i would use that for receiving files and openobex
lib to pus files.

truth is i am not good at debugging and i lost 3 days upgrading.

i will definitely learn how to solve later, as time is critical.

Thanks a lot.

List of all repositories or branches/directories in a repository? If
latter, you are looking for 'svn ls' command.

ex: svn ls http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn

repositories are set up outside svn - they can be anywhere on the  
file system - only the sysadmin will know where he set them up. So  
you have to use general search tools to find all the repositories.  
For example I have most of my repositories on a server under / 
Subversion/public - so I can get that list. There are also many  
private repositories under various home directories. How can  
subversion know where these are?

Hi,

If you access svn via APACHE.

You can use the directive 'SVNListParentPath' to list all repositories via direct http request.

Dept of CSE: Seminar Announcement
-----------------------------------

Title:

        Lessons Learned From The Internet Project

Speaker:

        Dr. Douglas Comer
        Cisco Systems, VP of Research Collaboration
        Purdue University (on leave)

Date/Time: January 18, 2008, 3 - 4pm in BSB 361 (Seminar Room)

Abstract:

      The Internet ranks among the greatest achievements of
    20th century Computer Science.  The basic technology was so
    well conceived that it has remained virtually unchanged
    despite completely new applications and dramatic growth in the
    number of connected computers and traffic.  This eclectic
    talk presents a series of lessons drawn from the Internet
    experience that may help us better understand how to proceed
    with new research.  It considers the design of protocols,
    general principles, technologies, the underlying architecture,
    the effect of economics on networking research, and ways
    that experimental research projects can be organized to
    ensure success.  

Speaker Bio:

    Douglas Comer is VP of Research Collaboration at Cisco systems,
    and Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at Purdue
    University, where he has spent 30 years and is currently on an
    extended leave. He received his PhD in Computer Science from
    Pennsylvania State University in 1976.

    An internationally recognized expert on computer networking, Comer
    has been involved in Internet research since the late 1970s. His
    series of ground-breaking textbooks have been translated into 16
    languages, and are used by professional engineers and students
    around the world.  For twenty years, Comer was editor-in-chief of
    the journal Software -- Practice And Experience.  He is a Fellow
    of the ACM.

  It is not the same spec for both linux and windows
laptops, check out the HCL website for more details.

Where does it say the same laptop (same config, feature) with Windows
cost 34,000?

The MiLeap  X

-  a 7-inch LCD screen,
-  2 GB of solid state internal storage,
-  512 MB of memory
- Intel Celeron mobile
- The operating system is an Ubuntu flavour of Linux, though users are
free to port a Windows version if they choose, adding an external hard
drive through the USB port.
- CD/DVD drive has been dispensed with to achieve the low selling
price of Rs 13,999.


quote

The MiLeap Y Series uses a faster Intel processor, doubles the memory
and adds an 80 GB hard drive ? the type sported by hand-held devices
like iPods.

This allows the makers to preload Windows Vista Home Premium edition
and throw in a Web cam. The 7-inch screen is touch sensitive ? which
allows the machine to be used like a tablet PC.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0801171036150.32250-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

Dear All,

Already I mailed[1] to list, about the need of ILUGC volunteers to
setup a small computer center with Ubuntu Distro at UCH[2]. But due to
some problem in getting the computer for that center, that task was
suspended. Now with help of few donors, UCH arranged 12 computers and
they are planning to open this computer center on Tue 22nd Jan 2008.

Last week, I visited the UCH and installed Ubuntu 6.x in 2 computers,
just to check the hardware compatibility issues. No major issue. This
weekend, again I am going to UCH to help in installations.

Most of computers are low end system with CD Driver. So following 
things are needed to speedup setup process:

1. 3 Set latest Ubuntu DVDs
2. 3 DVD Readers
3. 2 or 3 power extn boxes

I don't have any experience in setting the local repo using Ubuntu.  
So there is a need for Ubuntu volunteer(s).

UCH is in kadappakkam. It is around 2Hrs travel from Chennai on ECR.
Lunch will be arranged at UCH.

Anybody willing help in this task, Plz mail to ME. NOT to the list.

About UCH[2]:

The Uluru Children's Home cares for a particularly vulnerable group of
girls. Since 2003, the Home has housed about 30, mainly rural girls
who have been orphaned or abandoned by destitute parents. e-Centre
facility will cater to the ongoing, long-term educational needs of the
children based at UCH and will be accessible to children and adults
from surrounding villages.

First of all FOSS is not an entity, it is an acronym for Free Open 
Source Software.

There are many FOSS projects that need help (freshmeat.net, 
sourceforge.net).  Your friend needs to decide first what *he would 
like to do* *what makes him tick*, then pick a project in the area of 
his interest and go with it.

He should not wait for (or expect) someone to tell him what to pick/do.

Message-ID: <3d6b99b1-8d1f-4c3f-b0cb-8d7723bf00cd@i72g2000hsd.googlegroups.com>

Dear All
Based on the registration of the delegates I have taken a rough
estimate of number of delegate from different locations.

Place					No of Delegate
Bangalore, Hosur			17 + 1

Mumbai, Pune				6 + 1

New Delhi				2

Coimbatore, Erode, Sathyamangalam	1 + 2

Hyderabad				3

Madurai,karaikudi			3 + 2

Vellore , Chitoor			1 + 2

Panruti, Neyveli			1 + 1

Nellore					1

Gurgaon					1

Gunupur					1

Durgapur				1

These are all the number of delegates coming from different locations.
We can think arranging transport from specific points and at specific
timings like at Chennai Central, Koyembedu bus stop, and Chennai
Egmore; between 10.30hrs to 11.00hrs

Your suggestions please

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0801181048530.2561-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

> Graphics into the kernel?

Whether or not the graphics subsystem is part of the operating
system's kernel or not is highly controversial, and popular opinion
seems to change over time. For example, a certain other major OS has
had graphics in, and then out of, the kernel several times now.

> Sudo Voodoo

Using the root account for day-to-day work is a bad idea. It's better
to use sudo to act like root when you need to do a little system
administration. Ken Hess shows you how.

> Boxes and Bugs

What can we learn from the ants and bees? Perhaps something we can
take something from the ants that may be helpful for clustering. If
nodes were cheap and plentiful, then who cares? It would be kind of
like stepping on ants: there always seem to be more.

I booted the live CD and installed it on a dispensable partition.  Each 
time I logged into the Gnome desktop I got an error message from the 
window manager - note this was on the stock install by the Mint 
installer.  After the error message, the eye candy window decoration is 
replaced with the a Motif look alike widgets.

Considering Ubuntu 7.10 Gnome/KDE work fine on the same system, this was 
a bit of a disappointment.  The eye candy on the Live CD is good 
though.

Attention:Its incomplete,may not be exactly what the speaker spoke !
Speaker is not responsible for any of the mistake that may be present here.
Its just how i understood about the talk :)

Its for every1 who missed the talk today.
Friends it was not so techy but it was simple short n sweet talk.
Google for the keywords and u will be find the reliable source.
Every sub topic had a "lesson learned" inference.


Lessons Learned From The Internet
Douglas E Comer

Architecture
   Structure:Network vs Internet
        former means single large network  and later is network of network.
        pros and cons of these structures.

   Interconnection:Application vs Packets
       gatewaying not possible for each service or application
       so we go for routers, which work at packet level

   Vareity of underlying networks
       different types of DLL protocols have to be taken care of.

Technology
   virtual system
      packet->ip
      coaxial cable->hub->switch
      switch->VLAN switch -> Layer 3 Switch
      router->virtual router
      or simply an abstraction is required for providing a simple interface

   Sending bits rapidly
      ranging slowest possible speed to 40Gbps

Economics

   Effect of commercialization

   Peering arrangements
       Internet routing not based on shortest path.

   Cost of packets vs circuits

   Making money in networking

   Economics and QoS

Protocols
   Power of IP
     simple elegant ... and thats why it has triumphed as a winner

   Achieving Reliable Transfer
     X.25 is poor. retransmission happens at 2 layers which are no in sync
(google it)
     retransmission should be end to end

   Future of LAN protocols

   Aggressive retransmission
      i guess he could have meant fast retransmit...not sure
      congestion is a factor too

   Internet Address Model
      end to endness but now bcas of nat it isnt true.
      so a lesson learned

Layering
   Design of protocol layering
      clearly specifiying which layer does what.
      lesson learned is since it was properly done TCP/IP rules
      and works over any underlying n/w

   Permutation of layers
      he was questioning why PPPoE should exist, because PPP is meant for
point to point
      whereas IP is multicast based
      similarly VPN,iSCSi(he simply mocked taking MS booting over iSCSI and
      laughter followed),EoIP,TDMoIP,IP over IP

Conducting Research
   NSFNET vs DARPA

   OSI vs TCP/IP

Unresolved Problem
   Understanding Internet
      like how it works.
      traffic behavior should be observed not just taking a tiny topology
      but a real time one.
      should not be optimized but should look at tradeoff.
      managing the internet- n/w management node to topological level.
      Fiber in the internet- how to use switched lambda in packet switching.
      routing in internet.
      route flopping and black holes - must google ! as its still unresolved


Internet by-products
     Digi Cam, VoIP, Video services
     basically anything that evolved bcas of internet boom

Message-ID: <7bf1bec50801182108t6f8b42a3v108dda5b782684f0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Am unable to input capital C in emacs under ruby mode! When I try I get 'C-'
displayed in the minibuffer. I guess that means pressing Shift+c mimics
pressing the Ctrl key!! It works alright in other modes though. Anyone
facing this problem? Am using Emacs 22.1.1 installed from Ubuntu (Gutsy)
repositories. I also have ruby-mode.el, inf-ruby.el, find-recursive.el,
snippet.el, ruby-electric.el and the emacs-rails package installed.

thanks,
mano

The folks who printed the posters since I thought they did  using foss 
tools. But after reading your explanation, I dont think so. Its just

OOh dang, are they.. I have given a set of posters to my friends (a sort
of network really) to be stuck in their institution's notice board. If
its already there in their boards, I might get pounded really hard =).

So to clarify, Did you mean "Posters and brochures _are_ being
couriered"? or did you mean you want volunteers to distribute them? Of
course I do understand that we will have to courier them for colleges
outside Chennai and adjoining districts.

Please standby, I will ping back with the list of the colleges that has
the posters once I get confirmation, so as to avoid duplication of work.
Apologies though, I should have done this earlier.

afaik there is no foss tool for colour separation for print quality -  
colour separation means producing 4 positives/negatives on film for  
the 4 colours - cyan, magenta, yellow and black. These four colours  
are then printed on the paper to get a multicolour printout.

Well NRCFOSS sends it officially and you give it 'friendly'.
Nothing wrong in more than one poster reaching a college.

It is not duplication - it is intensive marketing.

You could request for one from www.zyxware.com/requestcd. It might
take a couple of days to reach you though.

I will send you one Ubuntu 7.10 Live DVD (32bit) and 4 Ubuntu 7.10
alternate install CDs (32bit) by mail tomorrow itself. The alternate
install cd is the fastest way to install Ubuntu. You can use the DVD
to populate a local package repository. If you have any alternative
thoughts about this do let me know before I send them. I will send
them via the RequestCD program that we are running at
Zyxware(http://www.zyxware.com/requestcd) but free of cost.

It is really nice to see
1) efforts like UCH and
2) efforts of ilug volunteers like you
3) impact of FLOSS in social development
Kudos for all three. Wishing all the very best to all the efforts.

Also regarding ubuntu you can set up apt-cacher and then use a local
repository to run all your updates. You can see a post on this at

Hi All,

Myself, Selvaraj and Naren are went to UCH on Sunday 11AM and
installed 8 machines with Edubuntu. And helped them to setup the
computer center. 

We went with 2 DVD drives and installed new Ubuntu 7.10 from the DVD .
After installation only, we came to know that, it doesn't have any
games like gcomprise, childplay...

So we tried to install games from the Debian DVDs and Edubendu 6.2.  
But nothing worked. Next from Internet using Tata Indicom USB Modem.  
But speed was very very less. So that idea also dropped.

Finally we installed all machines with old Edubundu 6.2 CD.

UCH is having lot of *USEFUL* educational VCDs(?) from APF[1]. But all
runs only on Windoz with flash player. Recently I saw a flash player
on Mandriva. Did anyone tried to run such VCD(?) with that player??

Thanks to Amachu for the new Ubuntu DVD and Thanks to MaSiva for
helping to setup the Tata Indicom USB modem using wvdial.

Bye :)

I use emacs 23 http://ppa.launchpad.net/avassalotti/ubuntu and I am able

There is a difference between desktop environments and window managers.
Gnome, KDE, XFCE are desktop environments and fluxbox, openbox, blackbox 
etc. are window managers.

If you are willing to manage your desktop yourself, you can give the WMs 
a shot. I use fluxbox and it serves my needs perfectly.
If you want a full fledged distribution based on fluxbox, check out 
Fluxbuntu.

Hey!

I have created a protocol plugin for RediffBol for Pidgin/libpurple.
But as a programmer its sad to see that my code is not being used
(incl. by myself :) ) since hardly anybody uses rediffbol for
chatting. Anyways, if anybody thinks it'll be useful then great :) Its
an HTTP based plugin, and needless to say its not suitable for
production use!

There is libggi but haven't used it.

You will especially need to take a look at LibGII, for drawing
primitives like lines, circles etc.

And yes, you can convince your buddies to program X, if they are game
for it.

There is a subtle difference between Desktop and Window Manager.  A 
desktop includes a bunch of applications besides the window manager ala 
KDE/GNOME/XFCE.

This link http://xwinman.org/ shows the various Desktops and Window 
Managers.

You can get all Win Managers/Desktops with any distro on your hard disk 
install.  Simply choose session type when you login.

Assuming, there's still a lot of *dos* based
(practicals in lab) and lack of knowledge about other
C compilers, TurboC++3.0 continues to haunt colleges.
TurboC++3.0 is *meant* for DOS, not WinDOWS. Enough of
rant, back to topic.

> we need them for graphics lab !

There are two of them (listed below)

One was suggested by Pradeepto, long time ago, named
Allegro ( http://www.allegro.cc/ ) when I had put this
query in GLUG-BOM. Thanks to him. :) 
There are packages available for allegro under *buntu.
I assume, downloading and installing them isn't
difficult. 
The advantage of allegro is that it is cross-platform.
So you could compile the library for Windows too, and
programs can be easily ported. :) (Oops, that reminds
me of something else too)

However, allegro is technically a game programming
library and may be too much for primitive graphics. 

SECOND, is a very simple, low-level library, similar
to graphics.h in TC++3.0 is SVGALib. I have written an
introductory tutorial, for one to get started with
that library under *buntu. Here's the link to it:

http://db.glug-bom.org/wiki/index.php/Trivial_Graphics_Programming_with_GCC_and_Svgalib

Hope, you'll find at-least one useful.

        No.  The free in free software has to do with freedom, not with
 cost.  You are at liberty to try and see free software, like Debian, at
 whatever price point you choose.

I do remember a couple of people asking if there was anyway to support

You need to be more specific with your query.
Verbosity required.

However, assuming, you need to transfer files between
*buntu Linux on your desktop and WIndows XP on your
laptop, you'll need the following (overview).

1. Samba packages (apt-cache search samba*)
2. A shared folder on Windows XP machine (one that has
write permission enabled, if under NTFS) - probably,
disabling the default firewall of Windows XP on the
network connection used for this transfer.
3. Your Broadband router with the USB cable and
ethernet cable connected to LAPTOP and desktop
respectively. 

Later, assign them IPs of 192.168.x.x range setting
the broadband router's IP as the gateway for both the
PCs. 

Open Konqueror (if in KDE; better actually ;) ) and
type
smb://<IP_ADDRESS_OF_LAPTOP>/shared_folder_name

You should be able to see the shared folder on the
laptop and be able to copy and paste files using the
GUI. :)

All,

Our current interviews features a Chennai-ite, works mostly on 
translation for projects such as KDE-Tamil, Ubuntu-Tamil. He's famously 
known by his IRC nick amachu and if there's something in Tamizh (as 
actually pronounced in Tamil), amachu is likely associated with it. 
Read on, to know more about Tamizh, translation and amachu.

Hello ALL !

VECFOSS is involved in FOSS awareness in Velammal.
I am meeting a lot of staff, Head of department of CSE & IT have given their
good support.
We are planning for full fledged FOSS Lab, running Debian Etch.
There is a good word of mouth abt FOSS, due to aggressive promotion.
Once seniors are back to college still more people will be up the in group.

I have given introductory talk to 3rd yr IT and would be doing the same for
CSE too.
An amount was collected after the talk from the students for the CD medium
for distributing Ubuntu Gutsy.
we have setup a public wiki with few topics like purpose, agenda,intro etc
wiki was suggested by one of the FOSS enthusiast from MECH, to introduce the
concept of
contributing.There were few FOSS enthusiast whom were identified because of
VECFOSS.

vecfoss.pbwiki.com

Posters are all up at several places at the campus.
Guess minimum of 50 people will turn up for the conference on Feb 2 n 3 as
Feb 1 is working.

Its my pleasure to invite as many Guest Lectures possible on FOSS at my
college.

It would not been possible without the wonderful moral support from
Mr.Kumaran HOD CSE JEC
Mr P.Raman Lynus Academy
Mr.Thyagu
Mr.Bharathi
Mr.Koushik - My beloved senior, who introduced me to FOSS
Mr.Rajasekar - Friend from ILUGC
NRCFOSS members
and u ILUGC members.

pls suggest more for improvement :)

To copy files between Linux desktop and your XP desktop, without going 
through the hassles of configuring samba.

1. Download WinSCP on your Win XP box
2. Install WinSCP on WinXP
3. Enable sshd on Linux box
4. From WinXP connect to your Linux box using WinSCP.
5. xfre/sync files between Linux and XP box to your hearts content.

Linux to Linux plenty of solutions - scp, rsync (over ssh), unison.

When I have to share some files within an intranet I just run the webserver
that comes in a rails app (which I have specifically created for such misc
work) with the file to be shared in the public directory and mail the url to
people I want to share it with. So, it doesn't matter if the other machine
is linux, windows, osx ....

Just as a matter of interest, I was wondering why Ubuntu was chosen for 
this specific case ? Is it just a case wherein the people doing this 
stuff are most familiar with Ubuntu ?

UCH got the 1st computer from AUS on 2006 with Ubuntu. So they are
some what familiar with it. No other specific reason.

How Consolidation Affects Open Source

So, now that the dust is starting to settle from the news that Sun is
buying MySQL for a staggering $1 billion pricetag, let's take a look
at the larger picture-- how is consolidation going to affect the open
source ecosystem? MySQL was the first project in 2008 to be absorbed
this way, but it certainly won't be the last.

Hello List,

A social movement wants to build a dynamic website with the following
features :

1. The site designing will be done once and will remain the same for
quiet some time;
Further on, there will be a lot of content added/modified on regular
basis and the need is for any of their members to be able to do it
(like, I think it happens with the CMS like Joomla, Drupal among
others);

2. Polling on various issues, Creation of electronic Newsletters to be
emailed to subscribers, based on information existing on the site;

3. Separate areas for separate levels of visitors;

4. Discussion forum;

5. Search through the site for terms, words;

6. Adding links of other sites similar to theirs;

7. Giving links to various issues and grouping them under issues
(subjects);

perhaps there can be many more things through which they can link their
activities happening across the country and they are working on these.
they would like to have a site that will give room for adding more
features as they develop the web-based way of working further.

One main concern is that if the management of such a site needs a
technical specialist, it will be a problem. They want to train some of
their members form a team, learn this and manage the site.

Yours suggestions from your experience will help enrich their work.
Thanks a lot.

With best wishes for Unity in thinking, feeling and action.

Message-ID: <69621d830801250241i3688d401s37ce05ca18f343a@mail.gmail.com>

I am facing an annoying problem now. I got some CCNA slides which are in exe
format and which runs under internet browser. Obviously they use flash.
Now, i have been trying to run that exe program with wine. It installed and
runs in my Firefox broswer; but it don`t open there. I mean, the only "
index.html" file opens but, when i clicks to open other files like "Ch:1" or
"Ch:2"...then nothing happens.
What should i do? Please help me. I don`t want to use windows with this
silly matter.

The complete picture is this:

1. File name: "Exploration1.exe"
2. When i clicks on that "Exploration1.exe" file; it installed under wine
3. After that, when i again click on the "Exploration1.exe" file, it`s "
index.html" file opens under Firefox but nothing else....when i click on
some "links" there like "Chapter 1" or "Chapter 2" ... then nothing happens.

Waiting for your answer.

By fault it has existing with DOS OS. We tried to boot it from our

Mini-itx board wont support DOM module. Anyone help me, how can solve this

Can you post your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file ?
Also, post the o/p of the following commands:

$ xrandr
$ glxinfo  | grep -i "direct rendering"

A Field Guide to Free Software Supporters

Hearing the terms "free software" or "open source," you might imagine
that they referred to a single school of thought. Even "free and open
source software" (FOSS) suggests only two different outlooks: Free
software, which values political and philosophical freedom, and open
source, whose main interest is enhanced software quality.

Full story http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/12068_3723131_1

An interesting analysis of different schools of thought.

If you have trouble finding it in Chennai, then try Computer Book Shop.
http://www.cb-india.com/  They are a subsidiary of Shroff Publishers and 
IIRC they have Indian reprint rights for several publishers including 
Apress, O'Reilly etc.

Did the install configure your /etc/X11/xorg.conf with the Intel drivers 
for the GPU?  If so, simply change the resolution line to 1200x800 
(assuming you have a wide display format).

Did you try to configure X after you finished installing OpenSuse ?
They have a tool for that - I think it is sax2 or something.
Try bumping up the resolution using that configuration tool.

Mine`s vaio. I configured mine`s under Ubuntu 7.10. Now it`s running
1280x800 with 60Hz. I had to change my xorg.conf too.

First of all install the 965resolution for intel graphics chip. Then go to
single user mode and change your screen resolution.
I have added a *bolded *line in your xorg.conf

Subject: [Ilugc] [JOB] Open source weather visualization
Message-ID: <479C60E1.7030004@aero.iitb.ac.in>

Hello,

One project position is open at the Department of Aerospace Engineering,
IIT Bombay for the visualization of weather data using open source
tools. The project will involve creating tools for the visualization of
atmospheric weather data using Mayavi.  Mayavi is an open source,
interactive, 3D visualization tool written in Python. More information
on Mayavi is available:

  https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/wiki/MayaVi

In addition to directly working with Mayavi and its core development
team, the project will require working with and contributing to
several important open source projects like VTK (http://www.vtk.org),
Python (http://www.python.org), Traits and the Envisage application
framework (http://code.enthought.com).

Mayavi2 is packaged as part of Debian (testing) and many people all over 
the world are using it.  Mayavi2 was also featured on the front page of 
the Python Magazine in December

  http://pymag.phparch.com/c/issue/view/61


Requirements
-------------

  * knowledge of C and object oriented programming with C++.
  * passion for 3D graphics, visualization, software engineering and
    technology.
  * passion for open source software.
  * knowledge of Python is a plus.

You will need to work at IIT Bombay.  If you are from outside Mumbai 
accommodation will be provided on campus.  Local Mumbai residents can 
choose to stay at home.

The project ends in April 2009. The pay will be reasonable but depends 
on how good you are.  It might not match industry rates, but you will be 
on the IITB campus.  More details on the project are available here:

  http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/~prabhu/Projects

Please do get back to me if you are interested.  Please also circulate 
this to anyone who you think may be interested.

Thanks!

Regards,

I feel, we are thinking from our perspective, instead of the end user
perspective.

We are so used to Linux, FOSS, etc, that we use many technical words
casually..

But how about the mindset of those students/ teachers..

Telling that they should have the attitude is pretty easy..  But that
attitude when not provided with suitable source of knowledge, will
extinguish..

I will just give an example..  My sister is in her final year CS .. she
called me for some project for display in her college education.

I told her, to go for OSS..  you wont believe..  she asked me the most basic
elementary questions of FOSS..
some are below.

What is OSS?

What is FOSS?

I told her to first google these words, and then call me..  the next day,
she called me, and just told what is there in the site..

I was wondering, what is the difference b/w knowing and understanding..
they know what is FOSS..  but did she understood it?

I spend one hour over the phone explaining what is open source etc..

So, when even a final year college student is like that, how about a typical
government school student?

I strongly believe, we need to get down to the most basic level to spread
OSS & FOSS..

Regards,
Senthil Raja

Joomla is best, in terms of managing the site..

Drupal is extensive, but administering it is difficult.

Yes..  Amachu alias ramdas is one of the staunch believer of Technology @
mother tongue..

I know him right before he joined NRC..  he is passionate, and core to his
belief, he follows it.

All his mails would be in tamil..  Initially i felt it as somewhat
inconvenient, but, later realised, that just wishful thinking is not enough
for bringing our wish..

We are so trained in English right from our LKG, such that, anything in our
mother tongue is alien..

I tried replying in tamil for few of his mails, and realised, that it needs
great effort to bring in to habit..  (ofcourse, we go by our habits.. if we
want to bring any change, make it as a habit)

Now i am aspiring to develop a software, with all related documents,
(requirements, design) in Tamil.. :) .. its all because of him

Slightly, off the topic..  we should target to remove Turbo C++ from the
school syllabus, and promote foss alternative...

When i learned turbo C in my college, i am not even able to use it in Visual
C++ of windows.

Probably, we could speak to Umashankar of Elcot, who is one of the staunch
FLOSS enthusiasts..

The best answer could be as below... (please correct me if i am wrong).

FOSS software need not always be free.. however, when we buy that software,
we get the source code too, and the permission for us to share this software
with others.

You could typically explain this by comparing microsoft.. when you buy a
windows Xp cd, you have so much restriction.. ie, to use it only in one
machine, for only one user..  so you are like slave, who have to bound by
what ever they say..  you cant even install it another machine of yours, as
per their license.  (Many dont know this india thanks to piracy.. )

However, in FOSS, its exactly the opposite..

Why FOSS is free of cost?
  Because, those who initiated the project, need resources to do
programming.  They release it for free, under GPL license, because, when any
one uses this software, they have to give back the source of any
modifications / improvements they have done to it.  Thus, the originator of
the software gets benefitted in getting a better version of his own.
But in FOSS, since all participate in equal enthusiasm and commitment, every
one comes forward not just to share the modifications, but rather to
participate in improving the software.
Example...  oscommerce was the most popular ecommerce software.  Initially
it began with set of basic features.  But, as more and more people deploy it
for ecommerce sites, they are met with some custom requirements, which they
did to that basic version.  This change was again given back to the
developer community, and they incorporated.  When thousands of such people
participate, you can imagine the amount of innovation and improvement that
core developers got back.

(Unlike in India, in western countries, one can easily sue in court, and get
judgement quickly.. hence, most people adhere to the agreements :) )



Should all projects be free?
No.. not necessary..  if you have developed a s/w from scratch, you are
entitled to released it any license, like GPL, LGPL, or create your own
license..
However, if you build upon existing software, then you have to bind to the
license agreement.  Since most foss softwares are based on GPL, it requires
you NOT to charge for the software and you need to abide by it.  (if i am
wrong, any one please correct me)

Dinesh ..  you can convey the FOSS concept easily, by describing how we are
bound to microsoft and Linux..

Senthil Raja

Why cant this be a FOSS project?  Every year, there are lot of ME students,
who mostly do projects on Image Processing (fancy topic or fascinating topic
:) ) ..  these resources can be leveraged efficiently..

But, the problem is who is going to lead..

i feel, this is not a core problem..   rather, the requirement is not
conveyed to the corresponding project seeking students..

In this case, since kenneth directly faced this problem, he can better
describe the requirement, and can pinpoint, which part of the process we
need to do project on.. (in this case, the color separation, which the ME
students can definitely do over 6 months period).

And since this solves a real time business problem, it can be better
marketed at his college..  or rather, that student can do it for any
specific printers in business now..

Just my few cents..

Senthil Raja

basically requires reverse engineering platesetters - but as Niyam  
has mentioned, platesetters would accept pdf files. Which means that  
the software has to develop pdf files of sufficient quality.

in fact, your slides are datestamped 29-1-2008 at around 7.30 in the  
morning - so the version is correct.

I am involved with a project in IIT-Madras, where we are looking for
a group of vibrant people who can get involved in a project that
requires good python coding skills preferably python on web application
framework like Turbogears and
knowledge of web technologies like Ajax, XML, RSS and a of mix with mobile
technologies.


As of now, we are a small team of young professionals. This project will be
spun-off as a start-up very soon and
already there are a lot of big companies backing this up.

Imagine working in an informal environment with a team thats led by
innovation.

If this is something that interests you, write to : vppriya@tenet.res.in

Do not know how but my /etc/mtab permissions have changed due to which

while mounting it gives an error saying /etc/mtab permission denied. 
This is not my primary partition but has data in it.

Unable to list or even see its contents.

Any pointers?

Been using it for a long time now. Its fine. But I don't think a topic
like Django Vs TG can start off a flame war. Or can it?

no flame war intended - but tg is not suited for anything that you  
want to scale. Just check out the sites running django and compare  
them to the sites running tg.

There are commercial email to sms gateway providers who does this for 
you. I heard from my company admin that they promise delivery within 5 
minutes.

Btw, i still prefer pagers because it works for sure within the area. 
Cellphone runs into n/w coverage issues.

As root user, what does "ls -l /etc/mtab" show?  If you cannot mount and 
fix perms as root user then your system is hosed.  Rebooting might 
solve the problem.

Does not read either. ls -al says permission denied which means no read 
access. I came to the hosed conclusion much earlier but wanted to see if 
some wise men could help.

Am on Gutsy. Read some place that Synaptic run upgrades of X11 sometimes 
hoses /etc/mtab. Guess I'm a victim of that. Am left scratching my head.

Hmm. IIRC, the system should work even in the absence of /etc/mtab, albeit 
with some issues, with /proc/mounts. One thing to try out is to simply copy 
over /proc/mounts to /etc/mtab. /proc/mounts leaves out some of the details 
included in /etc/mtab, but at least, the system will work properly. You can 
also soft link /etc/mtab to /proc/mounts. The issues are minor IIRC.. 
something to do with loopback mounts or mounting with `user' not working 
properly.

Try replacing 'intel' with 'vesa' in the driver section and check if 
widescreen resolution works.
If it does, then the driver is the problem. You will have to add a new 
modeline for the resolution that you want.
To check the modeline that is being used, 'xvidtune -show' would help.
Do this for both 'vesa' and 'intel' and see if there any differences.

That would be a rather arbitrary scale for judging TG. I'm not very 
familiar with either of the frameworks, but a site's responsiveness (if 
that is what you are referring to) also depends a lot on the hardware 
that runs it. If run on a feeble machine, the most brilliantly coded web 
app would seem slow.

I would say the activity of a project is a better way to judge such 
stuff - in which case, TG hardly seems to be 'dead in the water' - the 
latest commit being on Jan 21st. There ought to be more objective 
reasons for that kind of statement.

Also, though unrelated, the TG way of doing things, i.e., putting 
together a bunch of open source web components and tying them together 
with a framework is just getting traction in the Ruby world too, viz., 
Merb as against Rails (which along with Django seems to favor monolithic 
core libraries).

Dear All,

The FossConf arrangements are going on in MIT. We are looking for
volunteers to setup the open lab, hall arrangements, co-ordination. So
volunteers can come and join in the on going tasks at NRC-FOSS, AU-KBC

when i was choosing between rails, tg and django in 2005, I joined  
all three IRC channels. There were 45 on tg, 45 on django and 400 on  
rails. Today tg has 45, django has 340 and rails has 290. As for  
sites and resources for django - http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/ 
DjangoResources and http://djangosites.org - nothing comparable on  
tg. If you check the mailing lists also you will find the same sort  
of proportion. If you look at the number of contributors of code you  
find django has more than tg and rails combined. Django has also  
increased it's pool of core devels from 2 to about 9 now, and more  
are in the Q. It is not just commits that denote activity. It is the  
community. Or watch the actvity on IRC - I was watching for the last  
10 minutes. Nothing on rails or tg and 3 screens of talk on django.

My method of choosing an app is:
1. Check the commit activity
2. Check activity on mailing list
3. Check activity on devel mailing list
4. Check how many core devels there are
5. Check if people without commit access are having their patches  
accepted
6. Check activity on IRC
Lurk and see how friendly the community is - django is incredibly  
friendly. Very rare to see an rtfm.

Django leads on all these criteria. Go lurk and see.

And, for a framework, check how much you tied to the framework. You  
should be able to bypass the framework without damage. Django excels  
that way.

Message-ID: <3f2beab60801292346ne249955of09097bdeee55f30@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We are pleased to inform you that National Institute of Technology,
Calicut will be hosting its annual free and open source software
conference, namely FOSS Meet @   NITC 2008, on 28th, 29th and 30th of
March 2008. This time the focus of the event is to get more students
actively involved in FOSS. As usual, there will be talks, BOFs,
workshops etc. - details of which will soon be put up on our website ?
http://www.fossmeet.in/nitc .

In addition to that, this year, we are starting a contest called
FOSSDev, to promote student participation in and contribution to FOSS.
Basically, a team wishing to participate has to find a mentor who will
help them contribute to a project of the participant's choice. FOSSDev
is a year long event. There will be three "checkpoints" at which
progress will be evaluated and prizes will be given accordingly. Total
prize money is Rs. 23,500. You can read more about FOSSDev at
http://fossmeet.in/nitc/fossdev .

This meet is organized by the GNU/Linux Users Group Calicut(GLUGC) in
association with Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,
Student Branch NIT Calicut [IEEE], Computer Society of India, Calicut
Chapter [CSI], Computer Science and Engineering Association [CSEA] and
all the volunteers from various walks of life.

Listen to people who already experienced the FOSS Meet spirit.

  * [...] NITC's FOSS event has grown in stature, and is quickly
becoming one of the recognized FOSS events in India, along with
Gnunify, Freedel and of course FOSS.IN. [...] - Atul Chitnis
http://atulchitnis.net/diary/showentry/420

  * [...]The organization of FOSS @ NITC surprised me, compared to
what I'd seen at other similar conferences. Compared to what went on
at GNUnify, these guys are a lot more decentralized in organization
and had quite a feel of a student run tech fest. I hardly saw any
faculty running around, except for Amarjeet. The faculty was more of
facilitiating the event rather than running the event and their pulls
on the event was not quite obvious, if any. Quite heartening indeed
from my point of view.[...] - Gopal V

Suresh,

According to my knowledge,
PHP will run in Server not at the browser(client),
So you cannot control the delay the display of images in browser using PHP
code.

You have to write some Javascript routine to hide and to show the
list of image objects one after another.

In the given code snippet here, you have tried to create list of
 <img src=".."></img> tag it seems. For this situation the code snippet
could be...
----
    $imagesArray = array (1,2,3,4);

    for ($i=0; $i<count($imagesArray); $i++) {
        echo "<img src='" . $imagesArray[$i] . ".png'></img>\n";
    }
----
Anyway this will list the images one by one only.

Please correct me, If any things wrong in it.

Regards,
Nahalingam.

  Thank you friends..  yes i had to use javascript only..
 here is the way i have implemented..

 <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript1.3">

                currentIndx=0;
                MyImages=new Array();
                var count=<? echo count($ImageArray); ?>;
                <? for($i=0;$i<count($ImageArray);$i++)
                {

                 ?>
                        MyImages[<? echo $i?>]=<? echo
$ImageArray[$i][URL]?>;
                <? } ?>
                    var delay = setTimeout("dispImg() ",5000);
                function dispImg()
                {

                    if (currentIndx<MyImages.length)
                    {

                        currentIndx=currentIndx+1;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        currentIndx=0;
                    }

                    document.dynImage.src=MyImages[currentIndx];

                    var delay1 = setTimeout("dispImg() ",5000);
                }


          </script>
            <img src= "" name="dynImage" alt="image1" width="387"
height="256" />

If you definitely want to use PHP for controlling the time, you can still do
that. Use server side push. Take a look at the mime multipart/x-mixed-replace.
But that might be a load on the server.

Hi,

   We have to purchase a server which will be used as web appilcation
server.We expect AMD based processor.Because as much as I know AMD
based can be strong while over heat. Please suggest me a good server
with linux distribution.Oracle will also be installed on it.

Hi Satheesh,
                   Well, AMD would be nice for small end server.
but if at all u need high performace, better go for ALPHA or Itanium.

The target user is not your regular linux geek. Not even a regular comp

mother ship everyday. I guess its a pretty good proposition for such uses!

Check here if you are in doubt http://h18002.www1.hp.com/alphaserver/

He wanted a server to host a web application, AMD or Core2Duo is well and
good at this.

Arul,
I am sorry to come hard at your suggestion.
It is good you wanted to help others, but be sensible. Alpha, Itanium or any
server at that class is generally not required for a *typical* web
application. If you are not sure ask the original poster about his exact
requirement.

Hi all,

Using the RoR ORM technique, I am not able to create a new row for some
tables (ie Mytable.new  or Mytable.create methods does not work), while at
the same time i can do the same for some other tables. Please can anyone

that was registered by sandip - but he has stopped supporting it - I  
think the hallofshame is shifted to the main linux-delhi.org domain

Hello pal,

I dont think Mytable is a reserved word in Rails convention. Any way
could you please recheck that Class Mytable is mapped to mytables and
not something like my_tables.

If that is the case Class Mytable need to be mapped to table my_tables
in case of a legacy of data, you can override it by using
model_name.classify.constantize tag. please google it for how to use
it.

Thanks

Satheesh's query is relating to hardware and not software.
Also, please change your post style, it's too difficult to find the
reply within it.

Try M-x iswitchb-mode RET

Then C-x b binds to an ultra cool function that allows you to switch to
buffer by substring match *anywhere* in the buffer name. Try it.

1. Open 30 files
2. M-x iswitchb-mode RET
3. C-x b  and then watch the minibuffer
4. Type any character and watch the minibuffer

Report back here on what you think of Emacs' capability is in 'switching
between open files'.

Another Emacs package that you should look into is ibuffer.el (Try M-x
ibuffer RET).

Have you ever wanted to list the details of the 120 buffers you have open in
your Emacs session, mark all the C, C++ and Java programs from them in one
command and convert all tabs to spaces, or query replace using regular
expressions on all those buffers, or insert a header/footer in each of a
specified subset of buffers?

I have. ibuffer.el makes it possible.
