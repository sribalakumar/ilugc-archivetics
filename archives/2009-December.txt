I think '-usb' is not needed, because we are passing usb device file as harddisk 
to qemu, '-usb' just enables 'usb stack' in qemu and it is useful when we 
passthrough 'usb' devices to qemu guest(e.g: -usb -usbdevice host:003.001). 
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

If you have to ask here how to do this, you are probably not well equipped to 
reliably secure a server at the moment. If this is a production server with 
important data, I would suggest hiring a capable professional to at least set 
things up for you.

That said, i have found these NSA guidelines being cited very frequently as a 
good and comprehensive starting point to securing your server:

Also, having a reverse proxy in a readonly server to interface with
the world and putting the actual webserver in DMZ is also one of the
many ways (in addition to firewalls).

MDI (Microsoft Document Imaging) extension format is a a high resolution,

 .MDI files are a propertary closed format supported only by the
Microsoft Office 2003,
and Office 2007 version with a little trick.

:-(

Linux has no MDI viewer.

There are some tools available for windows to convert MDI to PDF.

Please ask the bank to send the report in PDF format.
Mail them with the details of you as a linux user, can not open the file.

Share your experiences with the bank with us.

Thanks.

The linux kernel has a higher level API called AIO which abstracts out the 
filesystem implementation.

I don't understand what those terms mean to you. Is there a standard definition 
of the difference between concurrent and asynchronous IO in this context ?

Again, linux has a filesystem independent cache implementation for data as well 
as meta-data (viz inodes) known as the buffer cache. The buffer cache size can 
be seen using the command 'free' and can be tuned using sysctl parameters (these 
are dependent on your kernel version, since they have gone through several 
revisions over 2.4 and 2.6 releases).

A broad overview of the FS abstraction offered by the linux kernel:

Hi,
I am running ubuntu 9.10 Karmic on my laptop. I've ran the memory test which
shows during boot (memtest86+) and it ran successfully. But after I had
installed a theme for grub2 (ubuntu theme), when i choose memory test during
boot time, the computer just hangs. I've checked and rechecked the path to
memtest86+.bin in grub.cfg, and its perfect.

   1) Is it a bug in grub2?
   2) Does anyone else have a similar problem?
   3) Is there any workaround for this?

Hi everyone,

I use Evolution 2.26.1 on Ubuntu 9.04 and there's one little problem
that comes up when composing email that really bothers me.

I use Ctrl-Backspace to delete words at a time and this works fine
except for an unintended side-effect which I never see in any other
software: The deleted word is copied to the clipboard!

How do I stop this from happening?
Alternatively, is there a better way of doing this without moving my
hands from the keyboard? (No, ^W doesn't work)

Hi

My Windows partition won't boot anymore, throws BSoD. I have dual-boot [XP &
Ubuntu] & am trying to run an NTFS diskcheck similar to CHKDSK from Ubuntu
on the NTFS partition.

I tried to boot on Windows XP CD & work via Recovery Console but to no avail
as the Windows XP CD fails to even recognise the hard disk. Also tried
ntfsfix which reverts back in a second & says disks are fine, which is not
true.

Any other ideas?

I tried with mplayer, the same result. On the other hand. I don't know what
is the reason behind, cant install  vlc.
if I say yum install vlc, then it throws out dozens doesn't of dependency
error and the yum get failed in the installation.

For how long does it run? What happens when it stops functioning?

What happens if you disable power management? I had a computer stop
every time it attempted to enter Suspend-to-RAM (which it did if idle
for a while, watching a long video counted as idle).

What happens if you enter the grub2 prompt (C-c, if I remember right)
and manually load memtest?

May be

$ mplayer --verbose <videofile> | tee -a mplayer-hang.log

and pasting the log here will be useful.

Message-ID: <289b5e200912010926y33b8ca83rf4514d7605aa13b4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
I am multibooting a system with Ubuntu 9.04 & Windows XP.
I have installed firefox 3.5.5 in Ubuntu 9,04 following exactly the steps
outlined in the link below:

http://ubuntumanual.org/posts/193/installing-firefox-3-5-in-ubuntu-the-easy-way

However it crashes randomly while opening some sites. Is it due to some bug
in the firefox 3.5.5?
Since it is irritating I revert to the default version of Firefox 3.0.5
included in Ubuntu 9.04 which is working without any problem.
I would like to know if any one in the group faced similar problem and could
suggest a solution?

of so, reinstall the flash plugin.

In debian also most of the common modules are packaged, so that installing from cpan is not required. You can use apt-get instead.

This is what I did after pressing 'c' in the grub menu:

grub> ls
(hd0) (hd0,7) (hd0,6) (hd0,5) (hd0,1)
grub> set root=(hd0,6)
grub> linux16 /boot/memtest86+.bin
     [Linux-zImage, setup=0x800, size=0x1ed1c]
grub> boot
<!!!----- COMPUTER HANGS -----!!!>

Now, when I press <Esc> after the computer hangs, the computer
reboots. Why I am saying this is because <Esc> is used for rebooting
the system when the memory test is going on. So, is it that the memory
test is running, but I am not able to see anything on the screen? Is
there a workaround for this bug?

And for everything else, there's apt-file + dh-make-perl + a little bit
of rare manual dependency resolution.

* Use a file monitoring software like Tripwire
* Install an IDS (Snort comes to mind)
* Use a vulnerability scanner (Nessus) and fix stuff it reports

In general it is a process. Keep your systems up to date and make sure
you analyze logs regularly.

Also you might want to experiment with a different video output driver:

$ mplayer -vo help

will list all available drivers.

(for instance, you might have problems when you are using the xv driver when 
your X driver supports acceleration and GL is enabled -- in which case it is 
better to use the gl/gl2 mplayer video output drivers).

Mailing List Guidelines: Monthly reminder:

1. Use a proper subject line.

2. Do not troll in the mailing list

But, don't misuse this to start flame wars or to troll
in the mailing list.

4. Do not top-post:

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting

Example of a top-post:

Because it messes up the order in which
people normally read text.

5. Do not over-quote:

Example of an over-quote:

>>> On Friday you said

>> On Saturday you said
>> foo foo foo
> On Sunday you said
> foobar

6. Do not post HTML messages

7. Do not recycle messages

8. Do not send attachments

9. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal
disclaimers. If your company uses disclaimers, don't
use your company ID for the mailing list.

10. Do not reply to a digest. (If you are in digest
mode and want to reply to a post use ILUGC Gmane blog
interface.

Link:
http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

11. Search for answers for your questions/problems in
google.com or any other search engine before posting
your query to the mailing list.

If any of the above are not clear to you, Please read
the detailed list guidelines:

Link:
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

12. Do not post messages in all capital letters. Mails
in CAPS is considered rude and is similar to shouting
during a conversation.

13. Following these guidelines could be helpful
http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/

14. Don't send season's greetings or birthday or social networking site
 invites to the group. Its not mailing list etiquette.

We must use the above guidelines to maintain better
readability, proper archives, efficient bandwidth
usage, etc.

I switched to console mode and then tried running memtest86+. It's working :)
I guess its a bug in the graphical mode of grub2. Thank you anyway :)

The point is that memtest assumes that it is running in text
mode.

Perhaps grub2 should provide a shift back to text mode for running
programs that do not support a framebuffer.

Hi,

I am working on a product that involves networking functionalities.

The code is written in C and compiled using GCC to be run on an embedded
system with Linux.

Is there ways of reducing the size of .exe file to be run on an embedded
system?

I tried using the -O2 optimisation flags of gcc complier and reduced size by
2 MB.

My current exe size after optimisation by -O2 is 8MB.I need to reduce it to
3MB.

Are there any other methods of code size reduction? If so,please share.

Thanks,
Karthiga

I think the only other option is to recode the bulkier portions in asm
directly. i am not sure we can beat the compiler at its job, but
sometimes you know the system and can make sensible assumptions
unknown to the compiler.

Hi,

Bluescreen may happen due to so many errors.
Not only disk failure.

The funny part is you dont even know the reasons behind the bluescreen.
This is a nice time to get rid of the bluescreen.

You have already Orange Screen with Ubuntu,

Welcome to the wonderlands of Linux.

Message-ID: <26cfb6c70912030151m146006edlb7ec78537a2bfb88@mail.gmail.com>

Does anybody have a problem using Network Manager to DSL in Karmic
Koala(Ubuntu 9.10)? I read that there's a problem in connecting to DSL using
Network Manager but for some it seems to be working. So is it a bug or just
that I'm doing something wrong?

Also, I use the pon/poff to use the DSL(since Network Manger doesn't work),
after configuring the DSL with pppoeconf and after this my network manager's
stopped working: I cannot connect to the LAN using Network Manager(was able
to do so earlier before I used pppoeconf, pon or poff). Is that another
issue with Karmic or something in general? How do I fix this?

Message-ID: <26cfb6c70912030200g5d491aafhb6aa6815bbef4bf2@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to understand how an application works. Since gdb has this
feature of allowing me to step through each line of code, I decided to use
gdb to understand working of the application.

I compiled it specially for gdb using the following command

DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="noopt nostrip debug" debuild -b -us -uc


I loaded the file into gdb using

file <filename>

and it's loaded successfully and debugging symbols are found. But, when I
run the program, I get the following error.

Starting program: ~/Documents/sources/sudo
1.7.0_from_ubuntu/sudo-1.7.0/build-simple/sudo su
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Cannot find new threads: generic error

(As this error message gives away, i'm trying to understand the working of
the sudo command.)

What exactly does this error mean?

Are you statically linking your libraries or at run time?

Try "gcc -Os" and a smaller libc if possible.


Please provide details about your compiler/linker flags and
the output.  Without this, it's just a cat/mouse game of others
trying to guess your build environment and offer vague solutions.

Also follow mailing list guidelines and don't top post.

You could try optimising for size (-Os) rather than aggressive

 There is a general opinion not to use -Os for development and
deployment of code.

Only -O2 is suggested flag for optimisation.Why?

Aggressive optimization can
  1. introduce subtle bugs
  2. may actually slow down your code

O2 enables only the safe optimization techniques.

The following does the job beautifully and should be guest OS [1] 
independent!

echo "system_powerdown" | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:<[2]>

[1] tested with host openSUSE 11.1 and guestCentOS 5.3 KVMs - should 
work with other Linux.  No idea about Windows guest.

Does using -Os flag introduce such problems?

Kannel or other software will use a GSM modem or phone to send out the
final SMS.
Your mobile service provider will most likely stop you if you are
sending so many SMSs.
To set up a bulk SMS business, you'll either have to get in touch with
a mobile service
provider, or use one of the hundreds you can Google out. They charge
very little per SMS
and will do international SMSs too.

And sending each SMS will take some connection overhead (a few tens of
seconds I think) so that will also be a limiting factor on the number of SMS
you can send with a single device.

of culture and information. Millions of individuals are now sharing and
creating culture: copying, cutting, remixing, and participating in new and
different ways.**Sometimes this activity is transformative. Sometimes it?s
straight copying. In either case, there is a clear connection between this
sharing of culture and personal freedom.

*Attendees will learn: *This talk will explore how various conceptions of
?freedom? have shaped the social movements for free software, free culture
and free knowledge, and how this ideology has manifested itself in real
action. It will connect theory with practice, exploring and cultural
innovations and political changes that have spawned forth from these
movements. Lastly, it will make the case that the broad-based availability,
accessibility and abundance of culture is a good thing for a global society.

Not that I am aware of. -Os is -O2 as far as aggressiveness goes,
AFAIK. I have seen cases where -Os results in better performance that
-O3+ but that was gcc < 4 and is the subject of another thread :)

I got three phone calls from my friends, telling the same issue.

They asked for windows solutions and I replied them with Ubuntu CD.

I think there is some virus which is helping us to spread linux. :-)

Hi Friends..
   I have Ubuntu 9.04  in my Dell Inspiron 1525 Laptop.
In Windows Vista it automatically detects the WI-FI and connected.
But in Ubuntu the signal is often not detected.I load the Wireless module by

$modprobe wl

it gives the Error as

WARNING: All config files need .conf: /etc/modprobe.d/oss-compat, it
will be ignored in a future release.

This command
$iwlist scan
gives the error that

lo        Interface doesn't support scanning.

eth0      Interface doesn't support scanning.

eth1      Interface doesn't support scanning.

pan0      Interface doesn't support scanning.

ppp0      Interface doesn't support scanning.


How can i connect to the wi-fi in Ubuntu 9.04?

Hello there

As a routine task I keep sending emails to many of my clients by
copy/pasting the routine templates & I wanted to see if there was any tool
to copy/paste Text snippets on Linux. Then I stumbled on some other tools
like Snippits but were more complicated than I thought they'd be [too many
libraries needed - ruby ruby1.8-dev rdoc rubygems libruby-extras xautomation
xsel aspell libaspell-dev aspell-en].

Then AutoKey <http://autokey.sourceforge.net/> came to the rescue & its very
simple. I think you people would like it.

Hi

Is it possible that we have a task-manager for Firefox just like Chrome has
one? This comes real-handy when the browser hangs because one of the several
open tabs, hangs & you cannot afford to shut down the entire browser just
due to one culprit-tab.

Or is there a way if we could identify the problematic Firefox thread & kill
it alone via terminal?

Or is there already something that I haven;t noticed.

In Google Chrome, each tab is a separate process. So, its possible to kill
just one tab. AFAIK, this will be available in FF 3.6+ (or maybe 4.0)

Hi ,

I had a similar problem. My laptop had the broadcomm chipset.
I did "sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter" in ubuntu 9.10 ,
me not sure about the nuances of wireless, but to my surprise my
laptop worked charmingly well after the installation.

There is are ports of the bash/zsh/pdksh shells to the cygwin
environment of windows. Note that you will also need the ports of the
standard utilities which make the shell so powerfull under Unix.
These are also mostly available.

Kapil.

   You could use cygwin.

There are many other tools available as well using which you could emulate a Linux shell on top of windows

Check out Power Shell:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell
    http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx

It's freely (as in beer) available from Microsoft.

Power Shell not FOSS, so enough said.

Subject: [Ilugc] Compiling XIIth standard State Board code on Linux
Message-ID: <1259941757.3803.47.camel@mjolnir>

Hello, everyone,

My younger brother is in the XIIth standard at the moment, and is
required to write some basic C++ code in his practical exams. I have an
extra desktop running Ubuntu 9.10 on which I installed the basic stuff
(g++ 4.4, libstdc++6).

The students at his school are taught under the State Board curriculum,
and unfortunately the code they're supposed to replicate has the
following characteristics (and hence does not compile under g++ 4.4):

1. Uses stuff like:
	#include <iostream.h>
   instead of:
	#include <iostream>

   and as a result,

2. The objects cin, cout, ... are all assumed to be in the global
namespace.

3. main is declared 'void' instead of 'int'.

I'm pretty sure that iostream.h is deprecated and that using 'void main'
is not standard compliant?. However, I need this to compile.

Here are my questions:

1. What is the newest version of g++ and libstdc++ on which code like
this will successfully compile?
2. How do I install these safely alongside my current Ubuntu
installation?
3. I assume this sort of code is common across all schools. Does anyone
know if the state board accepts more modern code? In this case, I will
just inform the school.

? Please feel free to correct me, I'm no programmer.

Thank you for reading,

SCHOOLS? It is there in colleges. The Anna Univ syllabus calls for ANSI C++,
but requires using TurboC++ for labs!

If the hard disk works with linux but not windows, chances are that
there is some (mother board) driver issues with windows and not with
the file system. I have seen a couple of cases like this. Checking the
disk is not going to help. If you have your mother board driver CD,
then when you boot from the windows CD drive, there is an option where
you can load the drivers before it boots into the installation screen.
You have to press F2 or F8 - it mentions the key in the bottom of the
screen for a few seconds while booting up from CD. Try loading the
drivers and then repairing or reinstalling windows.

my daughter is in the same boat - I gave up, she went to the local browsing 
centre, got a copy of turbo C and installed it on an old doze machine in my 
wife's office (which she keeps because her printer is not linux compatible). One 
cannot torture kids with one's own principles. Anyway she is quite happy with 
linux for the past 8 years or so - except for this one thing. btw, I surprised 
your younger brother listens to you - mine never did ;-)

I have  Atheros  "AR5001 Wireless Network Adapter"  Mine was broken when 
i upgraded from 9.04 to 9.10 , try it may be an issue with yours too i  
did the following to fix it

#apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-karmic-generic
#apt-get install iw
#iw reg get
#iw reg set IN

create a shell script in /etc/init.d/wirelesscountrycode.sh with 
contents "iw reg set IN"

#chmod 755 /etc/init.d/wirelesscountrycode.sh

#update-rc.d wirelesscountrycode.sh defaults

Bala,
        I think you can try the perl script rather than shell script in both
windows and linux bcoz Perl is an independent platform application...

What will I do with it?  

If "smart cache" is something which tries to guess a mistyped domain, 
I'd rather know that I misttyped something than depending on a DNS 
server to take me somewhere else which may or maynot be the site I 
really wanted.

NB - this is a personal preference.  Others may find this feature 
useful.

It will as legal(illegal) under DOSbox as under windows. In fact those
who use Vista or newer versions of windows, too use dosbox to run
turbo C.

Why don't you use Codeblocks or Dev C++? Both are free software and far
easier to use that Turbo C.

I am using Codeblocks and Dev C++ for teaching community college teachers
at IIDA and they both work very well. Dev C++ is a bit clunky but
CodeBlocks is pretty good.

can they pass the exam in turbo C when they use the above? I am talking of 
kids who are uninterested in programming and just want to pass.

Hi,
How to inset page numbers in Open Document Text.

I am new to Ubuntu OS. For the past one Month I am using Ubuntu OS in My 
computer in our office. We have decided to install in all our computers. 
Our stenographers are trained in MS Office. They do not understand open 
office. Any one who has key shortcuts, please send it to me. So I can 
canvass them with the keyboard shortcuts.

If your office staff is trained to use MS Office then I am sure they 
know how to use the menus in each application.

OpenOffice is no different in that respect.  The menu items are there 
and if you navigate along each item you will see the options under each 
item.  

I would *strongly* suggest that at least one person in your office note 
down and note down the common things that your office staff does and 
tabulate those actions in two columns a) OpenOffice and b) MS Office.  
This way your staff will be able to relate their MSO actions ot 
OpenOffice readily.  Give your office staff a short demo on the common 
aspects of the word processing/spreadsheet.

Also, visit http://support.openoffice.org/ for docs/tutorials on the OO 
apps.

Specifically to your question regarding page numbering - in OO Writer 
Menu "Insert>Fields>Page Number" should do the trick for you.

Hi
   I am looking for an audio system that is suitable for a class room. Any
suggestions about how we can accomplish it with a laptop, a microphone and
couple of speakers.? I tried checking for a conventional system(wireless
microphone, attachable to shirt collar, amplifier, and speakers), but the
cost is huge and also maintainability is tough.

Thanks

Try this.. Account settings should be set as follows.

Login ID : your Gmail ID ( full email id  e.g. name@gmail.com )
Pwd : your pwd
Encryption required : checked
Ignore SSL : checked
Resource: <leave empty>
Priority: <default 0 >
Server: talk.google.com
Port : 5222

click "apply" and click "close"

You have a drop down saying "Offline" click that and select "Available".
That should fix it.

Let me know if you run into trouble

Where did you get these two from, Prem? The Codeblocks home page doesn't
work for me on Airtel but I managed to use Google Cache to get some URLs
to a nightly build. Unfortunately, this build doesn't seem to have come
with a compiler. Any help?

I have also been unable to get Dev-C++ from the Bloodshed website
because everything eventually leads to a broken link there.

I'll probably have to follow the advice you and Mehul have given me and
go with Turbo C++ and Dosbox. It isn't ideal, though. I'm certain that
to stare at red strings on a blue background will instil in my brother a
deep hatred of 'computer science'.

My younger brother listens to me in these situations only because then
he doesn't have to do the work ;)

So I've heard. I hope the code at least compiles on other compilers.

my problem is that I do not know C. The other problem is that turbo C will be

OpenDNS is useful because it has many features which can be enabled/disabled
on your own profile. It has a lot of inbuilt features for security(
anti-phishing ), filtering , easy web shorctuts and a lot more if you are
willing to dish out some cash.
Also, while using smart caches you would know if you mistyped something if
you are redirected to another url by observing the address bar

Hi all,
In our college, we have a mod_python based web application for our
intranet portal. We have a local testbed where the student devs have
their own logins and they work on their own subversion working copies
and publish their sites using mod_python configuration in
/etc/apache2/sites-available/default and userdir module. But we very
often face a problem like this.

All the users have their own copies of the web application and when
one user opens and navigates through the web application when other
user is doing the same with his copy, on clicking links and all, all
the addresses start getting changed into those of the other user and
not mine. We use Debian Lenny and the versions of apache2 and
mod_python shipped with them with the mpm-prefork module. How to avoid
such an issue.

For example when I click on a link in a site
http://localhost/~user1/blah it gets changed it to
http://localhost/~user2/blah and causes confusions. This issue happens
only when the users publish their own sites and use them concurrently.


Thank you.

Regards,
Guruprasad.

You're probably getting an IP address and DNS through dhclient. Add the
following to /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf

	prepend domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4;

I have found a solution to the problem from
http://mailman.modpython.org/pipermail/mod_python/2009-December/026397.html.

The idea is to create a sub-interpreter for every published site by
using 'PythonInterpreter' directive. I can use directives like

<site1>
PythonInterpreter site1
</site1>

<site2>
PythonInterpreter site2
</site2>

where
PythonInterpreter directive has to be given a unique name that could be
anything.

I don't remember the exact name, I replaced my Fedora 11 install a while
back. Look under /etc for dhclient.conf or dhclient-[interface].conf.
You'll need to find out what the interface name of your BSNL card is and
choose the appropriate file.

I don't have access to fedora machine right now to check but you
should find it as follows
1. Right click on NetworkManager applet.
2. Click on Edit Interfaces.
3. Select the interface you connect to.
4. Go to IPv4 settings and manually set DNS there.
See if this works

IMO, any business starts with an idea, followed up with implementation.

In the implementation you can choose either FOSS or proprietary tools 
that meets your requirements.  The key word is "requirement" - you and 
only you can define the requirements based on your idea.

With giving any inkling about your businees idea, it is difficult to

Hi,

In my work place I am configuring squid. I was unable to configure the same.

I require your help on the same.

a) My proxy server has 2 NIC's eth0 is used for LAN "192.168.100.200" and eth1 is used for outside world "192.168.1.7"

b) I would like to configure the squid for allowing mentioned / listed of websites for my LAN users. other than these sites squid should not allow to browse. say for example : wwww.manupatra.com, www.wipo.int, www.findlaw.com etc.

I tried in google i am unable to understand. and it blocks entire sites, even though i have mentioned in a file at "/usr/local/etc/allowed-sites.squid"

Thanks in advance for your timely help.


YOUR'S

Suggest you use Squid Guard (www.squidguard.org) if you want
any website blocking/control on your Squid server.  Squid Guard
is flexible and can scale up easily.

The mentioned website has plenty of docs on getting you started.

a) My proxy server has 2 NIC's eth0 is used for LAN "192.168.100.200" and
eth1 is used for outside world "192.168.1.7"

b) I would like to configure the squid for allowing mentioned / listed of
websites for my LAN users. other than these sites squid should not allow to
browse. say for example : wwww.manupatra.com, www.wipo.int, www.findlaw.com
etc.

I tried in google i am unable to understand. and it blocks entire sites,
even though i have mentioned in a file at
"/usr/local/etc/allowed-sites.squid"

Thanks in advance for your timely help.

Suggest you use Squid Guard (www.squidguard.org) if you want
any website blocking/control on your Squid server.  Squid Guard
is flexible and can scale up easily.

The mentioned website has plenty of docs on getting you started.

Here are my thoughts,
Disable password login to your remote server, use ssh keys instead.

If possible configure your system so that  it stores logs in another system.

Find out the open ports and check for any know vulnerabilities .

Somebody local with access to a machine in RO could have come in and 
cracked your system and make it appear that the attacker is physically 
from RO.

Smart guy.

For RPM based distro you can verify the integrity of your files 
with --verify option; assuming the cracker has not messed with your rpm 
data base.  I don't know the Debian equivalent.

Plenty depending on his/her admin skill, most likely the cracker ran a 
script do to all the dirty work for him/her.

You may luck out with the cracker just wanting to break in and if your 
file integrity checks out in your favor.

Rather than spinning your wheel figuring out what is b0rked;   a fresh 
install would save you time.  After a fresh install create a `ro' 
signature db of your files (aide/tripwire) and keep a copy in a 
separate location.  aide/tripwires can be configured to check integrity 
of the installed files v/s in the signature db.

Suggest you contact a computer forensic consultant if there is valuable 
data on the system and/or want to report the crime.

Sorry for the top post,


Setup an iptables based connection limiting rule so that you deny more
than 3 ssh connects per minute from any IP address.

Ther are more intelligent scripts like fail2ban, but I usually find a
simple 2 line iptables connection limiter sufficient to stop bots from
brute forcing your passwords.

Thanks for inputs.

Found the culprit. :-)


Found that some cracker entered on Dec 3 as user saravanan.

He runs so many ssh daemons and do a lot of port scans to other servers.

ps aux | grep ssh | wc -l
450

found so many processes like ./ssh 270 and ./x

there should not be any separate process like ./ssh and ./x

so searched in /home/saravanan.

hahaha. here, the thief lives.

found some hidden folders as ".a" ".c" ".d" and "h" in /home/saravanan

In the folders there are so may scripts to call ssh and do portscan
and try various username/password by using bruteforce algorithm.

This made our server to scan many servers and they mark us spam.

I deleted the .a .c .d h folders.

killed all ssh processes.

As per arun khan's suggestion, requested the remote server admin for a
re-install. :-)

After re-install, I will put the firewall rules as per raja's suggestion.

Will hear arun sag's  suggestions too.

Thanks a lot friends.

The root cause of the issue are

1. very very very weak password for user saravanan.
2. there is no firewall
3. no powerful logging methods
4. no limits on no of processes/diskspace

Thanks.

his institution. He wants something like.... which will scan each and every

Are there any mail server like this?

Mailscanner has this capability where you can create rule files to match 
headers and take action. This is separate piece of software that operate 
between the incoming SMTP queue and the actual distribution queue. Works 
only with sendmail/postfix.

Look up http://www.mailscanner.info

Does anybody have a problem using Network Manager to connect to a DSL in
Karmic Koala(Ubuntu 9.10)? I read that there's a problem in connecting to
DSL using Network Manager but for some it seems to be working. So is it a
bug or just that I'm doing something wrong?

Also, I use the pon/poff to use the DSL(since Network Manger doesn't work),
after configuring the DSL with pppoeconf and after this my network manager's
stopped working: I cannot connect to the LAN using Network Manager(was able
to do so earlier before I used pppoeconf, pon or poff). Is that another
issue with Karmic or something in general? How do I fix this?

Just set the environment variable EXTRAQUEUE=cto@yourdomain.org

and all mails passing through the system gets copied to cto@yourdomain.org

This feature of IndiMail is used by ISP's to comply with law enforcement
agencies (in fact was developed because of requirement from law enforcement
agencies).

Additionally, IndiMail supports access list at recipient and sender level.
You can control who all can send an email to the CTO. You can also control
which employees can send emails to outside domains and which cannot. Some of
the features of IndiMail meet exactly the need of many corporates and cannot
be found in postfix or sendmail.

IndiMail is free and you can contact me for any further info or help in
implementing / installation.

Hi Mathivanan,

You should first understand how certifications work from the
perspective of a vendor who offers such certification say Microsoft,
Redhat or SAP. The vendor has an economic interest in selling his
product to a company. The company which buys a product (or a service
in case of Redhat) wants to know if the product/service they buy can
be used by people they are going to employ. This is where the
brilliance of marketing sets in.

They con the students and candidates in the job market that there are
several jobs awaiting them if only clear the certification in their
technology. They then go and talk to all the colleges and institutes
like NIIT and convince them to market the certification and giving
them the necessary materials to make it a course. They then contact
book authors who fill in pages and pages with mind numbing facts about
the technology. The institute in the meanwhile has started tailoring a
course to and claims that it can get you from a dud to a certified
professional in 3 months. As with any statistical distribution in a
country with a billion people, a sizable few take up the
certifications. The first few batches are always tough. Only the good
guys clear the first 3 or 4 batches. But good guys like to share
knowledge. So they share the dumps with the world.

The vendor does nothing to oppose this as they need that pool of
skills in the market. After they have got enough number of people with
the piece of paper with the name of the vendor and a printed signature
of the CEO/founder of the company, the marketing department gets busy
making powerpoint slides. The slides have graph of stating the number
of people who have finished the certification and how easy it would be
for their customers to find the right skills. And since the numbers
(supply) are aplenty and the licensed customers are a few (demand), by
the laws of economics, they should have no problem in finding people
with the right skills (and a cheap pay).

The mindless HR then goes and "recruits" people with certifications.
So if you notice, if you are a good candidate, you can lower your
value just by getting certified. There are alternative means to
improve your employability. You can start contributing to open source
for a start. Do not pick difficult projects. If you cannot find a
project, try building something. Try creating a simple webapp or a
game. I am seeing too many freshers with "Biometric AI-Driven Neural
Network Enabled Grid Based Path Finding World Domination Engine" on
their resumes. And they want me to believe that they did it in 3
months without being able to write fizz buzz in their favorite
language.

As an employer myself, I would recommend you to do the following. Take
up a small project. A small pong game or a simple webapp that solves
your problem and document all your learnings in a blog. This will make
you a better writer and a better programmer. Use open source
technologies. Apart from being the best choice in terms of freedoms
that you get, you also get to interact directly with better
programmers in mailing lists like these.

To pioneer a change, I, on behalf of Artha42 (http://www.artha42.com),
am ready mentor a select group of students every year. Your work will
be entirely open sourced. I promise that you will not write a single
line of proprietary code. That said, we are not google. We are a small
startup with limited resources. We cannot hold something as large as
the Google Summer of Code. But we can do something smaller. If you are
interested in such an internship opportunity, do drop in a line to
careers <at> artha42 <dot> com.

To create a database you have to do the following.

mysql -uroot -pmypasswd

and in the mysql prompt execute the following command

create database mydatabase;

       Try this "mysql -u root -p" By default you have no password for root 
account.Just hit the return key for password.And check that your current user is 
included in the mysql user group (system ->administration->users and groups).I 
think mysql is what you want and not mysqladmin.

@Mudmbai -- I suggest that you blog the first 4 paras of your posting.  
They capture the essence of the certification training market, 
especially in India.

With respect to certification, my own experience has been that the 
candidates treat them like their university/diploma exams, pay through 
their nose for boot camp sessions and pass the exams with flying 
colours.  Their objective is to get 80% or higher; in their minds they 
think it puts them in a better position to negotiate for a higher 
salary.  Yet, you give them a simple day to day type problem to solve 
and they end up taking inordinate time to solve it (if at all they can 
solve it).

I run a small IT infra management consulting service in Mumbai.  We 
manage the whole IT infra of small companies.  Over the last 24 months 
I have interviewed close to 60 candidates for entry level admin 
positions.  Majority of them were certified for a very popular 
commercial distro in India.  We conduct a quiz of 45 questions on the 
fundamentals of Linux and Network configuration.  About 25% of the 
questions are ambiguous (deliberately); to test their adaptability of 
their (book) knowledge.  The best score that I have till date is 15/45; 
this was a guy who had given his cert. exam two weeks before the 
interview and had scored 85%!

Another candidate (with 90% in the cert. exam) kept on trying to connect 
to the openLDAP server for one whole day w/o verifying if the service 
was running or not!

Then there were candidates who wanted to be "Network Admins"  with 
absolutely no aptitude in that field.  Why Network Admin?  The salary 
is good!

After the above experience, I tell the candidates upfront - their 
certifications are **worthless** if they cannot demonstrate their 
ability to solve real world problems on the client's systems and 
network.

With the above frustration,  I have started a 3 month internship program 
(stipend with intense training on the shop floor) and it is working 
out.

To the OP I would suggest that you figure out which market segment you 
want to be in, what **you** are **passionate about**; not what your 
friends and family tell you.  

Begin to think for yourself - no harm in asking questions but make your 
own decisions.

Get into an internship program and slog it out - get real hands on 
experience and then take the certification exam.  I guarantee that you 
will be a worthwhile certified engineer in that domain and not a paper 
tiger like the majority of your peers.

Vagmim,
    Great analysis.

Opensource is all great, but still I hope you do acknowledge
the fact that big names like M$, Oracle, Sun (well.. now Oracle)
dominate the space as well. So certification is a value-addition
in some sense.

Forgive me but I do not understand what you are saying here.

What has the talk about certifications got anything to do with whether Open 
Source is great or whether M$, Oracle, Sun etc dominate ?

If I understood Vagmi correctly, the post was about the huge disconnect between 
the certification 'industry' and the problem of ascertaining whether a person is 
capable of carrying out any useful 'real world' tasks related to the certification.

Not that I agree that certification has it's value[1], but I fail to understand 
the connection you are trying to make.

Agreed. I am just trying to explain the economics behind it. But tell
me. If you are hiring, which do you think is better? A guy with an
active blog about his experiences and learnings of whatever technology
he is working on or a guy who just has a certificate on his resume.
The problem is that there are so many people doing certifications the
wrong way (read dumps) that the marginal value of the certificate is
close to zero. One other reason why most certifications are multiple
choice questions is that the test can be cheaply administered to a
large number of candidates. The marginal cost for the organization to
hand out yet another certificate is the cost to store your certificate
details and the printout of the certificate they give. In contrast,
you pay several tens of thousands to get that database entry and a
printed parchment. You must understand that certification is a viable
and profitable revenue source for a company like MS/Oracle/Sun. They
will never tell you that their certificates are worthless.

You might gain some knowledge by preparing for such a test but you do
not have to pay them that money. You can use that knowledge in
building something on your own and sharing your experience via a blog.
All the companies that you mentioned above are critically aware that
developers and administrators are the backbone of their ecosystem. All
of them give away free versions of their software under educational
license. Even Microsoft has dirt cheap/free student licenses. Oracle
gives away their database for free for personal use. Solaris and the
Java stack is free for developers.

There is nothing that justifies a high price for the certification.
Now coming to the choice of technologies, let me put forth this
argument. Why would you want to get certified in Java/Sun/Oracle? You
want to be employed by one of the companies using these products. You
have to get into the minds of the managers who buy such products.
These products clearly cost more and are harder to customize. ASP.NET
begets with it the entire stack. I have seen companies who think ah..
IIS is free until they find the need to configure DNS and active
directory and SQL Server licensing limitations. They are ready to bear
the cost because they know that they can get cheap developers and
admins to offset the cost on the license. Consequently, most of the
ASP.NET sites are crap. Not because the technology is inferior but the
marketing machinery is optimized for targeting the largest section of
the market. This in other words is called mediocrity. It is a
fail-fail for everyone. MS fails as people know that asp.net sites are
very maintenance heavy. The client fails to get a quality solution and
vendor is stuck forever with mediocre people. Every one of the company
you mentioned above targets this segment of the market. All I ask of
is for people to realize this.

We are hackers and we like to create things. That is what gives us
satisfaction. And building things requires you to focus single
handedly on that task. This is the discipline that is most required
out of current generation of students. They need to focus on one
project, use all the resources that they can exploit and finish it.
This is way harder than it sounds and thats why many people do not do
it. This is why I made the offer of being a mentor. I can help them to
focus and provide them with the resources with the best of my
abilities. Basically I want to find smart people and train them on how
to get things done.

My intentions are not entirely altruistic. I do have a selfish motive
behind this. I would be able to identify good candidates in this
process and can build my team. The interns get to work on a real
project and show it to the world. It is a win-win situation.

On the issue of certification, Mr.Baskar was narrating how a company conducted interview. They defined a set of tasks like setting LDAP,firewall etc. The prospective candidate was asked to set it up. The company provided machine, software etc. The candidate was given time - two days in a particular case - to prepare and come back. The candidate setup the system as per the laid down criteria and got the job.
No questions- multiple choice, fill in the blanks etc.

A nice idea, though not suitable for large scale recruitment.

This page details the hardware required to run *Ubuntu* and/or its KDE 
<https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KDE> derivative Kubuntu 
<https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kubuntu>, as well as other versions.

Some of the hardware specifications quoted on this page are estimates. 
You may be able to run Ubuntu successfully on hardware of a lower 
specification than that specified, although performance is likely to be 
very poor.

The *minimum requirements* are only likely to allow a server 
(non-graphical) installation to run well. The *recommended minimum 
requirements* should allow you to run a graphical installation of Ubuntu 
well.


  Desktop installation

Most people will want to install a desktop system such as *Ubuntu*, 
*Kubuntu*, or *Xubuntu*. A desktop system is typically used for personal 
computing tasks and has a graphical user interface.


    Bare Minimum requirements

It should be possible to get Ubuntu running on a system with the 
following minimum hardware specification, although it is unlikely that 
the system would run well. You should use the /Alternate install CD/ to 
attempt such an installation.

    * 300 MHz x86 processor
    * 64 MB of system memory (RAM)
    * At least 4 GB of disk space (for full installation and swap space)
    * VGA graphics card capable of 640x480 resolution
    * CD-ROM drive or network card


    Recommended minimum requirements

Ubuntu should run reasonably well on a computer with the following 
minimum hardware specification. However, features such as visual effects 
may not run smoothly.

    * 700 MHz x86 processor
    * 384 MB of system memory (RAM)
    * 8 GB of disk space
    * Graphics card capable of 1024x768 resolution
    *

      /Sound card/

    *

      /A network or Internet connection/

*Note:* All 64-bit (x86-64) PCs should be able to run Ubuntu. Use the 
64-bit installation CD for a 64-bit-optimised installation.


    Recommended for visual effects

/Visual effects/ provide various special graphical effects for your 
desktop to make it look and feel more fun and easier to use. If your 
computer is not powerful enough to run visual effects, you can turn them 
off and will still have a usable Ubuntu desktop.

Visual effects are turned on by default if you have a graphics card 
which is supported. For information on supported graphics cards, see 
DesktopEffects <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DesktopEffects>.

    * 1.2 GHz x86 processor
    * 384 MB of system memory (RAM)
    *

      Supported graphics card (see DesktopEffects
      <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DesktopEffects>)


  Lightweight alternative (Xubuntu)

If you have an old or low-spec computer or want to get the most out of 
your hardware, using a lightweight desktop system such as *Xubuntu* is 
recommended, as it should make more efficient use of your system's 
resources. Of course, even if you have the newest equipment out, you 
could still use Xubuntu.

If your system has less than 192 MB of system memory, use the /Alternate 
Installation CD/.

*Note:* If you have a low-specification computer, certain features may 
be automatically turned off to conserve system resources. For example, 
if you have a graphics card with only a small amount of video memory 
(VRAM), the boot-up screen may not be shown.

Follow this link for detailed instructions: 
Installation/LowMemorySystems 
<https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LowMemorySystems>.

Please remember that the (minimum) requirements here are only 
directional. You might be able to install Xubuntu on systems with less 
RAM, but in these cases the performance will be greatly degraded.

If your specifications are lower than the minimum requirements but you 
still want to install Xubuntu in your machine, please consider using 
pre-8.04 releases (preferably try 7.10 first and go to 6.06 (LTS) if you 
can't get it working).


    Bare Minimum requirements

    * 300 MHz processor
    * 192 MB of system memory (RAM)
    * At least 1.5 GB of disk space
    * VGA graphics card


    Recommended minimum requirements

    * 700 MHz processor
    * 256 MB of system memory (RAM)
    * 6 GB of disk space
    * Graphics card capable of 800x600 resolution


  Netbook alternative (Ubuntu Netbook Remix)

If you have a netbook and a supported graphics card, using *Ubuntu 
Netbook Remix* is an interesting option. It has a nice interface adapted 
for smaller screens, and a selection of applications aimed at netbook 
users.

Because the launcher uses OpenGL, your graphics card needs to be fully 
supported under Ubuntu in order to run smoothly.


    Supported graphics cards

    * ATI cards (R6xx/R7xx may require the proprietary fglrx driver)
    * Recent Intel cards (i915 or better, except GMA 500 / Poulsbo / SCH)
    * NVidia cards with the proprietary NVidia driver


    Recommended minimum requirements

Ubuntu Netbook Remix should run reasonably well on a computer with the 
following minimum hardware specification.

    * 700 MHz x86 processor
    * 384 MB of system memory (RAM)
    * 6 GB of disk space
    * Graphics card capable of 800x600 resolution and 3D (OpenGL)
    *

      /Sound card/

    *

      /A network or Internet connection/


  LTSP thin-client computers

If you are intending to use a computer as a thin client (such as a 
client for an *Edubuntu LTSP Terminal Server*), only a low-specification 
computer capable of displaying graphics and connecting to a network is 
required.


  Absolute minimum installation

The absolute minimum Ubuntu installation provides only a command-line 
interface and installs very few packages. You can add additional 
packages and a graphical interface manually.

In order to install the absolute minimum installation, use the 
/Alternate Installation CD/.

It is possible that you will be able to install Ubuntu on computers with 
lower specifications than those given below. However, installation may 
be extremely difficult and Ubuntu is likely to run very slowly on such a 
system.


    Absolute minimum requirements

    * Intel 486 processor
    * 32 MB of system memory (RAM)
    * 300 MB of disk space


    Absolute minimum graphical installation

    * Intel Pentium 66 MHz processor
    * 48 MB of system memory (RAM)
    * 468 MB of disk space
    * VGA graphics card

(Based on the Ubuntu/Debian-Sarge Mini-RAM HOWTO 
<http://www.binonabiso.com/en/Ubuntu-miniRAM-HOWTO.html>.)

Nice effort. But how many were willing to join as apprentices?

My experience.
1. People want to get paid for learning at the employer's office without any "serious" contribution to the employer. Whereas they have spent  the last few years paying a ransom and not learnt even a tenth in value of the money's worth.
2. We don't insist on any degree / certification. A +2 will do. (just to make sure he / she is above 16 years)
3. We look for coding skills , attitude to learn by doing. 
4. 90% of those who come for interviews with us could not even attempt the hands on coding test. They had sent "impressive " resumes.
5 It is obvious that institutions teach what they want to teach and not what is required by the industry.

Hi,

Some thoughts below:

I am not sure about the 'learning' part though :) I agree to the latter.

GE, once, migrated 30000 Windows servers to GNU/Linux, and eight
people were selected. There was a B.Sc. Physics student from Erode,
Tamil Nadu who enjoyed working with GNU/Linux (having the curiousity
of how things work), and everything he learnt has been through
self-study, working with the system, mailing list discussions,
searching online for answers etc. He was skilled with this and was
hired for the job!

IIRC, he didn't even clear his B.Sc. Physics papers :p

---

True. That is why F/OSS unconferences are very important, and they
have to *exist* in every city/town/village in India. We can see how
people work, communicate, interact and help each other in an
unconference, and recruit them, rather than waste time reading fancy
resumes or searching "job portals".

Agreed.

They shouldn't teach what is required by the Industry, IMO. They
should teach to use free/open standards, and tools.

SK

It is an on going pilot.  A couple have finished their internship BUT 
they have worked out for me; one dropped out after 3 weeks.

I am using this process to weed out the chaff, those who want the 
training at the expense of small cos.  Once inducted into full time we 
make a commitment for 24 months and likewise ask the same from the 
candidates - I think it is fair to both sides.

That is indeed the sad part.  About 50% ask what is the pay scale rather 
than details about the job description.  They are only interested in 
the money and not doing anything useful for their employer.  It 
pervades in all the disciplines not just IT.

Collectively, of the past several years, they have created a brand name 
for themselves.  Some of them don't care - they do not return my calls 
when I ping them to send over potential candidates!  Some have deep 
pockets to become "Training Partners"; gives them branding.  

The instructors are fresh grads either from their own institution or 
similar place (who most likely could not get a job on merits).

u can enter as single user mode then u can change the root password, for
entering single usermode,
when the grub prompt appear:
1. use up or down arrow key
2.select the os line, then press e to edit
3. u will get 3 lines root (hd0,0), kernel and initrd
4. select kernel line and press e to edit
5. then u will find one single line which is ur kernel image line, give
space and give 1
6. press enter, it will come back to the old menu
7. select again kernel line and press b to boot the system
8. once system will find 1 in kernel part, it will move to single user mode,
by saying telling init to go to single user mode
9. give passwd command, it will ask root's new passwd, change it then press
exit to go to the default run-level which is mentioned in ur file
/etc/inittab.
10. Otherwise u can also int run-level, to move to particular run-level.

I dont use ubuntu. But I think there will be an intel driver in the repos

apt-cache search i810 must do the trick.

On Archlinux, it is named xf86-video-intel

I expect something like xorg-*-i810 in Ubuntu

Did you upgrade an existing installation?. I think i810 driver is now part of intel. If you are retaining old xorg.conf try changing driver to intel, it may work.

Thank You For all those who helped me
I did by the following

1. I downloaded a py document converter script Given by Srinivasan Sir
above.

2. Then Created a shell script below
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Assigning the location of the openoffice's "oofice and soffice" and Python
Location
OOFFICE=`ls /usr/bin/openoffice.org /usr/bin/ooffice
/usr/lib/openoffice/program/soffice | head -n 1`
OOOPYTHON=`ls /usr/lib/openoffice/basis3.1/program/ /usr/bin/python | head
-n 1`

if [ ! -x "$OOFFICE" ]
 then
  echo "Could not auto-detect OpenOffice.org binary"
  exit
fi
if [ ! -x "$OOOPYTHON" ]
 then
  echo "Could not auto-detect OpenOffice.org Python"
  exit
fi

killall -u `whoami` -q soffice

$OOFFICE
"-accept=socket,host=localhost,port=8100;urp;StarOffice.ServiceManager"
-norestore -nofirststartwizard -nologo -headless &
if [$OOOPYTHON DocumentConverter.py $1 $2]
 then
  echo "Error in Processing Document"
  exit
fi
echo "Conversion done"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

execute the script as
./convert.sh test.odt test.pdf

Is this is a Hands-on session? Would we able to build a Custom android
application on-site by the end of the session ? Are there any requirements -
laptop, software etc. ?

Workshop is for newbies and level of each person may differ a lot.
So we are not aiming for a hands-on session. But you can bring your
laptops for a parallel hands-on. The simulator software will
available in CD/DVD during the workshop, you can use that to install
it in your **Linux** based machine.

There is a problem sometimes when you install it for the first time. What
you have to do then is start the MySQL daemon in safe mode. Follow the
following steps
1. Stop the Mysql service $ /etc/init.d/mysql stop
2. Start MySQL daemon in safe mode $ mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables
3. Now login to mysql with root user with NO password $mysql -u root
4. Now you will get the mysql prompt, and can alter the users in the mysql
database as u please

NOTE: This is a workaround if you cannot recover the password otherwise

There will be atleast one account with sudo enabled in most cases. Login to
that account and enter the following:

               $ sudo passwd

Enter the password of the current account and you will be prompted for new
root password.

Better make that "sudo passwd root" to be absolutely sure that you
are changing the root password and your own.

What do you mean by 'internet server' ? Please elucidate your requirements
properly.
If you want to set up a server publicly accessible, then make sure you have
a public IP set up for the server machine, and then make sure you've added
it to the dns servers also.

Is it that you want to setup an intranet by configuring a number of client
machines to access a website running on a Linux Server(on a webserver) OR is
it that you want to want to configure your server for Public Internet
Access?

Is this for your personal (home) network or at your work place?

For the latter case, do yourself and your employer a favor; get 
professional help to do the setup.  

There are some great books here: <http://www.tldp.org/guides.html>

Olaf Kirch's Network Administrator Guide 
<http://www.tldp.org/LDP/nag2/nag2.pdf> is a great place to learn about 
networking.

nice read. strangely enough, although I hold most certifications in contempt, I 
have been working on a certification that is launching shortly. I have been 
dreaming of this for the past several years. My idea is that even a person who 
does not pass the certification is going to learn something. Although the site 
has not been formally launched, please take a look and tell me what you think.

Message-ID: <200912101642.02353.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

In our Indian osm server (http://openstreetmap.in) we upload the data to the 
database every day. Part of the process involves restarting the rendering 
engine - and deleting the tiles. There is no need to delete the tiles 
actually, because within 24 hours all caches expire and the new data will be 
served. Unfortunately some guy from Punjab will start yelling 'where is the 
well I marked in my village?'. So to be practical the tiles should be deleted 
so that the renderer will be forced to show the latest data. So I do:

cd /var/lib/mod_tile/default
rm -rf *

my problem is I want to cron this - but am terrified of putting 'rm -rf *' in a 
cron job - I do not want the server to get fried due to some mistake. So is 
there any 150% safe foolproof way of doing this?

some modification

   cd /var/lib/mod_tile/default

Also rm -rf can be replaced by
find /var/lib/mod_tile/default -type f -exec rm -f {} \;


The above find command avoids the use of wildcard and hence the error
"argument list too long" can be avoided in case the directory gets filled up
with thousands of files

Hi,
I want to know if there is a way to access a Fedora PC from a Windows XP machine through RDP Client (mstsc) in Windows XP.
I know we can access through XManager or VNC. But both are blocked/restricted in my office.

Please let me know if there is a option to do the same.

To put it simple is there a RDP server for Fedora available?

No it will only delete everything which comes under default directory,
but not the default directory itself.

Opensuse 10 reached end of life long time ago. so is 10.1, 10.2 and now 10.3
since a few days ago. This means, for any versions earlier than 11, you will
not be able to install packages using Yast from the official repositories.
The latest version of opensuse is 11.2.  I suggest you to use more recent
version of opensuse (11 or later).  If this is not feasible for you, do
consider installing package from source.



Thanks

A Debian/Ubuntu user can use xrdp + tightvnc. A quick google shows that
both are available for Fedora 11. I just installed them again to give it
a shot and it worked (although there was some trouble with gnome-keyring
and gnome-settings-daemon).

I'd like to emphasise that you're probably going to have a painful
experience if you choose to use something like what's provided with
Debian's vnc4server software instead of tightvncserver.

This will be incredible slow because find will launch an rm
process for every single file which matches the search criteria.
Using xargs like this provides faster performance:
    find /some/path -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rm


But another problem the OP will face with this command
is that it will only delete files and leave empty directories
behind.



IMO, running rm directly would be the best option.


KG: for an extra level of security, you can set file permissions
to ensure that only these files can be deleted by the cron script
and no other data can be touched.

           Use the -A option of the grep command. A man grep would
have helped :)

grep -i begin -A4  <FILENAME>

if you do not have spaces before text in the file, you might as well use
grep -i ^begin -A4 <FILENAME>

Dear all,

I'm thinking of getting a BSNL EVDO data card for internet access on
my laptop. I heard that the cards used are manufactuered by Huawei, a
Chinese company. I want to be sure if drivers exist for this
peripheral on GNU/Linux before I splurge on the card. Does anyone have
experience with EVDO data cards on GNU/Linux?

the generic usb serial driver worked well for me after 2.6.29 , and moreover
I guess with the present distros( the latest ones) you will not face any
problem configuring it.

     Ask your network admin he will do some things like vpn or port
forwarding so that you can access the machines .

we have a workaround though, this one will clean everything under 
/var/lib/mod_file/default.

cd /var/lib/mod_file/default; find . | 2>/dev/null xargs rm -fr

Wouldn't using ; be a bad idea? Say, for some reason e.g. permission
issue, it is unable to cd to the location. You will end up deleting
wrong files and do unnecessary damage. I believe using & would be a
better idea in this case.

Thanks for catching, it should be

cd /var/lib/mod_file/default && find . | 2>/dev/null xargs rm -fr

Debian is supporting ARM platform. so you can build complete root file
system from scratch with JVM support.

Yuvaraj, has already answered your question - vpn or ssh.

Logmein (www.logmein.com) is another option.

That's where the port forwarding comes in. You will log in to the public
IP and a specific port. That port will then be forwarded to the
appropriate SSH server.

Naturally, you cannot do this without access to your routers. You'll
probably have to ask your network administrator.

Thanks a lot all for your input.

But in my company they have allowed only the RDP port opened to access the machines placed in different floors.
Windows RDP client uses the port number 3389.

Hence I want to know if there is a solution to access the Fedora machine through the default RDP client in Windows without any VNC type solution as I1m not allowed to install VNC also in my Windows PC.

That's Y I was looking something like a RDP server running in Fedora @ port number 3389 and which can be accessible through Windows RDP Client.

Once again thanks and regards,
Dominic L A J S

Try to run the suggested soultions with the RDP Port number. Look into
the config files and find out the way to change the port number.

As much as we want students to learn through hands-on with the *nix
system, and we don't encourage posting of home work questions, isn't
it not fair to allow office work questions? :)

Anyways, here are some tutorials/links for a start:

My personal take on this - no issues with asking for help for 
commercial/hobby/ngo/home etc.

However, the OP should show that s/he has made some effort in trying to 
help themselves.  When OP asks for step by step procedure it shows that 
s/he has made no effort at all and expects the list members to hold 
their hands.

I also suspect some of them make commitments (that they are not capable 
of delivering) to their employers/clients and land themselves into a 
soup and then we see requests for step by step procedure.

Subject: [Ilugc] kmail woes again
Message-ID: <200912111228.55163.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

as mentioned recently kmail stopped quoting my messages so I had to delete the 
kmailrc to get the functionality back. Some time ago I had to associate 
identities with folders, and in this message:

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc/49664/match=kmail

I was given this advice:
<snip>
Presumably, you are filtering your messages from your various accounts 
to their respective folders (I do it with 4 accounts).   Now right 
click on these folders, go to property and associate that folder with 
the respective email identity.  Now, select the message folder and 
select "compose", the mail identity associated with that folder will be 
used.  I use a couple of mail ids for the various mailing lists and 
this feature works very well for me.  (It KMail 1.9.9 stock openSUSE 
11.0)

</snip>

I am using kmail in fedora 11 (version 1.11.4) and when I right click on a 
folder, there is nothing in which to associate it with the email identity. It 
was there in the earlier version of kmail - or is my copy of kmail b0rked? 
Anyway now mail 'To' any identity goes to the appropriate folder, but 
'Envelope to' does not.

Thanks ramesh for your quick response. The link which you pointed shows the
difference in date and not the time.

             I am look for a command to fetch the time from one to another.
For ex. say Dec 11, 05:30 p.m IST to  10:30 p.m IST.

Karthik

pointed to abc.net MX. due to that mails are start bouncing so that i have
reverted back.

Let me get this straight. You have an MX record at some node and you
also have a CNAME record at the same node? Can't be done. See:
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034>, search for '[Page 14]' (without
the quotes).

add re director in your source domain name. just a simple html header will
do that.

Did you try booting the live CD and mounting the partition from there ?
 If the contents are still intact and not corrupted you can just restore the
grub by typing the following in the terminal
1. $ sudo fdisk -l
Find the root(/) partition of your Ubuntu , it will be something like
/dev/sda1 or sda2 .... Eg. Lets say it was /dev/sda4
2. $ sudo grub
    grub> root(hd0,3)
    grub> setup(hd0)
Now grub will be restored and you can reboot.Hope it solved the problem

We are looking for open to full-time or contract basis but will confirm based on signing on the project.

Please do send me an email if you have the skills and are willing to work on this. 

We are always looking for full time Liferay and/or Java developers.

Thanks,
kc

Hi

Has any College has implemented FOSS as an elective/core paper in their
syllabus. As part of the FOSS club at the campus(http://foss.amrita.ac.in)
we was interested in helping advocate FOSS as an elective. We were also
interested in promoting use of FOSS tools in labs (mysql instead of oracle,
wireshark etc.) .We have Ubuntu installed on all machines, though we need
students to use tools on them as well and faculty need to learn how to use
them.

If so, could you please give the details of syllabus/other details. And
suggestions in how to carry this forward are welcome.

Well, use dd to copy your drive as is to some other location (perhaps an
external hard-drive?). Then copy your partition table separately. Then
try using testdisk or something. If that fails you can still try
grepping your drive for the files (assuming they're text).

Whatever you do, don't mess with what you have without backing up your
drive as it is.

Personally, I believe testdisk is your best bet. It's saved me from
similar situations.

No easy way to upgrade core pieces like that. What issues did you have
with Fedora 12? Maybe I could help solve that instead.

     1.I installed nvidia driver(yum install kmod-nvidia) and after that the 
entire system was crashed.I m using AMD tuticorn 64x2 and Nvidia graphics 
card.It works well with fedora 11.
     2.During the first login itself i got a kernel crash log.
     3.The network manager applet doesnt work for mobile internet connection.
It is able to connect only one time after restarting the machine.I couldnt 
able to downgrade it using yum.

Fedora 12 uses Nouveau by default and Nvidia proprietary driver
conflicts with it. I hope Nvidia fixes that sometime but meanwhile, you
can read

http://rpmfusion.org/Howto/nVidia

>      2.During the first login itself i got a kernel crash log.

This is probably a reference to kernel oops which is different from a
kernel crash. We have Abrt (automatic bug reporting tool) installed by
default in Fedora 12 to provide these oopses to kerneloops.org to
improve the quality of Linux kernel. This is general QA measure. If you
don't have the utility installed, oopses are logged only to
/var/log/messages. Oopses generally are not a serious issue.

Well, the GA version will be the oldest version available in the
repository and hence cannot be downgraded via yum. If a update caused a
issue, you can rollback to the previous version via yum downgrade.

What mobile connection are using? What wireless do you have?

That card works fine in Fedora 11?  Can you fetch the messages in
/var/log/messages from a failed connection?

If you can, try the Live CD and see if that works. The Nvidia
proprietary driver issue is solvable as I indicated earlier.

I Use EVDO on ubuntu and it works "on the fly". No additional configuration
required. The Network Manager automatically detects it.
Otherwise, there is program called "wvdial" which automatically configures
the modem, all  you have to do is enter your username and password. The only
drawback is you may not get a good as a GUI as you do if you install your
drivers in Windows where you can check Max Speed. But that is a small
sacrifice for "Independence"

server is up - it is timing out for me also - in fact the whole internet is 
timing out for me for the past few days. It took me over an hour to access a 
spammed page and to look at the history and revert it - should take 2 minutes 
max!

Message-ID: <51285.122.174.129.251.1260604844.squirrel@www.songbirdtech.com>

With the recent and ongoing controversy over the "climategate" affairs,
there has been a call for open sourcing the data and the programs used for
climate research.

I believe some of this data is already out. A few questions:

1) Is anyone on this list involved in climate research? and have they
looked at this code and data?

2) Is it possible for this to be done with data obtained locally from
Indian Meteorological centres?

I think this is a research any sufficiently motivated person can handle.
After all this is basically a question of plotting a time series
(temperature vs dates) to arrive at a possible trend.

Prem

From the log file it appears that all "auth" data is in a MySQL db and 
your cgi script is not able to connect to MySQL.

Besides this, you need to fix/investigate the following first.

(a) Fix all "error" associated with "File does not exist".  Apparently 
your app. installation is b0rked.

(b) Check what kind of socket connection MySQL listens to and how your 
application is trying to connect to the MySQL engine.

e.g. MySQL conf may allow connection over 127.0.0.1 only and your cgi 
script connection may be coming from 10.100.16.183 - this is a hunch.

Thanks everyone. I'm buying the data card next week. I don't need
flashy GUIs anyway, they consume too much resources which can be used
for better purposes.

Hi,
While attempting SUSE install it offers two modes, one is partition based an the other is LVM based. What is the diff?. what is LVM actually?. LVM mode seems to offer safe solution in terms of harddisk allocations. Pls suggest.

Hi,

Firstly, don't panic. A power off during a manual fsck is not half as bad as the 
HDD dying and even then data is recoverable, as long as you don't *write* 
anything on the disk.

Here is what I would recommend:
a. Boot using a live CD/USB

b. Do /not/ mount the hdd, just do a dd of the partitions with your data onto 
some other HDD/external disk.

c. If you know/remember whether you had configured LVM on your disk (I believe 
most distros use lvm as the default), try mounting your LVM volumes:

http://specialkevin.com/?p=97
http://linuxwave.blogspot.com/2007/11/mounting-lvm-disk-using-ubuntu-livecd.html

d. If 'c' was successful (which implies that the unknown partition error might 
have to do with this fact), unmount the volumes and run a manual fsck on them 
(the LVM volumes *not* the hard disk partition). Hopefully, the data should be 
intact, worst case scenario you would have to dig through the generate 
lost+found directory, trying to guess the files:
http://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/lostfound.html
(run a 'file' on each entry and then open it with the appropriate application, 
hopefully you can recover all that you lost).

e. If you do not have LVM partitions or you partition table itself is screwed, 
try using 'rescueprt' ( http://erik.mysmt.net/rescuept.html ), it is part of the 
util-linux package, so it should be available on the Live CD. This command tries 
to identify your partition table and output's it in a format that can be 
directly sent to sfdisk to create the identified partition table.

f. If you do not have LVM partitions and but your partition table is intact. Try 
running fsck on these partitions.

Let us know what happens.

In any case, it is essential that you do 'b' above so that you retain a copy of 
the br0ked filesystem just in case none of the above worked and you want to keep 
trying other approaches.

Hope you get your data back.

cheers,
- steve

Which Linux distribution you are using, Fedora, Debian based,
yum install latex for fedora,
apt-get install latex for Debian based.

Make sure yum and apt-get work's fine.

Hi Ramya

Thanks for the reply

See, i too have a decent amount of knowledge and experience FOSS and don't
expect any faculty to teach me. It is not for me alone that we(
foss.amrita.ac.in) want to make this an elective. Not everyone may be
motivated enough like us to google(u can see that in classmates around you
itself) and find out things, and the goal is to make everyone aware of the
benefits of FOSS, and start contributing in whatever they can.

Btw, which college are you from( u never mentioned that :) ) It would be
good if you could share it, we want all possible inputs we have.

Cheers!

I am not convinced that MySQL needs any "saving" from Oracle. Oracle
acquired Innodb, one of the major db engines used in MySQL and everybody
was up in arms about it. Same with Bdb. Oracle hasn't damaged these open
source projects. I would say the jury is still out and Monty has a
vested interest in MySQL because he runs a company that is using a
forked version of MySQL called MariaDB

Guys:

This is Raja Sekhar Malapati and working with a Venture capital firm 
(Ventureast) based in Chennai.

I have recently purchased Android phone (ADP1 phone). I changed with OS 
with Cupcake's early version through one of my friend. Because of this 
(improper implementation) its signal drops continuously. So I want to 
change its OS perhaps to a stable version .. Android 2.0 ..  into it. 
Could anyone of you guys install for me?

Thanks
Raja

Where you can get "LFY's" in Chennai(maybe around Ashok Nagar)? Because
whenever i go to Higginbotham's they never seemed to have heard the name. So
that definitely rules out smaller magazine vendors :)

Try  MiKTex  (http://miktex.org/) for Tex distribution on Windoz
Texmaker is a good Latex IDE for beginners.
There are some good online tutorials at Indian Tex Users  Group

 Its great to hear, that you want to learn LAMP, but why cant you learn by
yourself. Self learning is the best. There are plenty of
tutorials/manuals/documentations available on the internet. for PHP,

Hi,
I installed ubuntu 9.10 in my desktop.
After installation and restarting, the mouse works only for nearly 10 to 15
seconds.
Then i'm not able to do anything.
I tried restarting again and the same thing happened.
How to solve this problem?

I don't have an answer, but even I am having a similar problem. Sometimes
(not very frequently), if too much of CPU is being used, like running a huge
process or copying a lot f data, then my I/O(mouse and keyboard) hangs. Just
my mouse and keyboard hangs, nothing else, the system remains fine. Has
anyone got a similar probem? Is this a bug?

Try Ubuntu 9.04 or a LiveCD of some other distro.  This will help you 
figure out if it is a software or a hardware problem.

File a bug report against 9.10 giving details of your hardware and the 
symptoms of your problem; also mention 9.04 works fine on the same 
hardware.

Did Monty seek help or solicit opinions from users when selling to Sun ?
Maybe it's easier to spread anguish than the loot ?

I believe some of this data is already out. A few questions:

No I haven't. But what I do know is that there are many public "data sets"
available online. These data sets are open for anyone to use. They can be
found in Amazon EC2 cloud, google, private sites etc..

e.g. http://www.datawrangling.com/some-datasets-available-on-the-web

Not sure if this data can be obtained from meteorological centers. But the
data should be available for download..

Yes. Its pretty complex. I still cannot wrap my mind around the fact as to
why greenhouse gases let the heat from the Sun 'in' first but wont let it go
out :-)

The consequences are, while the temp (the avg temp actually) rises on a
global scale, the local changes are unpredictable. That's why its being
referred to as climate change now rather than global warming. The
implication of avg temp rising is that the ocean and atmospheric currents go
haywire on a global scale and for all we know Chennai could end up with an
arctic tundra climate.

True.

its being referred to as climate change now rather than global warming.


Global warming is only a part. There's also a global cooling effect ! Talk
of a new Ice age !

Not sure about that. But we'll ve to be responsible citizens and not throw
garbage or burn/use plastic etc. you know all that.

Any why it's complex is the nature of the subject. Lot's of parameters, less
and more complex. And added to that, there are some data which ( in my
opinion ) not fall into the category of being a parameter at all and are
purely dependent on historical data.. e.g. behaviour of El nino, La nina
etc.. It makes it all but impossible to make projections/calculations about
future climate. That's where the public data sets come into the picture.

The algorithms are quite complex ( but not difficult or impossible ) and not
very accurate. We can only arrive at approximations most of the time. FOSS
world needs more people to be involved.. Someone should start a project
based on this.. I would suggest we follow the pattern followed by open
street maps for such a project. Anyone game ??

Hi ,
Take a look  Grads and cdo  open source tool. I have not tried it.

I don't think it would've been in the interests of Sun to kill or 
actively harm MySQL. Sun actively participated and invested in a lot of 
open source projects . But, Oracle has nothing comparable to that 
record, nor was it shy to kill off its previous acquisitions like Siebel 
and JD Edwards. So I think Monty's fears are well-founded.

Who said so? Not sure whether you know :
http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/open-source/index.htm
SIebel/JD Edawards/PeopleSoft Entreprise Suites are still supported and new
releases being launched.  (IF i am right, PeopleSoft HCM was launched in Sep
2009 and so is the case with the other Suites).

OTOH, every product has a life cycle. I wont be a spokesperson for any
company as such, but as far i have seen, all the  acquisitions, whomsoever
it might be, undergo 'transformations' or 'integrations'. At the end of the
day some products die (for eg. del.icio.us by Y!) whereas some go onto
become kickass product(GEarth). Remeber that SeaDragon by M$ is yet to
become 'big' whereas the acquisition happened years ago. BerkeleyDB is still
a kicka$$ product and is still open sourced and is developed/supported
actively. The Oracle Technology Network(OTN) is extremely active and is
supported very nicely.

The product life cycle is more apparent in bigger products/companies.
Moreover, in the Enterprise segment, the ball game is NOT  the same as
developing a 'website' or a widget. I work on a product that is 15-20 years
old and have seen it change with the evolving technologies. From some
neanderthal era to the best h/w and s/w technologies and it continues to
evolve.

Basically, acquisitions/consolidation is bound to happen whichever space it
might be. Accepting it and trudging along and devicing a suitable game plan
is to be every project's strategy. You should remember Linus's comment on M$
and take things in the true spirit of technology.

Why would you say del.icio.us is dead?  I still use it, so do lots of
people I know.

Also it's interesting that while you say M$, you don't call it Ora?le,
or Oracl?  :)

Yes, I said nothing "comparable" - contributing some money to some 
FOSS-related foundations, and supporting existing projects, doesn't come 
anywhere near wholly embracing open source as a central business 
strategy like Sun did (and spending enormous resources and creating and 
maintaining new ones). So you have to admit that Sun was any day a 
better home to MySQL than Oracle is.

Sure, Oracle might put out small upgrades and give required support to 
existing customers over that platform - but for good or bad, they don't 
push Siebel products or JD Edwards anymore. Let's face it, the primary 
motive behind acquiring those companies is to neutralize competition, 
and they have been very effective at doing that. And there is absolutely 
no guarantee that they wouldn't try to do that to MySQL.

I'm sure there are good hearted FOSS-loving folks at Oracle. But in 
MySQL's case unfortunately, it's not just any FOSS project - one that 
could very well kill the lower to mid-end of Oracle's market. And we're 
supposed to believe that Oracle's shareholders/executives will let that 
happen?

As for devising a plan, one need not do that, actually - open source 
projects will obliterate Oracle - it's just a matter of time. If not 
MySQL, probably MongoDB. Or something else. Let's face it - Oracle is 
already a dinosaur. We're just trying to protect a well-loved bunny 
called MySQL from it - whatever the fate of the bunny, the dinosaur will 
be done for, sooner or later :)

Vamsee.

I think both are different strategies for OSS. And OSS needs both. Kind
without Money is no use.

COMPLETELY WRONG. Check out the feature list before commenting. PeopleSoft
HCM and other suites are getting some BIG makeovers. Siebel CRM is being
adopted in a big way. These acquisitions were targeted before Oracle Fusion
for their own strategic reasons.

I hope you noticed that PPLSoft's HCM release in Sep'09 was done despite the
fact that Fusion is around the corner; this itself would convey loads.

I dont understand FOSS, have *always* reserved my comments in this Forum on
OSS alone.

Sure, that's *another* perspective too.

IMHO (and lets face it with an open mind): Oracle's DB technology is
lightyears ahead of the other solutions in the market and i am not sure how
many lightyears it will take for others to reach that stature/customer base.

All for good.

Hi,

It is not obuntu. :-)

it is ubuntu.

You can connect to vpn in ubuntu linux easily.

A simple google search as "vpn client in ubuntu" will give you a lot
links and help.

Here is a nice link.

It's weird timing this, since I spent an idle hour looking at
comparisons of MySQL and Oracle yesterday.  From what I read, it seems
that while MySQL will suffice for most database needs, it's not even
in the same league as commercial offerings in terms of features,
stability etc.

The spread of RDBMS offerings seems to be something like this:

SQLite
 |
MySql
 |
PostgreSQL
 |
...
 |
MS SQLServer (and others, I think Firebug?)
 |
...
 |
Oracle

The ellipses signifying that they're miles ahead of the competition.
The articles I read were not from FOSS proponents, but rather from
DBAs evaluating whether to use MySQL or Oracle, and the consensus (in
the small sampling I checked out) was that MySql was ideal (because of
pricing) for most needs, but Oracle was worth every penny (shocking
considering howmany gazillion pennies it costs) if you need the
features it provides.

I don't have links now, but someone had claimed that the free
alternatives are where Oracle was 20 years ago.

Anyways, I'm way out of my depth, it's still fresh in my mind since I
happened to read up on this while checking out some new music
yesterday.

I'm assuming that's a question - if it is, then I'm not sure I'm 
qualified to answer that - but just from a user/web developer 
perspective, I would personally prefer postgresql in my projects, but 
for various reasons (the major one being, I believe, easy replication - 
makes it easier to scale) - MySQL has more or less become the default 
choice for web development (that uses open source tools).

People don't choose postgresql unless they have good reasons to do so. 
So I believe, the battle on that front has already been lost - I still 
agree that postgresql is many ways much better than mysql - but some 
features that mysql has make is the easy choice rather than postgresql. 
I guess it's just being at the right place at the right time. But now, 
the age of the RDBMS is about to be over (at least for startups - 
enterprise will continue to use it for a few more decades I'm sure).

So we have the whole NoSQL movement and key-values stores, and MongoDB 
provides a go-between - it retains some RDBMS features, in spite of 
being a key-value store too. So I think, the future lies over there. 
Hard to say, but that's just a hunch. Plus, MongoDB already has drivers 
for pretty much all popular languages out there. So I guess it's only a 
matter of time.

Vamsee.

Can you provide some more clarification on whether
1. you wish the MP3 player to support running Linux OS on it, or
2. you just want to sync/connect the mp3 player to the computer running
linux?

- If its the first option, look at  http://www.linuxfordevices.com/
- for the later, check out http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9266 ,
http://www.gtkpod.org/about.html (ipods). you may have more apps which can
sync with/manage your devices.

thanks

Okay, I feel a flame coming on - apologies in advance :). Ah, I'm not so 
sure - there are plenty of projects that survive without taking Oracle's 
or some other corporate entity's money. Yes, obviously industry drives 
adoption, and there should always be synergy - but I don't think any 
open source project will die just for the lack sponsorship of a big 
corporate entity. That's not their raison d'etre.

I don't know man. I don't know or care about Oracle's product map or how 
much of it constitutes FOSS. I don't think I cared about the company 
since my college days. Isn't that kind of the point? That the company 
has no relevance to this audience?

Sure, the banks and credit card processors who need it maybe will fork 
over the truckloads of money if they think they're getting the value. If 
so, sure. So if Oracle is indeed light years ahead, why bother about a 
puny, hobbled open source database used by, I don't know, millions of 
tiny websites? What value can MySQL possibly hold for the cash-munching 
super-advanced db technology company? ;-)

Message-ID: <69621d830912132310y74ac12e2ib8ffca6a1b0e0c3b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, i want to increase my swap space in my Debian 5.0 server. And, after
googling i found that, there is something called "creating swap *file"* to
increase swap space. So, i followed that in my test machine to increase 512
Megabyte with 2 Giga swap space. So, what i did:

commands:
*
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=512k count=1024
mkswap /swap
chmod 0600 /swap
swapon /swap
*
Also included this line in /etc/fstab:
*
/swap swap swap defaults 0 0*

And, at last :  *free -m

*After everything swapon -s gave me the result:

Filename                                Type            Size    Used
Priority
/dev/sda6                               partition       1967920 0       -1
/swap                                       file                524280
0       -2

*Now, my question is: does it actually increased my swap space?*

Is there any desktop app or a widget with which I can continuously monitor

Tried google desktop .. No good. Also tried "Grism" no good either.
Currently using "Stockr" firefox addon. ( Which is good!) But desperately

It is quite disheartening when people compare closed source
proprietary products with Free/Open Source Software products, where
the fundamental principle or ideology that we believe in sharing of
source code, and knowledge doesn't exist in the former, and there is
_no_ room for comparison at all!

You can never compare a corrupt politician (who hides everything), and
an honest (gives the source) public servant.

Even worse, is when newbies ask for 'alternatives/equivalents' in the
F/OSS world, than appreciate the freedom of the source code, and what
they can do with it. Sad, but true.

Few hints:

I would love to correct your program, but would advice you to google. There
are some advantages of this: You willl stumble on something interesting
during the course of your searh which would be a good hack experiment. For
eg, the Q that you have asked is a very fundamental Q and there are truck
loads of informations all around.

Also, as of now you have not been thinking about non-english characters ,
and probably you might have to accomodate that in the future - how will you
handle it then?

Also, you might want want to check whether there are any already
existing *nix commands that can help you in here.

(this is one is on the programming style) Also, the special characters list
can increase or decrease in the future, do you want to change it all over
the program? Is there a better paradigm by which you can do this?

-V-
PS: Sending code to a mailing list wouldnt be a good move, especially if
your code exceeds n lines(n>10 , according to me).

Bash variables start with alphabets, not special characters.

Instead of ?=0, you can use something like Q=0. Instead of ?++, use
Q++. And finally, echo "Q = $Q".

+1 * 1024 !

It always surprises me when F/OSS aware people start comparing proprietary 
alternatives to F/OSS software. Here I am not even going with what Shakthi said 
about the 'ideology' -- Open source even purely as a development model just 
makes sound sense !

As a small/medium sized business it just becomes more easier to 
own/control/customize an Open Source product than bother with having to convince 
behemoths like Oracle to include the feature/bug fix/customization you require !

If you have doubts, ask Red Hat(*) !

All that said, I don't feel overly concerned about the Oracle acquisition. The 
nature of the open source software development model is the built-in fault 
tolerance. Good FOSS survives acquisition (eg: Netscape), missing maintainers 
(too many to list -- but just as a thought experiment, do you really think linux 
will die with Linus's death ?), veiled attacks (eg: SCO's attack) and any other 
faults !

Once free, you can bet that software will survive if it is any good.

cheers,
- steve

There is no proprietary driver available for Sony or Apple, but it works
with Rythmbox http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/.
I have done it myself. All you have to do is similar to Itunes, Just drag
and drop from library.

I tried all the three Distros and they got installed nicely. However, there is a peculiar problem: When I entered 'Yast' in the Search Box, Archive Manager opened up instead of Yast and I couldn't proceed further. However, when I selected Yast from Applications, it worked! Can anybody throw light on this?
Thanks and regards.

Bash variables start with alphabets, not special characters.
Instead of ?=0, you can use something like Q=0. Instead of ?++, use
Q++. And finally, echo "Q = $Q".

That is exactly what the mentioned does:

* [ "$c" == "?" ] && (( Q++ )), increments the variable Q for every

If you are using the GNOME desktop environment, you can add the 'invest' applet 
to the panel. It is quite likely that your distro. already packages the invest 
applet as part of the default applet set. Docs for the invest applet are here:

I shall highly appreciate your help rendered in resolving this issue. However, the result to be displayed on the screen shoudl be such that the number of repetition of special characters should be  displayed/ indicated on the screen alongwith alphabets. like A,G,C,T,?,-, *......etc.
sometimes there may be an empty space between  two characters. Hence, I had to modify at the end as echo "$? or $* = $P or $Q"
The end result to be displayed on the screen shall be:
A=57
G=43
C=16
T=12
?=8
-=14
*=9 .....etc.....
With thanks & regards

Hi,
Thanks 4 the suggestion. Tried that applet. But I'm not sure if it works for
Indian stock markets like BSE NSE etc. Also it's not near real time. It's
source is Yahoo. And the applet says the info  gets delayed by 15 mins.

Thanks.

Where you can get "LFY's" in Chennai(maybe around Ashok Nagar)? Because
whenever i go to Higginbotham's they never seemed to have heard the name. So
that definitely rules out smaller magazine vendors :)

Hello friends,

One professor in Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Mathematical studies
needs support in emacs speak.  she worked earlier with emacs speak
under ubuntu and due to some reason her machine went down. She is my
wife's professor at University of Madras.  I learned from my wife that
her professor is a genie of mathematics who suffers from acute visual
impairment.

The professor stays at IIT-Madras campus  and she would be available
on 26th December 2009. People who worked/interested  with emacs speak
can assist this professor, kindly mail me offline.

Thanks in advance,

Besides Google uses mysql for adwords and had evaluated many
proprietary databases to see if they could find a replacement. They
have also released their mysql tools as well under a FOSS license.
Much of proprietary software is marketed/sold with misinformation/FUD.
Please check your facts before making sweeping statements about OSS.

Message-ID: <582fce4d0912140629p214ec451mdea6e72e01b28e71@mail.gmail.com>

I've installed Karmic Koala on a Dell Inspiron 640M. For the sake of some
Windows specific software (trading software), I tried Wine 1.2 that came
with the distro and it did not work. I installed VirtualBox 3.1, WinXP Home
that was licenced for this laptop.

Ubuntu works well with the 1440x900 resolution. Under VBox, a particular
game reports Direct3D has not been enabled. On checking the drivers, found
no proprietary drivers loaded. Synaptics showed Mesa7.6 (latest) installed
and Vbox has 3D acceleration enabled.

Questions:
1. Can Direct3D support be enabled with the regular vesa driver?
2. I've downloaded the latest Intel GMA Linux driver source. Has anyone used
this on Koala? Any downsides?

Message-ID: <413d65e90912140631j7b818b95p70a5565e7e1c77b9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am running Virtualbox 3.1 on Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala i386 arch. I have
created a virtual machine using a Chromium OS .vdi file as the hard disk.

Previously, I was not able to log in and was getting the message "Network
not connected and offline login fail". I searched this up, and the problem
was that my virtual interface was not in bridged fashion.

Once I configured it in bridged mode, now the error message does not come
up, but the whole VM hangs. There is no blank screen or anything, it just
hangs in the login screen after I enter my google user credentials and press
"Enter". I have searched up a bit, but haven't been successful in solving
*this* problem. Has anyone tried this? Any suggestions?

This application uses java 6. First you have to install java 6 in your
machine.

Check the following links for installing java.
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/install/jdk/install-linux.html
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

Then

1.Download the zip file from the jstock download page.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Run jstock.sh. It will start the application.

If it throws any error like 'bash: ./jstock.sh: /bin/bash^M: bad
interpreter:' in step 3. Run the following command.
dos2unix jstock.sh

Hi,
We have installed Ubuntu in one of our computers and the same is running 
successfully for the past two months. Now we have decided to use it in 
the rest of the computers. We need a person who can install it in our 
computers and configure it for our use.

Actually, i am running dspace server that. This is an institutional

The card is not powerful enough to support Direct3D under Virtualbox. Even
native OpenGL support is is rather bad under Linux.

In Ubuntu by default you are not running vesa drivers, but rather the
accelerated Intel drivers present in Xorg -- check if you are running
desktop effects for the presence of acceleration.

Intel has no proprietary drivers for Xorg (except for Poulsbo which is
found only in a few gimped netbooks). What is in Xorg is all that is
offered. What you downloaded from Intel's site is probably a few weeks
newer that what is available in Ubuntu. So you probably wont notice a
great difference in performance.

I have an Intel Intel  GM965  onboard graphics card.

Intel has changed the setting up the graphics mode from X.org to the kernel
in Karmic
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/KernelModeSetting

This enabled me to run quite a few games on Wine with OpenGL support on
Karmic without having to download the latest source. I had no issues, though
i have not tested it out on Virtualbox.

Any modern distro has OpenJDK (which passes the Java TCK) JRE installed by
default with JDK available in the repositories. So why still point to the
sun download site to install a version which will be poorly integrated
with the rest of the system?

And why do you think adding more swap will make dspace
any faster?

Thanks for the information.

I don't know that most of the modern distro has OpenJDK. Checked with fedora
11 and it is working fine with the default java.

Hi,
    More on the same, RMS and other's letter to EC on why Oracle
should not be permitted to acquire MySQL.

http://www.keionline.org/ec-mysql

Has a lot of valid points against the acquisition.

I posted this once before but I didn't see it appear on ilugc. In case it
did appear, please do excuse this duplicate post.

With the recent and ongoing controversy over the "climategate" affairs,
there has been a call for open sourcing the data and the programs used for
climate research.

I believe some of this data is already out. A few questions:

1) Is anyone on this list involved in climate research? and have they
looked at this code and data?

2) Is it possible for this to be done with data obtained locally from
Indian Meteorological centres?

I think this is a research any sufficiently motivated person can handle.
After all this is basically a question of plotting a time series
(temperature vs dates) to arrive at a possible trend.

Prem

hi,
   i don't know how to increase swap space in debian, but i can guide u for
RedHat Linux..

1. check the status of ur swap by ( swapon -s )
2.create one partition with swap id ( size- according to ur requirements )
3.Make ur swap off ( swapoff -a)
4.mkswap -L  swap1  /dev/sda7 ( here -L option for label, and the labelname
is swap1, /dev/sda7 is the new swap partition which is going to be added )
5. put entry in /etc/fstab like this:
  LABEL=swap1       swap1         swap         defaults          0 0
6. save it, refresh /etc/fstab
     mount   -a ( to refresh /etc/fstab)
7.make swap on ( swapon -a)
8. check status ( swapon -s)
this will display two partion in ur swap space with different priority
number.
9. give ( free ) command to check ur swap space
10. for MB, use ( free -m)

RHCE is quite a tough test (compared to other certs where there is just a
"fill in the right option") and is fully hands on. Hence, it is recognized
all over and it would improve your employability considerably. You may know
that you are good linux admnistrator, but how else would you prove this to
your employer?
Also, since the test is quite costly, make sure you are well prepared the
first time.
A red hat employee once told me that the certs are one of their alternate
sources of funding because 70% people usually get through only on the 2nd
attempt:)

1. If one has written scripts/automation tools, and released under a
F/OSS license, please provide the source or repository URL.

2. If one has been part of a F/OSS project where you have worked with
Infrastructure activities (Fedora Infrastructure [1], for example),
please provide references to tickets that you have handled.

3. If one has been involved in online support/forum discussions, refer
the problems that you helped or solved to prove your knowledge.

4. If one has helped setup systems, LAN, servers in a community event
or lab or college or any other organization, please provide
references.

5. If one has written documentation that is simple, easy to read,
comprehend, and doesn't make any assumptions, please provide the
sources.

6. If one writes something in their resume, make sure that you really,
really know what you have written, rather than just copy-paste skills
from other resumes or online sources, because, it is pretty
straight-forward to tell the difference.

>From interviewing "certified" candidates for the last five years, I
have decided not to pick any, for their lack of hands-on experience,
and the lack of curiosity or enthusiasm to seek more knowledge, and be
up-to-date with technology, know-how, and skills.

Thats interesting. :D
Given that a lot of colleges that conduct the exams have to switch,
I wonder if this will also increase the no. of FOSS installs in college
labs.

Hi,
   my thought about certificate is not like this, its true that many person
who have certificate but doesn't have any knowledge.....Many people who has
written certification exam are force to write because the companies are
asking for that, especially freshers....

even i have seen many people who is experienced but doesn't have that much
knowledge.....freshers are force to write certification exam not by their
will but for getting job.....no body like to spend money for certificate,
but during interview they have to compete the people....

even i m also against these certification, i m also a fresher and have done
RHCE, after completing my certification i didn't find that my knowledge have
increased in one day, i m studying Linux every day, finding the real time
problems from ILUGC and then trying to implement it and finding the
solution, linux is like that until u will not face problem, u cannot learn
it properly or cannot understand why the problem has occur....

Linux is very vast, a fresher doesn't know from where to start and few
people r there to help them in learning linux, doing free lancing is not
easy for everyone.....My suggestion is that people should have to learn by
their own interest and the companies those who r providing certificate in
linux, should have to provide a good text, which should contain a brief
explanation and shouldn't make the certification as business..


I also request ILUGC to come forward and to talk with universities, college
and also diploma colleges to go with open source.....I also request
knowledgeable person to come to forward to provide at least one day seminar
in diploma and engineering colleges......

The problem is that many colleges doesn't have good staff to guide them, so
many students are loosing their interest and many doesn't know abt open
source...

ILUGC is always willing to help in this. We are coming forward. But we need college and students support. Please talk to colleges you know and arrange for seminar/workshop/what_ever_you_call_it and contact us. We will provide all the technical help.

Update:

1. Ubuntu 9.1 forms Xorg.conf on the fly and so I was not able to find a
config file. From the logs found that Intel is the chosen driver.
2. Beginning kernel version 2.6.30, the modeset is enabled by default.
3. OpenGL and mesa7.6 are installed by default during installation.
4. Compiz with all effects works well and so does Counterstrike with either
OpenGL or D3D video.

a. Having done this, was sure the problem was in VBox.
b. Reading up showed that D3D to OpenGL translation is done by WineD3D which
need to be used in VMs for D3D support.
c. Downloaded the pre-built binaries for windows and installed them in the
safe mode in the Guest Windows OS.
d. Ran dxdiag and the utility crashed when D3D was checked.

Many on the net say they've got D3D support work this way. Did not for me.
Any pointers? :-(

May be vmstat can help,

$ while true; do vmstat 1 2 | tail -1 | awk '{print $13+$14;}'; done

13th field in vmstat will give overall user% and 14th field will give 
ovrall system%. Above commandline will print overall cpu% until you

@Subhojit
You just posted my thoughts in my mind.

People without certification always criticize the people with certification(
Do you know why? because they are scared of taking up the exam and Majority
of the people are not certified . Majority won blindly. ).
According to me anyone can configure a squid or apache . do you think the
howto's available in the internet is not enough to configure those servers.
?

The recruiter should understand and look  freshers with certification  in a
positive way . we are not trying  to prove that we are well stuffed than the
realtime experience people. we are trying to show that we have interest in
that field. We are ready to groom ourself in that field. Atleast you people
should respect  RHCE . It is a performance based one.
why dont you people give an system to the candidate ask him to configure
some server are what ever tasks. An RHCE student will willingly take up than
people with 1 yr experience . Because those people never configured servers
without documentation .  we configured 6 to 7 servers and 13 tasks within 3
and half hours ( without documentation that too under time and money
pressure ).

here is the reply for all the recruiters and interview panel guys
1) Just think what type of question you are asking to the student ? you
people are asking questions what you know. To achieve an task there are 100
of ways and 100 of commands . Stop asking about commands and their flags .
just try to find how much the candidate is interested in this field and how
much he is up to date in the filed. If you really want good student go for
performance based interview. Ask questions concept based like what is NAT?
or how will you implement NAT in linux?  Dont expect the exact command with
flags and arguments (It shows stupidity). Because we are not going to
dictate commands and flags to the system.

A request to all the students taking up certification. Go for certification
,surely you will be respected if you are good in your  curriculum .Practice
as much as possible.  Smart work with Hard work always pays . Always respect
your certification. If you respect your certification automatically you will
start studying more about your certification curriculum . One day you will
achieve :)

If you feel my tone is aggressive sorry for that.

Xen support full virtualization only with native virtualization ( intel -VT
or AMD -v)
check  whether your processor supports native(Hardware supported )
virtualization in their website. If yes then you can go for full
virtualization . Lets me know if you need any more help in xen.

Not sure about others, but, I always do the above. We call it

Hi,

ubuntu 9.10 comes with an excellent RAD GUI development framework
called "quickly".

It is a wonderful combo of python+gtk+glade+couchdb


http://rickspencer3.com/quickly-getting-started.html

http://rickspencer3.com/quickly-dialogs.html

these links are little old but can give you a overview of the framework.

install quickly and get the full documentation and tutorial in your own box.

Its just an discussion sharing each other views . If it goes to flame war i
wont continue this. i will give assurance to you.

Whats wrong in configuring server with documentation and what great about
configuring without Documentation?

Nothing  great :)
   I mentioned that just to say some of the positive points.  Thats the same
thing i like to pin point. Dont simply ask just conduct some bootcamp like
Mr . Sakthi Kannan .
Today people expecting exact answers  . If one guy says immediately then he
is more preferred than other one who says i will refer the documentation .
Even though 2nd guy has knowledge on wide range of topics.

I always recommend  documentation because i didnt write that coding ,it is
written by lots of people around the world.

Actually i want to  discuss about how IT infrastructure domain  and
certifications are  flawed when it comes to freshers recruitment.

hi,
how does one resolve conflicts in mercurial? In subversion one just edits the 
file and then do svn resolve filename and it is resolved. This does not seem to 
work in mercurial - and I find the docs unclear also. I notice two files on a 
resolve - one is marked .orig. Whatever I do the hg reports merge failure. Any 
tips?

You can manually fix the file that has the resolve conflict, and then do:

  $ hg resolve -m <filename>

There is "A worked example" here:

NIIT nungambackam has good facility for CCNA Lab.But I would suggest you just to enroll for CCNA and study online and books provided by cisco.The classes at NIIT may not be much effective for you as they go very fast.

Dont waste your money for certifications training  like CCNA. The training
centers are totally waste in india except 1 or 2 .

I request you to go through CCNA Tod lammle book and practice with  Cisco
Packet Tracer . This tool is much more better than crappy routers present in
the Training Institues. Even you can do packet level tracing thats the thing
which attracted me most :).

Never think in a way that completing CCNA will get you a job. You have to
work hard and hard. Virtually you can learn anything from the internet.
Learn by thinking logically.
So take a brilliant decision.

Hi Zico,
I guess you know already that increasing the swap space doesn't
increase the performance of your system dramatically as it is just a
part of the hard disk though it may act as RAM. But there is a limit
to the amount of swap you can use above which the extra space is not
used. This is I think twice the RAM capacity. So if you seriously
think of improving your performance then try investing in a bigger
RAM.

hi,

I am happy to announce that we have at long last launched the Foss Web 
Deployment Engineer Certification. 'The first question that will arise is: 
'Kenneth of all people is launching a certification? he must be fit to be 
certified'.  True. To date I have never looked at a candidate's certificates 
when interviewing him - as I know how easy these things are to crack and that 
mugging up is no guarantee that the person actually *knows* anything. For the 
last three years we have been working to set up a certification that tests FOSS 
ability - rather than memory or exam writing skills. We feel that we have 
achieved this. The certification is endorsed by the GOI and Anna University, so 
the paper may be worth something - but I feel the value of the certification is 
that anyone who attempts it - pass or fail - will imbibe some of the spirit of 
FOSS and be more employable (and a better person).

I wish to thank those members of this and other mailing lists for contributing 
their ideas, time and effort to this. I also request all of you to contribute 
to the forums and answer questions there. Those of you who have companies that 
use FOSS tools or train FOSS people are requested to register their companies 
on the site. And give feedback on the skills you require. There is a nominal 
fee of Rs 100 for registration - that is to keep the viagra salesmen out, and 
also to test out our online payment system - we are one of the first government 
educational institutions to have an online payment system - and probably the 
only certifying authority in the world which has the whole source code of it's 
website online and freely downloadable. And that includes the code for the 
online payment itself.

The site is still in an experimental stage - so please be kind and report 
errors and omissions.

Message-ID: <903a0c640912160146u75d1223di3c2283704805e3af@mail.gmail.com>

To start the career in Cisco / Networking.. CCNA is the base.

   1. CCNA(Cisco Certified Network Associate) can be written as a single
   exam  or can be split into two. ICND 1(CCENT) and ICND 2. after completing
   ICND 2. the CCNA is achieved.
   2. The cost for every exam in cisco world wont be less than 12,000.
   (Depends upon dollar rate).
   3. Most of the questions will be logical and situation based. there will
   be atleast 2 simulation based questions.
   4. Practice.. practice.. a lot. on routers.  Do NOT mug-up the commands
   without practicing them.
   5. To try hands-on the routers. there are three choices-


   - Buy your own router.. checkout the used cisco routers prices on ebay..
   - Join some training center.  In Chennai Sams Bound is the best.
   - Download GNS3 and simulate the routers. see.. http://gns3.net/ - The
   best way..


Lots of books are available on CCNA.. I would recommend 'Tod Lammle' Sybex
publication.

I would recommend self-study using the sybex book.. and practicing them
using GNS3.

Message-ID: <7d447c950912160203ra7e1b75u3348fc80a3cf06db@mail.gmail.com>

I have been facing this issue since I upgraded to Ubuntu 9.10.
The audio output does comes through both the speaker and the Mic
when the headphones are connected.

I tried to change a few settings with not much luck. I am using Compaq
nx6110 model laptop.

Please do let me know if there are any workarounds for this.

Looks like the issue is resolved, here is what I tried.

I installed gnome-alsamixer
Since the pulse audio is default I had to explicitly open the
gnome-alsamixer via the command line
There is an option called Headphone Jack Sense, enable that and the issue
should be resolved.

I have recently learned how to program in C. I could possibly be of use in  
this custom distro. But only if i can work from home and its open source.

There is an article in Redhat KB about swap partition size when having
high amounts of RAM such as 32GB etc.

8GB is waste unles you are using 64 bit OS.

Message-ID: <4B28FFD4.3010907@fedoraproject.org>

Hi,

Omega is a completely free and open source Linux based operating system
and a Fedora remix suitable for desktop and laptop users. It is a
installable Live image for regular PC (i686 architecture) systems. It
has all the features of Fedora and number of additional software
including multimedia players and codecs by default. Omega plays any
multimedia content (including MP3) or commercial DVD's out of the box.
It also has the full Openoffice.org office suite plus extra utilities
and games.

Omega (Boxer) release is a remix of Fedora 12 and includes all the
updates till Monday 14th of December 2009 from Fedora, RPM Fusion and
Livna repositories.  Adobe repository is also enabled by default for
convenience but no software is installed from that repository by default.

It is a 1.3 GB Live image and you can simply use dd in Linux or the
cross platform Fedora Live USB creator to create a Live USB.

Download it from

http://omega.dgplug.org/

Thanks to the entire Fedora community.

I am using koha 3.0.4 under debian 5.0. The problem is in editing records.
If we edit any records, after editing, it shows two same records, both are
newly edited records.

After that, if we delete one item and if we search for that in OPAC; the
error shows:

*Koha error
The following fatal error has occurred:

it never works. The resolve goes through but commit says 'unmerged changes - 
cannot commit' and merge says 'uncommitted changes merge failure'. this has 
happened several times.

Hi,

I am trying to scrap the website 'http://service.ringcentral.com'

It has a form with three input boxes.

When trying to get the form with mechanize, it is throwing the
following error.

mechanize._mechanize.FormNotFoundError: no form matching name 'login'

but, the page has the form with name "login".

This form is submitted by javascript.

Need your help to fill the form and login to that site using python
+mechanize.

My code is pasted here.

Thanks.

Just curious;not for-or-against certifications.

What are options for a would be linux professional?

One could scream around about his interests or skills but on what
basis do you decide.

I am not against certifications, either. Just that people have been
using it as a pretext for attributing it as _the_ credential.

Having the basic desire or curiosity to learn, think, reason, and
question why things work/fail -- the very essence of a hacker culture.

1. Be passionate about your interests. If you are not, find something which
you are really really interested in. You need to love what you do, and if
you already do that, money, fame, jobs , increments will follow. Your
passion  will show up to your prospective employer while they interview you
and also later with your deliverables . This not only applies for if you
want to be a Linux Professional, but in general.

2.  If you CHOOSE to be a Linux Professional based on your interests and
passion, welcome to the great and open world of opportunities and land of
self learning and collaboration. Start reading documents, get the  books
which give you introduction and insight  on the technologies you are
interested in. There is wide range of resources freely available.

3. Play around with your system. Try installing various distros, learning
tools, utilities, applications, doing cool things with your system. GPL'ed
software gives you the power to use it, learn it, play around with it,
modify however you want and also share the cool stuff with your friends.

4. And here is the best part. FOSS is all about collaboration. Choose a open
source project of your interest,  start learning about it, test it and start
contributing if you like. There is no one who will stop you from doing it,
and you dont need to be in a job to do this.  You will get to interact  with
the people from all over the world who have years of experience and
expertise on the technologies of your interest. You would benefit
tremendously and improve on your technical skill just hanging around with
the experts. Also you'll get to see how different people approach the same
problem, different styles of working, coding styles etc. You can pick and
choose whatever you like and evolve as you go.

5. Be on the mailing lists, irc channels, attend events, interact with
people. Get visibility while you do so. One's who are contributing well, and
are smart enough get recommended and do not even need to do certifications
etc.


If you do all this, I can personally guarantee you that you will end up with
good work and also enough money.  You may also get lucky and find a mentor
who could personally guide you in the right direction.



I clearly see two groups here, one is the experienced professionals, most of
whom are recruiters as well, who have interviewed the certified
professionals and are really unhappy with the quality and have lost the
trust on the certifications.  Second  group is the freshers who think if
they do certifications , they have better chance at getting jobs.

In crux, for the second group, Certifications may give you better chances of
landing up with a job as a fresher than not having one.  But that will
happen only if you have passion for your work, and have taken efforts to
learn things on your own while doing the certifications and if you are
thorough with it. If you believe you will mug for a few days, pass the
certification exams successfully , and suddenly will be preferred for a job,
think again.  Certification or no certification, your knowledge, passion and
soft skills is what will get you a job. This is what your prospective
employers will look in you.   My personal advise is, if you choose to do a
certification, its a good thing, but you should spend time and efforts
learning what you will. Its the journey that will matter not the destination
alone.


Thanks

  I learned a little about scrapy, scraping and web crawling framework,
which has spider-monkey in built, it must be able to process JS events.

BTW, there is a based program that wraps Mechanize called twill and it's
easier to use.
Twill: http://twill.idyll.org/

You can Selenium or Windmill to record form based logins using their GUI
recorders and save it as a python script that can be replayed. Windmill is

It can handle the HTML parts.

You can move to Windmill or some other tool that executes JavaScript code

For qmail to accept mails for your domain, the entry for the domain should
be present in rcpthosts and virtualdomains (since you have installed
vpopmail).
For the mails to be delivered, qmail will look at the
/var/qmail/users/assign file to decide the next set of actions

You can send me the output of qmail-showctl offline if you need help

The monitor turns off automatically after 'x' minutes though I disabled the
screensaver. Can somebody let me know how could I disable it? I would want
to leave the monitor on as I'm using it as a monitoring tool for my team.

It is under the control of Power Management. Check the PM setting.

Disabling screen saver does just that -- disables the screen saver from showing 
up. To avoid the monitor from blanking you have to tweak the power management 
functions of your system.

Depending on the desktop environment you use, you can change it using the 
appropriate tool. For GNOME it is called 'gnome-power-preferences'

A quick google tells me controlling this is possible also possible using xset 
(the dpms option):

You probably already know this.The conflict resolution procedure in
mercurial:

1. hg pull
2. hg update ( steps 1 & 2 can be combined with hg pull -u )
3. hg merge (if step 2 fails)
4. Find out files with conflicts with 'hg status'
5. Sort out conflict either with GUI merge tool or by physically removing
    conflict markers etc (depending on your merge tool configuration)
6. hg resolve -m "***"
7. hg ci -m "***"
8. hg push (etc)

Is this a repo that's publicly available for cloning ?

Try updating to the latest version of mercurial if all else fails. The older

repo formats are compatible.

I too faced similar issues when I try to scrap a web page with lot of
javascript. After trying lot of things I finally ended up with PyQt4
WebView, though its like running a full blown browser but it does the
job.

Now, lets talk about sites that aren't that very cross browser
compatible. Say for example sites that were developed exclusively for
MSIE.

In RHEL, we do not explicitly have a Menu for Power Management. Hence I had
to disable via Steve's method...thanks Steve..great work. In case I have
issues, I'll post back.

our work flow is like this:

there are two developers, each with their own repo - they commit to a 
bitbucket repo. When the code is approved it is pulled to the production site. 
So there are totally 4 repos. A commits code and pushes it. B changes the same 
line that A has changed and commits. Then B pulls A's code. Whatever B tries, 
he is unable to merge. 

alternative scenario - B finds bitbucket site is down and has to push directly 
to production. Later A changes the same line of code and that is pulled to 
production. merge/commit/update fails on the production site.

on several occasions I had to solve the problem by rm -rf ing the repo and

If you could mention the exact hg commands that A, and B are using, it
will be helpful to reproduce the scenario.

how that would play out in a merge scenario with multiple repos.

probably hell - I am on mercurial after 5 years of svn, and still have a 
tendency to do things the svn way. Anyway I played with 4 repos and now have 
figured it out:

1. hg pull
2. hg merge
if conflict:
3. edit file
4. hg merge -m filename
5. hg commit 

and done. This works with 4 toy repos with 2 files - let us see if works on a 
production server with many files and pressure.

To make it simple,You can find the actual posted url using LiveHttp
headers(I think /login/main.asp in your case ).

Then use urllib,urllib2 with POST parameters,

values = {'LoginName' : 'AAA',
          'PIN' : 'BBB,
          'Password' : 'CCC' }

data = urllib.urlencode(values)
req = urllib2.Request(url, data)
response = urllib2.urlopen(req)
the_page = response.read()

The reponse page contains," Login Error" with description
"""
  Error: Session cannot be established. Enable per-session cookies
   in your browser's security settings and login again.
"""

Which means handling cookies should make it work.

You might want to check the log /var/log/qmail/qmail-smtpd/current

Likely that gmail decided the responses were spam! Check your spam mail,
Kiran. And if you find mails from this list there, mark it 'not spam'.

On a related note, I was wondering if someone wanted to revive the
LOST project (which I use for generating my signatures; hope people
don't mind). The last update seems to have been several years ago; I
plan to get in toch with the original maintainers of the project about
it.

You should check the bash man page. It's used to set some attributes
to variables. For example,

x=Kumar
typeset -r x
x=Kumar2 # ? Causes an error, since "-r" marks x read only.

The bash man page provides a short explanation. This should help as
well:

OK, please tell me how much of a deviation "one stanza tips" are from
"tip of the day". If you think they are virtually unrelated, then I'll
apologize and not repeat this.

Girish must have got busy with something else.  It takes time and 
patience to put such things on a regular basis.

As an alternate source for information pick up "Linux in a Nutshell" 
pub. O'Reilly. Whenever I open the book I learn something new.

I have not used it but have seen animation features created with it; the

I never contradicted your claim. Anyway, hope someone can step in with
the tips. Else I'll try to do it sometime.

Guys

I am trying to fix my monitor as a admin monitoring tool for my work. *The
idea is to have 2-3 applications windows to display in fullscreen mode in a
loop at regular interval.* Can you guys think of anything? For a better idea
consider it something like the bank token counter display TV or a railways
schedule display billboard which gets updated dynamically. I could give you
more detailed information as this thread hits your questions.

i am presuming you want the system to be in non interactive mode when you
get into this mode ??

To answer your second part of question it would be

if you think space is a contrain then do multihead.

Yes..that's true.

<http://haskell.org/sitewiki/images/a/aa/Screen-triplehead-galois.jpg>

This is close but I wouldn't wanna tile the windows in such a way rather I'd
want them to display individually [since I got a 15"monitor :(], say each
for 10 seconds, before it is succeeded by the other. So for instance I have
App1, App2 & Firefox. I would want to see Firefox for 10 seconds, App1 for
10 seconds, App2 for 10 seconds into an infinite loop. I need the monitor
only for Display purpose & nothing more.

I am not aware of any shrink wrapped tool that would switch display in
fullscreen mode.

conky is what my friend uses. And you have gkrellm applications and a whole
bunch of Xwindow stuff and wmaker applets but they are all really tiny.

You are better off doing it yourself and publishing it in sourceforge with nice
screenshots.

I am damn sure your project will get a lot of attention if done properly.

Kumar Appiah,

I really feel that tips I send cannot be compared with anything else.

Certainly not LOST.

Anyway the reason I am unable to do it now is that I am emotionally disturbed
on account of my business situation.

It is certainly not the paucity of time or the energy and effort that
goes into sending
tips.

In all sincerity I can claim that LUG as a whole has done very little
to me for all the
effort I put in for your welfare.

It continues to be a noxious place with bad individuals always keen to
find faults with other people.

It is almost as though there were a reward in finding shortcomings.

I say who gave you the right to find fault with anybody?

Do I do that?

I only criticize you in general when things go out of control.

So it is a sad truth that most individuals who talk a lot in LUG are
here to show off and to find fault with others.

I am finding it increasingly difficult to pull on and contribute in
such an unhealthy surroundings.

Even some of my close friends who I built a relationship over half a
decade do not understand my true nature. Sigh!

Anyway now coming back to tips, I shall resume it in a fortnight or so.

Depending upon my business situation.

I am in big trouble and no mistake.

Sending tips is no effort at all for me but I deliberately opted out
of it due to other reasons.

Hopefully this shall resume soon.

Let us pray for the best!

May God bless you All!

Ever yours,
Girish

My company (www.artha42.com) will be interested in hiring. Do count me
in on this one. If you need me to talk to other firms, I would be more
than happy to oblige. There are other groups like
HeadStart(http://headstart.in/) who might be interested in this too.

LUG is a co-operative place. The reward for the efforts are similar
efforts from other members. I guess there are many ILUG-C members who
have been contributing to the lively atmosphere in the list.

The proportion of fault finding, criticising emails in ILUG-C is quite
low. You just learn to ignore them and live with the abundance of
positive emails.

I have tried this modem on ubuntu 9.10, and it works out of the box. Was
absolutely simple to get it connected infact. I know ubuntu has added
support for most of the   data cards in India recently.

to configure it on fedora, you may want to have a look at these articles

I'm not aware of any such list. However, the Huawei EG162G which is
provided by Idea Cellular functions without any setup in Ubuntu 9.04. In
Ubuntu 9.10 only the storage mode is possible with this modem AFAIK.

Looks like one more organization on transition mode aka cost cutting , my
friend there are two way to get this done

1) Google
2) Pay someone to do the Research for you since no two organizational
requirements are similar

freshmeat.net  should be a good starting point now start digging or pay
someone to do the digging for you ;-)

Almost all the project management tools that I know are crap. I don't
think there is even one good product. But
redmine(http://www.redmine.org/) cuts it real close. I myself use
Pivotal Tracker (http://www.pivotaltracker.com) for tracking the user
stories and bugs. Since most of the content we produce is visual (web
apps) we mock up heavily before building. I like the interface first
approach to building software. So we use Balsamiq
Mockups(http://www.balsamiq.com/) for that. It is not open source but
it is totally worth it. Not all proprietary software is evil. :-)

> 2)Document Review

Wiki on Redmine is good enough.

> 3)Code Review

This should be integrated with your source code system. For me, I work
from both home and office and I need a server to be present online to
do the code review. I am a huge fan of git(http://git-scm.com/) so I
evaluated gitorious(http://gitorious.org/). It is a memory hog and
needs constant maintenance. So, I switched to using github for our
internal projects too. I does involve a small cost but it is totally
worth it. Besides you still own all the information on the git repo.
It is a wonderful service to visualize and organize the information in
your git repo. It is amazing for code reviews. BTW, you must read on
their architecture
(http://github.com/blog/530-how-we-made-github-fast). It is quite
impressive. The amount of open source projects that have come out of
github alone is mind boggling.

We work on our individual branches for tasks and merge them continuously.

> 4)Software Version control

If you are not using git, you are missing out on a lot. Mercurial is
also good. But I personally like the way git handles branches. It is
very transparent. I am not sure if mercurial supports cherry picking
commits. But git does. So it makes it really simple especially when
you are working on separate branches.

> 5)Development - c

I am not sure about it here. Emacs or Vim is pretty good i guess.

> 6)Bug Tracking

Again, I havent found anything that is prefect here. I did the mistake
of choosing pivotal for a project. I regret it till now. Redmine is
decent for bugs. Also there are tools like bugzilla.

> 7)Test Managent

I am a ruby guy so I like shoulda a lot. Test/Unit, Shoulda,
ObjectDaddy and Rake are my weapons of choice. I am not sure of the
equivalents in C.

> 8) Test Automation

I think you meant continuous integration here. I guess hudson is good
here. I personally use a very lightweight tool called integrity
(http://integrityapp.com/). This works only with git. But it is
perfectly fine for us. The app itself is very lean and the source very
readable.

> 9)Document Manager

We use wikis and source control to store documents. It is not the best
way but its okay. I have been urging my team to use only text for
documentation. I myself use rst and rst2pdf for documentation. But
others prefer a more visual tool like open office. There is an
inherent mismatch in the way documents and source code are to be
versioned. Documents are versioned individually while source code
should be versioned as a tree. Also documents tend to be linearly
versioned. In a sense that the probability of a merge conflict in a
document is almost close to zero. However, this happens almost all the
time with code. So the solution would be to have a separate repo for
documents and still have them versioned. This is what we do for
documents but I know this is not perfect. If others have a better
approach do let us know.

> Please include any other category...

And we of course use Google Apps for our domain. My 2 paise.

Vagmi

You can write to CDEEP and ask them for the DVD. I am trying to
circulate a local copy.

Would it be possible for you to share off-list perhaps, a contact to
whom I should write ? An email address, preferably, would be most
helpful.

Message-ID: <9d3184460912211759k4e44f732tedacc213b6292e13@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
How to use -p option of the print command in korn shell
*This is an extraction from man print*
-p If you have started a co-process running with the *|&* command (see ``More
about redirecting input and
output''<http://osr507doc.sco.com/en/OSUserG/_redirect_input_and_output.html>),
the *-p* flag makes *print* send its output to the co-process via a pipe.
if you could give me an example for print -p, it would be much better [1].

Thanks

[1] I go-ogled enough before posting in the list.

I suggest you try and get your hands on "Elephant's dream", the first
animation movie ever to be made entirely using "only" FOSS. Blender has been
used greatly in the movie. That should give you an idea about its
"greatness" . ;-)

you can set the proxy env variables and yum will pick the values from
there. Check the below link.
http://docs.fedoraproject.org/yum/sn-yum-proxy-server.html

Probably you can write a wrapper script for yum and provide it to the
user. Let this script ask for the credentials and set the env before
invoking yum. 

Hope this helps.

Siva.

Adding to that the first result on youtube search gave

Of course there are  better tutorials on the web !

Start from php.net site for basic tutorials .

Hi Ravi,
If you start any process in ksh using |& instead of the usual &, the
korn shell will create a special two way pipeline between the two
shells. The shell you are working on presently is the parent shell and
the background shell is the child shell. The read -p in the parent
shell reads a line of the standard output of the child shell.
Similarly print -p in the parent shell prints a line on the standard
input of the child shell. In short, input to the child shell can be
given using print -p and the output of it can be read using read -p.
So it may be clear from now that the child shell can be any predefined
program with a standard input and output. Now consider the following
example, I start sqlplus using |& and communicate with it using the
parent shell.

$sqlplus -s ${USR_PWD} |&
$print -p "SELECT count(*) FROM dba_objects WHERE status != 'VALID';"
$read  -p OUT

The  result prints the number of dba objects with status as INVALID.

Similarly, this functionality can be used in several places. Hope I
have cleared your doubt.

Harish R

Message-ID: <20091223041340.5839B1DB257@www.ae.iitm.ac.in>

Dear All,

Myself have conducted half day workshop on "IT Infrastructure Management using Linux/FOSS" in AVIT (Vinayaka Mission's University) on Monday (21-12-09).  Totally 35 Non-Teaching staffs / Technical Assistants from all departments have attended the workshop.

I have demonstrated the use of Ubuntu 9.10 using Live DVD and introduced various tools/softwares
for day-to-day use.

openoffice
firefox
empathy
software development tools
user management tools etc.

and also installed the same on to HDD later on.  The response from the participants was really good and I would like to specially thank Mr. Shiv Shankar (HOD-CSE) and principal Dr. Mrs. N.R.Alamelu for the intiative and opportunity.

Tuesday (22-12-09)

I also did a one day workshop on Fedora-12 at Periyar Centenary Polytechnic College (Autonomous), Vallam, Thanjavur for the Third year IT students. (I am also a Program Advisory Comittee (PAC) member for Computer Engineering / IT Department)  I have done a kickstart based installation on a Desktop PC through network (totally 3190 packages installed) and demonstrated various foss tools which can be used for lab experiments.

Later on, around 2.30 we had the committe meeting, and it was decided that from 3rd semester to 6th semester, all practicals and Lab experiments for Computer Engineering and IT Department need to be taught using Linux/FOSS tools from the next academic year.  The support from Principal, HODs, staff members, Technical Admins really impressed me and hope PCPC would be successfully implementing Linux/FOSS from the next academic year.

Since TCP/IP does not guarantee time of delivery, how can an NTP client be
sure of the accuracy of the time served from an NTP server?

If you are not concerned about atomic precision and only want all system in the lan to have same time, easiest is to configure time server and use rdate.
Designate one system as server, enable time server under xinetd.d or inetd.
use rdate command from clients to query server time and adjust itself. rdate can be run at boot time or as cronjob.

ntpd is one of the commonly used. Run one of the server as ntpd server. And reset of the servers are ntpd client and point the ntpd server. It will sync automatically.

It is best to run your local NTP server which derives it's clock 
reference from a well known external NTP server [1]. To the best of my 
knowledge the NTP servers from [1] are good enough for us mortals.

Although /etc/services lists ntp for both udp and ntp, to the best of my 
knowledge it runs on udp.  On the issue of accuracy, it is better than 
relying on the local CMOS clock as a reference!  I am satisfied if my 
laptop/desktop clock is accurate to within a second of it's external NTP 
reference.

What is the package name for rdate.  Could not find it in openSUSE; 
there is ntpdate though.

A few words of caution; while rdate/ntpdate (via cron/bootup scripts) 
may be good for desktops, I have found it best to use ntpd (in client 
mode) on servers.  In one email server, I was running ntpdate (via cron) 
and dovecot was very particular about time drifts and would shut itself 
down.  From that incident, I use ntpd (in client mode) to sync time.

An aspect of font development that would be most welcome is the
addition of font test cases. I would exhort that this area be also
looked into when developing and releasing fonts. Building up a
comprehensive test case suite for fonts is required at this stage.

no - but there is a stupid captcha which you have to fill in if you do not have 
a login. It only takes a few seconds to get one, so if you are planning to 
contribute something, it is a good idea to have a log in.

http://ilugc.in/ is up.  Can't see any CSS problems here.
http://ilugc.org.in/ seems to be showing some map of India with Kashmir cut off.
http://ilugc.org/ isn't the lug site.

I'm eyeing the Acer Aspire Revo as my next XBMC box.

The Revo is a small Intel Atom based nettop, which sports Nvidia Ion
graphics.  Can playback H.264 encoded 1080p HD content effortlessly.
Revo has HDMI, esata and USB out and retails for $200 on newegg.com.
Full hardware support is available in latest XBMC builds.

See:
http://lifehacker.com/5391308/build-a-silent-standalone-xbmc-media-center-on-the-cheap

There are plenty of  good lifehacker articles on XBMC + Revo.


If you can find the Revo in Chennai, please let me know!

Hai Lifna,

Welcome to the group.

We usually send our holiday greetings to "Kenneth Gonsalves"
<lawgon@thenilgiris.com> so that he can send us a consolidated list at
the end of the festival time.  Please do so from now on, instead of
mailing the group.

Please read the mailing list guidelines, and hang around for a while
to see how things are done around here.

Enjoy your stay.

Regards,
Roshan Mathews

I don't personally  trust zebronics for quality, but if one is looking for a
really inexpensive solution, this may work.

The chotu cabinet has overheating problems and I don't recommend it.
I went with a regular mini cabinet to fit a dual core Atom and 2 x HDDs
for my NAS box at home.  Revo form factor would have been excellent.

it is considered one of the most serious breaches of internet etiquette to 
expose a person's email address or phone number in a publicly accessible place 
without his consent. In many forums the offender is instantly ejected. Before 
advising newcomers on etiquette I suggest you bone up on it ...

@listadmin - if possible please obfuscate the email address in the archives.

And yet, http://www.google.co.in/#q=lawgon%40thenilgiris.com shows
that it hasn't really been something you have normally obfuscated.

I just figured, given the mail this morning where you took upon
yourself to educate the list on netiquette, you might want to hear
from our latest member.

Season's greetings! :)

*I* am entitled to put my email address anywhere in the world or even paint it 
on the roads - *you* are not. Without *my* permission you have absolutely no 
right over my personal data. And do not try to avoid the point. You have 
behaved irresponsibly - own up to it. Unless you are actually justifying the 
exposure of my personal data?

I'm only pointing out that your great moral outrage though voluble is
barely justifiable.  Surely you overreact?

Btw, not sure about that painting on the roads bit.  But then, unlike
you, IANAL.  :)

as already suggested - learn something about etiquette. I do not suppose you 
have noticed that email addresses are obfuscated in the archives of this list? 
or in most lists? (I wonder why we Indians are so reluctant to acknowledge 
that we have made a mistake?) Just admit it - get it off your chest and enjoy 
Christmas.

Au contraire, I checked the archives when you complained, Mailman had
already obfuscated it.  As already suggested, maybe you're
overreacting.  (I wonder why you lawyers jump to conclusions and make
mountains out of molehills.)  You have a merry Christmas too.

so you are still contending that what you did was according to etiquette? btw, 
did mailman obscure it or did the list admin do it? anyway to test I will put 
an email id here and see what happens. The id is 'idiot@hotmail.com' and do 
not worry - that id is registered to me, so no one will be harmed by the 
experiment.

As for your attempted defence, I have seen that the most common defence in 
rape cases is - 'she is a woman of loose character, so no big deal'. Sounds 
familiar no?

Message-ID: <200912241740.29286.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

I was looking at the list archives in both gmane and mailman. In gmane the 
obfuscation of email addresses is done properly. The domain name is concealed. 
In mailman, the obfuscation is not done according to the accepted standard. 
The full email address is revealed, but 'at' substituted for '@'. Even a child 
can write a script to decode this. And address harvesters have far more 
sophisticated scripts at their command. Listadmin may kindly follow the 
accepted practice of 'username@...'.

or s/he may have learnt that security is a process - holes appear, they are 
plugged. More holes appear and they too are plugged. And the list gets more 
and more secure. (see my post on another thread). Eternal vigilance is the 
price of freedom and security. Unless you are contending that exposing email 
addresses in publicly accessible archives is a good thing?

kindly refrain from abusive language

actually mailman did not - the address is not obfuscated. And thanks to your 
carelessness, a hole has been discovered in the archives. Can we take this as 
your Christmas present to the list?

sarcasm - apparently he got annoyed that I had sent a mail to the list asking 
people to refrain from flooding the list with season's greetings.

Hi,

No offense. But can we please keep this discussion offline? People involved
can come to a conclusion offline and then post the suggestion, if and only
if it is *necessary* to post it in a Linux users' mailing list!

Apologize to the other members, but could not resist pointing this out:

When I click on lawgon.livejournal.com, I can see half your life history
(and your email id) listed there!! So, what's the big deal here?

That said, I agree that mailman should do a better job of scrubbing email
ids - at least for the sake of other members really would like to keep it
private!

iBall has a mini cabinet for Nettop boards and the LiL from Circle.  I 
have bought the Lil and the real estate inside is quite adequate for a 
nettop but the physical dimensions will not allow a regular PCI card.

The quality of the Circle Lil is the best among that from iBall Circle 
etc.

There is a big deal.
KG has already gave example.
his contact email id belongs to him. he has full right to share with
anybody at anyplace. we do not have this right (unless he release his
contact details under some CC license).

you find a man beaten and dying on the road - so you give him one more shot and 
finish him off - anyway he is dying, so what is the big deal there?

some one's privacy is invaded - pictures of him naked are plastered all over 
the internet - so you join in the party and paste a few more in flickr - anyway 
he is exposed so what is the big deal in exposing him some more?

unfortunately it is a sad part of our society in general and our justice 
system in particular that it is usually the victim of the crime who is on 
trial when an offence is prosecuted. I know a police station near Chromepet 
which refused to accept a burglary complaint saying: 'why did you keep your 
jewels in your house - you are at fault!'

and before some one chirps up and says that this is OT to this group, I would 
like to point out that freedom and the right to privacy are an integral part 
of the free software movement - and the respect to privacy is an integral part 
of the war against spammers which we in this list, and every one in all 
internet forums is fighting.

I am a little surprised that you agree that the obfuscation done on our list 
is insufficient. After all some spammer must have already written a script and 
harvested the addresses - so what is the big deal about this?

And I suppose you will say the same about Stallman's campaign against 
sacrificing privacy to cloud computing firms, or Behlendorf's campaign against 
sacrificing privacy to gmail. Everyone is doing it - so what is the big deal?

All of us are involved in keeping the list more and more secure - and also in 
giving confidence to people who join this list that whatever private 
information they give to the list will be protected. That their email 
addresses will not be harvested. That they will not receive unsolicited mail. 
etc etc etc.

Can we apply some filter (at mailman) before sending each mail. Filter
can be used to replace email id into empty string !(I have no idea
about mailman, but this is just a suggestion)!

there is an RFC on obfuscation of mail in archives - and it can be done in 
mailman. Mumbai lug does it - so do linuxchix, gmane, gmail ... no big deal

Friends.

I am getting requests for projects from MBA(HR) friends.
Thinking on how to make them to contribute to FOSS instead of going to
a company.

Share your thoughts on how to help them in a FOSS way.

Thanks.

Are you talking about student's project ??

This depends on their coding skill and interest. the main idea must be
* student will be able to develop some minimum software using foss tools ,
it can be a command line also. no need to have a rpm at the final stage
* student must be able to use svn/cvs and get familiar with development
process,(bug tracking etc)
* they must be able to put and think the license file, This step is
necessary as this will make a software "FOSS".
* they must lean about the documentation and why it is needed.

contribution can be done with translation also,

also writing and inspiring other to use FOSS and develop is also a imp way
to contribute,,

This is what Free Software Foundation - Tamilnadu[1] did,
FSF-TN conducted a two days workshop in the beginning of this month, they made all the students participated in that workshop involve in projects[2] initiated by them, those students were divided into groups, and each group divided according to the colleges they were from, and they assigned a particular project/task to each group. The main part is when the students were assembled to give first review about their project/review in IFMR[3], MBA students from IFMR were assigned to each group as project managers, to co-ordinate group members and maintain constant development.
I hope this will be helpful to you

I hope they are just end users. not developers.

How can we relate these contributions with their MBA HR final year projects?

They could chip in with their domain knowledge.
One project that I can think off top of my head would be openerp. It
lags behind when it comes to HR functions especially payroll.
Then there is orangeHRM.
Among other things, they could formulate policies on how FOSS can be
adopted in organisations.

The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.

Oysters open completely when the moon is full; and when the crab sees one
it throws a piece of stone or seaweed into it and the oyster cannot close
again so that it serves the crab for meat. Such is the fate of him who opens
his mouth too much and thereby puts himself at the mercy of the listener.

Hi geeks,
      Guide me how to setup a cloud (Cloud Computing). I tried Google but no
document available for free.
I want to use the services at two different physical systems, to be accessed

Subject: [Ilugc] Solution : How can we update the package lists & install
	packages in 
	newly installed [ubuntu os] system without Internet and Repository
	DVDs
Message-ID: <6a7659850912261112p248bacafqb0745c05a5f419ff@mail.gmail.com>

problem :
--------

My friends having system which is installed ubuntu 9.10 . But they
dont have Internet connection to update package lists and can't
install any applications.

But I am having Internet connection and I installed many essential
packages in my system.

How can we transfer the archives (i.e. deb files ) and as well as
packages lists ( i.e. Index list in Synaptic Package Manager ) to
newly installed system , os as ubuntu ?

Solution :
----------

Myself and my brother Pasupathy were tried to solve this problem and
finally we achieved too.

Just do the following simple steps .

1) Install ubuntu in one system say? " system A " and update the
system via Internet . Now the index list of synaptic package manager
having 28,878 files [ in ubuntu 9.10 ].

2) Install the essential applications and softwares. for eg :
ubuntu-restricted-extras , vlc , mplayer ,
compizconfig-settings-manager , etc.,


Take Backup : part 1
------------? -------


3) copy the package lists and its information to show in synaptic ,
from the updated system by the following command

$ sudo cp -r /var/lib/apt/lists? /home/[user name]/backup/



4) copy the package lists in binary format

$ sudo cp /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin? /home/[user name]/backup/

$ sudo cp /var/cache/apt/srcpkgcache.bin? /home/[user name]/backup/


5)? Now we are going to backup the archives directory. It contains
.deb files.? While installing any application from net , the
downloading files are storing in this directory only (as .deb)

$ sudo cp -r /var/cache/apt/archives? /home/[user name]/backup/



Copy this backup folder into Pen drive.




Thats all ! we backuped all our resource from the system which is
updated via Internet also installed many applications.

part 2: Make update
------

Update & Install the applications in freshly installed [ubuntu] system
( sys " system B " ) without Internet and Repository Dvds.


Open synaptic package manager and note the no of index package lists .
( approximately 1300)


Plug the pen drive into this system and copy the "backup" direcory
into that home directory.

Now


$ cd backup

$ ls

archives? lists? pkgcache.bin?? srcpkgcache.bin


$ sudo cp -r lists?? /var/lib/apt/

$ sudo cp pkgcache.bin? /var/cache/apt/

$ sudo cp srcpkgcache.bin? /var/cache/apt/

$ sudo cp -r archives?? /var/cache/apt/



----------

Thats all.



Now go and open the synaptic package manager .?? Wow ! Oops !?? Now
the no of packages lists in that is 28,878 .

Now u can install , whatever u backuped installed applications from
the " system A " , "system B " also can install those packages without
download from the internet or repository Dvds .


Now try to install ubuntu-restricted-extras , vlc , mplayer ,
compizconfig-settings-manager .? With 1 min , it should be installed.

The only? , we can not install the application beyond the backuped
source from "system A" without Internet .thing


I hope , this may helps to ubuntu admin .

Now in kanchilug , we are installing the packages in various systems
by this way only .?? It works well !

There is this software called apt-on-cd which can do all these things
automatically and should save a lot of manual work.

Thanks a lot for the info.  I find that 'apt-on-cd' program is part of 
the ubuntu software package and that this can be installed thru Synaptic 
Package Manager.

This is very useful as a backup also.

Having worked in a management institute for almost 3 years, some
thoughts that cross the mind in this regards are,

Introduce them to project like OrangeHRM (community version), some
resume manager, limesurvey

and ask them to build a HRMS based on that.

Most likely HR students are not that tech savvy to code ... of course
the usual caveats apply

I know couple of my friends who write's code day in day out (they work as a
Senior Software Engineers in the reputed multinationals ) to win their bread
and better. They were joined in MBA Course  in the A*** University, when it
comes to final year project, their guide suggested them to look into the
managerial way rather than technical aspects into the problem ( in sense,
it doesn't matter whether you code or not ).

They done with their Project, submitted their thesis passed out with the
Honours.

I had a chance to glance  their thesis it contains 100% stories [Complied
from Internet, CUT,  COPY and PASTE ] and 0% codding. Then I though MBA
project is all about CCP [1].

Its my personal experience with the Project 'MBA' .  I came to know these
because they are room-mates, sometime I used to google for them.  lol

But would've taken the fun, challenge and the 'eureka moment' out of doing
it yourself :-). Worth a lot of manual work.

there is a program - "startup application" This may help you. (modify
this package, and add firefox as one startup application),

Thanks Narendra Sisodiya, The problem is i should implement this without any
extra package since i am concerned about its minimal size, and use FLTK *
graphical* user interface.
What is the script/configuration file that is responsible for starting up
gui applications?

You need to do:

$ sudo gedit file.php
in order to save files to protected directories.

MBA( HR) lemme think they can think of research in

FOSS and Democracy/Govt : Fuctioning of Govt.
FOSS and Politics : Humans are political in nature does FOSS help in
overcoming that instinct too.
FOSS and Employability specific in .in context : How community can play  +ve
role in Economy through employment and what it takes to get a Day job in
Alien world in the Context of Foss professionals.
FOSS and Cosumer Bahaviour across .in : What do i need FOSS for aka common
man does he perceive the same way as we are thinking.

all of these i suppose involve Human factor in some way , does it Qualify i
donna , just my 2 cents.

Normal users don't have permissions to write there of the /var/www/
directory.
Either work as a super user, by using the command in command-line
sudo su

or change file permissions of  /var/www/ for testing at home :)

Guys

Any idea why my thunderbird doesn't download all the mail even when I set up
the time-interval for synchronisation for a minute? It starts to download
the headers only when I click on that particular folder. Is this due to a
bug or something or should I be setting it up properly?

I am NOT a developer. Primarily an admin

Alternatively someone who is experienced in web development would like
to post a tutorial explaining the workflow of a web based project
using tools like IDE, SCM, profilers, the concept of
Development-test-production environment etc in a simple way which
would enormously benefit the students / newcomers to development.

I use crude methods sometimes to hack away for minot changes in php
scripts et. al. and the change perms etc as required which I know is
not a proper workcycle. How I wish somebody shares that domain
knowledge with us.

In return I will try and help out people with HA clustering, and the
such when it comes to admin (Centos, RHEL esp.)

Most of the tutorials I have seen is mostly about using specific tool
and very basic. they do not cover too much (I have seen some thing
like that in exlipse a little bit)

I will also help in reviewing, testing out the methods to my abilities.

Read this: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/public_html.html

Then you can access your webpages from http://localhost/~username
provided you're hosting on your own computer. This is really very
convenient for a number of reasons.

Please avoid sending the same mail to the list again and again as it
is equivalent to spamming. Iirc, you had already sent 2 mails for the
same already and this is your third. This isn't an accepted practice.

Subject: [Ilugc] Workshop at Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda,
	Vadodara, Gujarat
Message-ID: <d16b1c80912271104j4b1f380j879e868bb4a09efa@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I had conducted a one-day Fedora, Free Software workshop at the
Bachelor of Computer Applications department, Maharaja Sayajirao
University of Baroda (Vadodara), Gujarat, India on Saturday, December
26, 2009.

Thanks to VGLUG [1] for coordinating with me for the past few months
in organizing this event. I would like to thank the Fedora project for
sponsoring the travel.

* The BCA department lab systems were equipped to run on Fedora 12,
and we used it for couple of the hands-on sessions:
- Use of git: di-git-ally managing love letters [2]
- Packaging Fedora RPM [3]

* I had also addressed the following topics:
- i-want-2-do-project. tell-me-wat-2-do-fedora [4]
- Badam Halwa of Embedded Systems [5]

* Participants were from the BCA department, and had also come from
Ahmedabad [6]. Vadodara (Baroda) connects to Ahmedabad via a 95km
expressway [7].

* Free/Open Source Software is officially included in the Gujarat
state school syllabus for higher secondary (XI and XII). In the coming
years it is expected to be even introduced from standard VIII.

* The Department coordinator and Professor V A Kalamkar is happy to
facilitate work between VGLUG, and the students for Free/Open Source
Software projects. We hope to have more interaction with them in the
future.

* VGLUG members are also keen on participating in the Fedora project
at various sub-projects of their interests.

* Due to the political crisis [8] in Hyderabad, I was uncertain about
reaching the Hyderabad airport, and thus making it to the workshop.
The bandh was withdrawn for December 25th, and when I made it the
airport on the 25th, the scheduled flight was cancelled. So, I had to
re-schedule a different flight, but, the airline officials said they
couldn't guarantee if I will make it to my connecting flight in
Mumbai. This re-scheduled flight got delayed even further. Luckily, my
connecting flight also got delayed, and I finally managed to make it
to Vadodara.

* As customary, here are some photos taken during the trip:

That was helpful though I found the right answer. You need to set *
mail.check_all_imap_folders_for_new* to *true. *And that did the trick.
Thanks for your time.

I feel it would be nice to come up with a list of Laptop Model's and their
configuration for a GNU/Linux OS. Many people face trouble coming up with
the right drivers for their hardware, and waste a lot of time searching on
configuring them. Eg. My friend's  took ages finding a Via chrome AGP driver
for Karmic(HCL). A centralized wiki may save a lot of time.

Just a suggestion :) Cheers!

I decided to write a guide providing buying advice for people who want
laptops: <http://pastebin.com/m7d07d63>. Seriously, those guys make the
crappiest stuff possible.

Seriously, though, Ubuntu has such a list (though it could use quite a
bit of formatting)

+1.

This will add value to FOSS. A paper on FOSS and Government, for
example, can be used by government departments to formulate their IT
policies.

Also, they could do a detailed comparative analysis of development models of
both FOSS / Corporate world, with respect to "Human factors" like
motivation, attrition, leadership,ownership etc.

1. php scripts are executed by web server (apache httpd) of the web
application.

2. The files should be accessible from webroot
(/var/www/ in your installation, /usr/local/apache/htdocs is another
location which is commonly  used)

3. With files stored in a directory under webroot, and webserver
started, you can access the files through a browser:
http://127.0.0.1/yourscript.php
OR
http://127.0.0.1/mydocuments/myscript.php

4. Usually webroot is owned by root. You can organize your working
scripts following way:
mkdir /home/yourloginname/myapplication
sudo ln -s /home/yourloginname/myapplication /var/www/myapplication

5. Now you can create, edit and save files in
/home/yourloginname/myapplication directory and run the files by
http://127.0.0.1/myapplication/myscript.php

==OR you change ownership of webroot (/var/www in your case)
chown yourlogin /var/www (which is not recommended)===

Hope this helps.

Hi Saravanan,

It depends on what you want to do with a cloud. There are so many
technologies being passed around as cloud computing that its a joke.
However, in the true sense as I understand it, cloud computing is to
structure your problem and solution in such a manner that the problem
can essentially be split into any number of parallel operations and
then be collected on one machine. Google's MapReduce
(http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html) is one the most popular
papers in this area. Map Reduce is actually a method of solving a
problem and not all problems are amenable to this approach.

Hadoop (http://hadoop.apache.org/) is one such implementation that
might interest you. People have used hadoop in very interesting[1]
ways[2].

There is a very nice tutorial on setting up Hadoop on a multinode
cluster. Hadoop does not rely on anything else apart from a ssh
connection made with a named user between these machines. If you can
get hold of a couple of powerful machines, I would suggest that you
start off 3 or 4 instances of Ubuntu VMs and set up Hadoop on the
same. I had setup hadoop as an experiment a long time back using this
article. I am not sure if it is still relevant.

HTH.

Depends on what you want to check - whether  the log file exists, or
whether certain messages have occured etc. But I guess the most common
answer would be the tail command.

Hi all,
       I have to take prints of the Linux file system( hierarchy structure)
to analyze the files for remastering.
I use ls -R for the same purpose, process tree output structure would be
better.
Any command available?

In my case it would be

tail - if I want to see last few lines of the logs or see updates to
the logs in real time
head - to see first few lines of the logs
less - if I want to go through the logs in more details
grep - if I am searching for a specific pattern
tail + grep - to only see certain messages in real time

There is an application called ksystemlog, u can find it in the synaptic
package manager, where you can find the log informations. Most of the log
files are saved in /var/log

Personally i have used bind. It is one of the best/stable dns

Ubuntu Server 9.10 comes with option to setup a private cloud cluster based
on Eucalyptus. This is the ideal solution for you to get started and learn
about it imho.
Moreover, this is compatible with Amazon ec2.

http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/private
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEC


There is another, very interesting tool called openqrm, which I believe is
more advanced in terms of setting up.
http://www.openqrm.com/

Are you really RHCE qualified ? RHEL4 and 5 come with everything you

Tell us the steps followed to mount the CDROM and the error messages 
shown by the system. 

I hope, by default, only the root user can access the CDROM. So switch
to root user and mount, if that works, then give the device access
permission to the user thru the system->admin->user management menu.

Message-ID: <f3c782750912282120gecb7238q741ffee1f179f1f6@mail.gmail.com>

List,

I have been trying to search on reading an image file via C. I haven't
been able to find code without libraries. However, being aware of the
'binary' mode in Windows (Turbo C++), I had read it using fopen, fread
and fseek to read the header and then the contents. However, this
reading was done reading individual bytes and not reading it using
structures.

Apologies, ahead, because, I suspect I may be using wrong 'terms' or
may have some incorrect information. (Correct me, thanks)

For example, a .bmp (grayscale image) file has first 54 bytes as
header (IIRC, correct me, if I'm wrong). Somewhere within that,
there's the height and width of the image.

Following the 54 bytes are the pieces of image data containing
integers between 0 - 255 representing grayscale colors.

This seemed to work in Windows because I could see the results. Now, I
do know that there are libraries that make this task easier in various
distributions of Linux but the purpose (or requirements, If I may say)
here it to read it in the same way as it was done in Windows.

Though I also do see 'b' mode in the manual page of 'man fread', but
I'm doubtful about the results. If anyone has tried to read an image
file or has good sample code that I can lookup, would like to have
links to it. Alternately, if someone can put in a few details
regarding this in a little more 'easy-to-understand' way, that would
be helpful.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Gammu is also a very good one.It supports many models while Gnokii seems to
support only Nokia mobiles.

I used gammu to send and receive sms. Gammu daemon automatically put the new
sms into DB.

any specific reasons? Could there be a difference in the size of the
data types? Can you mask for the bits and see if that makes sense?

There is no binary mode in Unix, or rather the default is binary mode.
 It would be easier to know what you're talking about if you post your
code.

or perhaps it is the open/read functions that you need as opposed to
fopen and fread. again, just thinking aloud.

Are you sure your cdrom works ? to boot your system with live CD you
need to change your boot sequence in bios.

Did you try booting another OS live CD? There could also be a problem with
the CD -> could be corrupt.

he is a lead developer of CentOS (have you heard of it?) and a long time 
member of this list. So I have a feeling that he may be qualified to ask that 
question. And he has raised a valid point - surely an RHCE should not need to 
ask this question. Also please refrain from top posting. If you want to know 
what is top posting, check this out:

So as per your 'feeling'

1.) If a member is working in centos, he can pass judgments on OP's
certification as per 'this groups' rules	
2.) If he is a long time member of ILUGC he can get away with it

Frankly, this reeks of bias, I am a member of this group for a long time as
well, so does that give me the right to judge what other plp, off course I
don't work in centos just use it sometime.

C'mon. I doubt Kenneth meant that. Can we try to get things in the

he is not 'working' in centOS. He is a lead developer - so he can certainly 
pass judgement on an RHCE certification.

that was not what I meant - I meant that since he is a long time member, 
everyone knows his qualifications

I am surprised that being a long time member of this group you are still top 
posting. And of course it is biased. Open source/FOSS is not a democracy - one 
gives more weight to opinions of persons depending on their experience and 
skills.

Another option is to use mailscanner if you've a need to scan outgoing
mails. Look up http://www.mailscanner.info.

So you mean to say everyone on this list know's qualifications of all long
term members and active posters, this statement can get pretty downhill from
here, I hope you know this.

As a ILUGC mailing list member, I complain about a poster to you as a
moderator, and you come back and say 'hey! your no good as well' implying
that 'long term' members and plp who are active can get away with stuff
while a member who lurks and posts rarely should just get on.

Is this open source/FOSS software we are discussing about, this is about a
OP asking for specific technical  help/info on a subject matter (cloud
computing), and another 'long time member' OP doubting his certification
skills prima facie.

Your not offended because it was not directed to you, its is like saying 
'I was at the accident spot as a spectator and I did't think it was very
painfull, in fact it helped the OP because the the bad tooth dropped off
which was hurting him for sometime'

Message-ID: <98f424a30912282335s77658993x490f96899d232474@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I was writing a few lines of script to change the  *pwd* of my BASH to my
*project workspace* whenever i call it (because its a long path)

#!/bin/bash
DIRECTORY="/home/varrun/Desktop/TODO/Final_yr_project"
if [ -d "$DIRECTORY" ]; then
        echo "exists"
        cd  $DIRECTORY
else
        echo "project directory either wrong or doesnt exist"
fi

When i run it, the directory of my terminal does *not* change i guess
because a child process cannot pass arguments to a parent process.
Is there any other way i can do this?

Also, why does it show an error when i change
DIRECTORY="~/Desktop/TODO/Final_yr_project"

KBS really qualified to ask that Q. KBS is a lead DEVELOPER of CentOS
(Free RHEL). You need to note one point, he is not just stopped after
asking that Q. He gave a lead to the OP about HA VM-Farm.

STOP fighting and continue this discussion only if it is related to the
subject.


The whole point is, he is not qualified to ask that question just because he
works in centos, did he design the certification.
Shall I ask you the same question, how are you qualified to approve his
questioning of the OP. Kindly don't come back with iam
A 'long term member' and everyone knows my qualification.

He should have just answered the question, he should'nt have asked 'are you
really qualified'!

And what do you mean 'fighting', if I reply back on what's perceived as
biased response, you come back with 'Don't Fight'.

Instead of running it as
$ ./script
or
$ sh ./script
try
$ source ./script
or
$ . ./script

This might be a hack, so look around for better solutions.

Well, I think it should not change the directory of the calling
terminal, but within the script the directory will change. Try echoing
$PWD after the cd command.

It doesn't matter who is asking the question, if u know any solution help
them, or else watch other wise people giving solutions.
Not everyone is an expert everywhere, whoever he may be, it doesn't matter
if he cant give the solution for my question an comment like something else
on my certification,

If he is more talented let him show his qualification by answering all
queries, else he is worth nothing.

There are lots other sweet people who could help here, rather fighting in
jealousy.

This kind of behavior discourages people from asking their questions in
ILUGC list.

Worst thing is even the *deemed* wise person is supporting this. LOL

Its all about freedom, why don't you people object this kind of behavior.

I recently tried a portable SMS gateway solution called Katik:
    http://code.google.com/p/usablemobile/

Katik is python based and runs entirely out of a Symbian 60
cell phone.  You can implement a mini Twitter or Google SMS
Channels like service using Katik and a cell phone -- no computer
needed.

Talking about RHCE, How many of you know the syllabus of RHCE.Certification?
If your answer is "why should i" then please don't talk about it before
having basic knowledge about it.

Two kinds of people cant be won by knowledge,

* one with NO knowledge
* other with most knowledge but reluctant to learn something new.

You have to right click on the network manager icon, click on "Edit
Connections" and go to the "Mobile Broadband" tab, there you select your
device and click the "Edit" button. Here, you have to enter your user
credentials, only then will it work.

Message-ID: <92f9a9560912290104y4c3d27d0p6567cc6a41f51370@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Luggies,

I'm looking at upgrading from my old Reliance data card for mobile
internet access.  I've looked at Tata, Reliance and BSNL, but I'm
unable to separate marketing promises from actual real world
experience.


I would like some recommendations luggies who are actual users
of EVDO or other high speed mobile connectivity on their laptops.


For my requirement:
  1. 300kbps is more than sufficient,
  2. good coverage inside Chennai city, and to some extent in other metros
  3. fall back to slower GPRS/CDMA speeds if I'm out of coverage areas
  4. offer unlimited data plans for simplified billing
  5. Debian compatible hardware


Any advise is much appreciated!

The best example is your mail, which is not having any useful info (about
CC) for the OP. I request you to stop this kind of discussion.

Bye :)

Bharathi S

So your sending me a useless email to tell me stop writing useless emails
(as per you criteria that if there is no CC info its useless, you existing
email falls under that flag, apparently).

And just to refersh your memory on what the subject discussion is, the 'long
time member' and 'lead develeoper of centOS' made a unwarranted and a
baseless comment on a OP's certification which had nothing to do with CC.

Hi,
Make sure of the following.
1. your device is identified correctly (for me it is ZTE).
2. dial number #777
3. Correct user name (for me it is std code followed by EVDO phone numer)
4. Correct password
5. Check the 'Connect Automatically' checkbox. BSNL EVDO disconnects once in
a while for me!

Enjoy

I have been using Reliance for the last one year. I had a 144kbps and

Inside chennai, I have had connection problems in Tnagar, other than

I have used it in chennai, bangalore, madurai and some interiors of
Tamilnadu. Metros have a good speed, while small cities of tamil nadu
have you can have slower connection(you can browse if you have
patience).

As said above, Reliance have some slower fall back.

I would not say Reliance has the best of the plans available. I recently
heard that BSNL has a unlimited plan which costed less. But not sure of
their coverage.

>   5. Debian compatible hardware
I was able to configure Reliance with a my ubuntu desktop. However it
was not straight forward. Ubuntu treats my Reliance card as a memory
stick(actually it has some exe which gets auto executed in windows). So
had to do some teaks to get it working.

I am not sure about Chennai. Below are my experiences with EVDO and Photon +
in Coimbatore.

1. BSNL is highly unstable. you need to be as close as possible. coverage at
my house which is 3 kms away from evdo coverage is VERY BAD. I am not able
to get even 100 KBPS. While I am close to the EVDO tower, I am able to reach
till 700 or 750 KBPS. But tarriff is attractive (Rs. 750 unlimited). roaming
is not working for me with BSNL. :(

2. I may recommend photon for its stable connection. 1.x MBPS inside City,
600 to 800 KBPS at my house (away from city), 130 KBPS max where CDMA tower
is the only option (whereever tata indicom tower is available). Roaming is
good.

I dint test reliance. But friends say it is also good. but plans are
somewhat costlier than photon + (100 to 150 rupees difference).

Both photon + and BSNL evdo are well supported by Ubuntu 9.1 (I read in
forums like tata supplied 3 types of USB modems in which one is not
supported in Linux)

Hope it helps.

Well, you might not have permissions to store the file in /var/www. Type
"sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www" in the terminal and then try saving, else save
as super user (you have to type "sudo vim <php_file>" in terminal, edit and
then save the file in /var/www).

Apache parses the php files and  executes the code on the server when you

php5 package.

Why do you want to install it via a terminal? You can do:
System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager ->Edit->Mark Packages By
Task and check the "Lamp Server" checkbox, and it will automatically select
the necessary packages. But if you are really keen on installing it in the
terminal, type:
     $ sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-server-5.0

first there is no such thing as LAMP server. LAMP - which means Linux-apache-
mod_python-postgresql (it can also mean Linux-apache-mysql-perl) is a concept. 
It basically means that instead of having one monolithic server on the remote 
machine and special software on the client machine, one uses an existing 
webserver - which could be Apache, nginx, lighttpd, cherokee ..., a scripting 
language for your business logic - could be python, perl, ruby or even php, a 
database backend - could be postgresql, sqllite (or even couchdb) and a 
platform for all this - could be linux, some BSD or something else. And one 
accesses all this with an ordinary browser. Your ubuntu will already have 
python, perl and php. So you need to do:

sudo apt-get install apache2
sudo apt-get install postgresql

and you have LAMP. To light the LAMP is another thing - please look up some 
good resource in web programming.

Which version is it exactly? Ubuntu 9.02 is non-existent

If you are meaning 9.10, Yes, i do have a problem in connection too. It
often disconnects for me when i use EVDO.
It seems to be a Karmic bug, though it works great in Jaunty. In Karmic, I
use it using wvdial.

1. Install it using (if you can copy archives or from another active
internet connection)
$ sudo apt-get install wvdial

2. $ sudo wvdialconf

3. Edit /etc/wvdial.conf and make changes to your Phone # , Username and
passwd

4. $ wvdial

Isn't LAMP supposed to signify Linux-Apache-Mysql-PHP specifically? Did it
originally start as a concept or did it deliberately refer to
Linux-Apache-Mysql-PHP and later evolve as a concept?

Hi guys,


Has anybody implemented Educational services software which includes 
features like


1. Student information system (Online viewing of students activities 
both academic and extra-curricular,attendance,Marks grade etc).

2. Library management module.

3. School accounting module.


We found schooltool.org is similar to what we expected. But i would be 
interested if anybody used this software or any other.

please share your thoughts.


Thanks

there is moodle (http://moodle.org), a course management system,  which does
not do exactly what you are looking for, but its on the similar lines  and
is  worth having a look.

Hi all,
         How to find the difference between two directories, need a summary
of all the added, updated, deleted files/directories.
Like diff is for files, what is for directories?

That seems a little tricky. I am not aware of any commands for this
though. If i were to do this, i might do an

find dir -ls > file-timestamp.txt

to extract the dir details and the compare it with a later date
values. Does anyone know of a better way?

Hope u now have installed PHP, Apache and MySQL now.
Then u hav to write a PHP file and save it as filename.php in /var/www.
Open firefox browser, type http://localhost
All your files in /var/www will be listed.
You can click on the file to get the output or simply you can type
http://localhost/filename.php.
Errors will be displayed in the browser if any.

Everytime? These are new requirements :) You had only asked as to how
to cd to a directory from a script.

This should have been your actual question. It always helps to know
what you are trying to accomplish. Anyways, you could export the PC
command in your ~/.bashrc:

  export PC='cd /path/to/project/directory'

Source your ~/.bashrc once:

  $ source ~/.bashrc

and then use:

  $ $PC

If you copy your binaries or scripts into /sbin, you will break your
system in weired and wonderful ways.

Please read up on Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard to
learn the directory layout and consider putting your scripts in
/usr/local/bin/.

Hello friends,

>>1. BSNL is highly unstable. you need to be as close as possible. coverage at
my house which is 3 kms away from evdo coverage is VERY BAD. I am not able
to get even 100 KBPS. While I am close to the EVDO tower, I am able to reach
till 700 or 750 KBPS. But tarriff is attractive (Rs. 750 unlimited). roaming
is not working for me with BSNL. :(

To enhance the signal strength  i find the following link interesting

this should work. however there is a better option  than exporting command
line as a environment variable => specify an  alias in bashrc


http://linux.about.com/library/glossary/bldef_alias.htm
http://www.linux.org/lessons/beginner/l6/lesson6a.html

Varrun, this  is exactly what you should be doing. There is no need to
write a bash script to alias a command.

Don't know about .bmp image files, But simple dependency check for 
'ristretto'(Default image display app in XFCE) reveals that there are 
two well known libraries available for image processing,

$ ldd $(which ristretto) | less
         libjpeg.so.62 => /usr/lib/libjpeg.so.62 (0x00007f3ff6675000)
         libpng12.so.0 => /usr/lib/libpng12.so.0 (0x00007f3ff6450000)

Google tells lot about these two libraries,

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libjpeg
http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

I hope you will get the api documentation easily and start writing your 
code.

Cheers,
Mohan R

I am using reliance netconnect. The speed is very good in chennai,  
Bangalore, Salem. However it is slow in rural villages. I guess it  
works on Linux, though it is not officially supported. It has free  
roaming too.

Hi,

We used Inkscape to create this calendar.

The source svg files are available at

You are always welcome to add your changes.

Why are you looking code without library?

 I request you to use OpenCV .Intel has created an open-source (free!) image
processing library (OpenCV)that can be used by programmers who are writing
their own imaging application software. OpenCV will Support the following
image formats: BMP, DIB, JPEG, JPG, JPE, PNG, PBM, PGM, PPM,SR, RAS, TIFF,
TIF.

http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/
http://www.cs.iit.edu/~agam/cs512/lect-notes/opencv-intro/index.html

If you still want code without library . Take a look at  cvLoadImage OpenCV
function source code. The core libraries (cv, cvaux) are *written* in *C*/C++
.

Yea, that works but only for the current shell. Adding it to the bashrc file
should work universally though as Gourav pointed out.

Sorry I don't get you. What do you mean by "manually", because you can
use these tools for automation/scripts too. Also I don't understand the
point on "saving time".

It was coined by O'Reilly long ago and it originally referred to Linux, 
Apache, Mysql and Perl. Nowadays it refers to a stack as I have described. 
Some people misuse the term to specifically mean mysql+php.

I'm just curious. You say that you have copied the code from the net and
modified it to suit your purpose.

Yet you have released it under GPL in your name without providing a
reference to the orginal content. Isnt that unethical?

This is not to disprove your creativity, but just to get me more clear on

Try MozPlugger. It uses external programs to accomplish the task.

Opensis (*http://opensis*.com/) : It is a very interesting tool to start
with . It stared with postgresql as backend database but soon migrated to
Mysql with the aim to be intergrated with Moodle (http://*moodle*.org/ ).So,
its really cool to deploy both opensis and moodle and wait for the opensis
integration with moodle so that they both can have a SSO.

Also not to forget they have a SMS module (not included in the community
version) that can be used to inform the parents about their wards
performance, attendance and other things

2. Library management module.
>

Koha (http://www.*koha*.org/)
NewgenLib (http://www.verussolutions.biz/)

Koha no doubt is the best available solution but govt. committees have more
confiidence in Newgenlib (because of unknown reasons :P ) so better go for
Newgenlib if you have to take permission from one of these yes of library
committees.Also I am a bit doubtfull about the acquisition module of the
koha , someone told me that this module is a bit cumbersome as far as Indian
financial auditing policies are concerned

Also another important things to note here is that whether the staff and
student of that school will take it or not as login to all these services
are separate and it will be really painful for them to login into these
services separately.

You can also have a look at how HP govt. is going to implement this in all
its government school's in the coming time as deepak has told me long ago
that HP govt. is in process to have a Prop. solution for the same.

You may like to attend (http://www.eduexcellence.org) at IIT-Delhi.

sure, been using Linux for about 14 years now. Almost exclusively for

it a try sometime ( its almost exclusively the distro of choice for the
cloud providers )

my question wasent really confrontational at all. The problem that I,
and many many other people, have is that keeping content down to minimal
not only saves time but also makes it easier to stay focused.

my question to you, though, still remains unanswered - are you really
RHCE qualified ? And yes, I know whats in the test and I would expect
most people who have been through that test to be able to dig up exactly
what a cloud is. Also, did you look through the rhel4/5 docs and see
what components you might be able to use to set up something similar ?

The point that I tried, and mostly failed, to make here is that getting
the RHCE isnt something to be proud of - its only a starting step into
the enterprise computing on open source platform. Once you get in
through that door, it should set you up to be able to further learn and
deploy apps etc around. If you dont get the 'process', the certification
isnt really worth anything.

Y so? any specific reason? And it seems that setting up a cloud using
Eucalyptus / Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud has been easy. I haven't setup clouds
earlier. And neither have I tried CentOS. But what makes it the distro of
choice for cloud and how is it different from UEC? please clarify.

Once you get in through that door, it should set you up to be able to further learn and deploy apps etc around. If you dont get the 'process', the certification isnt really worth anything.

Just to add:-
It is not like what many have been chest beating in this list of late. 
Nobody is finding fault with the certification process.
Certification is meant to be a key to explore what is beyond the door. 
Most often we see is that people seal the door with a wall and hang the certificate.

***What is holding you back from registering at the site???***

Some sites require registrations to access the contents and participate 
in the forums.

> Please help me with some alternative..links..

IMO, you have already been helped.  What other help are you seeking?  
Application specific help is best available from the mailing 
lists/forums/wiki of the respective application.

I visited the above link; the registration page only wants a username,

is optional.

i think we can debate on this distro choice ;-)

Personally me being a heavy cloud user (we have more than 50+ servers in
cloud at the moment). I use ubuntu for a quick evaluation or testing (
www.alestic.com) but for deployment we use gentoo/funtoo. But its a fact
that lot of companies go with redhat/centos as enterprise deployment
solution. Ubuntu is slow to catch up the server side market with 9.10
release they have almost achieved better packaging for kernel and
hence future seems bright for ubuntu.

UEC == Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud == http://www.eucalyptus.com/

it help you to setup a private cloud, just that most of the things they do
is in sync with amazon ec2. in short we can say UEC is open source
implementation of amazon ec2.

what probably karan means is that since redhat/centos is enterprise ready
from long time lot of companies would be deploying it. At the moment i dont
have stats to prove this point tho.

FOSS is about meritocracy and if you dont know who Karanbir, googling helps.
Karanbir is a lead developer in the CentOS project which provides a
free version of RHEL which is not the same as "working for CentOS".
Most positions in open source projects are not paid jobs, which makes
them even more important in the eyes of the community.


Think you should also read the following before asking questions in a

BSNL EVDO speeds are very good within the city. At Ashok Nagar, i get a
minimum download speed of 50 KB/s and a max of 150 kb/s usually at night.
But the speeds vary with location(even in diff rooms) so it is better to
enquire the speeds in your area as well. If you have heavy downloads EVDO is
perfect, though browsing is slower because RTT of packets are very large
around 450 ms.

Why should i ask Google if i could ask him directly? In fact i got the
*polite* answer too. ;)

Will u ask Google, "Where is my food Google? " or "What should i do? its
boring now "  LOL ROFL

After all Google is a Search engine, we are much smarter.

Thank God, i got some common sense.

yes, i tried && also.

firefox -install-global-extension xyz.xpi && firefox &

Also i tried using a semicolon ";" between the two commands in a single
line.

firefox -install-global-extension xyz.xpi ; firefox &

It also didn't work.
also used sleep 5 between the two commands, so that the first command would
take its time to finish fully before the next firefox & loads.

firefox -install-global-extension xyz.xpi
sleep 5
firefox &

This also didnt install the extension.
But if i do manually, executing the two commands one by one, it installs
add-on extension into Firefox!!!

There was a slashdot post a couple of days back about boosting 3g signal
power. The video it linked to can be found here:

http://mobilebroadbandblog.co.uk/2009/12/the-craziest-way-to-boost-your-mobile-broadband-signal/

Can someone try this and inform us how useful this strategy is?

The original slashdot post itself is here:

You should read some basic PHP tutorials. Few here:

1. http://www.php.net/manual/en/index.php
2. http://www.codecoffee.com/tipsforlinux/articles2/037-php1.html

May be someelse can point out a good beginner PHP tutorial or book.

I would say 751 would be good enough.. or 753 .. Isn't 777 insecure? Unless
done in a local unconnected comp?

agreed. 9.10 needs some time though for some annoying bugs to be sorted out.

My curiosity is just "wat makes centOS a preferred distro over the others?".
I was wondering if there's any 'specific' reason behind it. I'd love to
know.

Yeah, 777 is insecure. But neither does 751 or 753 work when I try to view
the page in the browser, says permission denied.

"$ sudo chmod -R 755" works fine. Maybe I should've mentioned this instead.

Hi all,

In Linux box, http redirects to https and displays nothing.

apache server runs at 10.x.x.x when i type http://10.x.x.x

it automatically redirects to

https://10.x.x.x

How to avoid this  redirection?

Check your apache config. Or if it is some app that you downloaded,
see if they force https in their config. I knew a php app that could
do this.

Stable packaging, good tooling, highly competent admin and automation 
systems and the fact that it just works, and keeps on doing so for 
almost as long as people have apps on there.

the other benefit, more specific to the cloud argument, is that its just 
VM's running on larger iron. And the virt market has been almost 
completely built on and around centos, start from the vmware base to xen 
and openvz. KVM is now upstream native to EL. That pretty much covers 
the whole spectrum

btw, eucalyptus was mostly developed with CentOS ( or so I hear ).

it may seems that may be https is configured in ur apache server, or it may
be due to some application, which abhishek has pointed....just check out the
configuration file...and if possible just point out the lines which are
enabled in config file...let me know what is the problem and the possible
solution...

Hi,

Where? In apache config or in the application? How are you checking
this? Does some basic index.html that you place show correctly?

Because if I want to know about Mr Saravanan, I would rather trust
google than ask you.
Secondly you need to be smart enough to know what to ask google,
asking google about your food is your plain stupidity.

1. Any redirection in the header of index.html
2. Any port forwarding rule @ firewall
