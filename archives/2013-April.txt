For those who want to pursue master's education, and know about FOSS or
would like to dig deeper in this world, I would recommend this program.
IMHO there is no point doing a M.Tech. or any such other program, if you
know/love to live FOSSy life, as most of the time is spent, in finding
alternatives to non-FOSS stuff, normally taught in most of the these
courses ( something which happened with me, after I came to know about
FOSS, in 2nd year of my B.Tech. )

I am also a student of Batch 2, so if some one has some queries (if
there's something you can't find on [1]), can start a new thread, I will
be happy to share my experiences!

I am also doing it, recently gave a talk at #JDevDay, Jamia Millia
Islamia University, Delhi.

If there is any event (in Delhi/NCR), where you would like me to share
about the program, just mail me.

Or you can always spread the word about it and use this presentation[2].
I have tried to explain about the program by telling the 4 Freedom this
program gives!

We also have an unofficial mailing list[3].

PS: Anything related to FOSS, and obviously this program incomplete
without the inputs from the community, so please be a part of this
program, in whichever way you can, as a student, faculty, recruiter, see
[4] for more!

Yeah but the "terms and conditions"[1] is what IMHO makes this
interesting for us, at least:


For the 'apps' category it says

"All submissions to the ?apps? category have to created using ?open
source? software and APIs only."

"Each valid submission in the apps category will be made available on
www.data.gov.in under the GNU General Public License. Please visit
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html for more information"

and

for the creative works it says:

"Each valid submission in the visualizations and short films categories
and all submissions for UnCover the Event will be made available on
www.data.gov.in under the Creative Commons CC BY-SA 3.0 license. Please
visit http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US for more
information"

So I see it as a good start, at least those who come to know/participate
would also come to know that such good licenses, exist, and may be it
works as an opening to the Better ( Free world ) for some people!

Hi,

I see that sudosh is not available in centos 6.4 defualt repositories or

Why is sudosh not available. Is it a EOL or unsupported package?

Cultural Freedom Day is on 18th May'2013.
http://www.culturefreedomday.org/


Since most of India would be reeling under heat during the period. It might
help if we can organize a set of online activities instead.

Invade the cultural space with free software.

Friends.

I created a project in sourceForge for creating a software for Tamil Corpus
development.

https://sourceforge.net/p/sorkandu/

Interested people can join the project and check the tickets.

Here is the mailing list for the discussions.
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sorkandu-discussions/

We decided to develop this in python and django.

Thanks.

Why not in github? Github provides more features and is much easier to view

Subject: [Ilugc] How online shopping works
Message-ID: <CALDskyxzz1Ju43L3Tq5mY9xc2nnUmsYfBWoN+QcpHhGm8OkLdQ@mail.gmail.com>

The other day I wanted to buy a wallet and I thought:

Why not online?

And then voila.

Wasn't I pleasantly surprised at what Google gave me?

It was indeed very pleasing, amazing and excellent that I found
 not just one website but several companies offering
merchandize on the web.

Not just some ordinary website, but really integrated web based
 shopping cart application with integration into payment portals.

Not just that they have a fabulous website with multiple views of the
 product and dimensions, weight and so on(everything except video),
 they also have a live chat option and what I found was that
 when I was buying the product a guy offered to chat with me.

It was not intrusive, it was pleasant and they went a very long way
 towards earning the trust from a buyer and making a
 buyer really comfortable and at home.

Typical Indian hospitality which is sometimes lacking in business.

So I am going to talk about what all technologies went into making
 this online shopping experience meaningful, useful and worthwhile.

And also making money using technology.

I hate academia and the college project ideology and system
 administration mindset in LUG which are the evils preventing
 LUG members from achieving their full potential in life.

So my job is actually to encourage more and more people towards
 entrepreneurship and to go ahead and build product companies
after building the appropriate technical skills.

In order to create something that will sell you need to be really
serious. It is not a college project; it is not a joke.

It is a real world issue.

Any real world issue is hard to solve. That is why only few make money.

Now if you take the sellers who showed up in google for my query  for
 a wallet, there was zovi.com and there was bagskart.com.

I bought a wallet each from both guys.

And I think both these companies online presence was out of the world.

I thoroughly enjoyed it.

The real technical challenge or business challenge in building an online
 shopping site is integration with payment portal and listing the
 product with dimensions, photographs and customer reviews
 and sorting by price and so on.

But technology alone cannot succeed.

You need to be clued in with the real world.

We have a bigger problem. That of trust.

How to earn customer loyalty?

How does a random buyer called Girish sitting in Nellai get faith
 that if I spend 399 rupees for a purse I will actually get the purse in
 my hand( of course I did just now)?

To do that you need to use certain technologies.

And a thinking should go into the design of the website that listing
 the product alone and integration with payment gateway is not
quite enough.

You should have neat website with lot of photographs, you should
 provide the user with a lot of information, claims of 30 day
 moneyback or replacement, guarantee that the shipping will
 not take a lot of time and so on.

At every step you should get customer confidence.

Okay this mail is too long.

But you get the idea.

Always apply technology to the real world. Then only you can
 be successful in life.

I wish to quote this I read on FB.

"Education earns you livelihood. But self learning makes you a fortune."

Apply your knowledge what you studied in engineering and your
 career and help yourself.

No one can help you. Only you can.

God bless.

-Girish

Subject: [Ilugc] The design of the SMTP Proxy
Message-ID: <CALDskyy_7r2Kv2NvgGGyKWX1s4tEqVNpp4snXQ-CmJ+XEznaDA@mail.gmail.com>

Actually I am not sure if the heart of my product is actually a
 TCP proxy or an SMTP proxy.

I don't try to interpret SMTP commands beyond a point.

Actually it is an SMTP proxy. Yes.

It is so because I look at the 'DATA' command which
 actually sends out the headers and body of the mail and
 process it and then deliver it to the TCP pipe of the
 mail server or drop it sending an error 550 response code
 to the sending mail client.

A TCP proxy would only look at a TCP shutdown or so.

The design of my 3500 line C code is actually very very interesting.

It could be smaller since I have an auth socket which is actually
 not something I have implemented yet.

In these many lines of C code a lot of things happen.

It was not written easily or in a week or so.

It took I think around 2 months to write and to fix the most
critical bugs it took more than 4 months I think.

And it is only now that the code is production quality. So it
 has taken more than a year.

The larger aspects of the design which we in software parlance
 call as a 35,000 feet view itself is quite complicated and
 requires substantial technical knowledge.

Try discussing this with your manager in a big software company
and I can wager, nobody would be able to figure out what this means.

Anyway I will describe the parts:

*) Daemonize(chdir /, setsid, daemon(2) and so on)

*) fork() model for concurrent processing(hardest part)
 How to clean up and how not to crash your system

*) multiple sockets, UNIX domain, 3 TCP sockets, client and server

*) poll(2) based relaying in which you act as proxy, again hard

*) the real engine which reads, writes, creates temporary files
 using mkstemp() and does other munching, only the
 offset calculation when writing to a file is tough

*) the SMTP proxy part which does interpretation of SMTP commands
 like DATA, RECV FROM, HELO/EHLO

*) other features like passive OS fingerprint, invoking spam,virus check,
 SURBL analysis, SPF, DNS and so on

*) communication between multiple processes for keeping track of
 counters like mails rejected, total mail attempts, I used a UNIX
 domain socket, instead you could use shared memory. I think I
 first tried shared memory, but liked UNIX sockets better

*) Using linked lists to keep track of configuration parameters and
 iterate through lists of blocked mail IDs, doing network matching
  and blocked MIME types, attachments

*) Config file parsing at startup and reading it on SIGHUP signal

*) clearing the statistics counters everyday(using setinterval()
timer)

*) responding to statistics requests on a UNIX domain socket
 for the web interface

*) logging SMTP handshake using syslog

And so on.

Really easy eh?

For more than a decade, ILUG-C community and many of the volunteers
have taken strong and some serious efforts to bring the FOSS ecosystem
in the Higher Education in Tamilnadu and the result is, now many
colleges have started moving away from proprietary OS.

Today I was discussing with a engineering college Principal who is
also a FOSS enthusiast, made  clear that the students should be taught
the concepts/principles using Freely available software tools  and
there is no place for any proprietary software in his institution.
The similar kind of approach/mindset I have seen in many engineering
colleges I have visited.

And I am sure that India (from the education viewpoint) won't be
accepting shortsighted incentives or align itself with closed source
software vendors anymore.

This is a fake news.? But, for those who concern about future of FOSS:


	* FOSS was started as a movement by Richard Stallman.
	* GNU OS was developed, but only the kernel was missing.
	* Linus has developed the kernel, and named it as Linux.
	* FOSS is really a huge movement, which involves millions of developers.
	* Nobody can derail this movement by spreading these kind of fake messages.
	* FOSS movement CAN and WILL survive after the days of RMS and Linus.
	* Their names and the moral values they have created will grow forever.

We can organize an online exhibition of art using only free software.
But we need somebody to set up the web site.
 maybe the Mozilla groups?

Better use the term 'Free Software' instead of 'FOSS', as RMS is
really opposed to the term  'FOSS' when referring Free Software.

I believe Google customizes the search results for each user based on
their profile, search history, and the contents of their mailbox.

Google Search is a product that is provided to you by a company ie Google.
If you don't like it, you can switch to another product by a different
company.

With Google Search, you are not the customer, you are the product.
Google stores all kinds of data about you and mines it to benefit
their real customers.

Google tracks your search history, and the history of usage of all your
google products.
When you try to search for something, it suggests based on your history.
Not only this, they will also place ads nearby based on your search,
recently watched youtube videos and what not?

Nobody is going to look around this, when you signed up for google
services, you agreed for such things when you clicked 'I agree' in terms
and conditions, Privacy Policy <http://www.google.co.in/policies/privacy/>etc.
The are other search engines which donot track you, feel free to use them.
Try Duck Duck Go <https://duckduckgo.com/>.

I don't know what this statement means, but google's method of tracking and
delivering results is more accurate at giving you what you expect. And a
lot of us don't want to be tracked.

       1) Do not top post
       2) Do not quote/copy some random magazine(doesn't matter
whether it the Economist, or Time, or Forbes). I don't have a clue on
the "strategyless culture" that they talk about.  And this is going
way OT. But I will say this about the article -

    A super-power, in my opinion is a country, where (at least most)
of the living beings(not just humans) are properly fed, and have
proper health care, and above all have freedom(thought, expression
etc.). These three should not be a privelege of just the
econimically/politicaly well off.  Freedom is needed, not just in
sofware, but as part of life(in fact more so). I don't know if that is
true about China. But, I can see that there are at least some efforts
being made towards that(by govt., NGOs etc) and that's good enough.
Thanks

never heard back :(

Anyone in this list, from the aam aadmi/common man segment, laid your

This project is funded by Indian government, and as far I see its not open

<http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fmEi8gsOSFgOzSTFfLsw6J/Govt-almost-gives-up-on-Aakash-says-no-point-in-hardware-ob.html>
was an article that was published recently

" The government seems to have virtually given up onAakash, the $35
tablet computer that was once billed as India?s low-cost solution for
bridging the divide between digital haves and have-nots.
?Let?s not get obsessed with hardware,? human resource development
(HRD) minister M.M. Pallam Raju said on Friday. ?The overall (issue)
is how we enable students. Let the students decide which device is
useful.?
It?s up to the users to choose the device they want to access content
with, said Raju, adding that the government?s role is that of an
enabler.
His remarks at a news conference in New Delhi seemed to have all but
shut the door on Aakash, a device championed by his predecessor, Kapil
Sibal, now minister for communications and information technology, who
proposed providing it at a subsidized price to students."

"I recommend standardizing on a GNU/Linux distribution, preferably of
Ubuntu lineage. If desired, a national distribution might be created."

There exist well documented security standards
<http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/os/unix/red_hat.html> for example which
can be readily adopted. This concept of a "national distribution" has
been mulled over for at least the past 6 years. Creating a
distribution is remarkably easy - in fact, all it takes is a manifest
file for packages you'd want in and, a set of customizations you'd
want. It is creating the entire set of ISV applications,
certifications, support, security audit that is the expensive part of
the gambit.

"A national distribution" is a fallacy that ends up wasting a lot of
money, making unfortunate noise and, being completely worthless.
Highly secure installations run their custom versions of distributions
and, follow remarkable lock-down principles. Meanwhile, you should
also take a look at <http://www.isecom.org/research/osstmm.html>

Dear sankarshan,

Thanks for the highly insightful and informative response to my article.
I respectfully disagree with your suggestion that a national distribution
is a worthless concept.
You are correct to point out that highly secure installations should run
custom distros, and follow lock-down policies.

However, I am talking about bringing the entire machinery of government to
a pragmatic level of security.
Hence a national distribution is not such a bad idea, IMHO.

Read this article on how China is doing it, and why India should follow
suit.

I look forward to hearing from you, either on this channel, or privately.

Best Regards,

- Ashwin.

Here goes.

When you create a "distribution" you are essentially creating a
derivative or, a spin. In effect, you are taking an existing
distribution (Ubuntu, in your original premise) and, customizing it to
suit your needs and policies. Now, this is something that BOSS Linux
has been doing (albeit with Debian I believe).

So, creating a derivative is remarkably easy and inexpensive. My
previous email stated that. However, once you create a derivative,
and, you want to mandate it as a "national distribution", you'll have
to test the entire build for any defects. In effect, you will have to
maintain a test framework and, staff. Now, let's assume that you have
tested out things and, would want to make it widely available. Your
distribution is going to have to be installed on hardware. So, you
have to sign up hardware partners who'd need to agree to test "yet
another distribution" and, maintain staff to undertake certification.
Which brings forth another question - what is the cadence of the
release cycle - that would determine how often the partners have to
re-certify the hardware. Having taken care of the hardware, let's move
to software. I will assume that a "national distribution" would be
utilized in various Govt of India projects - you need applications and
ISVs. Most e-gov applications are from the TWITCH (TechMahindra,
Wipro, Infosys, TCS, Cognizant, HCL) group. They'd need to ensure that
their application build, integration and testing system build for your
platform as well (just because it is based on Ubuntu doesn't
necessarily mean that you can leverage their Ubuntu builds and claim
"certified). That's another layer of staff and cost. Finally, you will
have to staff for maintaining a team to respond to user defects and
enhancement reports - even if all the team does is push the bugs
upstream into Ubuntu. Beyond this, a national distribution would mean
that CERT-IN would have to track another line-item for security
vulnerabilities. Plus you'd want to probably certify for
CommonCriteria etc and thus you'll need staff.

The government should provide a consultative approach to develop and
free and non-restrictive set of guidelines for Linux distributions to
certify against. Some guidelines exist and, others can be developed
and made available. A reference distribution can be made available so
that data for benchmark runs can be collected. Unless there's a very
fascinating reason, the GoI should probably stay out of the business
of Linux engineering. It would be wonderful to have the GoI get
involved in incubating applications for various services instead of
the current state of fragmentation eg. each state has its own NIC
home-brewed land records application and so on.

Stop being a troll  "Jab aankh khule tabhi savera!"  in your case , they
had something known as Redflag Linux before too , also our own CDAC has a
distro by the name BOSS, i do not know how much are you aware of the
fallout between the community and the so called Govt and Quasi Govt
organizations in India.

there was a mention of one such operating system
http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-09/software-services/28252646_1_drdo-saraswat-defence-research
way
back in 2010 .

yes this idea is not worth pursuing even if you want to help and support ,
 NIC uses and supports Free software . so what is that radical you are
proposing i still fail to follow ?

Ah! Thank you for that link. ""We have to protect it (data)," Saraswat
said, adding, "Only way to protect it is to have a home-grown system,
the complete architecture...source code is with you and then nobody
knows what's that." He said DRDO is putting in place a dedicated team
of 50 software professionals in the Bangalore and Delhi software
development centres to accomplish the task."

Subject: [Ilugc] Little crypto
Message-ID: <CALDskyx8U3wagtiK_LvCaFDJhZKgK2v0xfP3W1WX6Urk3At=vw@mail.gmail.com>

Crypto is something I left long ago.

But it is still in my bloodstream since I dabbled with it for a very long
time.

Basically crypto is not the only way to implement security.

It is a very important building block but not the only one.

We find that authentication algorithms and protocols normally employ
 crypto. We find crypto in integrity checks or preserving the data
 from being tampered. And of course we employ crypto in confidentiality
or encryption.

There are many things that do not at all depend on crypto.

If you are doing biometric scanning or facial recognition or voice
recognition
 then some crypto may be there in the form of doing a match
 against the fingerprint or message digest.

But crypto as is generally understood is used for encryption when we
 use SSL, VPN(secure one, we can have VPN without security)  or SSH.

Encryption is used for protecting the data from being seen.

You also have file system encryption and you can even encrypt a file
 using vim or openssl.

Anyway crypto alone does not ensure security.

If a machine does not have physical security then any amount of
 crypto will not save it.

One can always get to it in single user mode and reset the root password.

The most important component of crypto at a serious level is a
sound random number generator.

At a simpler level the most oft used method is a message digest
 algorithm like MD5 or SHA1.

All complicated crypto systems employ message digest in one form
 or other.

Message digest itself is not secure. Once you add a secret key to
 it it then becomes HMAC and that is secure.

But message digests can be encrypted with a cipher like AES
 and then used.

PKI implementation uses crypto in the form of RSA, DSA or ESS
 and also uses message digest and finally a symmetric cipher
 like AES or DES3.

Educational Institutions seems be the first hindrance to spread
the use of Free Software where a large number of students learn
to use the computer.

Recently I had an argument with my college senior staff about
their indirect promotion of Wind0w$.

She told
" We are not promoting it. We are just comfortable with it and  hence
we use it ".

I asked, " What is your problem in using free software that can make
you accomplish the same task ? "

she told
" Every Institution has its own standard, and Wind0w$ is standard for
our institution.
  you have no rights to question us why ! "

and I was disappointed when she told this,
"Moreover Anna University ( to which the college is affiliated ) has
clearly given the option
to opt Wind0w$ as lab requirements (http://goo.gl/gJxKS) "

Syllabus is controlled by the university, and all its affiliated
colleges are following its norms.
Since the university itself indirectly promoted the proprietary
software , I can't speak anymore.

 If someone here able to pass this message to Anna University
 please do it and bring some change in its norms.

PS: ( until then I will be forced to use non-free software which I can't bare )

Do you use google's DNS? 8.8.8.8 and 4.4.4.4? If your answer is yes,
then you already know that even if you don't login to google's services,
they will customize youtube videos based on your website freequency.
That means, In a current session, what kind of websites the user try to
access etc.,

One example I have seen is with rpm2cpio command. We use this to extract an
RPM into a cpio file. The command goes like this,

rpm2cpio < <some RPM file> > archive.cpio

i.e, it takes an RPM through input redirection and sends out a cpio through
output redirection.

Eg. 
1.Suppose you store some sql comands in a file then you can use input redirection in mysql like this
$  mysql dbname <sqlcommanfile

2. Using you use input redirection in bc. Store the commands in a file and run bc like this
 
    $ bc <yourfile

Hello Abdul,

Yes, in shared server the ruby version and gems may not be the one that
suits fedena. Its better you have a dedicated bo of your own or a VPS.

As a student you don't have enough rights to question them.  Staff's
who feel comfortable with Proprietary software were never against Free
software.  The only thing required is to educate, train and support
them.

If you wish, I can speak to them and can even make them to understand
the importance of Free software, if you provide the details of your
college and staff to me privately.

In India, colleges are controlled by Universities and our Universities
are acting as agents of Proprietary software companies to promote
their products.  Colleges who knows this very well are keeping silent,
as they say, they can't do anything against University as  they are
affiliated.  So we can't blame colleges in this matter.

So far I have initiated the FOSS migration process in more than 200+
engineering colleges in Tamilnadu and got good results / feedback and
I personally feel that, the best way to bring the change is to
directly approach colleges instead of going with University.

If you don't wish to see this happening anymore, you should not bare,
instead you have fight against this.

         Should the solution be definitely tied to Drupal ? If not,
you can try Fedena[1]. It is a school/college management software,
written in RoR. You can have your school website separately, and link
this fedena from the website. I remember another thread going on in
the list about setting it up. That too would be useful in case you are
going with it.  Thanks

That approach will only yield partial results as the rot necessarily
starts from above.
If the syllabus is rot then the spine of colleges is already broken.

Hi,

I recently crossed upon a old article in gnu.org. RMS recommends the 
following distros in the webpage http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-
distros.html .
BLAG
Dragora
Dynebolic
gNewSense
Musix GNU+Linux
Parabola
Trisquel
Ututo

Has anyone used them ? How usable is it ?

I searched on distrowatch for reviews, but it provided only package list 
and some raw statistics. No reviews.

Did you try "Fedena"? Is it one of the very popular solutions in the
open source world for what you are looking for.

> [ kindly avoid "web search results" as answers , I desired to have suitable
> solution from people with hands-on experience  ]

"web search results" was not suggested as an answer. Balachandran even
pointed out that there was a discussion in this list some time back
regarding setting up Fedena.

If you have indeed tried "Fedena" and all the other open source
software that comes up in the search engine results, then the best bet
would be to write your own solution - stand-alone or integrating with
Drupal, or in the worst case, you could write a small script in your
favorite scripting language that reads the data from a CSV file and
creates a Drupal page with all the data in it.

Your top posting suggests otherwise. The recommended style of posting
on this list is interleaved, trimmed posting. I'd recommend you go
through the mailing list guidelines, if you haven't already -

Some more examples:

$ gzip -c </etc/passwd >passwd.gz
  this will compress /etc/passwd file and generates a new compressed
file passwd.gz

$ cat </dev/urandom >/dev/sdb1
  NOTE: DONT TRY THIS UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING. This
command will randomize bytes in your USB drive (or second hard drive) so
that data will be thrashed. I think no forensic tool can recover the

Since the cost for fedena is beyond my limitations [ $200 and $ 600 per year

Drupal modules are easy for me to install and configure. Also I can not

Mohan R,

Thanks for your very educational response!
I have a small question. Mohan, or anyone else, please feel free to answer.
Some programs expect an argument on the command line. Others read from
whatever stream is piped into them.
What's the difference between?

cat foo.txt

cat < foo.txt

If the above means:
    every parent has a login to the drupal site (or can be given one)
Then:

1. Generate a web page per student and upload them
using say a python/ruby program.
2. In the drupal site add a page that uses the login info
to direct them to the right html page--setting up an association
between the page name and the login id.

We can explain this by simple C++ program.

The following program will get two numbers and print the addition.
$ more test_args.cpp
#include<iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  int a=0,b=0;
  std::cout << "Enter First Number : ";
  std::cin >> a;
  std::cout << "Enter Second Number : ";
  std::cin >> b;
  std::cout << "Addition of these two numbers : " << a + b << "\n";
  return 0;
}

You can run this program as follows for the values 40 and 20, it will print
60.
$ ./test_args.out
Enter First Number : 40
Enter Second Number : 20
Addition of these two numbers : 60

There is a text file which has this 40 and 60 value inside.
$ more test_args.txt
40
20

You can pass this text file to this program to get these values.
$ ./test_args.out < test_args.txt
Enter First Number : Enter Second Number : Addition of these two numbers :
60

This kind of approach will be very useful when we want to run the same
program with different data. Even with this we can automate to run a
program with different data.

If you still have any queries, please let me know.

Thanks,

Fedena is a Free/Libre Open Source Software

the support and the whistles and bells that come with buying a
cloud-hosted and managed installation.

Is it possible that this be conducted online using *something like* webex
?  In that case I guess more people would log in from their home and we
will have greater audience.

This kind of suggestions were raised in the past.
The joy of ilugc meetings are lectures, personal interactions and canteen.
IMPO, 'Each one catch one'  ( I mean bringing the near and dear ones to
ilugc meeting) will be good for the purpose of meeting  :).

This list could be used by anyone wishing to make a case for Open-Source
Software.
You might not agree with all of it, but I would like to hear your views.

You write

"How should India use Open-Source Software?


1. Create a national Operating System distribution derived from Ubuntu Linux.

2. Mandate the use of the national distribution for all branches of
government, and in public education.

3. Teach only non-proprietary programming languages in the Computer
Science curriculum."

We had a discussion on #1 which didn't see much participation from
you. For the rest, you may also want to read

They will work fine.
You can also install freedora kernel in fedora.

The differences will crop up in some hardware that requires blobs for
enhanced functionality.

Check your use of blobs first.

While creating a national Linux distribution is an expensive and complex
task, IMHO the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
It's hard, not impossible!

Creating a distribution/spin/derivative is remarkably easy. If you
conclude as you did, then I have totally failed in my explanation. I'd
like to understand more as to why you think creating a distribution is
imperative when contrasted to creating policies, frameworks and, being
able to provide incentive for adoption of those.

+1 - exactly, because it is not expensive and because it is easy and
smart to fork from existing work - Open Source is the first choice! Do
not invent the wheel twice! Of course besides all the other aspects like
transparency, freedom and security.

As example, i maintain the OSSTMM Lab as a Fork from the Fedora Security
Lab completely alone and the Fedora Security Lab as a official Fedora
Spin is maintained by Fabian Affolter and me - in part-time work, also
not much efforts - right? [1]

I am moving and watching around in indias non-profit and open source
eco-system since a while, i see that there is a trend in missing the
benefits of Free and Open Standards and Open Source Software by blowing
up the projects with big tamtam, management-overhead, building board of
directors (who just do nothing, not even the lobbying the are hired for
;)) and by building huge marketing around it, before the product itself
is near a state to become attributable etc. etc.

In the Open Source Security Eco System in Europe there are even
scammer-warnings about some india non-profits who make nice
marketing-face to just wash their black-money or to receive fundings
from the government and from entities outside of India. In no way i
imply this is your intention!!! But ganeshacomputes, if you really want
to bring your idea to fly, build a prototype, show it to the people,
teach them, have some success stories. And if it is really good - your
sponsor will show up!

You question itself have answer, you are passing the file as "argument",

$ cat testfile.txt

and you are passing the file as "standard input",

$ cat < testfile.txt

Its all depends on how the program (in this case 'cat') has been
written. You can write your program to get input file from argument as
well as get input file from stdin.

Here is a simple example:

Mycat.bash:
------------
#!/bin/bash
test "${#}" -le "0" && INPUTDATA=$(cat) || INPUTDATA=$(cat "${1}")
echo "${INPUTDATA}"


$ chmod 755 ./Mycat.bash
$ cat > testfile.txt
hello world
$ Mycat.bash testfile.txt
hello world
$ Mycat.bash < testfile.txt
hello world
$

Some people dont have time to attend Ilugc meetings, and they dont have
time. For them atleast why cant we use to share Webex Recording sessions .
Those who are active in ILUGC can please record their sessions through
webex and share their webex recordings to lug members ...


Is it my idea worthable ?

G+ Hangouts on air (on YouTube!) are another option.

I would expect any reasonable write up to work out the details and
relate to existing material.

See  http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html

With only OSS the entire ecosystem will collapse under the existing
market order.

Why create a national Linux distribution?
Why not just adopt a set of standards and loose guidelines, and create
incentives for OSS adoption?
Why not let the best of breed solution emerge bottom-up, rather than be
forced top-down?
Why not choose FreeBSD for that matter?

1. Fragmented package managers: There are too many different package
managers and package formats. e.g., rpm and pkg
Choosing one distribution eliminates that confusion.

2. Application compatibility: We want to catalyze the application
ecosystem. We want applications to run everywhere without hassle.
The national distribution will help that goal.

3. Domestic security audit: The whole point of creating the national distro
is so that Indian programmers can vet the Ubuntu source-code for
vulnerabilities.
It's not that we don't trust the international community. Pragmatically
speaking, domestic due diligence is necessary with any technologies we
adopt.

4. Scope for future internationalization of applications. I want to see
applications internationalized and reused in China, and India, and
elsewhere.
If we're all using Ubuntu, and following the same I18N practices, this goal
is achievable.

5. Reduce government waste:  The government, trying to create indirect
incentives for adoption of OSS will make a bureaucratic mess of things.
Having an unambiguous standard, codified in the form of the national
distribution, may be the more efficient way.

Hence, I conclude: "One distribution to bind them all!"

You can. As long as you can get application vendors to certify against
FreeBSD with the release cycle cadence.

Or, it locks you down to a choice you made attempting to solve the
problems in *now* timespace.

Again, it will not. Application vendors want to limit the lines of
distributions they certify against. Certification is expensive,
time-consuming. Adding a new distribution/line-item is frowned upon.

Both large and small ISVs provide archives, debs and rpms of the
package. Some bundle in their own installer.

To undertake a domestic security audit you will first require a
domestic security guide. Once you have that guide - it is a matter of
interest for distributions to comply with it.

i18n and l10n works best when it is upstream. If you create a silo,
what you get is what happened with BOSSLinux - a very fine, well
funded private garden of contributions.

A standard/guide/policy is not equivalent to a national distribution.

Hmm...

China has a national distro, and it's making me envious for India.
If they can do it, why can't we?
Granted, China is more homogenous than India.
They value consensus in China. We value diversity in India.

One distribution to cater to every need might turn out to be a mega
monolith -- just as the  proprietary group tend to do: even if you want
only two tasks to be done, they are bundled with 200 other things. this
leads to increase in cost, up/run time, etc.

of course, one mega repository of the distribution with structured
interfaces can go a great way. the issues there will be how to comfortably
download, customise and bundle packages for the specific user group. an
average user cannot do this, and this might be an opportunity for
intermediate/expert FOSS members to offers their services. such
intermediaries can take it from the global repositories!

srinivasan.

Problem is not with camera or technology or idea. Who will do it is the question. Anyone who has time and necessary knowhow is welcome to do it.

As I repeatedly emphasis 'physical volunteer' is what is required. We have too many ideas/suggestions/plans/roadmap/milestones/todo/goals ... but too little volunteers.

Problem is not with camera or technology or idea. Who will do it is the question. Anyone who has time and necessary knowhow is welcome to do it.

As I repeatedly emphasis 'physical volunteer' is what is required. We have too many ideas/suggestions/plans/roadmap/milestones/todo/goals ... but too little volunteers.

An elearning organization is building a product using FOSS.

They are looking for an `architect'. Please contact me off-list if you
think you would like to discuss your profile.

Some of the skills needed:

Experience in FOSS development
Knowledge of sufficient range oof technologies and toolchains -- "Everying
you need can be done using {Django|RoR|Lisp}" is not likely to resonate
with them.
Ability to relate client requirements at a design and architecture level
Cloud experience
Good communication and presentation skills
Preferably product experience

Hi ,

As Google search result is based on Google PageRank() algorithm, which have
many parameter and google is adding per year basis.
so result vary based on the input parameter.
In your case :considerable parameters are
1. keyword (same)
2. network, internet etc.( same)
3. browsing History of browser (different for different person)
   Google store without login browser history for (180days) mapped with
browsers
  if you are logged in then google will store your browsing history for
always.

so search result varies due to browsing history parameter.


Hope it will be useful for better understanding google it.
and let me know the your search output.

AFAIK, broadly, there are three parts to the command:
1. What to do: the command itself -- e.g. ls
2. With what: Command line parameter(s) -- e.g. ls / -- here '/' is the
parameter(s) which is usually 'the' stream
3. How to do: Command line options -- ls -al / -- here '-al' is the option
and '/' is the parameter

Now (2) can be replaced with a stream and that is where '<' operator is
used.

I realise above is too simplistic for the erudite members of this list.

I did see a post using c++, but I felt that for noob it would be too much:
like a chicken and egg problem IMHO.

Hope the above helps,

Samsung Galaxy Camera (GC100) may be? Runs on Android, it would be root(able) I guess.

Subject: [Ilugc] Editor and efficiency
Message-ID: <CALDskyyE8SzvRiGM_kvhjfkG1omhQWeCC2Z3GW0ptA0JVa+68Q@mail.gmail.com>

Perhaps you are aware I am a big votary of vim. I can use vi too but I
prefer vim.

I wrote my final year project report using emacs but after my fingers
started aching or rather humorously I graduated from using emacs
 to using vim.

So my love affair with UNIX is rather very very old. Even in those
 days when colleges did not have too many software savvy people
 I was familiar with UNIX,Linux, editing and so on.

I was also familiar with the SMTP protocol and I have written automatic
 mailing software back then. Today after around 15 years I still do
 the same thing.

E-mail software has become part of my bread winning strategy and
 lifestyle be it preventing spam or managing mail.

Now back to editing.

I edit plain text all the time. Be it a PDF document or a HTML document
 or a mail. I am always dealing with text.

I don't use WYSIWYG editors. And a programmer uses an editor
 as part of the IDE or he just uses an editor to type in his code.

So whether you are writing code or mail or creating a website an editor
 is critical.

Just like we use UNIX and a language proficiency to improve our efficiency
 we can use editors to improve our effectiveness of editing.

In that endeavor a very pivotal role is played by a very powerful editing
 software like vim.

One could use vi too but vim is much better in my opinion.

You have syntax highlighting, support for regular expressions, scripting
 and various mouse operations(gvim) and selection with 'v' and so on.

Vi also has many of these but due to this vim depends on other shared
 libraries, so under certain situations vim may not work.

There is also another really geeky line editor called ed.

I have used ed also on occasions but that is more for restricted use.

An editor improves your ability to get your job done and usually knowing
 a really powerful editor can improve your efficiency and save you time
 a lot more than knowing other tools.

Investment of time and effort and memorizing is essential for effective
 software mastery and editing is a very important activity in that scheme
 of things.

Type

:help

in vim or use vimtutor and get going!

OT or not, the vote itself is definitely pointless!

Whe it comes to achievement, its tesla. He invented the modern world. But
when it comes to helping humanity, both. Both gave away their crucial works
for free even though it would have earned them  a lot.

Can you let us know the application?
For still photography, an embedded Linux board + gphoto2 + imagemagick will
let you convert most commercial (Canon and Nikon) point-and-shoot and DSLRs
into powerful Linux controlled devices.

The end of this what you will get is a result of who has more fanboys.

People who vote are you, me and other common netizens, there are
voters who have never heard of tesla and looked up wikipedia at the
last moment, there are Linus worshippers, Linux haters, and somany
nongeek voters.
So its not to be taken seriously.

Since the network is within your control, use nmap to find out if the port
is really open. What if you run the same command on the 10.242.142.71
machine? Does that work?

Telnet to localhost only shows that the service is running. Check you
iptables to see if connections are allowed on the standard telnet port
or any other port you are running the service on. By default, all
incoming connections will be denied.

It will be a webcam or any HD cam having 5-12 MP lens. I need to program it
in a way i can use it for video streaming,  taking still shots for a time

This can be done with:

Hardware stack: Raspberry pi + HD webcam
Software stack: ffmpeg for streaming + uvccapture for stills

For basic uses, no programming is necessary - you can just cook up a shell
script to stream videos or to capture and upload images.

I have tried this with a Microsoft HD Cinema webcam. Interestingly
Microsoft makes wonderful hardware :) Almost all their hardware.

A warning though - the Raspberry pi will reach it's limit at 720p. If you
are looking at full HD capture and streaming with h.264, the pi has not got
the brute force to do a software encode. Actually it has got a hardware
h.264 engine which you can unlock by buying a license @ ~$2. Unfortunately
ffmpeg nor any other media app at the moment does not have a driver for
this.

Subject: [Ilugc] More on e-mail protocols
Message-ID: <CALDskyzF60RgRaxb5i2JF6mczM4suDkS3j8R+pB3qLzc7cZ+NQ@mail.gmail.com>

E-mails are becoming increasingly important in a world of connected phones and
 computers and laptops.

Be it a phone or a tablet or a spacecraft the e-mail protocol works using SMTP
 and its sister protocols like IMAP4, POP3 and underlying TCP layer.

Not much has changed and spam control technologies, e-mail sending and receiving
 has more or less been the same in the last 20 years time.

However I do find that gmail nowadays uses TLS, thereby encrypting the
mail on the wire.

SMTP authentication protocols are used in MS Outlook but if you use
webmail then the backend
 may use it. You are not really aware.

SMTP or e-mail protocol is a simple text based handshake involving
encoded text even for binary attachments
 like video or PDF.

These days you also find UTF8.

But to transact mail it better be 7 bit ASCII.

The conversions for MIME and encoding happens on the fly.

You don't have a lot of complexity in the basic scheme of things.

A mail flows by when you identify yourself, the IP and domain of the
sender, the from address, to address,
 the mail body has the subject and headers and then you say bye with a
"." on the starting line.

For example, this is how you send mail on a UNIX command line.

$ mail booty
Subject: How are you?

I am just testing, ignore.
.
$

So you see?

You terminate the mail with a "." (fullstop) at the beginning of a line.

On the wire side of things the SMTP protocol also does the same thing.

You type a mail in Outlook or webmail then you click send,the mail
server you are connected to collects
 the mail and transmits and terminates the sending with a full stop.

If you attach a lot of images then your mail message becomes a MIME
encoded text.

It has various sections demarcated by a random string like:

-sdlfijalfdkjslfkjsldkfjdslfkjsldjjjjjjjjjjjjj-

Content-type: image/png
...
..

-sdlfijalfdkjslfkjsldkfjdslfkjsldjjjjjjjjjjjjj-

Content-type: audio/mpeg

-sdlfijalfdkjslfkjsldkfjdslfkjsldjjjjjjjjjjjjj-


Like that.

On the receiving side, the mail server stores the mail without interpretation.

It could run virus scanning or spam control.

But you receive mail in your inbox or web mail by using a protocol
called IMAP or POP3.

These are LDA, local delivery agents.

And the mails are stored in the mail server using what is called maildir format.

Each mail is stored in three directories, new/ , /tmp and /cur

These directories facilitate locking when writing to the mail spool/queue.

The old idea of storing all mails in one single file(mbox format) with
the From: line demarcating
 is not a good idea. It does not scale.

In the maildir idea pioneered by Dan Bernstein the mails are stored in
its own individual files.

When a mail client reads them using IMAP, the client interprets the
mail MIME encoding and
 extracts attachments.

Even HTML mail is  encoded.

Message-ID: <CAFZPT6ZLoxZvxhDQSiqW3jQtR=R72tZShJo66-YwP7+85pwaQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I came to know about this when my alma mater, Thiagarajar College of
Engineering where we have been running our own mail servers with just
free software was asked to migrate to AICTE by pointing the MX records
to some domain of Microsoft.

Here is the release from AICTE -
http://www.aicte-india.org/downloads/AICTE_notice.pdf

Here is an article about this on Microsoft's site -
http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Microsoft-Office-365/All-India-Council-for-Technical-Education/India-Institute-Deploys-7.5-Million-Office-365-Seats-to-Improve-Governance-Learning/710000002268

It already seems to be too late to do anything about this, or is
something possible.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Ohh no , isn't that sick of AICTE to say its mandatory ?

I just felt like reading http://www.aicte-india.org/aboutaicte.htm to
see what they are all about ! But as community members we must do
something to prevent this onslaught .
I am guessing this is a country wide thing .

It felt really rude to me. What about the existing infrastructure that
the colleges have? Do they even offer a proper migration? What if the
government changes after the elections and some one decides that this
project should be scrapped? What will happen to the data that lies in
the control of Microsoft? What if after some time Microsoft decides
that it is not worth giving this service for free and decides to
charge per user? Will they offer a way for people to export the data?
Is changing the MX records just the only thing they expect from the
colleges and do they expect all colleges to blindly oblige?

I came to know about this only when there was a point-blank email to
my alma mater asking to change the MX records and point them to a
subdomain of invalid.outlook.com within a couple of days' time. Since
the email came from one of the partners of Microsoft, I even suspected
that this could be scam email and that AICTE website could have been
compromised. But after I saw an article on the Microsoft site gloating
about its largest cloud customer, I realized the enormity. I am
surprised to see how this hasn't come out big in the news or have all
colleges budged?

Guruprasad

Totally agree,  PIL requires money (court fee+lawyer fee) and
compilation of facts (time+money).

   1. May be on the following lines:
   2. What are all the other options considered by AICTE
   3. Who are all the other Vendors whose services are not comparable with
   that of MS.
   4. What are all the Fees/Charges incurred from Public Money.
   5. Is this Lifetime free account or at certain point in time this will
   be changed in to Paid account
   6. Event if it's free there are implications as MS can dictate terms to
   use other services of their and ask them to pay by Slave Methods which they
   did it in PC Era.
   7. Was there any Committee formed to study and recommend?

There can be more.. expect from other members. Also We can ask through RTI
these Questions from AICTE before PIL can be mooted.

Excellent beginning. I have heard that the Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) lets a citizen ask specific questions of the government.
The government is obligated to answer within a fixed time. Does anyone else
have any experience with FOIA?

Please don't try to work it out alone. Raise it with FSF-India and other
active FSF/L UG. I hope, each one of us will have some contact with other
LUG members, plz join hands with them and go together. Damage is already
done and commissions might be distributed. So need more focused effort to
undo/stop it.

Like Basker, who ever is having some close contact with education
institution, need to understand the back ground and share more insight.

Bye :)

+1 lets all put up a collective effort . Lets involve all LUGs
nationwide. There is also a legal team called Software Freedom Law
centre (SFLC) http://sflc.in/

Hope someone can help us from there . Lets also use petition websites
and create a petition get it signed by as many people as possible .
Also circulating the petitions to LUGs etc would help .

Pavithran

The drawback which I have noticed in this tablet is that (Am not using this
tablet, just got to know from the specification)

Does not have Micro SD card slot and there is no rear camera (only front
camera is there)

The affiliated colleges are very well aware about these relationships
and don't care much about all these.  These relationships has done
enough damage to our education system in the past and these are not
new to our colleges.

As our education system has started moving to Linux / Open source
software, the proprietary software major has started doing all evil
things to stop that by joining hands with AICTE / Universities in
India.

We need not do anything to undo/stop it.  As most colleges have
started moving away from proprietary operating system (especially in
the case of TN), a lot of damage has already happened to the
proprietary software vendor.  Now, they are just attempting to
slowdown the Linux / FOSS migration process in education.

Camera and all doesn't matter, I'm not looking for a tablet for general
purpose.

I need a tablet to play around with MultiROM, Recovery and
ArchLinux/Bodhi/UbuntuTouch and possibly upcoming Linux Distros for ARM.

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=34577851
Link to know more about "MultiROM", "Recovery" if you don't know
already.

Thanks,
Mohan R

I guess you can go with Indian brands for  this kind of work. Mostly they
are replica of some chinese mobile / tablet so doing a search could get you
there. They come with stock Android rooted. I am not aware of the
bootloader but I guess it should be possible. The reason for choosing
Indian brands is that they are cheaper and have more peripherals so you can
play with more peripherals for less cost :).

Hope this helps,
Prasanna Kumar

<snip>

With so many students approaching Project Centers to get <sniptheir final
year projects done, by just paying money, we were disappointed.. What's the
point of being a college graduate if one can't even come out with a project
at the end of a 3/4/5-year college education..? Our inference was straight:
Most of the students flunked, when it came to handling stuff practically
and colleges cared less about it.

That's when we thought and came out with this Program: A 30 hour long
Exciting training course in Embedded Systems using Arduino. This course has
been tailor-made to give you complete hands-on exposure to embedded systems
and building prototypes. The course focuses on extensive project based
learning methodology with a special focus on interfacing different types of
hardware ? sensors, actuators, displays & other devices (GSM, ZIGBEE, IR
Remotes, etc.)

Subject: [Ilugc] unix and linux
Message-ID: <CALDskyzbTUhjN1_qtEYoOO_zYx=6qkoFeMzPACV5w8Hwt+6b5A@mail.gmail.com>

Lot of people seem unclear about whether at all there is UNIX today.

And people think that other than Linux or Ubuntu or whatever there is
nothing else and
 that Linux is a new form of UNIX and that UNIX is dead.

The confusion is understandable since unless one is really curious and
has the ability to
 learn on their own and is confident enough to think for oneself such
ideas do not enter
 one's consciousness. Or you need a really good teacher in one of your
semesters in college.

Having handled corporate trainings and having dealt with engineers I
feel that people are generally not
 equipped to learn on their own and the curiosity and real interest
towards technology, engineering and
 programming is lacking.

But then our IT industry also is responsible for it but you cannot
blame external factors for the attitude of
 a bunch of people.

Okay, so Linux is really not new UNIX or a derivative of it though
both are somewhat true too.

Linux has found lot of interest from hackers and a lot of UNIX ideas
can be found in Linux.

And UNIX is not dead. It will never die.

It gets absorbed and you can see its presence in various forms not
only in Linux but also in Windows.

There is Cygwin, MingW and many others in Windows world and even
Windows NT apparently has some
 Posix ideas though I am not sure if that is really true.

So instead of thinking of UNIX as an OS it serves to think of UNIX as
a philosophy or a foundation.

And in today's world all the BSDs are UNIX OSes and Solaris,
OpenSolaris, HP UX, AIX and few others are
 also being used here and there.

There is also no idea of distribution in the world outside Linux.

When you take common embedded systems, routers, firewalls, mail
servers, load balancers and even telecom equipment they
 all run some form of Linux or UNIX.

In a veiled form UNIX always exists.

Linux is not going to kill UNIX ever. And UNIX users are not going to
switch to using Linux instead.Everything has a place of its own.

And one can be equally comfortable with both since there are plenty of
similarities.

AFAIR, there was a clause to use FLOSS in the AICTE Compliance manual
2005=2008 (which I think was encouraged by our ex-President Dr. APJ Abdul
Kalam). I answered the "Inspection committee" who knew bollocks about
measurements of classrooms, let alone Information technology.

One can't expect any cretin to understand these nuances.

Select & hit reply button.


I am surprised that none of the earlier long discussions on the topic
in the fosscom and ilugd mailing lists have been mentioned in this
discussion.

We can go for a PIL and there are many other ways of wrecking havoc on AICTE.

Linux did not grow by eating away windows share of market. It grew by 
eating Unix market share. If you have noticed there were reports in 
lwn.net that Linux is influencing the Upstream developers decision on new 
features and other important decisions. Can you quote any significant 
features that Unix provide which Linux doesn't. I tried freebsd and 
didn't like them a bit.

OP wrote a mess.

FYI Linux is a kernel.
Unix is a class term for many OSes. Unix philosophy is a set of
principles for OS design and use.
GNU is not Unix.
But GNU user land can be integrated with Linux or BSD or other kernels
There are many BSD distros.

         Good to know that :) AICTE, should have been a neutral body,
with no vendor association. But given that they have already partnered
with MS, we need to put up a united, joint effort. We aren't aware of
what the ilugd/fosscom members have planned for this. It would be good
if you could as well share the decision taken there. And as Bharathi
said, we need to get help from a lot of other organisations across
India.

Bhaskar, it is true that you have been migrating/already migrated a
lot of colleges in TN to using free software. But since this problem
is pan-India, I guess we need to make quite an effort to avoid
partnering en-mass with microsoft. Thanks

This has been around for a while and is useful as it automatically
does bottom posting. For interleaved posting, I either mark text and
interleave or hit the reply buton, click the hidden text three dot

A. You have booted into a live CD and now want to save some files you
created to your harddisk?  See if the harddrive is already mounted,
there should be a file explorer of some kind, if you can write to
that, it is done.

or, is it that

B. Live Server is some kind of Linux box you can ssh into, and you
want to copy files into a local windows box?  In that case, you can
use SCP, there are free tools for Windows to do that - WinSCP or pscp.

or, is it something else?

C. rephrase your question, so that someone can help you.

You want to write to a local Windows machine, from a Linux server?  I
don't know how.  But if you can ssh from Windows into this server, you
can initiate a copy (via pscp/WinSCP) from the Windows side.

Can you ping the Windows machine from the Linux side?  If so, maybe
somebody else can help you do specifically what you want.

Hello Everybody

I hope this is the correct forum for this discussion. If not please point
me to the correct ilist and ignore this email.

I have been doing some reading on legal issues in selling open source OS (
Fedora / Ubuntu ). However I still have some questions unanswered. I tried
contacting both Canonical and RedHat but did not get any response from them
. Below are some of my queries which hopefully I might be able to find
answers to on this ilist :

* Can I sell ubuntu/fedora as it is on my website. I would not directly be
selling the OS but only the services around it . However can I have the OS
uploaded on my website ? Also is it illegal to say that "Our company XYZ
provides support for Ubuntu/Fedora ?

* Can I use their logos on my website without Canonical/RedHat's consent ?

* In order to use Ubuntu/Fedora do I have to get rid of all the
Ubuntu/Fedora logos from the ISO and then upload it on the website ? (
There are lot of apps to create a ubuntu based distro however I was
wondering if there is one which can let us get rid of only the Logos/Splash
Screen. The ones we see during installation and during boot and all the
other that are there on the system ) .

* Any other trademark violation that I should be looking at ?

* Any more questions that I should be asking ?


Regards
Mayan

Do you have to necessarily push from Linux? Can't you pull from Windows?
It is unlikely that a typical Windows box is running sshd.
I suggest you install an ssh client on Windows and download the desired
file.

Best wishes,

Subject: [Ilugc] some more blurb on UNIX and Linux
Message-ID: <CALDskyx4Jc0PDg85SiDhDvHEKTBVnvuCR-gdXgSdYuGnjwUJUg@mail.gmail.com>

This is mostly academic meaning it is useless.

It is only for conversational purposes or to win an argument.

But rarely you will get a chance to apply this knowledge too.

So to repeat UNIX is not dead.

UNIX is not an OS. It is an idea, a philosophy, a way of thinking and
a bunch of implementations,
 toolsets, shell, kernel and so on.

Linux is different from UNIX but Linux is not a form of UNIX. It was
derived from UNIX.

Today also UNIX is live and kicking in several forms though it is not
popular amongst the
 LUG community because most people in LUG are beginners. People who only know
 popular software.

So UNIX is also used in several places both in the form of appliances,
network devices, NAS
 boxes and so on.

FreeBSD is a common derivative of UNIX.

In the case of Linux, there is the concept of a separate kernel, a
separate userland, GNU toolsets,
 distributions and so on.

RPM, Deb packages etc. are a strictly Linux thing.

In the case of UNIX there is no idea of a kernel being pluggable into
a userland.

If you say UNIX it means kernel,userland packaged together as the base
system. Usually
 this also has a mail server, web server, ftp server, make, gcc,sh,ksh
and so on.


Only in the case of Linux you can separate the kernel or OS drivers
and hardware management from the shell and
 rest of userland which is built with GNU tools.

And a distribution has the responsibility of putting these two
together to make a meaningful OS.

In the case of UNIX no such need exists.

A UNIX OS is completely usable.

Greetings fellow-Linuxers,

I have a vision to share with you.
Whether you call it a utopia, or a dystopia, I leave up to you.

There is great power in people's numbers.
I feel that a critical mass is gathering behind FOSS and BitCoin.
I feel that these Davids can potentially overthrow Goliaths.

What? I mean, what?? When you write something or say something, it is supposed to explain your views and thoughts. When a person reads the above 2 sentences, how are they supposed to interpret what you said? You are saying UNIX is an OS, and Linux is just a kernel.How can Linux be derived from Unix? 




>it is not popular amongst the LUG community because most people in LUG are beginners. People who only know popular software. 





You have successfully insulted many on this list, and yourself as well, with a single statement. Congratulations! Maybe you post here to get responses, rather than to enlighten.

ok, 'rectifying'.

The problem is small groups with vested interests in and outside AICTE
have too much power. They regard it as their private property.

Karthikeyan, thanks for your encouragement.

I imagine this scenario --

Rickshaw pullers accept BTC through their smartphones and avoid paying
taxes.

Smartphone running Linux, Bit Wallet's Open Source Clone, and NFC.
The revolution is waiting to happen.

Don't like your government? Don't yell. Stop paying them.
You can still make a living. There are others like you.
Learn the secret handshake, and change the world.

Hello All,

Thank you for your response. Here I concluded as

Windows based work station
wont be able to issue scp directly on the server is your windows computer
cant accept that type of command. We need to splitting the files into 2-3
separate tar files, which are only ~ 2-3GB in size then download them one
by one.

linux based workstation
We can use scp [options] username1 at source_host:directory1/filename1
username2 at destination_host:directory2/filename2

Don't like your government?

I like any uncorrupted government.

Rickshaw pullers and many big corporations hide a lot from taxes.

Question is, who pays taxes and keeps government alive? Is government a
convenient fiction that has run its course?
In my opinion, it will become possible for all aspects of human nature to
emerge, without government.
Is that possible, practical, desirable?
Unregulated free trade. Anything you can imagine.
The darkest things, and the best aspects of human nature, set free.
Corruption, purity, everything.
This is not realistic, of course. We already live in a police state, and
have no privacy.
How can the government possibly allow private P2P transactions?

If you have a http server running in your live Linux machine (apache or
friends), the simplest and quickest way if it is a one time requirement is:

   - Copy the zip/tgz to the htdocs folder (/var/www?)
   - Go to any browser in the windows machine and type in
   http://your-linux-machine-ip/yourbackupfile
   - After download, delete the backup from the public directory.

I think that this ongoing experimentation with bitcoins will serve as a
basis for creating
future currency, but in its current form, there is just too much bias
towards early adopters,
and hence no confidence in people who have been too late to the bitcoin
goldrush; and
this will be the downfall of bitcoin in current form.

It depends on the OS.  This would be the equivalent of mirroring free
or for a small charge e.g. selling DVDs of the ISO files.   The
community versions (to the best of my knowledge) can be distributed
w/o any approval.  This may not hold true for the commercial versions
from Redhat and Novell, they give eval versions with keys for trials.
 Each distro has some kind of distribution policy, you should read
that policy.

No but you cannot claim that you are some kind of partner with the
respective company unless you have a proper paper contract.

>

Wow,  these are trade marks.

Suppose you had a company with a logo upon which you have spend
time/money to build a brand name.  Would you like some un-associated
entity to use your logo?   Short answer NO.

Read the distribution policy of respective distro, there is no one
blanket answer that covers everything.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] How to fresh reinstall Android?
Message-ID: <CAN4GZGKzbqp8Jq_2f5zE6NESKsYzNx-X=RrMwtrstQdedctDOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Guys/Gals,

I have a Nexus S phone, It is terribly slow now. I want to backup all data
and re-install with latest possible android.

Since, this is a costly phone (for me atleast). I was paranoid about doing
it, and have been deferring the reinstall forever.
Now, I think it is time to do it.

I have googled quite a bit, but haven't found a satisfactory step by step
guide. Please provide me with links to step by step
installation guide that you've followed? or tell me the high level steps,
if you've done it before. Also, educate me about
any gotchas that I should be aware of.

Thanks,
-Sathish

Backup the data and do a factory reset instead of reinstall. See if this
fixes the problem.

Since yours is a Nexus device, the official images are available at.
There are instructions in the same page. Note that the latest version
officially supported by Google for Nexus S is 4.1.1. If you want to
install the latest and greatest Android version out there - 4.2.2 at
the time of writing, you can flash ROMs like Cyanogenmod, AOKP.

What ?? If you love Unix and not Linux, don't post such nonsense in Linux 
mailing list. Instead hang around in Unix mailing list like the BSDs. 
This is not the first time you are degrading linux users in linux mailing

Wonder why people are so afraid of true economic freedom? Yes it will bring
an unimaginable revolution, but I think humans are intelligent enough to
forge a new system that will work.

It'd be great if some of you could post comments highlighting the

at <http://defectivebydesign.org/no-drm-in-html5> (and share those
comments back with this list). The EFF article is a great one to link to
for explaining the problems.

<http://www.defectivebydesign.org/blog/1106> is another oldie but goodie
that helps explain why DRM is a problem even for streaming rather than
purchases. This is one of the main things we need to address -- that DRM
is no more okay for "streaming" services than it is for downloads that
you "own."

There is a case to be made for paying lip-service in public, to the best
aspects of human psyche, however hypocritically.
The hope is that one day, conscience awakens and tries to make the lies
true.

True economic freedom would allow for private islands of total darkness,
utterly devoid of any need for public morality.
A stable civilization might not be formed when darknets of dissidents trade
weapons and terrorize the common person.

If that happens, the currency used by them will be devalued automatically.
Just like that of North Koreas! Well of course they could use force and
violence to evaluate their money's value and acceptance just like United
States does it today. US$ would have far less value if it had a leaner
military.

Karthikeyan, I agree about the USD being propped up by the defense budget.

If a common un-regulated virtual currency takes hold, and anonymous
transactions become possible, would it matter if you were buying as
KinJongUn or GeorgeSoros?
Anyone from a darknet could buy from a clearnet, and vice versa. Loyalties
wouldn't matter. Public identity would erode. I don't think the currency
would devalue.

I am thinking that perhaps a pragmatic course would be to negotiate peace
within the framework of the government.

In this case the list a consists of a single tuple and so the way the loop
is organized it prints each element of the list-- in this case one tuple

> 1 2

Here instead of using a tuple you are unpacking a tuple. This code assumes
that the elements of the list are all 2 tuples and assigns the first
element to i and the second to j.

Same explanation as above.

Refer to the explanation to the first loop

Subject: [Ilugc] The different ways by which I move data
Message-ID: <CALDskyy99HXMsDsmHTn2DRCasja32uJsYxSwi0yF_cVJg6VkPg@mail.gmail.com>

Having had to upload a lot of data in the past 15 years or so, mostly
during the last 8 years I think I have
 learnt to adapt to poverty, poor bandwidth conditions, unstable links et al.

I have used a few of the advanced protocols in the UNIX world to move
data around.

I also download but I think I am more of an upload guy.

In fact my LiveCD and LiveUSB projects themselves contribute to nearly
4.8 GB of upload.

I have had physical machines that assist this process in the US and
now in the UK.

But it is not any high funda stuff. Just plain UNIX command line usage.

I thought it would make an interesting story for you.

I mostly use a combination of a transfer protocol like scp or ftp or
rsync and follow it up with a checksum check
 using sha1.

For really large files the checksumming itself will take minutes.

The average size of files I deal with are in the range of 600MB to 2 GB.

How do I manage to move them around?

Wherever rsync is available I use that. But it is a problem due to
using a non standard port, due to the need to
 have it at both ends, so I use scp, dd and some shell commands.

dd(1) has an ability to copy from an offset, either from input or output.

The issue happens when transfers get cut or interrupted.

To speed up transfers you could use a download accelerator. But we are
talking about uploads here.

So I never did that.

If you have multiple Internet links then you could use a better link
aggregation strategy. But I have not done
 such things yet.

Maybe now since I have two links here.

There are a few points to be noted about uploading data.

And upload may choke downloads in certain cases. So I normally leave
it running at night in an at(1) job.

And in a DSL case which is most common for us, upload speeds are 1/4th
of the download speed.

Mostly lesser than that.

But BSNL links I have used all my life have been very helpful for me.
Rock solid and stable.

Even the 256 kbps link at my parents' has been able to fetch me a
Debian ISO of 650 MB.

So when things go well I don't do any UNIX stuff.

But I think I downloaded the ISO using jigdo which itself has built in
magic for interrupted transfers.

For those of you who understood what I spoke just now and have done
these things yourself the
 specific commands would not be hard.

But just in case,

$ dd if=foo.iso skip=2000 bs=1024 of=rem.bin

will help.

Subject: [Ilugc] Does Open Source really matter for end user adoption and
	satisfaction?
Message-ID: <CAN4GZGLhoUbacQve6VOE=eW54=AugyOPOTuG+fTLc1p+VFsrNg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Guys/Gals,

I've been thinking about this topic for a while, I've been a follower
of open-source for years now, I advocate for open systems where ever
possible, that said, I have an opinion that I want to put out there
and get your thoughts and inputs on the same.

Software is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform
certain task or a set of functions. Weather the source code is
open-source or free software or proprietary doesn't matter to the
machine, since it is a machine it will perform any task given to it in
a right manner.

Recently open source methodology has exploded with many great projects
and hundreds of thousands of contributers across the world. It is
great for open-source ecosystem. Many developers/businesses has grown
to expect open source software for any business critical
infrastructure to avoid vendor lock-in. Open-source has been proven as
the best way to develop software.

My concern is, while open source is a great way to develop software. A
software being open-source doesn't add much incentive to end-user to
adopt or switch to the software. End user expectations are entirely
different. Any software vendor that takes this into account, comes up
with much better software. For Example, Internet Explorer had greatest
market share when Firefox entered the scene, But, Firefox gained a
significant market share because Mozilla was able to deliver a browser
with much superior quality and end user experience.

I believe when we deliver software with superior quality, beauty and
ease of use, it gives user incentives to try out/switch softwares and
we may not have to evangelize our softwares.

Following excerpt is from a KG's ILUGC Post

I offer to build applications for the client, charge what I feel is a
reasonable sum and convince them that

**if the software is open source
from the start it is easier to get people to contribute to it, the code
is available if I drop dead and it is easy for them to upgrade and debug
errors. My costs are cut because whenever I am stuck I can always find
people who are willing to write some code for free (although sometimes I
pay) because it is open source.**

there are different aspects in  what you said ,

1) market forces : market will decide on what will survive free or
proprietory
2) development methodology : open source the emphasis is  more on the
development methodology and packaging, Freedom is not emphasised much and
the advocates try to avoid the term. since the whole point of starting of
this was to not to confuse the word free with free beer.
3) philosphy : free software is a movement social/political one where the
free as in freedom is important.

most of what you hear the noise and fanaticism is about the third where
people needed to be educated .

Any useful pointers would be helpful.

Could you please expand on this requirement? For instance, the tree
command does something in-built:

tree -P '*deb' -H . > index.html

Should you have special requirements, please let me know and I'll see
if something is available.

In Fedora / CentOS / RedHat we can create individual static HTML pages for
each binary packages using 'repoview' as seen below.

http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/repoview/

These individual static HTML pages were usually created using the 'repodata'

http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/repodata/

I am looking for a similar one in Debian / Ubuntu (i.e. creating individual
static HTML page for each binary package)

Unfortunately, such a tool doesn't seem to exist, based on my
searching. One would have to hand-roll a script to read the deb
package's control file in order to come up with such a solution.

Should I run into something like this, I will let you know.

What about packages.debian.org? It looks very similar, though not an
exact match. http://packages.debian.org/about/ has more details.

Do not hijack threads. This thread is about a tool to generate static
html for packages in a Debian/Ubuntu repository. Start a new thread
for your question.

I was searching the internet for something matching your requirements
and came across this - http://debian.wgdd.de/debian/ . There is a
'parse-apt-files.inc' PHP script that was used to generate the list in
that page. With some customization, you might be able to get it to
work the way you want it to.

This is ok.  How about generating this information from a existing local
repository.

Any pointers would be helpful.

I tried that approach. The source for that is available, but,
unfortunately, it looks to be server side and not static HTML file
based.

try it out and post the feedback.

In our FOSS Lab server we create static HTML style pages using repoview for
RPM based distributions like Fedora / CentOS.  The college system
administrators browse through the repository groups / packages in browser
and later they install them through YUM package manager.

If a similar thing could be available for Debian / Ubuntu it would be
helpful to everyone.

First tip: Don't host in India. Not with your own resources.

Second tip: Nobody gets 100,000 visitors a day just like that.

Start with something small and then scale out or scale up.

It is not so easy to get that many hits. Even if you run p0rn on your site.

So this assumption is quite meaningless.

You must read the official python tutorial first. Their they explain
about the difference between,

1. A tuple (1,2)
2. A list [(1,2)]
3. A dictionary {"tuple": (1,2)}

I suggest please go through at least one python tutorial and learn the
differences between these three things. You will clearly understand how
those for-loops works.

You don't tell them you are using F/OSS.   In my proposals, I present
software that meets or exceeds the client's functional requirements.

I suggest clients to go for commercial licensed when their
requirements cannot be met with F/OSS.

Re your example of browser.    A bit of history - Mosaic (developed
with US tax payer funds) was the first browser to hit the mainstream
Internet users.  Netscape Navigator (Mark Andreesesn of Mosaic fame)
was the next browser [a].   IE became popular because of MS
distribution policy (see above ref.) ;   even today most people accept
it because it is the *default* browser that comes with the MS
Windows.   To many IE is synonymous to Net browsing as is Excel to
spreadsheet.  Most have not heard of visicalc nor Mosaic.

Much of the above is related to the developer's mind set.   There are
many instances of disastrous projects coming out of the "cathedral"
development model [b].

Acceptance is a mind set with the end user set as well.   In a few
instances, I have found it is well nigh impossible to change some
user's mind set about switching to a F/OSS product, irrespective of
it's high value.  Life is short -- it is best to leave such people to
their preferences and move on.

Subject: [Ilugc] some C ideas
Message-ID: <CALDskyx5=Vvn3m_H=4YoPYzbO0szGN6PvnznP1T6oKMkHFjG2w@mail.gmail.com>

C coding is fun but it is always an IQ test and a memory test.

It is not like python or perl or shell.

C requires a great deal of algorithmic thinking and takes plenty of
open source code walk throughs , browsing
 other people's code and obtaining guidance from existing C code
before we can do a good job.

With its power and flexibility one can do great things.

And it takes quite a bit of innate ability and interest to write good
quality C code.

If you take my entire life, my biz career, my products, the proportion
of C must be around 30%.

In my working career it was almost completely C though perl also
started playing a role.

But that was not much coding, mostly debugging, bug fixing and enhancements.

People unnecessarily confuse C++ with C.That is totally different.

C by itself is great fun and an ideal language for a small subset of
the common problems we face in technology.

But the small part is so critical to everything else that its
importance can never be underestimated.

For example the entire TCP/IP stack runs C, all UNIX and Linux kernels.

All languages, databases,shells are written in C.

But to do a good job of your task at hand you don't code in C.

You choose a higher level language like ksh or perl or python.

C is useful for dong sockets programming though they can also be
achieved using other languages.

Some socket semantics and flags may not be there in higher level
languages but if you avoid C,
 then you also avoid buffer overflow problems, string
manipulation/pointer bugs, even concurrency issues.

C is good for daemons and server processes.

But you can save time and effort by farming out the key
business/technology logic to some other
 language and invoke it using execve() or something.

I have never done it but it is possible. I normally call shell tools
using system(2) and not exec.

The performance that C can give nothing else can.

To write a really good quality C program it takes just 10 years. (Not
including college)

Rather quick.

Subject: [Ilugc] Suggest a workflow for few developers working on same
 codebase managed by Git
Message-ID: <CAN4GZGL768yUTQ1c8tCEX9eJV1qBkBS848kTExiqrR-=5XgONQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Guys/Gals,

I'm working on a Ruby on Rails project which is hosted as a Git
project under Bitbucket. The other developer who is working on the
project has forked the repository and sends pull requests from his
master branch to my master branch, when I comment on necessary
corrections, he creates new commits. Now when I go ahead and merge the
pull-request, the history has bugfix commits which are not necessary.

Please suggest a workflow that suits 2 to 3 people group, who are in
close communication, keep a clean topic branch and still get the work
done.

Thanks,
Sathish

You can do either do a "git merge --squash" or a "git rebase -i" and set one 
specific commit as the 'main' commit to 'pick' and set all the rest to 'squash'. 
These commands squash multiple commits into one.

Hmm, I would recommend reading through the different approaches mentioned here:
http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-3.html#Integrating-Contributed-Work

and choose one that fits your needs (or try out each of them for a short period 
and see which works best).

IMHO, I suggest using the 'git-flow' workflow:
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

In fact, there is a tool named git-flow, that lets you do this without having to 
think about it:

Even with C Object Oriented code can be written even though C does not
provide the language constructs to do that. Many open source projects
have a such code (some are GObject based while some are not). There
are lots of OO code written in Linux kernel (kobject used in device
drivers - inheritance, abstraction of device details etc are
examples). Learning / Implementing OO in that way will let people know
how things work actually. C++ provides language constructs (or
keywords) for OO and it makes things easier but internally it is the
same as implementing OO using C. I have written OO code using C and
when I learned C++ actually I did not put any effort - just read what
keywords to use in which place and done.

I expected better vetting of content by the EFY editors, given that it

ehe, what is the date for this article and who is the author ? Seems like this 
itself is a copy/paste or rather a rehash of better articles posted on HN a 
while ago:

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5508225
http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1bv359/dont_copypaste_from_website_to_terminal_demo/

While the actual concern is valid, it is along the common sense line of thinking 
about what you are doing, similar as "Don't click on links from emails that do 
come from a trusted source" Or "Always check the URL if you are being redirected 
to a login page".

Here is an in-depth look at the issue (linked from the HN article submission 
mentioned above):

Have you tried reading about android at all? Because if you did, pretty
certain you would know the answer to this.

Nokia primarily runs windows now. Symbian is more or less dead. This is the
case for more than a year.

Why? To do what?

Reading the manuals/howto's would probably be a popular method. Or
experimenting with building apps for each OS?

They already have. Why would they not?

or Andriod will occupy the Number one market ?  or

Does it matter?

Everyone, including you has the potential/"chances" to introduce
revolutionary ideas.

Message-ID: <CADOy0YpfNk+tt7BGy-8sZor=iP68OBixco3M2Tpg7U4c_CUDJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
   My question is very silly but i dont know how to handle it.
when i do some changes from a CMS say it is Wordpress its not reflecting
the changes on the file. like its not writing the config file and when i
change the permalinks its not writing the .htaccess file. i know the
reason because it doesnt have root access. when i do it through the
terminal i m able to do it since i get the access to root before i do the
operation. what is the the solution for this how can i get rid of this
issue?

P.S. i use ubuntu

thanks with regards
Abdur Rahman

Make sure the Apache user has access to the WordPress folder. You can
do that by chown-ing the folder to www-data user

chown -cR www-data wordpress

Engineering students locked into Microsoft Office

Come June 30, over 80 lakh college students all over India would have little
choice but to use Microsoft Office 365 in their college computers, locked by
a government contract that may well be more expensive than the use of an
open source equivalent in the long run.

The decision by the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) will
limit engineering students to a particular product at a time when their
exposure should be widened, say experts. It also forces college
administrations to adopt one technology instead of giving them the
flexibility to install whatever suits their students? needs best, they said.

Efforts to contact Microsoft were unsuccessful until Sunday night.

In open source, the core of the technology is available without charge as
free download. Open source requires no initial investment, with many vendors
offering support and maintenance at half the price charged by proprietary
software vendors.

The AICTE, which serves more than 11,500 technical colleges and institutes
across the country, had awarded Microsoft a contract last year that let the
AICTE implement the company?s cloud email and storage offering, which
centralizes email storage and provides for a simpler and potentially less
expensive solution.

A recent notification by the AICTE states that all institutes must
compulsorily install and use Microsoft Office 365, a productivity suite,
which has little to do with the functioning of the cloud-storage service.

There is no free, open-source cloud-based offering, and Microsoft?s product,
priced at zero initial cost, fulfills that need. Dr. S.S. Mantha, Chairman,
AICTE, announced, ?Office 365 will enhance our day to day communication,
collaboration, and monitoring of the colleges we oversee... This will help
us promote and propagate innovation across all 11,500 institutions.?

The AICTE notification that announced the mandate says the project needs to
be completed by June 30, 2013.

Open-source software such as Linux has become popular among college students
in recent times as its zero-cost approach promotes inclusivity, with former
President Abdul Kalam stating ?In India, open source software will have to
come and stay in a big way, for the benefit of our billion people.?

Addressing what he called a popular misconception about the availability of
support for open-source installations, Raghavendra Selvan, an assistant
professor at an engineering college in Bangalore, clarified, ?Once you have
installed such a product, there are companies that will charge you just for
maintenance and support.? Red Hat is an example of a large enterprise that
caters to just this need.

If the government would consider an open-source alternative, it wouldn?t be
the first time. In early 2011, the state government of Kerala deployed an
open-source enterprise-resource planning (ERP) package named Fedena to
assist over 15,000 schools and 70 lakh students.

Mr. Selvan suggested the government could use the Fedena model, and added,
?The office suite is not necessary. Using Office 365 would only limit
students to Microsoft's perspective and stand in the way of serious
open-source research in rural colleges,? he added.

In his book Outliers (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)>)
Malcolm Gladwell proposed the 10,000 hour rule "claiming that the key
to success in any field is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing
a specific task for a total of around 10,000 hours."

However, to aspire to be an expert one needs to take the first step
towards that goal. So, it takes the first step towards contributing to
an open source project and participating in an open source community
to be set towards becoming an expert.

Now, Gladwell may have been correct or, totally wrong. However, Karl
Fogel has a reasonably interesting book
<http://producingoss.com/en/index.html> which lays out things to get
familiar with should one try to begin to contribute to open source
software. A beginner should pick a project/tool/application/service
(s)he loves and, if the selection has an open source community, get
involved by asking smart questions about where one can begin to
contribute.

Hi ILUGC!

I've gat a new client, who is opening a new hotel soon. I explained him
about the concept, development model and the benefits of using a FOSS based
solution. He was impressed and wants to implement a FOSS based Hotel
Management Solution.

He also has had a bad experience in vendor lock-in. He wants a
client-server based model, that'll take care of billing, employee salaries
and stock taking. On googling, I found out that there are many Hotel
Booking Software that are available. But I couldn't find any software that
would fit his needs. So please let me know if there are any FOSS software
that would fill this need.

can you give a list of what you found ? , one approach could be find the
one closest to his requirement and work with the community to satisfy the
customer needs , or if you think that is too much of re engineering start
one from scratch . there are pros and cons and both the approaches .

Nice advocacy :)

I would suggest avoid 'client/server' apps., it is legacy.   I have
seen MS Windows based apps and they too have moved to Web UI based
solutions in the Hospitality vertical.   Your customer can install
thin clients and  the staff can access the application from any
browser (needless to mention with proper ACL).

I second Satyakam's comment.

ALL solutions, however comprehensive they might be, will require customization.

The nice thing with a F/OS/S solution - you have access to the code to
mod. it to your customer's specific requirements.

You know best what your customer wants.   In selecting a solution,
besides customer requirements,  you need to consider (a) the platform
(b) your competence level in that platform for customizing the
application.

Do let us know how the project goes.

Best.

I am also facing a similar situation, please do let me know if there is any
FOSS software,
Moreover, since I need this software at multiple stores, I have to spend a
lot on license for each site.

My needs are inventory management, add details about all SKUs, all options
for Point of Sales (PoS)
I would also like to hear from any developer who is already working on
similar project, if any.

Dear All,

             You would never get a FOSS software exactly meeting your need.
You will have to 'tailor' it to your needs. Hire some developers or rather
ask some freelancers or hobbyists to customize it.it is still much cheaper
than any  Commercial software.

Saket Sinha

Glad to hear that you use ubuntu more than windows . Its a bit strange
that ubuntu performance has decreased .  What are the new packages you
installed ? Especially propreitary applications or drivers ? Any idea
of the applications which potentially are running on background . Also
did you run any updates ?
> Is there is any way to improve my system performance.
First you need to find out who the culprit is . Try system monitor and
see what applications are running .
Also you can try a small utility(need to install) called "iotop" which
gives a list of IO processes running and the top ones come there .

Boot time also depends on the services which start during boot up ,
especially the network and potentially disk check which might be
taking some time . Check if they are running .

Regards,
Pavithran

Please avoid using SMS abbreviations and compose complete sentences.

It is hard to understand what you are trying to say (at least to me).
I tried  Google translate; it was not of much help.

What level of comparison you are looking at?
Content only or even formatting and fonts?

ok the way to do it is use a ms word to txt converter and then use diff

Works very well.

rtftotext or something.

Although, I personally do not attach much value to certification; it

(a) "Focus on the fundamentals and learn the concepts well."   Too
often the focus is on the 'step by step' solution without much
understanding of the what, why, how.

(b) "Application of Mind"  (AoM) - learn how to apply the fundamentals
(you already know) to solve problems.   Experiment your ideas and see
what comes out of them.

(c) Make *new* mistakes.   Learn from your own and other's mistakes
and do *not* repeat them. This can only happen when you experiment a
lot and participate in many forums especially global (also mailing
lists, blogs etc.). Do not be afraid of making mistakes or be afraid
of failure.  Develop a thick skin and not be afraid to ask your own
questions.

(d) Keep updating your skill set with the latest trends.

(e) Be humble - however much we know - it is not even a spec in the
larger scheme of things.

(f) Be patient - it does not happen in a matter of weeks or even months.

doc files have tons of meta data like author, date and times. A
direct comparison using tools like diff will almost always fail. Since you
have mentioned in the other message that you only want to compare text
content and not formatting, you could possibly use the following method...

Install LibreOffice and run the following command to convert the doc file
to plain text:
libreoffice --headless --invisible --convert-to txt:Text filetoconvert.doc

After this, you will have all the text in a file called filetoconvert.txt
Run the stream editor `sed` to remove all blank lines:
sed '/^$/d' filetoconvert.txt > convertedandstripped.txt

Now you can run `diff` to find simple differences. If you want to compare
in a more intelligent fashion, open the text file using your favorite
programming language and write the logic :)

If you are going to call LibreOffice from within your shell script or php
script or any other app, use the following command. I struggled to make it
work and took hours of internet searching!

export HOME=/tmp && libreoffice --headless --invisible --convert-to
txt:Text filetoconvert.doc

LibreOffice requires a valid home directory.

All the best.

Dear Linux-ers,

I have the rare privilege of getting the attention of someone who
frames technology policy for India. I have been asked to prepare a
document in 1000 ASCII characters or less, that makes the case for
Linux. My contact is highly educated, yet not very technical.
Here is the document I wrote. In Open-Source-style, I am opening it up
to the public, before I submit it to the powers-that-be.
Please, help me improve it!

Thanks,

- Ashwin.

#########BEGIN

Open-Source Software ( Linux ) is peer reviewed by the public, and is
generally considered more secure than Closed-Source Software ( Windows
), which is reviewed by the company that made it. Windows has gained a
stronghold since Linux became comparably user-friendly much later.
Linux is free to download and use indefinitely.

China is realizing benefits by adapting to this changing technology
landscape, and standardizing on Linux. This gives China a significant
advantage in security, and education, and goes a long way towards
ending their financial dependence on foreign software.

Our government is driven on vehicles whose engines can only be fixed
by paid foreign mechanics. Our cars should be opened to Indian
mechanics.

Microsoft Office, and Windows are opaque to our students. Chinese
students will gain an edge on us by using Linux, an operating system
whose source they can freely study, improve, and share.

Open-Source Software in government and education is recommended.

"doc" is a representation format for data. For diff, you need to
compare text (data).

Use markdown to write your documents, and store them in plain text
files. Diff can be applied on these. You can also convert them to any
format using tools like Pandoc [1].

Data and presentation need to be separate.

The way you're thinking is a dangerous approach. Please go and understand
the Unix permission model else you'll frequently run into trouble.
What you need to do is give read and write access to the wordpress files
and directory. Apache on your server must be running as a some user,
usually apache, www-data, nobody. Give read and write access for that user
to the wordpress files.

	embedded linux
Message-ID: <CANpPA8+K_+G+xEbFMwwHM7J7ZP4OdZiN4rUM_REkTP=dGwnQhQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

We created an embedded Linux system using build root tool.
We integrate wine as we have to load our windows application
from the linux system.

We wrote a shell script to initially boot from the bootable CD
and then copy the contents of the CD into the harddisk,
and then unmount the CD and eject it and reboot the system.
Now onwards it should boot from hard disk and load the application so that
user can use it.

We used grub command but for some reason we get the following error and it
does not boot from the hard disk.

Running "intall /boot/grub/stage1 (hd0)
(hd0) 1+18 p (hd0,0)/boot/grub/stage2
/boot/grub/menu.lst"....failed
Error 6:Mismatched or corrupt version of stage1/stage2.

We would like to know if we have missed out some packages in buildroot
compilation or is there a problem in the shell script,
I have attached the shell script for your reference

How to solve this error?

OK, so now you have a fully functional system on a hard disk that boots, right?

If yes, then you should create an "image" of this 'pristine'
installation with dd into a file and on the other end dd this file on
to a hard disk and you should be done!

The shell script could be improved with the contents of the menu.lst
as a "Here Document" or simply copy a template from the CD.  Too many
echos IMO to create a file :(

It is not sufficient to copy the Grub files /boot/grub/*.  Grub
installs it own boot loader in the disk's MBR.

You also need to dd the Grub's MBR to the boot sector of the new disk.
 I did not see it in your script (unless I am missing something).

See above.

Alternately, you can switch to the 'extlinux'  boot loader; much
smaller foot print and less complicated.

usually, boot loader should be installed in the boot sector of the hard disk.
not in a partition.

Dont install in a root partition.

try installing in the hard disk itself.

sudo grub-install /dev/sda

This will detect the existing OS in all the partitions and setup the boot menu.

Try this and share the results.

No special settings in the UI is needed.

Just use the HTML input box.

Use any tamil keyboard input methods like ibus or copy paste any tamil
content there.

Make sure that your backend database is in utf-8 format.

Hi ChennaiPythonists,
Today 27/04/2013 at 3:00 PM Python April meet was began.
Around some 15 people attended.

== Talks

=== Telite GSM/GPRS modem with Python Engine

Venkat started the meet with an intresting topic.
He explained about a python engine runs in an Telite
GSM/GPRS Module.
He explained the following

  1. Python script intrepreter engine 1.5.2
in a 1 MB Non volatile  Memory space for scripting.
It has 1MB of RAM.
  2. He explained the folowing using MDM library.
       * Sending SMS
       * Sending MAIL
       * Calling a Phone no
  3. He showed a demo of flashing the code in the module
  4. He used some commands to execute the script inside th
     module.

Reference:
  http://www.telit.com/en/products/gsm-gprs.php?p_id=12&p_ac=show&p=47

=== Python Recipies


Vijay took an excellent session on Python Recipes
for writing switch case and enum in python.

He first explained switch case with a global variable
. But Switch implemented using Global variable
will corrupt the global variable if we are using
nested switch.So he replaced it with by creating instances.
Then he explained *args for checking multiple cases in
each switch case.

Then he took how to create enum

 1. enum(STATE, ["KING","QUEEN","PAWN"])
 2. He explained about type function to create instances

>>> test=type("STATE",(object,),{'king':0,'QUEEN':1,'PAWN':2})
>>> test
<class '__main__.STATE'>
>>> test.QUEEN
1
>>>

Then he took about __slot__ in order to
to avoid modifying Values in runtime.
While explaining enum he also explians
 some basics of creating objects.

== Rap up

Vijay asked audience who are all willing for next month talk.
Balamurugan and Rengaraj raised their hands for giving talk in
Next month.

Thanks to Zilogic Systems for offering  Cool Drinks in between the session

With that we wind up this month ChennaiPy meet.

Regards
Rengaraj

	Film
Message-ID: <CAND2796ydgRVTwexgsytSCt_r80kdFD0L19dpOhxoj2wpuiGnw@mail.gmail.com>

Dimensions is a French project that makes educational movies about
mathematics, focusing on spatial geometry. It uses POV-Ray to render
some of the animations, and the films are released under a Creative
Commons licence.

The fourth chapter, showing the stereographic projection of a
polychoron on our three-dimensional space.

The film is separated in nine chapters, which follow this plot:

    Chapter 1: Dimension two explains Earth's coordinate system, and
introduces the stereographic projection.
    Chapter 2: Dimension three discusses how two-dimensional beings
would imagine three-dimensional objects.
    Chapters 3 and 4: The fourth dimension talk about four-dimensional
polytopes (polychora), projecting the regular ones stereographically
on the three-dimensional space.
    Chapters 5 and 6: Complex numbers are about the square root of
negative numbers, transformations, and fractals.
    Chapters 7 and 8: Fibration show what a fibration is. Complex
numbers are used again, and there are circles and tori rotating and
being transformed.
    Chapter 9: Proof emphasizes the importance of proofs in
mathematics, and proves the circle-conservationess of the
stereographic projection as an example.

Download it at http://www.dimensions-math.org/Dim_download_E.htm and
share to all.

Hi,

We are having an IRC meeting on Monday 29 April at 9pm IST to discuss
how we can promote FOSS among women in India. We will be meeting at
channel #wfs-india at irc.freenode.net

This is a first meeting among people who feel the need to have a
community for women in FOSS in India to help each other, connect with
each other and address common issues faced by us.
Although, no strict agenda has been fixed, a few topics which might be
raised at the meeting are -

 - why and if at all do we need a group to promote FOSS among women in India
 - how we can improve networking among women in software in India
 - how we can unite to address common issues faced by women in
technology in India
 - how we can help each other to build skills, expertise and grow
professionally and personally
 - if we can organize an event (something on the line of adacamp - (I
really love the idea)) in India.
 - anything that you wish to bring up to help the cause.

Please join in if you are interested.

Regards,
Satabdi

To: network at lists.fosscom.in


Sometime ago, Canara Bank has introduced a desktop application to make
its NetBanking[0] *look* more secure ( earlier they only allowed
password, with no special characters). It is mandatory to use NetBanking
through this app or you can't use it. The main issue is the installer of
this app is only available for MS Windows and Mac OSes.. As can be seen
in the image in link[1]

So as a GNU/Linux user, I felt ignored, as to why and how they can do
this to us, and we must raise our voice, to make them know we exist, as
these kinds of things are done often by many other Gov. deptts. ( when
they Only IE)

I gave the concerns below to the Senior Branch Manager as well as mailed
(copy of letter below) to their concerned deptt. While the former
replied with "that the issues
are too technical and you are the only one having this issue", so it
would be better to talk to the CanSecure Team directly, which didn't
even reply till date.

I tried to to let them know the issues and solution I thought can work,
with the help of the letter below.

I am writing this to this list to discuss how to tackle such issues, so
that *we are heard*, and not *ignored* by these organizations.

Is there a policy on usage of FOSS in PSUs?

Ref. A/c no. ..................

I contacted the CanSecure customer care to allow me to use NetBanking
without CanSecure for my NetBanking A/c but your executive told that
CanSecure is mandatory for NetBanking.


So I am unable to use my NetBanking a/c because it requires CanSecure
which I am not able to use because for the following reasons:

* The installer is only available for Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac
operating systems which are both proprietary and it would roughly cost
me at least Rs. 5000 - Rs. 10000 to buy a legitimate copy of these OSes,
which is certainly not the way it should be, since NetBanking is very
basic service, and should be made easily accessible.

* I am using a better and open operating system known as GNU/Linux[1]
which is used by a lot of people, as it is freely available, and more
secure than the other two proprietary OSes, which is a must because bad
Operating Systems like Windows or Mac can't be trusted with such
confidential data, as they also contain malicious features such as
hidden spyware or malware. see the link[2] to know why Microsoft Windows
is not secure and link [3] to know about MacOS's malicious features.

* Moreover the application CanSecure is NOT Open source, which is
another reason that I can't trust it with such confidential data, used
exchanged in the case of NetBanking Application.


Solutions:
---------

*Either Allow make it optional, so that I can use NetBanking without
CanSecure


                                OR

* Make the CanSecure Application Open Source[4], so that one can check
or get the code checked for any malicious features, in that application.

                                AND

* Make an installer available for GNU/Linux as well so that other
customers like me, can also use the NetBanking service in a secure and
better environment.

                                OR ELSE

                I HAVE TO CLOSE MY ACCOUNT WITH YOU


I hope you will see to it that my concerns are given a thought or at`
least I expect a reply at the earliest.

-----------------------End of Letter--------------------------

PS: Well, I will be soon closing my A/c with this bank, just as a way to
protest against this. ( May be *1* customer less, doesn't affect them
much, but then if more people agree to such concerns and opt out then
they will have to listen to us)

While the letter from the AICTE chairman quotes
http://www.aicte-india.org/downloads/Commercial%20Software.pdf to show
that AICTE doesn't limit any institutions from using open source
software, there is still this document on the AICTE site
http://www.aicte-india.org/downloads/AICTE_notice.pdf that says that
this Microsoft Office 365 is mandatory for all institutions. In fact
this is the link being shared with the colleges asking them to do the
necessary to complete the migration.

P.S. Please follow the mailing list guidelines and do not top post.
Interleaved, trimmed posting is the recommended style.

why there is sword and a needle , why when you have a hammer everything
looks like a nail , why everyone should go to office , why should you work
, why you should get educated , why god created us :-)
well its all the same the purpose of everyone is different in the same way
there is someone who felt the necessity of distributions to solve certain
problem .

if you do not like any one of them you are free to create one . More choice
its better for the community , the control of the power will be distributed
will thwart monopoly .

as a beginner play with as many as you can and try to find the major
differences once you cross that hump you will be able to appreciate the
ecosystem more . Ultimately people do settle with some Distro after some
time so will you too.

Thanks for the link. Citing from the link:

<quote>
AICTE does not limit any institute from use of open source
applications or open standards and, in fact, the link
http://www.aicte-india.org/downloads/Commercial%20Software.pdf on its
site informs all its stakeholders the opportunities available in an
open environment.

I think, responsible people from individual colleges should get in touch
with AICTE citing Mr.S S Mantha's statement and get this clarified.

There is no such thing that fits everyone. Most of the Linux have some
target audience but still you can use any software in any distribution
as you wish. So basically things are same if you put little effort but
what varies is what things come by default. Maybe some distribution
provide easier method to do certain things easily based on their
target audience.

> slackware / Mint

I started with Fedora, used Fedora, Vector Linux, PC Linux OS, Mint,
Ubuntu and settled with Ubuntu. Until a year or so I had multiple
(about 3) Linux distribution installed in same machine.

There is only one world why need many kind of creatures (humans, cat,
dog, etc etc)? They have a purpose. One is good (better) at something
while another one is good at another thing.

There is sugar why people need different sweet varieties? This and the
above question are similar.

Hope this helps,

Hi,

Just as a clarification -- Linux is a kernel, the software that boots a 
computer, serves as an interface between the hardware and the software and 
manages resources like memory, cpu etc. There *is* just one upstream linux, the 
one that Linus Trovalds maintains at kernel.org.

The names that you mentioned (Red Hat / Fedora / ...etc) are known as Linux 
distributions. What these 'vendors' do is, take the linux kernel, customize it 
in some way if necessary, bundle it with different packages of different 
versions that they think addresses the needs of their target audience and 
release the whole thing as a 'distribution'. An interesting way to point out the 
difference is - Android, which is also a Linux distribution in a sense because, 
it runs on top of a (modified) linux kernel and the 'packages' on top of it come 
from google and other 'vendors' -- this android distribution is primarily meant 
for mobile/specific purpose devices. Now a lot of vendors (eg: Samsung, 
Motorola, LG, Sony ..etc) further customize android to suit their own devices.

So, now to answer your questions:

There is just one Linux kernel. There are plenty of linux distributions.

Each of these are created with a purpose in mind and target a specific audience.

That's a very subjective question. However, most linux distributions can trace 
their ancestry to either a rpm based distro or a deb based distro, so in those 
terms, the best bets to get introduced to a linux environment and be confident 
that the skills would be translatable to a large number of distributions, would 
be either Fedora or Debian.

This is very typical of a Bazaar Vs Cathedral model[1]. The question itself is 
meaningless because due to the nature of open source software, which 
/encourages/ people to 'build your own' implies that a single vendor will never 
possible nor even ideal.
