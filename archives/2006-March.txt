Your setup looks too complicated.  If you don't keep it simple, disaster
recovery will become a nightmare and _you_will_lose_data_.  I strongly
recommend that you change your setup.

There are two fundamental problems in your setup:
    1.  Too complex - mixing LVM and RAID.  Ask yourself if you
          really need these features, and trade it off for simplicity.
    2.  OS and data are not on separate HDDs.

Here is what I recommend:

    1.  Use a separate "system" disk (40-80GB IDE HDD) on which you load
         the entire OS.  I don't recommend soft RAID on your system disk.
         Ensure your computer has an CDROM (/dev/hdd).

    2.  For "data", use SATA and only RAID1 and RAID10.  Don't run RAID5.
            Eg. RAID1 (sda1, sdb1) = md0
                   RAID1 (sdc1, sdd1) = md1
                   RAID0 (md0, md1) = md2    (mount as /data/<hostmame>)

     3.  Forget LVM.  Soft RAID and LVM is too ugly.  Partition you disks
          correctly.

     4.  Ensure your HDDs have adequate airflow and are run cool.  If
           possible, invest in SATA enclosures
http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1599963&CatId=285

Here is a sensible partitioning scheme to use:
System disk:
hda1  -  /rescue  -  1GB  (mini OS install for "rescue mode" only)
hda2  -  root       -  250MB
hda3  -  /usr       -  5GB
hda5  -  /var       -  2GB
hda6  -  /tmp      - 1.5GB
hda7  -  /data/local  - <rest-of-disk>
hda8  - swap      - 512MB (ideally your system will not touch swap)

First, install a minimal version of your OS in hda1.  You will boot from this
only if the system disk itself fails or hda2-8 become corrupt.

Reinstall the OS as usual in hda2-8.

Use backuppc (or other) backup software to secure your system disk.

Data disk:
Single partition that fills almost the entire disk.  Mount under
/data/<hostname>.

It's very important that you do not partition the entire disk.  In your 300GB
disks, partition only upto ~299GB and leave the final 1GB empty.  Reason
is that a Seagate 300GB HDD is not the same size as a Maxtor 300GB HDD
and is bad for mirroring where both disks are expected to be the same size.

I run close to 20 servers like this and am very happy with the results.

Hope this helps.

How are your routing tables setup on both sides?

_Every_ machine on your network needs one of the below routes.

On the WiLAN end, you need 192.168.11.1 as router for 192.168.200.x.
On the LAN end, you need 192.168.200.68 as router for 192.168.11.x.

Perhaps it's cleaner to use the same 192.168.200.x subnet for the
WiLAN as well?  Or maybe make the WiLAN AP as the default gateway
for both subnets.

OK.
I  have boon going thro a lot of material for the last one week on related
matters.
The following are my understanding:

As the GNU/Linux is a community program, it is not very surprising to see a
bit of frictions here and there amongst the people contributing to the
progress. With the experience of being the cordinator for some community
programs, ( not s/w - national polio eradication),  i feel the best way to
look at (and deal with the situation) is to understand the different
interest groups with clarity.

Clash of interest is the most common problem in community programs since
most of the people contribute to the program just on/for  their interests
and not for commercial benefits.

The other common problem is clash of Ego.

In both the cases , some one in the group need to volunteer and  just grease
the area of heat and cool it down or just massage the egos that are clash if
needed. The key point to note is that  perfection in achieving the common
goal is the interest of the both the groups.

Here i would like to also point out that the Micro_oft interest group is not
seen in much action all thro, which i don't believe. Can not rule out the
possibility that, for a few ( or even many ) of the hearted ares in the
 GNU/Linux's development, the reason could have been an unidentifiable
instigation from the MS interest groups. For two reason

1. They are not small
2. They have huge business at stake.

Yes, its fine if all you are doing is GPL development; but companies like
to sell products because it pays salaries.

Not that GPLed products cannot be sold, it is just that there aren't too
many commercially successful purely GPLed products around. Please don't
say Linux, because companies don't really make money on Linux - companies
make some money on support, and the rest of the money is made on the
commercial products bundled along with Linux distributions - example RHEL,
Novell Enterprise Server etc which are all expensive because they bundle
commercial/proprietary products.

Again, its fine for you. But I am not taking about you. I am talking about
companies who make products which sell. Here, I must add a correction to
what I stated earlier - it is possible to transfer commercial QT licenses
between developers but only once every 6 months. That is, if you have a
developer who is working on QT and he leaves the company, you cannot use
the same license for another developer without waiting for a further 6
months.

Please note that I am not claiming that Trolltech should give away their
code. I am perfectly fine with paying for software and I regularly
purchase some pretty expensive software. What I am refering to is the fact
that Trolltech charges too much and that their licensing schemes (such as
the developer specific licensing) is just very difficult to work with.

Do you realize that many companies have GPL and non-GPLed editions of the
same software where the non-GPLed editions include some propreitary
extensions? Also, do you know that these companies sell the non-GPLed
editions? The commercial QT license explicitly forbids this. That is, once
a line of code is written using the QT GPL license, it can never be sold
by the same company which developed it even if the company purchases
commercial QT license.

Also, it may interest some to know that even the LGPL licensing of
libraries poses a legal problem on resource constrained embedded hardware
because the constraints imposed by the hardware do not make it feasible to
dynamically link to a library - that is, on these memory and processing
power constrained hardware which may not even include a dynamic library
loader, it becomes impossible to use a LGPL licensed library because the
LGPL license allows the use of these libraries with propreitary products
only if the library is linked to dynamically. That is, static linking to
these libraries are not allowed for propreitary software. If a software
links staticly to a LGPL software, then that software must also be
released under LGPL.

A lot of embedded solutions use LGPL licensed libraries in anycase, and
many link the propreitary software staticly with the LGPLed Libraries and
are actually violating the LGPL. Examples include many gaming consoles
which use LGPLed compression libraries for texture handling, glib routines
for stuff such as unicode and utf8 handling etc. I am not quoting any
names, but I am sure a few gaming consoles, PVRs etc come to mind
immediately.

How are your routing tables setup on both sides?

_Every_ machine on your network needs one of the below routes.

On the WiLAN end, you need 192.168.11.1 as router for 192.168.200.x.
On the LAN end, you need 192.168.200.68 as router for 192.168.11.x.

Perhaps it's cleaner to use the same 192.168.200.x subnet for the
WiLAN as well?  Or maybe make the WiLAN AP as the default gateway
for both subnets.

I'm looking at implementing Q.921/Q.931 stacks in software for Motorola ISDN
transceivers and a PPC host connected over TDM interface. Am looking at
ISDN4linux and m-isdn. Would like advise from those who have been there on
what I need to watch out for. Have not yet done a deep dive on the two
stacks.

Specifically would like to know if there is any specific hardware
dependencies embedded in these stacks that would preclude me from doing
this.

Fine. There's nothing wrong in looking for another license then. But there's a 
difference between bundling programs and trying to change a program from 
being GPL to being non-GPL.

OK, the specific terms of the non-GPL license are not exactly friendly. I 
don't dispute that.

Why should this dissuade me from using Qt for my GPL code?

That's a restriction of the GPL, not of the QTL, I think. The whole reason for 
the GPL is that nobody can close the source once it's been released under the 
GPL. The Qt license merely reaffirms this, I think. I don't think there's any 
excuse for releasing something under the GPL and then saying "I want to close 
it now". If you want it to be closed, do so from the beginning, or use 
something like the BSDL. I think BSDL (the new version, anyway) is GPL 
compatible, and that you can use the Qt opensource edition to write code in 
the BSDL. I don't know what happens after that, when you try to close the 
BSDL code, with respect to Qt, though.

Certainly. I know about this issue. The LGPL is there to allow dynamic 
linking...

In any case, I will personally continue to use Qt-opensource for my GPLed 
development, because I have no intention of ever closing it. If I ever need 
to develop closed-source Qt programs, that can come later.

Also, from the Qt site:

To transfer a license, *or if you need a more flexible licensing agreement*, 
please contact sales@trolltech.com. (emphasis mine)

I think they have a provision for negotiating a different license. I've got no 
idea how difficult using this would be, though.

Correct me if I am wrong..We cant code in glade directly, right. It is
only for designing the gui stuff. The actual GUI coding must be done
separately

There are many solutions:

1. set and export CC before proceeding:

 export CC=/path/to/gcc

2. Add the location where your gcc is installed to
PATH environment variable:

  PATH=$PATH:/path/to/

Actually I did it by opening ANJUTA IDE. Just i created new project then 
go to the project--> Edit Application GUI.
It will automatically open the glade. Then i created GUI. Save it . And 
build . Anjuta will automatically generate code
for glade. So there is no problem. I can add signal to particular widget 
also.
My problem is that ..
How to generate tree structure(like any file manager)? Which will 
automatically create row according to the directory structure.
I was able to create manually raw,put data,expand.... But to automatically,
So i am looking for that type of example code where i can idea(as i am 
not expart. I started GTK+ just three days ago).
I got several gtk+ based file manager code. But it is so big i could not 
able to understand properly.
So if someone has done,or if someone can give me some clue it would be 
better for me to do that..
thanks advance..

Doh!  The routes are not to be setup on PC2!!  You need to set it on the other
machines in your LAN so they can route packets through PC2.

Try pinging 192.168.11.11 from the 192.168.200.x subnet (but not from PC2), and
you'll find the packets heading off to the default gateway on the 192.168.200.x
network and not reaching PC2 at all.  There lies your problem.

You need to run the first route above command, but without the "dev
ath0" bit, on
all machines on your WiLan.  And conversely, you need to run the second route
command without the "dev eth0" bit on all machines in the wired LAN.

Absolutely no routing needs to be setup on PC2.  It's fine as is.


Alternately, hooking up the WiLAN card to the default gateway on 192.168.200.x
network should also do the trick.

Dear friends,

I spoke to Mr. Balamurali  of CSC department, I discussed with Mr. Raman
Over phone. We can have workshop and exhibition  on 18th of march(Saturday)
and 19th of march(Sunday). I think if a/series of workshop taken on 18th

managing/handling/supporting the exhibition.
Mr. Balamurali of Arunai Engg College has extended his management
hospitality,Logistics and Machine/material support. Now we have to finalise
the itenary for the workshop & exhibition.

There will be a college bus sent to chennai to pick up ilugc members and
return them back to chennai after the programme.
Good hospitality will be provided.
Machinary support will be provided.
They have 2 Lcds at present in the csc dept. Additional requirement of lcd

We need to know how many of us are available for the event.

Kindly chern the process by giving participation/commenting/supporting with
suggestion for the event.

Thanking you,

Hi all,

I am new to RAID configurations.
I have a system yet to be configured as database server with 3 x 144 SCSI disks in 'hardware'-RAID-5 with 8GB RAM.
Do i also need a separate harddisk to be used as a system  disk ? do i need to mount each disk as a single parition ? or can i sub partition the SCSI disks ?
what do u suggest ? 

regards,
KM

To conduct an exhibition with just one day's workshop
prior to it? 

Forgive me for my ignorance, but, can you answer these
please:

1. Have students used GNU/Linux in the college? If
yes, for what purpose? Browsing, chatting, application
development, R&D?

2. Have students done FLOSS projects online?

3. How many hours do students spend their time in the
labs in the college?

4. Are there any companies in the campus doing
projects with students?

5. Do students know any foreign language?

6. How many courses/labs do students do per semester?

7. Do students/faculty get Internet access 24x7? What
about hostel students?

8. Can students/faculty use mobile phones/laptops in
the college premises?

9. Are students/faculty allowed to bring floppies/USB
flash disks/CDs to college and use it in the labs?

10. Are Saturdays working days or are they holidays?
If holidays, what do most students do during weekends?

IMO, we need to do few workshops, let students learn,
and then proceed to conduct an exhibition where
students are in a good position to answer queries to
visitors. 

If its a *management* decision then ... no comments.

Return on Saturday or on Sunday? How long does it take
to travel to and fro?

   I think we can have workshop on saturday and exhibition on sunday. The
lecturing team can go earlier in a car to thiruvanmalai. If  one/all of the
lecturing team wants to return back to chennai on the same day they can be
ported back. The lecturing and installation team can leave around 6 am on
18th of march 2006. It takes 3 to 4 hours of safe driving by car. It is
~200km.

 The exhibiting team can leave chennai by 3pm by a college bus. The
exhibition team will land up in thiruvanamalai in evening and take rest at a
hotel or campus facility (depending upon the choice of ilugc member). On
return , each member will be dropped at the nearest point of their
destination.

ILUGC has to take care of tech side of the exhibition. The students
there are, as far as thiagu knows, do not have linux knowledge. We
need atleast 15-20 ilugc volunteers to conduct exhibition.

We thought of one day workshop before the show, for small group of
students to familarise them with linux, so that they will be helpful
in arranging system, loading linux/running livecd etc. and provide
support on demoing easy stuff like browser,office tools, edu software
etc. Only 2-3 of us for this workshop.

Your long list of questions has negative answer in atleast 98 percent
of colleges.

Yes that is best as we do in MIT.  However this one is purely ILUGC
show and college providing infrastructure.

glade generates all the ui code - so you can learn coding by playing 
around with it - although i personally dont like screen builders, 
in the long run its more efficient to do it by hand

Pl. post your dmesg output while connecting USB Data cable in the Linux

with 25 and 26th of march 2005. They are having some engagement on 18 and
19.


We plan to have 20 Exhibit stalls. Each one of the member of ilugc will be
assisted by two students.

They(arunai engg college)  will arrange for media coverage about the event.

2 or 3 of us can visit them on 19th of march for a preparatory meet to
address the volunteer students.
It is proposed that the preparatory panel will start by 6:30 am 19th march
2006 by car and reach the campus, deliver technical stuff to the
volunteers.Take stock of machine arrangements, dimension of exhibition hall,
labour and logistics facility.And return back home on the same day around
9pm in chennai at max.

The workshop will be organised on 25th of march 2006 saturday and Exhibition
on 26th of march 2006.

The workshop panel members and the installation team  will start by 6:30 am
  of 25th of march 2006 from chennai and reach the campus  by ~10
am.Logistics will be kept ready at a common place in chennai.

 Workshop will run with lunch breaks till evening 4:30pm.Mean while the
installation team can install the distros and needed appz on the machine for
the next day exhibition.

By 6:00pm 25th march there will be a car kept  for  member(s) of ilugc  to

afford to contribute one day to the event.

Depending upon the ilugc volunteer population car/college bus transit will
be arranged. There will be car/bus which will leave chennai on 25th of march
around 4:30pm and reach thiruvanamalai by 8:00pm.

i am trying to set up virtual mailboxes in deban sarge using

when i use textfiles and hash. But when i use mysql database, it 
doesnt work, but there are no error messages like 'fatal open mysql

Incidently i am having the same problem with courier imap and the 
database. I have also tried it with postgresql, with the same

GtkTree is deprecated and now unsupported in GTK 2.0, It is known to be
buggy. To use it in GTK2.0, you must define the symbol GTK_ENABLE_BROKEN
prior to including the GTK+ header files.
http://www.gtk.org/tutorial2.0/

I do all my GNOME+GTK development with Glade, don't know much about
Anjuta IDE. AFAIK Anjuta is a promising young IDE that internally uses
libglade for code building. Also I really don't relay on Glade's code
building capability either. What I do is, create UI framework with
glade, and later do all coding and necessary build system changes all
through an external editor. For accessing the UI from the *.glade file
at runtime, I use libglade library.

There are two useful tool in fedora dist - devhelp and gtk-demo, which I
think will be help full.

Hi,

Mr. Raman said  an idea which works better,

Alternatively, if many volunteers feel comfortable we leave chennai
on 26th morning 6am and start exhibition activities immediately on
arrival at the venue.


instead of the exhibitors of ilugc start by 4:30 pm on 25th march 06, they
can start on 26th morning 6 am. kindly let us know if problem in the thread.

Cheers

Hello All,

Good to hear about the progress of LDD and Workshop at AEC, Thiruvannamalai.

Think I will miss it.

I am at NIT Calicut on those days for the FOSS Meet 2006. Speaking on Icarus 
Verilog/FOSS EDA tools.

@Thiyagu -> Can the meet be rescheduled ;)

Anyways I have a suggestion. Is it really a neccesary for a exhibition? Dont 
you think instead of a exhibition some kind of a Hands on sessions can be 
planned for the students/faculty and also expose them to some real time FOSS 
Projects? Since *Management* has agreed to provide material support also 
this should not be a problem.
One more thing to note is that the students must not be forced to attend the 
workshop. Instead enough curiosity must be created prior to the workshops by 
posters / some other means. This of course is the responsibility of the 
Management. But think someone from ILUGC can do a remote supervision.

@Shakthi -> The Free Software for engineers thing can be made even more fun 
if Hands on session is planned.

Someone can handle Install Fest kind of.. Some Q&A sessions on specific 
topics can be organised. I know I am giving a lot of suggestion without 
volunteering for anything. Sorry, I have already commited to NIT, Calicut on 
the same dates. Also if there is last minute change I will inform ILUGC :)

Kindly comment on the above suggestions.

Thanks and Regards,
Aanjhan

Hello All,

Sorry. Somehow I missed the dates.. I saw it as 18th,19th of March 2006 
[which is when the FOSS meet @NITC is happening]. But i think it has been 
changed to 25th 26th of March 2006. :)

@Thiyagu -> No need to change the date :) It has been changed already. :))


I am available for the LDD then!!!

I volunteer to give speech on

1. FOSS EDA tools for VLSI
2. Embedded Linux for Beginners [would have got upgraded to intermediate 
level when I present at NITC :)] But let the topic be for Beginners :)

3. Any hands on Sessions on EDA tools, Install Fests I volunteer.

Thanks and Regards,
Aanjhan

Its called top-posting. Please don't do that in the

Use a meaningful subject line.

[What you see below is called bottom-posting. Always

For 2.6 kernels:

During kernel build, you will do:

 make modules_install

This will install your modules to /lib/modules/2.6.x.

To create a initial ramdisk image do:

 mkinitrd -o initrd.img-2.6.x 2.6.x

Replace 2.6.x with your compiled kernel version. 

Initial ramdisk image is a temporary filesystem for
loading necessary modules during bootup. Initially
when the kernel boots there is no filesystem, but, you
want your driver modules to load and get initialised
during boot. Hence, the use of a ramdisk.

I will not be available all weekends prior to March
25, 2006.

AFAIK, we don't have any ILUGC meet scheduled yet. If
you would like to take the initiative, you are welcome
to do so.

With regard to AEC, and the new dates, I will not be
able to come for the planning on Saturday, March 18,
2006, but, would like to confirm my availability for
both the days, March 25, 26, 2006.

I believe you are in touch with Raman (MIT), who is
coordinating the event on behalf of ILUGC. 

Please CC any correspondence to me so I know what's
going on, or simply send it to the ILUGC mailing list.

Thanks for the offer.

I feel we can have regular weekly Gnu/Linux vidyashram classes at MIT
and monthly meet as usual at IITM. 

The students of MIT have been requesting for this kind of classes for
long.

Somehow I missed this mail.

Presently the regular ILUGC Monthly meetings are held in IIT-M. So We
can start conducting the tutorial sessions in AU-KBC. Later we can
move few ILUGC regular meeting to AU-KBC.

If i am not wrong, this faq tells how to prevent not what we will do if 
i already has done "rm".
correct?  Solution is not clear. As i googled i found some tool

http://recover.sourceforge.net/linux/

I think it can do. But i don't have experience on it or i never used it. 
Though it can be usefull..
Thanks

My point is simple, no tool is reliable for recovering your file after an rm.

BTW the tool that you've mentioned works only with Ext2 file system.

If the FS is Ext3, this will NOT help. If FS is Ext2, then you can
give a try.

Hi prasanth,
It is true. But we are opensource enthuastic. So we will always try to 
look for open source tool.
I think it is propitary right?
I didn't find any free tool on that page. If u found please let me know.
As i saw this page , this tool are based on windows OS based. We need 
linux based tool (ofcourse open source).
What u say??? :-)

Message-ID: <4408479D.8080801@gmail.com>

   Hi Linuxians,

   Wanted to propose this before, why don't we slightly reschedule the
   timings of lug-meets. As i have office on almost all the saturdays, am
   missing a lot of these precious moments. Also, a lot of other members have
   college/office on staurdays that they aren't able to attend the lug meets.
   Why dont we have it around 6 pm or better have it on sundays, when we
   don't have time restrictions ?? ( don't say sunday is the only day we
   spend @ home :D )

(These comments are my own, and let the majority prevail, I am only
putting forth my view)

True. But Saturday evening would make it a bit uncomfortable. When the
meet starts at 3 PM (actually, 3:30 PM most of the times), it goes on
up to even 6:30 most of the times. Now, if such a meet begins at 6:00
PM, I can certainly see many people having to reschedule dinner (I am
one of them!), and those without vehicles finding it a bit hard to get
home (I am here too!).

Sunday may be a good idea, though I am personally against it; for
Sunday is the best time to finish unfinished work, and, well I just
can't offer you the reason, but I wouldn't want to schedule anything
on Sunday. But if most people do want to come on a Sunday, I guess I
can make it, but then; with Monday lurking nearby, it just feels
odd...

However, as I said, let the majority prevail.

Kumar

Desktops too and show Linux running in laptops and tell students  that
Linux is ready for desktop.I can bring my laptop which is running Mandriva

Linux poses a real challenge for those with a taste for late-nighthacking (and/or conversations with God).- Matt Welsh

Linux is not user-friendly. It _is_ user-friendly. It is not ignorant-friendly and idiot-friendly.-Unknown

Waving away a cloud of smoke, I look up, and am blinded by a bright, whitelight. It's God. No, not Richard Stallman, or Linus Torvalds, but God. In a booming voice, He says: "THIS IS A SIGN. USE LINUX, THE FREE UNIX SYSTEM FOR THE 386." -Matt Welsh

Microsoft isn't evil, they just make really crappy operating systems.

Hello All,

Wow.. SSN accepted for a LDD on SAturday.. ugh! How much I tried for a 
single lecture.. Anyways, Good news. My college has realised it atlast.

Regarding the Schedule..

Seems good. But me not available then. I will definitely miss it because its 
my college :(.

Can we add some LAMP tutorials and also something related to Electronics in 
the schedule?

Other than that its fine..

Most of the private colleges seem to be waking upto
FOSS(atlast).Credit goes to the students(fanatics? ;) who are making
sure that the management wakes up and notices.

<rant>
We are however still a long way from how academia and FOSS can
co-exist.Heck, I'll go ahead and say it.. Even the IIT's are not at
the same level that UCB/MIT were in the early 1980's.

Come to think of it, engineers being produced out of Factories today
really really need a Indian version of Bill Joy.It need'nt be a IIT
which delivers that.Future engineers today need a "hero" who delivers
on the Innovation front.

What Chennai based engineering colleges need is *one* annual event
spread over a week and kept trully academic and encompasses FOSS and
other (computer related technologies,Shaastra doesn't count).It neednt
be competetive.Maybe something held in June-July(hols!) wherein
students can meetup and present seminars/workshops/share idea's and
even showcase what they did for their annual projects.

I just wish the FOSS scene was better when I was a student.
</rant>

Anyway, keep up the good work guys..

Let this first workshop be an introduction.

We will do the electronics, GNU embedded/VLSI on a
separate day. Lot of time needs to be spent on these,
like how we did at IIT-M.

I would interested in contributing to the following topic:

Topics
* Apache , possible write some simple php code that interacts with
mysql (don't expect highly complex and sofisticed code here. I didn't
meant this to show the coding capabilites & its meant to be a intro to
the capabilities of the s/w not the lang.).

* Squid - An into into the capabilites of squid. Possible add a little
bit about ntop & show the networking montoring capablities of ntop.

What would be the ilugc suggestion for this?

with regards,
ashwin

Me too trying something similar to this. What I want to do
is to direct the mails reaching a user' mail account to a
database table(MySQL).

Mails are fetched with fetchmail utility(POP3).The procmail
which is invoked on the arrival of a mail adds the mail to
the database with the help of a python script. The python
script uses mailbox module of python1.5.

Is your method simpler than this??

Storing adhoc files in database tables (esp MySQL) is a bad idea.
Databases are not designed for this (ab)use.  Store the emails as files
and keep file names only in the DB.  That's a far better approach.

Believe me.  I hold ~300k emails, ~25GB table size and MySQL makes
me very unhappy.

On 4.3.06 I had discussion with Arunai Engg College 
Faculty+management and Mr.Srinivasan of NRCFOSS,MIT. The following
decisions were made

1.Preparatory technical session. This will be held on 18th Mar 
instead of 19th as posted in List. This session will be confined
to about 25-30 students who will be volunteers for the LDD. This
will not have formal shape of a seminar. Instead ILUGC will
send 2-3 volunteers who will conduct hands on session to students
on installation, basic operations and intro to things which 
students can practice in one week and exhibit in the LDD. 
e.g Openoffice and other such office tools, browsers, 
multimedia tools line xine, educational software for school 
children etc.

2.Technical Seminar on 25th March: About 250-300 (the size of the
auditorium) will be attending the seminar. The participants will
be students from Arunai and few other engg/science colleges in and
around Thiruvannamalai. Only interested students will be asked to
attend seminar. The students will not be forced to  sit for the sake
of crowd. The topics will be decided by ILUGC. The exact schedule I
will post after consolidating the volunteers, the topics they chose
etc.

3.Public LDD on 26th March: The college authorities expect about
3000-4000 visitors. They will be giving publicity through media and
also by sending invitation/posters to colleges all over TN. There
will
be some 20 stalls allocated to us. They are trying to get some
sponsors also and they made need some stalls. However, all such
stalls
will be opensource related.

4.The college will provide facility for transportation, stay etc to
the ILUGC volunteers. By 18th we have to give how many of us will be
attending the 25th and 26th event. The travel time will be about 3
hours from MIT,Chromepet. From inside city it might be 1 hour more.
After consolidating the volunteer list let us decide ideal location
to
start.

5. The quality of technical session, demos etc are now the
responsibility of ILUGC, in what seems to me the biggest ever LDD
conducted by us. I request atleast 50 luggies to volunteer for the
events.

Raman.P

All USB devices are not given sda device node. It all depends on the
availabilty of the free SCSI bus(device). Just look out for dmesg output
after plugging in your USB device. The output when I connect my card
reader is something as follows which says that the device is attached to
sdd.

Which kernel? Open a terminal and post output of:

 /bin/uname -r

I use Debian Sarge with 2.6.12.3 kernel. Recent
distros with 2.6 kernels use udev, and they should
automatically mount the filesystem for you.

In 2.4 kernels devfs is used, and hence you will need
to mount the filesystem by checking the output of
/bin/dmesg for the device filename.

Which USB thumb drive?

Greetings!

I would like to thank Kongu LUG, management, Prof.
Jayapathi, HOD, CSE department, staff and students of
Kongu Engineering College for the opportunity to
conduct a one-day "GNU Embedded/VLSI" workshop at
Kongu Engineering College, Perundurai, Erode on
Saturday, March 4, 2006.

Special thanks to Vijay Anand, final year, CSD for
working with me for the past couple of weeks in
coordinating the event.

The photos taken during the presentation can be viewed
from:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album24

The VHDL code examples and presentation can be
downloaded from:

http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/embedded-howto/

* I spent about an hour and a half with the students
in the morning in their RMS laboratory (09:00 to
10:30). 

* Morning session was on "Embedded GNU/Linux labs
HOWTO" (10:30 to 12:30). 

* Lunch was between 12:30 and 14:00.

* Afternoon session was on "Alliance VLSI CAD tools
HOWTO" (14:00 to 16:00)

* KEC have started an FM studio (90.4 MHz) for
listeners in and around (10 km radius) Erode. So, they
caught me by surprise and conducted an interview. The
questions were on free software, higher education,
GNU/Linux community work etc. 

* They were using soundforge as suggested by the
management. I had told them about Audacity and how I
use it on GNU/Linux for sound recording/editing etc. 

* I have asked for a copy of the same, if possible, so
I can upload it. It should be aired on March 13, 2006,
sometime between 1630 to 1930 in Erode.

Regards,

SK

Hello Raman and fellow linuxians,

It great to hear that there are some LUG activities on the following 
weekends. As far as Arunai LDD is considered, am ready to take up 
OpenOffice as usual. If its necessary for me to be there on 25th, as per 
Raman's plan of explaining some 20-30 ppl of 25th, I would try to make 
it. But, am surely there of 26th. Put me in for OpenOffice or otherwise 
whatever the ilug-c requires.. ( which i can handle) :)

Cheers to the Tux !

Message-ID: <a54a308e0603051044r4b8ce7c2g9b10c6f7bbf47ab@mail.gmail.com>

*Yoper 3.0 Beta (Blacksand) released*

The team, together with lead-developer Tobias Gerschner, are proud to
announce the start of the public beta-testing phase of Yoper GNU/Linux.
After the last official 2.1 release (2004) and the last beta release
2.2(2005), things became quiet at Yoper. Andreas Girardet, the founder
and
long-time
developer of Yoper, resigned as Yoper lead developer in 2005 and handed over
the duties to Tobias Gerschner.

After rewriting all internal scripts, the inclusion of the Kanotix
hardware-detection, a completely overhauled command line installer, a brand
new GUI-installer (written from scratch) and several internal (and thus
unannounced) alpha-releases, the time for public beta-testing has come.

The 623 MB ISO-file includes Kernel 2.6.15, Xorg 6.8.2, etcnet, KDE 3.5.0,
Koffice, Firefox 1.5, Thunderbird 1.5 and lots of other cutting-edge
packages.

Hello everyone,

          I am not sure if I have to welcome myself if I were to participate
in chennailug. Neverthless, I ll keep my introductions short.

I'am Venkatesh doing my final year computer science at S.R.M Engineering
college (Yeh, I know). I really like this idea of chennailug. I was a
passive member of this list for quite sometime , but never bothered to check
what the fuss was all about. I am getting interested in this community now.
Hope you would embrace me...

I am using Fedora core 3 and Open Suse 10.0 for over a year. Though I cannot
call myself a hardcore geek or a linux savant, am mildly interested in FOSS
and programming.

P.S: The guys behind this lug are doign a great job. Few people who push all
others towards freedom. Keep it up.
P.P.S: I hope this will not be flagged as spam.

Probably my last post being too long lead to some confusion. Let me
clarify the programme again

1.18th Mar: Training session for 25 Arunai Student volunteers. Only
3/4 luggies required for this. At present we have them.

2.25th Mar: Linux Seminar to over 250 students from different engg
college. This may last for about 5 hours on different topics. Give me
two days time to post schedule(based on volunteers).

3.26th LDD: It will be LDD open to public. The college management
would like it to be a mega event with attendance of over 4000
visitors atleast. This event is what more LUG volunteers are needed
on, any and every topic.

Thank you for correcting my mistakes (both bad english and
database abuse). Then, i'm not trying to direct the entire
mail into the databse. I parse the mail, extract the
required infos say, from and to mail address, subject, time
and 160 bytes of actual mail. Then add these infos to the
database. I do this to build a email indication system for
a subscriber end integrated phone.

Hope i'm making myself clear. Presently i use procmail and
mailbox module of pyhton library to do this.

Hi ,

This what i have been asking the list sometime. Nobody seems to reply
in list. I dont think u would get any reply either. Possible reasons:
* List members are busy
* Those who would like to reply dont know about it & those who know,
dont wanna reply or busy right now.
* We havent framed the question intelligently enough.

Arun & others: do not take it personally. Its meant to be a pun.

with regards,
ashwin

Bharathi, can you let us know the following from SSN:

* Transportation (pickup and drop) for volunteers to
SSN College of Engineering on Saturday, March 18,
2006.

* Propopsed schedule for the event.

* Availability of projector for presentations/talks.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <20060306070754.53662.qmail@web8610.mail.in.yahoo.com>


Hi,

 I installed fedora core 4, in my system and was
trying to configure my Sify BB internet connection
with it. I some how failed(unable to ping default
gateway). Please let me know where i am going wrong,
These are the steps i followed.

 Configured the eth0 interface with the static IP,
Primary DNS, Secondary DNS and the Default Gateway
which the ISP provided me.

  Checked with ifconfig command for ensuring my
configurations. It reflected those values.

 The eth0 connection shows active but still i am not
able ping the default gateway, ping returns
"Destination host unreachable". I tried doing it by
disabling firewall but did not work.

 I also checked the files in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts they seemed to have the
proper information.

 I also checked the default kernel IP routing table
using netstat -nr command.It seems to be fine.

 Traceroute to default gatewary shows something like
following
 1 localhost xxxx.xx ms !H xxxx.xx ms !H xxxx.xx ms !H

 I am just a beginner as far as linux goes, This was
all i can do by reffering some books :(
 Please let me know if i am missing something.

 And a word of Thanks to Bharathi and Thyagu who were
of great help to me in getting the Fedora Linux
CD's.Three cheers for ILUG on coming activities :)

Regards,
Gokul

Does anyone here know whether enabling SMART on a IDE disk decreases
the performance (I/O rate, latency etc.) of the disk? In general, are
there any tradeoffs involved? And how effective/important is using
something like smartd for a single user desktop? Are there any special

It does have a performance tradeoff but nothing significant compared to 
a potential data loss.

Depends on the importance of the data on your system. Of course you 
wouldnt just rely on smart and do regular backups if you care about that.

Additional checks would consume more power but these are trivial.  Smart 
is generally useful for servers where a failing storage device needs to 
be phased out and replaced in a planned manner.

Is any quantification possible? because I recently turned on smart and
disk throughput has decreased significantly. I would like to know if
these changes are correlated.

Hi all,

Greetings. Sorry for the late reply. I would like to
introduce myself, i'm K.narendran and i'm co-ordinating the
First LDD in SSN college from ILUGC side. I thank Bharathi
for taking initiatives. Now that the date of the event is
fixed on 18th of this march, I'm going to SSN college on
11th to prepare the student and arrange for the event. I
would like know the volunteers who could help in this.

If you are concerned enough you could do some trivial benchmarking with 
hdparm and friends. The tradeoff is getting better performance vs early 
warning on potential disk failures.

What is the network setup? Is it a USB-based modem or
ethernet-based modem.

Is your connection a Plain Old Telephone System
dial-up or is it ADSL technology?

If its plain old dial-up, you will need to use KPPP or
wvdial.

If its ADSL, PPP over Ethernet, then you can use the
roaring penguin client, rp-pppoe (adsl-start,
adsl-stop , etc.).

Hi Shakthi,

 Its more kind of a LAN kind of network they provide,
Its just ethernet card in my system which is cabled to
the cable operators system or host.

 I am not sure how it proceeds from there, But there
is no modem kind of thing that comes to the picture on
my end.

 How it usually works in my end in windows is to
create a new LAN connection with the information such
as IP, Pri DNS, Sec DNS and all those stuff they have
provided and thats all.

 I hope it answers your question. Please let me know
if you have more questions.

Regards,
Gokul

Subject: [Ilugc] running linux with old hardware
Message-ID: <440BFFEC.3070609@naturesoft.net>

hi all,
First i am introducing myself.
I am suman adak,doing M.Tech(CS) from DAVV,indore. I am from 
calcutta(bengali). I am doing my final year project
at naturesoft pvt. Limited(www.nature-soft.com). Also i am doing as 
technology solution analyst.
I was a member of this group nearly one week back. I found realy very 
good. I was also a member of ilug-calcutta.
I don't know chennai properly, So i could not able to attend this 
workshop.i am in chennai past 6 months..

I read the topic listed for SSN college. I want to add one extra 
topic(if possible later) , if u people agree with me..It's only my thinking

I have p4 1.8 GHz system with 128 MB  RAM. But when i tried install SUSE 
9.3. it was installed but it was so slow that i could not able to run 
multiple task at a time. I think it is only for memory leakeage. Then i 
stated thinking  what should i do...
I gooled i found one distribution which will run smoothly on 64 MB run. 
Puppy Linux(with feature). Still not so first.
Then i am thinking what are the component,which takes more memory. So 
realized KDE or GNOME is taking more.
Other also. Now i started to research which component are best for old 
hardware..if i use openoffice it is also taking memory and also slow. 
Can i replace with abiword? I replaced it and i found that O.K good. I 
can do my regular work with abiword. No problem. So now i think another 
part also. How many deomons is running which is not needed at all for 
normal use. People would be happy if the can run linux on their old 
hardware. 
like that we can give the complete system with light weight application  
which will run superfast with all required  features in old hardware system.
We can make one distribution and we will give people who have old system 
and feedback to us "performance". We will try to improve..
One of the guy from ILUG-CAL started this project, He has given those 
software which will be run with out any problem with old hardware. I am 
giving this link

Running Linux GUI SuperFast with OLD H/W [PART-I]
http://jbakshi.50webs.com/PART-I/INDEX.html

Running Linux GUI SuperFast with OLD H/W [PART-II]
http://jbakshi.50webs.com/PART-II/INDEX.html

I think we can start thinking on that. Later we can try to deliver one session where student or people can get idea how to run linux in their old system. It can also be feasible for college who are stacking all thair old system in one room or still they are thinking linux will not be run in those system.

When i was using SifyBB at my home, even after doing the LAN Settings, they
provided me with a small tool to connect to sify network with Username and
Password both in Windows and Linux.I was using it in WinXP and FC3.Do ask
the Client Connectivity tool from Sify.It can be downloaded from their LAN
site directly for Linux and  Windows.

I agree with you. But now most of college are having Hi-Fi PCs like 
AMD 64Bit Processors, P4 etc... No one wants to try something with old 
PC. Bcoz AICT norms says "Low end PC must an P4 in college, Otherwise 
No grade."

Recently in one engg college, Replaced all its AMD 64Bit PCs with P4
PCs, due to the above condition. :)

O.K , We can just tell student that we can run linux on old PC.

I think some Student does't have high end PC(Home).They will be interested.
Moreever it can be one of the awareness that we can run linux fast with 
out problem in old PC..

Actually my thinking is , What  should I do with old hardware(No matter 
college are using Hi-Fi
or not)?. One is running linux without no problem.....

Second is
Making clustering with openMosix...(not like beowulf clustering)..

We can make clustering(openMosix) on these old PC to become a powerfull 
machine also.

This is one of the approch we can think(User may not be always college 
student also)....

So what u say?

The colleges, generally are having upgraded PCs. However, "Linux on old PC"
might be of use to students and other visitors (since most LDDs get visitors
from schools, etc.).

Further, some of the managements "donate" the old PCs to schools and other
agencies (which are under their extended control). Linux on them could be a
value addition to the user and give a bigger spread the Open Source culture.

Well, I'd not consider that "old hardware"... My first Linux install was an 
old RH 5.0 on a P1 100MHz with 32 MB RAM. I also recently installed Ubuntu 
5.10 on a P1 233MHz Toshiba Tecra laptop with 96 MB RAM, and my first Gentoo 
installation was on a P3 933 with 128 RAM. That install is still more or less 
alive, though transplanted to another system. Openoffice, KDE or Gnome and 
everything else on the last two systems...

What I'm trying to say is that nothing above the P2 level is really "old" 
hardware as far as installing most things goes. It'll be dog slow, and half 
the features won't work, but you can install it without trouble. And there 
are a lot of stories about 486s and early Pentiums still running web servers 
Out There. Throwing away hardware just because it's not cutting edge is 
simply wasteful.

Message-ID: <feff2f50603060741l2ac98e9cqb096a226f611175b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ,

I had similar problem few days ago . But I resolved it !!

Sify client for Linux is poorly written . Sify client doesnt connect to the
sify server for authentication on all Linux based OS.

But I came across a command line sify client for Windows called supersify

http://broadbandforum.in/sify/supersify/

I used Wine binary along with supersify . Guess what happend next!! It
worked .

Supersify is command based and accepts arguments for username , password and
MAC address also

ex:
wine supersify.exe -u "username" -p password -m macaddress -o ( for login )

wine supersify.exe -u "username" -p password -m macaddress -l ( for logout )

Note: Sify will allow you to connect if and only if you supply the MAC
address . So just type "ifconfig" to get your MAC address and supply it
along with the argument(-m)

If your current kernel version is different from the
patched kernel, then you need to create one, manually.

Make a copy of your current kernel sources. Make
necessary changes and create a patch using:

 diff -urn original.sources/ patched.sources/ >
patch-file.txt

To apply the patch enter into the original.sources
directory, and do:

 cd /path/to/original.sources
 patch -p0 < /path/to/patch-file.txt

Depends on what level of resilience you are looking for. Is 100%
uptime a criterion? Then you need to keep your OS on at least RAID1
mirrored disks. Is it just data availability? Then the OS can be on a
non-RAID disk with the data on RAID5 arrays.

>  i have read abt software raid configuration. but donot know how different it is from hardware raid config.

Typically the controller vendor would have a management program (with
or without a Linux version). Even more typically, the management
program would be closed source. This is one of the points of
contention between the OpenBSD guys and other Free Unix/Unix clone
developers (FreeBSD, Linux etc.).

For example, I use the HP SmartArray 6i controller on my servers. They
come with a management program called, very innovatively, Array
Configuration Utility (ACU). I can define RAID levels, manage the
disks, look up status, change RAID level losslessly and generally, a
lot of things using this management program. The SCSI disks are in a
StorageWorks 14-drive array, adding up to about 850 GB of RAID5
storage. That takes care of the data, and since I also need 100%
uptime, I have a separate pair of disks on my server (Proliant DL380)
in RAID1 (hanging off the same controller) that has my Linux
installation.

Don't try with FC Kernel, it may be customized. Use the original

Try patching the kernel version 2.6.9. Download it from the net if required.
Disable all power management (apm support) from the kernel and compile
after applying the patch.
Read the README that comes along with the patch for details regarding
the compilation.

Check out the site of fsmlabs for further details and FAQ. The site
maintains an archive of posts that might be useful.

As i have already mentioned, i am going on 11th(this
saturday) to SSN College in order to train some volunteers
intially and make some arrangement. The volunteer may need 
to spend at the most a half day in the college. Based on 
response of volunteers for this training session on 11th, i 
will arrange and announce the transport.


Transport for the 18th LDD has been decided.

Transport has been arranged for the volunteers. A vehicle
will run from adyar to SSN College, Kalavakkam and back to
adyar. It will start from adyar at around 7:30 am and will
reach college by 8:30 am. The event gets over by 3:30 pm and
the volunteers will dropped back in adyar.

What does pkg-config glib-2.0 --modversion report?

The RAID5 setup is for hosting a database. data availability is the primary criterion. i will be storing only the database and related data in the raid disks.
how do i plan to setup a nonraid disk for OS (linux) and data disks on RAID5.

>From googling i knew that hardware raid disks are seen as a single disk for the OS after setting raid5 from BIOS. Then where is the parity info stored in the disks assuming that each of the raid5 disks are wholly single partition.

how can i plan the OS partitions  and raid disks ? Now if i use 3 SCSI in raid5 and a nonraid disk for OS then should i use software raid to connect both ?

KM

In RAID5, one disk will be used entirely to store the parity
information. Thus with n disks in RAID5, you get storage worth
(n-1)*size of 1 disk.

These hardware RAID controllers will present the arrays to the host OS
- sometimes as regular SCSI drives (/dev/sda or so) or as specialized
devices (/dev/cciss/c0d0, for example). Your regular OS disk will be
presented by its driver - say /dev/sdb. It might be a good idea to use
a live CD distro to see the exact details.

If you have a off-the-shelf server, just boot it normally and use its
first-boot configuration program to setup RAID the way you desire. If
not, I'd recommend disconnecting the disks/arrays you intend to be in
RAID5, install the OS as usual, connect these disks, configure RAID
and then mkfs.whatever.

I'd recommend RHEL4 for a distro.

Hope this is the problem of finding the path of pkg-config. If your are installing gtk from /usr/local the path of pkg-config can be taken as /usr/local/bin and the path of gtk+2.0.pc is /usr/local. If your are installing it in /usr the path of pkg-config is /usr/bin and path of
gtk+2.0.pc is /usr. Try to set the path of pkg-config accordingly.

ya -  that lets me plan resultant diskspace.
So i have planned to setup 3 SCSI disks in hardware-raid5 and one OS disk separately.

Assuming that /dev/sda is the hardware-raid5 (3 SCSI disks)  array presented to the host OS, if i fill data onto the raid5 array, how do i know  which raid5-SCSI array disk holds that data (excepting one of the raid5 disk which stores parity info) or its hidden from the OS point of view?

Also just for my info, is raid 6 being implemented in Linux as of now ?

Thought of formatting partitions as reiserfs as we have lots of small files.

what abt fedora4 x86-64 bit edition ? what other Linux flavours do one recommend ? 
what abt chunk size setting especially when i use reiserfs ?

Sorry, I have made a mistake the path of the pkg-config is either /usr/local/lib or /usr/lib depending on whether you install at /usr/local or /usr

Since you have compiled glib-2 yourself (and assuming you haven't
provided a prefix), it would be installed under /usr/local.  So, set
the PKG_CONFIG_PATH accordingly for this to work.

shell> export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/pkgconfig

Good. Anyway, with 3 disks, RAID5 is the optimal solution. :)

The OS should not be concerned with that. The controller or driver
should implement data storage techniques and could even depend on data
access conditions.

No idea about reiserfs. Fedora should be OK too, but RHEL will fetch
you with guaranteed support for the next 5 or 7 years (forgot which)
whereas each Fedora version will be supported only for the next 18
months or so. You are no longer a hobbyist, but are playing with
someone's production data :)

Hi,

On 3/8/06, km <km@mrna.tn.nic.in> wrote:
> Assuming that /dev/sda is the hardware-raid5 (3 SCSI disks)  array presented to the host OS, if i fill data onto the raid5 array, how do i know  which raid5-SCSI array disk holds that data (excepting one of the raid5 disk which stores parity info) or its hidden from the OS point of view?

RAID5 does not store parity information on a single physical disk.  Parity is
spread over all the disks in your array.

Whenever a disk block on a RAID 5 array is written, the parity information
needs to be recomputed and updated - results in a parity disk read and write
operation. If you had all the parity on a single disk (as in RAID4), the write
speed of your entire array reduces to the speed of your parity disk.

Therefore in RAID5, the parity blocks are distributed throughout the entire
array.  This eliminates the parity disk from becoming a bottleneck.

Eg. For disk block 1, the parity could be on physical disk disk 1.  For block 2,
the parity is on disk 2, and so on.  For disk block 4, parity is on disk 1.


However, this also increases complexity during disaster recovery.  If the
RAID controller goes fubar, and even if you know the on-disk data structures
of your proprietary RAID controller, manually recovery is virtually impossible.
In a RAID1 or RAID10 system, the task is far easier.

Further,  RAID1 and RAID10 avoid the expensive parity computation and this
makes software RAID much more practical.  Rebuild time in RAID5 arrays
is proportional to the size of the entire array.  For large arrays, this may be
several hours, and for this reason many SAN vendors do not use RAID5.

The downside with RAID1 or RAID10 is that you lose 50% of disk capacity
for redundancy.  With RAID5 the overheads are far smaller.  If you can
tolerate such high overhead, I would recommend RAID1, but it does not
sit nicely with your 3 disk configuration.  You need to think through this a bit
more.

One of the machines I run is an IBM server with Adaptec RAID and 8 ~150GB
SCSI HDDs.  If the machine dies, I'm totally at IBM's mercy for a replacement.
And until the replacement arrives, I can't in any way make the data
available for
production.  For those who've signed expensive IBM AMCs I suppose this is
less of an issue.

Software RAID on commodity hardware (NForce/Intel ICH6/8, SATA HDDs)
looks like a very attractive/safe alternative.  If the machine does down, just
pull out your HDDs and plug them into any old machine and you are back
online.

You're completely in control of both the software (linux) and the hardware
(commodity).  I that's exactly how I'd want it to be.

Ofcourse, these are just my views.  You need to figure out what's best for
your situation.

Debian?  But the 64bit port is not yet ready for production use.  If
you can live
without 64bit features, Debian offers you and endless stream of
excellent quality
packages.  Apt makes software installation, upgrades and system maintenance
a breeze.

If your primary intent is to run proprietary software - Oracle, etc. -
then it's wise
to go with your vendor's recommendation.

Reiserfs always uses a 4k block size.  Nothing to tune here.

Choosing the wrong RAID chunk size can kill performance.  The only way to
be sure is to try various RAID chunk sizes and benchmark. Bonnie is your friend.

    1. Demanding for immediate help is generally not welcome.
    2. If you want urgent help, post your questions clearly:
        a. start by using a sensible subject line,
        b. show people that you've thought through your problem,
        c. use clear language to describe your problem

Then, if the right person comes along at the right time, you get an answer.

first study the 'tar' command. For backup to a remote server, 
'rsync' command is good. You could also put important directories 
under version control with subversion. And to do all this 
automatically at regular intervals, the 'cron' command is 
essential. The syntax of these commands can be got my using the man 
pages, example:
man tar
man rsync
man cron

For data, use rdiff-backup.  It's excellent for backing up huge quantities of
data - we hold ~1.5TB on rdiff-backup.  Increments are very space efficient,
and recovery is easy.

If you have a lot of machines, use backuppc (backuppc.sf.net) for OS and
application backup.  For data continue with rdiff-backup.

Note, both backup apps work best with HDDs and not tape.

Adyar depot, for now. Any change in this will be promptly 
inimated.

What about the ILUGC volunteers for the training session for
students on 11th march. If we train them one week ahead of
the event, it will be of great use on the day of the event.
Volunteers who have already confirmed about your avaliablity
on 18th LDD please reply about your presence on 11th
training session.

Why don't you remove the "tail -n 1" and inspect which directory is
consuming the disk space?

You can try running du -hs $HOME/*. Alternatively check if you have
any hidden files/directories that is consuming the disk space.

see if there are any hidden files.. else use `lsof | grep deleted` to
see if there is any processes holding a deleted file in
/home/username... kill that process then.. otherwise, I would suspect
file system corruption... fsck is your friend...

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0603091103550.9666-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

Hi All,

Two days back, suddenly the Ethernet RTL 8139 card stops working and
RX errors are keep on increasing. This is with Kernel 2.6x. When I
booted with 2.4x, I got "Too much work at interrupt" error message
continuously in my console. I replace the network card (same RTL) and
cable with new one.  But Result is same.

Both kernel uses 8139too module. Any tips to solve this problem ??

Bye :)

What make is it? I had a lot of problems with the Zebronics one - turns out 
that they replaced the VID/PID of the card with some crazy values.

might indicate that there is too much broadcast traffic on the network
too I believe. Seen these problems on firewalls at IIT.

Run tcpdump and take a look.

This problem has been reported by many with Realtek
card using the 8139too driver.

Lot of packets get queued without being serviced in
time.

Yep, my mistake. Sorry for misleading the OP. The reason for reserving
one disk is to keep that disk as spare; since in RAID5, the loss of
TWO disks in a RAID5 array leads to complete data loss in the array.

Hi,

I am facing a problem very much specific to Mozilla
Firefox.It works fine it in IE and Netscape.

I am opening a window using 
modalWin=window.open(String(sURL),"WindowPopUp",sWinFeat).But
am unable to close the window using
window.close().Also, the pop-up shud disable the
access to the parent window. 

If anyone has faced such a problem and has worked on
similar lines, kindly do let me know of the solution
ASAP.


Thanks

Volunteers are get trained by participating/attending the LDDs,
Meeting Talks etc.. Volunteers needs confidence and basic knowledge
about one only tool ;)

I misunderstood your Q. Ignore my prv reply. This training session is
NOT for ILUGC Volunteers. It is for college students volunteers. They
will join with us during the LDD to reduce our load.

And this training will help us to know place and few people in
college. So that, we can handle the LDD more efficiently.

Hello members

Im a student who has installed linux, & used it only for C/C++. After a year
i found a driver for my modem.Now can u plz tell me instructions to install
the driver.I read readme, but couldnt figure out anything out of it. Here
are the contents below the mail.Plz tell me wat is use of make & install,the
difference & exact steps i can follow so that i install & switch to linux
once for all(One reason i was using windows till now)

Thanks a ton

Smart Link Soft Modem for Linux
-------------------------------


Introduction
============

This is Smart Link Soft Modem for Linux version 2.9. It provides
full-featured 56K Voice Fax Modem.
This is implemented as generic application (slmodemd) and set of
hardware specific kernel-space drivers (slamr, slusb).
ALSA modem drivers may be used instead of proprietary ones (see ALSA mode).

Features
========

Modem: V.92, V.90, V.34, V.32bis, V.32, V.23, V.22, V.21, Bell 103/212.
Flow control: V.42.
Compression: V.44, V.42bis.
Fax: Class 1.
Voice: V253 like modem.
Multiple modems are supported.


Supported Hardware
==================

HAMR5600 based AMR/CNR/MDC/ACR modem cards on the following Southbridge
chips:
- Intel ICH0,ICH2, ICH3, ICH4
- Via 686A, 686B, 8231, 8233
- SiS 630
- ALI 1535.
SmartPCI56/561/562/563 based PCI modem cards.
SmartUSB56 based USB modem.



Requirements
============

CPU: Intel Pentium II, Celron. AMD K6, Cyrix 500MHz or higher.
Memory: 64MB.

OS: Linux 2.4. You need the kernel header files at least (or full kernel
               source tree) installed and configured.
    Linux 2.6. You need the full kernel source tree installed and
configured.

Note: Most Linux Distributions have 'ready to use' kernel source package -
      be sure that this is installed.


Installation
============

1. Unpack tar.gz package file:

    $ gzip -dc slmodem-2.9.X.tar.gz | tar xf -

2. 'cd' to package directory:

    $ cd slmodem-2.9.X

3. Review and edit 'Makefile' (if need):

   In many cases you will need to correct path to your local kernel
   source tree:

        KERNEL_DIR=/path/to/linux

   Default KERNEL_DIR is '/lib/modules/<kerne-version>/build'. Many Linux
   Distributions use directory '/usr/src/linux-<version>' also.

   Note: If you are using Linux kernel 2.4, only header files should be
         available for build in $(KERNEL_DIR)/include

   Another way to pass right value KERNEL_DIR is to use command line
   parameter while running 'make':

        $ make KERNEL_DIR=/path/to/linux ...

4. Run 'make' command to compile package:

    $ make

5. Install. As 'root' user run:

    # make install

   It will install:

   - application 'slmodemd' under '/usr/sbin' directory

   - hardware specific drivers (kernel modules) 'slamr' and 'slusb'
     under conventional kernel modules directory

   - character device nodes '/dev/slamr0-3' with major number 212
     (for pci modems) and '/dev/slusb0-3' with major number 213
     (for usb modems).

   - config modules for autoloading (by editing file '/etc/modules.conf')
     (only with 2.4 kernels)

6. Config modem country.

   Use AT+GCI=<T.35 country code> command to setup country.

   Also you can setup default modem country by passing command line
   parameter '--country=MY_COUNTRY' to program 'slmodemd'.

   See output of 'slmodemd --countrylist' for a list of supported
   country names and T.35 country codes (see also 'slmodemd --help').

   Note: Command ATI7 shows currently installed country setting.

8. Uninstallation.

   In package directory just type:

    # make uninstall


Getting Started
===============

After successful installation and configuration:

1. Load modem driver.

   Load your modem hardware specific kernel module:

    # modprobe slamr

   if you are using AMR/CNR/PCI modem, or

    # modprobe slusb

   if you are using SmartUSB56 Modem.

   Note: this will be done automatically when modules were
         configured for 'loading on demand'

   Note: this is safe to load both 'alamr' and 'slusb' modules.

2. Run soft modem application.

       # /usr/sbin/slmodemd [options] <device_name>

   Where device name is appropriate device node for your modem
   (look at output of 'dmesg' command).
   Run '/usr/sbin/slmodemd --help' for details.

   Examples:

       # /usr/sbin/slmodemd --country=USA /dev/slamr0

   , or for SmartUSB56 Modems:

       # /usr/sbin/slmodemd --country=ITALY /dev/slusb0

3. Using the modem.

   When 'slmodemd' is running this creates PTY (pseudo-terminal) to
   emulate modem port device, also this creates symbolic link
   like '/dev/ttySL0' (shown at startup).

   Config your application to use this link '/dev/ttySL0' (or PTY node
   itself) as modem port.

   Note: Some application want 'to know' that they are working with
         pseudo-terminal and may require additional configurations.

   Known application notes:

   - 'wvdial' requires option 'Carrier Check = no' in config file

   - some versions of 'kppp' may not work properly with devices named
     like '/dev/ttySL0'. To workaround this you may create symbolic link
     '/dev/modem' ( # ln -s /dev/ttySL0 /dev/modem ) and use this link
     as modem device with 'kppp'

4. Startup automation.

    There are examples of startup scripts in 'scripts' directory.


ALSA mode
=========

ALSA has the built-in modem drivers included in 'alsa-driver' >= 1.0.2
and in Linux kernel >= 2.6.5. Currently there is 'intel8x0m' (snd-intel8x0m)
modem driver, which supports ICH based AC97 modems (MC97).

1. Configure your kernel and enable ALSA and ICH based modem support
   ( 'Device Drivers' -> 'Sound' -> 'Advanced Linux Sound Architecture' ->
     'PCI devices' -> 'Intel i8x0/MX440; AMD768/8111 modems' ) .

2. Build and install kernel and modules as usual (make , make
modules_install,
   etc.). ICH modem driver modem module name is 'snd-intel8x0m'
  (if was configured as module).

3. Build application 'slmodemd' with ALSA support. For this in
   slmodem-2.9.x dir:

      $ cd modem
      $ make SUPPORT_ALSA=1

   This will build 'slmodemd' with ALSA support. If compilation is failed
   review Makefile (near ALSA_SUPPORT condition) and define right library
   and/or CFLAGS

4. Use option '--alsa' when running 'slmodemd' and ALSA conventional
   device name ('hw:0' or 'hw:1' for instance). If modem support in
   the kernel was enabled as module module 'snd-intel8x0m' should be loaded.
   When using ALSA modem driver you don't need to load other modules
('slamr').


Troubleshooting
===============

If you get an error message during installation/configuration or loading
the modules try to see it in FAQ file.

Please report the problem to your modem provider or to us
(linux-support@smlink.com).


Feedback
========

Please send any feedbacks to Smart Link. See the Smart Link
web site for contact information (www.smlink.com) or to
linux-support@smlink.com.

The details you attached below this mail explains everything in detail.
MAKE -> Compiles the package
make install -> Installs the package.

I still dont understand how more neatly would you need the steps other than 
the one entereed by u!
If you still have some specific doubts put them on the list.

That makes things clear for me abt hardware raid :) Thanks.

As the System is 2 processor based, my vendor offers me 1yr valid RHEL AS edition as OS with 2 CPU centric license. Is the edition ur refering to diferent from this ? or can i opt for 5 yr based licensing. i havent seen any 2 CPU based licenses on redhat.com.

Let us get the terminology clear. The software of RHEL is Free
Software. There is no licensing of that software involved here. You
are paying for support for that software from Redhat. What your vendor
is offering you is this support for one year. It is the same thing
whether you buy from vendor or from Redhat's website, and the cost is
cumulative when you buy for many years together (I think). The support
is per computer - not based on number of CPUs. Secondly, you can
upgrade from RHEL4 to RHEL5 as and when it comes out and still
continue to use the same support subscription.

Hi,
I have downloaded a vanilla kernel and applied ck patches to it..
after everything is done, i have make reiserfs in file system as module as
well as builtin, (both) but when i am trying to boot with this new kernel
its giving kernel panic unable to load from /dev/hda3...
I did initrd by using mkinitrd...
in both cases (i.e making reiserfs as module and reiserfs built into kernel)
i made initrd to have reiserfs module and without module respectively..


But still I am getting errors.... udev is also present in initrd image...
is there anything i am missing? either in the kernel or in initrd??

I have seen sites like this which work only for IE and nothing else...
all we can  do is mail the site designer about the issue so that we can have
a free will world in future.

All packets that arrive on a NIC can be captured using
tcpdump or ethereal.

I had upgraded my Mozilla Firefox from 1.5 to 1.5.0.1
and lost all the engines that i had added previously. 

Though i did install those engines again, but just
thought to convey this to you all and find out if
there is any fix for this?

How to capture TCP/IP Packets!!!! 

Hi, 

i m Ravi, who joind this grp recently, and im new to Linux.
Inorder to capture the packets, u may use Ethreal , but the 
problem is that , it can capture only outgoing packets. The 
Incomin packets r nothin but the ack for the outgoin packets. 
I used Ethreal , and this is wat my observation is.

Ravi.

How did you upgrade?
Can you check whether you have the *.src under
$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/<your-profile-dir>/searchplugins?

Did you create a new profile for this?  If so, you can copy the
searchplugins from your previous profile directory.

Message-ID: <1cc2ae10603100014u1e80c40bp2e1222df1c4f438b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
        I have setup MySQL replication for only one database

/etc/my.cnf (master server)
           binlog-do-db=knowledgebase

/etc/my.cnf (slave server)
          replicate-do-db=knowledgebase

I am able to replicate the changes from master to slave, if my
application uses "use <dbname>" and then insert/delete/update
statements.

But if I used insert/delete/update statements directly (ie) "delete
from dbname.tablename;" (without "use" statement), the changes are not
replicating and also it is not logged in binlog file.

In MySQL site also they specified the problem

Ref: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/replication-problems.html

But how to solve this. Any solutions.

MySQL version: 3.23.58 in both servers

TIA

You're right.  I'm sorry.  Was just being flippant.  No excuse though.

Dear Linux Team,

I have just bought the USB Complete II Edition book at a near by store.
In the near by market, I did not find the USB Complete III Edition book.

Can someone please suggest me what is the difference between these?
Can I safely follow the USB Complete II Edition?

Subject: [Ilugc] Query regarding the scheduler in Linux
Message-ID: <44117709.2050205@gmail.com>


Greetings!

I had this query which i asked on #linux-india (irc.freenode.net) I have
posted the log on http://prash.be/files/irc.log , but I am still unclear
on this. Could someone help me clear this up?

The CPU can run only 1 process at a time.
The Kernel is not a process.
On booting, the bootloader loads the kernel image into the memory and
give it the CPU control. This in turn starts the swapper process and the
subsequent processes. Now from what i understand from the conversation I
had on the irc channel is that at each context switch the scheduler
(which is part of the kernel) will generate a software interrupt.

My question is that when a process (say A) is in running state then the
scheduler will not have the CPU control to generate the software
interrupt. So how does context switching take place?

Thank You,

Do you see any Javascript error?  I see no problem with window.close()
not working unless its trying to close the window that was opened by
your script.

Aanjahn,
Think he was asking " 2. 'cd' to package directory: " :: where is the
package directory ? is it usr/lib/modules or something like tht where
the drivers exist ?? He jus wants to know where he needs to put up his
driver. And if am right, he needn't hv pu the entire readme help page

I replicate all DBs in MySQL 4.0.24 (Debian Sarge) without any woes.

MySQL 3.x is old.  Any chance of upgrading?

Hi All,

FYI...

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hi,

a fixed version of the BLACKSAND ISO is released , providing fixes in
the installer as well as minor configuration changes in the Yoper
system.

It can be downloaded at the known places :

ftp://ftp.yoper.com/pub/yoper/devel/YOPER-2.91-BLACKSAND.iso
ftp://development.yoper.com/yoper/devel/YOPER-2.91-BLACKSAND.iso

on both machines the rsync's are up, too in case you want to use rsync
to update your mirror.


Still considered to be broken is:

- reiserfs completely ( it works on some machines and on some not)
- lilo / bootloader installation + reiser4 crashes
- bootloader installation overwrites existing bootloader and does not
add existing operating systems


Thanks to any organization mirroring and therefore supporting Yoper.

regards

You can go for packet sniffers like Tcpdump or

Hi all!  
  I had installed FC3 in my system. Post installation was not complete. Because,  FC3 does not detects my monitor and it says: Unknown Monitor. 
   
  I edited inittab and changed the runlevel to 1. It boots without any error for this run level. Then, when I am giving startx command, it startx KDE.  GUI comes up and then MY SYSTEM JUST HANGS. Key board is not functioning.  
   
  I even tried Xorg --configure but it does not solves the problem. 
  I have the same problem with Slackware, Knoppix and Debian. 
   
  FYI:  I have Pentium 3 machine with PHILLIPS monitor. 
  Please provide me the solution to configure the GUI properly. 
   
  Thanks in advance.

First thing to do is to try with FC4 and see if it detects the monitor.

I guess you mean runlevel 3 boots fine not runlevel 1.
Do you see any errors (indicated by EE) / warnings (indicated by WW)
in Xorg log?  Typically the log is found under /var/log/Xorg.0.log.

Its called "re-installing the bootloader" grub/lilo to
the MBR.

Some useful pointers:

http://www.sorgonet.com/linux/grubrestore/

http://fedoranews.org/contributors/bob_kashani/grub/

Probably FC3 doesn't have the driver for your display
or your X is not configured. You can reconfigure your
X setting by running either xorgconfig (or xorgcfg -
GUI based) if using Xorg, or using xf86config (or
xf86cfg - GUI based) if using XFree86 after you login
to the console.

Not sure what the FC3 specific command for
reconfiguring X is. The above are generic commands for
X server re-configuration.

When you run the above commands, your configuration
will be saved in the configuration files
/etc/X11/xorg.conf or /etc/X11/X86Config respectively.


HTH,

Greetings!

* The final day of "Bharatham 2006" on Saturday March
12, 2006 at Federal Institute of Science and
Technology, Angamaly, Kochi, Kerala was cancelled due
to a fatal accident, the previous night, to students
from a nearby college. After the cultural festival on
Friday night, the students had left in their car at
around 2230. They didn't have control of the car at
one turning near a small bridge, skidded across, and
drowned in the river. The doors were locked and had
got jammed. Out of five students, only one managed to
escape. A tragedy to all students, faculty, friends in
and around Angamaly.

* Since I had come all the way, they just wanted me to
conduct an informal session for few minutes to the
faculty and few students who were there. I spoke on
free software and GNU/Linux. As a mark of respect to
the loss of life, I didn't take any photographs.

* I spent the remaining time with the students there,
and got to know more about free software activities in
Kerala, right from Calicut, to Palghat, Trichur,
Angamaly, Kochin, Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram.

* Pramode (http://pramode.net/) is the inspiration in
Government Engineering College, Trichur and other
places in Kerala.

* Space Kerala promote free software and do good work
in promoting the same to schools, colleges, NGOs
throughout Kerala: http://space-kerala.org/.

* Thanks to Sumod (final year, ICE) for coordinating
with me for the past three weeks, and for the
hospitality offered.

We want to collaborate more with our folks in Kerala
and will organize more workshops in future. 

Regards,

SK

Hi ! 
   
  I have a couple of problems with my Fc4 installation. 
  1) It does not detects my mouse.
  2) I am unable to access my USB flash drive . 
  I explored /dev/ directory but I am unable to find a corresponding device.
  But, when I use hardware browser, it shows a USB device and the driver. It does not gives any mount point. 
       To solve this problem, I just plugged my USB drive and  I watched /var/log/messages.  
  I got the following messages:
   
  kernel: new high speed USB drive using ehci_hcd and address 4.
  kernel: SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices.
  kernel: Vendor: Jet Flash  Rev: 8.07 Type: Direct Access Size: 256 MB

  ***** I think the last message is important. I guess it automatically resets the device.
   
  NOTE:  
  Now, I installed FC4 and it detects my monitor and GUI works perperly. Thanks 
   
  Thanks in advance.

If using a recent distro with 2.6 kernel, unless the
device is properly detected udevd (running on your
system) will not create the /dev entries for your
drive.

It doesn't detect your partition table properly. What
filesystem are you using on the drive? Probably the
filesystem support is not available in the in-built
kernel you are using.

Host controller will always send a reset to the
device.

Hi,

This is in regard to the LDD at SSN, this coming
Saturday, March 18, 2006.

I would like to have a 45 minute session on "Careers
with GNU/Linux" before we begin with the introduction
of free/open source software.

I feel it will be apt because the so-called
"engineering students" usually ask about job
opportunities, skills required etc., and it would be
useful to begin with it before proceeding with the
demo of available free softwares.

Can we begin with this?

The best thing to do would be to use the 2.6 kernel. When you boot
from the CD, type linux26 at the "boot:" prompt. That would be your
best bet.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] Chennai.rb needs a meeting place
Message-ID: <44151879.8060007@gmx.net>

Hi All,

        Chennai.rb has benefited a lot from ILUGC, in building up its 
initial members from this list. I am very grateful for that, and hope 
many more ILUGC members discover the joy that is Ruby. I hope you guys 
wouldn't mind one more request.

        Ma Foi Academy has been very generous with its premises so far, 
giving us free access for both GLV and Chennai.rb sessions (thanks to 
Asokan). Alas, things have changed, and all good things must come to an 
end. Academy has indicated its inability to let us use the premises 
anymore, so I have to scout for a new host now. Though I initially 
thought of IITM, I would prefer a more central location so that it is 
accessible to all of us.

        I would love it if any software companies, colleges come forward 
to provide a meeting place for the Chennai Ruby Brigade. What we would 
need is simple: a hall with 20-30 seater capacity with projector so that 
the speaker can hook up his laptop to, and internet access would be just 
great, if it can be arranged.  Please speak to your bosses, if they're 
the progressive types ;-)

        So what do you get in return? Free knowledge. You get to hear 
cutting-edge topics on Ruby, Ruby on Rails, how to develop, run and host 
it, new stuff, etc. There are plans to invite speakers from other Ruby 
user groups across the country (I have at least one speaker lined up).

        Not just Ruby, we have plans to discuss up and coming languages 
like Haskell, Lua, Io, etc. Suffice it to say that you will get to hear 
some very interesting technical topics for no cost at all. Plus, you 
will always have the community's good will. I hope that didn't sound 
like some elevator pitch, I really believe that you will get a great 
benefit out of letting us use your premises. In case you are interested, 
please write back to me (on the 'from' id of this mail).

TIA,
Vamsee.

Presently we have 2 options IITM and AU-KBC, MIT. Few others may be
ready to give the place. But if they didn't understand our motive then
it may be difficult to move with them. It is my experience.

There was one gentleman from a company in
Nungambakkam, Chennai who was interested in offering
their place for our GLV/ILUGC/Chennai.rb meets. I
forgot the name.

I did ask him to attend one of our meets to discuss
the same with the volunteers. Not sure if he attended
our monthly meet on Saturday, March 11, 2006.

Sir, please reply to us in the mailing list so
everyone can share their inputs/feedback.

That's the problem with closed source proprietary
formats. They are not open standards and they won't
support working on different environments.

You can try it with wine, but, I'd definitely
recommend moving to dia or kivio:

Dia:

Kivio:

You probably can't. You can try the Visio viewer inside Wine or
something, but I'd recommend you stay within MS fiefdom if Visio is a
requirement.

I too faced such problem (Now I don't use Visio, MS-Word is enough, sinc
Word is openoffice compatible). I saved old visio files as image format
(svg, jpg, gif, bmp..) in visio. Then imported this in to openoffice
drawing.

Nice to see BarCamp headed to Chennai.

I'll be there.Looks like this is on second Saturday of the month.Any
chance of ILUGC collborating with BarCamp ?

BarCamp also concentrates on FOSS, so it's not OT.

I'll try and get a few people from my workplace and try to pitch in
with a few talks.

Anyplace where BarCamp discussion is being done apart from the wiki ?
mailing-list ?

I have a laptop but no wifi. Is that a must? Even otherwise, how much
of a handicap will it be?

:) Nope.
When they mean Wi-Fi they mean the place has to support WiFi.
Wi-Fi is required for people who are interested in
"live-blogging",where people blog about an event as and how it
unfolds[1].

I'm not sure if ethernet will be available there.You can always bring
over your laptop and we can work things out. ;)

I hope you realize that it is possible to restrict your javascript
from doing all that in Firefox (and I think in 1.5, these restrictions
are on by default). Look at Tools->Options->Content->Enable
Javascript->Advanced.

Wierd! didnt even touch my code, but restarted my
machine and the script started working in NS,IE and
FF.

However, in IE - another window(browser) opens on its
own and closes when the user clicks on 'Close' link.

<a href="javascript:window.close();"
onClick="javascript:window.close();return true;"
 onKeypress="javascript:window.close();return
true;"">Close</a>

What am i doing wrong!!

Hi,

I am one among on the organisers of BarCampChennai. Wi-Fi is available for
people who wants to live blog about the event. That's all, it is not
mandatory for everyone to blog. In addition, i would ideally like to look at
the state of language computing in the Web 2.0 scenario. If some of you guys
can make a presentation on that, that will be wonderful to go with. I am
making a presentation on Web 2.0 and demo of TracBac<http://www.tracbac.com>

This is developed with some of the well known open source databases
available with PHP & Flash. I expect the IIUGC community to sphearhead open
source, linux and the next generation of web in this event. This is a great
place to evangelise and also to network with your peers. Don't miss out this
opportunity

Hi all,

Has any one succeeded in connecting Gnomemeeting 1.0.2 with a MS Net
meeting? I am able to get the audio alone from a MS NetMeeting. But both
video and audio are not receivable by the receiver. I am using BSNL Broad
band using a router, and the IP is natted. I have given the nat address in
Nat address. I am able to hear the other person's voice. My GnomeMeeting
claims that voice and video are getting transmitted, but they are not
received at the othe end. does any one have any pointers???

Config:
Mandrake 10.1/Gnome Meeting 1.0.2

with regards,
Natarajan.

2) Give the details what u want..


If u want to listen,see the all types of moive..my suggestion is to go 
for mplayer.
Download the palyer and windows codec(better to download all codec).
install it.

for second question, which platform u want to build?

if it is gnome application then u should lern GTK+
if it is KDE application then u have to go for kdevelop eith KDE API.

Nice to go for Qt also..(u can build multiplatform application)
Give specific ......what type of application,targeted platform

You can notice there are no speakers for topics

When we are around, we can always take care of the
other sessions even if you don't get volunteers.

I can handle "Installation". I can also do two
sessions:

* "Free Software for Engineers" (overview)
* "GNU/Linux Desktop" (demo)

and any others on demand if there are time slots
available.

if u have "xine" [http://xinehq.de/index.php/releases]
 download  codec from mplayer site
http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/essential-20050412.tar.bz2

Place all the codec into /usr/lib/win32[depends on ur

Message-ID: <a8f990120603140814y608c766cq6038a29ff7ec26e4@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,
        The Ekiga VoIP client has been released - this is the
successor to GnomeMeeting, by the same team:

http://linux.slashdot.org/linux/06/03/13/1658206.shtml

They're also providing free SIP accounts at ekiga.net, so go
there and pick up your account now. Mine is:

sip:siva@ekiga.net

However, I haven't got my box fully configured to make calls
yet - in principle, it should be possible to do all 3 of:

1) PC-to-PC SIP calls;
2) PC-to-phone SIP calls;
3) phone-to-PC SIP calls.

and in all cases it should work for international calls as well.
It also has support for associating your SIP account with
a real phone number, so you can give people only your real
phone number, and receive SIP calls at the PC.

I'm configuring a machine for this now, but it may take a
while to get it going. I've resolved all the dependencies,
but the Ekiga build itself breaks in the final stages due
to some issue with scrollkeeper - I'll give the details
in another posting. If anybody beats me to it, please
post a mini-HOWTO.

Hi All,

 My friend owns a textile company and he likes to set up a website for his
firm. Following is what he wants,

   - He requires the website to be in his company name -
   www.companyname.com.
   - business email accounts for his employees - roughly 30.
   - The number of pages that will be hosted will be a maximum of 25. The
   hosting space required will be around 500 MB in case if it requires some CMS
   systems.

 I am looking for a best solution which can provide me all of these at
minimal cost. Plain HTML support is sufficient at this moment. I was looking
at yahoo small business web hosting started pack. But it was much more than
what I want. It will be great if someone can suggest a better solution that
you know.

Thanks,

Would a build system like jhbuild or garnome help ?
GNOME 2.14 ships with Ekiga(I guess), so the dependency part will be
taken care of by the build system.

just my 0.02$

Do keep us in the loop.

Hello all,
We are trying to develop a UI for some application. I would like to know
what tool I should use to develop it. We have thought of using GTK. We want
it to look something like thunderbird (I mean the UI). If I am wrong any
where, please correct me.

GTK is written in C. So, if you are comfortable with
C, you can use glade for the UI design.

http://glade.gnome.org/

If you are comfortable with C++ you can try Qt.
KDevelop can be used as an IDE along with Qt designer
for front-end design.

http://women.kde.org/articles/tutorials/kdevelop3/

You can also use Motif libraries and Lesstif for GUI
development on GNU/Linux.

http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif/

http://www.lesstif.org/

Have fun,

SK

If it is an application that will be accessed over the network then I would
suggest a browser based AJAX client. It can do whatever a thick client can
do but with none of the hassles of deployment. And if at all you want to
deploy the same application over a mobile device (in these times of 3G and
mobile WiFi this will become a necessity soon) then it is only an xslt away.

Hi bharath,
 i think u got some idea from previous replay. Well i had a same problem 
also. I started with GTK+ but later i switched to Qt for fast 
development and multiplatform support.

This feasibilty study showed me that if u are strong in c and love to 
code extensively then go for GTK+.If u are realy building mail client 
based on gtk+ then u can download lightweight mailclient  sylpheed... 
(http://sylpheed.good-day.net/en/) see the source code..it is based on GTK+

but u have to have proper understanding of large C code. It is time being.

If u want to do with small time , then my recomendation is for Qt( 
support muliplatform(win,linux,mac,etc..)less coding,C++ based,easy to 
learn). It comes with very good Documentation from Trolltech. It will 
help u too much.

I would not suggest motif( it is old and not so look and feel)..

"If it is an application that will be accessed over the network then I would suggest a browser based AJAX client."...

i would suggest to look this link

Have a fun!

Message-ID: <20060315080756.15212.qmail@web8705.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hi Linuxers,

I have been using Linux for some time, but am
disappointed with it's support for video drivers. I
have a S3 Unichrome onboard card (VIA KM400 AMD Athlon
2400+) which does not allow me to go beyond 1024x748.
I've tried the drivers from openchrome.org but in no
avail. Eventually, I'm planning to get a stand-alone
card that has basic 3D performance too. I play Quake
3, HalfLife on Windows and I guess, with the proper
drivers, I can be able to do the same from Linux as
well... Most of the distros (I use Ubuntu now) seem to
provide support for Nividia and hence would like to
know what is the basic card that I can get (<Rs.3000)
with decent 3D performance. There seems to be so many
varieties availabe in the market... So could any one
of you suggest a good card that fits my requirements?

Thanks and regards,
Shoban Jayaraj

Hi Toufeeq,
                 The build breakage seems to be Fedora-specific, and
related to issues with libtool and libxml2 - I'm planning to bypass
some of the issues with pre-built binary RPMs and then attempt
to build it again. Part of the problems are due to my configuration -
it started as a RH 7.3 box and has been upgraded over the years
to somewhere between FC3 and FC4.

YMMV, but the following set of packages had to be rebuilt and
installed on my box to resolve dependencies:

Pyrex-0.9.3-2
cups-1.1.23-15.4
libgnomecups-0.2.0-2
dbus-0.33-3.fc4.1
bind-9.3.1-14_FC4
(all of the above required for => openldap-2.2.29-1)
gnome-doc-utils-0.5.7-1   (from fedora development)
pwlib-1.10.0-1 (from ekiga.net)
opal-2.2.0-1 (from ekiga.net)
libavc1394-0.4.1-8 (from FC4)

At this point, all the dependencies are resolved, and I can
*almost* build ekiga-2.0.0-1 from SRPM, but the build breaks
near the end with something related to var/lib/scrollkeeper.
I'll look at it later - it appears that ekiga needs to be built
as root, or scrollkeeper needs an update. Attempts to rebuild
more recent versions of scrollkeeper break on lubxml2/libtool
suckage.

Never blame the software, if there isn't proper
support from vendors in releasing their hardware
details - datasheets.

You cannot write device drivers for a hardware which
you don't know about.

What do you mean by "no avail"? Any error/output
messages? Can you start X?

Message-ID: <a1da1e5e0603150133x4564defboed90fd6fc9384fed@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have installed Ekiga 2.0.1 successfully in Ubuntu Breezy (5.10). I built
it from source downloaded from http://ekiga.org. I had to download
avahi-0.6.9 source and installed it as dependency ( I disabled mono and
monodoc while installing avahi since backport is not available for latest
version of monodoc). All other dependencied were met by the ubuntu
repositories.

But the important point is I don't have anybody else to communicate with me
through this tool... I don't have mic and camera.... wait..wait.. i can
understand your point that what is the use of installing ekiga? Just for
Fun!!!!!!!!!!! Any way here is my user id sip:swamytk@ekiga.net.

I resolved it by building ekiga-2.0.0-1 as root (I dislike doing
this, but it was the easiest way out), with scrollkeeper-0.3.14-5.
It built and installed cleanly, and I was able to start it and
go through the initial configuration. Most of what I said
earlier should apply to FC3/FC4 boxes. I'll probably dedicate
an old P2/P3 box with a soundcard running a minimal FC4
installation as an Ekiga SIP phone, later - I've got a HP
Vectra that fits the bill perfectly.

Some interesting combinations of Asterix servers with Ekiga
clients should be possible - budding entrepreneurs who want
to get into VoIP should take note. This is a highly disruptive
technology, if coupled with Mesh Wi-Fi networks.

afaik ekiga is in dapper repositories..so that shouldnt be a problem,
especially with regards to dependancies..(yay...apt-get..)

Yes. I suggest XUL based UI from Mozilla foundation. Its platform
independent. Thunderbird UI is built on XUL.

ATI cards(some of them) come with open drivers(==better), if you go
with Nvidia you will have to use their binary drivers or use the
crappy driver that ships with the linux kernel.

Yes, that's how it looks.
The new tutorial[1] looks much better(organized), IMHO.

If ease of deployment is a concern then browser based applications are the
best.

Found a bug in the UI logic? Just fix it in your server. No sweat. You dont
have to contact every user of your app and tell him to upgrade his version.

Introduced a new feature which you find cool? Just mark it 'New' and it is
delivered soon as a user logs in. No download-patch cycle for the user - to
try a feature she might find dumb and be pissed off for having gone to all
the trouble!

All this plus the access from the mobile phone - india's PC!

Fine I agree to this, btw comparing XUL with a web based application
is like comparing Apples to Oranges, since XUL works only with Mozilla
based browsers.

So, btw, aren't you upgrading your browser?

It is the user's responsibility to check out the latest version of the
product and upgrade frequently, and also the company's responsibility
to put up a link in their web site about a new release.

This is applicable to all applications that runs on your desktop.  And
can I say that the user is not forced to upgrade ;-)

Heard about Minomo?

BTW I'm not comparing XUL with HTML/anything here, just answering your

This should not happen in first place if your code is tested and your
QA has given a test cycle pass.

Developing a web-based application doesn't mean to write horrible
untested code so that it can be reverted any time.

Sorry. Thought I'll add some more (borrowed) insights:

When you give a browser based UI you are delivering a service - which is
what the client is actually interested in. In thick clients the stress,
unwittingly, seems to be on the software. The service seems to follow it in
importance!

You can deliver a new feature everyday and have a high chance of your users
trying many of them. Like google does. In thickclient deployment mode you
can realistically give a bunched up set of features (actually _software_
that has some features), maybe once a month. And many of those features will
go undiscovered. Like what Microsoft does.

Am saying, "Forget apples... eat oranges" :-)

So, btw, aren't you upgrading your browser?


 I would. Whether I use this application or not! The bad karma is with the
browser vendor. Not the app/service provider.

Robustness is inversely proportional to 'dependence on user responsibility'

This is applicable to all applications that runs on your desktop.  And

Don't  you want your  app (the _service_ it delivers) to be better than the
others?


Heard about Minomo?

> http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minimo/


Vaguely. Sorry. If I have a browser based app I wouldnt have to worry about
these.


Just my views too. Am in a bit of hurry now. Forgive me if it is offensive!

Hi,
I need to change the receiver window size dynamically i.e.,i need to
advertise a receive window size of zero on all acknowledgments except the
last one..
in the last acknowledgement i advertise the full window size..
in  this way i force the sender to send data in bursts..
However i find that there is no dynamic receive window advertisemenet in
ns..
I have to do everything in a client centered manner..
How do i change the receive window size dynamically??
r there any patches available??
Any alternate methods??

Pls help its urgent..

why not? even the most comprehensive tests could fail to unearth a 
bug which appears in mass usage. Also bug free does not imply

We are not saying there can't be any bugs, but rather about the kind
of notion that people have.  You make a change, there's a new bug now,
revert it back.

Assuming you are developing a desktop application, would you ask your
customer to revert it back?  So, just because I'm developing a web
based application doesn't mean that I should be writing buggy rather
untested code.

Dear Friends,

I have proposed to go for new complete desktop home pc in a few monthis (I
want to retain my good old pc repaired and kept ready for assembly coding
purpose, right now i am using qemu for that purpose. Thanks to Sakthi for
cautioning me not to use laptop for such testing!) .
The usage of new pc will be:
1. Broadband Airtel Internet - Browsing and E-mail (Firefox)
2. Simple Photo editing and album (GIMP/Inkspace/f-spot)
3. MP3/CD/DVD Playing
4. Eye candy desktop (xcomposite)
5. OpenOffice Suite
6. Racing Games
7. Multimedia Educational Softwares for my child
8. Features of Future: TV Tuner with FM, Scanner and Printer

*** I trust linux *** for these functionalities. I want to make complete
Linux Home PC. I hesitate to go for Pentinum 4 since there is much talk
about dual core and 64bit. Please clarify my questions:

What about 64-bit processors/dual-core processors/EM64T? which one I can go
for?
How Linux kernel supports this?
When there is not much 64 bit applications available, will it be worth?
64-bit processors/Dual-Core and Motherboards (Original Intel) available in
Chennai, now?

There are a number of distros that you can use for
64-bit processing.

The following is for laptops, but, will give you an
idea on the distros that are available for 64-bit:

http://tuxmobil.org/cpu_64bit.html

> When there is not much 64 bit applications

Who said so? Most 64-bit distros ship with 64-bit
compiled applications. There are some that are
compiled with 32-bit.

Its just that when you are using 32-bit applications
you are not using the processor to its full, but, it
is always backward compatible.

You would probably find 64-bit useful if you are
running servers, gaming, clusters, rendering
(blender), synthesis (VLSI) etc.

I think Sudharshan was planning to buy and run AMD
64-bit? Not sure.

I never said one is entitled to write 'horrible untested software' when it

one use case was when google had implemented that big brother 
thingie - it was stable and bug free, but bugged the hell out of 
the users and all lovers of freedom. If it had been a gui app, they 
would have had to recall all copies of it - as it was web based, a 
press of a key solved the problem. What they call web2 is changing 
the way software is being developed and deployed.

Due to licensing, the mp3 support is not provided with
the distro. You can install the mp3-plugin and use
xmms to play mp3s.

we had a discussion on IRC, there is open software, open protocols 
and open standards. HTML is an open protocol. M$ has many closed 
protocols and standards that are exposed to developers under NDA. 
So i would say that all open protocols and open standards also more 
or less come under the foss umbrella.

90% of the tools they use are foss, and they have started releasing 
their products as foss also - so they are on *our* side

If anyone of you would like to use my laptop for the

I have already installed apache/php/mysql/squid for

If you need any particular software for demo purposes,

a joke - if one wants to protest against google/yahoo policies in 
china/saudi, the only way to do it effectively is to organise a 
mass boycott of google/yahoo services - you cant use their services 
on one hand and protest their policies at the same time, and the OP 
is using gmail. This means that if our govt asks google for the 
contents of gmail mailboxes and google obliges ...

Dear all, 
 
I know that we are a society which does not mind offering solution without expecing compensation. However, I need help from linux knowledgable persons to help maintain our office systems. 
 
I am an IIT grad  of '74 vintage - who understands kinux but without sufficient time for hands on work of trouble shooting. 
 
We have a main linux server and had installed LTSP using number of PII systems. things were going somewhat smoothly, though not to my expectations. After some of the persons who set these up inititally, we are finding problems in regualr running. 
 
i am willing to reasonably compensate anyone who would be available for trouble shooting. (though not in the scale of IT multinationals)
 
presently our problems is that NFSD (nfs daemon) is not starting - so - samb is running, but not LTSP terminals. 
 
Any takers?
 
I am also willing to provide facilities  for students who wnat to do projects in linux based systems. ( with some guidance from me)

nothing wrong with offering payment for help on this list. Only 
thing is that you should put a proper subject line and put the 
[Commercial] tag in the subject.

Hi Raja,
            Actually, I'm just getting started myself. For PC-to-PC, all you
need
is a SIP client like Ekiga at each end, and account(s) on Ekiga.net. I

I guess you are an experienced linux user..
go the debian way, package management is easy,
else there are certain distros for the 64bit archs.

and of course go in for an nvidia4 based chipset, infact anything
but SiS, (no prizes for guessing what i m havin)...

Oh and be careful about the TV tuner card..

Dear all,
              I have a dual boot system, one being Windows and the other
being Debain( kernel: 2.6.12,  testing).
 Yesterday I ran apt-get upgrade and accidentally pressed yes to whatever
upgrades it showed. (I am normally careful about it, but I accidentally
pressed the enter key).  Now today when I tried to boot my  machine, half
way through the process it said "could not find /dev/hda8,  dropping down to
shell".

         The /dev/hda8 is my root partition. /dev/hda1,5,6,7 being my
windows partitions. Now I want to know what I am supposed to do to overcome
this problem. I know that this problem occurs if you try to upgrade the
kernel which is running at that time, but I am pretty sure that it did not
upgrade my kernel when I ran apt.

cheers,
Naresh.

ILUGC conducts regular talks called GNU/Linux Vidhyashram. so maybe you
could demo OpenMosix at one of the GLV sessions :-)

Mixing 32bit and 64bit apps are handled differently in various distros.
Debian/Ubuntu just don't allow this mixing, so if you are installing the
64 bit version of a distron and a 64 bit version of a particular application
is not available, then you have to setup a minimalistic chroot environment
with the required 32 bit libraries. Gentoo, IRC, handle this in a different
way by placing 64 bit libraries in /lib64/ so that 32bit and 64bit of the same
library can coexist.

As a side note: I just saw a flashy new intel dual core MAC and spell bound
by the awesome desing and specification. There were words around that
the box was able to boot gentoo.

I think he's talking about GNU/Linux based on either SYSV / BSD flavor.

Subject: [Ilugc] Simple linux playlist.
Message-ID: <5580629a0603172314h3a55d599qde51146ff34e6315@mail.gmail.com>

Linux has taught me many lessons. More precisely, its pioneer Linus
Torvalds. One of the lessons is this:

*When you don't have some software or a necessity, dont wait for others to.
do it yourself like Linus did.*


 It may take some time but the satisfaction you get is immense. I wanted a
play list for Realplayer10. But did not find it. I like to put on some 20
songs and then work maths for my exams. ( a habit from the time i was using
Windows. So I had to select each song when the previous was played( I hated
it, it was a hindrance ). I decided to write a play list software and was
pleasantly surprised what a few command and a simple cpp program could do.
True to Linux culture i share my finding for noobs like me.

Most people have all their songs (or most) in a single folder. Do this:

* Open a terminal window and type

*ls folder name > songlist.txt*

* Then open a file called listtoplaylist.cpp and type the following code .

   *#include <string>*

            *#include <fstream>*

            *using namespace std;*

            *int main() {*

            *ifstream in("songlist.txt"); // Open for reading*

            *ofstream out("playlist.sh"); // Open for writing*

            *string s;*

            *while(getline(in, s)) // Discards newline char*

            * out <<"#realplay -q" <<" \'Foldername\'" <<"\'"<<
            s <<"\'" <<"\n"; }*

            */*prints #realplay -q 'Foldername' 'filename' in
            play list.sh*/*

         */*I use ' and ' because the filename and foldername can
         have spaces*/*

* Save it and in the terminal window type

   *g++ -o listtoplaylist listtoplaylist.cpp*


 * This creates a file called playlist.sh . Then create a folder called
Backuplist and copy the file playlist.sh to the folder.


*Then open a file called refresh.sh and in it type:

*rm playlist.sh*

* cp Backuplist/playlist.sh <name_of_folder_of_original_playlist>*


 * Finally create another file in the same folder as the original playlist
called update.sh and then in it type:

   *rm Backuplist/playlist.sh*

   *cp playlist.sh Backuplist*


 Now this is how it works.

Uncomment(remove the #sign ) of all the lines containing songs you want to
play.

Then execute playlist.sh by typing in the terminal* *after navigating to the
folder.

*./playlist.sh*

* *I created the backup file with a reason, You need not take care to put
the # back for every line once the playlist is comleted. You can just type
in the terminal

*./refresh.sh*

But at the same time you can keep the original playlist as it is too by not
refreshing.

 You can also add new songs to the playlist by typing #realplay -q
'<songname with path>' in the original playlist file. Then save the playlist
file. But be sure to do a *./refresh.sh *before adding new names to ensure
that all lines are commented out in the playlist. Then add names and save
it( with # preceding them).

Then type

*./update.sh.*

This will make sure that your backup list is up to date.

Notes:

   1.

         The -q option tells the player to close once playback is
         over. this ensures that the next line in the script,
         playlist.sh, (ie. the next song) will be executed.
         2.

         real player10 can be downloaded from http://www.real.com
         3.

         You can manage stuff using just the playlist.sh file
         alone.But be sure to put the # back in all lines u
         uncommented.
         4.

         I am planning to create a single cpp program that can
         handle all this. but i am searching for a command to execute
a shell command
         inside a cpp program. If you know the command(something like
exec in python)
         tell me.
         5.

         You can also use it with other players by replacing
         "realplay -q"with the shell command for the player with a
relevent option.
         6.

         The single quotes are to make the computer understand it
         is a single file or folder if spaces are there in the file
name. Most of
         mine did.
         7.

         Create your own small codes and share it with the
         community to promote open source software.
         8.

         This may be a childplay for some gurus here. But I am
         doing it for the rest :) .
         9.

         Please send in your feedbacks and whether it works or not.
         It did for me.

Hi



We are trying to set a RHEL  server.

We already have a NT server with lot of users

We want to migrated the username / passwords as it is to the new Linux
server



But Linux is not accepting some of the user passwords.

The minimum password length is set as 6 characters

How to change this to say 4 characters



Lot of googling - still haven't got the detail.


Thank you in advance

If you are on RHEL, you have support from Redhat. Ask them.

Don't. 4 character passwords will be easy to bruteforce.

they are migrating doze guys to linux - i would say, first get them 
onto linux and then raise the password limit and get them to change 
their passwords - never give anyone any room to carp about linux.

B.S. Migration from one system to another is not an excuse for shoddy
security practices.

If they are indeed brute forced, it would give them a reason to say
that "our linux systems got hacked, we are going back to windows",
potentially influencing others' decisions to migate. I'd rather have
these guys continue on windows and getting this bruteforce experience
on that platform.

My hosting folks migrated from one state to another,
and the GLAMP version changed.

I didn't have time to do database format conversions
or learn to use mysql. Sorry, not a database guy. 

So, I reverted back to html. Simple and easy to
maintain.

BSD distros use the BSD Unix kernel. 

They are both different, don't confuse, mix and match
them.

GNU/Linux distros are Red Hat, Fedora Core, Gentoo,
Debian, Ubuntu, Slackware et. al.

BSD distros are FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD.

You can run Gnome on both GNU/Linux and FreeBSD, they
are all application packages ported to these
environments.

Thanks to the Management, SSN College of Engineering,
Dr. Aravindhan (HOD, CSD), Prof. Balasubramanian
(Lecturer, CSD), and to students and faculty/staff of
SSN College of Engineering.

Thanks to Naren who has been coordinating this event
for the past three weeks.

* Vijay Kumar began the day's proceedings with
introduction to free software.

* I then conducted the "Careers with GNU/Linux"
presentation. It can be freely downloaded (under CC

played the the demo video of xgl/opengl.

The audience were from different departments, and we
had good interactive sessions.

SSN folks are very keen on *nix environments, and are
interested in many follow-up sessions.

Suggestions were provided to start a user group within
campus so students can participate.

Thanks to Vijay Kumar, Joe Steeve, Naren, Ashwin,
Sujith for their company and participation. I had a
great time!

It would be easier to use a scripting language for things like this. I 
personally use python for such tasks. Here's a script I wrote to split one 
huge HTML file into several small HTML files, where the each small file is 
delimited by a <h2> tag.

#!/usr/bin/env python

import os,sys

infile=open(sys.argv[1])
outdir=sys.argv[2]+'/'

instream=infile.read()
#os.mkdir(outdir)

filename_template=sys.argv[4]
file_template=open(sys.argv[3]).read()

ins=instream[instream.find("<body>")+6:instream.find("</body>")-1] # Get the 
actual body conten

chapters=dict()

i=0
st=0
end=0
while st <= len(ins):
    end=ins.find('<h1 align="center">')
    st=end
    text='<h1 align="center">'+ins[:end]
    ins=ins[end+len('<h1 align="center">'):]
    title=sys.argv[4]+" Chapter " + str(i)

    filename=filename_template+'-'+str(i)+'.html'
    if(i != 0):
        prev_filename=filename_template+'-'+str(i-1)+'.html'
    else:
        prev_filename=""
    next_filename=filename_template+'-'+str(i+1)+'.html'
    file_out=file_template.replace("$TEXT", text).replace("$TITLE", 
title).replace("$NEXT", next_filename).replace("$PREV", prev_filename)
    path=outdir+'/'+filename
    f=open(path, 'w')
    f.write(file_out)
    chapters[i]=filename
    f.close()
    i+=1

Though, tell me if mailing it messes up the formatting - leading whitespaces 
ARE significant in python

Excuse me, I was mentioning about the flavor of Unix as in BSD/SYSV
not about the kernel.
Slackware used to be a kind of BSD flavor housing the init scripts
under /etc/rc.d unlike the SYSV (/etc/rc?.d) until Slackware 7. 
Slackware 7 and after had SYSV compatibility.

The BSDs don't have runlevels unlike the SYSV based Unices.  SunOS was
a BSD flavor Unix until Sun decided (may be due to marketing strategy
or whatever I don't know) to make Solaris a SYSV like.

I am moving from dialup to broadband. It there any recommended connection

want to download the cds (had bad experiences, purchasing cds). I want an
unlimited broadband connection.I have 3 offers currently.
Reliance: Rs.350-400, flat free package. 74 kbps.
Tata Indicom Rs. 500,unlimited , 64kbps.
Airtel Rs.600, unlimited, 128kbps.
Which do i choose. I have to be cost conscious. I would prefer the reliance
or tata pack. but will there be a better alternative. Please advice.
Recommend Airtel only if there is a real performance boost.

I use Airtel(256kpbs unlimited @ 1000/mo) and the performance/service
is really good

Hmm. I don't know too much about the other service providers. But I can 
heartily recommend the Airtel guys. Looks like it's a bit expensive than 
the others. I have a 999Rs plan @ 256kbps unlimited.

The service is amazing, I got an adsl router which I can connect through 
USB or eth, configuring was all done through the browser, and they'll do 
it for you. So, my Ubuntu-running thinkpad can happily connect to the 
net, the speed is decent, and there was only one occasion when the 
connection went down, and there was actually some technical person on 
the other side when I called them up at 5 am in the morning to lodge my 
complaint. I guess you get what  you pay for.

Ok, at the risk of sounding like some sales guy for Airtel, you also get 
a landline phone with the broadband connection, and you get 5% off the 
combined bill if you have an Airtel postpaid cell connection.

HTH,
Vamsee.

I guess it would help if you could just write a HOWTO setup the connection.
Also other service users can also write their HOWTOs in the wiki.

To a certain extent Gentoo can be regarded sort of BSD flavor, because
of its portage (like ports) system.

Otherwise, all the GNU/Linux distros are SYSV types (they have various
runlevels).

Go for one of the *BSDs if you want to tryout a true BSD type system.

Hi all,

Whenever i insert my USB Thumbdrive, Kernel detects,loads the module and i
find that the thumbdrive is created automatically at /dev/sda, but never
informs about it to me. I check whether it is mounted or not through tail
dmesg. Now i want to track this, create /dev/usb instead of /dev/sda, mount
it at my location(say /media/usb) and inform the user that it has mounted,
by running a program.

To make this happen, should i write a udev rule or handle through Hotplug?.

I would also be happy to know what happens when an USB Thumbdrive gets
plugged in?..how does the flow be and reach hotplug and udev from kernel
loading the module.

Note : I am using hotplug-perl and udev in my distribution

Thanks for the help.

 Hi,
I have added a new field to the tcp header which im using in the receiver(
tcp-sink.cc) to dynamically advertise receiver window size..
i advertise 0 window size on all acknowledgements except the last one where
i advertise full window size(20)..
this value is set in the new field and sent along with the acknowledgement..
 at the sender(tcp.cc) i have received the acknowledgemnet..
i read the value of this field ..
i want to equate this value to the sender window which will send packets
according to the advertised value..
where do i find this??
which variable do i have to equate it to??
which variable is responsible for sending packets according to the receiver
window size??

Pls help its urgent..

Thanks,
 Amrutha.

Dear all

On 18th March me,thyagu and baskar went to Arunai Engg college,
Tiruvannamalai.

There were about 50 student volunteers for the forthcoming linux
expo. In the forenoon session we exposed them to FOSS philosophy,
installation of Linux and some gui tools like Openoffice. In the
after noon we announced the list of topics under which the expo will
be held and asked students to volunteer. After this we went to lab,
interacted with each set of 3-4 volunteers. Explained them the basics
of those topics, guided them where the documents are available to
study.

>From the interaction, I feel we will be having highly enthusiastic
set of  student volunteers. They are willing to learn a lot. It is
now ILUGC responsibility to utilise this students pool.

The proposed stalls with volunteers so far opted are given below. We
need many more volunteers for the event. Kindly volunteer and ilugc
manaththa kappathunga.

The college admin and faculty are very good and take care of us well.
They look forward for a successful show. Atleast 10 colleges around

about 3000 visitors this time.

Message-ID: <BAY110-F22E966DA4C2101B6D9F5749BDB0@phx.gbl>

Hello All,

The FOSS Meet at NIT Calicut was a grand success. Thanks to Praveen, 
Amarjit.

The event started with a usual inaugration followed by Lectures on various 
topics like Gentoo, Ruby, FOSS Foundry, VLSI/EDA Tools, Embedded Linux, FOSS 
Movement, Network Security..

There were workshops on Live CD and Debian and an Orchestra in the Night.

We had a nice time meeting a lot of people. I must say that the students 
were really enthusiastic and were eager to know more.. I appreciate their 
curiosity to learn..
Also it was a place where we could [FOSS guys] meet up and have loads of fun 
for two days.

Am sure more such events would definitely make all our DREAMS come true.

Cheers to the entire FOSS@NITC Team and all the speakers.. :)

Hi Raman and others,

> 6.Programming Languages: C,C++                      
>   Sakthi        

Ahh! Don't assign me to any stall. I'll keep moving
around answering questions and clarifying doubts to
the visitors.

> Install of Linux & Careers with GNU/Linux: 11.00 - 
> 11.30   Shakthi & Raman

I will atleast need 30 minutes for "Careers with
GNU/Linux".

I'd appreciate if you can find time to play two
movies:

1. Revolution OS (85 minutes)
2. The.Code.Linux.avi (60 minutes)

Keeping the introductory talk to 15 minutes and
playing the movie will give them the big picture. A
picture is a thousand words!

> 8. Advanced Programming gcc,make etc  or Device 
> Driver programming  (Sakthi shall choose or cover 
> both)   15.30 - 16.00    Sakthi

For beginners, device driver programming will not make
any sense. I shall cover gcc, Makefiles, make.

A request to new speakers:

1. Please stick to the time. Most of them _never_
follow this.

If your slot is between time x and time y (x<y), stop
before time y. If you delay, all other's schedules
will get delayed. Or, we may have to find a way to get
you out in time y.

2. Never prepare a speech. Just jot down the
points/topics that you want to address.

3. Don't be monotonous in your speech. Use some voice
modulation.

4. Expect feedback from the audience. Make it
interactive.

5. Never put too much text in your slides. Keep text
to a minimal, and use large size  in your fonts. If
you can give as much demos or provide screenshots, the
audience will be interested.

Raman, please let me know if the changes can be
incorporated,

Thanks,

SK

Which distro?

You have to check that in df output.

Recent distros have udevd running that detects the
device files (/dev/sda etc.) and automatically mount
them for you.

 ps -e | grep udev

I need to create similar to XP type of  handling the devices.What happens
when you attach an USB device gets attached in your XP machine?..it gets
attached, mounted(not a windows term :) ) and INFORMS THE USER that the
device is safe to use now.

Yoper needs to achive a similar kinda device handling wherein when an USB
device is attached, create the node in /dev/usb(x) x being the kernel-number
and inform the user that a device is attached prior to putting an icon in
the desktop.

i am confused here whether to target HAL or DBUS or Hotplu or udev!

That is what I would prefer you to do. Unfortunately as of now we do
not have committed volunteers for most task. Also, we-those who will
be there on previous day- have to train the volunteers on seminar day
when we do not have session and also in the evening. With this idea I
thought each one of us will concentrate on the some stall.  If we get
more volunteers you can be become consultant again.

I already told you once. I will tell it you once again
nicely.

udevd runs in user-space, detects USB device
filesystem, mounts it and creates an icon on your
desktop with the mount point. 

All recent distros do this for you.

D+ and D- are USB bus data lines.

udevfs is udev filesystem support in kernel space.

hotplug support should be enabled in the kernel.

Look at HAL and udev.

More volunteers, the better. Agreed. 

Given the available number of volunteers, I want to
see how the students/faculty can make the best use of
our time.

If we keep moving around with some t-shirt or banner
saying, "How may I help you!" or something related, we
will be easily approachable. Instead if we get stuck
in one stall, at one place, it wouldn't serve the
purpose. 

IMO, let the student volunteers give the demo and if
they get any questions which they are not able to
answer, they can ask the visitors to come and ask us.
They are newbies and are learning, so we know that
they may not know the answer to everything. Its
natural. 

Remember how we did it in Carte Blanche 2005?

Just my thoughts. I'd leave that decision to you. 

> Let me discuss with college. Probably english movies
> may not be big

I just felt it will be something different from the
regular demos/talks/presentations etc. Sorry, I don't
have a tamil translation for it. Anybody interested in
doing the tamil translation for the movie?

Also, if anyone wants to use my laptop for any of your
presentations, please let me know by Thursday, March
23, 2006. I can install any software that you want.

Thanks for the quick reply.

Sorry to say, but there is nothing wrong in taking the Human Interface
Guidelines and implementing them.I do know this is a FLOSS mailing
list...but what i want to implement is Human Interface Guideline wherein the
user be notified of what is happening to the system, rather sit and see the
desktop and wait for the icon to appear.

Am trying to implement in Linux and not modifying or making the W$
functionality better.

And please do note that am also a Linux user and know where Windows
Sucks!..but there are few things that needs to done in Linux (according to
me) to make it a good-user friendly desktop and i found one of the feature
as this USB device notification to the user.

I do already have a CD Insert notification wherein when the user inserts a
CD, this daemon running background detects it, checks whether Audio or VCD
or Blank, runs a program like, "An Audio/Blank/Video/DVD is detected, what
you want to do?" and show the options...its called CDDE, check in google, u
will get the latest source code...why cant USB too done the similar way!

If this is off-topic or has hurt many users of talking about Windows, am
sorry...i cant help...

I would be happy if people could help instead criticising that this is
W$/FLOSS etc.., Please do understand that i want a feature to be implemented
in Linux and unfortunately that has been done by W$ already.So its not that
i have to switch to W$, i will be happy if i get in my desktop working.

There is a major difference between Carte Blanche and this. Then the
student knew the subject well, can handle most common queries on
their own. We have to chip-in only for few queries.

But here we have rank newbies - just one week of intro - who will be
there. It is essentially LUG show with some minimal assistance from 
student. Probably next LDD - after 6 months- in this college will be
like Carte Blanche.
Many easy topics like internet,office tools etc may not need much
help from our side though.
> Just my thoughts. I'd leave that decision to you. 
> 
Right now it is ILUGC which has to take responsibility for tech side
of the stalls. So I prefer, this time, each one of us take one stall.
They have great expectation from our volunteers and eager to learn a
lot. Let there be more physical volunteers from ILUGC please.

Not officially released yet. OSNews has jumped the gun as usual based on 
leaked mirrors. I would suggest waiting for the formal release 
announcement to make sure that you don't end up with test releases or

Hi,
 I've been using the Airtel Broadband 1000 pm unlimited pack for the
last six months (in Bangalore) or so, and for the last couple of weeks
or so I haven't been able to connect to any public tracker, all
attempts time out. I googled a bit and found that port forwarding on
the router seemed to solve the problem for many users. I've forwarded
some ports (49152+) and I've setup bittorrent to listen to those
ports, but I've still not had any success.

I have a DLink 502T router and I'm using the ethernet interface. Any pointers?

Here is a FAQ in
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ.

Q: Can I use udev to automount a USB device when I connect it?
A: Technically, yes, but udev is not intended for this. All major distributions
   use HAL (http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fhal) for this, which also
   watches devices with removable media and integrates into the
desktop software.

As per this, I think it is better to use HAL for your task. HAL and
D-BUS combined together will serve the purpose very well.

Thank you for the replies.

I'd rather have these guys continue on windows and getting this bruteforce

We already experienced it. And that is the main reason for this migration.

But the challenge now is to make the server migration as seamless as
possible.

My original plan was to just seamlessly migrate then make  all the users
comply with the security requirements of Linux. They have been shoddy so far
If suddenly all of them are asked to be more organised, they will join
together and reject the Linux migration plan itself.

I need to advocate the security points  firmly but carefully.

Take a look at this:

You have P T usha who is an Olympic gold medalist.
And you have Iswarya Rai who is a beauty Queen ( or so called)

(Linux and Wi*dows  may compare well with P T usha and Iswarya )

While P T usha can run kilometers together non stop at lightning speeds,
Iswarya can not even run for 20 meters at a stretch before crashing.

Now if you ask a common man who he will want to accompany, 90 % will
say Iswarya. ( we must understand that most of the world is driven on
external looks). The other 10 % will opt for Usha on her merits.

These 10 % are people who are intelligent. and the rest  90 % are stupids.
No Doubts. But these stupids have one strength. MAJORITY.

In world only THE MAJORITY dictates the terms

If one can beatify usha to look close to iswarya, without making her loose
her merits, only then it will become a super hit. And it is a long process.

P. T. Usha never won any Olympic medal. She has several medals in the
Asian Games, of course (including 4 golds in Seoul/1986).
Aishwarya Rai lost out to Sushmita Sen in Miss India 1994.

> While P T usha can run kilometers together non stop at lightning speeds,

She probably can't. She is a sprinter. You need a long distance runner
to run kilometres together (and that too probably not at lightning
speeds). Remember Zatopek? Or Nurmi?

Anyway, edit /etc/login.defs and change PASS_MIN_LEN to whatever you want.

I don't know why
Wanting to try Fc4.

We can have someone like Sania Mirza,an athlete who can run for
atleast a few kilometers and also has the looks.So RS , try to make
Linux into Sania, all hype but with good-but-not-good-enough at
pro-level but still has a huge fan following in general public who
have no idea about the sport.

Actually, that's exactly how Linux is seen by PHB's.

I would be there atleast for the movies. I happenned to see only the 2

necessary infrastructure (finance) to order from amazon US. Thumbs up

You have got me interested. And guess what - /etc/login.defs is
deprecated. Here is what I have found:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17487

This minimum length option is to be specified in
/etc/pam.d/system-auth (and it is more complicated than what we
thought it was). To change the minimum length requirement to 4
characters, what you need to do is to have:

password  required pam_cracklib.so dcredit=0 ucredit=0 ocredit=0
lcredit=0 minlen=4

Read the full bug content - it is very illuminating.

Hi,

I have asked this person, Gopal, and folks from other
free/open source companies in Chennai who are
interested in providing their place for our meets, to
meet us during our monthly/regular meets to take this
further:

<quote>

We, Gem Infotech Systems Private Limited is an end to
end open source organization engaged in product,
support, service & training.

We are proud to say that our organization was
instrumental in initiating Tamilnadu Government
departments to switchover from Microsoft to Linux
namely T.N. Rural Development Department where 5500
village panchayats installed with Linux based systems,
Civil Supplies & Consumer Protection
Department on Ration Card Management Systems, Tamil
Nadu Water Supplies & Drainage Board on World Bank
projects, Tamil Nadu Electricity Board on Online Bill
payment system etc. We are also successful in our
effort on T.N. School project where 6683 schools each
with 1 server with 9 desktops on Micosoft platform
converted to dual boot system with Linux and open
office. We are also working on other major projects
with T.N. Government where Open Source plays a
predominant role.

We have a meeting room in our office which can
accommodate about 12 people and can be used for any
ilugc meeting at free of cost.

Kindly contact us for any further details /
clarification.

I had been thinking of what to show them, as they are said to have 
little knowledge over Linux. As my topic puts me directly into the 
desktop, I think i will start from the login screen, take either GNOME 
or KDE ( won't have enuf time to show both). Show them how it is easier 
to use the desktop. And start with the Menu, show them some most used 
applications reserving some 20 Minutes for showing OpenOffice - Writer 
and Impress which will be very usefull to them. As this is my first such 
talk/seminar, I am not sure about time management. I will just try to 
cover as much as i can in the 45 minutes. I am not planning to use any 
presentation kinda, rather show them a demo of things. :)

As the audience is presumed to be a bit low on english, can we use tamil 
inbetween our talks so that the students understand things more better ? 
How many will attend the talks ? some 200-250 ?

Thanx shakti for your tips for the seminar-newbies :D

And, coming to the LDD - I will use the time after the talk with the 
student volunteers of my stall and try to show them how to present the 
thing. I had a similar plan in MIT which i couldn't execute. As this 
time, I have time prior to the LDD to spend with the volunteers I will 
try to make it.

Raman,
I can also take incharge of another stall, ie Internet Applications. 
Will there be internet connection available atleast in these stalls so 
that we can show the actual working of Thunderbird, Firefox, Gaim and 
IRC ?? Can the two stalls, Open Office and the Internet be put next to 
one another so i can manage both the stalls ? :)

Good. Good. You can also show the xgl-opengl-demo
video. When I showed this to the SSN folks, they were
in great awe! You should have seen their faces :)

Yes, please. 

I never bother about college formalities - always ask
the students if they are comfortable with Tamil, if
they say yes, simply proceed with it.

I wish I knew Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Marathi,
Oriya, Bengali, et. al.

Maybe we can setup a LAN ourselves!

How many of us are carrying laptops? Aanjhan, Joe,
Asokan, myself?

We can probably even setup a wireless network, run
different servers. It would be awesome!

When all of us FLOSS enthusiasts get together, we are
going to have one heck of a time and lot of fun :)

I am not stressing more on Embedded Linux as it would not be appropriate n 
an intoductory session. Kindly give me an hour if possible. I would like to 
give speech on
Contributing to FOSS and Doing Academic Projects using FOSS tools. I will of 
course give an overview of Embedded Linux.. But I would like to stress on 
FOSS as such.
Regarding the Stalls.. I dunno whether I will be available as I got some 
family work that day. Anyways if I am available I would like to assist 
people in general and not get stuck up with a single stall..

Kindly let me know the updates.

Aanjhan

Thanks for the links.I had already gone with those links, they all gave
information about what is what, but i didnt see examples on how to manage
the devices using udev or hal.Thats the one i am looking for and i want to
implement exactly as abstracted here - http://www.ometer.com/hardware.html

This approach in that link seems to be not the one to be discussed in the
List as told by Shakthi becoz afaik , these things are already implemented
in W$. I dont see that am cloning or bringing the concept of W$ here - Its a
feature which every home user needs.Maybe for an expert, this seems to be a
stupid way, but i feel, linux has will rule every home once
implemented.Andthats the reason why HAL,DBUS,Hotplug,Kudzu are in the
linux community.

Sorry to be harsh, but i dont like people being criticised for nothing!....

My kind advice is , if people dont like ones post, it is better not to reply
than replying and telling that this is "damn thing" and etc.,.I think
everyone can understand.LUG is for Linux and to improve Linux.

Thanks again to KaruppuSwamy, to give atleast a set of links where i can get
some information.These kinda small helps would always keep a person moving.

The ometer hardware abstraction document was written by Havoc Pennington 
and David Zeuthen (both from Red Hat ) wrote the hardware abstraction 
library based on the same idea and specification. So the thing you are 
looking for already exists and is being widely used in the form of HAL.  
If you need more details on HAL, ask in the project mailing list.

Hello .

 Are there any RHCE training institutes in Chennai ?

And the RHCE exam pattern ?
If anybody had managed to make it to RHCE please send me tips / referral
websites .

The only thing you need to crack RHCE is working knowledge of RedHat (RHEL)
and 100% practice :)

That is best. You are on of the most fortunate speaker, you don't

Not only you all of us have to do this. Once one's talk is over,
straight away head to the lab where student volunteers will be
available. Spend time with them, load the system, train them etc.

prepare.

dont know. but if we look at the membership roster, it shows about 1050
'regular' (non-digest) members and about 950 digest members. fortunately, it
would appear that most digest mode members are in listen-only mode (or they
really know how to use digest mode intelligently), so there is only a very
limited problem of this type of arbitrary subject lines.

Well, Sania Mirza is how we all see Windows. Surviving only on the
strength of marketing, no hope of any sustained performance in her
peer group. But the whole nation has heard about her and she is a role
model to wannabes who have no clue about the sport she takes part in.

Linux on the other hand, is Joshna Chinappa. Truly world class in her
chosen sport, which probably is unappealing to television (ie, no
marketing). She actually -wins- international tournaments. People
claim Joshna is the Sania of squash (read: Linux imitates Windows)
when we all know that it is Sania who's not qualified to hold the
candle to Joshna.

Touche. :) Can we have a rule that if someone quotes the entire digest
to the list or fail to change the subject line or both, he gets
converted to regular subscriber as a "punishment"? :)

Hello everyone,
Will there be cd burning stalls on 26th...
We can ask the coll authorities to inform visitors to bring their own
blanks....and can anyone bring the latest gentoo cds..plz ;)

Anyway, While most of the LUGGERS are leavin on 25th itself, what about
the transport of the LDD volunteers on 26th, I am really confused at
this....

And regarding the snipping of digest mails, it helps to keep *me*
organised..so let it stay..:)

No most will be coming on 26th. The college will arrange for
transport on Sunday morning to reach in time.

This arrangement is what making me cry- they are asking for how many
will come form ILUGC - but so far only 6 people (other than Seminar
speakers) have confirmed. I repeat - please - let me know by today or
 atleast tomorrow how many of you are volunteering. The college will
arrange for van/bus based on our numbers.

Boy, I might actually win the superficiality stakes - I just read the 
whole thread to find out why on earth you guys are discussing Sania & 
Joshna here. Heh heh. Being the ex-Hyderabadi that I am, I should 
probably defend Sania by saying that her sport is very competitive, and 
probably Joshna doesn't have to try as hard as Sania to get to the top - 
that's just a guess, though. I should probably mark this as OT, too ;-)

I don't think killing the digest feature is a good idea.Every mailing
list has one, and everyone violates it at some point.If we can have a
spam rule in mailman which discards Digest-Subject mails as spam it
would be a tad better(and stricter).

People sending digest-based mails are usually first timers to mailing
lists and shutting them off would not be the right thing to do.A
stricter policy would help with a moderator, but then again, who is to
bell the cat ?

What is the command you used to connect?

what is the value of CVSROOT?

and what message does it throw when you try to connect?

	HI I got working like this 

	I was exporting the CVSROOT earlier on the remote machine as 

export CVSROOT=:pserver:root@100.100.100.28:/home/cvs

But when I tried 

export CVSROOT=:pserver:root@100.100.100.28:/home/cvs/

 

However I have a problem again. I am able to log and checkout the files
as root.

But if I do any modifications and try to get it checkin them, I fail.

It says

 

# cvs commit first_cvs

(A file open with some related and info and when I close it I find)

Log message unchanged or not specified

a)bort c)ontonue e)dit !)reuse this message unchanged for remaining dirs

Action: (continue) c 

cvs [server aborted]: 'root' is not allowed to commit files

 

What am I doing wrong in this?

Any ideas?

but the windows xp notification , where it will notify users when a new

The message says it all root user is not allowed to make any commit in
CVS by default. Below is what I find as a explanation...

'root' is not allowed to commit files
    When committing a permanent change, CVS makes a log entry of who
committed the change. If you are committing the change logged in as
"root" (not under "su" or other root-priv giving program), CVS cannot
determine who is actually making the change. As such, by default, CVS
disallows changes to be committed by users logged in as "root". (You
can disable this option by commenting out the definition of
CVS_BADROOT in `options.h' before building CVS.


Try commit with other normal user. Note that user needs write
permission on $CVSROOT directory.

Hi Raman and others,

Is the exhibit hall air-conditioned?

This is the list we prepared in 2005:

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2005-March/016904.html

So, I'd be happy to take any install along with
handling "Tech Support".

Are the folks from NRC-FOSS participating, other than
Hariram Aatreya?

hi everybody: this is Srinivasan from NRCFOSS.

we plan to have a stall on NRCFOSS activities and have interactions re
student projects. Besides Hari, six more members have expressed interest.

Sujith, Purusothaman, Venkatesh, Chandrakumar and Idris -- could join you
for the Sunday morning trip. Will ask Venkatesh to reconfirm.

Subathra hails from Thiruvannamalai and will go there  Friday or so.

I suppose I am being considered as part of the AEC host team -- would like
to be there on Saturday. I could join those of you who are leaving on
Saturday morning. Will check up with Raman on this.

Best wishes, Srinivasan.

Hi,

1. Ensure that your firmware is loaded properly.

2. You can try disabling IPV6 by editing /etc/modules.conf. Comment and
uncomment as shown below:

#alias net-pf-10 ipv6
alias net-pf-10 off

Its a top-post. Please don't do that in the mailing
list.

@ Pevee:

Please post output of:

 /sbin/ifconfig -a
 /sbin/iwconfig -a
 /sbin/lsmod
 /sbin/route -n

You can redirect output to a file and post its
contents here (don't send it as attachment to the
mailing list). For example:

 /sbin/route -n > route.txt

i would think that those are mostly ppl who would have unsubscribed, but dont
bother because they only get one mail a week - would suggest converting all to
non-digest mode, which would separate the sheep from the goats - but before
that, a mail from admin asking for feedback is necessary

It is true. Personally I have seen many people, they NEVER read the
digest mesg, fwd it to a folder and delete it. They are unnecessary
load to the mail server and network.

> - would suggest converting all to non-digest mode, which would
> separate the sheep from the goats

No. We will hear more cry, like "Plz un-subscribe me", in the list. So
We can remove digest mode. If they want, they can resubscribe in
normal mode.

Bye :)

But i nice thing about FC5 is the new SELINUX Policy.

I agree it is not for the normal user, but still it is very cool now. 
With the introduction of Reference Policy and MCS, it is really great.

It is ridiculous that your bootloader is corrupt and you need to
reinstall the full OS - that happens only in the Windows world. What
you need is the FC4 rescue CD, which is an 84 MB download (but you
might find all the mirrors busy at the moment because FC5 has only
been just released).

Hi,

Been planning to do this for a long time, finally did it today.
If you follow OpenBSD, all their development happens in Hackathon's
held mostly in Canada,for this they fly in people from around the
world and get them together under one roof and hack away at
code..either OpenBSD or OpenSSH or any part of the OpenBSD subsystem
which requires attention.

One such hackathon: http://kerneltrap.org/node/5186

Something happened in 2003,Theo went ahead and made anti-Iraq remarks
and DARPA cut off their funds.
http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,80473,00.html

Today OpenBSD needs funds to continue the hackathon-culture.The CD
sales have dried up and as people prefer to use the FTP mirrors
instead.The project's "press" release:
http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20060321034114

So I ordered a tee-shirt from OpenBSD.org

Here it is: http://openbsd.org/tshirts.html#9

Costs $25 + shipping but worth it,and it's for a good cause.

It's a not a big amount and OpenBSD CD's are worthless to me(for now )
and I'm not an IT manager to donate money but the tee is a small way
of saying Thank You for their work on OpenSSH which basically makes my
life complete. :)

Using Apache's htpasswd command to manipulate the $CVSROOT/passwd file
is the preferred way. Check other things that might cause the error.

Hi,

I wish to inform you all that after our introductory
workshop at SSN College of Engineering, SSN Nagar,
they have started their own ssnlug :) - to promote
FLOSS activities amongst students/faculty/management
on-campus.

I believe, there are SSN students subscribed to this
mailing list.

It would be helpful if you could join us, and
participate in our two-day workshop at Arunai
engineering college, this weekend.

Thanks,

SK

I disagree !!, I'm one of the user who switches between digest mode
and normal mode very often. Digest mode is quite helpfull for guy like
me who prefers lurking lists.

And, though I am not an OpenBSD user myself, people must know that
Theo de Raadt is a strong advocate of open source drivers, and often
has (rightly) criticized Linux developers for allowing non-free
drivers to stay as the norm for many hardware. So, though he may be
unpoular for many of his controversial remarks (See
http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Theo_de_Raadt), he does follow free
software principles.

Just some comments.

Subject: [Ilugc] problem with xilinx system ace driver for compact flash
Message-ID: <44213776.1060106@gmail.com>

Hi Friends,

I am working on xilinx system ace driver for compact flash sitting on a 
fpga based pci card.
Host: x86, linux-2.4-20-8
The host interacts with fpga on the pci bus, and an xilinx ace 
controller acts as an interface in between the fpga and compact flash.
I got the xilinx code from linuxppc kernel "xilinx_systemace".
The problem is :
I am able to insmod the module but when i try to look at the partitions 
with fdisk, the command just reads the ID data sector and stops.
It doesnt give the prompt back nor display the partitions nor  it hangs 
the kernel.

Anyone Please help me in this regard.
Please let me know if any information is required.

Thanks
Sudheer

But, you are using x86 as your target system.

How did you cross-compile it? Any pointers to source
code?

Can you hit control-C or control-D to see if you get
the prompt back? If yes, the process was blocking,
else, a deadlock situation.

Do you want to follow it up here or at:

Message-ID: <3AEC1E10243A314391FE9C01CD65429B37FDC4@mail.esn.co.in>

Dear Linux Team,

 

I am trying to understand the USB Architecture and write my own client
driver under Linux and some mew concepts of 2.6.x.

 

My point of about kref

----------------------

Used when the multiple threads are involved within the driver.

I am not sure whether this can be when there are no thread within the
driver and to control the Process synchronization. Can I get some
clarity on this?

 

Main Question

-------------

I have seen that kref_init () is issues in probe.     // no issue with
this

 

Device memory allocation and Kref_get() call are issued in open context.
Fine.ok.

 

In that case kref_put should be called in close context or any error
context. Right?

Yes, I find these two being issued in the usb-skeleton driver.

 

But, I find additional kref_put() call in disconnect? That too without
any condition checking? Why do I need it here?

 

Regards,

Mukund Jampala

You are correct, but one correction :). Its the HAL which does the magic and
you can find windows also has HAL incorporated in it.

In Linux, this feature is still in development with HAL,DBUS,Udev
emerging.The key to implement these is to write proper HAL policies and Udev
rules.SuSe has implemeted this well. But i dont have any SusE resource with
me :(. I also heard that Ubuntu is also progressing fast in this area.

I am still searching for working examples of HAL policies and UDEV rules for
storage-devices like USB...but not getting a proper one...

You hav to edit files called wvdial.conf and resolv.conf.
resolv.conf should contain the nameserver or whatever with which you
resolv the connection with ur isp.
The chaps at support centre will provide you with that one..

You could also use gnome-ppp or kppp (but u need to enter the
nameservers though)

Just remember that you dial to #777 for cdma phones and default
Initialization string should be changed to AT+CRM=1..and you are
rocking. Play around the GUI for that

Code should always be such that it will work when
multiple processes/threads are involved.

In 2.6 kernels:

struct kref {
 atomic_t refcount;
}

Source:
http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/linux/kref.h#L23
 
In 2.4 kernels:

static __inline__ void atomic_inc(volatile atomic_t
*v)
{
  unsigned long flags;
 
  __save_flags_cli(flags);
  v->counter += 1;
  __restore_flags(flags);
}

Source:
http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/asm-arm/atomic.h?v=2.4.20#L53

... and also extensively in 2.6 device drivers when
they bring in kobjects, ksets, and ksubsystems.

In 2.4 kernels, to allocate resources to processes,
and to know how many are using it you will use the
following functions: atomic_inc(), atomic_dec() et.
al.

Similarily in 2.6 kernels, with the integration of the
new device class model, you will be using kref_get(),
kref_put() et. al.

Source: http://lxr.linux.no/source/lib/kref.c#L30

I'd definitely recommend that you read "Chapter 14:
The Linux Device Model" from Linux Device Drivers by
Alessandro Rubini and Jonathan Corbett.

Subject: 	[GNU/FSF Press] Press Release: GPL tested in US courts in Wallace

The GPL tested in US courts - Wallace Vs FSF.

The GNU General Public License stands firm.

On Monday March 20, 2006 US Federal Judge John Daniel Tinder, dismissed
the Sherman Act antitrust claims brought against the Free Software
Foundation. The claims made by Plaintiff Daniel Wallace included: that
the General Public License (GPL) constituted a contract, combination or
conspiracy; that it created an unreasonable restraint of trade; and that
the FSF conspired with IBM, Red Hat Inc., Novell and other individuals
to pool and cross-license their copyrighted intellectual property in a
predatory price fixing scheme.

Peter Brown, FSF Executive Director, responded to the news, "As the
author of the GPL and copyright holder on the largest body of GPL'd
covered free software, the FSF hears many theories of potential legal
claims and challenges to the GPL. We hear the fear, uncertainty and
doubt (FUD) expressed, that the GPL has never been tested in court, and
that somehow that is a sign of its weakness. Nothing could be further
from the truth of course. Put quite simply, if you don't accept the
terms of the GPL, then you have no rights to the copyrighted works it
covers. What is there left to test? The GPL is a software license, it is
not a contract. It gives permissions from the copyright holder. You
don't want to accept those permissions? End of discussion."

On Monday, a US Federal Court Judge dismissed Daniel Wallace's case
saying "[The GPL] acts as a means by which certain software may be
copied, modified and redistributed without violating the software's
copyright protection. As such, the GPL encourages, rather than
discourages, free competition and the distribution of computer operating
systems, the benefits of which directly pass to consumers. These
benefits include lower prices, better access and more innovation."

Brown continued, "Let us all stop and consider the consequences of what
this US Federal Judge has said. On being presented with the facts
surrounding the GPL, he was able to define a range of benefits available
to those that value the freedoms delivered by the GPL. The question we
are all left with is, why would anyone put up with the inferred
consequences of proprietary software?", and, "If you care about lower
prices, better access to software, or more innovation, then GPL'd
software is for you. Or as the Free Software would describe that, you
value freedom".

Having dismissed the case, and finding in favor of the FSF and against
Wallace. The Judge also allowed FSF costs against Wallace. Wallace, now
has thirty days to appeal the decision, but the FSF expects no relevant
news on this matter.

Hi,

Fedora core 5 has a minor problem with Nvidia geeforce cards & some
other cards. It is working
alright, but 3d acceleration is not enabled & vendor supplied driver
is not supported
in the kernel shipped with the distro. For details see this link 
http://fedorasolved.com/viewtopic.php?t=197 .
Fedora(Redhat) is working on this problem & next kernel update is
expected anymoment according to the above site, to solve this problem

Hi all,

Atlast after series of attempts and getting to know how udev manages and
what HAL is ,i was able to get notified when my usb thumbdrive got plugged
in :).

UDEV
======

It is done with udev. What happens when you plug in an device?. The kernel
identifies it as usb device, the bus name corresponds to "usb" and the
kernel action that is taking place is "add" this new device by loading the
appropiate modules.So here, the kernel sends the "add" message to the udev
to get the device node created.The udev creates it.

Now how to get the kernel message "add" and perform what we need?

Here comes into picture, the "udev rules". The udev has rules in the
/etc/udev/rules.d directory where each rule will be executed in a lexical
order when udev starts.The extension of a rule file is .rules. So i created
10-chaks.rules and added the following,

BUS=="usb", ACTION=="add", NAME="usb%n", RUN+="/usr/bin/mount-usb.sh usb%n"

I think the rule is self explanatory.

1) Check for bus usb
2) Check for action add
3) Apply the name usb%n than sda or sdb
4) Run the program given along with other programs which will run for this
device
5) For further queries, just see man udev - they are very clear and
documented good.

This is one way you can capture the device "add" from the kernel when it
passes to udev.

I even got links where it had written that udev is going to replace hotplug
fully and this article http://lwn.net/Articles/156027/ tells that ubuntu is
replacing hotplug with udev and also Yoper is moving forward with this
approach.

HAL
====

So what is HAL?

Here is a good info on HAL -->
http://www.redhat.com/magazine/003jan05/features/hal/

I understood HAL to be a separate layer with which desktop applications can
interact and get to know what the kernel is doing with the devices, whether
the device is getting detected or added or removed.The gnome-volume-manager
implements this but still is development stage.There is also an application
called KDE-HAL-Device-Manager which is a gui app for the program
"lshal".Type "lshal" in your shell and see the devices identified and
attached for your system.

HAL is able to do this with the interaction with dbus and kernel.The dbus
first gets informed and has the information on what device it is(usb or scsi
or pci etc.,).dbus python bindings are available to program.

So using HAL and an application program , you can capture USB add or
removal.But this requires the knowledge of dbus python programming.The dbus
source has examples on how to program in python.

Road to Success
==============

This is my first initial step which i thought i should share with ilugc.

The above udev example works for only usb thumbdrives having only one
partition(/dev/sda).It doesnt work for USB Mass Storage Devices where you
have more than one partition(/dev/sda1,/dev/sda2 etc.,).Need to dig around a
bit deeper for this.

Also, need to know what is the message relevant to when a CD ROM is inserted
and how it gets to know that it is Audio or Video or Blank CD or
DVD.gnome-volume-manager handles this also.

My longterm goal is to create a hal daemon monitoring for these services and
perform the necessary actions.

I dont want to use gnome-volume-manager as it is also in the development
stages and since there are not so many applications available in this area,
i have planned to write an application.

Friends who are very eager to help, can join me in this and you need not run
Yoper for this as dbus,udev,hal are common in every linux distribution
except for their rules :).

If this seems to be a mail where it violates ilugc policies and imitates W$
as shakthi said, am sorry, THIS IS A FEATURE OF LINUX KERNEL IMPLEMENTED AND
I WANT IT TO BE ENHANCED WITH GOOD SUPPORT AND APPLICATIONS FOR THIS
FEATURE.

Thanks for patiently reading my mail....will update as and when i progress
further....

great! in fact, i had once asked the mailing list if there are any
lightweight (in terms of libs, dependencies etc.) alternatives to
gnome-volume-manager. haven't found any since. it would be great if
you can come up with something like that. now that you have mentioned
it, i could once again see through the net if i can find alternatives.
ready to help you with what i can, in this endaevour :)

Thanks for volunteers. Can you please tell which topics they will be
interested in ?

Not much, if you ask me. For that matter, dynamic languages like Python 
and Ruby would be not-so-ideal choices for doing real time apps. 
Especially, since there is the extra burden of managing lots of dynamism 
(typing-related) and memory management with GC etc, performance would be 
pretty poor. Lots of resource-intensive parts of Ruby apps (like 
Mongrel, the webserver) are still written as C modules.

Of course, you wouldn't need to do much of that for regular apps, but 
Real-Time apps are a completely different game. I don't know much about 
RT stuff, maybe somebody else can explain about the languages ideal for 
this kind of apps.

> is there any ide for Ruby scripting language ?

Lots of them. There's RDT (based on eclipse) and a Rails-specific ide 
called RadRails, also based on Eclipse. jEdit, though a java editor, has 
superb bindings for Ruby and Rails too. There's Komodo (commercial) and 
FreeRide (just google for these names) and there are some excellent 
debuggers too.

HTH,
Vamsee.

Its actually the host controller device driver
(EHCI/OHCI/UHCI) that identifies the device. There is
a Port Status/Control register for each host
controller, and the Connect Status Change bit is set
to 1 when a device is plugged in.

EHCI specification:
http://www.intel.com/technology/usb/ehcispec.htm

The basic idea of USB in Linux is like this:

  application
       |
    usbcore.ko 
       |
ehci-hcd/uhci-hcd/ohci-hcd

usbcore interacts with low level hardware, implements
hub operations, and also interacts with application
(client and class drivers).

... only if the drivers are not loaded during boot
time.

In 2.6 kernels, it also updates sysfs.

Which kernel are you talking about? In 2.6 kernels,
the USB device enumeration, block device drivers have
changed and it can detect multiple partitions as well.


The kernel will print messages like:

 sda: p1 p2 p4

Try, OPTIONS="all_partitions".

I think you would have already read this?

dear friends: i am happy about the enthusiastic response from ILUG members
re LDD at Arunai Engg College -- both as member of NRCFOSS and as ex-Faculty
of Arunai. I presume Mr. Raman and others who have visited AEC received a
good response from the students and staff, and are comfortable with the
scenario.

We could have the following focus:
Saturday workshop --  CSE / IT / MCA  regarding development and deployment
Sunday exhibition -- spread the net wide -- philosophy, concept and
advantages of FOSS
As of now, Mr. M.R. Rajagopalan, Director, C-DAC  Chennai has agreed to
inaugurate the exhibition.

I hope to gather a cross section of students & staff from non-computer
departments to interact with LUG/FOSS group and discuss on various project
options. Depending on your convenience, this could be done on Saturday
afternoon or on Sunday.

As Prof Krishnan (Director, AU-KBC and Jt Coordinator, NRCFOSS) has been
pointing out to me, we may have to cater to all engg colleges under Anna
Univ (and possibly some of the deemed univ, not to speak of non-engg
colleges). e.g., Have received a mail from Nandanam College, Thirupattur
that they want to start a LUG. [Can we give them some guidelines? suggest
that they can kickstart the operations with an LDD?]

Hope to discuss with Raman, Bharathi and others on this and work out a
strategy -- with cooperation from all of you.
Thanks and best wishes, Srinivasan.

It would be nice to keep it open to all departments. 

Inter-department and inter-disciplinary work can be
done well with FLOSS. Examples: bioinformatics,
embedded et al.

... and also students/faculty/management in our
neighbouring states as well - Kerala, Karnataka,
Andhra Pradesh. There needs to be more FLOSS
collaboration with them as well.

Do you have a dual-booting Windows box? Looks to me as if Windows is
infecting your Linux.

The next symptom is that apt or yum or whatever tries to connect to
windowsupdate. Keep an eye on your firewall logs.

I have a feeling that Prasanna means 'practical' or 'enterprise'
applications when he says real time. I dont think he means real time as in
RT(Linux)! Correct me if am wrong Prasanna.

If you mean practical, then you have basecamp running on ruby. I think
flickr is ruby too. So doing heavy duty is not a problem for ruby.

will do....

i do have one problem in my rule,

BUS=="usb", ACTION=="add", NAME="usb%n", RUN+="/usr/bin/mount-usb.sh usb%n"

the %n holds the kernel device number, that is , suppose it creates at
/dev/sda1, the kernel number is 1 and /dev/sda3, it is 3. So for /dev/sda it
is nothing (i hope this is correct). The above rule actually creates
/dev/usb and so usb%n is probably ok now. Then, i pass the same as argument
to the script.There comes the problem, when i check for the command line
argument it is usb1 where it should have been usb. I have no idea how this
got changed!. Another notable point is if i do eject /dev/usb1, it throws
error teling no device to open, and eject /dev/usb works which also
clarifies that the usb is getting created at /dev/usb.

any ideas?

But, you persevered to learn. Hence, my reply and a
bit of help. [1]

Basically /dev/sda is the device filename for a
particular device.

/dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, /dev/sda3, et. al. represent the
partitions/blocks in /dev/sda.

Probably, usb bus 1?

Always eject from the mount point, /mnt/whatever or
/media/whatever, that your distro uses.

As a user you only access the devices through the
mount point. Never touch the device files.

When you access your files through the mount point,
through syscalls the device files are accessed for
read/write operation. Something like:

 mount point    (user-space)
     | 
    VFS         (kernek-space)
     |
   SCSI
     |
  block device driver
     |
  ehci-hcd
     |
  hardware

Have fun.

Greetings!

I request the volunteers to take a backup copy of
their software/presentations to a USB thumb drive,
just in case.

If you don't have one, and if you would like me to
dump your presentations/documents to my laptop hard
disk, please e-mail the same to me by Friday evening,
March 24, 2006 1900 hrs IST. Also mention the license
under which your documentation/presentation/code is
released in.

I usually upload docs to my domain, take a backup in
my USB thumb drive, and have a copy in my hard disk.

Thanks,

SK

When using hardware debuggers (Lauterbach/RealView),
that are ethernet-based, you can remotely control them
and the board.

Oh. Didn't think of that. If you mean "real-world apps" Prasanna, then 
there are quite a few. Thanks to Rails, there are lots of heavy-duty 
sites running Ruby. As mano said, Basecamp is one (www.basecamphq.com) 
and 43Things (www.43things.com) - both of them get around 1 million hits 
per day.

alistapart.com recently moved to Rails (it's one of the top ezines for 
web design - very high traffic), then there is Joyent.com (read their 
weblog Joyeur.com - amazing stuff). Even penny-arcade.com, that horrible 
comic strip. I could go on.

Vamsee.

Message-ID: <BAY110-F17D493E5D56EC402BE00FBBFDE0@phx.gbl>

Hello friends,

When I am trying to install CentOS linux 4.2 on my desktop machine, I am 
recieving the following error message,
"No hard drives have been found. You need to manually choose the device 
drivers for the installation to succeed. Would you like to select the driver 
now?"

I am experiencing the same issue even after selecting the device driver 
manually.

I am using Segate SATA hardisk. The harddisk is detected in windows and not 
by the Centos linux. Below mentioned is my SATA configuration.
__________________________________

I have googled to find the appropriate device driver for my SATA hard disk

Thanks in advance.

Which kernel does it boot with? 2.6 kernels have good
SATA support.

Probably there is an option to boot with a 2.6 kernel.

Don't you get tech support with CentOS?

Ok folks, I take it back - Penny Arcade sure runs on Rails, but it's not 
"horrible" - Now that I read it again, I actually like it ;-). I 
confused it with some other comic strip I used to read long back - 
apologies to PA fans out there (including Toufeeq ;-)

Subject: [Ilugc] Login Problem _ Root unable to log in
Message-ID: <4422E802.7040405@gmail.com>

   Hello Luggies,

   Sub: Not able to login as root in FC4
   First let me tell how the problem started. I have been using GNOME as my
   default window manager from the day i started using my FC4. I had selected
   automatic login into my login id, the first time the system boots up ie at
   first login. It was fine for such a long time. Last week, i though of
   using KDE for sometime. When i logged out from GNOME and logged in into
   KDE, it dint ask me the usual question it 'used to' ask... whether i want
   to have KDE for this particuar session or want it to be made default ?
   But, i still thought nothing was wrong. Then , i googled for changing the
   default window manager.

   The first web site told me to alter/create a file ~/.xinitrc and include
   "exec startkde" which i tried but nothing changed. During that time, i was
   able to login as root after loging off from my login. Refer:
   http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/changeman.html

   With prashant's help i found another website which told me another
   alternate method to change my default window manager. It asked to open
   "/etc/sysconfig/desktop" and change the "DESKTOP=GNOME" to "DESKTOP=KDE"
   and also add "DISPLAYMANAGER=KDE" in the nest line. I changed this in
   Emacs and rebooted the machine. Then, the default manager got changed to
   KDE and i have been using it for a weeks time.

   Yesterday, when I was using Synaptic Package Manager, it wasnt respoding
   so i treid to kill the proces.. First with Ksysgaurd but it said it cldnt
   kill syanptic as it was root's process. Then, i tried kill pid of syanptic
   using -su. This too failed to give results.

   When i logged in today, it still said syanptic was running. So, i decided
   to login as root and try whether i would be able ot kill it. When i logged
   out of KDE and tried loging in as root, the login reported that "root
   login not allowed". I changed the login screen to "Happy GNOME with
   browser" which shows what all the available logins at the login screen. To
   my surprise, it showed me no root as the available logins. Then, i removed
   the "DISPLAYMANAGER=KDE" line from /etc/sysconfig/desktop thinkig it might
   have some effect. Also noted tht, the login screen took time to change
   from blue curve to 'happy gnome' ( which occured only after i removed the
   line, which might have been coincidence also).

   Now, my total login and window manager is literaly in a mess. I am not
   able to Login as ROOT ! :((

   Kindly help me what to do ?! As I am leaving for Arunai LDD on sat, tomm
   evening will ve a testing time for me to correct there things :|

   Thanks in advance

For my school, we bought, 128kbps 700 /- per month [ 600 +100 ] plan
With 2 GB of download limitation
Our usage will be
1) daily email checking at sancharnet and hotmail
2) weekly web site update with 5 mb of images
3) virus scanner downloads now and then
4) searching for educational related information. Few downloads

I intend to connect it always. ie, always on.

I wanted to know 
1) how BSNL is checking the downloaded stuff ?
2) how we can cross check it ?
3) Which is best for sharing that internet connection for 4 more systems ?
	[ WinXp to 4 WinXp  or FC to 4 WinXp or FC to 4 FC ]
4)Since we have very less web traffic , shall I use that computer itself as a

The recommended method is to create your own $HOME/.xsession file
(which should have execute permissions) and append your favorite
window manager there.

Can you login as root from the console?  You can switch to console
mostly using Ctrl+Alt+F1.  Also, check your $HOME/.xsession-errors
file.

You could have done this using the gnome-desktop-switching tool very easily
:). No need to edit any files though :)

I think you would have grub installed. While booting your system thru grub,
press "e" and in the append "3" to the "kernel" line, you will go into
runlevel 3,without GUI.Check your stuff there.And form there type "xinit" to
check for X window, if everything goes well, you will get a xterm , type
exit and come out.Now type "startx", and check what happens.

Have Fun!

I hope this might help you to check your system functioning or not.

   Thanks in advance

Debian actually prevents you from logging into X as

You should never login to X as root. Period.

another way u could have done tht us by using the following cmd,

switchdesk KDE.

The above method changes the conf for only one user, whereas wht u
have done basically changes the system defaults.

There are two things u have to understand....


1. Login is controlled by the display manager prog.

KDE in REDHAT system by default stops ROOT login.  to change this....

/etc/X11/xdm/kdmrc

file.

2. Window managers have nothing to do with DISPLAY MANAGERS. which
means u can still load kde from gdm or GNOME from kdm.

gdm in Redhat system by defaults allow root logins....
to prevent this u can edit
/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf

or

menu->system settings -> loginscreen  ( gdm conf tool in graphics.)

Hi Suraj,

I am writing to you about Shunya( http://shunya.in ), a slashdot like
effort, but this time India centric. I started shunya.in when slashdot
rejected a story I submitted, as the story was not US centric. I now
need help with spreading the word, and this email to you.

Shunya.in is different from slashdot in two ways a) shunya is India
centric and b) shunya allows users to register their adsense account
with shunya, shunya then displays ads from users adsense accounts next
to stories submitted by them. This allows users to earn money while
contributing stories to shunya.

I would really appreciate if you could forward the following to the
chennai LUG mailing list.

Thanks

Kulpreet

Why should this be the case, as opposed to say, logging into console

Message-ID: <d2a92d610603240417v2eb347day@mail.gmail.com>

I didn't see anyone else posting this, so here goes...

After several years of exemplary security record, now it appears that
a remotely exploitable vulnerability has been discovered in recent
versions of Sendmail. Some details are here:

http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/834865

Sendmail Inc.'s own advisory is here:

http://www.sendmail.com/company/advisory/

I have seen advisories of Redhat, Debian, Mandriva, Gentoo and others
(eg: FreeBSD has an advisory at
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-06:13.sendmail.asc).
You should upgrade Sendmail asap, even if your installation is not
Internet exposed.

Yep. Last modified on Monday, February 10, 1997 12:01:55 PM. I expect
X Windows security to improve somewhat in about 9 years.

True. But you do need root for several other things. For example, to
execute many of the commands listed in the above doc.

Yep, again. Users and Superusers are different. But my question was
why discourage root logins specifically from X Windows as opposed to
console login or ssh root@somehost?

its simple, as root , a hacker has access to  EVERYTHING in your system. Its
not that hacker cannot enter a linux system, but he can enter if the system
has root previliges. You can see SuSe and redhat posting many security
patches in terms of security.

even i used to login as root and work and when once one of the Yoper User
showed me that yoper kernel has a bug wherein this allows a hacker to login
to your system if you are root and he did it!

i prefer logging in as a normal user than root :)

I don't understand what you mean by "system has root privileges".

So what? How does that matter whether I should login as root or not?

I'm sure you misunderstood the situation. I haven't heard of any case
where a hacker's (cracker's, to be politically correct) access to a
system depended on whether root was loggged in or not.

>  i prefer logging in as a normal user than root :)

Your choice. I fully agree with this. My question all this time has
been why discourage X root logins specifically, and why not console
root logins or ssh root@somehost or su root or sudo bash or any of the
other ways of becoming root?

You can't just throw in an unqualified superlative and get away with
it. Why is su the best way? An inexperienced sysadmin can do an equal
amount of damage via su too.

"An inexperienced sysadmin" ,hmm...so you would hire a person who is
inexperienced !...a sysadmin knows the basic thing that the root access can
damage the system and anyone who is logged in as root have to play safe.

su, makes you to go to your root shell and execute.theres nothing to explain
and prove it is best.

if you need to be secure, be safe.having a personal desktop and logging in
as root is different from  hosting a bank server and logging in as root into
the bank server!..you cant try things out there in business or job or work!

As root, you have full control of the system. Newbies
*can* open a terminal/nautilus and see all files under
/ that are accessible. Knowingly or unknowingly if
they try to change files or modify them or delete
them, it will be difficult to recover them by
themselves, and they wouldn't even know how to explain
what they did.

Sometimes, even experienced folks might mis-spell a rm
*~ for rm *, and can cause all the files to be
deleted. There are always permission checks for users
before they open files, execute code etc., which is
not the case for root user.

One of my colleagues logged into X as root (Red Hat)
and mistakenly deleted the /lib/libc.so.6 file. Don't
ask me why. The system wouldn't boot thereafter -
obviously. I had to boot from Knoppix LiveCD, remotely
copy the file from another identical system, and
restore it.

SK

Subject: [Ilugc] Q&A About Linux Core
Message-ID: <3AEC1E10243A314391FE9C01CD65429B37FFE9@mail.esn.co.in>


Dear Linux Lovers,

This is regarding sharing my knowledge updates on Linux Scheduling and
concurrency issues. This will help new people as a reference
understanding the real core Linux OS.

Please correct me in case if I am wrong anywhere & help me produce
proper note on "kernel Scheduling & locks".

About the interrupt preemptions
-------------------------------
Common notion:
ISR is not preemptable

NO, ISR is preemptable. The ISR routine is preemptable only due to the
occurrence of another interrupt in the parse of handling the current
Interrupt. 

My questions on this
--------------------
If so, will this not propagate and cause the delay in handling the ISR1.

Example: if ISR1 is preempted by ISR2. ISR2 is preempted by ISR3. I
guess ISR2 will be executed completely and then give the chance to the
ISR1. Am I right?
In that case, the Execution is ISR1 is delayed. Is that not a problem?

About Locking:
------------------

The reasons for having locks in the kernel are to provide kernel
features like kernel preemption, multiple contexts in kernel,
self-relinquishing multi tasking & multiprocessing environment.

-- Why due to Kernel Preemption 
When a kernel module is being executed in a critical region and if the
scheduler preempts the running process

-- Why due to multiple contexts 
When a kernel module is being executed in a critical region in a read
context and if the scheduler preempts the running process and executes
the some other process using the same kernel module to write (write
context).

-- Why due to self-relinquishing or sleeping
Self-relinquishing means sleeping or giving the processor by own (Kernel
module). 

-- Why due to multi tasking
Multi tasking is achieved through preemption & when the process in some
context sleeps for a while

-- Why due to multi processing
Multi processing means same code can execute on different processors at
the same time. In that case p1 & p2 processes can try to use shared data
at the same time. This causes corruption of data.

Questions to Experts
--------------------
	On 2.6, why does a sleep in the ISR cause hanging of system.

Hardware Questions:
-------------------

Regarding Programmable interrupt controller, will it generate interrupts
continuously irrespective of INT ACK.

I mean, if an interrupt occurred and that is being serviced, is there a
chance of another interrupt being received from PIC?

If interrupts are not disabled/masked, then yes.

   Hello Luggies,
   Thanks for the advices :)

   @ Shakthi

   I generally donot login as root and thats why had atually set GNOME to
   login myself directly on first boot. But sometimes if i needed to change
   to config files i did login as root , but with fullest knowledge of what i
   was doing. The i learnt to change them with -su in consoles if i did need
   root permissions, this was after i became comfortable of using Emacs.

   I tried to login as 'root' only to end my 'syanaptic' which was running
   under root previledges and I couldnt kill it with -"su kill pid"

   @Saikiran

 menu->system settings -> loginscreen  :: for me, if i change in this then the changes take effect only after a few logins. For example, if i change the first welcome screen from blue curve to Happy Gnome, it actually changed only after a couple of logins.

 @Bharthi,

 There is no ~/.Xclients-default file. I created one ,/Xsession and ./xinitrc with "exec startkde" but it dint actually start kde. It did only after i changed /etc/sysconfig/dekstops. May be am wrong somewhere too.



   I will try what all i have learnt from all the replies to this thread :)

If nobody hired inexperienced people, nobody fresh out of the college
can get a job. Hiring is not just looking at experience. I have hired
about 15 Linux administrators (and other guys too) over the past 8 or
so years, including rank newbies to Linux administration. They start
at tier 1 support and progress towards tier 3 and then to design and

Well, we are back to square one, aren't we? Can't you do exactly the
same amount of damage to a system as su root as with a console root
login?

So you wouldn't ever login as root on a bank server?

Root access, be it via su root or X login as root are all equally
dangerous. The whole question is WHY one of those is specifically
discouraged over the others.

But, disabling the interrupts on the processor is a BAD idea and we
don't generally do it right. Yes, we do generally disable the interrupts
on the ISR Respective Device.

Can you just help me on how does a PIC generate interrupts on the
processor side? 
Support 3 interrupts occur one after the other 
>From the PIC point of view, First is the low priority interrupt, next is
the high and next is even high. Lets say they are INT1, INT2, INT3.

SO, I guess,
INT2 will preempt the INT1 ISR and INT2 ISR will be preempted by INT3.
If this is the case is the response to INT1 not delayed. Is it not a
problem?

				And 

I guess PIC will block the low priority interrupts from reaching the CPU
incase a high priority INT Acknowledgement is yet to be received.

You might want to look at immutable files, read-only mounting etc.
etc. But of course this is all beside the point, that it really
doesn't matter whether you did it from a console window or a xterm or
an ssh session. You can do the same amount of damage in any of these
cases.

And what makes you think he wouldn't have made the same mistake in a

Do you do that? logging to some host using "ssh root@somehost"?  Thats
bad anyway.

Why can't you use sudo(1) whenever necessary?  I'm just curious.

 There is scheme for Rs 800 in  vsnl and satyam for 128k, 24 hrs with

Forget logging in as root and deleting system files, its equally
stupid for a person to removing his/her files without knowing what
he/she is doing.

If somebody is so dumb, he/she would/should have aliases for everything:

shell> rm file
Are you sure you want to remove "file"? n # damn what did i do?

Isn't that lame? ;-)

instead of su root or loggin in as root from X..sudo could be used.
Its use is debatable but still you get a picture as to whos doing what
and when.

+1. I'm no linux sysadmin, but from what I know, the reason you should 
not do ssh root@something.com is because it can be brute-forced. Of 
course, good sysadmins always have non-trivial passwords, but a good 
best practice is to disable root login. Add yourself to /etc/sudoers. 
Then, you can give selective rights to your inexperienced sysadmins.

A sysadmin responsible for mail server can only touch postfix related 
commands, and such. You can sleep better knowing that you have the only 
full-powered sudo login. If you can also create a non-trivial login like 
b0099dx@something.com, brute-force chances are that much lesser. I sigh 
at my server's /etc/var/syslog where in I see brute force attempts  for 
accounts like root@blabla.com, sue@blabla.com, pete@blabla.com, etc. 
Very crude way of breaking in, but it happens.

True. Real admins will have "PermitRootLogin without-password" in
their sshd_config anyway.

> Why can't you use sudo(1) whenever necessary?  I'm just curious.

No reason. But sudo is a delegation utility. It cannot be a full
substitute for root user. For example:

1. Most people get tired of doing sudo this, sudo that and finally
will discover sudo bash. Beats the whole purpose.
2. Sudo doesn't set the environment properly (bug or feature,
depending on how you look at it). Run sudo env to see what I mean.
3. If you provide someone sudo access to a program that allows shell
escape (or even simple shell commands), it is easy to break out of the
sudo jail.
4. Sudo is useless in system recovery.
5. Several management software (some of the RAID cards I use, for
example) require root passwords anyway.
6. Lastly, Getting shell redirections to work inside sudo is a real
PITA. Eg: sudo grep someuser /etc/shadow > /etc/someotherfile - try
it. Won't work.

When you use a console as root, your only major input
mode is your keyboard. So, you will need to type in
commands, command options, arguments to execute. So,
before you hit enter, you will always look at the
commands and make sure its what you really want to do.

On the other hand, when working with X, most people
that I have seen use the mouse/touchpad/trackpoint. It
takes far less "clicks" to move around with the
filesystem, application and make changes easily. So,
when using X as root, its much easier to screw up your
system than when using the console.

My assumption is that most of the time X users don't
use the keyboard, except for text input.

Just my thoughts,

SK

I don't agree to this.  Why should somebody login as root?

Better yet, deleting the system files or my own important project
files, they both are equally bad to me.  So, be it a point-and-click
interface or a command driven program, I need to be careful when
performing anything.

Run:
sudo Xorg -configure

and copy over the config file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  That should be optimal.

or rather do `sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg` . it should hopefully
solve your problem.

P.S You can check my xorg.conf at http://prash.be/files/xorg.conf for

Choose the right horizontal and vertical frequency as specified in
your Monitor manual.
Don't just choose a random value - it might damage your monitor.

For example, i have the following configuration
Section "Monitor"
        Identifier      "SyncMaster 793s"
        Option          "DPMS"
        HorizSync       30-70
        VertRefresh     50-160
EndSection

interestingly enough, in mandrake, when you login to X as root, the screen

in that case, it is a good thing - otherwise you would still be with rh9 -
i have upgraded once or twice after foobaring my install (otherwise i am
too lazy to upgrade)

        I have a similar when I try to install Debian sarge (stable)
on a SATA harddisk.It gives out a error message in the disk
partitioning step that "No partitionable media is found".What could be
the problem.Any boot parameter to be passed? If so what is the 
parameter...?

P.S. The problem exists on all SCSI based drives .

Good show. Now try to add a standard error redirection to it.

Note that you are spawning four processes here as opposed to the
root-shell way where only one process is spawned.

I don't think killing the digest feature is a good idea.Every mailing
list has one, and everyone violates it at some point.If we can have a
spam rule in mailman which discards Digest-Subject mails as spam it
would be a tad better(and stricter).

People sending digest-based mails are usually first timers to mailing
lists and shutting them off would not be the right thing to do.A
stricter policy would help with a moderator, but then again, who is to
bell the cat ?

-Toufeeq
----------------------------------------

Pl include my name in the BIG "NO" towards killing the digest mode.
First and foremost , I am on dialup. The digest mode helps in keeping  track
of related topics in one digest itself.

It happens that I am unable to check mail from my home machine every day.
The digest mode helps me to keep track.
Then some times , when I go on Official tour , when i comeback and respond
to interesting messages which are bunched together (U all should have

Almost all of the distros/OSes (I've seen this in Solaris too) include
a README in the /etc/init.d directory which explains the order of
execution of the scripts in detail.

Anyway, the real start/stop script lives in /etc/init.d and is
symlinked to the corresponding run-level something like:

/etc/init.d/rc5.d/S19haldaemon -> ../haldaemon
/etc/init.d/rc5.d/K02haldaemon -> ../haldaemon

where S indicates start, K indicates stop/kill.  The numbers between
the S/K and the link name determines the order of start/stop.

If you want entraced to start before haldaemon (I don't know why you
need to do this), make the number before 20, something like
S10entranced.

HTH.

PS. Read the README.

On RedHat and most RedHat based distributions which use
the 'chkconfig' program to enable/disable startup services for
the default runlevel,  you can simply edit the service script
(found in /etc/init.d/ directory) and modify the commented
line that reads something like below:
       # chkconfig: 345 98 02
The first number in the above example (345) determines
the runlevels that this service would be enabled by default
(runlevel 3, 4 and 5 in this case). The second number indicates
the startup order (S98) and the third number is the kill
order (K02).

The runlevel directories (rc[0-6].d) would be located in either /etc/init.d/
or /etc/rc.d/ or in /etc/ directory itself - it all depends on the distribution.
In most cases, it would be located in one of the directories like
/etc/rc.d/ and  symlinked to other locations.

I suspect that SuSE linux follows similar structure (like RedHat) for 
determining the default startup/shutdown order. Open the service 
startup file - /etc/init.d/entrace or /etc/init.d/haldaemon and check 
for the first few commented lines to find if it has a '# chkconfig' line 
in it. If you find it, just change the second number of that line
in /etc/init.d/entrance to a lower value than what you would find in
/etc/init.d/haldaemon to make it start before haldaemon.

After modifying the number(s), run the following commands:
   chkconfig haldaemon reset
   chkconfig entrance reset
The above method works on RedHat/Fedora Core, I hope it 
does on SuSE too.

OTOH, you could manually rename/recreate the symlinks for
/etc/init.d/haldaemon and /etc/init.d/entrace in
/etc/rc5.d/ directory as shown by the following example:
   ln -s /etc/init.d/haldaemon /etc/rc5.d/S98haldaemon
   ln -s /etc/init.d/entrance /etc/rc5.d/S97entrance
[Doing so on RedHat might cause problems if you use
'chkconfig' program later on].

Hi,

Depends on your distribution and your installation method. Most distributions
would not install gcc if you perform a minimal install or skip selection of 
"Development tools/software" in a customized installation.  A couple of desktop 
Linux distributions that come on a single CD (Live distros, mostly) may not have 
gcc bundled with them.

Depends on the distro - if it's Gentoo or something else that's 
coder-targetted, it'll be included. But some others, Ubuntu and others, for 
example, don't have it in the standard install. It's a matter of installing 
it, though, and it takes no time at all. Ubuntu has it on the distribution 
CD, though I'm not sure about others.

Seems like you have enabled "Compaq Smart Array 5xxx controllers" 
support (CONFIG_BLK_CPQ_CISS_DA) without enabling scsi device
support (CONFIG_SCSI). Enable scsi device support and try rebuilding
again.

Try enabling "NAND Device Support" in Memory Technology Devices

Greetings!

The photos (more than 120) taken during the two-day
FOSS Exhibit held on March 25-26, 2006 organized by
ILUGC, and NRC-FOSS at Arunai Engineering College,
Thiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu are available at:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album26

I would like to thank the management, faculty of
Arunai Engineering College for their wonderful
support. My hearty congratulations to the students for
their valiant efforts in this event. 

Special thanks to our fellow ILUGC and NRC-FOSS folks,
and Dr. Srinivasan for taking the initiative. We had a
very good time :)

A brief summary of the events and the fun we had :

Day I : Saturday, March 25, 2006
--------------------------------

* Team I began on Saturday, March 25, 2006 morning by
0500 IST. I was picked up first, then Suman
(Triplicane), Dr. Srinivasan (Saidapet), Aanjhan and
Parthan (Kathibara junction), Raman and Bhaskar
(Tambaram). Aanjhan came by bus from Bangalore to
Chennai, the previous night and joined Parthan in the
morning. 

* We did break for breakfast. We got back in the
Toyota Qualis after breakfast and were about to leave
when we realized that Suman was not there. We found
him in the hotel.

* We arrived at around 0830 IST in the morning. As
usual, college formalities and inauguration. 

* Raman began the day's proceedings with introduction
to FLOSS, followed by Fedora Core installation. Team
2a arrived and were introduced. They moved to the labs
to train the students. After installation demo, I
discussed about career opportunities with FLOSS.
Meanwhile Team 2b, Asokan and Thyagurajan, had arrived
and introduced themselves. Suman gave an introduction
on Qt programming. 

* We had lunch between 1300-1400.

* Post-lunch session began with an excellent
presentation by Asokan Pichai on shell scripting and
the power of scripting. Thyagurajan gave a talk on
GLAMP after Asokan's talk.

* Tea break was at 1530 IST.

* Two folks from Sun Microsystems, Bangalore had come,
Arindam and Moinak. So we had to give them some time
for a session. They gave a demo of Opensolaris and
wanted more developers for the same.

* Aanjhan spoke on how students can contribute to
FLOSS.

* At 1700 we moved to the labs to help the other teams
who were training students. We finally left at 1900 to
the hotel. When we reached the hotel, one of the
students told us that we had left someone behind.
Guess who? Suman. Nevertheless, he was dropped to the
hotel.

* We had good dinner, and in Room #203, Saravanan,
Raman, Parthan and myself had good discussions about
FLOSS and ILUGC activities. We hit the sack only at
midnight.

Day II, Sunday, March 26, 2006
------------------------------

* Many folks visited the temple in the morning, and
then went to the college to help in the stalls.
Preparations were in full-swing with students helping
in setting up the stalls, putting up banners, etc.

* Team III arrived in the morning.

* The auditorium session began around 1000. Audience
were school students, college students, and general
public. I introduced them to FLOSS, showed the *nix
desktop environment, software that they can use with
GNU/Linux etc.

* The chief guest, M. R. Rajagopalan, Director, C-DAC,
Chennai inaugurated the stalls. They along with the
college management and administration folks then came
to the auditorium for a quick inauguration session.

* Lunch was at 1330.

* The stalls were bustling with activity. 

* We resumed sessions in the auditorium at 1500 and
Moinak introduced folks on Bellenix and OpenSolaris.
Arindam then began talking about core kernel hacking
to newbies (hmmm...) and continued on and on and on
till 1700, and most of them left for the stalls [1]. I
was happy they moved to the stalls as they were to
close by 1700. We didn't have time to play
The.Code.linux or have a Q&A discussion session
(interactive, like in day one). [2] 

* There was a big thanks-giving at the end of the day
to all volunteers, and we departed at 1800. 

Overall, I was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the
AEC students, and given a chance, I would go there
again.

My apologies, if I have missed any names. Please feel
free to add to the above and share your experience.

Thanking you all once again,

SK

[1] Know the audience to whom you are addressing, and
stick to the time limit. A request to colleges: When
we plan workshops, we plan it well in advance. If you
get new folks coming in on the day of the workshop and
wanting to do sessions, it becomes really tight to
squeeze everybody in. It becomes even difficult when
they don't stick to the time limit. 

[2] I will take this in the good spirit of "group
dynamics" (?) and as a valuable experience.

I am involved in ILUGC activities for nearly 4 years and been part of
several ldd/seminars etc., but nothing gave the kind of satisfaction,
this event has given me. 
The enthusiasm shown by the students is really great. The management
and faculty provided right support to the students. A big thanks to
Arunai Engg College management and faculty.

I think all the volunteers feel the same.

Subject: Vim sponsorship changes

The past few years many people have sponsored my work on Vim.  Now
version 7 is nearing completion, beta testing will start soon, very
soon.  A big thanks to all who supported me!  I would not have been able
to do this without your help.

But things are going to change.  I have accepted a job offer and will go
back to a full time job in a few months.  To avoid speculation and
rumours: I am going to work for Google in Zurich.  Fortunately I can
spend part of my time on Vim.  But it will obviously be less than the
past few years when I was working 150% of my time on Vim.

I will no longer need sponsorship to survive.  Therefore, starting the
end of March, all money given for Vim sponsorship and registration will
go to the project in Kibaale, Uganda.  And no, this is not an April
fools joke.

The voting will continue as before.  And seeing people give money will
motivate me to keep working on Vim.  The children need the help much
more than me anyway.  Thus please keep sending money!

   Hello Luggies,

   It was a very different weekend @ Arunai Engineering college. As Shakthi
   and Raman wrote it was indeed a wonderful experience :)

   First, though i have attended only very few LDDs compared with ppl like
   Raman, it was one LDD which I doubt will ever be replaced by a better one
   in future. Thank the college and CSE department for their hospitality. The
   arrangements were perfect.

   Second but no lesser, is the interest the students ie the volunteers
   showed both @ linux as well as at us. They were eager to learn from us and
   it was simply their show. We were just training them up and supporting
   them. They took over the entire LDD on their own and did them well too.

   Hope the pcitures could have shown you more than what my words can. Me and
   shakthi took around 150 snaps, though as am a digi-cam newbie my fotos
   werent good enough.

   On saturday night, me shakthi raman and saravan had one good discussion in
   our hotel room, where many plans about future LUG activities blossomed up.
   Hope they are put into action :)

   Long live the Tux ! :)

Yes, the 3rd edition for the 2.6 kernels is available
now. I think only few days back all the book stores
started getting copies of it. It costs Rs.550. 

We bought one from Eswar, T. Nagar, Chennai
http://eswar.com/.

I guess it should be available in all major book
stores in Chennai.

We had two digital cameras, Parthan's Canon and my
Sony DSC-P93. 

I set mine at 1 MB resolution, which allowed me to
take 50 pictures. After taking 50 snaps, I simply
transferred it to the computer, erased it from flash
on the camera, and proceeded to take another 50. And
yes, I didn't have to do anything to connect Parthan's
Canon to Debian, it simply picked it up on connection
and transferred the pictures - plug and play folks :)

I would also like to know as to whom at Arunai
Engineering College and NRC-FOSS I should send a copy
of the original images, each 512 KB. I shall burn the
images to a CD and shall send it through courier ASAP.
Kindly provide me with the address details.

Thanks,

SK

Hi guys: I am very happy about the grand show at Arunai and the very
positive  sentiments from all ILUG-C members. As you are aware, NRCFOSS has
the college interaction as a major activity and you (we -- well I am a LUG
member too!) are making it easy. There have been enquiries from a number of
colleges. Am sure Jaya Engg would like to up their ante. We also need more
shows to spread the word about the new electives, projects, etc.

Arunai guys themselves are keen to follow up. I have made them an offer --
to provide project ideas, initial reading materials and mentors. They should
do some decent projects, let us say by July, and make another big show : now
with their own "products". [The Dept of IT -- read Mr. Ravichandran -- has
already staked a claim to organize the event!].

I have also asked them to work out an event for the school audience. The
management runs the Jeeva-Velu International School and the schools in and
around Thiruvannamalai are the potential resources providing students for
the college. The AEC lecturers and students, assisted by LUG members can
manage the show.

By the way, Mr. Atul Chitnis had expressed a keen desire to be present at
the next FOSS show at Arunai.

As NRCFOSS member, it is also our responsiblity to help all other colleges.
Have asked the C-DAC FOSS team to join the activities. We could have a small
group working on the plan and modalities for the next 3-4 months activities.


Of course, you guys could come up with alternate suggestions.

Thanks once again, Srinivasan.

** Sakthi : you could send the photos and other stuff to me at NRCFOSS (
srinivasan@au-kbc.org) and to Prof Chellatamilan, HOD/CSE, Arunai Engg
College. Mr. Rajagopalan of CDAC is keen to have some of them on the NRCFOSS
portal and also publish in the CDAC magazine. You could also send a
congratulatory greetings to arunai@md2.vsnl.net.in  attn: Dr. S. Sridhar.
[He will ensure that it is flashed all over the college and more].

512 KB * 160 photos = 80 MB :)

Please send me your snail-mail address (in private is
ok), and I will burn a CD copy and courier it to you.

Can I just send the CD to the above with the college
address?

Whatever may the the numbers- less or more, this event reflected the
true community spirit that is hallmark of FOSS. It can be felt only
by the people who attended and listened to students - who were just
10 days back don't know what FOSS is all about. This is was brought
out during vote of thanks by a student as -

Hello ILUGC....

This is an OFF-TOPIC message

Thanks for your visit to Arunai Engg. College in Tiruvannamalai.
We had great interactive and informative sessions for the two days of
your visit here.
Now,people who were afraid of LINUX got rid of their unusual fears and
are ready to be a user of Linux.That was the level of confidence gain
because of your visit.
Now that i am a memeber of this group would like to get the best
possible information about LINUX and be a proud member of this group.

I hope my future mails will be of some use to OUR group......

Thanks again for your inetrest shown on us.


Regards,
Ajay.

First,
Congratulations on the success of the event.

Second,
Did ILUGC make sure that proper anchor's where "appointed" in the
college so that the good work on FOSS keeps continuing.

-- Does Arunai have a LUG ?
-- Are Arunai students/faculty on the mailing list ?

This might seem like armchair-activism but it's important that the
initial groundwork done by FOSS get's carried over into future
engineering batches at Arunai EC.At one point of time the college
should be self-sufficient for it's FOSS needs and should not depend on
ILUGC.Something like MIT.

Just in case you get me wrong - I'm happy to see events like FOSSE. I'm 
fascinated by the pains all the speakers & organizers are taking to

There  was a discussion in this thread sometime back on the troubles faced
by the bangalore lug - that it was hijacked. It is chronicled at:

http://kingsly.net/kingsly/Linux/bangalore/no-blug/

The abv is only Mr. Kinglsely's version. I do not know whats the version of
the other side! Anyway, Mr. Chitnis was one of the key players in that
imbroglio.

No judgements, no sides taken. Just FYI.

"appointed"? Looks too bureaucratic.
We introduce, motivate and help. Now it is upt students to continue.
One thing we were insisting was involvement of 2 and 3 year student.
Atleast 75% of over 50 volunteers are second year students.

You have a valid point.
The director and faculty told us that once their lug is formed, the
college will invite ilugc to conduct lecture/seminar.... once a month
for their students and also participate in the events conducted by
ILUGC.

Also they have a plan somewhere in July/Aug to do an LDD for schools
- jointly by AEC students and ILUGC.

1. It was created by the SSN college students for
their FLOSS discussions/events/promotions.

2. E-mail the owner, perhaps?

IMHO, some amount of bureaucracy is required from ILUGC side to push FOSS.
M$ does this in schools,colleges through it's "programmes".

Nice to see second year's involved.Catch em' young!

Good.
With each engineering college now having a LUG, ILUGC should take the
role of a umbrella LUG which links students together when it comes to
LDD's.

I'm looking at a point of time where college LUG's will operate
independent of ILUGC involvement.That's where the anchor's will come
into play and will have to pass on the baton to each successive
final-year-batch to keep up the FOSS work.

Engg colleges should not depend on ILUGC for any of their LDD's,IMHO.

> Also they have a plan somewhere in July/Aug to do an LDD for schools

Same as above.

Enough of rant's.I'll make sure I don't miss the next LDD.Though I'm
in Bangalore,I'll try and make it.

Thats true,
These days almost all the digi cams work with linux without any problem. 
I too was wondering whether I will be able to import my fotos in to my 
fedora 4. But, to my own surprise it openned up my cam as USB device 
once i connected it to my PC. In the LDD, the director of CDAC had asked 
some volunteer of 'Utility' stall about 'plug and play' features in 
linux. Hope, we could have shown him this ;)

Not exactly an email virus scanner, but take a look at:

Also take a look at:

I prefer Google groups, since I am of the opinion that Yahoo's groups
search feature sucks bigtime. LUG mailing lists usually have a wealth
of information in the archives.

   I tried both the linux 2.4 kernel and the linux 2.6 kernels. Both
of them return the same error.

Also which of the 14 disks are bootable(other than the first disk). I
heard that trying vannila kernel may help.In which cd is it available?

I believe, only the first disk is bootable.

This looks more like USB Mass storage rather than PTP..

Dear Linux Team,

I am working more on synchronization in kernels. 
I just have a set of basic conceptions in mind and I need clarity on few
issues. Please can someone follow up with comments on these lines below?

1) Sleep or schedule related calls should not be used in between
Spinlocks.

2) Is the interruptible_sleep_on_timeout() call based on timer interrupt
(or internal tick counter loop)?

3) Spinlocks have no effect on UNI-Processor machines. 

4) I guess interrupts will be served even when the spinlocks are held
except for spinlock_irqsave(). Am I right?

5) On a kernel compiled with preemption enabled (Multiprocessor), will
the CRT+ C work to break the spinlock which helps when I use semaphores
with interruptible support.

6) On a preemptive kernel, Spinlock() does not disable the interrupts
rather it disables preemption. I guess it mean, that if an interrupt
occurs, the ISR is executed and returns back to the same process
executing before it. If 
We will not have this to be addressed in 2.4.x kernels as the preemption
is by default disabled in kernel.

7) This is the case with all times of spinlocks i.e. spin_lock_irq,
spin_lock_irqsave, spin_lock.

Mukund Jampala

IMO, all FLOSS tech, ILUGC announcements, planning,
and anything w.r.t. to FLOSS should be in this mailing
list. That is why the emphasis on  a "meaningful
subject line". You can use ilugc-non-tech for all
off-topic/general discussions.

> Our group has

Bharathi and myself had asked Dr. Nitin (EE, IIT-M) to
subscribe to the ilugc mailing list. He did. He once
went out of station during a weekend. He came back
after the weekend to check his e-mails, and was
surprised to see his mailbox filled with ilugc mails.
He told us that ilugc has very, very heavy traffic. We
were like, "Welcome aboard" :)

They are different.

USB mass storage is a USB class specification driver
for mass storage drivers which is positioned on top of
the USB driver.

PTP is also a USB class specification - USB Still
Imaging class specification.

  USB mass storage    PTP

having been a member of both, this is my opinion: google is good for
"usenet" kind open groups like ilugc, where we dont know much about
the people in the group. yahoo on the other hand, is better for more
personal interactions, like say a group for college mates. google
though has very good search features, still lacks in features which
are required by the latter (polls, databases etc.)

By internal tick counter loop, are you referring to

"The kernel is a highly multithreaded environment.
Unless some data structure is private to a single
thread of context you have to do appropiate locking
for it.

No kernel code should be written on the assumption
that you will never be SMP, because kernel hackers who
got free, big, 64-way SMP machines will hate you
forever. And some locking is required on uniprocessor
machines as well. "

CRT + C? You mean Control + C? When running in
supervisor mode, the user doesn't get control/access
to kernel code or its operations.

Hi,

When I try to switch user from any non-root user, I am
getting the following error

[test@hostname test]$ su -l guest
Password:
su: incorrect password

Log file shows as follows

su(pam_unix)[5146]: authentication failure;

user=guest

There is no issue with password. I am able to login as
guest directly. After login to any non-root user, I am
not able to switch to any user. 

What would be the problem?

What distro are you using? If it's gentoo, the user needs to be in the wheel 
group.

usermod -G <existing groups>,wheel <username>

This issue has been fixed. The 'su' program in /bin
folder should have 'suid' bit in it. But it doesn't
have. Thatswhy non-root users were not able to switch
to another user.

Now I set 'suid' for 'su' program and its working now.

Yes, it's needed but I guess Spinlock will not help on UNIprocessor and
I may need to go for a Semaphore kind of thing.

My only question is whether spinlocks are valid on UNI-Processor Machine
or NOT. I guess they are dummy functions on UNIprocessor.

Check this, issue 
	down_interruptible();
	down_interruptible();

This will hand the terminal. After hanging you can come out of this by
pressing CTRL +C? It was woken up. I checked it. REASON is on interrupt
of keyboard, the all processes on semaphore is waken up and exited
finding that nothing is there to execute.

I just want to know, when using the spinlock, can we exit like this. I
guess NO, just because, interrupt will be handled and the same previous
process (as preemption is disabled when spinlocks are used) will resume
(spinover process).

Message-ID: <3AEC1E10243A314391FE9C01CD65429B3B4544@mail.esn.co.in>

Dear All,

I have read through the USB & OTG Specifications.
I have understood the USB OTG leaves very less to the part of Software.
Most of it is handled in the hardware i.e. in the el electrical and
mechanical characteristics.

But, I found that there was no clear statement mentioning whether the
normal 2.0 Device which is unaware of OTG can work with it.
(Assumption is A-plug is attached to Host and B-plug is attached Device)

I understand normal USB 2.0 & USB 1.1 Devices do not support HNP & SRP?
So, Can this kind Devices support OTG Hosts?
If I have a working USB Device & host firmware for a device, I will need
to add few things at the protocol level, request level & Dual role
handling.

Please correct me if I am wrong anywhere?

Regards,
Mukund Jamapla

i agree with benjamin. i am the moderator for the ilugc-non-tech. i
dont see any mails thro that. its better we make it to bring it live
again so that any event related things like demo, news, anouncements
can be made to ilugc-non-tech

general discussions about linux can be done here in ilugc.

I'll answer it as relevant to Linux.

It depends on the implementation.

Nope. You need Linux driver support as well.

No, it will not work. The normal host which you see is
a standard A female end. For OTG, you need to use
mini-A and mini-B ends. Re-read the mechanical
characteristics.

Yes.

You mean talk with an OTG host. Yes, but they cannot
do HNP or SRP. For OTG support, hardware needs to have
support built-in.

Yes.

There is already OTG support included in 2.6 kernels.
For USB device operations, check the gadget drivers.

OK.
If I wan to implement an OTG Driver, What parts of the specifications do
I need to read through? I guess I can neglect the electrical and
Mechanical and concentrate on HNP & SRP only.

I think, I can have a driver with does not do SNP and HRP and get the
OTG Host Stack working.
I mean I am will make more proper connections (Only the case when I
connect an OTG Device capable & a Normal USB Device) - So I don't need
HNP.
I mean I am will waste power - So no need of SRP.
This is not a good solution but I can get my basic OTG up through this.
Right?

IMHO,

1. Planning FLOSS events/demos and logistics for the
same is also tech related. Have you participated in
any? Else, you wouldn't know.

2. It is important to keep the momentum, focus on
contributing to FLOSS to this mailing list, be it
helping others, or planning for FLOSS events.

3. There is lot more work to be done "physically" in
the "real" world than split discussions from this
mailing list for the sake of an inactive non-tech
list.

4. If you cannot handle the traffic, move to digest
mode.

I repeat, this has nothing to do with FLOSS. I have

homework. Period.

Lets not kick off a flame war, Folks on ilugc mailing do understand

We_appreiciate_what_ever_you_guys_are_doing !! Kudos.

Floss events/demos, logistics are totally off topics for this list
which has few thousands of subscriber, having a separate mailing for
non-tech and other stuff makes complete sense for me, and enthusiasts
don't worry about subscribing to another mailing. they are every
where. Aren't you ?

Again, Contribution is something which has different meaning, for you
it may be speaking in seminar or a event, for me it a can be
"sacrificing a goat" to make GPL3 acceptable, so lets not discuss this
here which has a high volume of technical stuff.

Splitting the list is to make things more relevant not to kick
something out saying its useless.

Doesn't make any sense.

Deja Vu ... Ban?
 
There are lot of folks in this mailing list who are in
other cities, other countries, yet they *help* in this
mailing list "virtually". They help a lot of people in
troubleshooting, installation, clarifying doubts etc.

When was the last time you sent an e-mail, and when
was the last time you helped someone in this mailing
list, atleast "virtually"?

One fine evening, you come and make a statement, and
you would like everyone to follow it? I have never see
you or your e-mail, until now. I have no idea who you
are, and what you want from this mailing list.

Enjoy your freedom of speech!

Better things to do, lot of problems to be solved, lot
of people to guide with GNU/Linux ... move on, folks!

I'll stop my replies to this thread here. Period.

Message-ID: <32986.59.92.52.91.1143650796.squirrel@www.leatherlink.net>

I went to Arunai Engineering College only on Sunday morning.  From what
Raman had written earlier, I was somewhat prepared for the scale of the
event.

A prominent hoarding of Tux in the main market street  came as a pleasant
surprise. After years of seeing Linux only in niche mailing lists and
websites, it was a welcome change.

I spent the day at the database stall manned by 2 final year students and
4 junior students of Computer Science department.They had prepared two
pages of talking points,  a one page handout to visitors and two systems
with MySQL and PostgreSQL installed. They handled everything confidently
with their week long training.

 * They insisted that they are more comfortable with command line. * They
were highlighting the tab completion support in their presentation. *
They picked up minor points highlighted by any of the ilugc volunteers
and incorporated into their talk to the visitors.
 * The senior girls were bossing around the juniors a bit, pushing all the
talking to them :-).


In the morning, dozens of schools boys and girls were trooped around. Most
of them are in Higher Secondary classes. In my opinion, other than
registering the names of OS applications, they would not have carried back
much from the expo.

But, there were atleast half a dozen serious geeky/technical/academic
college students, who came to explore and went back with more conviction
about open source databases.  Some interesting discussions were around:

1. You people talk about source being open. Isn't it dangerous that anyone
can look at the code and exploit the weakness? How can our data be secure?
2. Windows is so easy and I am already familiar with it. What do I get
moving to open source?
3. Can I use open sourced code for my software and sell it as closed
source? 4. What does PostgreSQL do which Oracle can not do?

There was one guy from MIT who plans to do a project with PostgreSQL and
one ME student from Arunai Engineering who was interested in PostgreSQL
internals.

Overall, the commitment of the college's top management, efforts of ilugc
volunteers and the enthusiasm of the students made this a special event.
If this is an indication of things to come, open source development is in
for interesting times in India.

Hi!
I am a new user to linux and have installed Ubuntu 5.04, Hoary Hedgehog. I
am unable to install any program...teh following errors are popping up. Is
there any way I can set this right all at once or each problem individually?

    The gperf package is essential for building ivl from

How are you trying to install?

Use Synaptic Package Manager (front-end GUI).

Says it all, these are packages/tools that are
required to be installed. Try installing them using
Synaptic Package Manager.

Being a new user perhaps you aren't aware of package dependency. It's
somethng like that_dll_is_missing in Windows.

Use APT that will resolve it for you. As Shakti says, Synaptic is the 
GUI front end.

What you need to do is learn APT.

i agree that lot of physical work is there. but splitting the
discussion group does harm you?
check out some of the organisations how they organise so that a guy
seeking for help can choose his right mailing list
http://blug.in/lists
http://www.mozilla.org/community/developer-forums.html

I am not the one who doesnt want to attend FLOSS or any open source events.
I am truely open minded and i want to concentrate on technical rather
that attending the meeting/events. this is my view. yous might be
different in conducting event/giving out seminars.

i never said that i cannot handle the traffic. the non tech is created
exclusively for those mails which contains off topics and all. I can
say that all events/ or what ever u call other than technical
discussions are called as non-tech.

I'm not asking any one to follow anything!!. I personally believe
having a non tech list will be beneficial, its upto you guys to
decide.

I dont even find a need to tell you who am i, what i'm doing here and
why didn't i reply to any mails.
The only reason i replied is i dont want another "Atul Chutnis" to be
born in ilugc and for the benefit of ilugc. I love ilugc for its wide
technical discussion,

Find if you have glib installed. you can find it by using the default 
package manger with ubuntu which i guess is apt-get. Do read the man 
page of apt-get.  If yes.. find what version of glib you have. 
"glib-config --version"  will tell you what version you have.  "which 
glib-config" will tell you where it is installed. Make sure that 
glib-config is in your path.

Ma SivaKumar is forgot to mention his name in this mail :) He is one
of the main member behind the Zha Kanini Project. In this project, We
translated nearly 85% of KDE Strings to Tamil and committed to KDE
Project. He teaches Chines language in his free time.

TUX OO Tech Tip :-

When you create a template in OpenOffice.org and save the template
with File -> Save As -> Template, the documents you create from that
template aren't associated with it. Therefore, if you change or update
the template, the documents previously created from it don't receive
the updates automatically. Instead, the next time you open a document
created from a template that has been updated, you'll be asked if
you'd like the document to be updated as well.

That is very cool ... :)

Now this is something I was thinking about yesterday ... how do you
enter the letter of a different language into the computer?  Do you
use different keyboards?  Because, on this mailing list I saw people
post snippets of code in English with comments in Japanese.  Just a
wondering. :)

I presume this is during a ./configure . It means you are missing the glib, 
gperf and flex packages. use "Synaptic" to install the above packages or do 
the following

sudo apt-get install <package name>

Synaptic is a package manager. Also try to do a apt-get dist-upgrade to 5.10 
(Breezy)

For more detailed information on several HOW-to s on installing packages in 
Ubuntu visit http://ubuntuguide.org

For information Dapper release has been postponed to JUNE :(

most desktops have keyboards that you can choose. Kde has a 
provision of two keyboards so one can switch between tamil and 
english. There are two or three standard layouts for each language, 
and most of them are the same, so if you know devnagri for example 
you can happily type gujarati or bengali without knowing a word of 
those languages.

It might be the best ever redhat release, but its way too old and does
not have support for the latest hardware.

Hi
We are a company in resorts business  with around  200  systems and a
systems technical team of 15  people.
We are migrating to Linux and are planning to use Foss fully

In the process, we also want to contribute to Foss by initiating /
developing a few projects on our own.
The development areas identified are ( mostly addressing our needs)

1.The lack of a comprehensive sysadmin tool ( Webmin is ok, but is not
comprehensive)
2. Lack of  comprehensive and efficient documentation & tools

In the process,
A. I would like to ensure that  I am not re - inventing the wheel ( ie some
one else has already developed a similar product and i am just not aware)
b. would like to team up if some one else is they are half way thro in
developing a similar product
c. Would like to befriend people who can provide us with useful guidance ,
details and useful document/links to make the  development easy

Out of the 15 member team, thinking of deploying  about 3 people ( BE/MCA
with 2/3 years exp) full time for
foss development while the other team members may contribute in the spare
time.

Suggestions/opinion of this leaned group on how to go about will be highly
valuable.

With thanks

You're contradicting yourself here... if you are recompiling a recent
kernel and or a recent release of Xorg, how can it be the best distro
out-of-the-box.

In my previous company I was using RedHat 6.2--thats kick ass, and
would always pull up recent kernels and Xorg for latest h/w support :)

...until they started off on the RHEL track. RHEL3 is unmatched in
stability and security (possibly RHEL4 beats it, but I haven't played
with it yet).

This is a double-edged sword. I personally distrust any of these
"comprehensive" tools after some bad experiences with linuxconf (way
back in '97 or so). Their main problem is that they simply do not have
the manpower or resources to keep up to date with the vast variety of
software out there. For example, how many mail servers does webmin
support? sendmail? qmail? postfix? exim? courier? Even if it does,
which versions? Does it support sendmail 8.11, 12 and 13 (all three
very common on the internet)?

Recently, I had a chance to work on a "root" server that had come with
Plesk preinstalled. I tried to replace bind on that box with djbdns -
and ran into so much trouble that I have sworn off Plesk now. It took
me the best part of a day to make sure that this Fedora box could run
djbdns while maintaining its RPM database consistent. I blame this
squarely on Plesk - its inability to support djbdns.

> 2. Lack of  comprehensive and efficient documentation & tools

RHEL's documentation is really good - maybe you should base your
efforts on that. Tools - what tools do you have in mind?

Good to hear about this!

Instead of developing own (reinventing the wheel which is my view) try
to document the steps which you followed so that any organisation who
is going with smilar setup can follow this and setup with no
issues/problems. documents in the sense which version of OS u used,
what network setup u used, something like that. this kind of things
where people lack since there is a plenty of software to do task but
there is none to guide on how to setup a big network.

comprehensive in the sense? what do you mean by that? dont u think
webmin is not enough to  administering the system? ofcourse network
should be there for it to work.

i suggest that u can come up with good documentation.

 RH 7.3 is the best distro, out-of-the-box. Anything else requires
significant tweaking to make it work safely. HW support is not really
a limitation of the distro - you can recompile a recent kernel as well
as some userland RPMs to get HW support for anything, on
practically any distro. It's fairly trivial to recompile a recent 2.6.x
kernel and use it on a RedHat  7.3 installation - I used to do that
quite often, but found FC3/FC4  to be equally good and faster,
with some tweaking.

If you're doing a fresh install, use FC3/4/5. For legacy support,
YMMV, but RH 7.3 will work well in under 64 MB of RAM.

Dear luggies,

It is indeed painful to see, people see our physical activities as
wasting their bandwidth, time and considered lowly - probably like
the work done by officeboys, peons et.al. But world consists of - not
only ivory tower thinkers, but also lowly mortals like me who
practice FOSS. 

This is not going to stop us doing, nor reporting/discussing on the
mailing list of the physical activities.

If you want the ILUGC community character to be maintained and not
hijacked by few it has to be all encompassing -teach and community
work.

There is a danger - as happened to linuxbangalore - if you allow a
small set of people to do activities offlist. They may register the
ILUGC under law and claim control over it. 

Let there be only one list and only one organisation i.e. ILUGC.

I agree with sakthi to advise people to switch to diegest mode if
they find traffic toomuch.

Raman.P

I have used RHEL4 and it is definitely better that RHEL3 in terms of
stability and hardware support. Of course the EL versions also beat
their desktop counterparts anyday!

But Red Hat is rather for the newbie crowd. I am sure the developer
community would rather use Gentoo, Debian or Arch Linux instead.

Dear Friends,

I am the one who felt the need of non-tech list needed the most when some
off topic thread was posted and subsequently Mr.balachandar created it.
There were practical reason why messages of ldd planning/logistics posted in
the list, ilugc list is popular and any new comer subscribes only ilugc. For
instance Mr.Suman Adak for the very first time(he has not come to any of our
previous ldd or monthly meets and none of us had seen him physically).He
joined us and we had a good time of work at Thiruvanamalai. Now tell me is
that possible for  a new subscriber to join an event physically by going
through a non tech list. Even posting such thread in the non-tech list needs
a navigator from the ilugc mailing list which is not neccessary( my personal
opinion) instead of concentrating on the event.
More over non-tech list moderator never publishes a thread then and there
like what ilugc mailing list does.This is not to blame Mr.Balachandar , we
value his participation and contribution a lot , publishing it  in the
non-tech may take a jet lag in communication.

 I personally think the issue what we are talking will end in a flame war.
Lets proceed in the direction of promoting floss. I beleive each and every
one of the member in this list plays a vital role. Lets not raise the
question of 'whom you are and what you are? ' which may not bear any fruits.

?????????, ??????????? ?????? ???????????????! ????? ????.

With love,

Thyagarajan.

 Chennai LUG is much better that BLUG  just because we have very good 
*selfless* people like Shakthi, Bharathi, Raman.. and many more. 

Guys.. If you use proper subject tags.. then we dont need a new non-tech 
group, else we need.  I will post all non-technical mails with [NT] tag 
in subject from now on. I expect everyone else to do the same.  This 
will help everyone to create a proper filter.

We don't need new tags just use the plain old [OT] it is easier for
people like me to use mail filters.

  Where's the contradiction?  You can use RH 7.3, unmodified,
out-of-the-box, and it's the best distro ever. Or you can recompile the
kernel and some SRPMs for additional HW support or anything else,
and RH 7.3 is still great, and will probably happily run in 64 MB or less.

  OTOH, you can use FC3/FC4 on more recent HW, tweak it a bit,
and get a comparable user experience, with arguably better desktop
responsivity, at some additional cost in RAM (at least 96 MB) and
HD space. BTW, on FC4 it's mandatory that you upgrade gcc and
recompile Xorg, glibc, and lots of other stuff to make it run as
reliably as RH 7.3.

  Or you can start with RH 7.3 and upgrade selectively to FC3/4/5
and still have a small-memory install.

I guess Off Topic and Non-Tech are different.  Announcement of GLV is NT

Message-ID: <BAY110-F2079C7DF77DAC50FB7F5FC9BD10@phx.gbl>

Hi All,

Since I have been witnessing quite a few flame wars in this mailing list for 
the past couple of months I was very interested to know more about flame 
wars and googled.. :) Everyone must do !! [I recommend]

Some good links that I got

Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming

Flame Wars make Great Software:
http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2006-03-04-006-26-OP-CY-BD

Linus-TanenBaum Debate Transcripts:
http://dsl.upc.es/~docs/papers/LinusTanenbaum.txt

BTW.. It still keeps me wondering how  small topics [eg 'tech and non-tech'] 
could really go so much and turn into war of words [parthan's words] .. 
Human beings are great!!
I encourage HOT discussions.. Not FLAME WARS. Let them be on how to promote 
FOSS in TN. The best way to contribute to FOSS, Projects that can be 
initiated etc.
Will help in building a good community.

I know typing in CAPS means shouting.. This does not mean shouting but 
emphasis. Kindly do not mail back asking me to read the 
"MailingListGuidelines" :)


Let FOSS and PEACE rule the world.
Regards,
Aanjhan

Add [NEWS] for stuff culled from news and discussion sites including
slashdot and digg. How is [TS] different from notag - technical?

This is a good idea but let me tell you some thing, this will not work
*practically*. A simple [OT] is enough. If we started doing this tags
will be getting added more and more and everyone will have their own
valid reason for new tags. (Remember that light bulb story about web
forums). I'm not starting another flame war here this is just my point
of view ignore if you feel this is stupid.

For me FLOSS Events, FLOSS/Forum Announcements, Troubleshooting and
even Jobs are on topic for this forum. They don't need a [OT] or any
other tag.

i agree. from personal experience i joined bangalore tech list in 
2000, but was never a member of non-tech, consequently i never got 
to know the real nature of the LUG and the changes that were taking 
place as all that was on non-tech. Even today many people in the 
bangalore lists are unaware of things because they are not members 
of non-tech. We are building community here, not just technical 
stuff, and I feel very inspired watching discussion on organising 
things that goes on

Hi,

I don't see any reason for a separate non-tech mailing list. If you
call yourself a techie, you should be knowing how to filter tech mails
from non-tech mails of ilugc. If you dont know, then you are just yet
another n00b.

I dont think we need a seperate list or category for tech and nontech my 
opinion is 'the mailing list should be as friendly as possible
so that any new bie can feel free to ask any queries or suggestions

You mean automatically?  I would say its really difficult rather than
impossible.  On a similar note, even large technology organizations
are finding it difficult to separate spam from mails, and they succeed
to a certain extent only.

I agree, we don't need a separate mailing list, but just a way to
filter tech vs advocacy vs nontech mails so people that are interested
in only tech or advocacy can filter out the unwanted ones.

Very True.
This mailing list is a community mailing list and should not be ruled
with an iron-hand.This *is not* LKML.Any information/query w.r.t FOSS
is fine.

People who are on the list for the "tech" part and not the "social"
part should understand that this is a community list first and a tech
list next.

Btw, fragmentation of the list into [OT] and [Tech] doesnt work and is
not needed.
If you have something to say to ILUGC this is the *only* avenue.

Having a taxonomy also won't work.Do you want people to lookup a chart
of Subject-tags and choose the right ones ? Those sensible enough will
simply add a [OT] tag.

This is how a social community sorts out problems and evolves..
Students should see that in a pure community based system every
individual's opinion is valid and given importance.

In FOSS,there are no star-players, only star-teams.

I think it was decided long back that we will use just one list with
judicious use of the subject line. And that what to post and what not to
post will be left to a members discretion. Unless there is something totally
inappropriate -  when the list admin will use his powers. Having a separate
list for non-tech will leave many uninformed about ilugc activities -
especially when so much good work is being done.

That said, am also worried that something like what happened in bangalore
will also happen here. I do not understand why showing 'face' in meetings
and 'contributing' (a very narrow definition of contribution at that) to the
FOSS movement are basic requirements to even post ones views in the mailing
list! Surely, no FOSS manual says so!

I have had the unpleasant experience of a 'bar' challenging me offlist to
appear in an ilugc meet if I have the 'b****'! And I suspect there was even
an attempt to remove me from the list. I sincerely hope the requirement of
'showing face' is not to empower the 'bar' identify individuals and impose
his physical might on them!

 I agree. More rules will mean more transgressions. Personally, I dont care
what tag is attached to the subject. I just read it if the subject line is

There are certain assumptions i make here, which i find it true most
of the time ie, tag [ot] & certain keyword. By this way nearly 80% can
be filtered. If they can't taake the remaining 20% i don't they are
fit for a mailing list. AFAIK this is a decentt list where
nobody(atleast nearly) does spam you intensionally. Hence w.r.t. this
list it should fairly easy to filter. Further i would agree with your
view that spam filtering (though my original post is not related to
spam) is very difficult or immpossible. If you have used gmail then
you would know that they have filtered ~90% spam successfully, which i
think is a verry good rate for a free service. Hence i am happy with
their service.

 IMO, simply [OT] for anything other than  announcement, meetings,

 I don't find the need to use [OT] or any other tag there unless there
 are  tens of them in  day or week.

 Yea and [job] for jobs.

 If at all there's a  different list, would be good if it's hosted on
 the same server at IIT or atleast integrate interface to
 subscribe/unsubscribe  in one place. Perhaps, there should also be a
 subdomain  http://lists.chennailug.org (as most people do) to help new
 comers easily find all lists run by Ilugc.

 Honestly, while writing this post, I opened ilugc  website and it took
 me quite a while to find  "To Join the list follow this link" . The
 ilugc-nontech  google group is not listed under "ILUGC Mailing List".

 After all it's a wiki, I should have perhaps may be add it myself.
 But, I am not active and don't really know which is/are the official
 ilugc mailing list. As we do see some at yahoo groups. Anybody could
 create ilugc-something at somegroup/lists. Thats the reason why I
 didn't edit the wiki.

Hi,

I want to completly remove the parallel port support from linux kernel. What
I am doing right now is completely removing parallel port support in kernel
configuration in source directory. I compile and install this new kernel.
But I think there will be a kernel command line option to do this with no
need of kernel compilation. Is there any solution like that? If it is, how
to do that.

Pass "parport=0" to the kernel command line in
grub/lilo configuration file. For example:

 kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.21 ro root=LABEL=/ parport=0

Check Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt for more
options:
http://lxr.linux.no/source/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt

I have already tried this option and also parport=off, may be silly :-( .
But parport support is still there.

$ cat /proc/cmdline:
root=/dev/hda8 ro quiet splash parport=0

$ dmesg | grep parport:
[4294689.178000] parport: PnPBIOS parport detected.

But, have you tried using the parport after that to
see if it works?

Do you have CONFIG_KMOD enabled in the kernel?

Here is the parport related drivers:
$ lsmod | grep parport
parport_pc             35236  1
parport                35912  2 parport_pc,lp

Here is a section of .config showing CONFIG_KMOD enabled.
#
# Loadable module support
#
CONFIG_MODULES=y
CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD=y
CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD=y
CONFIG_OBSOLETE_MODPARM=y
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y
CONFIG_MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL=y
CONFIG_KMOD=y

Any other clue?

... which means you have it as modular (M) in your
kernel config. Since you also have KMOD enabled, it
overrides your parport=0. That's my assumption.

If you have the driver built-in (*), it shouldn't show
in lsmod.

My kernel config file:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/debian_t41/config.linux-2.6.12.3.txt

I have parallel port support built-in:

#
# Parallel port support
#
CONFIG_PARPORT=y
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC=y

By default, parallel port support is there.
 
When, I pass parport=0 to kernel line, it doesn't
create the /dev/lp0 device file, and hence I cannot
use the parallel port.

HTH,

SK

          try dselect command from the terminal.It itself will show
all the dependency issues.Then select all the packages which needs to
be installed .This is the simplest way to find dependency packages...

Also try to install using

apt-get -f install

If the header() function doesn't work for you (why?) you can try using
HTML's <meta> tag.

if ($someuser) {
    echo "<meta HTTP-EQUIV=\"refresh\" content=2;url=\"somepage.php\">";
} else {
    echo "<meta HTTP-EQUIV=\"refresh\" content=2;url=\"otherpge.php\">";
}

Here the value of content is the number of seconds to wait before the
page refreshes (and hence redirects to another location), and the value
of url is the page you want to redirect to.

the links here because they might be useful for people
who are working on GPLv3 awareness in India.

When the GPLv3 process was launched, there were only
two experts: Stallman and Moglen.  We need information
about GPLv3 to spread to every part of the world, and
we have a time limit, so hopefully the transcripts
will:

1. Maximise the reach of the work of the two experts
2. Provide learning materials to make new experts
(you!)

I also made a transcript of a short (25 minute) GPLv3
presentation which Richard made at FOSDEM in February:
http://www.ifso.ie/documents/rms-gplv3-2006-02-25.html

On the GPLv3 wiki, I've made a page for collecting
similar materials:
http://gplv3.fsf.org/wiki/index.php/Reusable_texts

And more info on FSFE's GPLv3 awareness work can be
found here:
http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/gplv3.en.html

When I made these materials, I informed many free
software communities in Europe because that's where
I'm active.  I didn't inform the free software
communities in India - I wouldn't know how.  Hopefully
others here who wish to help spread GPLv3 awareness
will find these useful.
