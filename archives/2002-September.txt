The problem is with su. When running su, the standard
input must be a tty (to read the password). su cannot receive
input from a pipe, or redirected file. Also, there is no mention
in the manual about getting the password from a file.

I don't know about RedHat. But in Debian and Mandrake,
the config file is in the /boot directory. So that should be
the place it is found in RH also. Otherwise it would probably
be in /lib/modules/`uname -r`

$ rpm -ql kernel-source | grep config

will give the correct location if the file is present

using the standard sysv style, rc.local is usually run last automatically 
- but it depends. for example, rc.local is usually not run for runlevel 1 
(single user mode). to see what your distribution does, look in the 
appropriate directory (/etc/rc.d/rcx.d where x is the run level). you do 
not (normally) want to start rc.local from rc.sysinit. rc.sysinit is 
intended to be run once on bootup. rc.local is intended to be run last 
after everything else is done, usually once per run level change 
(including once after bootup after entering appropriate run level). the 
following can be thought of as what happens.

(1) at boot up, rc.sysinit is run once

(2) next, rc (actually /etc/rc.d/rc) is called with the appropriate run
level, say m as the argument

(3) rc looks in /etc/rc.d/rcm.d, runs all the Knn files in numerical order
with stop as the argument and then runs all the Snn files in numerical
order with start as the argument

for a run level change (init m command), we start with step (2).

for the appropriate run levels (3 and 5), rc.local is run last by having a 
link S99local in the /etc/rc.d/rc3.d and /etc/rc.d/rc5.d directories (both 
links, of course, pointing to /etc/rc.d/rc.local).

xtra info: so, if you want to write your own nifty sysv init script for 
your own application, it is not too hard. just write a script that will 
take stop or start as an argument to stop/start the application. then, 
put this script in /etc/rc.d/init.d. then, create symbolic links to this 
script at appropriate places in the rcx.d directories. the Kmm link will 
be used to stop the application and the Snn link will be used to start 
the application. mm and nn can be set so your application will be stopped 
and started gracefully in the right place in the sequence.

Ummm, 10th August is over. :) 10th Sept. is not a Saturday.  So the
meet should be held on the 14th of Sept.  We are not yet clear on

But anyway i am not using pipe or redirection in my command. BTW, in
normal case it wont query for password, since the user is belong to wheel
group and all the users of wheel group are trusted. Again, if i run my
script from command prompt it runs fine as it is expected to (it wont
query for password). The problem is while running in crond. Any other
clue?

This feature is called 'backup' and can be disabled by using the vim
command :
:set nobackup

You can put the same in your .vimrc (without the preceding ':' sign (ie as
set nobackup)).

cron jobs do not take any environment setting from

environment variables like PATH,SSH_TTY etc. 
You may try by giving these

There is a separate package called ALSA (Advaned Linux Sound
Architecture) that contains drivers for a number of sound cards for
which none are present in the stock kernel.  You have to download the
alsa-driver package for your distribution.  (In the near future alsa
will be part of the stock kernel)

ALSA contains drivers for many ESS cards like ESS ES688, ES1688, ESS
ES1938, ESS maestro etc.

I would suggest you give installing ALSA a try and get back with more
questions if you run into problems.

Thankx for your suggestion. Now i run .bashrc before each command in my 
script but of no use. Still it is reporting the same error('standard in 
must be a tty'). AFAIK, SSH_TTY is set as the terminal number of the 
logged in host, not the terminal number of the host from where we are 
logging in. So in my case i suppose not to set that variable (SSH_TTY). 

Any other clues are very welcome.

Try  playing  around with the TERM setting. Setting  it to TERM=xterm, on
the client before the ssh may help.
You may also need to set the TERM on the Solaris server.

Let me know if it works out for you.

I would try the ALSA drivers for other intel cards -
snd-card-intel8x0.o that comes with ALSA and also similar sounding
drivers present in your kernel.

Otherwise, tough luck :)  You can try alsa-user@lists.sourceforge.net
for any latest developments.

It is difficult to say what is wrong with just this info.  Did you try
to move your mouse around?  Try pressing all the buttons (in turn) and
see if any menus appear.  Maybe you have wound up with an extremely
minimalistic config and window manager setup in which case there is
nothing to worry - only a little mod here and there to a few startup
files.

Please do get back with the results of the mouse experiments mentioned
above.

The problem is with su. Make the device mountable
and writable by a group and add the user to that group.
You can avoid su altogether.

It is always advisable to have backups.
Rather than disabling backups altogether, please try this.
Create a directory ~/.vim-backup
Add these lines to your .vimrc
set backup
set backupdir=~/.vim-backup/

The files would quietly reside in ~/.vim-backup
and you can use them when in need.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0209030018150.1213-100000@localhost.localdomain>

Dear friends,

Can we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source
Software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to
support their cash-strapped initiatives? 

Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study
of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea.

Jeebesh Bagchi <jeebesh@sarai.net> sent in this offer recently. It could
surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to
make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources. 

It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely 
workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger
initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If
such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for
greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like
ours. --FN


---------- Forwarded message ----------

The Sarai Programme, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi
(www.sarai.net) invites applications for Support Grants to projects in the
area of Free Software, Open Source Software and Social Usage of Software

Sarai invites programmers (practictioners as well as students) to

context, etc.

What is Sarai

Sarai is a public initiative of media practitioners and scholars looking at
media cultures and urban life. Sarai's interests are in the field of old and
new media, information and communication technologies, free software, cinema,
and urban space - its politics, built form, ecology, culture and history,
with a strong commitment to making knowledge available in the public domain.
It is a programme of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi.
For more information visit www.sarai.net. Sarai is committed to promoting the
free software and open source vision.

Conditions:
Applicants should be resident in India, and should have a bank account in any
bank operating in India.

These are support grants and grantees will be free to pursue their primary
occupations, if any.

Mail your project proposal, workplan and CV to both the following addresses:
<application@sarai.net> with a copy to <fred@bytesforall.org>. Please mark
your subjectline 'FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software) Initiative'. 
Also point out what you see as the relevance of your work, and how you
plan to share the resultant software once finalised.

Enquires: dak@sarai.net
Last date for submission: October 15th, 2002.

Note: Proposals from teams, partnerships, collectives, faculty are welcome,
so long as the grant amount is administered by a single individual, and the

I use putty to log in to my RH7.0 server. I've set terminal as xterm on the
ssh client. I get colours in ssh. If term is set to vt100 I do not get
colours. Further colours in ls etc is enabled with the --color-tty option

I did export TERM=xterm on the solaris server.  Did not work :(
I tried xterm-color and ansi-color and emacs refused to startup.
something seems wrong on the server side of things.

Message-ID: <FA3F4D4380B5D51186D600B0D0AAD2420267DE3C@ccr.satyam.com>

Hi All 
 I have an entry like this in a file which I want to parse 

#comments1
DNFAR1S query tli tcp /dev/tcp \x00020bb8a9f3702f0000000000000000

#comments2
PKG1S query tli tcp /dev/tcp \x000205c8a9f3702f0000000000000000


and put into another file as different variables like 

#comments
V1=DNFAR1S 
V2=query 
v3=tcp 
v4=/dev/tcp
v5=0002
v6=3000 // dec of 0bb8
v7=169.43.112.47 // (a9f3702f converted to decimal )

#comments2
V1=
.
.
v6=

How do I match this pattern  repeatedly so that I can create another file
like this 

Thanks for Reading through 

 Abhi

	awk is your friend here. It does a line by line scan and fields in each line 
are numbered $1, $2 etc. You can write these variables to a file in the 
desired format. 

For eg. 
The awk acript is 

BEGIN { x=0;}
{
print  "a=" $1;
print  "b=" $2;
print  "c=" $3;
print "End of record " x
x = x + 1;
}
END{}

#Input is 
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9


#Output 
a=1
b=2
c=3
End of record 0
a=4
b=5
c=6
End of record 1
a=7
b=8
c=9
End of record 2

Invocation is 
awk -f awkscriptname input_file

Hi

Are there folk on this list running bandwidth quota/management
software on Linux? Specifically, my problem is similar to this
guy's here: <http://shorterlink.com/?O22TJR>: DummyNet exists
on BSD but not Linux -- at least this was true ~2000-01.

c. 2002, Is anyone aware of successful DummyNet deployments on
Linux?

Subject: [Ilugc] pop3d lock
Message-ID: <20020904000030.62879.qmail@web8204.mail.in.yahoo.com>

I have a mail server running sendmail and ipop3d thro'
xinetd on rh7.3.My roaming users connect on the
Intenet and pop the server. Occassionally, users get
disconnected from the Internet while downloading mail
- maybe due to the call waiting facility terminating
data calls.

The mailbag is locked for a while and pop3d
authentication fails. This shows the userid/pwd popup
repeaptedly in Outlook/OE. If we shutdown the mail
client, wait for 10 minutes and try again, it goes
thro'. During this lockup period, when pins is invokes
for the user, pine reports mailbox is locked by some
other process.

The info I need is as follows:
1. Where does ipop3d maintain its lock files?
2. Is there any config file where this lock timeout
can be set.

look under /var/mail/<mailboxname>.lock if the installation is a 
sendmail server, remove that file for that particular user.

/var/mail/<mailboxname>.lock it may vary depending on the distro may be 
some time it is in /var/spool/mail/<mailboxname>.lock

Firstly, Linux is not an operating system. Linux is one of the kernels which the
GNU operating can run with. The misnormer got immitated and now this
entire GNU operating system comes to be known as 'Linux'. 

The GNU operating system offers you the freedom to use, modify and
redistribute it. For more information about GNU, its history and
philosophy, check out:

http://www.gnu.org/

and now for downloading/using a GNU/Linux system, you can try one of the
many distributions that are available (note some of them package
non-free softwares. be warned!)

http://www.debian.org/
http://www.mandrakesoft.com/
http://www.redhat.com/

(The question was for perl)

Read `man perlre` its got all that you need to know about regex in perl.

After you read even half of it, you should be able to write down your own 
code for doing what you wanted.

GNU is not the OS. "GNU/Linux" is an OS, there are also other GNU Operating

You are just being taken to another window manager (fvwm) or something 
similar. _Choose_ KDE or Gnome. Run ?dm (kdm, gdm, xdm) and choose from the 
menu which the simplest way to choose from one of the window managers 
installed.

Hi Luggies,

We have a couple of printers working off lpr in the lab. How do I
automatically account for the number of pages each one is printing (The
print jobs include ASCII, PS, PDF, DOC formats)?

Many of you may know Linux kernel developer Leonard Zubkoff (BusLogic
and DAC960 maintainer, among other contributions).  Leonard was killed
recently in a helicopter crash.  See
http://www.ktva.com/Stories/0,1413,163%257E6883%257E834332,00.html.
Leonard was one of the smartest people that I know, and I consider
myself lucky enough to have been privileged to work with him.  He will
be missed.

hi,

Am working on regional language printing support in Linux.

While searching thru Google for earlier work on this, I fortunately =
ended up in the below link of IITM

http://www.tenet.res.in/Donlab/Indlinux/printer.html

But the problem is the libind and the iscii2ps applications, provided in =
this site do not work for me. The iscii2ps function fails in the =
indian_init function that is found in the iscii2ps.c file of iscii2ps =
source. While parsing thru the code and if Iam correct, I found that =
this function is being passed with different arguments but the function =
is defined in different way in the libind library.

I would like to have the correct source of the libind library (If any =
one of you have, as the base work has been done by RECT, IITK&M) or =
kindly do provide some document that explains the algorithm behind which =
the iscii code is converted to ttf code. Or to be more precise I would =
like to know what is the data that needs to be passed on to the font =
variable that is declared in the struct tabl in the indian.h include =
file.

While parsing thru the code I found some comments with signature =
Bharathi and i believe few mails comes to this group from Bharathi of =
IITM . If you are the same person who worked on the libind code, kindly =
help me to find solution for this.

With Regards,

Hi
  we (bharathi and myself) are in the same Lab/Project. 
  For the iscii2ps, you need the libind.so library.
  so, you just download the iitm-term provided in the same website and install
it. It will install that library also, then you try that iscii2ps.

Hi ,

Any body knows how to build a relocatable rpm package ?

I went through the following link for building the package ..

http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-reloc-building-relocatable.html

The rpm gets built but when I try to relocate by giving the following

 rpm -Uvh --prefix=/usr 1234.rpm

the package does not relocate itself to /usr .

Any info on this would be helpful ..

Thanks ,

Dear Mr. Vasudevan,

I'm an admirer of the free software movement; a contributor I'm not since I 
have no knowledge about computers other than working on the glamorous GUIs. 
I saw your message a few days back at the "Ilugc" mailing list and also had 
a look at the screen shots. They were testimonies of great work and I 
wonder if you realize the impact of your accomplishment.

Well you indeed deserve a lot of appreciation form the vast majority of 
Tamils without good English knowledge.
The refinements of your work will be of use to a whole community.

If there is some help that you need with improving the Tamil front of 
Linux, apart from writing codes or scripts, do let me know. I shall be glad 
to know if you think that there is more for me to know on the Tamil Desktop 
area, I mean links to web sites and other reading.

I saw the Linux community give you pats on the back for the screenshots, 
but I felt that you deserve more for your work, that's why this mail.

Goodluck!

JP

Dear Friends,

It's a very good news that upcoming Mandrake Linux9.0
will comewith support for read/write with fullu tamil
menus. here are some cool screenshots..
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamilinix/files/misc/screenshots/Mandrake/


If you want to enjoy tamil, grap the 3 cd download
edition of mandrake9.0 rc1 today and enjoy tamil in
its full glory.

There is zero tweaking necessary if you choose, Tamil
as your language of install. OK, the install is still
in English. Otherwise the entire OS, including most of
the commonly used tools are translated. Later i'll
release an rpm with more translated apps like
gnomemeeting/xmms etc..

i can send the 3 CD's once the final version is
release to one person in India,who can take the
responsibility to burn CD's to others on cost-basiss.

I take this opportunity to request all of you to share
the word to your friends/family members and if you try
out rc1 today.

Full thanks/credits goes to Vasee for KDE, Dinesh for
Gnome, Pablo from Mandrakesoft. 

Regards.,
Prabu

why, it would be linux 7.3, of course; er.. i mean, redhat. ibm and hp
have been offering linux pre-loaded machines for more than a year now (red
hat). some months ago, i attended a show by zenith (or was that hcl?)
where they were showing a low cost linux machine. the target was to get a
machine that sells for about rs. 15k. they failed, but had a machine at
about 22-23k - amd duron processor, came with a customized red hat linux
cd (that could be used for installation/recovery like those windoze cd's)
and nifty apps like star office, borland kylix etc...

I was told Mount Road near Casino theater. should i go

i live near my college (T Nagar) so a reasonable

Subject: [Ilugc] lpr print pages accounting

Yes, you are right. A little bit of looking around revealed that it is
really easy to get the number of pages in a .ps file. Before each page,
there is an entry of the type:

%% Page: <visiblenumberofthispage> <totalpagecount>

grepping for this entry and taking the last entry's <totalpagecount>
basically gives the total number of pages in that ps file! A simple filter
bfore lpr would be enough for counting no of pages in .ps files.

ASCII is very tricky. One cannot know the no of pages bfore it runs thru
the lp filter. So, we have to parse the lp output, look for the number of
form feeds. A count of the form feeds in gives the no of pages. then, this
has to be redirected to the printer!

IIRC 2 things to note.

  1. The RPM needs to be made so its relocateable.  When I used rpm
  last this meant that you defined a Prefix: /usr or whatever upfront.

  2. Some packages are not easy to relocate as in the case when you
  need to put things inside /etc.  You cant relocate them so the
  package is inherently non-relocateable.  This is a possible problem.

Hmm looks like the URL you specify below mentions both these things
and thats about all I remember about it.  Maybe thats not what you
want but hope it helps.

	Your path is probably broken.

	Do a man fstab.

	Eep! Linuxconf sucks, and is very broken. Just ad an entry into
/etc/fstab. More on the manpage.

MS> can do that. and are there anyother tools like linuxconf that can be used to
MS> do things like this...

	Its an overkill to use those. But then again, thats just me.

a meeting every sat at 5.00 PM to discuss research issues. 
Our lab has lots of junta interested and who want to attend the lug
meetings (I havent attended even one due to the above seminar!!). Is it
possible to reschedule the lug meeting to some other time, say sat morning
or advance it by an hour to sat evening 3.00PM?

-----------------------------------------------------------------
DeveloperIQ "India's first complete software mag" Sept 2002 issue:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

	Highlights from the issue, compiled by FN:

	* Free as in freedom... focus on some alternate OSs
	  - SpinOS (an OS that blurs the distinction between kernels
	  and applications).
    	  - ReactOS: an Open Source effort to develop a quality
	  operating system that is compatible with Windows NT
	  applications and drivers.
	  - BeOS: contains advantages from several OSs without
	  ancient oddments of older versions. 
	  - Inferno: middleware, networking operating system, and
  	  a development environment for embedded systems.
	  - Gentoo Linux 1.2: High-performance ports-based Linux
	  metadistribution. Gentoo Linux has an advanced package
	  management system called Portage.
	  - Phat Linux 3.3: You can install Phat Linux on your
	  computer without repartitioning your hard disk.
	  - S.Ha.R.K: a dynamic configurable kernel architecture
	  designed for supporting hard, soft and non real-time
	  applications with interchangeable scheduling algorithms.

	* In the CD:
	  - SpinOS
	  - ReactOS
	  - BeOS
	  - Phat Linux 3.3
	  - Gentoo Linux 1.2
	  - Vita Nuova Inferno - netowrk operating system
	  - SHaRK
	  - XFree86 (freely redistributable, open-source
	    implementation fo the XWindows Systems)

	* Post your problem: Questions on 
 	  - How to figure out if your Ethernet card is recognised?
	    (itconfig netstat)
	  - How to access files on an MS-DOS partition or floppy
	  - What does it mean if your meachine boots, says LI and 
	    then freezes?
	  - What if you forget your Linux password?
	  - How to install GNU software in Linux?
	  - How to configure your network in Mandrake?
	  - How to create a 'multiboot' LILO in Linux?

	* Compile your own Linux kernel. Continuing the journey
	  with Philip de Groot. Concluding of a two-part series.

	* Look out for some database abstraction on PHP and
	  learn about the Perl DBI (use Perl to access many
	  different types of databases through a single API that
	  works independently of the actual database being used).

	* Ad for Borland Delphi7 Studio. "Provides the migration

Hi,

If I do a
rpm -qip xyz.rpm

it shows under the Relocations column the prefix with which the packet has
been built  and
which also means the package is already relocatable.

But when I give

rpm -ivh --prefix=/xyz/abc/   1234.rpm

the package does not relocate itself to /xyz/abc.

If i give
rpm -ivh --prefix=/binary    1234.rpm

I see that the executable is created with the name binary.

Does it mean that --prefix option is not able to create directories and
place the source there .
But accordin to "the RPM HowTO " it is supposed to create directories . or
does it mean that  creation
of directories has to be done in the spec file .


Can anyone explain this ?

Yes, the place that was referred to you is called 'Ritchie St'. However
laymen call it 'Radio Market'. You will for sure be able to pick up a
good deal of hardware. From T-Nagar you can board one of the buses that
goes to LIC. Get down at LIC and walk towards the tarapore towers. This
market is just right behind it. Bargaining will work too.

Good Luck!

Auroville, near Pondicherry and we have been running Redhat 6.2 set up by a

access) and sendmail doing the job. We wish to be independent and need some
help in this regards. Any tips on SMTP authentication is welcome. Auroville
is an interesting place to visit and maybe help us with our Linux setup.
Adequate compensation is part of the deal :-)

Hi ,

     any gui program for that matter needs an Xserver running in
 that machine or the DISPLAY variable set to anyother machine that
 has an Xserver running.moreover you are connecting from a windows machine
 which doesn't hv an Xserver by default.if you really want Xdesktop
 in windows try something like Xmanager (shareware) :-( .
or from connect from any *nix box .and u nedd to set the following

 DISPLAY=<any IP>:<display no>.<screen no>
 eg. DISPLAY=172.12.1.1:0.0
 and disable access control using xhost (man xhost for more details)


Happy hacking
Manikandan.P

Hi,

    X-forwarding should be enabled on the SSH server as well as the client
so that X connections can be tunneled over SSH.

Hi,

I am not aware of any commercial project (sourceforge is bound to have
some tool...have not checked), but I can provide u with MailEverywhere, a
software which I developed for our in house use. Works pretty well for
web based access...though some bugs remain!!

Hi ,

For all those who may try building a relocatable package in the future .

This is not possible with rpm version 4.0.2 (RH 7.1)

I tried the same with rpm version 4.0.4. (RH 7.3)

It works.

Thanks ,

try downloading and installing one of these packages then run your xwin 
applications by appropriately configuring your ssh client to forward X11 
packets.

Yes, thats possible.  3:00pm sounds good to me.  I do not know about
the others.  Do we need to vote on this?  If we can reach a decision
I'll update the site appropriately.  We need to do this fast though.

Prem, any problems with having the meet at 3:00?

Subject: [tamilinix] Mandrake 9.0rc1 first impressions



Hi Prabu Anand and Tamilinixers,

I installed Mandrake 9.0rc1 (on a Dell Inspiron 2600) yesterday. The
install went very smoothly with Mandrake's fabulously user-friendly
graphical installer.

The Executive summary: The Tamil stuff simply works: no tweaks, no
packages to install, no messing around with myriad config files.

Hats off to Prabu Anand and Pablo from MandrakeSoft for pulling this
off!

INSTALL
=======

1. Mandrake installer asked me for the default language. I selected
Tamil (TSCII).

2. A bit later, the installer gave me three choices for keyboard
layout:

- TSCII
- Unicode
- English

I choose default TSCII keyboard layout. In the next screen, I choose
the CAPS LOCK key (also default) to switch between keyboards.

3. After Mandrake correctly detected my graphics card and set up X, I
picked KDE as my default desktop and said yes to a graphical login
screen.

KDE
===

As I logged into KDE, I was greeted by a fully Tamilized desktop. The
desktop icons and menu items all were in Tamil.

I launced Kedit and hit the CAPS lock key to switch to Tamil and I
was typing away in Tamil!

No need to select even select fonts, everything was set up perfectly,
the first time.

I noticed that the (nedil) uukarams were missing from the keymap file
and the Ikaram was using still the TSCII 1.6 codepoint. I guess Pablo
used a older version of my keymap file. I'll have to send the latest
version to Pablo ;-)

Next I opened Konqueror. It started up with the Tamilized Welcome to
Mandrake page. I visited http://www.aaramthinai.com (a TSCII website)
and it loaded the Tamil fonts perfectly. (although, as the Netscape
flash plugins do not come with Mandrake, the site loads an annoying
series pop-up Windows trying to connect to the Macromedia site)

Then I opened KWord. Again, default font has been setup correctly so,
I can type Tamil without any setup.

I tried printed the KWord document and it turned up perfectly on the
printer. I tried printed the Tamil KWord document and it turned
nicely the printer.


GNOME
=====

I'm not GNOME fan. I'll leave it to GNOME afficianados to fill in the
GNOME stuff.

hi,

would anybody have the Mandrake 9 rc1 cds here in chennai? (of course would pay for the cost of burning) would like to install it and write about it. the fact that linux is out with the first complete, out of the box OS/Desktop environment in Tamil needs more publicity/needs to be written about.

i already have Mandrake 8.2 installed which has partial support for tamil. i haven't installed the keymap file for it, so the input is done only through the akaram editor. and more than half the menus are still in english.

anyway would love to get hold of mdk 9 rc1. regards, subash.

2001 TURING AWARD WINNERS SUCCUMB WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF EACH OTHER

	  New York, August 14, 2002 -- The recipients of the 2001 A.M.  Turing
Award, considered the "Nobel Prize of Computing," Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen
Nygaard of Norway, have died with two months of each other. The pair was
honored in April 2002, by ACM for their role in the invention of
object-oriented programming, the most widely used programming model today.
Dahl, 71, died in June, and Nygaard, who was 75, passed away on August 10.

	  Their work has led to a fundamental change in how software systems
are designed and programmed, resulting in reusable, reliable, scalable
applications that have streamlined the process of writing software code and
facilitated software programming. Current object-oriented programming languages
include C++ and Java. They are both widely used in programming a wide range of
applications from large-scale distributed systems to small, personal
applications, including personal computers, home entertainment devices, and
standalone arcade applications. The A.M.Turing Award carries a $25,000 prize.

	  The discrete event simulation language (Simula I) and general
programming language (Simula 67) developed by Dahl and Nygaard at the Norwegian
Computing Center in Oslo, Norway in the 1960's, led the way for software
programmers to build software systems in layers of abstraction. With this
approach, each layer of a system relies on a platform implemented by the lower
layers. Their approach has resulted in programming that is both accessible and
available to the entire research community.

	  "The work of Drs. Dahl and Nygaard has been instrumental in
developing a remarkably responsive programming model which has become the
dominant style for implementing programs with large numbers of interacting
components," said John R. White, executive director and CEO of ACM. The awards
committee noted that the core concepts embodied in their object-oriented
methods were designed for both system description and programming, and provided
not just a logical but a notational basis for their ideas. The benefits of
their work are not limited to software but are applicable to business processes
as well.

	  Drs. Dahl and Nygaard were professors (emeriti) of informatics at the
University of Oslo. They developed their object-oriented programming concepts
at the Norwegian Computing Center from 1961-67. Professor Nygaard was involved
in large-scale simulation studies at the Norwegian Defense Research
Establishment from 1949-60. He continued his work on object-orientation, and
did research on systems development, participative system design, and societal
consequences of information technology. With Danish colleagues, he invented
Beta, a general object-oriented language.

	  Professor Dahl also worked at the Norwegian Defense Research
Establishment, and joined the Simula project as an experienced designer and
implementer of basic software as well as high level programming language. In
1968, Dahl became the first professor of informatics at the University of Oslo,
responsible for establishing research and education programs in this rapidly
expanding field. His focus on computer program verification led to the
development of his theory of constructive types and subtypes based on
computer-aided concept formation and reasoning.


	  About ACM The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is a major

You can try POP before SMTP. It works really fine.

Message-ID: <20135.1031477552@www35.gmx.net>

hi!!!

I am writing a program to create dyanamic directories with dynamic webpages
using php. 
the program which i wrote in my windows box worked fine. i uploaded it into
the linux server which 

runs rh7.2. i was able to create the directory using 
  umask(000);
  mkdir($pathdir,0777);
But when i created the index.php file inside the directory, using fopen(),
the default file permission is set as 666, but i want the premission to b set
as 777 so that i can view the created file in my browser. i tried changin the
file permision in my php program, which returned an warning saying about
safe restriction.

i would like to know whether i can change the default file permission of
fopen which cms to b 666 or will i b able to change the file permission without
loggin in as the superuser, as the server in which i have hosted the program
is not mine.

thnx in advance,
R.Karthick

Subject: [tamilinix] new font download tool available

Hello all,

I have written a new font download tool (BASH shell script).  This
downloads all frequently used tamil fonts (TSCII, TAB, TAM, Vikatan,
Kumudam, Kalki, Murasu-Anjal compatible WebTamil fonts, etc.).  With
this I plan to address the following problems for tamil linux users;

1. Downloading fonts to read various pages one by one.

2. Installing truetype fonts and making it available to X

It uses GNU wget to ftp download all fonts at one go from my
employer's ftp server (real fast), use ttmkfdir to create font scales
and update fontpath with chkfontpath utility. (I have tested this in
few machines running RH and Mandrake, I will be glad if someone tests
it in SuSE and Debian and more).  I plan to add few more ftp servers
where I will maintain fontpools (any volunteers for space?).

The idea came out of Ximian Red Carpet for GNOME
(http://www.ximian.com).  I wanted to write some unified
downloader/installer for everything tamil (fonts, keymans, akaram
editor, Unicode editor, Vasee's TamilTeX package, Sivaraj's console
tools, atleast one Tamil Linux Howto.  This will make the life of
anyone willing to migrate to tamil desktop simple. First step though
is to make it work with fonts fully.  It draws heavy inspiration from
similar utility by Sebastino Vigna for Microsoft's free webfonts and
some similar tools for Debian.

It is available for download from
ftp://ftp.tamillinux.org/apps/TamilFontsGet.sh and the documentation
is at http://www.tamillinux.org/fonts.html

With this I have also made some long pending changes to
tamillinux.org site - listing some latest developments in Mandrake
9.0rc1, GTK2 VP modules of Dinesh, Vasee's kimaps, the Tamil Linux
Howto written by me, etc.  I just got the domain name and hosting
services renewed for two years (thanks to Mr. Maniam of iDNS.com,
Singapore). This has only 10MB quota and it is overfull (I had to
delete some old KDE rpms to make room).

I will be glad to receive feedback and suggestions on generalizing
this TamilFontsGet to a bigger TamilGet tool.

Hi Sudhir, Thanks for your postings. They are definitely useful and
informative. However, rather than posting only URLs, I would be personally
if you could also post a short one-para description of the information
containted in that URL. 

Some of us (myself included) have very limited access to the WWW. While
e-mail access is okay, we find it difficult to go online each time to
check out what the site is about. (Sometimes, the WWW4mail service allows
us to access the site without going online, and asking for a page via
email. But this takes time, and is sometimes unreliable.

Please oblige therefore, and send in a brief description. It would help us
to know what the site contains, before deciding whether we're
interested or not. Thanks a lot, FN

Hi all,

This time I've j2sdk1.4.1 and tried building jboss from source. But the build faild. This time I tried to narrow the error. Yes! the error is from a java source file build in the security package. 

I followed these stpes: 

1. tar -zxvf jboss-3.0.1-src.tgz 

2. cd /usr/local/jbossXXX/build/ 

3. ./build.sh 

...is something wrong with this. 

I'm getting error only when it tries to build security package. Can we try without that package. Sounds crazy..I'm not sure. coz of this I'm unable to run the server. 

This is a part of errors apart from warnings which is a stright forward error of undefined variable "module". do we need to any file for this?

hi,

Can anyone give me info on the feasibility of running old 486's with 16 mb 
ram (or slightly better ones like P100s with 32mb) as X Terminals connecting 
to more powerful application servers?

There is a howto on this at tldp.org but i want to know how many terms can 
be connected to, say, a P4 2ghz with 512mb ram for a reasonable performance? 
Applications used would include word processing, internet browsing and 
email.

And what does it take to build our own X-terms with the barest minimum 
hardware? Is the requisite hardware available in India? Forgive me if am 
over ambitious :-)

Oozing gratitude,

I can think of one way. Mail commands to some particular
address. Alias the address to a script which reads the mail
and executes the command. Care should be taken to see that
not everybody can send commands through mail. The mail may
contain some secret-code which is parsed by the script and
verified. Hope that helps

Dear President Musharraf

When blasphemy is a crime, religious freedom does not exist. I am sure you
value the freedom for people to be Muslims in countries which are not
predominantly Muslim. That is religious freedom. I hope you will lead your
country in repealing its law against blasphemy, and thus providing full
religious freedom to people who disagree with Islam in Pakistan.

For dynamically assigned IP addresses you should try using pon, poff
(dunno if pon, poff exists on your distro, though it does in debian).

wvdial is an easy to use/easy to setup tool too.

Connecting to ISPs is very easy for dial-up users, especially under Linux. The
way you have put your question, I assume that you have installed Redhat or
mandrake or some good distro that has KDE/GNOME et al (at least one of
them..).

Open up the KPPP from the command prompt and enter the details in the fields
as follows:

	Add a new account name,
	edit it, by adding new user names and the password. give the phone number,
and also teh dns server addresses, I am sure you have them.

	You dont need to enter your static IPs...  your IPs will be configured
automatically by PPP daemon.

you can also try wvdial under gnome if you dont have any KDE apps installed.

You need to configure ppp (a protocol to communicate over dialup
connections) and a user level program to dial out on your phone
line - like wvdial.

Try installing these packages and get back with more questions.

If you are using Linux with gui, you can configure this using kppp in kde a
you in Windows >> Dial up Networking. At the shell prompt, you can invoke
wvdial. wvdial uses ppp and chap. It would be useful to look up /etc/ppp
directory. I'm sure a HOWTO for this is available in tldp.

My set up is as follows:

Standard rh linux has a pppd script in /etc/rc.d/init.d. Look up
/etc/rc.d/rc.local file. This is executed last on boot up. You can put in a
script if you want.

Alternatively, go to /etc/ppp. You'll see a script called ppp-on. ppp-on
invokes pppd with ppp-on-dialer as the script. Follow this trail and you'll
know where to give the username, passwords etc. Once this is done, if you
execute ppp-on, you should an output that looks like

Using interface ppp0
Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/ttyS0 (com1 port as configured)
sent [LCP ConfReq id=......
rcvd [LCP ConfReq...... (many lines showing the negotiation)
sent [PAP AuthReq ....
rcvd [PAP AuthAck....
Remote message: Login OK
sent [IPCP.... (again a few lines)
Local IP address is .....
Remote IP address is ....
Script /etc/ppp/ip-up started (pid xxx)
Script /etc/ppp/ip-up finished (pid xxx), status=0x0 (if ok) 0x1 if abnormal
exit

You can put any shell commands in ip-up which will then get executed on
connection coming up. Similarly, ip-down will execute on link going down.

very much feasible. more than the cpu, it will be the ram and the graphics 
performance which will count. 16mb ram maybe too tight to run the xserver. 
you may come out ahead by using some older versions of linux which are 
much less memory hungry.

for these type of applications, cpu usage is quite low - typically, 3-5%
per user is quite acceptable. so, you can service something like 20-30
xterms with this type of machine. ram requirements are typically 30-50 mb
per xterm, but depends on the application. you can do a simple weighted
sum of the ram requirements of the applications to arrive at a number.  
if 10% of users run word processing at 50mb per instance, 40% run browsing
with 60mb per instance and 50% run email at 20 mb per instance, the
weighted sum is (0.1*50 + 0.4*60 + 0.5*20 =) 39mb per user (hey, i just
thought up some numbers randomly and it nicely falls in the middle of my
30-50 range.. honest...). leaving about 100mb for other system things, 
your 512mb machine can support about 10 users before things start getting 
tight/slow. if you want to be conservative, you can assume higher cpu 
loading (and go with one cpu per 10-15 users) and give more ram per user, 
enough to cover the largest application comfortably - may be as much as 
100mb per user.

you could put together a current model for something under rs.25k. get a
celeron motherboard with 128mbram (i would advise 256), a dax/dlink/compex
network card with pxe boot rom (better supported; may be harder to find.
netware boot roms are more commonly available), cabinet/power supply and a
monitor of your favourite size and you are in business. of course, this 
machine could be more than an xterm, since that 1ghz celeron is not a 
total dud. you could make a whole diskless linux workstations out of 
this...

and, there is no such thing as being over ambitious with this (or any 
other?) lug....

I think some thin client vendors like HCL and VXL have ready made Xterms
running off flash which would cost about 20K. Would be cheaper. I'd rather
buy old Pentium systems at about 4K, add a new monitor,kbd/mouse at 7K and
load slim linux on hard disk and run it off at 12K. Not a bad deal. You'll
probably get paid for taking away old machines that do not run current
windoze.

very much feasible. more than the cpu, it will be the ram and the graphics
performance which will count. 16mb ram maybe too tight to run the xserver.
you may come out ahead by using some older versions of linux which are
much less memory hungry.

for these type of applications, cpu usage is quite low - typically, 3-5%
per user is quite acceptable. so, you can service something like 20-30
xterms with this type of machine. ram requirements are typically 30-50 mb
per xterm, but depends on the application. you can do a simple weighted
sum of the ram requirements of the applications to arrive at a number.
if 10% of users run word processing at 50mb per instance, 40% run browsing
with 60mb per instance and 50% run email at 20 mb per instance, the
weighted sum is (0.1*50 + 0.4*60 + 0.5*20 =) 39mb per user (hey, i just
thought up some numbers randomly and it nicely falls in the middle of my
30-50 range.. honest...). leaving about 100mb for other system things,
your 512mb machine can support about 10 users before things start getting
tight/slow. if you want to be conservative, you can assume higher cpu
loading (and go with one cpu per 10-15 users) and give more ram per user,
enough to cover the largest application comfortably - may be as much as
100mb per user.

you could put together a current model for something under rs.25k. get a
celeron motherboard with 128mbram (i would advise 256), a dax/dlink/compex
network card with pxe boot rom (better supported; may be harder to find.
netware boot roms are more commonly available), cabinet/power supply and a
monitor of your favourite size and you are in business. of course, this
machine could be more than an xterm, since that 1ghz celeron is not a
total dud. you could make a whole diskless linux workstations out of
this...

and, there is no such thing as being over ambitious with this (or any
other?) lug....

Hi all:
i get your point ,but giving away source code ,docs  et al ,would it not reduce the sales of the product.Lets suppose ,even if there are bugs or problems ,ppl wont get back to the developer of the product,but anyone who undestands code may do that.
So ,the serivce industry ,may fall off.I undertand that helping the community is great,we develop great software and all philosophies.But does this reach a point where ppl dont want to write bigger softwares as the overhead in developing is big and suppose if we dont get proper returns.
I know iam wrong.the above whole thing drives to a singular point.A right Bussiness model for Free software,with which even *bigger companies can also partcipate in that.I am sure that even Gates's company has got the best of the programmers and design engg.I hope they keep to themselves because their work schedule does not permit them or may be they signed some non-dosclosure agrreement or whatsoever.
the point is nearly 40-50%  developers are not exposed to free software developing ,though most of them would like to do that.In our ilugc ,i have met many persons who write non-free software for corporates(almost 99%),though they find time to work on free-goodies as their passtime.
Which motive drives them to write what they love to do,only in their passtime but not take it up fulltime.?I think its due to the lack of awareness by company ppl about the free software and mostly they are afraid of thier bussineess.thats why i wanted to know about the BUSiness value of free software.there must be some bussiness designs build around this free softwares.
May be someone inthe group has an idea.
If u had come till here,thanks for reading .I really need an answer.

Hi friends,

Can anyone throw some light upon the bussiness model around the free Softwares(not opensource) and how can an organisation gain by declaring their Software as free software?Would that not lessen their sales?Enlighten me on the Bussiness value for Free softwares?

Hi all: 
i get your point ,but giving away source code ,docs  et al ,would it not reduce the sales of the product.Lets suppose ,even if there are bugs or problems ,ppl wont get back to the developer of the product,but anyone who undestands code may do that. 
So ,the serivce industry ,may fall off.I undertand that helping the community is great,we develop great software and all philosophies.But does this reach a point where ppl dont want to write bigger softwares as the overhead in developing is big and suppose if we dont get proper returns. 
I know iam wrong.the above whole thing drives to a singular point.A right Bussiness model for Free software,with which even *bigger companies can also partcipate in that.I am sure that even Gates's company has got the best of the programmers and design engg.I hope they keep to themselves because their work schedule does not permit them or may be they signed some non-dosclosure agrreement or whatsoever. 
the point is nearly 40-50%  developers are not exposed to free software developing ,though most of them would like to do that.In our ilugc ,i have met many persons who write non-free software for corporates(almost 99%),though they find time to work on free-goodies as their passtime. 
Which motive drives them to write what they love to do,only in their passtime but not take it up fulltime.?I think its due to the lack of awareness by company ppl about the free software and mostly they are afraid of thier bussineess.thats why i wanted to know about the BUSiness value of free software.there must be some bussiness designs build around this free softwares. 
May be someone inthe group has an idea. 
If u had come till here,thanks for reading .I really need an answer.

However, most ppl would either do it themselves or dont bother investing more. I think you are geting my point. If you know how to go about it, it is still for your advantage.

Can anyone throw some light upon the bussiness model around the free Softwares(not opensource) and how can an organisation gain by declaring their Software as free software?Would that not lessen their sales?Enlighten me on the Bussiness value for Free softwares?

How Free softwares can be used commercially?

     http://www.panix.com/~kingdon/writings/bizmod.html

Most of the people get doubts like that of yours that free software may
not be commercially viable because of companies like microshaft trying
to hallucinate people with articles like this:

     http://www.microsoft.com/mind/0599/flux/flux0599.asp

More on the free software philosophy:

Hello,
	I have a few questions regarding Bharti`s Zipnet ADSL service and would 
appreciate if someone could answer them

(1) How is zipnet generally speaking (Domestic package)
(2) How is the service
(3) Is the connection reliable
(4) Is it a good deal or are there better deals around
(5) Does the USB ADSL modem provided by them work well in Linux (Mandrake, 
more specifically)

Thanks for your patience.

Message-ID: <3D8020D8.7030606@qpackets.com>

......................FYI......................

100% tamil computer  
  
When will our parents and our tamil friends in tamilnadu see a 100%
tamil computer. Without even a slightest knowledge of English, can i
ever use a Computer?  
  
Yes friends, that day has come. Now we can use a computer without
knowing a word in English. These are the things that you can do with a
tamil computer even if you only know tamil.  
  
currently,   
1.you can send and receive e-mails in Tamil.   
2.Browse internet in Tamil.  
3.Write documents in tamil.Create documents for writing letters, books
and all other purposes.  
4.Print documents in Tamil.  
5.Maintain accounts for our family/shops in tamil.   
6.create nice presentations in Tamil.  
7.create and Share tamil documents with people who do not have tamil.
  
8.We can listen to music(mp3 songs)  
9.We can chat/talk using computer with friends using tamil.  
10.configure our own computer to connect to internet   
11.Add/remove software  
12.Completely configure your computer using friendly wizards.  
  
Do you really think all these are possible? What should i do to all
these things in tamil? How much does this cost?    
  
Yes, friends all these things are possible. And this is possible
today. And this is possible in mandrake-Linux. mandrake9.0 supports
tamil 100% out of the box. Pls. go here to see some nice pictures of
mandrake9.0  
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamilinix/files/misc
/screenshots/Mandrake/ 

If you're in hurry, pls. refer this document on how to get this
mandrake9.0 for yourself
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tamilinix/files/FAQ.pdf  
  
for others with some time to spare for tamil  
  
mandrake-Linux?  
pls. allow me to explain what is linux.  
Linux is another operating system like windows95/98/2000/XP.  The good
thing about inux is it is easy to use and extremely reliable and
powerfull. linux is free to use & it is legal to share with your
friends and is ideally suited for people like us in India. This comes
bundled with all the necessary software for doing all the twelve
things given above. No need to buy any extra software,  
  
Come on. How come your Linux is powerful and still free? legal to
share? 

Are you joking? 

No my friends, i'm not joking. distribution. This is developed by
thousands of volunteers around the world. This is possible because
linux is an open source software. Yes, in open source software people
share their source code, to enable others to find out problems and
improve it based on their own needs/ideas. This is how, some great
tamil people have worked hard in the past few years to bring tamil to
linux. Pls. go here to get more details behing opensource,
http://www.opensource.org 

Linux is also a free software, free as in freedom and not free as in
free lunch. This free software was developed as a protest again
proprietery software in 1974 and you can go here to get more details.
http://www.gnu.org 

Linux is distributed by many companies, and one such popular and
easy-to-use distribution that is focussed on new computer users is
Mandrake-Linux.  

mandrake-linux is a french company who focus on international users,
people like tamils, arabs. malay, chineese etc.. An extremely helpful
person named  Pablo Saratxaga  has been driving this and has taken a
lead to support Tamil In Mandrake-Linux. Tamil enthusiasts should be
really thankful this friend. 

Initially a tamil enthusiast named Sivakumar Shanmugasundaram started
translating KDE, one of the first graphical desktop environments for
linux. Later he was joined by people like Venkataramanan, Vasee,
Gomathi . Now, Vasee is actively supporting KDE. In addition Vasee has
modified a lot of open soucrce software to support tamil including
tamil keyboard. Without him, tamil would have never reached this stage
within this short time. D. Sivaraj is another great enthusiast and
kind person who developed console support and always helped newbies to
tamil linux like me in my early days.  

Dinesh has been working on the Gnome desktop environment and he also
has developed tamil keyboard for Gnome. 

Recently thanks to magnanimous offer of Sinnathurai Srivas, a really
brilliant selfless individual, Tamil got unrestricted free fonts. He
gave away his Avarangal fonts for e-kalappai, windows based tamil
software. He readily consented to give his font for linux. Without his
beautiful font we can never get Tamil support in Linux.  

with this tamil becomes the first Indian language to be supported 100%
out of the box in an operating system. A user who knows only tamil can
  start using computer thanks to mandrake9.0. Now onwards English is
not a pre-requisite for tamils to use computer. presently for
installing the operating system one needs english language. 

mandrake9.0 uses TSCII. A lot of people joined in to develop tscii,
the tamil computer standard . This is widely used around the world by
tamils. In windwos through e-kalappai anyone can read/write Tamil.
Pls. go here for details on TSCII. http://www.tamil.net/tscii 

Everhing you write and send in mandrake9.0 can be read in windows
using e-kalappai. for detals on e-kalappai... 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/e-Uthavi/files/ekalappai.htm 

how can i help? 
1. Help distribute mandrake-linux to your friends. People who know
only tamil will definitely appreciate your help. 
2.Help the translation of KDE, Gnome, Openoffice, mozilla.. a lot of
people are required to help vasee & Dinesh. This doesn't require any
technical knowledge. A simple English and Tamil knwoledge will do. If
i can do this, definitely you can do. 
3.Contribute more tamil fonts if you're font developer. 
4.Spread the message as much as possible as Tamil should leapfrog to
the newage. People like Kalyanasundaram have brought a lot of
literature to computer. We should read them and benefit from them. 
4. We should use computer for our day today life to make our life
better and tamilnadu a prosperous place.

Hello Ilugers,

I am an exchange student from Switzerland staying at the IITM for one year. I 
was member of a Linux user group in Switzerland (although I never invested 
really much time there). They are working on a CD for distributing free 
software that runs on Windows and are looking for others to join them. Have a 
look at http://gnuwin.epfl.ch. 
Anyway, it would be nice to meet you some time. Actually I think that I am free 
next saturday. I tried to find out where exactly your meetings will be held, 
but it's rather complicated. Is there someone staying at Couvery hostel ? So I 
could come together with this person ?

THE PENGUIN'S MANTRA: Efforts are on to find Indian language solutions to
GNU/Linux in the subcontinent that matters. 
Some call Indic and other South Asian scripts the final challenge to
computer vendors for full i18n support. It has taken its time in coming, the
challenges are not that simple, and successes have been few and far between.
Yet optimism is high now. Can this frontier be conquered early?
Technical challenges are certainly not few: the X rendering model is too
simple for Indic scripts (but an upcoming tutorial on the Indic Computing
site will have the nitty-gritty). Input for Indian languages is an open
issue. Most `keyboard solutions' available today for X are fragile and are
really more work-arounds than solutions.
Some say the principal problem is rendering conjuncts without proper
rendering engines and properly encoded fonts. Users want to type a sequence
of characters, and not concern themselves with the details of rendering. 
This requires fonts with appropriate tables giving the possible character
sequences and the glyphs for rendering each, and an engine that knows to
read the tables.
What are the varied initiatives are currently on in various parts of the
country. What could be the proper strategic approach? Which issues should be
tackled first? See an article http://www.freelists.org/archives/linuxinindia

FLOSS-SARAI INITIATIVE: No money in Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS)?
A new initiative might help to change that for some youngsters in India.
The Sarai Programme, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi
(www.sarai.net) invites applications for Support Grants to projects in the
area of Free Software, Open Source Software and Social Usage of Software

Sarai invites programmers (practitioners as well as students) to propose
projects in the area of free and open source software applications relevant
to educational, social and community needs.  We are looking for original
ideas, as well as proposals to localize and adapt existing software and
applications to South Asian conditions. For example - Desk-tops in Hindi,
Open Office and Gimp in Hindi. Lighter versions of desktops like KDE,
Innovations that creatively optimises older lower configuration machines,
Linux documentation in Hindi, games using local context, etc.

Conditions: Applicants should be resident in India, and should have a bank
account in any bank operating in India. These are support grants and
grantees will be free to pursue their primary occupations, if any.

Mail your project proposal, work-plan and CV to both the following addresses:
<application@sarai.net> with a copy to <fred@bytesforall.org>. Please mark
your subject-line 'FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software) Initiative'. 
Also point out what you see as the relevance of your work, and how you
plan to share the resultant software once finalised.

Enquires: dak@sarai.net Last date for submission: October 15th, 2002.
Note: Proposals from teams, partnerships, collectives, faculty are welcome,
so long as the grant amount is administered by a single individual, and the
funds are deposited in a single bank account in the name of an individual.

FREESPEECH.ORG, COMMUNITY SITE FOR LINUXERS: Himanshu
<himanshu_s@myrealbox.com> has something to announce: "I launched my new
site, http://www.thefreespeech.org which is basically a community web site
for Linuxers. Its main aim is "to initiate, collaborate and contribute" to
the linux cause. The site itself, is home to the ILUG-BOM's novel "Project
Resource Centre" idea, which will help ease the collaboration between
students undertaking linux projects and self appointed "mentors". I guess,
in the future it will also be home to dead projects, or very small
projects/scripts, which have not been (or are to small to be) hosted at
Sourceforge." http://www.thefreespeech.org
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

DEVELOPED-IN-DELHI ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE: Sudhir Gandotra
<sudhir@netshooter.com> announces that they've recently launched 'Kalculate'
<www.kalculate.com>, a developed-in-Delhi software. It was worked on using
C, GTK and PostgreSQL on the GNU/Linux platform. It promises to be the
"first financial accounting package on GNU/Linux in India and the
Asia-Pacific".
Incidentally, the Indian 'IT' magazine in their September 2002 issue have
carried the standard version of 'Kalculate'.  This can be used for
single-company accounting. The multi-company version, priced at Rs 10,000
(approx US$200), will be available to users of this version at Rs.3500 if
they register and place their order by 31 Oct 2002, under a special
promotion campaign, according to Gandotra.
Rajesh Kankaria <rk@coralindia.com> points out that he had also worked on an
accounting software developed on GNU/Linux around two years ago. But "due to
poor response I didn't pursue it further", says he.

INDIA'S SUPER-COMPUTING AGENCY GOES FOR GNU/LINUX (Reuters) : Aug 12 reports
say India's Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, which makes
supercomputers used for heavy-duty data processing, said it had decided to
use open source Linux software in a high-performance computing lab. The
Pune-based state agency, whose machines are used for advanced computing
functions in activities such as oil exploration and weather forecasting,
will use a Linux platform customised by International Business Machines.
"The selection of Linux public software and its deployment by C-DAC (the
centre) will provide a boost to the research activities of the scientific
community in India," C-DAC and IBM said in a joint statement. Founded in
1988, C-DAC is a state-run research and development firm which has built
four versions of its Param series of supercomputer machines. It also earns
revenue from selling Indian regional language software and by training
high-tech engineers. C-DAC's new laboratory will start operations in
Bangalore later this year, the statement said. "We are using Linux only for
a specific lab and have not yet decided whether to adopt it across all our
applications," R.K. Arora, C-DAC executive director, told Reuters.

SIMPUTER, LOOKING FORWARD TO IT: More on the Simputer (the commonman's
computing device, driven by GNU/Linux) from huiswerk345@yahoo.com, from Paul
Soetmulder, Encore Technologies (S) Pte Ltd :

Bad news: We only hand out limited number of SDK's (software developer kits)
at this point in time, to both customers and partners. We want to stay
focused on 100% success rate for all our customer projects, and we hope you
appreciate this approach. Our customers and partners do.

Some good news: Yes the project is moving "full steam" ahead and soon we
will surprise you with reference clients, available applications and other
news on a new dedicated website.

Some more good news: Yes many partners have already signed up to work with
us in developing solutions. Countries represented in our partner network
cover Japan, Asia, Australia, Africa, India, Europe and USA. We still have
some countries missing in each continent. Want to join this group of mobile
computing pioneers, its only one email away.

And more good news: Please note that all Encore Simputers production planned
for the months August/ September time-frame have been taken up. At this
moment we share to our best capability the units available among partners
and customers. Our partners and customers support this as we deliver the
solutions and benefits they need.

The best news for Partners: Also October orders exceed production levels,
although I have made reservations for "2 Encore Simputers" for next 100
pioneer partners" (in addition to 2 units for existing partners who have
placed their orders) for October 15th time-frame. First come first served.

Want to become pioneer partner, please email our CEO, Mr. Ravi Desiraju at

CDROM. You can read the proposal by Ajith Kumar here:
http://malayalamlinux.sourceforge.net/edu/proposal-by-ajith.html

It gives all details about hardware costs, advantages of LTS systems etc.
Says Baiju: "Now I am fully involved in Malayalam GNU/Linux Project.  So
that you contact Free Software User Group Kozhikode members for more
details. (I CC'ed his mail to the group mailing list). You can get the
latest CDROM from Rajeesh (ph:0495 355415) If you asking the the CDROM for
installing in any school, FSUG will give it you without any cost. If you are
from TVM you can contact me (just drom me a mail). There is another FSUG
group at Kochi (I think Raghavendra Bhat, a member of that group has got
that CDROM)."

survey but does provide interesting perspectives. I am planning to conduct a
survey/research amongst the `hackers' involved in the movement to trace and
identify the pattern of the development of free software movement.... I was
wondering if you could send me the list of the `open source projects' being
conducted by individuals/groups/organizations...I am attempting to create a

Thakur & Sheetal Chopra are doing a great job by serving the free software
community with latest linux distros at affordable costs. I got Debian 3.0 at
just Rs 50 a CD. That's real cheap and affordable as student

GETTING STARTED WITH GNU/LINUX: Some tips from: Trevor Warren
<trevorwarren@yahoo.com> who says these are good places were to start
learning GNU/Linux:
--> RH linux 7.2 Unleashed(Sams.net)
--> Linux in 24 Hrs (Sams.net)
--> www.tldp.org (Dos-Windoze-howto...to start with, the rest u can figure
out what u can read up and what interests you. I havent seen any classes in
Bombay that are worth it. Just stick to the books/sites and ask us when you
screw up with anything.) 
Trevor Warren is an active member of the Mumbai (Bombay) LUG.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

MAIL FROM AUROVILLE: From just next to India's own Little France, on the
east coast, the place known as Auroville someone <netadmin@auroville.org.in>
writes in to say: "Can some one suggest an easy to use web interface that
can be installed on a Linux mail server for web based mail access?? I live
in Auroville, near Pondicherry and we have been running Redhat 6.2 set up by
a Nexus guy with more than 800 mail boxes. There is IMP (for web based mail
access) and sendmail doing the job. We wish to be independent and need some
help in this regards. Any tips on SMTP authentication is welcome. Auroville
is an interesting place to visit and maybe help us with our Linux setup.
Adequate compensation is part of the deal :-) please respond, thanks."

MEA CULPA: Mita <mita@auroville.org.in> from Auroville has drawn our notice
to some errors in three paragraphs of the last issue of this ezine
(LinuxInIndia#5). Unlike mentioned earlier, Mukund does not live at
Auroville, but in London, and only visited Av during his studies at
Pondicherry University. He did not work for Ximian, Inc, and hasn't worked
on gtkhtml or gimp. There were other inaccuracies in the description of
Mukund and Karthik Ram (an ecologist, but not connected with GNU/Linux). We
apologise sincerely for any misunderstandings created. -FN

COMPUTER EDUCATION IN KERALA, GOING WHICH WAY?: Ajith Kumar
<ajith@nsc.ernet.in> is disappointed with what's happening on the education
front in Kerala. He comments: "Visit the site
http://www.keralaeducation.org/itschool/project.htm and find out how the IT
(schools project) has been sold of to contractors." Check out his
alternative proposal.

"In order to implement the project government certainly need to set some
guidelines regarding the objectives and quality of the program. This could
have been done simply by drafting a proper syllabus and insist on covering
that syllabus and also specifying the number of hours each student get for
theory and practicals. But what has been done is allowing few private
agencies to exploit the poor students and paving way to waste precious
foreign exchange by promoting the products of a Multinational Corporation."
Write to Ajith for a full-text of his proposal...
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

COST-EFFECTIVE SYSTEM USING GNU/LINUX: Ajith goes on to note that GNU/Linux
also has software to reduce the hardware cost by using diskless PCs.
Hardware cost of setting up a 10 terminal system is less than Rs 200,000
(US$4000) and each additional PC costs around Rs.14,000. The government, he
argues, should help the schools to mobilize the initial investment to
acquire this setup and in th long run every school will have a good computer
lab. If it cannot do that, it should not become a burden to schools by
forcing them to depend on a few selected agencies. By seeing the guidelines
it is clear that the motive behind selecting few agencies is not ensuring
quality but to open up another area for corruption.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

ON AN Ipaq: Trevor Warren <trevorwarren@yahoo.com> has loaded GNU/Linux on
an Ipaq h3850. Says he: "As of now, my research areas are localisation of
GNU/Linux on these personal access devices." See http://mlasia.mine.nu/ipaq/

SEE PICTURES IN CONSOLE MODE (FRAME MODE): Blinston (aka Asterix Baron)
who's email address echoes that Shakespearean dilemma <b2ornot2b@yahoo.com>
has written a small program called cjpg which allows you to view JPEG files
whilst in the console mode (frame buffer). Says he: "If anyone can help me
out by testing this program on various graphics cards and different modes to
iron out all bugs ... well it worked on my SiS530 with all the modes i could
try." http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ilug-goa/files/cjpg-0.1.tar.gz
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

PYTHON FOR SCHOOLKIDS: Says Raju Mathur <raju@linux-delhi.org>: Been
thinking about learning/teaching programming for school-goers and Python
seems to be more of the right choice than ever.  It's clean, well-supported
under both Linux and Windows, object-oriented and has a fairly large set of
libraries for basic functionality available.  Now if only they'd fix the
syntax of the damn language I may even start using it myself ;-)
Anyhow, I don't know if you're aware of the wxWindows project?  It's a
C++ graphical library which runs under multiple platforms (Windows,
Linux, Unix, etc) and, here's the beauty, provides a consistent
interface to the native windowing systems of the platform that it runs
on.  So a wxWindows program running on Windows would use the native
Windows toolkit while one running on Linux would use, e.g. GTK+ (the
Gnome toolkit).  Apps written in wxWindows thus have the look and feel
of the platform they're running on...."

NOTES FROM THE REST OF ASIA: Thanks to Bala Pillai <bala@tamil.net> for this
input: "The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time
zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino
psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident pyche. Folks who are
self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more time
diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and reechoing it.
Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing - we should look to
more symbiosis with them. Manila-based Miguel Paraz whom I have interacted
with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community.
http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key
Open Source catalysts in the Philippines.
KL,Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is another lead
Open Source catalyst in our timezone. Do look for symbiosis opportunities
there too."

Thanks for letting us know.  Are there others who'd be willing to do
the honours this time?

Anyway, the vote seems to indicate that many folks want the meet at
3:00pm.  So, this time we will meet at 3:00pm sharp at the Aerospace
department.  Unlike the past meetings I think we should plan on
starting this meeting on time (and also ending it on time).  So please
do try and come early.

I've updated the site and Suraj's script should intimate us soon.

[the microsoft article is here]

> >      http://www.microsoft.com/mind/0599/flux/flux0599.asp

well, actually, the mircrosoft article is full of untruths. the first
thing you will find at www.gnu.org is that free does not mean no-cost but
freedom. the basic premise of the entire article is based on this untruth
(and other such similar untruths). i dont know how many times stallman has
to say free as in free-dom and not as in free-beer. one of the truths in
the microsoft article is that software is different in that the
development costs are high and production costs are almost negligible
(more on this later). free software (or open source software) gives a
mechanism by which the end user can actually estimate the development
cost. to paraphrase the model "selling free software", developers of free
software are also free to charge whatever the market will bear. however,
you are constrained to distribute both the original source that you used
and the modifications you did in source form. it would be fairly easy for
me (the end user) to see that you have spent about 2 hours and that gives
me the leverage to offer you only two thousand instead of two lakhs for
your modified version. if, on the other hand, i can see that extensive
modifications and additions are in place, i will be willing to pay two
lakhs. once i have paid two lakhs, the question arises whether you should
charge anyone else also two lakhs; if there are, say, a thousand people
who could use these same modifications, should each of them pay two lakhs?
i have estimated your development cost to be two lakhs, but with that and
negligible productions costs, should each of these thousand people pay the
full two lakhs development cost? microsoft would have you believe, yes -
and that is how bill gates and microsoft become global money makers. of
course, this is in the spirit of capitalism, but the word greed also pokes
up its head. free software has been around for decades, but as long as the
alternative was the non-free software from ibm or dec or whoever (who did
not become global money makers based on software alone), it did not catch
on. i can see a parallel between the growth of microsoft and free
software. i myself believe that present software selling models like that
of microsoft are unstable and in a few decades, we will settle into a
model more like free/open source software. it is not as if there are other
'goods' that are somewhat similar in nature. take music, for example. many
people are willing to pay a thousand rupees to see michael jackson perform
- well, enough to make michael jackson also a global money maker.  they
can hear the same music (recorded, and perhaps, clearer) for much less,
they can see someone else perform the same music (almost as good), also
for much less, but it is the whole experience that people are willing to
pay for. and, michael jacksons songs will be seen as such by listeners
listening to other performers with their own cover versions. in a similar
vein, it is possible that the free/open source software model can lead to
a situation where software will be sold for something closer to
'realistic' costs. this also leads us to why academic institutions are
willing to follow the free software model. when prabhu has a research
problem (visualization of 3-d data), it becomes part of his phd program
and iitm is willing to give him his scholarship while he develops the code
needed to do this. once this code (mayavi) is done, the research problem
is solved as far as prabhu is concerned and also as far as iitm is
concerned. thankfully, neither prabhu nor iitm have a greedy streak and
so, mayavi becomes 'freely' available. both iitm and prabhu are content
with the name recognition of mayavi -> prabhu -> iitm. sometimes, it takes
more time, resources and effort to churn out something and then, some
commercialiazation is done. microsoft would like software people to
believe that free software will rob them of their livelihood - and thus
gather force against the free software movement; microsoft does not
necessarily act in the interest of software people, it acts really only in
the interest of microsoft (in the finest capitalist tradition). the free 
software model does not challenge the livelihood of software people - it 
probably does challenge the livelihood of microsoft.

Yes, Somu is preparing the list of designs, URLs, their prices. He will

"Linux server" is a generic term. Is the machine connected to the
internet? If yes, does it run a mail server software (like
sendmail/exim)?

mohan> to send mails to other mail ids which come under the other servers... my way
mohan> of putting up the sentences may not be too technical... so pls cope up...

mail is a mail client. It does not send the mail all by itself. It uses
sendmail to send mails. Hence it will work only with mail server
softwares which have sendmail-compatible interfaces like exim, etc.,

sendmail/exim/postfix-doc will definitely be worth a read.

Message-ID: <87vg5aweg8.fsf@shakti.homelinux.net>

I was reading a book titled "UNIX Papers: for UNIX developers and
Power users" edited by Mitchell Waite and published in 1987 by the
Waite Group and came upon the following passage. I felt folks on
either list would find it somewhat interesting.

/----
| As a basis for operating system development, the UNIX kernel has
| grown somewhat large and unwieldy (at least by UNIX standards), and
| it might be thought that UNIX system evolution would become more
| difficult, as new ideas need to be fitted into the old system.
| Fortunately, the complexity of the kernel has been recognized as a
| problem.  In one recent effort at recoding the entire kernel, MINIX,
| UNIX returns to its roots: the kernel is indeed nothing more than an
| I/O multiplexer.  The only functions that the kernel provides are
| process creation, Interprocess communication, and controlled access
| to peripheral devices, and the CPU.  All other activities,
| including, file system management, terminal drivers, network
| protocols, and so on, are done as non-kernel system programs that
| send and receive messages from applications.  The result is a new
| kind of simplicity and modularity that could engender an entire
| generation of UNIX system evolution, particularly because the
| sources of MINIX are so readily available, unlike UNIX sources

sir,

        thanx a lot for the long explanation you had given, the explanation
throws good light on the current market trend, but to promote free
software-concepts, what are the steps that have been taken, apart from the
gnu website or mr.stallman's speeches or the lugs all over the world,
honestly, i wudn't have known about this lug had i not tripped upon
linux.org, when an organisation wants to promote its ideas, dont u feel it
should also make its presence felt in the masses, the more the no. of people
come to know about fsf, the better. but not much is being done in that
front, although things are happening, and fsf is gaining popularity, its
real presence can be felt only if the man on the road can say that a
computer can work without the Microsoft Windows operating system... and
there are other OS's to do that...

        till then, i feel(thats just me) that however hard we try to
promote, only if we can win the confidence of the layuser, can we really
convince him that fsf's are on par with the s/ws that come with so many tags
and strings attached...
mohan>what wud happen if all
mohan> the software available were free and their source codes open... dont
u think

        and sir, by free software, i too meant what u had said....
thanx again for your patience.. if u can tell me what is being done to take
linux to the commonman, that wud be great...
hope am not taking u'r time and others,
cheers...

Mr. Mohan very clearly brought out a point that it is
not possible to promote any product unless the
layman accepts it. The notion that Linux is for 
geeks must go in order to promote it. Geeks should
start to talk in plain English.
Are we ready to take it to the masses?
Can we take Linux beyond Web, print, file and
mail server?

  RPM file for the VIM is available in the RPM dir of CD. Install
  using following command
  rpm -ivh vim-xxxx.rpm
  Read man page for more info.

lynx / wget read the following env variables to find the proxy.
Add this lines in ur .bashrc file.

export ftp_proxy=ftp://w.x.y.z:port/
export http_proxy=http://w.x.y.z:port/

hi,
I am using RH7.2 with linux 2.4.17 kernel. When I try to login to this
machine (with telnet or in system console) it asks for username and passwd.
Once I give the passwd it takes long time and then I get a message saying
that it is timed out.

So I have entered into the system in single user mode and enabled sshd. Now
I am able to login to the system with ssh, but it takes long time after
issuing the passwd. (It connects quickly but takes long time for
authentication).

In logs I get the following message
while logging in thru console
Sep 14 11:37:17 q-mac /sbin/mingetty[740]: tty2: invalid character ^[ in
login name

while logging in thru ssh
Sep 14 21:32:52 q-mac sshd[1308]: Setting tty modes failed: Invalid argument

is this the culprit. Does anyone know how to solve it.

Hi,
 
I am trying to get some kind of minutes for the Linux Users’ Group Meeting held on 14th Sept, 2002, at Aero Space Dept, IIT Chennai. Any inconsistencies/errors may please be corrected. 
 
Today’s meet was very punctual. When I walked into the room, finally, at 3:05, Prabhu was giving an introduction of himself. Today’s meeting was attended by roughly around 20 people, with many “freshers”. Of course, there were a few late comers. This includes an exchange student at IIT, from Sweden (a Mac user, who failed in his repeated attempts to install Linux on his Mac.), and a gentleman distributing a small brochure on kalCulate (an accounting package for exclusive Linux) and a few others.
 
-&gt;Mr Bharath gave a beautiful extempore speech on his project of Linux in Indian Language.
-&gt;Then someone gave a small talk or information sharing on securing Linux Firewalls making as good as hardware firewalls.
-&gt;It was Prabhu’s turn to introduce us to a beautiful utility for firewalls, LIDS.
-&gt;Finally Prabhu is offering to step-down.
-&gt;There was this discussion on promoting iLUGc to the greater masses. 
 
 
SUSTAINABLE INTERNET ACCESS FOR RURAL AREAS (SIARA???).
-         Bharath.
Bharath is in a very innovative and noble project of bringing computers and internet to the reach of rural India. Basically, we are looking at a computer, running on a local Indian Language, and at rock bottom price. The typical target is a second hand old motherboard with a TV out, and a regular TV acting as a monitor, amounting to a price of around Rs 4000/-.
 
Having squared onto G/Linux, as the operating system, for obvious reasons, there was this problem of delivering it in Indian languages. It had two major parts. 

Making it for the text console, and 
Making it for the X Windows System.
 
Note: Those who have used iLeap by CDAC-GIST might get a feel of what Mr. Bharat and his team are trying to achieve. But the difference, is they are trying to make it universal (for the OS) instead of being particular program/application. A similar project is underway (in terms of Indianization), at IIT itself, but at application level (refer http://acharya.iitm.ac.in for details). 
 
The grater challenge was to make it encoding independent and font independent. This is done by using suitable maps. Initially, this done using the ISCII codes as developed by CDAC. It can be extended easily for any code TSCII/Unicode, by suitably changing the map.
 
Making it for the console is done at the kernel level, so that all applications will work on Indian languages, without changing the applications (or with little changes to the text strings). This is done at three stages in the kernel. The input, the console (output) and the third one I forgot which.
 
When we speak of giving access in Indian languages, we are talking about a minimum of 15 languages, and more often, these should be transliterate-able without any difficulty. The greater challenge is that in Indian languages, a consonant and a vowel may lead to either half or one or two or three glyphs. Glyphs are just images/pictures of the text, as being rendered on the screen. A classic example as given by the speaker was the example of the Tamil letter KO, which is formed with the consonant KA along with O, but translates to three glyphs. Similarly in Telugu, we have 5 different glyphs for KA alone. In Hindi and Sanskrit, we may have two or three letters combining to form a single glyph.
 
What these people are doing is, they are trying to store each and every character as a combination of two bytes. The first part being the ASCII part and the second part is the ISCII part. The letters are stored phonetically, and are changed into the particular language only during the display. This gives us the flexibility of transliteration without any difficulty.
 
At the input level, whenever a key is pressed, the code is parsed by finite-state-automata, and the corresponding glyph is displayed/stored. 
For example, pressing K might display KA in Tamil first, and then if we press O, it may change to KO (three glyphs). All this is done using the finite state automata. 
 
Whenever the backspace or delete keys are pressed, the glyph being displayed under the cursor is read from the video memory, and the character being displayed is recogonized, and suitable action is taken.
 
For example, if KO (in Tamil ) is displayed and backspace is pressed, we should get KA. (which means deletion of two glyphs, before and after KA.  This is done by using reverse finite state automata. There was a small debate on why there should be two different automate. But the funda is that while keying in, key codes are being translated (using a map), to glyphs, and in the later case, different glyphs are translated back to keys, and the cycle goes on.
 
Thus these people have succeeded in making this thing work on the console. They have even made small changes to the text strings inside PINE ( a popular email program), and have given it in Indian language. There are ofcourse some problems of refreshing, which is minor.
 
As of the X Windows thing is concerned, there are three major parts in the system.
The X Server
The libraries
The Application
 
Here we are trying to modify the Libraries, so that the applications can work without any modifications. The difficulty here is that, we cannot read the cursor position at all, and hence, we can not know what character is being displayed under the cursor. At the library level, the cursor is just a LINE DRAW function, and we will never know if it is being called for drawing the cursor or for something else. More over, only the X Server knows to which window the text is being written into (using a display structure). Thus we have this huge problem of backspace and delete as explained earlier. They are now trying to get on to something known as XIM and XOM (X input Method and X Output Method). The process is yet to start off. Since they have a deadline to give a demo by next week, they are using a different approach for now.
 
Here, the input is taken by the X Server, and the key code is converted into different glyphs by the library, and sent to the application using simulated/mock inputs (not very clear about the terminology). But when the user presses back space/ delete, only particular glyphs will be deleted, which won’t look very nice, but for time being, works fine.
 
The input options available are inscript, typewriting and phonetic, the typing sequence has to be chosen earlier itself.
 
Thatz all I remember about the first talk. It was an excellent one, and more interesting as it was extempore. The knowledge of the subject by the speaker was good.
 
RUNNING PROGRAMS IN RUN LEVEL 0/6
Then came a small talk for a few minutes, on running applications at run level 0 and run level 6. 
 
What happens when we change to run level 0/6 is that all the scripts with the first letter as K in the /etc/initd directory (not very sure about the exact directory), are executed. So we have something like kinitd, kipchains etc… These scripts are responsible for shutting down the specific services. Therefore, if we rename these scripts, these services wont be shutdown. But there wont be any more userspaces/disk access. Therefore we effectively have the demons FTP/SQUID/… running  at runlevel 0/6. which makes the firewall as good as a hardware firewall. As there are no user accesses, (not even PPP), the system becomes highly secure. Well there was this debate of having a diskless system/ booting of a CD/… There was also a debate on compatability of the said procedure on kernel 2.2 and 2.4. 
 
LIDS
 
Then Prabhu gave a talk on LIDS for linux. LIDS stand for Linux Intrusion Detection System. He had previously installed LIDS in the IIT network. The need for LIDS came when he installed a firewall on the mostly locally mis-configured IIT network. He installed a firewall at his department, which connected to rest of the IIT, the internet and the department within. Thus the firewall was open to three networks, and so had to be made secure.
 
LIDS is a highly secure, and badly documented, system, which is installed as a wrapper over the kernel. Installing LIDS may be a pain, but that is the kind of price you pay for getting such a secure system. 
 
The G/Linux kernel basically gives around 32 capabilities for the user (root in particular). The capabilities of root are the main source of convenience for hackers. (administrators headache). LIDS basically denies most of the capabilities, and says, only specific programs have specific capabilities, and nothing more.
 
A brief account on installing LIDS includes getting the LIDS tar-ball, the patches, and patches for the patches, (search the internet/user groups as much as possible), then the kernel has to be patched, and compiled. Before rebooting into the new kernel, LIDS should be configured. If you fail to do this, LIDS will never allow you to do anything,  including logging in.
 
Installing LIDS creates a directory /etc/lids
It has the following files
Lids.conf
Lids.pw
Lids.cap
 
The lids.conf file is created automatically, and if you are not insane, do not touch this file. 
The lids.pw file is the password file, and stores the lids password using some MD180 RIPE or something like that. The password is first entered while compiling LIDS, and without this, you cannot do anything. Even if a hacker manages to get root access, and get to this part of the kernel, he needs to have the LIDS password for hacking further.
 
After this, each program should be given restrictions and exceptions, telling which programs should do what, and nothing else. The default is none is allowed to access nothing else.  For example we can say that only LOGIN can do SU, and SSHD can use BIND, which in turn can use port 22 only, and so on… The permissions specified may also specify up to which level (number of child process) that inherit the privileges. All these options are done using lidsconf command. The command is well documented, and more help may be provided by Prabhu, provided he is free.
 
What if, you need to use the system without the restrictions of LIDS? For this we have the LFS – LIDS Free Zone. This is entered by using lidsadmin (with some options), and entering the LIDS password. The beauty is that, the programs that you run in the LFS have all root access. But the child processes wont have any such privileges.  
 
We can hide particular directories/ users/services etc… using LIDS. The LIDS directory itself becomes invisible.
 
For this reason, some modifications should be made to all startup scripts to stop using the /etc directory to write logs, and change link /etc/mtab to /proc filesystem, and so on… Else u r doomed :P. More info on this may be accessed from LIDS.ORG, and also from Prabhu (if he is free).
 
PRABHU WANTS TO STEP DOWN:
Finally Prabhu declared that he wants to step down as the coordinator of LUGC. (How sad…) He is too tired of being the coordinator and keeping things going and arranging things for the past four years. He finds it difficult as other priorities such as completion of his PhD have greater priority. He welcomes people, young blood, to take up the position. Of course he will be in the mailing list and will be attending the meetings, but not so regularly. He will surely help us in getting some room for the meeting in IIT. Any takers??? 
 
CHIT CHAT:
There were these new comers to the meeting, who had come to know about ilugc, only within a week earlier. They were given a brief history of iLUGc, and they were actually here for that scheduled talk that got cancelled.
 
There was this new gentleman (sorry don’t remember the name) who was wondering if iLUGc could be made more active, by focusing on more “practical” stuff, and more commercial interest being included.. and so on. He said, he is not very clear, and he will give his suggestions in due course. He also wanted to have a system, an accounting system, on the same lines of the railway booking terminals. Dumb terminals, running Linux at the server, and having no fear of viruses. He is open  for all modes of getting it done. commercial / personalized/ GNU software (if any, already).
 
There was also a small discussion on the capabilities of DEB and RPM and the powers of the same. The discussion was mooted by Debian fans Prahu, Karra and others.
 
Mr. Bharath wanted to know if there are any lightweight office applications/word processor that would run on FVWM/TWM, without KDE/GNOME. He wants to add the same to his “rural computer”. Any suggestions?
 
This is all that I remember. If any modifications/omissions/inconsistencies/changes/… are there, please intimate the same.

Natarajan

Hi,

I am reposting the minutes of the meeting, as I found that the one which I sent yesterday was in HTML format and hence has created a few problems. Now am sending the same in text only format.

Hi,

I am trying to get some kind of minutes for the Linux Users’ Group Meeting held on 14th Sept, 2002, at Aero Space Dept, IIT Chennai. Any inconsistencies/errors may please be corrected. 

Today’s meet was very punctual. When I walked into the room, finally, at 3:05, Prabhu was giving an introduction of himself. Today’s meeting was attended by roughly around 20 people, with many “freshers”. Of course, there were a few late comers. This includes an exchange student at IIT, from Sweden (a Mac user, who failed in his repeated attempts to install Linux on his Mac.), and a gentleman distributing a small brochure on kalCulate (an accounting package for exclusive Linux) and a few others.

->Mr Bharath gave a beautiful extempore speech on his project of Linux in Indian Language.
->Then someone gave a small talk or information sharing on securing Linux Firewalls making as good as hardware firewalls.
->It was Prabhu’s turn to introduce us to a beautiful utility for firewalls, LIDS.
->Finally Prabhu is offering to step-down.
->There was this discussion on promoting iLUGc to the greater masses. 


SUSTAINABLE INTERNET ACCESS FOR RURAL AREAS (SIARA???).
-	Bharath.
Bharath is in a very innovative and noble project of bringing computers and internet to the reach of rural India. Basically, we are looking at a computer, running on a local Indian Language, and at rock bottom price. The typical target is a second hand old motherboard with a TV out, and a regular TV acting as a monitor, amounting to a price of around Rs 4000/-.

Having squared onto G/Linux, as the operating system, for obvious reasons, there was this problem of delivering it in Indian languages. It had two major parts. 
1.	Making it for the text console, and 
2.	Making it for the X Windows System.

Note: Those who have used iLeap by CDAC-GIST might get a feel of what Mr. Bharat and his team are trying to achieve. But the difference, is they are trying to make it universal (for the OS) instead of being particular program/application. A similar project is underway (in terms of Indianization), at IIT itself, but at application level (refer http://acharya.iitm.ac.in for details). 

The grater challenge was to make it encoding independent and font independent. This is done by using suitable maps. Initially, this done using the ISCII codes as developed by CDAC. It can be extended easily for any code TSCII/Unicode, by suitably changing the map.

Making it for the console is done at the kernel level, so that all applications will work on Indian languages, without changing the applications (or with little changes to the text strings). This is done at three stages in the kernel. The input, the console (output) and the third one I forgot which.

When we speak of giving access in Indian languages, we are talking about a minimum of 15 languages, and more often, these should be transliterate-able without any difficulty. The greater challenge is that in Indian languages, a consonant and a vowel may lead to either half or one or two or three glyphs. Glyphs are just images/pictures of the text, as being rendered on the screen. A classic example as given by the speaker was the example of the Tamil letter KO, which is formed with the consonant KA along with O, but translates to three glyphs. Similarly in Telugu, we have 5 different glyphs for KA alone. In Hindi and Sanskrit, we may have two or three letters combining to form a single glyph.

What these people are doing is, they are trying to store each and every character as a combination of two bytes. The first part being the ASCII part and the second part is the ISCII part. The letters are stored phonetically, and are changed into the particular language only during the display. This gives us the flexibility of transliteration without any difficulty.

At the input level, whenever a key is pressed, the code is parsed by finite-state-automata, and the corresponding glyph is displayed/stored. 
For example, pressing K might display KA in Tamil first, and then if we press O, it may change to KO (three glyphs). All this is done using the finite state automata. 

Whenever the backspace or delete keys are pressed, the glyph being displayed under the cursor is read from the video memory, and the character being displayed is recogonized, and suitable action is taken.

For example, if KO (in Tamil ) is displayed and backspace is pressed, we should get KA. (which means deletion of two glyphs, before and after KA.  This is done by using reverse finite state automata. There was a small debate on why there should be two different automate. But the funda is that while keying in, key codes are being translated (using a map), to glyphs, and in the later case, different glyphs are translated back to keys, and the cycle goes on.

Thus these people have succeeded in making this thing work on the console. They have even made small changes to the text strings inside PINE ( a popular email program), and have given it in Indian language. There are ofcourse some problems of refreshing, which is minor.

As of the X Windows thing is concerned, there are three major parts in the system.
The X Server
The libraries
The Application

Here we are trying to modify the Libraries, so that the applications can work without any modifications. The difficulty here is that, we cannot read the cursor position at all, and hence, we can not know what character is being displayed under the cursor. At the library level, the cursor is just a LINE DRAW function, and we will never know if it is being called for drawing the cursor or for something else. More over, only the X Server knows to which window the text is being written into (using a display structure). Thus we have this huge problem of backspace and delete as explained earlier. They are now trying to get on to something known as XIM and XOM (X input Method and X Output Method). The process is yet to start off. Since they have a deadline to give a demo by next week, they are using a different approach for now.

Here, the input is taken by the X Server, and the key code is converted into different glyphs by the library, and sent to the application using simulated/mock inputs (not very clear about the terminology). But when the user presses back space/ delete, only particular glyphs will be deleted, which won’t look very nice, but for time being, works fine.

The input options available are inscript, typewriting and phonetic, the typing sequence has to be chosen earlier itself.

Thatz all I remember about the first talk. It was an excellent one, and more interesting as it was extempore. The knowledge of the subject by the speaker was good.

RUNNING PROGRAMS IN RUN LEVEL 0/6
Then came a small talk for a few minutes, on running applications at run level 0 and run level 6. 

What happens when we change to run level 0/6 is that all the scripts with the first letter as K in the /etc/initd directory (not very sure about the exact directory), are executed. So we have something like kinitd, kipchains etc… These scripts are responsible for shutting down the specific services. Therefore, if we rename these scripts, these services wont be shutdown. But there wont be any more userspaces/disk access. Therefore we effectively have the demons FTP/SQUID/… running  at runlevel 0/6. which makes the firewall as good as a hardware firewall. As there are no user accesses, (not even PPP), the system becomes highly secure. Well there was this debate of having a diskless system/ booting of a CD/… There was also a debate on compatability of the said procedure on kernel 2.2 and 2.4. 

LIDS

Then Prabhu gave a talk on LIDS for linux. LIDS stand for Linux Intrusion Detection System. He had previously installed LIDS in the IIT network. The need for LIDS came when he installed a firewall on the mostly locally mis-configured IIT network. He installed a firewall at his department, which connected to rest of the IIT, the internet and the department within. Thus the firewall was open to three networks, and so had to be made secure.

LIDS is a highly secure, and badly documented, system, which is installed as a wrapper over the kernel. Installing LIDS may be a pain, but that is the kind of price you pay for getting such a secure system. 

The G/Linux kernel basically gives around 32 capabilities for the user (root in particular). The capabilities of root are the main source of convenience for hackers. (administrators headache). LIDS basically denies most of the capabilities, and says, only specific programs have specific capabilities, and nothing more.

A brief account on installing LIDS includes getting the LIDS tar-ball, the patches, and patches for the patches, (search the internet/user groups as much as possible), then the kernel has to be patched, and compiled. Before rebooting into the new kernel, LIDS should be configured. If you fail to do this, LIDS will never allow you to do anything,  including logging in.

Installing LIDS creates a directory /etc/lids
It has the following files
Lids.conf
Lids.pw
Lids.cap

The lids.conf file is created automatically, and if you are not insane, do not touch this file. 
The lids.pw file is the password file, and stores the lids password using some MD180 RIPE or something like that. The password is first entered while compiling LIDS, and without this, you cannot do anything. Even if a hacker manages to get root access, and get to this part of the kernel, he needs to have the LIDS password for hacking further.

After this, each program should be given restrictions and exceptions, telling which programs should do what, and nothing else. The default is none is allowed to access nothing else.  For example we can say that only LOGIN can do SU, and SSHD can use BIND, which in turn can use port 22 only, and so on… The permissions specified may also specify up to which level (number of child process) that inherit the privileges. All these options are done using lidsconf command. The command is well documented, and more help may be provided by Prabhu, provided he is free.

What if, you need to use the system without the restrictions of LIDS? For this we have the LFS – LIDS Free Zone. This is entered by using lidsadmin (with some options), and entering the LIDS password. The beauty is that, the programs that you run in the LFS have all root access. But the child processes wont have any such privileges.  

We can hide particular directories/ users/services etc… using LIDS. The LIDS directory itself becomes invisible.

For this reason, some modifications should be made to all startup scripts to stop using the /etc directory to write logs, and change link /etc/mtab to /proc filesystem, and so on… Else u r doomed :P. More info on this may be accessed from LIDS.ORG, and also from Prabhu (if he is free).

PRABHU WANTS TO STEP DOWN:
Finally Prabhu declared that he wants to step down as the coordinator of LUGC. (How sad…) He is too tired of being the coordinator and keeping things going and arranging things for the past four years. He finds it difficult as other priorities such as completion of his PhD have greater priority. He welcomes people, young blood, to take up the position. Of course he will be in the mailing list and will be attending the meetings, but not so regularly. He will surely help us in getting some room for the meeting in IIT. Any takers??? 

CHIT CHAT:
There were these new comers to the meeting, who had come to know about ilugc, only within a week earlier. They were given a brief history of iLUGc, and they were actually here for that scheduled talk that got cancelled.

There was this new gentleman (sorry don’t remember the name) who was wondering if iLUGc could be made more active, by focusing on more “practical” stuff, and more commercial interest being included.. and so on. He said, he is not very clear, and he will give his suggestions in due course. He also wanted to have a system, an accounting system, on the same lines of the railway booking terminals. Dumb terminals, running Linux at the server, and having no fear of viruses. He is open  for all modes of getting it done. commercial / personalized/ GNU software (if any, already).

There was also a small discussion on the capabilities of DEB and RPM and the powers of the same. The discussion was mooted by Debian fans Prahu, Karra and others.

Mr. Bharath wanted to know if there are any lightweight office applications/word processor that would run on FVWM/TWM, without KDE/GNOME. He wants to add the same to his “rural computer”. Any suggestions?

This is all that I remember. If any modifications/omissions/inconsistencies/changes/… are there, please intimate the same.

I'd like to step down from co-ordinatorship.  I have a little too much
to do and have had this job for a long while and can no longer
continue to have this administrative responsibility of handling
meetings every month or every two weeks.  I'll still remain the
mailing list admin and will lurk on the list and might attend the
occasional meet.  If there is a need to organize for a room to be open
in the Aero department I'll see if I can get a friend/junior to help
with that but it wont be me that makes the announcements, decides and
organizes for the room and play "host" (I mean introducing the
speakers fixing agenda etc.) to the meet itself.

cheers,
prabhu

Its been fun attending meets with prabhu there..he always has an
interesting point of view and encouraged others to express their
opinions.. you will sure be missed.

But this is a good oppurtunity for others to take on the mantel of the
ilugc host. its a very good 'character building' role !! Also, you will
get to interact, control(loose-control ?), of ,many more interesting
'characters' like Ravi Rao...well, atleast future Ravi Raos' -- you know
the saying... history repeats .... ;)

have fun prabhu..

Hi nataraj!

 u really did a great job.it was me who gave the small  talk on Halted firewall and there is a small correction in  ur minutes,
u had written

>FTP/SQUID/? running  at runlevel 0/6."

  this is not possible in that state as all the filesystems are unmounted.FTP , SQUID are userpace apps .In that state the box will act as a forwarder and u can do all sorts of firewalling stuff.(SNATing,DNATing,MASQUERADING,MANGLING,etc).

Thanx once again

Subject: [Ilugc] Minutes of the meeting

Hi,
 
I am trying to get some kind of minutes for the Linux Users? Group Meeting held on 14th Sept, 2002, at Aero Space Dept, IIT Chennai. Any inconsistencies/errors may please be corrected. 
 
Today?s meet was very punctual. When I walked into the room, finally, at 3:05, Prabhu was giving an introduction of himself. Today?s meeting was attended by roughly around 20 people, with many ?freshers?. Of course, there were a few late comers. This includes an exchange student at IIT, from Sweden (a Mac user, who failed in his repeated attempts to install Linux on his Mac.), and a gentleman distributing a small brochure on kalCulate (an accounting package for exclusive Linux) and a few others.
 
->Mr Bharath gave a beautiful extempore speech on his project of Linux in Indian Language.
->Then someone gave a small talk or information sharing on securing Linux Firewalls making as good as hardware firewalls.
->It was Prabhu?s turn to introduce us to a beautiful utility for firewalls, LIDS.
->Finally Prabhu is offering to step-down.
->There was this discussion on promoting iLUGc to the greater masses. 
 
 
SUSTAINABLE INTERNET ACCESS FOR RURAL AREAS (SIARA???).
-         Bharath.
Bharath is in a very innovative and noble project of bringing computers and internet to the reach of rural India. Basically, we are looking at a computer, running on a local Indian Language, and at rock bottom price. The typical target is a second hand old motherboard with a TV out, and a regular TV acting as a monitor, amounting to a price of around Rs 4000/-.
 
Having squared onto G/Linux, as the operating system, for obvious reasons, there was this problem of delivering it in Indian languages. It had two major parts. 

Making it for the text console, and 
Making it for the X Windows System.
 
Note: Those who have used iLeap by CDAC-GIST might get a feel of what Mr. Bharat and his team are trying to achieve. But the difference, is they are trying to make it universal (for the OS) instead of being particular program/application. A similar project is underway (in terms of Indianization), at IIT itself, but at application level (refer http://acharya.iitm.ac.in for details). 
 
The grater challenge was to make it encoding independent and font independent. This is done by using suitable maps. Initially, this done using the ISCII codes as developed by CDAC. It can be extended easily for any code TSCII/Unicode, by suitably changing the map.
 
Making it for the console is done at the kernel level, so that all applications will work on Indian languages, without changing the applications (or with little changes to the text strings). This is done at three stages in the kernel. The input, the console (output) and the third one I forgot which.
 
When we speak of giving access in Indian languages, we are talking about a minimum of 15 languages, and more often, these should be transliterate-able without any difficulty. The greater challenge is that in Indian languages, a consonant and a vowel may lead to either half or one or two or three glyphs. Glyphs are just images/pictures of the text, as being rendered on the screen. A classic example as given by the speaker was the example of the Tamil letter KO, which is formed with the consonant KA along with O, but translates to three glyphs. Similarly in Telugu, we have 5 different glyphs for KA alone. In Hindi and Sanskrit, we may have two or three letters combining to form a single glyph.
 
What these people are doing is, they are trying to store each and every character as a combination of two bytes. The first part being the ASCII part and the second part is the ISCII part. The letters are stored phonetically, and are changed into the particular language only during the display. This gives us the flexibility of transliteration without any difficulty.
 
At the input level, whenever a key is pressed, the code is parsed by finite-state-automata, and the corresponding glyph is displayed/stored. 
For example, pressing K might display KA in Tamil first, and then if we press O, it may change to KO (three glyphs). All this is done using the finite state automata. 
 
Whenever the backspace or delete keys are pressed, the glyph being displayed under the cursor is read from the video memory, and the character being displayed is recogonized, and suitable action is taken.
 
For example, if KO (in Tamil ) is displayed and backspace is pressed, we should get KA. (which means deletion of two glyphs, before and after KA.  This is done by using reverse finite state automata. There was a small debate on why there should be two different automate. But the funda is that while keying in, key codes are being translated (using a map), to glyphs, and in the later case, different glyphs are translated back to keys, and the cycle goes on.
 
Thus these people have succeeded in making this thing work on the console. They have even made small changes to the text strings inside PINE ( a popular email program), and have given it in Indian language. There are ofcourse some problems of refreshing, which is minor.
 
As of the X Windows thing is concerned, there are three major parts in the system.
The X Server
The libraries
The Application
 
Here we are trying to modify the Libraries, so that the applications can work without any modifications. The difficulty here is that, we cannot read the cursor position at all, and hence, we can not know what character is being displayed under the cursor. At the library level, the cursor is just a LINE DRAW function, and we will never know if it is being called for drawing the cursor or for something else. More over, only the X Server knows to which window the text is being written into (using a display structure). Thus we have this huge problem of backspace and delete as explained earlier. They are now trying to get on to something known as XIM and XOM (X input Method and X Output Method). The process is yet to start off. Since they have a deadline to give a demo by next week, they are using a different approach for now.
 
Here, the input is taken by the X Server, and the key code is converted into different glyphs by the library, and sent to the application using simulated/mock inputs (not very clear about the terminology). But when the user presses back space/ delete, only particular glyphs will be deleted, which won?t look very nice, but for time being, works fine.
 
The input options available are inscript, typewriting and phonetic, the typing sequence has to be chosen earlier itself.
 
Thatz all I remember about the first talk. It was an excellent one, and more interesting as it was extempore. The knowledge of the subject by the speaker was good.
 
RUNNING PROGRAMS IN RUN LEVEL 0/6
Then came a small talk for a few minutes, on running applications at run level 0 and run level 6. 
 
What happens when we change to run level 0/6 is that all the scripts with the first letter as K in the /etc/initd directory (not very sure about the exact directory), are executed. So we have something like kinitd, kipchains etc? These scripts are responsible for shutting down the specific services. Therefore, if we rename these scripts, these services wont be shutdown. But there wont be any more userspaces/disk access. Therefore we effectively have the demons FTP/SQUID/? running  at runlevel 0/6. which makes the firewall as good as a hardware firewall. As there are no user accesses, (not even PPP), the system becomes highly secure. Well there was this debate of having a diskless system/ booting of a CD/? There was also a debate on compatability of the said procedure on kernel 2.2 and 2.4. 
 
LIDS
 
Then Prabhu gave a talk on LIDS for linux. LIDS stand for Linux Intrusion Detection System. He had previously installed LIDS in the IIT network. The need for LIDS came when he installed a firewall on the mostly locally mis-configured IIT network. He installed a firewall at his department, which connected to rest of the IIT, the internet and the department within. Thus the firewall was open to three networks, and so had to be made secure.
 
LIDS is a highly secure, and badly documented, system, which is installed as a wrapper over the kernel. Installing LIDS may be a pain, but that is the kind of price you pay for getting such a secure system. 
 
The G/Linux kernel basically gives around 32 capabilities for the user (root in particular). The capabilities of root are the main source of convenience for hackers. (administrators headache). LIDS basically denies most of the capabilities, and says, only specific programs have specific capabilities, and nothing more.
 
A brief account on installing LIDS includes getting the LIDS tar-ball, the patches, and patches for the patches, (search the internet/user groups as much as possible), then the kernel has to be patched, and compiled. Before rebooting into the new kernel, LIDS should be configured. If you fail to do this, LIDS will never allow you to do anything,  including logging in.
 
Installing LIDS creates a directory /etc/lids
It has the following files
Lids.conf
Lids.pw
Lids.cap
 
The lids.conf file is created automatically, and if you are not insane, do not touch this file. 
The lids.pw file is the password file, and stores the lids password using some MD180 RIPE or something like that. The password is first entered while compiling LIDS, and without this, you cannot do anything. Even if a hacker manages to get root access, and get to this part of the kernel, he needs to have the LIDS password for hacking further.
 
After this, each program should be given restrictions and exceptions, telling which programs should do what, and nothing else. The default is none is allowed to access nothing else.  For example we can say that only LOGIN can do SU, and SSHD can use BIND, which in turn can use port 22 only, and so on? The permissions specified may also specify up to which level (number of child process) that inherit the privileges. All these options are done using lidsconf command. The command is well documented, and more help may be provided by Prabhu, provided he is free.
 
What if, you need to use the system without the restrictions of LIDS? For this we have the LFS ? LIDS Free Zone. This is entered by using lidsadmin (with some options), and entering the LIDS password. The beauty is that, the programs that you run in the LFS have all root access. But the child processes wont have any such privileges.  
 
We can hide particular directories/ users/services etc? using LIDS. The LIDS directory itself becomes invisible.
 
For this reason, some modifications should be made to all startup scripts to stop using the /etc directory to write logs, and change link /etc/mtab to /proc filesystem, and so on? Else u r doomed :P. More info on this may be accessed from LIDS.ORG, and also from Prabhu (if he is free).
 
PRABHU WANTS TO STEP DOWN:
Finally Prabhu declared that he wants to step down as the coordinator of LUGC. (How sad?) He is too tired of being the coordinator and keeping things going and arranging things for the past four years. He finds it difficult as other priorities such as completion of his PhD have greater priority. He welcomes people, young blood, to take up the position. Of course he will be in the mailing list and will be attending the meetings, but not so regularly. He will surely help us in getting some room for the meeting in IIT. Any takers??? 
 
CHIT CHAT:
There were these new comers to the meeting, who had come to know about ilugc, only within a week earlier. They were given a brief history of iLUGc, and they were actually here for that scheduled talk that got cancelled.
 
There was this new gentleman (sorry don?t remember the name) who was wondering if iLUGc could be made more active, by focusing on more ?practical? stuff, and more commercial interest being included.. and so on. He said, he is not very clear, and he will give his suggestions in due course. He also wanted to have a system, an accounting system, on the same lines of the railway booking terminals. Dumb terminals, running Linux at the server, and having no fear of viruses. He is open  for all modes of getting it done. commercial / personalized/ GNU software (if any, already).
 
There was also a small discussion on the capabilities of DEB and RPM and the powers of the same. The discussion was mooted by Debian fans Prahu, Karra and others.
 
Mr. Bharath wanted to know if there are any lightweight office applications/word processor that would run on FVWM/TWM, without KDE/GNOME. He wants to add the same to his ?rural computer?. Any suggestions?
 
This is all that I remember. If any modifications/omissions/inconsistencies/changes/? are there, please intimate the same.

Many a times we tend to envy Kerela for what they have been doing. Nice
projects like the IT-Schools project (refer to the list archives of
fsf-edu, fsf-friends at http://mm.gnu.org.in/) have been going on well.
We can observe two things at ILUGC:

  1. Lots of enthusiatic volunteers. This is very good for us. If we
  plan and focus all this energy we can do wonders.
  2. Wide spectrum of skills amongst the members. This is good for
  obvious reasons because we would sure be able to execute almost any
  project.

  Nice and happy news: Sharan, root@chennailug.org, admin@focus infotech
  (the company that hosts our website), has been kind enough to let us
  have our own mysql database. Now we can have nice things done. I'm
  planning to put up something like Drupal (http://www.drupal.org/) and
  replace the existing CSV-databased-chennailug.org. I guess this would
  help us carry out such projects. Moreover this would also reduce the
  burden on the webmaster. I'm pretty sure there will be a lot of people
  willing to moderate/contribute to the website. :)

Prabhu has been a very open person and has very much made ILUGC what it
is today. I'm really proud and have admired him for having framed a nice
set of policies for our LUG. Thanks prabhu. :)

am sorry for not having updated the website about the cancelled talks. I
was caught with personal work. :(

Precisely. But then I personally stand against commercialisation of
ILUGC's activities. There have been numerous examples of other LUGs
(BLUG is a very good example :>) around india that got defaced because
they got commercial. and they start encouraging non-free software.

Great work natraj! Keep it going! :)

  more people favour a change in name from ILUGC to IGLUGC (actually
  IGLUGC wins ILUGC by 2 votes ;) ). 

  I would be glad to design a title image for IGLUGC :) but along with,
  I feel we should also:
  
    * stop encouraging use/display/demo of non-free softwares
      at our group's meets/events.
    * Discourage queries on proprietary software on our mailing list.

  What do you guys say?

[assuming bash is your shell]

Edit ~/.bashrc and add the line:

export http_proxy=http://your.proxy.com/

This will make lynx/links/w3m/etc,. use the proxy. I guess wget too will
work however wget has its own proxy directive in /etc/wgetrc.

But is this going to be released as a free software? :-) Thats my
question. I wanted to stuff useful software/documents/etc., from this
into the Debian-Edu project (http://wiki.debian.net/DebianEdu)

Thanks and hope this can be used for the Debian-Edu project.

   Did any one configured Dishnet DSL USB modem for linux.
   They supplied Aztech 100 DSU modem.Normally they terminate
   at NIC then it won't be problem. Google search says no
   driver yet for linux.

Linux is one of the kernels of  the GNU system.  If you use Linux as the
kernel, then it is appropriate that you call the whole OS as GNU/Linux.


>> They supplied Aztech 100 DSU modem


They do not  and I remember having contacted the  Aztec guys asking this
same question.

I wanted to  subscribe to this Dishnet ADSL connection but  I did not do
the switch  because they have  no drivers for  the GNU OS.   The service
offered  by Dishnet  is  faster  that the  Cable  connection offered  by
Asianet in  Kochi.  I opted  for the Cable  service because I  could use
this service under GNU/Linux.

Best.....

Hello Baranidharan,

You can configure lynx to use proxy in lynx.cfg. Usually it will be in
/etc/lynx.cfg
for wget you can edit /etc/wgetrc to use proxy

hope this will help you.

Hi,

I am using redhat 7.3 with 2.4.18-3 kernel. Here i am trying to scan
things with my hp scanjet3200c scanner(parallel port) and is connected to
my pc. I am able to scan from win98 and unable to scan from linux, i
suppose the driver for hp scanjet3200c is missing in mine.  I have my
sane(scanner access now easy) libraries and frontends (xsane, scanimage,
xscanimage) installed proper and parport kernel module too is loaded and
no printer is connected to my machine and lpd is stopped. If i invoke
scanimage app, it reports 'no SANE device is found'. Even if i invoke
anyother frontends, it reports similar error.

Is there linux driver for hp scanjet3200c or compatible is available? If
so, can you please point it out here. Have anyone tried using hp
scanjet3200c in linux successfully? If yes, your valuable comments about
installing/configuring appropriate driver are very welcome.

TIA.

Thanks for the compliments!  It has been fun all these years.  I
learnt so much and got to meet so many interesting people.  Plus I got
to do my two bits for the community.

BTW, I still will be around for quite a while.  Its just that I will

Thanks but really ILUGC is where it is because of many people.  I just
happened to be there at the right place at the right time.  We should
all remember Arun Krishnaswamy.  It was he who first got me to meet
him and thats when it all started.  Heartfelt thanks to Prof. Sriram
who provided so much support (and who also got me started with my
first Linux install!).  Besides, we should not forget Arun Sharma,
Thaths and the other Linux-India founders for starting the whole ILUG
concept.  It was on the Linux-India mailing list
<linux-india@grandteton.cs.uiuc.edu> where K. Arun and I became
acquainted.

Asokan and Roshan also have provided invaluable support.  It is truly
remarkable that ILUGC has been succesful in being a non-commercial and
informal group!

There are so many others to thank for ILUGC's success (in no
particular order), Cheeni for LDD2 etc., Suraj for wonderful minutes
and the webmastering, Lateral for hosting and support during the PCQ
show, Asokan and co. for the site and support at various times
(LDD1/LDD2 etc.), IITM for being such great hosts, Prof. Sriram for
guidance, help, support, etc., Ravi for so much entertainment, ;).
Thanks also go to the many speakers, contributors and members on the
mailing list.  I'm sorry if I've left out anyone.  There are just so
many people to thank who have made ILUGC a success.  Thanks to you
all.

BTW this looks like some kind of farewall speech.  As I said in an
earlier mail I'm not leaving ILUGC yet, I'm just going to become a
non-official ILUGC member. :)

cheers,

No.  I thought we had decided long ago that ILUGC is far more
appropriate for our group than IGLUGC.  If we call it IGLUGC it would
be sacrilege to speak/write about anything non-GNU on the list or
meetings!?

Stop the use/display of non-free software in the GNU sense of things
might mean no talk of anything under anything apart from the (L)GPL
license?  If that is the case it is unacceptable.  

Is it wrong to tell people how to use/install cygwin?

I see no point in changing the name.

	I do not know if my "vote" counts, since I'm not physically in
Madras, nor am I likely to be, in the foreseeable future. If you ask me, I
would be happier with ILUGC remaining ILUGC, and continuing with life as
it used to be, when I was active. Like continue to demo/discuss Linux,
BSDs, Cygwin, etc. and not really restrict ourself to *just* GNU/Linux, or
other GPL'ed software.

Mr. Noronha,

I am happy to know that we share the same concerns. For your
convenience, I have pasted below stripped text versions of the RULE
home page and FAQ. Again, any feedback is welcome, and you are
encouraged to point out the project to how many people as possible.

We NEED more developers and end-users feedback, particularly when it
comes to localization, packagin, and post install customization.
We also need more non technical feedback (talking about school needs,
etc.. from people already involved in that activities).

The right ways to ask are to me personally for general information, or
directly on the project mailing list (subscribe FIRST!, please) for
specific technical issues.

I look forward to work togeteher on these problems.

         Ciao,
                          Marco Fioretti

THE RULE PROJECT: Run Up2date Linux Everywhere

------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Purpose of the project

    * Modify the current Red Hat Linux installer so that it runs in less
      than 32 MB of RAM, or create a new one if needed.
    * Select, test, and (if needed) package the system and desktop
      applications which give the greatest real functionality with the
      smallest consumption of CPU and RAM resources
    * Create another installation option of the Red Hat Linux
      distribution (not another distribution, see the FAQ), containing
      all and only the packages above, optimized to run either a server,
      or a basic desktop on obsolete hardware with very little RAM and
      HD space.
    * Promote and support (especially in developing countries) the use
      of this install option with schools, public and private
organizations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Target users

This install option is meant to benefit primarily two classes of users:

    * GNU/Linux newbies who cannot afford modern computers, but still
      need, to get started more easily, an up to date, well documented
      distribution.
    * System administrators and power users who have no interest in eye
      candy, and want to run updated software on whatever hardware is
      available, to minimize costs, or just because it feels like the
right thing to do.

The PROJECT development page of RULE is:

Anpulla Singapore Anbu,

Mikka nandri for such rapid translation work on this monumental success by
Singapore-based Prabu on the 100% Tamil Computer OS. With your deed, you add
to our collective online collaboration successes and help extinguish the
unprofessional voices of despair, excuses and hopelessness that many like to
echo ad nauseaum.

Can I suggest a little incremental effort-great gain initiative?

I reminded Harish Pillay, the President of Singapore Linux User Groups to
prominently feature this at the Linux conference next month in Singapore -
see http://www.lugs.org.sg . And to rope in the Singapore Tamil press for
this newsworthy release. And aim the publicity to get lots more Tamil youth
in Singapore to provide mind resources for continued Tamil Linux/Tamildom
Everyware work. Harish had already asked the organising committee to do so.

Now chances are the Organising Committee is pressed for time, and is nowhere
as action-passionate (understandably so), priority-wise about Tamil Linux as
Prabu, you and me are. Thus:-

(a) phone Prabu and Harish and the three of you meet up

(b) let Tamil Murasu Kunalan know 100% Tamil Linux OS (mention that I asked
you to contact him)

(c) work out with Harish or his nominee, how best it can be featured at the
Linux Conference - perhaps he can point some Tamil computing students nodal
relationships at NUS/Nantech to assist you

(d) online assist Chennai Maharajan as he comes to grips with how
significant this is and how big of a step it is in our direction towards
"Tamildom Everyware".

(e) load up your document onto the Files Section of Erumbugal and make every
Tamil group on and off the Net aware of it. While mentioning that it will be
one of the highlights at the Singapore Linux conference (offer this added
publicity for the conference as a carrot to get the organisers to agree),
send out emails and get someone in the locality to phone follow-up with
press folks. In particular Tamil press bridges like Chennai Dr Bose,
Dinakaran Vanangamudi, Manorama Press etc Sivalingam, Hindu Biz IT Murali,
Vikatan Vaasan, Colombo Jeyatheepan, Toronto Giritharan (I have more
relationships -- mention my name and you will have greater response cos I
have earned my track record). Perhaps you can find someone in Erumbugal or
prospect one to be our PR point man/woman in Chennai.

Do above, keep Erumbugal posted and I will suggest more connections,
processes and steps. And while doing this, you will be building valuable
relationships for your and Tamil's future as well as learning by doing the
power and foibles of strategic online <--> offline collaboration.

calling ILUGC as IGLUGC doesn't mean we wont talk about free softwares.
We might as well embrace other free softwares that aren't GPLed. But
what I thought we ought to do was to give GNU the credit. Now that ILUGC
is quite familiar I thought we shouldn't mislead people into the
thinking that "Linux" is the entire operating system. That was my only
idea behind a name change. Even if we call ourselves as a "Linux User
Group" I think we aren't entirely doing pure "Linux" stuff. We support,
organise talks on other free softwares too. But "Linux" isn't the right
term, is it?

prabhu> Is it wrong to tell people how to use/install cygwin?

I wasn't refering to the cygwin demos/talks at all. 

Not at all. What I meant by "Display" of non-free software was stuff
like what we did on our demo day. we had machines that ran Q3 et other
non-free softwares. This gave our LUG's seal of approval to the use of
non-free softwares. This is where I thought our LUG should change
itself. I felt we should educate people, the importance of free
softwares from the point of view of freedom / moral values that mere
technical supremacy.

Proprietary software is evil in that  it is leading users' to a deadly
and one-way  trap (lock-in) and that  users' once they  fall into this
bottom-less  pit cannot  extricate  themselves.  Proprietary  software
keeps you chained  to their products and the  lock-in achievement is a
perfect bonus for  these guys.  You become dependent  on them for each
and every  fix/feature and  you will be  forced even to  mortgage your
house just to read and make  copies of the `land record' on which your
house is built.

Users' like you  are not knowing the consequences  fully and I request
that  you come  over to  Kerala  and see  for yourself  the harm  that
proprietary  software is causing....very  soon college  students would
land up  behind bars  for unauthorized copying  of software,  they are
just doing a normal thing for helping themselves and you are endorsing
the viewpoint that  copying of a software is like  boarding a ship and
killing people.

I volunteer to bear your entire trip expense to Kerala and back.

Hello Baranidharan

Open the file /etc/lynx.cfg and search for
#http_proxy:http://some.server.dom:port/

You have to edit this parameter according to your need.

For example if your proxy server running in 192.168.1.100 and port 3128
then edit this parameter as

http_proxy:http://192.168.1.100:3128/

export ftp_proxy=ftp://192.92.25.13:8888/
export http_proxy=http://192.92.25.13:8888/

Plz check whether you exported correctly.

You can try "links" (another console level browser) :)

Ragoo's response was just what I wanted to respond, though I never knew
about that kerala thingy. It is one's personal wish whether they want to
use non-free softwares or not, but we, as a public's well-wisher group,
shouldn't lead them to such a pit.

I've setup a vote on the same topic. People can cast their votes on
http://chennailug.org/ to express their views. This poll has nothing to
do with the name change. This is just to measure how many people want to
feature non-free/proprietary softwares on chennailug.org. The "Name
change" poll would be brought back after the end of this vote ;-)

Depends if you want to make the addition available in the future releases or 
just want to have them on your site.

go to the games dir (most distros install fortune under there) and add it to 
the fortune.db or something similar.. `find` for it if you don't know the 
exact location.

If you want to make it available in the future releases, contact the 
authors.. ;)

set the env variables ``protocol''_proxy to the proxy host and port.

Message-ID: <JIEJJMCEIMFADEIEBHOCMEINCJAA.smohan@vsnl.com>

I've seen threads where many members want CDs. IITM has mirrors for a few
distros. Can burning of CDs (blanks given by the member) be made a charged
service - nominal say Rs.50/- so that ilugc can create a corpus? Many LUGs
have LUG stuff for sale like T-shirts (saw a thread there too) etc and this
could be one such.

I'm for one ready to pay for this service if we could say that every
Saturday morning from 10-1 this service will be available for any member who
walks in or during the ilugc meeting.

Thats how it was, during the good old days of Dr.P.Sriram attending the
LUG meets. Generally we would all be eagerly waiting to hear Dr.P.Sriram
talk and at the right moment some random luser (no offenses meant) would
ask DPS to burn a copy of "Linux 6.1"(sic) and he would burn it for
*free* (yes, free as in free beer!)

But that was when we used to meet at IITM's Computer center. I donot
know if aero has a CD-Burner. Even if it does, I donot know who would be
able to take responsibility / authorisation to access it. 

<my 0.02>
Someone can bring a computer (preferably a laptop) with a CD-Writer to
every meet. This would help us in two ways:

  * we can write CDs during meets.
  * We can use the laptop/box for demoing.

But this also involves other complications such as getting permits to
bring in the box inside the campus, willingness of the owner of the box
to let ppl format/install stuff, etc.,

sir,
  I have installed mandrake 8.2 linux 2.4 kernel in the primary 
partition and grub loader in the mbr.

first i installed linux in /dev/hda1 - primary partition as linux 
native and /dev/hda5 as linux swap.

Later i installed win 2k advanced server as ntfs and now my whole 
partition get collapsed and now hda1 was my win2k adv. server and 
hda5 was my linux swap and my linux native was /dev/hda6.

and couldn't find any data in /dev/hda6 i tried mount -t ext2 
/dev/hda6 /tmp
and find no data in hda6 but there should be data because just the 
partition gets altered and there's no chance for loss of data and 
i tried linux rescue and other rescue options and i tried upgrade 
install and it states that there was no linux partition and i was 
in deep trouble .
Help me to recover this

hi all,

right now, we mirror only the iso images (for redhat) and the binary trees 
for debian and redhat. we also mirror LDP, so most documentation is there 
(but not like the redhat installable cd). sources (especially for debian) 
will be large and also involve lot more traffic; if there is sufficient 
demand from users, i will consider mirroring some sources also.

Hi  Ponguru

Please refer the below  refered mail sent to the iLUGC mailing list,
regarding your requirements.

This is interesting  -- part-time,  from home  work.
Probably  my  wife would be interested. She's  been  a  Solaris Admin
with IBM's AT&T project,  but  recently  resigned to have a  kid.

What would  be the modalities of work?

Because proprietary software world calls sharing software with your
neighbours itself as illegal and gives it a name  - "Piracy". The
dictionary meaning of the word piracy is: "robbery on the high seas;
taking a ship away from the control of those who are legally entitled to
it". Is this what you do by sharing software with your friends? I
disagree. 

When you buy a software/music/video it belongs to *you*. and its *you*
who decides what to do with it. If I buy an audio CD its upto me to give
it to my friends to enjoy it or keep it all to myself, what does the
owner of the music/software have to do here? lets say, when I buy a car,
its *mine* and its *me* who decides what to do with it. The car
manufacturer never tells me that I shouldn't sell it to others. I feel
the same rule should be applied to software too. and if I sell this
piece of software that *I* bought is it equivalent to attacking a ship?
I disagree.

mirror ISOs. I made my ISOs from iitm's mirror.  Thanks to DPS & IITM.

Hi Barani,

Do not use telnet. Use SSH, and ssh clients are
available all over the net like teraterm(<1MB),
http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/ttermp23.zip

If you still want telnet, make sure you installed
telnet server. If not install using
this command...

#urpmi telnet-server

This will install all necessary dependentant
packages...and no need to touch xinetd, if i'm not
wrong.

Cheers.,
Prabu

Hi Suraj,

  Just a small correction in the thumbnails that I sent. We can 
drop one of those four images. The one which says"I WANT GNU". 
Because it is not available at a bigger size suitable for 
printing. If somebody can recreate that image at a higher 
resolution, we can think about putting that as one of the 
options.

If the thumnail images that I sent are ok we can proceed with the 
voting system setup once I let you know about the price.
Give me 2 days time. I am contacting someone in Thiruppur who is 
one among the top authorities there. Moreover, we can be rest 
assured of the quality of printing and T-shirts used which are of 
export quality. Most important thing is it will work out to be 
cheaper.

Please let me know the color of the T-shirt we would be 
purchasing. I think white would be ok.

Cheers!!!

I would suggest you not to enable telnetd due to security reasons, rather use sshd, and use scp than using ftp.

Incase you are curious how to enable telnetd, go to the mandrake control center, enable telnetd or use
#start telnetd

sure. I will scale them to a higher resolution and make sure
that it eats lesser colours. We can sort of dither it or deface it and
make sure it comes out well on screen-prints.

personally, I'm expecting more "cheaper" types tees than
export-quality-types. :) anyway... 

somu> Please let me know the color of the T-shirt we would be

no. white isn't preferred. Please try something else. like navy or
maroon or yellow or gray. white is boring. ;)

I agree with what suraj meant by saying this.

You pay for something and you have the right to do "whatever" you want to do, though not to make copies and distribute/resell. which inturn violates the so called "copyright".

from which i can take the iso image? or you will take my iso image and
burn a cd for me? in the latter case, no thanks. i have a cd writer. in
the former case, yes, your offer is welcome; tell me when you have the iso
image ready and i will provide the blank cd's. in any case, ftp.iitm.ac.in
is down right now. there is some problem with the disks and the disk
upgrade also is in progress. it may take a day or so and then it should
all be up.

Hi Suraj,

    Even though I share your views, I can't help but point out one flaw
in your line of reasoning with a car.  If you buy a car you can do
anything with it, even sell it.  However in case of a video or cd you can
also make multiple copies of it and sell them while still retaining the
original - this is called piracy.  You are profiting out of someone else's
efforts. Can you do this with a car ? No.  If give your car to your neighbor
for his use you are not able to use it at that same time. Similarly if you
give away your commercial sw cd to your neighbor and do not use it anymore,
this is also ok.

This is primary difference between other tangible assets and software.
With something like a car or a book one person has paid for it an only
one person can use it at a time, whether he is original owner or not.
BTW making photocopies of an entire book is also illegal.

Having said that I'd reiterate that I am all for open/free software and
technology. I hate proprietary software/technology that lock you into a
trap - it is unfortunate that I am having to run a weird, quriky, 
idiosyncratic,
bloated, big bad brotherly, freedom - crushing, complex, reboot requiring,
inefficient proprietary OS on my desktop because my work demands it :(

Regards,
Moinak.

The whole idea of a "copyright" itself is a way of pulling people into
this pit. and most of such copyrights / licenses from proprietary
companies are designed to prevent users from sharing software. Thanks to
the GPL, we have a wonderful "copyleft" system that enables you to share
software. Instead of the greedy licenses that proprietary software
companies put forth, GPL exclusively authorises each and every
individual who received a GPLed software, the right to modify and
redistribute the software.

GPL in all its glory:

The manufacture of each car takes up necessary amount of labour, skill
and material and charges only for all that he invests "per car" (of
course with a little profit margin). However with softwares[/music], the
amount of efforts put forth for developing a piece of software is
irrespective of the number of users OR the number of copies that are
going to be made for one software (barring the copying/distribution
costs). But software vendors greedily charge for _every_ "copy" of their
software.  That is where, IMHO, software should be free from such
licenses which prevent you from sharing. 

Even more vulnerable are users when they start signing EULAs which
restrict the use of softwares for specific purposes. Its like saying:
"You can drive this car only on Anna salai", though you pay the same
money to buy the car, you are restricted from using it for whatever
purpose that you wanted to use it for. Evil isn't it?

At this situation the user who has the money to buy each copy buys it.
Those who dont, start thinking of "doing without it". When the number of
users for a software is less, there is lesser number of feedback that
the developer is going to get from the user and hence lesser bugs fixed.
This worsen the situation for those who bought the software and they end
up living with unfixed bugs and vulnerabilities although they paid for
it.

The free software business model aims at solving such issues by creating
an open market for softwares:

Hello,

	This is getting more and more interesting and has good potential for a flame 
war :)

I have been using proprietary software for a while now, and am quite aware of 
some of the issues you raise. However, you seem to have taken the extreme 
view; not all proprietary s/w companies are as bad as you make them out to 
be. Also, Free/free software are not yet in any position to replace some of 
the existing good Proprietary software. Examples, you say. We use a film 
compositing software called "Inferno" from Discreet Logic. There isn't 
/anything/ that even comes close to this in free/Free world. The Gimp is good 
enough in most cases, but there are times Photoshop is the king of the 
hill... We have good support contracts with the vendors, and all issues are 
dealt with within the terms of those.

> Users' like you  are not knowing the consequences  fully 

Care to explain who "Users' like you" are? And why you deem us blissfully 
ignorant of the "consequnces" ?

> and I request

Well, two things : a) If the Govt of Kerala screwed up, tough. They should 
have read the fine print. Or should have bothered to ask the community on 
whose behalf they were acting. Or maybe they majority of them voted 
proprietary (tyranny of the majority sucks now doesn't it), just like the 
most vocal group here wil vote "Free only". Nobody twisted their arm to buy 
proprietay s/w. b) I would be happy to learn from the experience to avoide 
commiting the same mistakes elsewhere.

Nope they aren't. If you do not like the terms under which the software is 
sold you are free to walk away, no questions asked. I do not say they must be 
jailed for so trivial an offence, but this is a matter to be taken up with 
the people in charge of the situation.

> and you are endorsing

I will take Suraj's comment on this, and just say that both of you have 
managed to tar the entire community of Proprietary software developers with 
the same brush.

> I volunteer to bear your entire trip expense to Kerala and back.

No thanks, but I would definitely like to hear about the details on what is 
going on, this might be a very learning experience for al of us. If there is 
something we can do to help, I am sure we will.

out on different forums about the fultity of this analogy. No more please.

How do /you/ get to decide what is greedy and what is not ? It is their 
software, if you do not lije the terms of distribution, feel free not to use 
it. You raise an interesting point on licenses that prevent sharing. What say 
you about the GPL?

> This worsen the situation for those who bought the software and they end

[non-pre-judicial question] Do you develop any software ? Have you done any 
software testing ?

The fundamental flaw with the approach we have both taken is the failure to 
see that there are two basic varities in s/w markets : horizontal (office 
products fall in to this category), and vertical (exclusive development on 
specific platforms). You tend to assume that all s/w models are horizontal, I 
spend most of my time in the second market... 

Like I said before, users can vote with their waallet and choose not to run 
proprietary s/w. We do use Office (97), and Windows 2000 because they do the 
job we need them to do (No, we will never run XP, but that is another 
discussion). When we have Free/free tools to replace these we will. But 
meanwhile, in the real world, things need to get done.

best regards
BGa

Ppl tend to think of GPL as a restrictive license that does not let you
do *everything* that you wanted to do with it(like use it in
proprietary/non-free softwares). There are priorities with various
freedoms. Some freedoms need to give way to the others. I love quoting
how RMS explained this: "My freedom to swing my arm ends at the point
where your nose begins". 

What most of the people fail to see is the freedom that comes along with
your GPL protected software. Unlike other vulnerable licenses, like the
BSD license for instance, the GPL makes sure that the free software that
you write wont be abused by non-free software companies and that it
would have the same freedoms irrespective of how it develops / is used. 

We can also find a lot of people who write free software releasing their
code under non-GPLed free licenses such as the BSD license giving
various reasons:

  * Under GPL my software wont develop as fast as it would if I release
    it under the BSD license
  * There might be "good" proprietary software companies who might
    increase the fame of my software by incorporating it in their
    software. If I release it under the GPL they wont be able to do so.
    I want my software to be "famous".

various reasons. although writing free softwares is a deed worth
appreciating, the GPL is a protection to make sure the software isn't
abused. By all this I'm not trying to discourage the use of other free
software licenses. My humble opinion is that the GPL is a good way of
making sure that one's work remains free for sure. For some its "okay"
if the companies that compare sharing of software to that of attacking a
ship develops on the software that they write. It is infact a matter of
personal ethics whether one wants to use a free software or a
proprietary software. Primarily this thread started off to know how many
people wanted to go by this ethics of sharing software and enjoying
freedom.  *shrug*

I agree that there aren't enough free softwares for all needs. But We
aren't talking about the availability of enough free softwares for
various needs. We are primarily talking about why ILUGC should[n't]
support non-free softwares.

Yes, there can be a never ending list of proprietary softwares that
might out do free softwares. But the basic difference is the freedom
that free softwares offer while non-free softwares donot. It is upto
oneself whether they want to be in a prison and tied to proprietary
software OR to lead a happy computing life (maybe with/without an
appreciable loss/gain in features/functionality). Again, it depends on
one's ethical view point and what they want to do, if all that one
wanted was to type out a document, yes, there are free alternatives.
OTOH if one wanted "exactly" all that <name your favourite non-free
software> has to offer then there isn't much help to offer. As was said
earlier there are certain sacrifices that one may have to make to be
free. 

Primarily the reason for starting off this thread is that we, in ILUGC,
have been admirers of free softwares and I thought ILUGC wanted to share
good moral values with its members? am I asking for something that I can't
get here?

Hi,
I run RedHat 7.3 on a dual boot machine also running Windows XP.
Sound is perfect on windows. On the Linux side I have configured the sound 
card using 'sndconfig'.
The card is a Creative Vibra 128, and was identified by Linux as 
"Ensoniq/Creative" sound card.
The sample sound file was played. When I send some other .wav file to 
/dev/audio using 'cat' command it plays too.

But when I insert a audio CD the Gnome CD player shows up and the time 
counter starts, but without any sound.
Same is the case with XMMS. The open command in both the applications show 
tracks with duration of tracks in the /mnt/cdrom folder. In XMMS the 
plug-in for audio CDs is enabled.
Suggestions?

Another question, Is there any way of playing .wma (Windows media player 
ripped) sound files in Linux?
Your sound minds can help my sound card. Thanks.

JP

Hi,

For your last question, use mplayer with win32 codes
package to play Windows media files. .. all formats
supported.

I use mandrake with Ensoniq sound card, so i never
configured  anything . Install mandrake and it works
using 

since sound comes out when you cat, try to see if
sound servers like esound or arts blocks... Try a
native player ...if in kde try 
noatun ...

BTW i write this listening to songs... 

Cheers.,
Prabu

Bga,

 OK agreed the anology between the car and the software has gone a bit 
too far but it does have a lot fo things in common 
Ok although I dont want to say that I should  have the right to produce
another new car with the car I bought , I defenitly would like to want to
add an additional stereo or  but a fuel booster if I know how to out it in
in the first place , 
 Now you told about vertical software would it not have been great if you
can program that extra short cut key that you really need rather than having
to upgrade to a 100 new features along with this one extra feature you want,


Bga>>Having said that I'd reiterate that I am all for open/free

Hello,

How do /you/ get to decide what is greedy and what is not ? It is their 
software, if you do not lije the terms of distribution, feel free not to
use 
it. You raise an interesting point on licenses that prevent sharing.
What say 
you about the GPL?

[non-pre-judicial question] Do you develop any software ? Have you done
any 
software testing ?

The fundamental flaw with the approach we have both taken is the failure
to 
see that there are two basic varities in s/w markets : horizontal
(office 
products fall in to this category), and vertical (exclusive development
on 
specific platforms). You tend to assume that all s/w models are
horizontal, I 
spend most of my time in the second market... 

Like I said before, users can vote with their waallet and choose not to
run 
proprietary s/w. We do use Office (97), and Windows 2000 because they do
the 
job we need them to do (No, we will never run XP, but that is another 
discussion). When we have Free/free tools to replace these we will. But 
meanwhile, in the real world, things need to get done.

best regards
BGa

Enter the GRUB command mode and find for any file, say /boot/vmlinuz
find /boot/vmlinuz
This will show the partition containg /bbot/vmlinuz
(if such a file exists)
After that booting should be no problem. Use the kernel
and boot commands.

hi,

I find this thread with many inconsistencies.  I have nothing against
the GPL.  There are many uses for a license such as the GPL.  Its just
this bigoted attitude that everything should be GPL'd that is
irritating and pretty ridiculous.

I predict that someone will accuse me of using proprietary code and
being evil etc.  To set the record straight, I dont run pirated
software.  I posses a legal copy of an old version (IIRC 1998) of
Applixware and thats about it (I have seldom used it and its not even
installed right now).  I've used less commercial software than most
folks on this list.  I run one OS -- Debian GNU/Linux.  I might be
evil in your eyes (but it could be your eyes that are fooling you ;).

If you want to use the dictionary selectively to prove your point its
very easy to break down GPL.

 freedom:
     1. The state of being free; exemption from the power and
        control of another; liberty; independence.

And dont tell me GPL is free of restriction!  I've read the license.
You cant include GPL code with BSD code even though BSD is free.
Please, I understand why the GPL is designed that way.  I'm not that
stupid.  Its just that I wanted to show you that you can use a
dictionary meaning selectively to prove anything.

Yes, I know you'll say free beer and free speech and free this and
free that.  So what?  You still forget the dictionary meaning.  Using
the dictionary meaning means nothing.  Anyone will tell you that a
words meaning depends on the context.

Anyway, if the agreement is that you are not allowed to do something
when you buy something.  You can't.  If you dont like it dont buy it.
That does not give you the right to break that agreement.  It doesn't
make it right or wrong.  Its just the way it is.

    SK> When you buy a software/music/video it belongs to *you*. and
    SK> its *you* who decides what to do with it. If I buy an audio CD
    SK> its upto me to give it to my friends to enjoy it or keep it
    SK> all to myself, what does the owner of the music/software have

Ofcourse he does.  When you buy something you are saying that you
agree to the terms and conditions of usage (heck, thats what you pay
for!).  If you cant or dont read the agreement it is not an excuse.
If you dont like it dont buy it.  Just because you paid a few bucks
does not mean you own the universe.

I also find this attitude totally inconsistent.  You say you will not
accept a license that restricts you from distributing the code or
whatever.  Yet, when someone buys a copy of Emacs from RMS (I mean he
pays for the CD's plus whatever RMS asks for) and then decides to do
what he wants with the code (as in extends it, sells it and does not
release the code as GPL) that he *paid* for you say its wrong?  What
kind of one sided freedom is this?  If a commercial company gives you
a license you say its wrong and we should have the right to
steal^H^H^H^H^H, umm, distribute the code but if RMS distributes his
"free" software the commercial company cant use it in its product?
What freedom is this?

So, point is, its not about freedom.  Its about keeping the sources
eternally open (by closing doors on certain "evil" people -- what
irony?).  Whether that is a good idea or not is a different issue.
But its definitely not "freedom" as we all know it.

Besides, its OK if Al-Qaeda or Hitler (lets hope that accelerates the
death of this thread. die thread! die thread! ;) uses GPL software and
makes the sources GPL'd -- even if those sources killed half of
humanity!  However if some poor bloke who has to make a living writing
code (just to feed, clothe and shelter himself) wants to use it, its
evil?  So all this talk of ethics and morality is garbage.

This talk of ethics and morality is usually post facto rationalization
and you try to market this ideology "that everything should be GPL'd"
with it.  Nice try.

Thinking that everything must be GPL'd is absurd.  No one system or
license will fit the bill (no pun intended) all the time.  There is a
place for different licenses.  Nothing wrong with that.  Its absurd
expecting a one size fits all solution.

So please don't be fanatical about anything.

Yes, thats true of all licenses.  You cant do everything with it.  And
much as I would have liked it to be, you cant do everything with
(x)emacs either. ;)

I pray, how it is that you have such great powers to know what other

can't read English?  Well you do have a point.  Most folks cant read

What abuse?  They use it and you allow it or disallow it (depending on
the license you use).  When you choose to be abused its no longer
abuse.  So whats the big deal?  Its just a manifestation of freedom.

Its usually not fame.  Its just that there is a good chance that
better software will be available.  

The world is not black and white.  Atleast it isn't for me.

    SK>     I want my software to be "famous".

Ofcourse I do.  I write software so that its used well.  Not so that
its languishing in some idealistic tower of some apparently pure
license.  I do what I think is best for the community.  In my case
MayaVi would not have been possible but for Python and VTK, which are

Because we are ILUGC and not FSF.

Finally, please consider reading this article.

Vikram mailed me this URL and I read most of it.  Its a very nice
article and makes some very interesting points.


On the lighter side, try this:

fortune -m freedom

There are some very funny ones.  Here are a few:

  It is by the fortune of God that, in this country, we have three
  benefits: freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and the wisdom
  never to use either.
                -- Mark Twain

At no time is freedom of speech more precious than when a man hits his
thumb with a hammer.
                -- Marshall Lumsden

You can have peace.  Or you can have freedom. Don't ever count on having
both at once.
                -- Lazarus Long

Eats first, morals after.
                -- Bertolt Brecht, "The Threepenny Opera"

If people have to choose between freedom and sandwiches, they
will take sandwiches.
                -- Lord Boyd-orr

If society fits you comfortably enough, you call it freedom.
                -- Robert Frost

cheers,
prabhu

p.s. Read my post lightly.  I didn't take any personal offence to your
comments.  I'm simply shooting off the hip.  No offence intended.

Prison?  What?  If there is no free software equivalent its not a
choice you have.  Let me get the analogy straight.  Free software is
freedom in the free world, commercial software is prison.  Ok, so far
so good.  But if there is no free software there is no free world.
Your world consists of a prison then thats all you have, that *is*
your world.  Besides who said the world is free.  There are rules and
remember make sure your fist doesn't hit my nose is one of them.  The
world is a prison, we just like to think that we are free.

BTW, lets say you design big IC's or microprocessors etc.  You cant
get free software to do the job.  Period.  If you are so "ethical"
dont use PC's.  Its a sacrifice to make remember.  Give up your
computer.

We all draw our lines.  Give people their freedom that they can draw
their own lines.  So long as their lines and yours dont intersect,

Yes, like stop using computers etc.  If you are so keen on freedom,
renounce the world and become a Sanyasi.  Its the ultimate sacrifice
and you will be free.  At any rate you'll be free of my flames.

Hi,

Suraj Kumar <suraj@symonds.net> chittered thus:

Suraj> Because proprietary software world calls sharing software with your

	Sure. If you share my tee-shirt I will call it "foobar", and if you
want to use my tee-shirt, I will say you are indulging in "foobar" because I
said so, and I'm allowed to say so, since its *my* tee-shirt. If you don't
like the concept of "foobar", don't use it. But I'm digressing. The point is
this: Ilugc (to me) is just an informal setting where random madrasi geeks
can get together and discuss *Computing* stuff -- We have discussed many
things, including the implementation of the linux kernel, and IPSEC in BSDs,
and about the networking code in Windows 2000. I want it to remain that way.
It does not mean I'm for proprietary software, and waiting/wanting to use
proprietary software.

Suraj> When you buy a software/music/video it belongs to *you*. and its *you*
Suraj> who decides what to do with it. If I buy an audio CD its upto me to give

	Okay, I just bought a knife yesterday. Am I allowed to go stabbing
everyone around me, since its *mine*? Besides, of what relevance is this to
Ilugc? What I'm saying is, if Ilugc wants to discuss the technology behind
knife-making, its perfect. I don't care if the knife was manufactured with
machines using proprietary software, or GPL'ed software.

	The debate was on whether it was okay to discuss proprietary
software at Ilugc, and not quite on what is good for society. But then
again, I do not think its right for me to participate in this thread any
further simply because I'm not going to be at the LUG meets for the
foreseeable future, and if you would rather want to discuss GPL'ed
software, good luck to you, and go right ahead. 

	Au revoir.

Well written Prabhu. I dont see it as a flame.

The key point is, what is the role of ILUGC?
If we discuss/demo prop. sw, are we endorsing it?
What about those of us who have a personal need (and
professional ) to work with them? though we agree with
the principles of GPL/FSF and/or OpenSource?
Like Prabhu said please explain the choices and their
implications but do not enforce; otherwise GPL/FSF is
as tyrannical as prop. sw.
After all if we draw lines to the limits of our knowledge
I may not know that a 'evil sw' was used to design the
proteins that form part of a medicine I need. Okay; now
I come to know. What do I do?
Whatever I do it is my choice.

Message-ID: <F85yBftCcVGtDmAkYxt0000bc11@hotmail.com>

Hi,
  I think it will go into OT but I am not sure.I need to develop a utility 
by which I can use a Linux File system either ext2 or XFS in DOS. That is 
when a Linux machine gone bad and I dont have Linux Boot Floppy,I need to 
boot the machine in DOS and Able to list/read/write Files in ext2/XFS file 
system.
  What I like to know is. whether you people came across any such type of 
utilities. If so please send me the Pointers.

TIA
Sathya

Message-ID: <20020920063701.26475.qmail@webmail6.rediffmail.com>

Hi Suraj,

   Multiple selection for the designs is a good idea. In that 
case, I myself would like to have 2 Tees with different designs. 
Can I expect the voting system setup sometime next week?

Here are the links,

image1- http://debian.org/logos/(This image is available in XCF 
format)

image2- http://www.gnu.org/graphics/agnuhead.html (This image is 
in PNG format with size 566k).

image3- http://www.gnu.org/graphics/bwcartoon.html (This image is 
available in XCF format)

image4- Regarding this image I had contacted the author and he is 
yet to
         reply.

For the images 1,2 and 3, I have both xcf and tiff(printable 
quality) formats. The problem is these are huge files and I can't 
mail it to you. I have them burnt on the cd.

All these images will be printed at the back of the shirt. Am I 
right?

I had contacted the people in Thiruppur regarding this. They need 
the size of all the images that will be printed on out shirt. This 
will help
them to let me know about the cost for each image.

I am going to let them know about the printing size for the first 
3 images.

Name     Printing Size(Width x Height in inches)

image1   10" x 12"
image2   10" x 12"
image3   10" x 10.5"

Are these printing sizes ok? Let me know about this 
immediately!!!

1.What about the size of Tees? - XL/XXL
2.Do you agree with me about the colour of T-shirt being WHITE OR   
OFF-WHITE?

  As of now, I had said them that we will be printing 100 Tees. 
More the number it is good for us.

Do you have a yahoo chat ID? Any urgent clarifications can be done 
quickly online . My ID is yogsom2000.

Cheers!!!
Somu

Hi,

For Win95/NT, not for dos 
http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/explore2fs.htm

However i suggest you to pop in any linux OS CD's(like
mandrake8.2) and type rescue to go to rescue mode. You
will be dropped in a powerful rescue environment,where
you fix any problem.
 
Cheers.,
Prabu

hi,

No. RMS said this in his visit to chennai at MIT, Chromepet:
http://www.chennailug.org/rms-chennai.txt

Yes, I was quoting it from my memory and hence I interchanged a few
words (intent however remains the same).

prabhu> I pray, how it is that you have such great powers to know what other
prabhu> people see or don't see?  Do you think everyone out there is stupid or
prabhu> can't read English?  Well you do have a point.  Most folks cant read
prabhu> legalese anyway, maybe even the lawyers can't.  Maybe thats the whole
prabhu> secret!

I had no intentions of telling that people can't read english or that
people can't read legalese. I was trying to tell that GPL seems
restrictive because it makes sure the freedom goes with the software and
to do this it makes us give way to other less prioritized freedoms. I
had no intentions of telling that non-GPLed free licenses are wrong.
Most of us (including me) use and hail the use of other free licenses. 

prabhu> What abuse?  They use it and you allow it or disallow it (depending on
prabhu> the license you use).  When you choose to be abused its no longer
prabhu> abuse.  So whats the big deal?  Its just a manifestation of freedom.

I shouldn't have used to word abuse. It was an instinct that made me use
the word. When we look at how BSD itself has been "used" by Apple
inc., it made me use strong words. However had FreeBSD been
licensed under the GPL I'm pretty sure MacOSX wouldn't have had
so many people dangled to it now.

prabhu>     SK> We can also find a lot of people who write free software
prabhu>     SK> releasing their code under non-GPLed free licenses such as the
prabhu>     SK> BSD license giving various reasons:
prabhu> 
prabhu> Aha! there you have struck your proverbial fist on my proverbial nose.
prabhu> 
prabhu>     SK>   * Under GPL my software wont develop as fast as it would if
prabhu>     SK> I release it under the BSD license * There might be "good"
prabhu> 
prabhu> Which is possible, mind you.

Agreed. BSD lets _anyone_ develop / add features to your code. That
might be, ummm... in my view *evil* proprietary software companies too
;) I'm not against people making money or using non-free software to get
their job done (if they have all that money). The main intent of this
thread was to ask if ILUGC should encourage the use of non-free
softwares by giving demos of such software.

prabhu> Its usually not fame.  Its just that there is a good chance that
prabhu> better software will be available.  

Considering RMS's vision of giving freedom to all people, we would
definitely note that when all people are free from the hands of
proprietary software all of them would be working on free softwares and
we would all have good quality free softwares. I would again like to
quote RMS's speech at chennai:

"The important thing is to spread freedom to as many people as possible
and ultimately to everyone. Thats the goal thats worth striving for. We
have to remember that goal. because the most important thing for
reaching a distant goal is to remember the goal. if you forget where
you've headed you're going to end-up somewhere else!  and is idealism
really impractical? Not at all. If you are a distant goal, there are
only two ways to reach it. one of them is to have a lot of money. and
the other is idealism. because idealism will enable you to keep on going
until you get there, otherwise you'd just give it up. so we don't have a
lot of money. so we have to have this idealism instead.  there's nothing
more practical like idealism. The GNU system and the GNU/Linux variants
are our idealism made real. But, very few people are saying this to the
users of GNU/Linux"

When all people write free softwares we will have good quality free
softwares. and it _would_ be possible to have a lot of quality code
coming out of free softwares.

prabhu>     SK>     I want my software to be "famous".
prabhu> 
prabhu> Ofcourse I do.  I write software so that its used well.  Not so that
prabhu> its languishing in some idealistic tower of some apparently pure
prabhu> license.  I do what I think is best for the community.  In my case
prabhu> MayaVi would not have been possible but for Python and VTK, which are
prabhu> both licensed under a BSD style license.

hehe.. I never even realised / thought about mayavi when I was posting
the previous mail. :D (and I never knew prabhu would take it to himself
:D)

prabhu>     SK> software isn't abused. By all this I'm not trying to
prabhu>     SK> discourage the use of other free software licenses. My humble
prabhu> 
prabhu> In case you didn't notice, you just did.

Oh I did? 

prabhu> There are other licenses that let you share and enjoy as much if not
prabhu> more freedom.  Please keep that in mind.

I hate repeating the same thing again and again. other free softwares
licenses are good too and there has been a lot of contribution to the
society from those softwares which were released under non-GPLed
licenses. Anything that is free is good. But its just that it would be
better if it assured the freedom. I was just trying to tell that GPL is
a way to protect the freedom that your free software offers someone.

prabhu> Because we are ILUGC and not FSF.

Do you remember what ILUGC's index page reads?

<quote>
We are a heterogeneous group of computer users from the South
Indian city of Chennai (formerly, Madras), united in our use and support
of Free Software in general and the GNU/Linux operating system in
particular
</quote>

Probably I have been in this group without knowing that we not only
support the use of free softwares but also non-free softwares. (thats as
good as saying we are Chennai ALL software users group?) Does the index
page need a change?

Never did I say, in any of my posts, that we shouldn't feature free
softwares like *BSD or cygwin. It has always been a nice thing about
ILUGC because we have never stuck ourselves to one particular OS or
distro or whatever. 

prabhu> Finally, please consider reading this article.

prabhu> Vikram mailed me this URL and I read most of it.  Its a very nice

Yes it did and I happened to know a lot of things. :)

WOW! I'm going to steal your food next ;)

  -Suraj

PS: Its fun for me too to be flaming but then in the larger interest of
the members here I would stop responding to this thread. Primarily
because I, probably by a mistake, thought ILUGC wants to support free
softwares and that it wouldn't make sense if it supports non-free
softwares too. *shrug* so, do I conclude that ILUGC would support
non-free softwares?

ILUGC has had an open mind on what its members use and support. If it aint 
broke don't fix it. Lets just leave things as they are, please; name 
included. Let this thread die in peace...

hi,

  Mr.Pandarinathan Raman, a member of our group, a resident of
  chromepet has found that a school in chromepet is conducting a science
  exhibition on the 19th of October. Raman and myself have plans of
  conducting a small exhibit of GNU/Linux at this school, and if its a
  success, start exhibiting more in other schools. Luckily the 19th of
  Oct happens to be a Saturday. (-:

  Here is a little information:

  Goal: To show that GNU/Linux is a good, free replacement OS for use in
  schools.

  Audience: Mostly School children. Some teachers and parents too.

  Time: Unknown

  Date: starting on 19th and spanning possibly two or three days (most
  likely to end by sunday).

  We are looking at building a small team of 3 to 5 people to organise
  and conduct this demo. Volunteers are invited! (no money, no food
  will be provided (-; )

Suraj,

I'm afraid i cannot join you. But if the school is a
tamil medium school, can you do a demo of Mandrake9.0,
which comes with nice tamil support and in-built linux
terminal server (ideal for schools). 

I've been following your arguments on GNU and
opensource and i think i mostly agree with you. 

Cheers.,

RMS borrowed it from somewhere else.  No big deal.

Some people don't see Apple using BSD as "bad".  Some think its good.
It all differs.  Infact the fact that Apple used BSD is an endorsement
that companies are willing to bet money on OSS.  Which means that OSS
has hope and is good (yeah we all know that but lesser mortals...).
OTOH its an issue that BSD will not get Aqua for free or other tools
for free.  However please note that AFAIK Apple hired one (or more) of
the chief BSD developers, so now BSD gets a full time developer who
works on BSD.  So its not asif Apple simply stole the code and did not
give back.  I also think they would have made some serious
contributions back to the BSD community (I dont know the details tho).
I think many human beings are decent.  Not everyone is a thief. :)

What do you mean by non-free software?  Non-GPL software?  Or
proprietary software that does not come with source?  Most GPL
fanatics (not that you are one) seem to associate non-GPL software
with non-free software.

BTW, there is one advantage of demo'ing commercial software.  You get
to see how commercial software works and what features they put in.
This way you can enhance your free software equivalents.  You should
not hesitate to learn, even if you happen to learn from your enemy. :)

Possible but many of them might not be alive if that were the case.
Many people cannot live like RMS (and many certainly will not want to
be like him).  If software weren't lucrative many folks wouldn't be
working and using computers.  You might be doing something else.
There are other issues to consider here.

Ok, but remember that it is an idealism.  There is one point that I
find unmentioned in RMS's arguments.  He seems to indicate (he may
think otherwise) that software is different and unconnected with the
rest of the world.  It is not.  Economy drives many (most?) things and
economy is a wierd beast.  Its not enough if you idealize a software
world.  You need to idealize the rest of the world too.  Many things
are connected you cant change one without changing the other.  Todays
business practices, economy, society, etc. all control the way many
things and people behave.  You cannot isolate software and idealize
it.  You need to change more than that.  To some western people the
concept of GPL is alien and IIRC Microsoft or someone compared GPL to
communism (which was (is?) considered really evil in the US).  You
see, its not enough if you push GPL, you need to educate them, make
them think differently make companies work differently.  

Currently it makes sense for some to use GPL and some to use BSD.
Both are relavant and useful. Please do not forget that.

    prabhu> There are other licenses that let you share and enjoy as

Maybe maybe not.  Some people think otherwise.  I think ILUGC's
attitude should be to treat all OSS licenses as good enough for
discussion.  Let each choose his/her own license.

By free we really mean OSS.  Arun wrote those words.  He used to run

I think you are jumping a little ahead of yourself.  We only said we
are not a pure GPL group here.  We admire RMS and other folks for what
they have done.  We dont particularly endorse or support any license.
BTW, you've been on this group for a few years now.  When did you see
a commercial demo as in people selling you something?  Have you never
played quake or any decent non-free game?  Whats wrong if someone says
hey here is a demo of crosover plugin running on linux?  Whats wrong
with a VMWare demo?  They are things that are useful.  We dont endorse
them but if you want to demo it whats wrong?  Besides we are
democratic and always decide civilly amongst ourselves.

    SK> do I conclude that ILUGC would support non-free softwares?

Your choice of words is very misleading.  We dont support any
software.  People are nice enough to answer questions -- sometimes
about commercial products.  However we have actively discouraged
questions on commercial products on ilugc (it doesnt make sense anyway
-- they should mail the company).  We also discourage off topic and
windows (and other non-OSS) specific questions.  However if someone is
installing linux on a windows box he/she does need to ask windows
specific questions?  Why should we not support that?

My point is simple.  As Ganesh said, ILUGC is doing fine.  Let it
be. :)

cheers,
prabhu

dear SIR/MADAM,
                 I am a new to LInux , i am working on red hat 7.2 
and i have two problems, I have a CYRIX machine working on a 
BE-MGX board andi cannot find the proper drivers for it! Where can 
i get the drivers for this board, it has a CYRIX5520 chipset with 
integrated XPRESS GRAPHICS AND XPRESound , i reid installing the 
drivers with the media GX drivers that is there in red hat 7.2 , 
it asks me to probe the video configuraiton it suggests, then a 
garbled screen appears,

my second problem is installing Gnomemeeting on the red hat 7.2, 
It first asked me to install GNOME2 , i downloaded garnome and 
tried installing , but in vain, garnome asked me to install GLib 
2.0 , i downloaded glib, but now glib asked me to install 
PK-config, i installed pkconfig 13.0 , now garnome says that u 
must check the pkconfig installed , my question is which pkconfig 
should i install and do i need anything else to install 
Gnomemeeting,

hope you would reply soon,

Thanking you,
Bharath

Thats where the _entire_ misunderstanding took place. By non-free
software what I mean is software that isn't free. software that doesn't
let you view its source code; modify it; redistribute it;. 

Maybe I should have written what I mean by non-free software. I thought,
everybody would obviously take XL/BSDL as free software licenses. (-:

I didn't start off with an opposition to GPL but then the thread saw
various paths and I had to tell that the GPL is a beautiful way of
protecting one's free code. (which then got forked into a BSDL Vs. GPL
flame war and in the process might have seen a good number of civilian
casualty (-;)

prabhu> By free we really mean OSS.  Arun wrote those words.  He used to run

well, OSS is the open source guys who never talk about the freedom
perspective. Though they also work towards creating softwares which are
free they advocate it from the cost perspective. This is bad in a way.
We have all seen the death of netscape and how proprietary software
companies can sell their code at merely 0 price to crush its opponent.
While it is good that a lot of companies come to open up their sources
this way of approach can be crushed easily by the so-called software
giants. But when one talks about software from the freedom
perspective people have a strong reason for accept the software and more
stronger reasons to stop using proprietary softwares.

That is one of the primary differences between the OSS and the Free
software movement. In this thread, I refered to those software which
donot give the basic software freedoms as non-free software (free as not
in GPL alone... (-:)

prabhu> a commercial demo as in people selling you something?  Have you never
prabhu> played quake or any decent non-free game?  Whats wrong if someone says

I donot know of how many other changed, but ever since I heard RMS'
talks (and the effect of seeing the prophet in seeing in person (-;).

During the "Linux Demo Day" that we conducted I was "proud" of ILUGC and
what we were doing. But what was sad was that we were infact not telling
people of the importance of freedom. Then, I used to think that free
software is anything that is Free of Cost (because that was how all the
media (as in linux*.com websites) told about it). I used to love and use
Opera and such non-free software. Ever since I heard RMS I have only
tried to free myself first from non-free softwares. (Not through
completely yet :(. So bad is how I'm locked)

The OSS  came after  Arun & you  started ILUG-Chennai.  So,  `By free'
Arun really meant the ideals as conveyed by the GNU Project of RMS.

I  had  come  over  to  the   IIT,  in  the  first  three  months'  of
ILUG-Chennai's formation.  There  was no OSS at that  time.  There was
only the IIT,  a guy called Prabhu and another  geek outside at Adayar
called Arun K.

Do you know when the Open Source Initiative was launched ?  Prabhu,
it is time you give credit where it is due...... :)

European Union Researches the Benefits of Open Source Software
by Andy Oram
09/16/2002

Editor's Note: Andy Oram reports on the possible implications of a recent
study that explored the reasons behind the widespread use of, and support
for, free and open source software.

A major research project under the name Free/Libre and Open Source Software:
Survey and Study, or FLOSS, recently explored reasons behind the widespread
use of, and support for, free and open source software. This is, to my
knowledge, the first large-scale, rigorous study concerning any aspect of
free software. It involves interviews with thousands of developers and
hundreds of businesses, with carefully-chosen questions and a correlation of
results.

-----------------------

FN's comments: 

Don't miss this. 

Rishab Aiyer Ghosh, chief writer of the FLOSS study, <rishab@dxm.org> has
been in the Netherlands for just two years. Before that he was based in
Delhi, and closely involved in the Indian internet/telecom scene, though he
stopped writing for PCQ/DQ/Asianage in 1996. Rishab had his own newsletter,
Indian Techonomist, going out to people like Reed Hundt and Vint Cerf, and
he wrote various consultation papers on the opening up Internet policy
(especially to small providers) on the request of telecom secretaries such
as Takkar and Gokak.  Googling "Indian Telecom" still shows up his site as
two of the top four hits, even though "it's heavily cobwebbed", as Rishab
says! He's keen to find out the number of active LUG members in India too.
Is that somehow possible?

This is almost microsoft-ian in its misdirection. While MS did have a role,
netscape proved quite capable of self-destructing. Please do not color
history. 

Plus Netscape was not free either and nor was it open-source. So how
does it matter to the discussion on hand that one 'evil' software killed
another?

IOW, do we stop discussing netscape or its use in ILUGC, because
it is not GPL? Or are we to assume if it is non-MS it is okay if it is
not open source?

Subject: [Ilugc] BBCTV focuses on GNU/Linux ...
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0209211252480.634-100000@localhost.localdomain>

Red Flag Linux... national pride... more reliable... cheaper... these are
some of the keywords emerging from BBC TV ClickOnline's current program
which focuses on GNU/Linux in China, apart from other issues.

It was telecast on Saturday 21 Sept at 1200 IST (and next coming up on
Sunday 22 Sept at 1600 IST and Tues 24 Sept at 1300 IST). An interesting
programme, though as is typical of television, it only skims the surface of
the issue. (You've guessed my biases when it comes to reading, radio and TV)

"If you haven't heard of Linux, it does the same things as Windows. But
unlike Windows (its code is freely available)." That's approximately how BBC
introduces GNU/Linux. Many Free/Libre and Open Source Software enthusiasts
might cringe to hear their favourite OS being compared to Windoze.

But the programme makes the point that there are many reasons for a growing
number (even if still a small segment of total computer users) opting for
GNU/Linux in China. It's cheaper, more reliable, there are questions of
national pride (building software indigenously), China's strategy of
adopting and adapting, security flaws, and even suspicion of secret
backdoors in closed-source proprietory software....

Perhaps the progamme could have mentioned that the international journal of
the Free Software Foundation is today published from China... If
interested, contact hongfeng@gnu.org

This programme also has an interesting debate on the usual question: can
China compete with Indian software... Do we have to see everything in terms
of competition? Louisa Liu agrees that this needn't be so. 

On an offtopic subject, one learnt of a very interesting plan to teach
Internet and computing to the elderly -- the oldest student being 85. Maybe
we too could think of similar approaches. Why not? A good way of fighting
both the digital and age-bias all in one. --FN

    RB> The OSS came after Arun & you started ILUG-Chennai.  So, `By

    RB> Project of RMS.

Few points to make here:

 1. RMS did not invent freedom.  

 2. Unix existed before RMS *thought* of GNU.  And before Unix was
 commercialized etc. people exchanged code freely.

 3. How can you speak for Arun?  Unless you have some special powers
 that we dont know of.

The trouble is that people seem to use the meaning of 'free'
interchangeably with the dictionary meanings and the meaning as given
by the FSF.  This can become extremely misleading.  Ask anyone who is
not very aware of GPL etc. to define what they mean by free and they
will give you a very different interpretation.  And by that
interpretation the GPL cannot be considered truly free.

For instance, lets say you publish an idea for a toy on the web.  Now
someone takes the idea enhances it quite a bit, supports it,
advertizes it, polularizes it, bets his money and life on it, forms a
company that makes an honest living of selling your enhanced version
of the toy idea and does not give the details of the major
enhancements back to everyone on a free webpage.  If you gave the idea
freely then this would be allowed.  But if you used a FSF
interpretation of the word free, the person would never be able keep
his changes to himself.  Now there are two ways to look at it.

 1. The FSF way would be to say: that is evil.  You took my idea and
 did not give me your idea.  Fine.  This protects your idea.  But if
 the person felt, "if I give the idea out then my future is insecure
 why should I pursue the idea at all?"  Anyway there are restrictions
 and common folk would not consider that as true freedom.  This is
 like the Britishers telling India when we were freed that if we are
 free we will never do this or that (or else they will take us to
 court and spoil our fair name! ;)

 2. The free (as in dictionary meaning) would say.  Good, someone took
 the idea and made a lot of money out of it.  Good for them.  Just
 note that you can do this (without the following features) for free
 and do exactly what you want with it.

Now there are obvious pros and cons to each.  However, you cant say
that the FSF definition of free is the commonly accepted version.
Further this was a kind example.  The GPL can be notoriously
restrictive.  Lets say I have an application (that is commercial) and
make one single library call (lets say its something like printing to
screen) a to a GPL'd (not LGPL'd) library, I'd have to release *all*
my sources under the GPL simply because of that one library call!  I'm
sure you cannot say such a thing is truly free.

So back to the point, free is a pretty wide ranging word.  AFAIK we
support the wider definition of free.

    RB> Do you know when the Open Source Initiative was launched ?
    RB> Prabhu, it is time you give credit where it is due...... :)

haha.  Thats funny.  Many points here I'll restrict myself tho.

  1. Do you really believe that people started sharing software (and
  potentially other things) after RMS started the FSF?  Wow!  If you
  associate the formation of OSI with the licenses that affiliate to
  it you are destroying your own argument because the GPL license is
  also OSI approved!  Did public domain software come after RMS or
  before RMS?  Intersting we have AD/BC now we have AR and BR eh? ;)

  2. Who am I supposed to credit?  FSF?  FSF didnt write all the GPL'd
  code out there.  How about credit to individual programmers?  How
  about credit to the X11/Xfree86 folks?  How about credit to those
  who founded the Internet?  How about credit to those who wrote
  Python/Perl/Tcl/<whatever>?  How about giving credit to the BSD
  folks for the TCP/IP stack?  How about giving credit to Kernighan
  for developing C?  How about the founding fathers of Unix?  How
  about the founding fathers of computing?  How about their fathers
  and mothers and theirs?  How about God?

  If you claim that most software is licensed using GPL/LGPL based on
  this: http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc/redhat71-v1/redhat71sloc.html and
  therefore we must put GNU everywhere, then think again for I can
  argue even harder that you should include 'C' in every program name
  because more than 70% of the sources are in C!!  So how would you
  feel if Kerninghan turned around and said "Henceforth you must all
  call your groups ICLUGC.  If you don't I will not give a talk at
  your group!  Afterall I had this grand vision that programming
  should be 'free', easier and portable ..."  I think you get the
  drift.

  3. Well, since you have forgotten I was one of the blokes who
  suggested after RMS's talk that we could change references to Linux
  as GNU/Linux.  I think I also supported the move to change the name.
  However after discussion we decided to stay with the old name
  because of many reasons.  There seemed no point in changing it.  all
  this had already been discussed and decided.  The matter was put to
  rest.  Suraj suddenly seemed to get all excited once more about
  chaning the name and some comments on the list were very misleading.


So my argument is simple.

 1. All licenses have their pros and cons.  We cant say we endorse any
 one of them.  ILUGC should encourage the use of free(dictionary
 meaning) software.  I dont think commercial software should be
 shunned or thrown out.  We always enjoy freebies (even if the
 software is commercial!). ;) However as always free(dict meaning)
 software is given the highest priority and preference.  We are open
 to discussing technical things about software/hardware.  This has how
 it has been always and it has nothing to do with the FSF or RMS
 directly.

 2. ILUGC is fairly old has a name and site and many things already
 going for it.  We have always been democratic and open to all sorts
 of ideas.  We dont think it is correct to change the name at this
 stage to make it GNU centric.  This also seems the general consensus.
 I dont really trust the votes -- if we really did we should have met
 at Aminjikarai a long while ago. ;D

This is my last post on the thread (on or off the list).  I dont care
anymore what happens.  Call me names for all i care.  This does not
mean I agree with where the thread goes.  I think I have made myself
very clear.

cheers,
prabhu

Hi ILUGs,

Iam Sridhar from Chennai.
I was very excited to know such a professional useful
group exists in chennai! 
Many thanks to Ravi!

I'm much intersted in joining the ILUG family.
I'm not at all a Linux guru, not even have worked in
Linux yet. 
But I'm intersted to Learn & work in Linux.
Apart from coding, i enjoy astronomy & physics..
My interest in it grew when my client insisted to use
Linux/Unix and NOT windows! 
Now i have a problem. Being a VB developer, How do i
go about developing windows application in Linux?

I haven't worked in Linux/Unix environment before.
This medical imaging project involves socket
programming & imaging fundas.
Any good front-end available for Linux?
Which front-end should i use? Where should i start?

Some friends recommend GTK, Tcl-TK.. hmm.. I'm
confused on that :(

Could any one suggest on this?


thanks in advance,

Ten ways to promote communication within a LUG:
***********************************************************************
* Build a list of LUG speakers, and the topics they specialise on.
* List readily available GNU/Linux software, where available, and

* Set up your own website.
* Mailing-lists play an important role for communicating between meetings.
* List LUG members and contact details.
* Try to get new LUG members to introduce themselves on the mailing list.
* Expanding numbers is important
* Report regularly on LUG meetings. This build bridges to those not present.
* Plan for LUG meetings well in advance. Meetings with fixed agendas
  generally attract more people than vague, no-agenda meetings.
* If nothing else works, trying to build more mini-LUGs in your area.

yes, thats all fine; but that would be like calling some of our ministers
pakistani because they were born in undivided india in cities that would
later become part of pakistan. i have been a part of ilugc before ilugc
moved into iit campus. i dont believe ilugc subscribes to the idea of free
as equal to the 'ideals as conveyed by the gnu project of RMS.' i suspect
the philosophy is closer to the open source philosophy, but with over 500
members on the mailing list (and a good number of the good ones being
silent observers), it would be hard to pin it down. in fact, it would be
hard to pin anything down and say 'look, this is what ilugc is'. i believe
our ilugc is good because of its openness. we are open to anything, even
proprietary software. yes, we would like more people to use gnu stuff, 
linux, X, python, perl etc etc, but we are not so fanatic as to turn out 
others. we have an ulterior motive of promoting linux and thats it.

The above two were first decided but then we dropped due to reasons that
I seem to forget. Can someone refresh()? (-:

This was also planned but then dropped (again reasons that I seem to

Most of the times we end up not deciding our agenda because most of us
were busy with other work. This needs to be streamlines of the meetings
is of a major concern to the LUG. Many times the speakers too get busy
and donot turn up for the meets. Somehow we manage to tackle this
problem.. when srini was there he would talk on some tool that he knows
of (generally a PHPfoobar (-;) or prabhu might come up to talk about
something else. 

A few meets ago there used to be one genteman whose name I seem to
forget. He wanted to focus and streamline ILUGC's activities rather than
being what it is now. I personally find his idea good.

Just as how history repeats, before I became the webmaster there was
Deivanayakam B who was the webmaster of ILUGC and he too was overloaded
/ had other priorities and hence he had to quit being the webmaster and
eventually ppl found me good with gimp :D and hence i was "unanimously
chosen" as the webmaster. 

Whats webmastering all about?

 1. Not much of work to be done. About less than an hour's work per
 month. This would generally be:
   
   a. copy the previous month's minutes into a new file and replace the
   main contents with the current month's minutes; edit meetings.php and
   add a link to the current minutes; edit right.php and add a link in
   the site update section to the minutes; ftp all of this to
   chennailug.org. 

   b. Generally you have to be the minutes writer too (thats what I was
   told when I took this responsibility up). 
 
 2. But this doesn't mean you wont have much of work. Sometimes ILUGC
 might get itself into a heavy duty campaign (like the LDD2) and you
 would just have to do a lot of work. Unfortunately during my times of
 webmastering, we didn't have a database for ILUGC and hence I decided
 to use CSV databases. You might have to be "guided" through by me or
 someone who understands the whole setup at chennailug.org before you
 can start writing stuff that does DBs. Great news is that I was wanting
 to setup something like postnuke because:

   a. I felt I had other responsibilities and a feeling that I might not
   be able to webmaster ILUGC completely. So I thought it would lessen
   my burden if there can be a nice system like postnuke or whatever
   where ppl can collaboratively moderate. 
   
   b. I felt I've been that old lurker who nows is seen mostly as that
   useless-old-man (-; so I thought I would give young men a nice chance
   to webmaster (-:

 3.  Its a great learning experience when you are in this
 responsibility. I wanted to pick up PHP for the sake of having a better
 system up on our site. And I eventually fell in love with PHP (-:

 4. and you also get to do a lot of advocacy because the first contact
 person for a visitor who comes to the site is the webmaster. There
 would be a lot of requests from students/professionals asking you
 various things. Students generally ask for help on their project work.
 Corporates ask for CDs, support, etc.,

 5. There are a variety of sites where Deivanayakam and me had
 registered chennailug.org as the Official LUG of Chennai. Give me some
 time and I would be glad to change contact information on all these
 sites.

We need to figure out more things:

  a. a login for the new webmaster  
  
  b. suraj@chennailug.org and the fate of all emails to come  
  
  c. Should the existing site be replaced with something else that
  $WEBMASTER is comfortable with? I dunno, I managed to put semi-cryptic
  code on the site :-D (thanks to the use of CSV databases). However one
  point to note: "It aint broke". You can as well decide to not fix it.

<personal> 
I received a few questions from various luggies asking me if this
'stepping down' is due to the recent war that was fought over the list
(-;. The answer is simple. I'm planning to become a full-time
volunteering teacher (Thanks Thaths! You were my inspiration!). I'm
planning to quit my job in a year's time now and set out to teach free
softwares to children. I decided I have to do more ground work during
weekends/spare-time to figure out schools, their syllabi, etc.,. 

One school in my neighbourhood has already agreed to let me teach
fundamentals of computers, etc., and I would only be too glad to find
many others joining my hands. (and of course, people who can donate some
funds would be "appreciated even more" (-; (like prabhu said..
money/economy is a weird animal)).

I would continue to lurk around on this list and try and start more
flame wars and fill the gap that ravi's departure has created (-;

Hello,

If you are a VB user, then kylix would be the easiest way to switch, 
providing you know some pascal (and that's not so difficult either)
Look at : http://www.borland.com/kylix/ If you do not require to access any 
db then go for the 'free' version.

If you are familiar with sockets under other OSes then it should be 
straightforward to go to *nix. Medical imaging usually requires 10-bit, or 
12-bit imaging along with DICOM standards compatibility. Proceed with 
caution. afaik, film.gimp.org should give you a good start for 12bit images, 
but I am more or less certain that its not DICOM compatible... good luck.

> Any good front-end available for Linux?

I personally use FLTK (you need to know C/C++) check out http://www.fltk.org
ymmv.

best regards

You can also develop nice front ends on PHP-Gtk (http://gtk.php.net/)
using PHP's Gtk Bindings. This means you just need to pick up PHP and
have the php-gtk docs, samples. Although it is considered stable, there
are a lot of regions where it lags. There is no good support for GNOME
widgets and you'd end up writing your own custom widgets in such cases
(which is a pain).

hi luggies,

 There has been an overwhelming response for volunteering to demo
 GNU/Linux at SCS Matriculation school at chromepet. Currently there are
 six people on board and we think it should suffice.

 Thanks for your willingness to take part. I think we would freeze on

Hi everyone,

I have a small problem. When I installed RH 7.1, I checked the default
options and Linux was made the default boot option in Lilo. I'd like to
change that to Windows. (Ok, so thats sacrilege for a lot of people, but I
need to work).

I tried reading the man pages and changed lilo.conf, but nothing happens. I
still get Linux as the default boot. My lilo.conf is given below. Some
pointers would be appreciated.

Thanks,
mudit

You need to run lilo after you change the conf file.

# /sbin/lilo -v

Basically I want to send out mass email and archive the ones sent out for

Any thoughts/ideas will be greatly appreciated.

Make sure replace the real file name for the <filename> and make sure 
you use back quotes (`) not (') not (")

Those who wanted non-whites need to compromise on this because it seems
whites is the only thing that the printer would print for such low
rates.

Thanks somu. Can you tell me how we can start placing orders? Can we

Does your mail server allow one of the protocols supported by fetchmail?
(see end of fetchmail man page).

You can use Mailman to do this.  There might be other ways but the
nice thing about mailman is that if you do need to setup a list later
on you can always do so.

I dont remember the details on setting up MailMan but you can read the
docs that come with it.  Surely they will cover this.

However from memory all that you need to do is edit mm_cfg.py or
somesuch file inside the Mailman directory
(/var/mailman/Mailman/mm_cfg.py).  You then should run the newlist
script that is inside the /var/mailman/bin/ directory to create a new
list.  Then go to the web page and setup all the defaults.  You should
be all set.

cheers,

Dear Somu

Look  at  www.lids.org
I had installed  it last  week  after  reading  the  lug  meet  transcripts.
Latest version is  available as  a  patch for kernel  version  2.4.18 
 and above...

The  docs  on the site are  very  elaborate  and helpful.

Apply this patch if you are using 1.1.1r2.

AFAIK, only 20 accounts are allowed on chennailug.org and hence I
thought I would be a waste of space/bandwidth if I continue to use an
account. What can be done is that an alias or something can be added for
suraj@chennailug.org to suraj@symonds.net. This way a login can be
removed pour moi.

Message-ID: <014001c2647d$b72b8f10$390110ac@kursi>

Hello all,

I want to generate an IP packet with some specific data embedded to the
packet. I am successful in generating a raw IP packet and add the IP and TCP
headers to it. Now i add a custom structure(with my specific data) to the
end of the headers. This is Ok and the packet is successfully generated and
it is reaching the destination machine. But when i receive the packet with
data in the destination machine and traced using a packet sniffer, the data
part is not showing correctly. Any comments on how to adjust the outgoing
packet so that it produce the data while it is sniffed.

My requirement is as below:
1) Construct an IP header
2) Add custom payload
3) Send it
4) Run a packet sniffer in the destination machine
5) Sniff the packets
6) Extract the header and data from the packet

In the destination machine, i receive only the port information not the ip
information. I am running "netdump" in my destination machine. The output is
something like...

 DATA:   UDP: 51379 -> 2000 ..
 DATA:  DATA:   UDP: 51379 -> 2000 ....

Subject: [Ilugc] Rural computers and the RULE project
Message-ID: <20020925195325.B8493@polaris>


Hello,

I have received the message below from Mr Noronha. May I ask you to
provide some links regarding this Rural computer project, and to any
similar initiatives? I confirm that the RULE project
(www.rule-project.org) was founded exactly to help in these situations,
and we would be happy to help and work together. Please let me know
how we can support that project, we are re-starting development again
after a summer break (longer than expected, I admit...)

	Best Regards,

			Marco Fioretti
			RULE project leader

Subject: [Ilugc] Joe Ottinger: "why i can't stand the fsf" {fwd}
Message-ID: <000701c264c1$06c2a340$6401a8c0@vulcan>

=======
Why I Can't Stand the FSF I like open source. I use open source software
when it's appropriate. I write open source software, at that, and I'm happy
to do so.

That said, I really, really dislike the Free Software Foundation. When I
have a choice between their offerings and someone else's, I nearly always go
with the alternatives. I don't use their licenses. I don't defend them, or
even their goals, really. In many ways, I'm actively antagonistic.

Why?

It's pretty simple. I thought the FSF rocked until I had to deal with them
directly, and the repercussions of that interaction made me reconsider all
my assumptions.

Starting Down the Slippery Slope I was working as a consultant for IBM in
1997, on their ProductManager suite. ProductManager needed a little
language, for which I designed a grammar and lexer. When you need a compiler
compiler and a lexer, you look at packages in the yacc and lex family... and
the best of those, for C, remain the FSF's bison and Vern Paxson's flex. Not
only was I trying to do well for IBM, but I was also aiming at using the
best products available.

IBM, understandably, wanted to cover its pockets in the case of liability,
so they had me talk to the respective authors to make sure that their code
was actually theirs to give away. The reasoning was, as I understand it,
that if (say) flex incorporated some copyrighted Microsoft code, and
Microsoft discovered that IBM was using that code, Microsoft could sue both
the author of flex and IBM. However, if IBM had a signed affadavit from the
respective authors that asserted their right to distribute code, then IBM
would have done due diligence to protect itself and other companies from
illegal activity. It wouldn't have been a full defense, but would be enough
to mitigate most damage in court. (The realisation that IBM didn't expect
due diligence to be a complete shield was a blow to my faith in civil
courts, too, even though that faith was pretty weak to begin with.)

So I wrote Vern Paxson and the FSF (because Richard Stallman was listed as
the author of bison, which surprised me.) Vern got back with me after a few
hours, and said he'd be happy to sign a form for us. When I talked to him on
the phone and explained the exact situation, he reversed his position,
saying that he simply couldn't honestly say that flex had no copyrighted
code in it. He didn't think it did, but he wasn't able to get such an
assertion from each author.

That eliminated flex for our project. I didn't mind, for a few reasons: one
was that lexers are fairly trivial, and we could replace lex with something
feature-comparable; another reason was that Vern was very straightforward
about the situation. I got the feeling that he actually considered the needs
of his potential userbase.

A few hours after Vern's initial reply came back, the FSF responded, too. (I
was genuinely surprised at how rapid both responses were made.) They said
that Richard Stallman was, indeed, the author of bison, and soon we managed
to strike up a dialog with him directly.

Eventually, we were in a conference call with him. I was a little awed,
considering that I'd been using some of RMS's tools (like Emacs) for quite
some time even then. Basically, we had in mind a sort of quid pro quo, in
that we wanted an affadavit signed and he wanted a monetary grant. It was
also a chance for the FSF to score points in the courts, since the GPL
hadn't been challenged. Our reasoning was that if IBM was using the code,
and was challenged, then the FSF would be piggybacking a defense of the LGPL
from IBM's defense team.

RMS would have none of it. What we were asking for, to be clear, was an
assertion that the FSF had the right to apply their license to the software
they made available. A denial of that assertion undermines their whole
reason for being, after all, and we were certainly going to recompense the
FSF for making good software available. Instead, RMS refused outright to
sign the affadavit, and suggested quite bluntly that ProductManager (which
costed IBM millions to develop, and was a pretty vertical product) should be
open source, and we could send a check to him at this address, etc.

I was not impressed. It wasn't so much the open source spiel that bothered
me, but the refusal of the assertion. If it was my code, I'd have been happy
to say it was mine, as long as I knew (a la Vern Paxson's response). RMS,
however, didn't even entertain the thought from the impression he gave us.
Instead, he came across as a complete hypocrite, an impression confirmed
with further investigation of the FSF's policies and approach. He was
effectively implying that he'd stolen the code, and released it as open
source just to further his personal views on software source code
availability.

The Air Over There I think the FSF is on crack. They want software to be
open-sourced, as a statement of ethics, and yet they advocate strong-arming
companies in order to get what they want. They don't want the code, even -
they just want all code to be open source, and they're willing to act like
brown-shirts to do it.

If you go to their home page, for example, you see this announcement at the
end of the first paragraph:

Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the kernel Linux, are now
widely used; though these systems are often referred to as ``Linux'', they
are more accurately called GNU/Linux systems. The opening sentence for the
paragraph is "Welcome to the GNU Project web server."

Um.

Not only is the sentence about Linux inappropriate for the paragraph's
subject matter, it's retarded. Their justification is something like this:
"Linux is just the kernel, and GNU provides the rest of the system that
makes the kernel useful, so the name should be GNU/Linux instead of just
Linux."

That's idiotic. For one thing, they're targeting Linux in this, for reasons
of publicity only. (Yes, that's right, I just said the FSF was a bunch of
publicity whores.) If they were going to be fair about this, they'd apply
that reasoning to a lot of software: "GNU/Cygwin," et cetera. To my
knowledge, they don't do this. For another, they presume that GNU is central
to Linux... and it's not. I know of developers who've created Linux
distributions with BSD tools instead of GNU, for example, and the mere fact
that it's doable suggests that maybe GNU isn't as critical to Linux as the
FSF seems to suggest. Sure, maybe Linus used GNU tools to generate the
kernel. Does that mean that every Visual Basic app needs to trumpet
"MS/Whatever" as part of its name, too?

It gets worse. The FSF not only demands recognition (which, by the way, it
got plenty of already), but it actively supports piracy, offering this
newspeak as a replacement. "Use neutral terms to describe piracy," they
suggest, offering "unauthorized copying" as well as "sharing information
with your neighbor." Pardon me, fellows, for actually setting the price I
want as recompense for my effort. The freedoms the FSF supposedly tries to
work for include the rights to say "No, I wrote this with my blood, sweat,
and tears, I want $100 for it or you don't have to use it."

And that brings up another annoyance with the FSF - the GPL. The GPL is a
viral license, requiring programs that use GPLed code to be under the GPL
themselves. In a way, that makes sense, although most other similar licenses
are less militaristic;most of them respect the right of authors to keep
their code proprietary, usually requesting links to the source of licensed
software. The GPL, on the other hand, says that it's all open, and they
choose licenses accordingly.

To wit, they have a "Lesser GPL," the LGPL, which doesn't have the same
viral effect that the GPL does. The FSF has a document, called Why you
shouldn't use the Library GPL for your next library (written before the LGPL
was renamed to "Lesser GPL"), which explains that the LGPL is used where
there's no real reason to rely on the GNU offering. In other words, all the
truly useful stuff they have (and there's a good bit of it) is basically
bait for the GPL; "use GetOpt, and we have you!"

That's cowardly, in my opinion, arguing from a position of weakness.

And that's the FSF for you.

I was told that there exists an organisation called AID which helps
fishermen to use computers. Although it has nothing to do with free
softwares it does things similar to the GSCP (Goa School Computers
Project). It gets used/old computers from NRIs and donors in the US and
helps fishermen use computers/Internet to find weather information
before they dive into the seas.

Hi,

  I know that 'which perl' will give the path of the
perl.  But the issue here is, i want to pick up the
correct version of perl.  If i say 'which perl' in
command prompt and say it gives /usr/local/bin/perl.
If I do a perl -v then i will get the version.  If
that version is not the one i wanted to use then how
do i pick up the correct version of the Perl.

  I can use 'where' in 'tcsh' but then i can't use
this for 'sh' bcoz. it doesnt support that command.
  
  Also i need to pick up the CORRECT VERSION OF PERL
using A SCRIPT.

Thanx in Advance,
Prakash.

hi,
  I am using the sendmail and started the service.
when i try sending mail from other user to root the root cann't 
receive mail

for eg: when i tried from user1(and tried mail command even as a 
root )
      mail root@localhost
it states the error message "hash map Alias0 : Unsafe map file 
/etc/aliases.db : world writable directory.

I tried opening that file and cann't find any useful 
information.

next mailq states that there are lot of mails pending .

Help me to send mail to root.

was asked the root password and when i type the root password i 
will get a prompt

and i tried the following in sequence
1)mount -t proc /proc /proc
2)mount -o remount,rw /
3)fsck /
4)cd /dev and tried ./MAKEDEV /dev/null which will create the null 
devices and other devices,etc.
5)reboot

even then i am getting the same error .
  Help me to recover from that error.

Hi,

I hope the following examples would suffice your need.

#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Perl Version ->", $], "<- \n";

or 

#!/usr/bin/perl
use VERSION;
print "Perl Version ->", $PERL_VERSION, "<- \n";

For more info., go through "man perlvar".

	Yes, anyone can download it. AFAIK, RedHat is GPL'ed stuff, so even
though the kernel they run for instance, is not whats on kernel.org, they
*do* release the sources, and carrying GPL'ed software on burnt CDs to LUG 
meets is not a violation of the GPL, from what I know.

it would appear that you have /etc directory set to world writable.  this
is a terrible thing. this means that anyone on your machine can delete
your, say, /etc/aliases.db and replace it with one that redirects all mail
to them (and then use a script to read the mail and selectively forward to
actual users as needed etc etc). recent versions of sendmail will refuse 
to run if they find this type of bad directory setup. well, with a world 
writable /etc, i can do even more damage like replacing /etc/passwd etc. 
you need to chmod go-w /etc/ to fix this.

probably because aliases.db is in db form and not a text file?

may be related to the same problem. sendmail will not run with very bad 
directory permissions that are likely to compromise system security 
through mail.

sriram

ps: how did you get such strange setup on your machine? missing /dev/null 
and world writable /etc/? has someone broken into your machine?

Add a seperate Directory section and enable the ExecCGI option.

<Directory /wherever/your/files/are/present>
	options ExecCGI
</Directory>

The above example also assumes that you have the following line: 

AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl .phtml .py .fooscript

This would enable you to execute scripts outside your ScriptAlias
directories. (Read it all! the apache documentation has it all!)

    designs will be printed if and only if the count for each design
    reaches 90 or so.

    Just reply to this mail giving all the details which will get
    recorded in my database.


    Cheers!!!
    Somu & Suraj

To all those who replied to ILUGC and not to somu.  Please think
before you post a message to this list.  Such messages should be sent
to the concerned perspn and **NOT** to ilugc.  There are over 550
members on this list.  Telling them all your choice of T-shirt is not
appropriate and is a huge waste of bandwidth.
