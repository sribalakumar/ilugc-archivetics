Hi !

There is a good side to everything !


Financial Crisis Offers Opportunity for Linux, Open Source

Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, says
technologies such as Linux and open-source software can help
enterprises cut costs during tough economic times. Zemlin says users
should look to open source and Linux, systems management tools, and
virtualization technology to keep budgets in line.

Hello,

I found the following post regarding Linux jobs which people may find
interesting. The recommendation of the head-hunter is that you should
contribute to a project which you feel enthusiastic about. (So what's
new some of you might say!)

thats a given - when I speak to students on FOSS I just tell them - if your 
code is up in some repo, you do not need to apply for a job - they will come 
to you. And you do not need to sit for seven rounds of interview, nor do you 
need to give references. The biggest problem for a recruiter is to find out 
if the candidate *really* wrote the code for that long list of projects in 
the resume. In an open source repo, that is a no-brainer. And a perusal of 
mailing list posts by the candidate will give all the remaining info. (which 
is why no one will offer me a job after seeing my posts in this LUG list ;-))

This is a question i had for a long time.. with out a solution... how will
shred work on a disk subsystem? Does any body have experience with this .. i
mean  on a disk array like Clarion or HP MSA ..  these arrays usually  do
not  repeat the command in its intended purpose.. how do we  successfully
use "shred"
on them??

Raj,

shred is not guaranteed to work on all filesystems. In fact, it will not 
work on journaled file systems like ext3fs, reiserfs or on RAID arrays 
etc. It would work on simpler filesystems.

It is usually used to shred a entire partition rather than one file.

SAN storage vendors implement data shredding as a part of their data
security feature set.  The other security features are immutability, logging,
auditing, etc.  These features are implemented in the disk controller itself,
and therefore they work as intended.

All:

A lot of people have noticed that unlike in previous years, we are not as
loud about FOSS.IN as we usually are. Now that the Call for Participation
is about to be published, it is time to explain why FOSS.IN/2008 is going
to be different from earlier incarnations.

First a quick reminder: FOSS.IN/2008 happens November 25-29, 2008, in
Bangalore, India. The website is at http://foss.in.

EVENT FOCUS
-----------

FOSS.IN has never been about advocacy, or philosophical discussions. While
such discussions may have their place, they steal valuable bandwidth when
it comes to getting things done. Especially here in India, where we tend
to lean towards political and religious aspects more easily than we tend
to roll up our sleeves and get some work done, it is important to
understand that FOSS.IN is meant to achieve tangible results.

With this in mind, FOSS.IN/2007 (last year's event) did not accept talks
that did not deliver practical, technical knowledge related to FOSS. And
the talks had to be delivered by actual contributors to the project being
discussed.

Also, FOSS.IN is NOT a newbie event. A "newbie" is defined as someone who
has no skills or knowledge or experience that would allow him or her to
immediately contribute to FOSS development. As has been repeatedly
explained to anyone who would listen - there are lots of newbie oriented
events all through the year, all over India, and people should be geting
their introductions to FOSS and their initial learning at such events,
including at user group meetings.

However, I personally was still unhappy with last years' results. Despite
the fact that we made it clear that we did not want to see elementary
stuff being covered at FOSS.IN, many of the talks were just that. The
Projects Days were very popular, but FOSS.IN is not about popularity, it
is about results.

And the bottom line is that while there was a measureable increase in
people getting involved in FOSS contribution, the quality left a lot to be
desired. Most new contributors focused only on low hanging fruit, such as
translations, and distro-specific packaging. If people got involved with
code, it was usually bug fixes and code maintenance.

While all these activities are extremely important, they do not need an
event like FOSS.IN to be triggered off - these are things one can get
involved with instantly, without really asking anyone, or attending a
talk.

FOSS.IN is far more ambitious, and is definitely not meant to cater to the
equivalent of "outsourcing" code/package maintenance.

Our event is meant to highlight Indian contribution to Free and Open
Source Software - not just bug fixes, but real code contributions, real
innovation, real projects.

Last year, we changed the event slogan from

               "Technology for a Free World"

(that we had used since Linux Bangalore/2001) to Linus Torvalds' immortal
oneliner:

               "Talk is Cheap, Show Me the Code"

This, in no uncertain terms, firmly declares the focus of FOSS.IN.

Effective this year, FOSS.IN will focus on developers, and results. It
will highlight credible efforts by people in India contributing to FOSS,
and will bring together developers at peer level, to allow them to
interact, discuss, develop and deliver.

"Delivery" does not mean mere bug fixing. Delivery will be new features to
existing applications, completely new subsystems (e.g. file systems,
device drivers, etc.), (re)design of systems and applications, etc.

Now I understand that many people will feel left out. There will be howls
from the detractors about us abandoning the basis for Free and Open Source
Software, and us being "Anti-FOSS". This is because in their minds, we
must always cater only to beginners, and "bring more people into the
fold".

Thank you, but that line of thinking was old when someone said that "Linux
is cancer" and "Anti-American" (and I think there were a few chairs
involved, too). Just because we choose to do things differently does not
mean that we are doing it wrong.

Yes, we realise that this will reduce the number of people who may come to
the event. Maybe we will be 500 people, maybe 1000. But that is OK. We are
trying to produce results that are measurable by our yardsticks
(active/increased contributors out of India), not those invariably used by
others ("4.91 quantillion participants").

At FOSS.IN/2008, we want to see the best of the best from India. We want
to see the people who actually write the code, and who ARE contributing,
interact face to face with their peers from across the world. And at the
end of the event, we want to be able to publish results. *REAL* results.
And the names of the people involved. *PEOPLE*, not companies.

Over the five days between November 25th to 29th, we are going to change
the way the world perceives India in the context of Free and Open Source
Software.

EVENT FORMAT:

So how are we going to do this?

First of all, we are dropping the talks.

Yes, you heard that right.

No talks.

Well, no generic talks, bunched back to back.

This year, there will be talks only in the big 750 seater hall. There will
be an opening and a closing keynote each day, by a well known FOSS
contributor (except the closing keynote on the last day, which, by
tradition, is a non-FOSS, but related, talk). We already know who the
event opening keynote speaker will be, and the closing keynote speaker,
and I will introduce them as we get closer to the event.

Between the keynotes, there will be 3-5 talks through the day - again,
only in the 750 seater. These will in general be talks by important
FOSS contributors or FOSS project leads. They can/will be of variable
length, but in general between 45 to 75 minutes long. They will be
carefully chosen to ensure that maximum value is delivered to the
audiences.

SPOTLIGHT ON INDIAN CONTRIBUTORS
--------------------------------

FOSS.IN is about highlighting and encouraging Indian contributions to
FOSS. But along the way, the "Indian" part of FOSS.IN's mandate has been
kind of lost. When we look at last year's speaker/talk lineup, the number
of international speakers is overpowering. Almost all talks in "prime
slots" were by non-Indians, and the number of Indian contributors
presenting talks was seriously low.

This year, this is going to change, and dramatically so.

While there will certainly be a international speakers at FOSS.IN, the
spotlight will be on Indian contributors. And if we don't have enough of
them submitting talks - well, then we will just have fewer talks.

So then what happens in the other halls?

That, ladies and gentlemen, is where history will be made.

FOSS WORKOUTS
-------------

In each of the smaller halls, as well as across the venue campus
(including the lawns, the corridors, the BoF tents, and the cafeteria),
you will find small groups of people.

Really smart people.

Really, really smart people.

People who will huddle together, use the facilities available to them,
discuss, and code.

Each hall will be equipped with its own wifi and cabled network setup, a
local server serving up the latest git/svn/bzr/whatever repositories of
code, the tools and the bandwidth. Everything that these people need to
get cracking.

In the afternoon of the first day, after the inauguration, these groups
will meet to decide on their broad and specific objectives. They will
already have interacted over the weeks leading up to the event, and once
they have finalized things on day 1, they will use the next four days to
change the world.

Only people with laptops, and a clear understanding of the tools, and a
clear understanding of the project, will be able to participate in these
hacking sessions. If you don't have a laptop, or don't know anything about
FOSS or the tools or the project, don't bother sitting in, you will just
get in the way. To join the group, you need to have FOSS credibility, code
to show that you have written, that proves that you can deliver. If you
ave never written FOSS code before, then this is not a place you want to
be.

In general, we do not expect more than about 10-15% of each hall being
occupied, in some cases, it could be as few as 4 people. Given that we
have three formal halls (apart from the 750 seater), with seating
capacities of 120, 90 and 60 people, we dont expect to see more than
12-18, 9-14 or 6-9 people in each of these halls. Hall marshalls will
ensure that things are left undisturbed, and that people inside have
everything they need - projector, whiteboards, bandwidth, connectivity,
etc.

To ensure that the sessions are undisturbed throughout the day, yet
"visible" to the people outside the halls, giant Plasma screens will
display what's happening inside, both in terms of camera video, as well as
what is being shown on the projector in the hall.

These screens will also be listing out the objectives of each group, and
their progress. This information will be available across the venue,
including on the venue LAN and on IRC, which will have channels for each
group/project, and will allow people not inside the halls (or at the
event) to participate (where feasible). The hall marshal(s) will monitor
the channels to alert the group inside if something would be worthy of
their attention.

And these groups won't just be in the halls.

FOSS EVERYWHERE
---------------

There is a reason why we will be gently cooking your brains with a massive
flood of wifi.

It is to allow people to remain connected anywhere they are on the
premises. And this means that if a group wants to sit on the lawn and
work, they can. If they want to sit on the steps of the lobby, they can.
If they want sit in the parking lot, they can. If they want to spread
themselves across the venue, keeping in touch via IM and IRC, they can. If
they want to sit in on one of the few talks in the 750 seater hall, and
continue working, they can.

If a bunch of people need to learn a new programming technique, or learn
about agile programming in FOSS - grab a tent, and get cracking. Or if you
want to reverse engineer the latest device driver over coffee and snacks -
by all means do.

And this is where the major aspect of FOSS.IN comes out and stretches in
the sunlight:

FOSS.IN is supposed to be a meeting ground for existing and potential FOSS
contributors, so that they can put faces to IRC nicks, discuss, interact,
collaborate, plan, debug, etc. all through the event.

We want people to come to FOSS.IN with definite goals in mind, and fulfil
them at the event. Whether it is improving an existing project, launching
a new one, brainstorming with your peers, with international participants,
etc. We want to see high-intensity FOSS contribution happening, or being
seeded, in the 750 seater hall, the corridors, the BOF tents, the lawns,
the lobbies, etc.

So what happened to Project Days?

PROJECT DAYS -> PROJECT OF THE DAY:
-----------------------------------

An important aspect of FOSS.IN is Project Days - one FOSS project per
hall per day.

Last year, we had set apart two days exclusively for PDs, and eight
projects were covered in the process.

Unfortunately, while the selected projects themselves were pretty happy,
we weren't. Complaints of mildly condescending, talk-down presentations,
blatant commercial positioning, and no real take-home from some of the
sessions, has led us to believe that this approach wasn't optimal.

In addition, we seem to have split audiences last year - some people
coming for the PDs, some for the Main Conference.

So this year, there won't be separate Project Days. Instead, every day of
the 5 days, there will be a "Project of the Day" in the cavernous 250
seater hall - the Project Hall, where talks, discussions, BoFs, etc.
related to that project will happen.

And if the people handling that Project of the Day don't do things right -
well, then their audiences will have the choice of other things to do,
other talks to attend.

The selection of "Project of the Day" will be based on normal talk
submissions, along with a "Letter of Intent" by someone from the project
saying that s/he would like to have their project as a PoD. We will then
consider that request, taking into account the talks submitted related to
that project.

OTHER STUFF
-----------

You will have noticed by now that FOSS.IN/2008 is going to be very, very
different from any conference you have been to before. It will certainly
be interesting (we have a number of things planned for every day, so that
if you decide to be picky and only attend some days, you lose out
MAJORLY).

We are STILL in negotiation with the Indian Institute of Science (the
venue owners) to allow us to make the event a little more human - simple
things, like being able to have coffee machines active throughout the day,
and to allow some simple, light Indian entertainment to show our foreign
participants a bit of our culture.

But if we fail to be allowed to bring the event to 21st century,
international standards, then we encourage people to provide their own
entertainment. We'll try and arrange for a few guitars, bongos and
keyboards for informal use in the community centre (the big, flat,
three-sides-open, carpeted, roofed area behind the venue).

THE EXPO
--------

Last year, we had FOSS projects tucked away near the big hall, to exhibit
their stuff.

This year, make sure you have clean jeans on - we are taking the FOSS EXPO
up front, right into the main lobby, alongside the sponsor stalls.

Remember the huge Platinum Sponsor stalls last year? Well, that entire
area will now be the FOSS Expo, as will some areas in the central area
between the 60 and 90 seater halls and the steps leading up to the 750
seater.

FOSS community/projects only - no commercial exhibits allowed.

THE CFP
-------

The call for participation, which isn't very different from what you have
just read, just a little shorter, and a little clearer on some points,
will go out tomorrow. Because of the nature of the changes to the event,
registration will be very different for "speakers".

Since we are going to have so few talks (including keynotes, no more than
5-7 each day), we are going to accept only about 35 talks. So you bet that
we expect them to be high calibre. We are going to research each talk
proposal, look at the bonafides of the speaker, the history each one has.
Any speaker who looks remotely corporate ("you must get involved in this
project because my company is so great") gets /dev/null'd immediately. Any
talk that doesn't look technical enough quickly follows. And a talk by a
non-Indian speaker makes it only if there is no Indian contributor
offering to talk about the topic. And don't even bother submitting a talk
that is basically a computer science topic, with no relation to FOSS.

Shortlisted talks will be run past serious developers and contributors
from across the world - you know who you are. If a talk doesn't cut it
with them, it doesn't cut it with us.

Basically, we want you to respect the event focus, and the audiences. Dont
expect newbie audiences - so expect to get deep comments and questions.
and people voting with their feet and walking out on you. If we see a talk
going south, or becoming commercial (like one guy did last year during the
Debian PD), we are going to embarrass the hell out of you and yank you off
the stage. Even if you work for a sponsor organization.

Speaking of which...

FUNDING THE EVENT:
-----------------

One of the bigger problems that we (Team FOSS.IN) face every year is
chasing sponsors.

You see, the cost of everything is up. The venue gets more and more
expensive every year, cost of travel is through the roof, and even simple
things like printing are more expensive.

But we have sworn that we will stick with with our low cost model for
participation - which is why delegates just pay Rs.600 (Rs.500 for
bonafide students, Rs.2500 for corporate delegates), which pays for their
food and goodies.

This means that while "income" (as delegate fees can laughably be called)
remains fixed, we need to make up the deficit with (you guessed it) more
sponsor money. And that means more sponsor chasing, which in turn means
more sponsor demands (which we don't give in to), which leads to more
stress on everyone, which no one needs.

Clearly, we need to change a few things to balance things out, and since
we cannot reduce the venue fees, it means that this year, we have to
reduce the allocation for international speaker travel, which is the
second largest figure after the venue costs.

Instead, we are going to ask employers, community and commercial
organizations to pitch in to help speakers from outside India to come to
the event. It will be up to speakers to check if they will be able to get
travel sponsorship.

This is a major change from previous years, where we had to bend over
backwards to raise tens of thousands of dollars to help selected speakers
to come to India. This year, that simply won't be possible. The economic
climate is miserable, the Indian Rupee is 47 INR to the USD, and rising
sharply.

We will, of course, still provide accommodation to all our outstation
speakers. We are proud of our reputation of being excellent hosts, and no
speaker has ever had any complaints in this department. So if a speaker is
selected, and tells us that s/he has funding to come to the event, s/he
can expect to be put up in the comfort that speakers at FOSS.IN are
accustomed to.

We are going to try and talk to a few airlines and maybe they will sponsor
some tickets in exchange for being tagged the Official FOSS.IN/2008
Airline. And we are talking to our employers to help as well.

But otherwise, we are going to raise just enough sponsorship to cover
event facilities and hospitality. We are NOT a commercial event, and don't
want to make finances the major focus, eating up all our time.

We are also levelling out sponsorship slabs - just two types, Gold (with a
stall in the front lobby) and Silver (with a stall near the Community
Centre).

And we are actually lowering sponsorship rates, to encourage more sponsors
to come in. And we are going to be picky as well. If you aren't a
recognised FOSS-friendly/supportive organization, you really don't want to
be at this event. Your employees will tell us if you are a good fit for
our event. And if you are on the sponsor roster, it will be like a
certificate of authenticity - A Genuine FOSS-Friendly Organization.

We are doing this because we don't want the FOSS community to feel
exploited or targeted. And we are levelling out sponsorships to avoid what
has happened before - one sponsor grabbing all the limelight. Not
happening again. We love our sponsors, but we love them equally.

Yes, we know that we sound unrealistic, even idealistic. But we want to
raise this event to quality levels that exceed anything anywhere else. And
by that we mean in terms of results, not glitz. We won't have hostesses
escorting speakers to the stage. We aren't going to have receptions for
celebrity speakers, where the twist and turn in the limelight for the
press. We aren't going to raise huge sponsorship, just to spend it back on
the sponsors. This is a community event. Please recognise that.

We are FOSS.IN, and we are going to help change the world.

For such systems one approach is to create an encrypted block device
which uses this device as the base block device. You don't even need
to remember the passphrase!

After creating the encrypted device. say /dev/mapper/encrypt you
can run

 dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/encrypt

Like shred, you can run this command multiple number of times to
ensure that all magnetic memory is also erased.

Kapil.

In US, for some kinds of "shred"ing, you are supposed to overwrite it 
with random bit patterns before overwriting with delete. I do not know 
the exact physics of it.. but it looks like data forensics is getting a 
lot advanced and simple overwriting by zeros is just not enough for all.

Hello all, this is my first post in ilugc.I am a final year engineering
student and am 6-7 months old to linux and thoroughly loving it.I am also
interested in process and scheduling related stuff so we are planning to do
a project on improvement of the CFS scheduling algorithm, latest to  kernel
version like 2.6.26.5. I know I have much to learn and I am willing to do
so.This project needs to be submitted in the april of next year and bearing
in mind our newness to linux we have started now by compiling the kernel
version 2.6.26.5 and beginning with the book "Understanding the linux
kernel".I just wanted to ask if in case I hit a roadblock will someone be
ready to guide me through my problem. Thanks and regards to all of you.

Which is why I suggested using an encryption layer on top of the
block device. Then "writing zeroes" would become "writing random
data"!

Of course, "shred" also fills with specific patterns which are
supposed to make the disk lose its magnetic memory. I can't see any
way to do this for RAID disks except to write to each disk separately.

This is interesting. I'm not a developer, but my two cents will be: it's
best to contact Ingo Molnar (CFS maintainer) and his team for guidance.

Best,

This is a very good suggestion. However, the following point should
be kept in mind:

 Linux is not a toy --- it is meant to work

This means that work on any portion of the kernel will receive
support from the LKML only if this work is actually to intended to
produce a working result and is sufficiently well-documented to
enable long-term maintainence.

I give this warning since projects are often meant to test out
certain ideas about operating systems. Such work is also valuable but
usually needs to be done outside of LKML.

Regards,

Kapil.

May I suggest that you use a currently maintained release of Fedora - 
Fedora 9/8. Rubygems is already available in the repository for the 
current releases and just a yum install away

# yum info rubygems
Loaded plugins: refresh-packagekit
Available Packages
Name       : rubygems
Arch       : noarch
Version    : 0.9.4
Release    : 2.fc10
Size       : 496 k
Repo       : rawhide
Summary    : The Ruby standard for packaging ruby libraries
URL        : http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/

If you are using it on a server, you should definitely get in touch with 
the administrator to upgrade. Running a server with a release that does 
not get security updates for a long time now is not a bright idea.

If you still want to use a older release, rebuilding a source RPM from a 
newer release is possible though possibly trickier.

As a rule, you don't really have to depend on your OS' version of 
rubygems. Plus, you're using a very old version of RubyGems. Please 
consider upgrading to a newer version. You can just download the latest 
from here:

http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/43985/rubygems-1.3.0.tgz

Untar it, and run "ruby setup.rb" as root. You're done. You can check 
the rubygems version with gem -v. You can read this guide for more info:

http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3

rdoc is part of the standard ruby distribution, so you'll have to depend 
on your OS' way of installing it. I haven't touched Fedora in ages, so 
I'm not sure how you would go about doing it... yum install ruby-rdoc?

My favorite is prozilla. It is the frontend to a command line tool
called proz. Try it.

Well phrased questions are always answered. If you can isolate and
localize the problem and then ask specific question with all the
required details, you are most likely to be answered all the time. Such
ability to define the right questions comes from a habit of
debugging programs in a structured approach. Wish you all the best and I
hope this book should help
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html.

I haven't ever met any college student who wants to work on a scheduler
algorithm with a linux kernel. I am willing to give any help you may
need for testing/implementing your algorithm .

Message-ID: <d16b1c80810020048s637fe8f3y1ff23c63d87b18bd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The following is from india-gii; Can anyone from ILUG-C coordinate this meet?

=== BEGIN ===

I would be delighted to run sessions in LUGs, and/or short seminars,
if interest arises.

I'll be based in Chennai, and for sure I would like to spend some time
in Auroville.

Do you have any contact with the "bunch of wireless, tech and art
enthusiasts" (sounds very nice!) there?

I'm in India to get a first impression of the FOSS and ICT scene
there, so I would like to move around too.

If there is opportunity to meet FOSS people or groups, I'm available
to come to Mumbai too (actually, I would like to :-) ).

BTW, I'm almost to release two opensource channel drivers for
Asterisk, one for driving gsm cellphones and one for driving the Skype
client. So, I can speak or teach about the channels, about Asterisk
development, or about opensource software development at large. I can
also teach and speak about the business planning and evaluation of ICT
and FOSS ventures, but maybe that's not so interesting to a LUG
audience ;-).

Following is a short bio and attached is a cv.

-----
Giovanni Maruzzelli (born 1964) has 15+ years of experience with open
source, industrial grade operations, and ICT startups (both at the
investor or investee side). Industry experience includes publishing
engines, open source messaging and networking, document indexing and
retrieval systems, unified messaging.

Giovanni primary skill is producing solutions that are "reality based"
and business wise.

A member of the worldwide open source community for over twelve years,
Giovanni is the proud owner of the Mysql license n.1, and as a
speaker, trainer and magazines writer he was instrumental to the
introduction of Internet, Unix, Linux and open source to the Italian
technical public.

In the beginning of the Internet era, Giovanni was one of the founders
of Italia Online, the most popular Italian portal and consumer ISP,
and architect of its Internet technologies - www.iol.it Then
supervisor of Internet operations and architect of the first engine
for paid access to www.ilsole24ore.com, the most read financial
newspaper in Italy and to its databases (migrated from mainframe).

After that, he was CEO of venture capital funded Matrice, developing
Telemail unified messaging and multi language phone access to email
(Text To Speech), and CTO of incubator funded Open4, an open source
managed applications provider.

As a partner In3 fund Giovanni has often evaluated the technical and
financial soundness of submitted business plans.

Then he was for two years in Serbia as Internet and Telecommunication
Investment Expert for World Bank - IFC.

Giovanni is now consulting and is based in Milan, Italy.

There are lots of sites that don't report the Content-Length HTTP
header or support the Byte-Range  request feature.  The latter is
required for downloading specific chunks.  That might be one reason
for the failure to resume downloads in some cases. If you mouse over
the file name during the initial download and it doesn't display any
chunks, then it probably means a site that does not support one of the
above features or both.

You can get gwget www.gnome.org/projects/gwget/
or kget if you're using KDE

Both of them are really good, but I prefer kget even if I use GNOME :D

One great hurdle that a normal user feels awkward towards the gnu/ linux
community is, 'people in community looks forward to an user also as a
developer'...

and gnu/ linux is all about geeks paradise.. which off-course Ubuntu broke
;-)... i hope an event with such an objective will fail in making that
notion stronger...

an event which appear to be a whole of an Indian event by its very name,
should have way for activists (not talkies) on all segments (which
off-course includes developers also showing/ revealing  the code & looked up
at and respected as great geeks ;-))..

hmm..

Hi!

Load Virtual Box and from there you can play with other OS.

www.virtualbox.org

It is easy and very good tool for Virtualization.

Post your experiences.

Of course, you can install Windows after installing GNU/Linux but you 
need to reinstall Grub to get dual booting possible. You can install 
Grub with any distribution's live CD. Use a search engine and you should 
be able to find how.

Btw, please use a meaningful subject line related to your query 
(something like "installing Windows after installing Linux") and search 
the mailing list archive/search engine to find answers before asking it 
here.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

md5sum -- Compute and Check MD5 Check sums.

Summary:

`md5sum' computes a 128-bit checksum/fingerprint/message-digest for
each specified file.  `md5sum' can also determine whether a file &
checksum are consistent.

Example:

$ md5sum file -- Compute and print the MD5 checksum of that file.

$ md5sum -c input.txt -- Read checksum and filename from the file and 
                         validate checksums.

$ md5sum -w -c input.txt -- Same as above and warn if the checksums 
                            format is wrong in the file.

$ md5sum --status -c input.txt -- Indicate the status in exit status 
                                  code.

Read: man md5sum

input.txt Format:-

787e64182f251c0b877f734cbe77d987  file1
be7b28e15963d38e05591118cfe049d2  file2

   Which option will be used in find or grep command to search the exact &
particular word in a file.if u reply me with a example it will be very
useful for me..

for example :
             if we give *grep raja /etc/passwd* means it must show only the
exact string  raja .it must not show all raja occurances in the file like
rajan,nagarajan, etc,.....

grep -F 'exact search string' file

This will work if your string does not contain the ' character.

I realise that this is not what the question was about.

grep -F is used when one wants string matches _without_ regular
expressions. However, if the given string occurs as a substring it
will match.

Please provide the following information:
 a. Is the machine being booted from the Hard disk?
    Or is it being booted from the CD?
 b. Are you using Lilo? or Grub?
 c. Is kernel booting at all?

Message-ID: <467c0a9a0810030522j6f07f16cjbb6bdf7662c01e68@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I use a simple/brute force system to clone linux systems. I basicaly use it
to create "all apps installed system". OpenSUSE 10.3 is the base. From the
master system, I just tar the entire file system leaving out 'proc' and
'sys'. In the target system, I use a live CD distrubution to boot, format
and untar the master file system to the hard disk (I have the huge tar file
in a pen drive). After untar, I create the proc and sys directories and then
run grub and setup the system to boot.

This was working fine even when the target system used a different hardware
setup. Now for a particular motherboard (VIA based), the kernel while
booting displays the following message-
waiting for device /dev/sda1 to appear......
This waits for a long time and tries to fallback on the second partition
(swap) which also fails.
Googling did not give much info.

what could be the problem? When I use OpenSUSE rescue mode, the ide driver
"via_pata" is loaded. Is it possible to load this via_pata module during
boot (before init)?

Your initrd needs to have the via_pata drive included.  The simplest
trick is to try reinstalling the kernel on the target machine.  Kernel
package install hooks will rebuild the initrd image - hopefully with the
via_pata driver included.

Failing this, you'll have to read mkinitrd(8) and friends on how you
can manually build an initrd image with via_pata included.

This does not seem to be a clean way of doing things. 

I have not really understood the full implications or thought through
the process you are following.

If I were you I would go with a formal method of cloning like
dump/restore. That always works in *BSD though you have to install the
boot loader separately. I see that there is a dump/restore for linux as
well (search in sf.net).

There are other slower ways like dd(1).

Thanks! Worked like magic.
I did not reinstall the kernel,
I used a Live CD to boot and then chroot to the hard disk. Then ran mkinitrd

Yeah, I know that this is not probably the most elegant way of making a
clone, but is there any problems you foresee with the process? Reliability
or security issues?

Does this work for hard disks of different size/architecture? Also now, I
have the conveniance of carrying a compressed tar of 620 MB in a pen drive.
The file system inflates to less than 2GB. I assume dd will copy the entire
40GB or 80GB of hardisk?

Hello,

Kartik asked how we can make a tasty sandwich out of the Omelette. So
here goes.

First some philosophy ... (with apologies to Atul Chitnis; skip to
the end for the Debian Workout)

Yesterday I spoke at FOSS Shaastra and as I spoke I realised 
that some people in the audience:

 - had difficulty in understanding talks/documentation --- partly due
 to language/context issues and partly because they are "tech" types
 who feel more comfortable with action rather than words.

 - did not follow the debates and philosophy much --- again partly due
 to language issues and partly because the context of many
 discussions is a legal system which we do not have.

 - did not have basic familiarity with the "tools of the trade" like
 VCS, build-tools, profilers, debuggers even though they have done
 some coding in languages like C/C++/Java/Python.

So, I think that Atul Chitnis may be right about some things --- which
is to go towards technical aspects rather than philosophical ones, but
may be wrong to think that people are ready to write new projects.[^1]

[^1]: Anyone who codes without some understanding of the tools is
likely to "piss (smelly) code" (to use a phrase that was used by
"bubulle" on IRC yesterday). Djkstra once said that most (bad)
programmers spend 5 minutes "bugging" and the rest of their life
debugging.

Enough of philosphy ...

What I would like to see ...

I don't really see enough events that would be directed at the
*hands-on* exploration sessions of systems running GNU/Linux to:

 - use patch-systems, VCS to manage projects
 - use automated build systems to build packages
 - use profilers and debuggers to find/fix bugs

It is true that this could happen at user group meetings as well; but
I am not sure that it _is_ happening. Perhaps this should even be
happening in colleges but I suspect not!

> First of all, we are dropping the talks.

I think this is actually a good idea from my experience as mentioned
above.

So here is an idea for a FOSS Workout for Debian:

 - On day one we do a Debian lenny install-fest with a difference.
   The install will be virtual --- schroot or qemu or uml or xen or
   vserver.... Specifically, the install will not disturb the existing
   installation on the system and if possible will avoid a
   reboot! Moreover, this install will be like a developer
   install --- it will have all the build-essential and possibly
   debhelper, pbuilder, quilt, gdb.

 - On day two we use this install to explore. Basically, people can
   build/test their own personal .deb packages/repositories. These can be
   based on merely getting Debian source packages and building with
   some options or minor changes or can even be attempts to solve
   RFP's. The additional difference is that since some of the emulations
   will be slow, we will have a remote pbuilder setup for people to do
   builds. (I will try to get this up and running at IMSc. I believe
   Anibal used to have one such. I will ask for help as required.)

 - On day three we will use the same install for a bug squashing
   party which could include RFP, RFA bugs as well. We could also
   look for (real code!) writing better build tools so as to make
   such events easier to set up.

Requirements from the participants:

 0. A (strong) desire to code/patch with/for Debian (or a derived distro).

 1. A machine. Perhaps someone can look for sponsorship for this
 angle as well. We can even use pretty thin clients here so even
 an EEE pc or EEE box or HCL Mileap would do.

 2. Possibly some portable disk space in case the machines have too
 little disk space or if they need to "carry away" their install (if
 the machines they use are rented).

To test out all these ideas, we could do a run of this at IMSc,
Chennai around early November.

Tell me what you think.

Regards,

Kapil.

P.S. FOSS Shaastra guys sorry I didn't think of this earlier. We
could've implemented it at the HackFest!

Awesome idea, +1 to join in. But can't we have it around Diwali time 
because some of us who are out of Chennai might wish to participate and 
most probably can make use of the holidays to make it to Chennai (or is 
there any holidays in November?) :)

The only problem with Diwali time is that I may not be able to setup
the remote pbuilder by then. Other than that it ought to be fine with
me.

Clonezilla does cloning of different size of HHDs (80GB to 160GB). I tried
it. GRUB re-installation is also possible with clonezilla. If it is
possible  to use 'mkinitrd' and others, then it is very easy one.

This is very easily done with the at(1) command.

For instance if you wish to shutdown at 2:45 am once, then

# at 02:45 <ENTER>
shutdown -hP now
<Ctrl-D>
< ...output from at snipped...>

#

What I showed within <> markers are the key presses that you have to
manually do. ;)

Now if you wish to do it daily then crontab -e will suit you fine.

45	02	*	*	*	/sbin/poweroff

of some such line in crontab will do fine.

Best,
Girish

and then Remove the cable and re-plug

again give the dmesg -c, they said it works this time

i get same bug ti_usb_3410_5052: probe of 1-1:1.0 failed with error -5,

Message-ID: <ed2d3c000810051011k6e14a851v44bc691537ca1c9f@mail.gmail.com>

Friends,

I surfed though the net in finding the source code of gcco compiler.
While gcco compiler is based on gcc , i learnt that the company
(opentv) has obligation to release the source code under GPL norms.
There were some queries which were been raised way back in 2002/03 in
many forums including slashdot. The were some legal battles between
FSF and opentv. Till now no concrete answers for this.That brings to a
big question whether this case is pushed beneath the carpets.

According to  http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/qECCd2x743n32T/The-Legend-of-Linksys.xhtml
 "In 2002, the FSF engaged in a GPL enforcement action against OpenTV,
a San Francisco company that ships a set-top box containing Linux.
According to Forbes, OpenTV ended up paying the FSF $65,000. But
OpenTV also reportedly complied by making available the requested
code, so the purpose of the payment is unclear. The FSF's stated
mission is not to demand money damages for GPL violations."


any more information on this, please do share.

Chennailug can also take a clue from the walk and think about some

How do we reach out to more schools and colleges? How can we use

excellent example and I hope to see similar initiatives from other

=============================

sha1sum - Compute & Check Secure Hash Algorithm Std 1 message digest.

Summary:

`sha1sum' computes a 160-bit checksum/fingerprint/message-digest for
each specified file.  `sha1sum' can also determine whether a file &
checksum are consistent. The sums are computed as per the FIPS-180-1
[http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip180-1.htm].

Example:

$ sha1sum file -- Compute and print the MD5 checksum of that file.

$ sha1sum -c input.txt -- Read checksum and filename from the file and 
                          validate checksums.

$ sha1sum -w -c input.txt -- Same as above and warn if the checksums 
                            format is wrong in the file.

$ sha1sum --status -c input.txt -- Indicate the status in exit status 
                                   code.

Read: man sha1sum

"If formulaic Hindi films were protected by patent laws, we would be
able to make only one film," joked Abraham. The system of software
patenting wipes out smaller businesses and innovation, he said.
"Software, like poetry and literary works, is already protected by
copyright. After all, Bill Gates made his fortunes from copyright and
not patents. But many software companies are trying to get additional
protection."

Copyright and patents are both part of intellectual property rights,
but copyright restricts the expression of an idea while patents
restrict the idea itself, according to Abraham. Under a patenting
regime, even before a kid writes one line of code he has to read many
patents."

A laptop is more than a CPU, RAM, HDD, etc.

Ergonomics, battery life, heat/cooling, weight, build quality and
durability, keyboard feel, linux friendly hardware, etc. play an
important role.  Unfortunately, most of these are not found in the
specs or data sheets.

If you share this perspective, Thinkpads are the best match.
IBM/Leonovo website offers a limited range of Thinkpad models,
so speak to your local reseller to find all the models that are
available.

You are looking for a NAS server.

I have installed NFS at home and it works exceptionally well though the
traffic sometimes is excessive. (NFS v3 is what people use. NFS is very
well supported over all UNIXes and linux)

You have to go for a much noisier SMB protocol by running Samba on the
server in case you have Windoze clients.

The advantage that SMB has over NFS is auto discovery. Linux has
excellent SMB client capabilities as well.

You have to add a mount option in the /etc/fstab file of each of the
clients to mount the network file system at boot.

Of course you need the NFS client software installed on all linux client
boxen.

Subject: What you can do for "Lenny"
To: debian-devel-announce@lists.debian.org


Hi!

You probably noticed by now, that Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 aka "Lenny" hasn't
been released in September. Well, that's a shame, but very easy to
explain: Too many release critical bugs[1].

 1: http://bts.turmzimmer.net/graph-large.png

Well, our release team coordinated several transitions, took care of
release goals, but it's pretty hard to estimate, how fast RC bugs will be
fixed, and apparently they were a bit to optimistic :(

The big question is: What can you do, to help release "Lenny" at least in
this quarter? That's pretty easy: Fix rc-bugs, take care, that the fixed
packages are migrated to "Lenny", do upgrade tests, document problems in
the release-notes. Pretty simple, isn't it?


For users (or better: For everyone)
=========

Even as a "simple user" (aren't we all just users?) you may help getting
"Lenny" released. Some things you can do:


* If you are running stable (aka "Etch"), you could consider
 upgrading to "Lenny" and see, if everything works fine. Currently there
 are no detailed release notes documenting the procedure, so you best
 way to test upgrades are to:

 1. Make backups
 2. Change your /etc/apt/sources.list
 3. Run aptitude update to get information about new packages
 4. Run aptitude install dpkg aptitude apt to install the newest package
    management
 5. Run aptitude full-upgrade

 If something goes wrong / something unexpected happens, please report
 it. If you already know a specific package, report a bug against that
 package. If you don't know, please report a bug describing the problem
 you experienced to the upgrade-reports package. If your problem is
 something, which can't be fixed properly, but should be documented
 (e.g. hardware support regressions, packages no longer available)
 please report a bug against the release-notes package (Bonus points if
 you not only report the bug, but also supply a paragraph to be added to
 the release notes).

* Speaking of the release notes[2]: You can take a look at the bugs reported
 against the release notes and see if you can help there, e.g. by
 writing a paragraph describing a problem.

  2: http://bugs.debian.org/release-notes

* Install the package devscripts[3] (you'll need the version provided by
 backports.org[4], and run the script rc-alert --include-dists TU. You'll
 get a list of release critical bugs open for one of the packages you
 have installed. Guessing that you have them installed, because you are
 using them and are interested in them, you should have a very high
 interest to get this bugs fixed :)

  3: http://packages.debian.org/devscripts
  4: http://www.backports.org/

 You can try to help, by trying to reproduce them and reporting that to
 the bug report. There are even some easy bugs, where the maintainer
 hasn't found the time, yet to fix it. Bug 497290[5] for example didn't
 need deep technical skills. It just needed someone with some time to
 collect the needed data for the copyright file.

  5: http://bugs.debian.org/497290

* If you speak a language other than English, you might consider joining
 the translation efforts. While it is to late to translate the
 debian-installer or the installation guide to a new language for
 "Lenny" (perhaps for the next release then?), you could start
 translating the release notes to a not yet supported language. If you
 are willing to do so (which can be quite time consuming, especially in
 the final phase), please contact either your localization team[6] or the
 debian doc mailing list[7] if there's no local mailing list.

  6: http://lists.debian.org/i18n.html
  7: http://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/

See? Even as a "simple user" without deeper technical knowledge you can
help us getting "Lenny" in shape to be released. If you have technical
knowledge: Very good! You might want to read the next section, too, and
see what applies to you, there :)


For maintainers (Or: For everyone with some more experience)
===============

It basically boils down to two things: If your packages have RC bugs open
in "Lenny" fix them and take care, that the fix will propagate to
"Lenny". If your packages don't have RC bugs open, fix someone else's RC
bug. Surely you don't think, the release team will fix the remaining rc
bugs, do you? And surely you understand, that your shiny rc bug free
packages are kind of useless, if they aren't released?

To search for bugs to be fixed, take a look at the unofficial rc bugs
thingy[8]. The URL lists RC bugs open in both "Sid" and "Lenny". Obviously
they should be fixed ASAP. If no one takes care about these packages,
they might be removed from "Lenny" (if possible).

 8: http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php?bydist=both&sortby=packages&fullcomment=on

Again: Try to reproduce the bug, try fix it, upload an NMU (or send your
patch to the bug report and search for an sponsor). You'll notice, that
some of these bugs already have a patch. In that case, your job would be
to test the patch, report that to the bug report and offer to sponsor an
NMU.

Another interesting list is the list of rc bugs open only in "Lenny"[9].
These bugs have been fixed, but the fix hasn't propagated to "Lenny",
yet. Normally, the release team will grant freeze exceptions for these
packages if possible. However, if the changes to the fixed version are
quite grave or the package in "Sid" depends on a newer package than in
"Lenny" that's not possible. In these cases look out for packages marked
as "need tpu upload" or similar.

 9: http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php?bydist=lenny-only&sortby=packages&fullcomment=on


Oh, and if you could refrain from upload new upstream versions of
packages to "Sid", you would make all our lives easier. Some reasons:

* New packages won't reach "Lenny" anyway.
* Upload new packages to "Sid" makes it harder to get a fix into "Lenny"
 should a new bug be found.
* Uploading a new package makes it harder for other packages depending
 on your package to be migrated to "Lenny".
* You are wasting the buildd's time.

And of course you should spend your time fixing rc bugs anyway ;)

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

cksum -- Computes a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) checksum.

Summary:

`cksum' prints the CRC checksum for each file along with the number of
bytes in the file. The CRC algorithm is specified by the POSIX Std. It
is not compatible with the BSD or System V `sum' algorithms.

Example:

$ cksum file -- Prints the Checksum, No of Bytes and filename.

$ cksum file1 file2 -- Prints the Checksum, No of Bytes and filename 
                       for each file.

Read: man cksum

Hi Team,

I installed a fresh debian etch and doing following steps to setup user mode
linux :
(installed uml kernel package and uml utilities from debian etch DVD.)

1) dd if=/dev/zero of=root_fs bs=1M count=4096
2) mkfs.reiserfs -f root_fs
3) mkdir mounted_root_fs
4) mount root_fs mounted_root_fs -o loop
5) rsync -ax --exclude=root_fs / mounted_root_fs
6) vi mounted_root_fs/etc/HOSTNAME
   Changed the hostname.
7) vi mounted_root_fs/etc/fstab /* After my change line will be like below :
*/
   /dev/ubd/0   /   reiserfs   defaults   1   1
8) linux mem=128M

While starting uml(i.e. linux mem=128M) I am getting the error like :

Warning: unable to open initial console.

I am using GNOME and doing this from gnome-terminal.
Can anyone tell me what are the exact steps I need to do to initialize
console?

Thanks,
Bhavesh.

I suppose you remembered to umount the filesystem image after this.

Your command line does not contain the root file system image name or
rootfstype.

Did you specify the console type? Look at uml manpage for details.

Hello,

I did not read Bhavesh's mail carefully before my earlier reply.

Please read the file /usr/share/doc/user-mode-linux/README.Debian

> 8) linux mem=128M

The correct command line should be something like
 linux mem=128M ubd0=root_fs root=/dev/ubd0 rootfstype=reiserfs \
  con0=fd:0,fd:1 con=xterm ro single

The option "single" is just to check things out and can be dropped
once your system is working.

Note that "etch" uses "udev" so that your / directory may not have
enough devices. So in addition to rsync you may have to create
devices inside root_fs:/dev

Regards,

Kapil.

Message-ID: <3232b7ed0810070456x64bb389fv2a3823e3b765eb21@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All!

I was previously on this list from the mail ID AshokGautham@gmail.com. I had
a huge backlog of mails to be read. Also, I needed that ID for my resume and
stuff like that. So I just archived all my mail and jumped to this new ID.

I saw a poster at my college(Meenakshi Sundararajan Engg College) about
Hindustan Linux. I tried Baskar's page. But there was no direct link from
that page. Also, I looked up the archives through the subjects from the last
2 months. I couldnt find any relevant heading (pardon me if I overlooked
it). I have not been active for a long time on the list(read as never 20
mails in 2 years :P). But now, I plan to spend a lil time on this. Can
somebody point me where this student driven project is located. I would
seriously like to chip in a part.


Thanks a lot,

Ashok `ScriptDevil` Gautham

A wild guess. Have you tried creating the /dev/console special file
manually with the mknod(1) command?

Thank you,

        And here is a  typical command line I use to start off a UML I
 use for compiling packages:

my_uml_run is an alias for:
  rm -f cow_fs; TMPDIR=/scratch/sandbox/tmp screen -L -d -m -S \
  building_uml  /usr/bin/linux umid=build mem=256M con0=fd:0,fd:1 \
  ssl=pts con=pts devfs=nomount                                   \
  eth0=daemon,,unix,/var/run/uml-utilities/uml_switch.ctl         \
  hostfs=/scratch/sandbox/staging,append selinux=1 audit=1        \
  ubdb=swap ubda=cow_fs,root_fs

        It has several features: I use screen to background the actual
 linux task,  so I can run it out of cron, if I wished (and actually do,
 on some machines, to run a virtualized service on hardware that does
 not support kvm).

        It creates /dev/ptyXX consoles that can be connected to via
 screen, instead of popping up xterms.

        I have turned on networking in /etc/network/interfaces using
 tun/tap. I have created a swap file and mount it using ubdb, so the
 machine has some extra memory. 

        I also mount a file system from the host in an append only mode.

        HTH. HAND.

Hello,

I got the following from Neil Williams' blog.

 It's really quite strange to come across a tool that is
 incredibly useful, does exactly what I need but of which I was
 completely unaware. This time it is manpages.debian.net - how
 long has this been around and why hasn't it been announced
 somewhere? The best part is that if a manpage uses a See also
 section, the references to other manpages get turned into HTML
 links to the relevant manpage on the site. Getting a manpage
 is now as simple as:

  http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=%s

Note that Debian requires _all_ binaries to have manpages so
sometimes there will be manpages here which have not (yet) been
included in the upstream packages.

Kapil.

------- Translated and Forwarded as requested by Amachu ------------

Hello all,

In this December, Ubuntu Tamil Team will be introducing the Ubuntu 
Mentor Project. As a part of this project, members of the Ubuntu Tamil 
Team will travel wide across Tamil Nade and spread the awareness about 
GNU/Linux using Debian/Ubuntu. They will conducting a range of training 
programs to cater to different types of audiences.

In the beginning, two kinds of activities will be taken up,

1. Based on Debian/Ubuntu, 2 day training programs for Students and 
Teachers.
2. Based on Debian/Ubuntu, 1 day training programs for Employed and 
General Public.

As per the real-time requirements, the programs can be extended to more 
days or shortened up.  The training will be conducted using both English 
and Tamil languages. This is an initiative by Ubuntu Tamil Team with a 
personal interest and motive to become a self-sufficient and independent 
body to conduct such training programs in future.

If you are confident of your abilities to participate and enlighten 
people, with sufficient knowledge and experience in working with 
Debian/Ubuntu, we welcome you to join the family of Ubuntu Mentor Team. 
The minimum requirement to join us will be the ability to communicate in 
Tamil (as this will be important once we leave the urban grounds behind 
and enter into rural lands).

Future plans are to include training programs on programming, web 
development, etc. but if your would be able to handle these topics now 
we will be delighted to include them as well, perhaps in the training 
programs for students and teachers.

We also express our interest in coordinating with various GNU/Linux User 
Groups, Government Projects and Organizations, NGOs, Academic 
Institutions, Corporates and other Individuals to join us in this 
initiative and make it a grand success. Please help us to this cause by 
spread the word to other LUG mailing lists, related web groups, 
educational institutions, organizations which are interested in knowing 
about GNU/Linux and would like to have a training program on the same. 
For all details on conducting this program in the organization you 
belong to or to know more details about this program, please feel free 
to mail amachu@ubuntu.com (who have been CC'ed to this mail). We have 
started to plan and schedule the program and would be great if you could 
act fast.

Message-ID: <d5c9fe000810072127w3bcb6c7qd9092c2abc58e881@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a doubt in accessing python through Apache. I have the
following configuration in my apache2/site-default/default file.

 <Directory /var/www/python>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride None
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
                AddHandler mod_python .py
                PythonHandler first
                PythonDebug on
</Directory>

My /var/www/first.py file looks like this.

    def handler(req):
    req.content_type = "text/plain"
    req.write("Hello World!")
    return apache.OK

def get_time():

        html = """
                <html><head>
                <title>get_time function</title>
                </head>
                <body>
                        <h1>get_time function</h1>
                        <hr>
                                The local time of this server is:  %s <br>
                                The timezone of this server is  :  %s <br>
                </body>
        </html>""" % (time.ctime(time.time()), time.timezone/3600)


When I give the following url "http://localhost/first.py" the function
handler is getting executed. But when I give the url
"http://localhost/first.py/get_time" the function get_time is not
getting called. What should I do to call anyfunction in a python
script through mod_python?

I am using Debian Lenny for this.

regards,
siva.

Recently Microsoft won the case over patents for FAT
http://blog.taragana.com/index.php/archive/microsoft-fat-patents-declared-valid-trouble-for-linux/

Well. Now what? Should we start using some other file system on our pen
drives. If so, how do we communicate with Windows machines? Also is doing
something so immediate more paranoid than practical?

Contrary to "dwww" this service will have manpages for packages which
are not locally installed on your machine.

For example, while looking at the manpage for x (which is a binary in
X) it refers you to the manpage for y (which is in package Y). Now if
you have X installed but not Y, then you don't know whether
installing Y will really help you solve your problem.

With the online version you can actually see the manpage for y
without installing Y.

Hi Team,

Thanks for you suggestions.

Only thing was missing was /dev/console. I created it using mknod(used major
and minor similar to my working debian). Now I am able to login in my UML.

Thanks,
Bhavesh.

With all due respect to your idea I would like to point out one thing.

Man pages are meant to be read using the man(1) command for a reason.

You wish to know what architecture and 'variant' is installed in your
system and refer to the pertinent man page.

In fact in many cases the ultimate authority of what feature is
supported in your system is your installed man page.

That said this facility is useful.

Thanks.

Just out of curiosity, I remember an Indian who was doing something
very similar to this as his/her GSOC project. Just cannot pop up the
name of the project nor the person from my mind. If anyone has

It's Ria Das and she did it as a part of GSOC 2007

"""Ria Das, Jeff Sheltren, Publication of all man and info pages for 
each release through a web interface"""

I couldn't open the corresponding page in the Fedora Project website and 
hence not giving the link.

Oh.. I did not check the date... It was digged recently... under unix/linux
:-|

And yeah... I used to have ext2 on my drive... But how do I get it to work
on a new system with only windows and no net. Say during project
presentations.

I am planning to partition my pen drive(it has 4 gig) into 2 parts. One with
fat for 50-60mb. Where I have the tuxidow installer. And then the rest with
ext2 ... why would I need ext3 here anyway :P

Subject: [Ilugc] Reliance Huawei EC-121 USB CDMA modem conf problem
Message-ID: <5ff65e910810090023v41ee60fp426f63348fb2c87f@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I got a Reliance Netconnect USB CDMA modem.  They gave me a Huawei EC-121.
I am trying to get it work in my Ubuntu Hardy laprop, but no success yet.



---------------As soon as I plug in, this what dmesg shows :

<snip>

Actually, an iso9660 filesystem gets mounted - probably to autoinstall the
dialer in windows.

Then, I unmount whatever that was mounded like a CD-ROM.  And then, from
lsusb, I get the vendor id and product id and :

prasanna@prasanna-laptop:~$ sudo modprobe -v usbserial vendor=0x12d1
product=0x1411
[sudo] password for prasanna:

Most of the writeups on the net shows that dmesg itself will show
/dev/ttyUSB0 created.  But, I couldn't find any /dev/ttyUSB0.
So, looking at somewhere, I typed the following two lines...


prasanna@prasanna-laptop:~$ sudo mknod /dev/ttyUSB0 c 188 0
prasanna@prasanna-laptop:~$ sudo mknod /dev/ttyUSB1 c 188 1
prasanna@prasanna-laptop:~$ ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*

Please help me.

It is being detected as a pseudo SCSI CD-ROM device, hence no
/dev/ttyUSB* devices.

Not the same modem, but, still relevant:

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

lsb_release  -- Show Linux Standard Base and Distribution info.

Summary:

If the installation is LSB compliant, the "/etc/lsb-release"  file
should contain the LSB_VERSION field and other optional fields like
DISTRIB_ID, DISTRIB_RELEASE, DISTRIB_CODENAME, DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION.

lsb_release will read the above config file and show the details in 
different format. It is useful command to find your distribution 
informations.

Example:

$ lsb_release -- Show the LSB version number.

$ lsb_release -i -- Display the distributor ID or Name.

$ lsb_release -d -- Display the single line text description of the 
                    distribution.

$ lsb_release -r -- Display the release number of the distribution.

$ lsb_release -c -- Display the distribution code-name.

$ lsb_release -a -- Display all of the above information.

$ lsb_release -s -- Show only field values, not the filed name.

$ lsb_release -ds -- Show only field values, not the filed name.

$ lsb_release -as -- Show in short format.

Message-ID: <582fce4d0810090446l735a61acqc0d831e2798acf3b@mail.gmail.com>

I've written a bash script to get my SSID and accordingly set my network
preferences (on a Mac). The script works well in an interactive shell but
fails to work similarly when invoked thro cron.
ssid = `networksetup -getairportnetwork| cut -d : -f 2`
echo $ssid ESSID found.

gives me the SSID of my access point. Output is
MOHAN-DSL ESSID found.

script contents:
ssid = `networksetup -getairportnetwork| cut -d : -f 2`
echo $ssid ESSID found.

is invoked using */3 * * * * script > logfile in crontab. cat logfile shows
just
ESSID found.

Any pointers?

Ensure your PATH environment variable is set correctly.
cron by default use a minimal PATH.

cron(8) cannot use STDIO, STDOUT or STDERR. All point to /dev/null.

So it is AFAIK impossible to run interactive programs using cron.

First check whether your script works in a batch fashion rather than
interactive. Then you can get it working with cron.

Of course you need to give full path for 'networksetup'.

By default, cron saves anything written to stdout and stderr, and emails
it to the cronjob owner.

Dude, care more about the utility than worrying about these problems. The
pen drive storage area is formatted to FAT by most manufacturers. So its
something they should worry about and not you I guess :-)

Hi,

I do not have a net connection all the time, so I have configured local yum
repos. I even tried rsyncing one of the livna repositories. I have all the
packages listed in one of the Livna repos. However now that I am not
connected to net, I tried to install some packages and I still get
dependencies error.

Can someone guide me on the best way to install packages with no dependency
errors. Is there a site that provides the dependencies along with the
package src codes or rpm packages.

If you have a complete local repository, you can easily modify yum.conf 
to point to it. Refer

Hi Rahul,

I have already made this repo. However the issue is that still I get
dependencies errors. If you can guide me to some site, that provides all the
'lib' packages, that would be very helpful.

I also agree that stallman is wrong. According to him cloud computing
is only possible by third party companies like Google, Yahoo, Amazon.
It is because they are the ones who provide software services of huge
volume. They process more data every second than any other companies
on this planet. They need a cost effective approach to process large
amount of data with available hardware resource and I'm sure cloud
computing is the best option.

I don't understand why he is missing the point that cloud computing is
feasible more because of open source tools like Hadoop, MadReduce. The
important aspect of cloud computing is that it is cheap. If user is
worried about security, FREEDOM, or relying upon a third-party
software vendor for data processing, well, he can have his own setup.

That depends on the precise nature of the patent. Every time you
add/delete/rename a file you are using aspects of the FAT filesystem.

For example, according to some interpretations of the MP3 patent,
even decoding an MP3 using floating point processing requires a
license to use the patented technology. In that case, the software
that does this comes with your MP3 player and so it _is_ the
manufacturer's problem. But your pen-drive does not contain the
FAT filesystem software.

    ^^^^?

I did not say that I think RMS is wrong! In fact, I agree with him
quite a bit in this matter.

Of course, we are worried about Freedom. That is what the F in
FOSS/FLOSS/FSF stands for!

I have no objection to putting data that I would normally put on my own
web pages or a public server onto the cloud. After all:

 (a) The cloud may be more easily reachable for some users than my
 own web pages.

 (b) The master pages for the data are with me so I can make another
 copy if the cloud "vanishes".

Using the cloud to process data is also not such a big problem as long

Instead of using your own handler, i think you should use
mod_python.publisher as your handler. In addition, whatever you want
to print, you should return it from your method and the publisher
handler would do the rest to display in the browser. I've not used
publisher class, but I think it works this way.

If you rewrite your http configuration snippet and code as follows,
you should be able to access get_time() function using
http://localhost/first.py/get_time url:

HTTP CONFIGURATION SNIPPET
    <Directory "/var/www/python/">
       Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
       AllowOverride None
       Order allow,deny
       allow from all
       SetHandler mod_python
       PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
       PythonDebug on
    </Directory>


REWRITTEN first.py SCRIPT
import time

def get_time():

       html = """
               <html><head>
               <title>get_time function</title>
               </head>
               <body>
                       <h1>get_time function</h1>
                       <hr>
                               The local time of this server is:  %s
<br>
                               The timezone of this server is  :  %s
<br>
               </body>
       </html>""" % (time.ctime(time.time()), time.timezone/3600)
       return html

TIP: It is always a good practice to use a separate directory instead
of the apache root directory to execute server side script. In your
case, you can create an alias as follows and access the method using
http://localhost/python/first.py/get_time url:
    Alias /python/ "/var/www/python/"

Post your repository configuration files and the exact error you are 
getting if you want to specific help. If your local repository is 
complete there shouldn't be any issues.  There is a number of utilities

All complete mirrors carry the library packages.

Cherry picking just libs will likely not resolve all the dependencies 
however since packages may not just depend on libraries but on other 
applications as well.

Well, if you care only about efficiency of "cloud computing" and tools 
(they might be free or non-free) without considering the freedom aspect, 
you are unlikely to understand his view point either.

Whether Hadoop is free software or not is irrelevant if your only access 
to it is a server side instance which you cannot control at all. This 
problem is being tackled however.

Thats the issue. For all its efficiency and ease of use, if cloud
computing service provider is going to impose a lock-in to use only
its own service, its no different from the lock-in Microsoft is
usually associated with.

If Google docs does not allow data export to odf then its no better
than MS Office (on the freedom aspect.... on features aspect MS Office
still beats it). It doesn't matter whether open source software or
proprietary s/w is used in the backend.

Strangely, many among open source proponents think that as long as
open source s/w is used in the backend and as long as the cloud
computing service provider is contributing to some open source
projects its freedom friendly!!!

In fact, in a discussion in this list long ago it was generally
accepted that freedom is only an issue if s/w is being distributed
without source code. If there was no distribution involved and only
'use' as by a cloud computing service provider, there was no
problem!!!

Well, you have to look at it holistically - the industry becoming 
involved in large-scale use of foss is generally a good thing - they 
invest in the technologies either directly or indirectly. Thankfully, 
most forward-looking companies 'get' open source now - they realize that 
just ignoring it is not an option anymore.

Apart from the scare-mongering of RMS, I don't see anybody realistically 
putting their data in places where they cannot take it out. Perhaps 
regular consumers yes, but companies, no. It's just a matter of time 
before even that gets fixed. In the internet economy, you cannot afford 
to be evil - open source or not.

        I think you can use aliases. It is something like this:

#ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.1.1 up
#ifconfig eth0:2 192.168.1.2 up

Please, correct me if I am wrong.

I don't know much but AFAIK cookies are used to store HTTP session
information. Their length is limited to around 4096 bytes or so and are
usually used to store login information or specific userid/sessionid
info which can be used to track users.

In fact all session oriented HTTP activity (browsing) have to
necessarily use cookies.

HTTP is a stateless protocol and there is a reason for making it so viz.
performance.

Cookies add the ability to maintain state like 'logged in/logged out' or
it could be some hidden info.

The user's browser is used to store the cookie which is set by the
server. And on subsequent requests by the browser, the cookie is sent.

This is how HTTP cookies work.

You will need to make sure that the aliasing module is compiled into the
kernel. Because after certain release of kernel (not sure which) aliasing
does not get compiled by default. Atleast the kernel used in Fedora 9 and
Centos5 does not contain that by default. So please check on that.

Thanks a lot for the link.  But still there is some problem.

I copied the files from above and did necessary modifications(the vendor and
product ids) and put them in place.  So, now, when I boot with the USB modem
plugged in, the kernel modules get loaded.  But, I couldn't find
/dev/ttyUSBx.

These are the files I copied and modified from the above link :
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-huawei.rules and  /lib/udev/huawei-mobile.sh  (both
these files are attached)

When I insert the USB modem after booting also the same case :

prasanna@prasanna-laptop:~$ lsusb

Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
prasanna@prasanna-laptop:~$

And I did :

sudo udevcontrol reload_rules

and

sudo modprobe -v usbserial vendor=0x12d1 product=0x1411

But still, dmesg shows

Values that are required across multiple web pages are stored in a separate session for each
client machine. A sessionid stored in the cookie is like a label using which the client machine
can be matched with its appropriate session.

Is there any switch on the modem that allows you to choose the
configuration between mass-storage and modem functionality, before you
plug it in to the laptop?

I'd also suggest that you write to Huawei technical support with the
log messages, because, they have documentation for GNU/Linux for Hutch
in Thailand made available:

Yes, the packaging is appallingly stupid. However, all slides are
accessible if you browse the directories. e.g.

Lecture_2/Lecture_2_files/SCP16_files/SCP160707_2_files/Slide0003.htm

Message-ID: <e43212340810102245p20253ad8rd2fb6bb88b8329e9@mail.gmail.com>

Sir,
      All guidelines in net has same class IPs and single gateway.
When i configured it in Ubuntu with following addresses

First network:
Network IP: 192.168.42.33
Netmask : 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.42.100

Second network:
Network IP: 172.20.16.33
Net mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway : 172.20.16.1


First access network is alive and other one may alive after every network
restart.

How can i rectify it?

If we configured Intranet ( class B network) and broad band connection in
single NIC using alias, intranet will be accessed only if broad band modem
is switched off. otherwise system searches the network in internet using
DNS.

What will be the remedies?

Padhu,
Ooty.

Your question is not clear enough for someone to try answering.

Things look alright prima facie.

Do you have two separate network interfaces? How do you configure two
different networks?

IP aliasing is used for "advanced" networking and for people who know
what they are doing.

In most cases separate physical network interfaces (or even virtual ones
in case you run qemu or something similar) need to be configured the
above way .i.e, on different networks.

Thanks.

Me too feels the same. I believe I can suggest solution if I am clear about
the issue. Please reply with what is your requirement, what you have
configured, what you are expecting and what is actually happening.

hi,
    tell ur doubt clearly.
    IP,Subnet Mask,gateway is enough.
    Sometimes DNS is needed.
   If u have DNS IP , just you put this IP in to /etc/resolve.conf file.
   Otherwise, If ur internet connection has DHCP option,just connect ur data
cable in LAN port and restart your machine.

Proxy server?

What is that?

There are a dozen proxies. HTTP proxy, FTP proxy, TCP proxy
and so on. ;)

Anyway I was kidding.

What you are looking for is  a simple HTTP proxy for web browsing. You
either need squid[1] setup. It is not easy...

You have to configure all browsers to point to TCP port 3128 which is
squid's default port.

There are other proxying services too. And they use different ports.

There is also the simple SOCKS proxy which does only proxying, no
caching.

Unfortunately many of these need you to do some research.

Just taking a liveCD and setting up a proxy may not be a great idea.

In matters pertaining to networking/server room activity it is best to
rely on relevant knowledge...

Thanks.

Hathway provides me with static IP and now the same via DHCP, too. So,
it is as good as saying plug and play via Ethernet card.

Message-ID: <467c0a9a0810111210t36af7152h86c581b09b18d362@mail.gmail.com>

Hi chennaites,

I was wondering whether it is possible for us to get togehter to solve one
of Chennai's biggest emerging crisis - traffic. A big technology and
community opensource project. Ofcourse this will not be chennai specific.

Phase 1 : Get people follow rules (we need this for any traffic management
system! and unfortunately should be impossed) - Cost effective linux single
board computer connected to a webcam to capture red light violaters. The
hardware can be mounted on top of signal to capture images which can be
downloaded to police laptop through bluetooth/wifi/gprs.

Phase 2 : Connect cost effective sensors embedded in the road to the SBC
above wirelessly to count vehichle traffic. Provide this data offline to the
police laptop on daily basis and/or intelligently communicate the vehicle
concentration data to the next signal (via gprs) to effectively handle them.

Phase 3 : Central traffic management system controlling entire traffic in
Chennai with data being actively provided by hundreds of intelligent traffic
signals.

Probably lots of simulation from phase 1 data can lead to an incredibly
streamlined traffic... Yes I know we involve the police and the corporation
which most of us might not want to get involved with - but they might be
really interested and is good for all of us. Probably I am dreaming, but
went ahead and posted this (Dr.Kalam told us to dream right?!)

A collosal project which might bring students/academics/industry/lawers(to
keep clear of patent issues) together. Let it be open source.

Commercially, a local GSM/CDMA network provider might be really interested.
There can be a lot satellite projects (from the data produced)- SMS based
traffic guides / fastest route etc.

Funny note : Add an automatic VIP/VVIP/VVVIP priority system in - and we get
contracted to do the project immediately!

What do you guys say? Start a discussion group?

Arun Venkataswamy

You have to call up Sify Customer Care and tell them to let you login
through Linux. They will ask you for the kernel version and then within a
couple of hours or so you will be able to login using sifyconnect.

That is correct. I am a big/avid fan of BSNL and Indian govt. in
general. For instance I use SBI for banking.

BSNL gives superb broadband service. I use BSNL for landline
 telephoy (there is no better choice) and also for my mobile.

In fact their prepaid offers give you more talk time than you pay for.

But alas, most people are stupid and prefer some silly song to be played
back to your caller. Who cares? ;)

(BSNL supports this by the way)

Anyway the query was about broadband and linux. BSNL uses very high
quality hardware infrastructure and their Chinese Sterlite MODEMs are
extremely robust.

They give you DHCP server, NATing, port forwarding, even simple
firewalling. The model number is MT882.

Whereas I had an experience with Airtel in which their USB MODEM sucked
big time. The connection wasn't mine of course. It was for a friend.

Anyway people have some well deserved prejudice against BSNL. But wise
people look at facts and not prejudice.

BSNL service and customer support is not universally good -- the same
holds good for any other ISP as well.  See the user reviews on:
http://www.mouthshut.com/product-reviews/BSNL_Dataone_Broadband_Service-925048601.html

Every ISP has both good and bad reviews.  To measure the true quality
of a company's customer service, see how unhappy customers (who
are experiencing service, support, billing difficulties) are treated.

In my personal experience, BSNL has the *worst* customer service
department.  The people on the phone are not even polite -- when I
had a billing problem, customer support told me "to stop sending a
complaint letter because it was a waste of paper".  WTF?!

What are you implying?  People who don't use BSNL are stupid?
What facts, other than your own personal experience, can you quote
to show that BSNL is better?

Why didn't your friend ask for an Ethernet Modem?

Since nobody except Google has the source, you would have to ask them. 
They probably considered that information confidential.

The reason can be that you are using your Gmail ID more than your other IDs.
I have noticed that on one particular ID that I use very rarely and never
get mails from (in short, a wasted email id), I hardly get spams. The most
spam hit ID is my yahoo messenger ID followed by my gmail ID. I am happy
since not a single spam message has got past google's filter. I periodically
check to make sure that no legal mail goes to the spam box. That has occured
only once. That too was a forward from a friend that spoofed the nigeria 419
mail :P

 I would any day go in for an Airtel connection. I personally love their
unlimited at 256kbps plan. I was one of the few who upgraded in a window
where they actually gave their 128 kbps plan at 256kbps for the same rate.
(~Rs. 800 including modem and taxes). I think there might be a similar plan
open now. I never neeed a super fast 2 mbps connection with a gig or 2. My
monthly downloads range anywhere between 6 to 8 gb on the average and once,
evern 12 gb.. So BSNL is not for me.

Also, Airtel's service is good. They actually irritate you by being ahead of
time. :P

I have heard similar experiences. And now, I do not want to do this
(passing mails of other account through google account). Say one has
email account with POP, IMAP facilities and they are also affected by
spam.

How do one get rid of them. Say I use KMail, Evolution to fetch mails
from them. Are there effective filters/ methods available?

While we think s/w and business models are not patentable in India the
following report says about 36 s/w and business model patents have
been granted in India!

http://www.livemint.com/2008/10/07005343/Cozy-deals-and-conflict-of-int.html

Patents (the non software ones included) are causing a lot of pain and
stifling innovation by small players even in advanced economies -
where the rule of law is much better than here. In India where
anything and everything has a price and can be bought, this is going
to create real havoc!

+1 for Airtel. Close to 3 years for me too. I've heard good things about 
BSNL, but I probably cannot expect a BSNL engineer to visit me within 4 
hours of giving a complaint. Airtel does, and normally they appear 
within the hour. It's definitely a little more expensive than BSNL, but 
you can at least shout at the customer service and be taken seriously. 
Not that I had to.

I had an instance when the net connection went down at 4 am, and there 
was a technical guy at the other end helping me troubleshoot a DNS 
problem, from Linux. Afaik, their modems normally come with both 
ethernet and usb ports. You can use either.

    Though this is OT, I just wish to tell that I get the same for Rs.
750 in BSNL. You can get access @ 256kbps for Rs. 750/month. That
apart, The modem that they give is really excellent.

i thought fsck.in is specifically against people who package distro specific

things, go ahead and propose, but do not insult the foss community in India 
by discussing this here.

yes, it is a top post - without apologies.

Please go ahead and register. There is enough interest and people from
Ubuntu India are also interested in joining the work out.

I would love to attend if I have the money to pay for my travel to
India and back :)

Hi,
I am a serial entrepreneur and now moving to my third start up, The concept
is interesting and sounds promising. It is a mix of technology and business
process focused in the logistics domain. Am here because we are working with
a variety of open source tools and may also want to contribute our
development initiative to the community as no one has contributed in that
segment.

I do have a core team with immense experience in development and business
process are am looking for developers who can help me build this dream into
reality. I am open for discussion on terms and types of engagement.

Will give more details about my back ground, Past Achievements and core team
and of course the business plan if you find this an interesting opportunity.



Warm regards

But you have told nothing technical. ;)

This is a technical mailing list and simply working for a startup is not
going to motivate many folks.

People want to know if linux/UNIX is involved in one way or other.
People also want to know what specific skills you are looking for.

Is it web development? If so what skills? PHP, Java, Javascript?

Is it networking? If so are you looking for C or C++ skills?

Is it ERP/CRM/business intelligence? Then you can go elsewhere. ;)

Being vague is the biggest anathema of technocrats.

You should also show either technical command or at least speak about
technology in a manner that instills confidence in prospective
employees.

Thanks.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

factor -- Print prime factors

Summary:

Print the prime factors of each number. The algorithm, it uses, is not
very sophisticated. So, for some inputs `factor' runs for a long time.

Example:

$ factor 25 -- Print prime factors

$ factor 125 200 -- Print prime factors for each number.

$ factor `echo '2^64-1'|bc` -- Factors the largest 64-bit number.

$ factor `echo '4294967279 * 4294967291'|bc` -- Factors the largest
                 32-bit prime numbers. (Warning: It take more time)

Read: man factor

  hi ,
I download *.tar.gz of every package for my fedora9 box.
I do use "yum" for most of the package. But, those who are not
available in yum , i need to download them manually.But, there is
a problem in compiling error in *.tar.gz.

suppose .. package pidgin.tar.gz

I do extract by command tar -zxvf pidgin.tar.gz in a directory.
then ./configure ( If there is a configure file)
then make
then make install

In this commands the package should compile properly.

But, there is error most of the packages..

example :
make[2]: Leaving directory `/root/Download/libmpeg2-0.5.1/vc++'

more example :

make[2]: Leaving directory `/root/Download/libmpeg2-0.5.1/src'
make[1]: Leaving directory `/root/Download/libmpeg2-0.5.1/src'
Making install in test
make[1]: Entering directory `/root/Download/libmpeg2-0.5.1/test'

make[1]: Leaving directory `/root/Download/libmpeg2-0.5.1'

[ here i.. tried to instal libmpeg2 manually]

I 'm expecting solutions and help from other members.

Centos 5.2 has the "dhcpv6" package that includes the client and servers.
Those not wanting to run the server can install the "dhcpv6-client" package.

Hmmm.. What is the "error" here?? It seems normal!
In case a file has already been compiled, make will not recompile it. Also..
It need not compile certain files. That I suppose is the meaning of "nothing
to be done for" etc..

A small tip: do not make files as root.. The general way is to make as a
normal user and use the root user only to make install

You can create a local bin folder like /home/<username>/bin and then do a
./configure --prefix=/home/<username>/bin. Here both make and make install
can be done as a normal user.

Of course you need the following line in your .bashrc
PATH=${PATH}:/home/<username>/bin

in order to get the run it directly

Message-ID: <912C32424B1CEE4AAFC8DAB823406787011BDA3650C9@LTVSMBX.lucastvs.co.in>

Hi,

I configured Wine in Ubuntu for using outlook 2007.  Except outlook rest of the application are working.

When I click outlook it promts " Outlook cannot start the item".

Please let me know whether Outlook 2007 will work on Wine, since our mail server is Exchange 2007.

I tried the procedure from the  url  http://ph.ubuntuforums.com/showthread.php?t=844309

Is there any other way or software which connects with exchange 2007 to get Global address book, mail and calendar.

Regards,
Karthick.V

Does marking it OT make it any more tolerable to post such 'offers' on 
this list? Pardon me, but the whole thing sounds exploitative, and I 
call it spam.

Ummm? A bit off thread, but just to reply your comment: IMHO, Java/J2EE 
indeed has a place for discussion in a LUG mailing list as you can also 
do Java programming and app development in Linux. Indeed a lot of famous 
FOSS projects use Java. AFAIK, Ubuntu has a separate Java Team to handle 
Java related packages in Ubuntu. Do not confuse a programming language 
with an OS (which is a platform for anything from your desktop to watch 
movies and listen to songs, to a development environment, to a server, 
to whatnot). It is as permissible in this mailing list to discuss 
Java/J2EE/JBOSS/JSP development on a GNU/Linux platform as much as 
Python, Perl or PHP is permitted.

Apart from other concerns that others have raised here, the subject
was misleading. It is NOT a job offer. It is a solicitation for a paid
training program!

If springboard takes so much care to screen candidates so that only
those capable of clearing the exit test will get through why not take
money AFTER placing the candidates! You can even take the usual one
months salary from the employer and also from the candidate as there
was training involved!

Dear All,

I wrote this to the list to convey the message to people who could get
benefitout of it & not advertise. This is urgent opening for an MNC in
chennai. We are basicly Corporate training company located in chennai this
recuritment for one of the Client due to confidentiality i am unable to
reveal the name but i could like disclose  with you in offline.

this forum should not be misused for commercial exploitation of innocent

Here you made a point regarding the Blood sucking & Commerical exploitation
in the list. Its not an eye wash and i want to make one point very clear.
What do you think if i Say India's third largest IT company charges 22k from
the people for their fresher induction program. Company  had signed a bond
with the people stating the money is refuned only on the sucessfull
compeltion of the  program. If not the candiate may lose both their
opportunity to get into the compnay as well as the the fee what he paid for
the program. I know all these because we trainined those freshers.

Now the current IT  compan's they  want to cut down the money what they
spend for the training & especially  on the freshers, these people have the
tie with the compnay like us they want the candidate need to be get trained
on the self supportive basis.

Sir,
      One of my friend who is recently switchover to linux. He wish to use
mail client very closer to outlook. he also wants to move his mail archives
created by outlook. I suggested him to use evolution mail client. After a
week he conformed that his archives moved to linux using and start using
evolution without any difficulties.
Now he is using FC8.

      Hence try to use evolution mail client and avoid outlook simply.

Padhu,
Ooty.

True ....but you do not have to apologize. Talking of geographical location,
I am not even from India. I am interested in this group because of open
source , Linux and my interest in IT industry in India and Tamilnadu.

Anyway mission accomplished ! He got lot of attention anyway !

Is there a ILUG-C AUP's posted somewhere ? in the absence of such, the 
list is pretty much fair game to anyone and anything. A brief look 
around and I was unable to locate anything that might indicate the OP 
was that far off.

I am in a senior position in a IT firm. The posting was definitely nothing related to this list. If this posting is valid, I don't see anything preventing other training firms across India posting similar offers on this list. We will have to create another list called 'ilugc-tech@ae.iitm.ac.in'

While I welcome people trying to recruit FOSS experts on this list, I take strong objection to a 'deposit' linked scheme.
I wouldn't have a problem if the hiring co. directly posted here and even then only if there is no mention of  'deposits'. I don't think it is justified for an intermediary to post that message which is *closely* related to deposits and incidentally related to FOSS.

I understand the logic of the person posting that message on this list. I would consider the posting not to be in the spirit of this list even if its technically 'OT+COMMERCIAL+FOSS'. I think the author is new and misunderstood the purpose of this list. I wish success to the author in his business but also to respect the time of the many subscribers of  ilugc.

I am from Hyderabad. I find ilugc much more active and useful than ilughyd. Please keep it that way. 

I personally know of a lot of firms in Hyd which offer jobs by taking
'non-refundable deposits'. A lot of them work in php related technologies. 
Some even give fake experience letters in FOSS technologies in return for money. If
this post is valid, we will have a deluge of mails from all these fake  cos. just because they fulfill the 3 criteria [OT][COMMERCIAL] and related to FOSS.


I think the mailing list moderator should take a stronger view and ask the user not to post such messages in the future.

The point was, if someone was to write up an AUP, its something posters 
could refer to in order to work out whats acceptable and whats not. If 
there isnt anything of that nature, then I think its not write to whack 
peopl[tm] on the head when they come around with crazy posts that are 
clearly not welcome here.

Yes !

It would have been a different matter , if a member had posted a link to
this offer. That way he is only sharing an information/opportunity he came
across.

But the company posting directly soliciting such "deposit based training"
should not be welcome here.

yes i work for that company, Then you mean to say that i  not allowed  to
post  that in the mailing list. So that i could make  Tom, Dick and Harry to
post  the same thread than it would be totally applicable to  everyone. Is
it so , this is what you are trying to say....

I like to confess  my public apologies to every one, i deeply regret for the
in convenience which i was a  caused for.  Dear members, I am not a
marketing Person, or not even good enough in marketing. What all i did is?
thing what ever i received form my people i conveyed to the list. Since my
objective is not to promote a business or to sell a product. I thought of
conveying a message to the appropriate person, but everything end up in the
mesh. If you say, what i did was  not ethical way am sorry for that.

I could write cock & bull story to justify myself, but i never want that to
happened. I have got serious of  work lined up would everyone please allow
me to do my job. I was treated very nicely thanks, thanks a lot.

I am in a senior position in a IT firm.

Nice to hear, What your company do for the fresher induction program? for
many people (fresher) an offer is given without confirming the joining date.
How many times in a year you call your business partners (people who supply
man power to you for "Ready made {developers, trainees} to put them in to
the project whenever your client pressurise you.

The posting was definitely nothing related to this list.

+1, while i write my inital thread request people to ignore the message if
it is not appicable to them

If this posting is valid, I don't see anything preventing other training
> firms across India posting similar offers on this list.

I gotta great response for my thread, that is the reason why other companies
had no choosed this channel. they dont want their effort to go vein.


> We will have to create another list called 'ilugc-tech@ae.iitm.ac.in'

Good idea

"'deposit' linked scheme" sexy title, good!.  What  is the necessity for the
'deposit' linked scheme?
Company A, wants 25 candidates who has to be passed out his BE/MCA in 2008
{note: they are not ready to offer for expr candidate - cost cutter} who
need to be productive with in a month to manage a mission critical
application for one the international bank.
I have series of point to arise

1. Why not company A  recruit people  through the campus, because if they
have recruit then they need to promise certain things.  if that doesnt
happen the institute would black list the compnay.

2. Today companies is not much interested  to spend huge number for the
fresher inductions and other training programs as a matter of cost cutting
technique.

3. Why people need a induction program? whatever  they cant learn in 4 years
of their college we trying fill the gap between what they have? & what the
industry need is? Why cant engg. colleges work on these produce and a
quality engineer who is ready for the production straight way, with or
without any transistions.

4.  Company needs only fresher,  Fresh man from the college we know what is
his standard is. In this case if company is not willing to pay for their
trainings but they need candidates in time to convince their clients with
head count. Who will pay for their training. What about an idea making free
of cost.
charity work great idea, i love to help them but on one condition let me
know how many of you are ready to work with me provided no one should take
their salary to their home.


> I wouldn't have a problem if the hiring co. directly posted here and even

I hope you might have link with the people who are in the leading Indian
MNC's Please ask to them what is  the policy they have for their fresher
induction program. Since i have proof with me, very recently i handle
induction training program for 200 candidates

Last not the least, One final point i need make very strongly, I couldnt
understand why do u mean by fake. I hope everybody is paying IT returns, how
of us trying to find the a lope hole to minimize the it.  What you call it
as, you call it as honesty,   lol  :) , please  stop referring as  fake
company. My organization is very open any Tom, Dick & Harry can check our
accounts, our  creditability  and get a reference from our Corporate
clients. Please guys stop assuming that only your company is
"harichandran".  Everybody  know what every one is with,

if you want to enforce rules in this list - it is a good idea to *follow*

Hi,

We do know that most common distros that originates abroad do not
include the necessary plugins for playing mp3 by default due to patent
issues..

how about the condition as on date in India for distro that is created
and circulated within India?

Another take:

"Are we so deranged here in the twenty-first century that we're going
to re-enact, wide-eyed, the twin tragedies of the great desktop-suite

Subject: [Ilugc] Karalikal Orphanage LTSP Lab Setup,
 Call for Volunteers For Educating Teachers
Message-ID: <48F6C9EC.60505@efrontier.com>

Many of you who attended the ILUGC meet On saturday have background on
this.
For rest here is a brief info,

I am working with a valley based  NGO called Home of Hope to setup a
computer lab
for the orphange set up in the  tsunami affected coastal town of Karaikal.

For more information on home of hope, and their projects, following are
the links

Home of Hope: http://www.hohinc.org
Karaikal Project: http://www.hohinc.org/projects/kariakal.html /
http://hohlab.org/
HOH Featured on NBC : * *http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6T8YmxPOcE
Moving Pictures: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKk4WPV6s0M

We are using Edubuntu + LTSP setup with one server and 8/16 client
machines.
The setup is almost ready, customized in tamil,  and most of the
machines have already been shipped to karaikal.
I am personally visiting the orphanage this weekend  to finish the
setup. I could probably be
able to  make arrangements  for a couple more people if there is enough 
interest.

Now, as we discussed in the meet, we need a few volunteers to educate
the teachers there
on using edubuntu and the packages that come with it. Eventhough, most
of the software are self explanatory,
I feel there is still a need to atleast educate them on which ones are
used for what purposes.
We could design a syllabus as well if we have enough human resources.

I would appreciate, if you could reply back with your interest to
volunteer and we could take it further from there.


Thanks
gourav

Hi !

Sorry guys ! I did not realize it till  you pointed out !

........ Gmail abstracts away posting styles
when you're reading mail, by collapsing quotes inside mails and
displaying preceding mails above the one you're reading. This is
great, but what's not so great is that replying in Gmail caters to top
posting, with no option to have the caret inserted after the quote.
Though you barely notice the difference as a Gmail user, it's a
courtesy to people with other mail clients.......

Looks like I have to move the cursor to the bottom and type the reply
every time !
I will be more careful in future !

Cheers

Varadarajan.

I had a talk with folks back at my organization, and we do have a few
interesting  projects that we want to work on, but don't have enough
time  due to our other engagements. I have put togather a list of those
projects as well as few personal hobby projects, that we would love to
see taken up by students and getting it done. The students will get to
learn on few of the  interesting and practical technologies. We might be
able to have them intern at Efficient Frontier(www.efrontier.com)
subject to our availibilty to mentor them.

This list is in order of priority that we want to get done,

*1. Build a complete conferencing system:*
Build a solution to provide a complete voice and video conferencing 
system based on free/open source software.  Build dedicated appliance
based on Asterisk/Freeswitch/Skype to provide a VoIP solution to
interconnect multiple offices of a organization spread across the world .

Topics Touched : Operating Systems, Telecom, Networking,
Scripting/Programming, VoIP

*2. Design and deploy Server Automation and  Virtualization Solution *
Compare various virtualization technologies such as openVZ, kvm, xen,
virtualbox;  identify the most suitable for server virtualization and
provide a solution to setup, automate, manage  server virtualization.

Topics Touched: Operating System Internals, Networking, Virtualization
Techniques


*3. Framework for  Online Testing*
My organization uses a barebone online testing framework as part of the
recruitment process which is built on Google Apps, Python etc. This has
helped us to carry out hiring in a much efficient manner than earlier
times.  We need someone one to take this framework  and build a very 
intelligent and complete  solution with enhancements such as computer
adaptive tests, streamlined UI etc.

Topics Touched: Python, Google App Engine/ BigTables(google's Db),
Algorithms


*4. Build a Custom Distribution based on OpenSuse:* This is the
requirement for my organization. We have standerdized on opensuse and
build our own distro on top of opensuse. We want to manage our own
distro more effectively and innovatively and also customize, trim,
optimize  host opensuse os according to our needs for both desktops and
servers.

Topics Touched: Operating Systems, Kernel Compilation, Optimization, 
Package Maintainance etc.


In addition to these, here are a few  personal hobby projects,


*1. PVR/Home Entertainment/HTPC Appliance*:  Design and develope a
commercially viable  appliance based on linux/embedded linux to work as
a PVR(Personal Video Recorder) and home media/entertainment server.  It
could work as a one stop solution to all home entertainment needs. Do
additional things such as customizing  mythtv to make it manage with set
top boxes available in India, add channel guides, manage
bigflix/seventymm queues etc.

Topics Touched : Operating Systems, Networks, Scripting/Programming,
Embedded Systems, Multimedia Systems

*2. Enhance mobile appl smb4s60 * -  smb4s60 is a mobile smb client
written in python . Currently works in Nokia s60 phone and enables
browsing network shares over the  wireless network.  Written by Premnath
Sah (prem_sah@efrontier.com).
Homepage: http://www.lnkr.net/smb4s60

One can take this as a base and add more functionalities, add support
for wide number of cell phones and handheld devices etc.

Topics Covered:
Python, Nokia S60 platform, SMB/CIFS, Authentication, Networking.

*3. LTSP Benchmarking:*  There are no solid benchmarks available on
which to base  decisions as to what  hardware to use to deploy a LTSP
setup, how to scale it up etc.  This project will involve setting up
LTSP with different hardware and testing it  running  various sets of
applications,  monitoring server and collecting performance data, put
the  stats in a database,   and come up with benchmarks. 

Topics  Touched : Operating Systems, Networking, Performance Testing,
Scripting/Programming, Database


We could spec out the projects if students would like to take it up.

this is a bottom post - which is just as bad as a top post. You must trim off 
all unwanted matter like I have done here. So you see a neat short post that 
all fits into one screen and is completely self-explanatory. Correct 
interleaved posting is a science that comes with practice.

Software patents have to be registered on a regional basis unless there 
are international treaties between countries automatically enforcing 
them between places. Software patents in general don't seem to be valid 
in India and even if they are, there is nothing which automatically 
validates the U.S ones, here.

With these assumptions, I have released Omega, a remix of Fedora -

https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2008-September/msg00015.html

It does support mp3 out of the box (among other codecs). Note however, 
that once you start distributing a variant, there is nothing controlling 
redistribution of it outside of India especially if it is out there in 
the Internet. So the question really would be, would you be held 
responsible? I wouldn't think so.

ah! didnt look there, I only looked at the mailman page. Perhaps a url 
directly to the guidelines could be added there as well.

Also, I've never had a copy of those. Are you implying that a copy 
should be sent to the list every month ? Dont think I've seen one, ever.

Finally, nothing there about how people might handle Job, Commercial, 
semi-OT subjects. Also, there is no guideline that says what sort of 
content is welcome and whats not. Emphasis seems to be only on howto 
post and what sort of formating to use etc. Nothing about content at all.

Responsible to what? This is the law of our land, so you don't have anything
to tell them even if they come talking to you personally.

Held responsible for others infringing on software patents that might be 
valid in their region. Internet makes the transition from local to 
international laws, fuzzy.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

tar -- Create/Add/Extract Tape ARchives files.

Summary:

tar is an archiving program designed to store and extract files from
an archive file known as a tar file.  A tar file may be made on a tape
drive, however, it is also common to write a tar file to a normal file.

Normally ".tar" file is not a compressed files, it is actually a
collection of files within a single file. ".tar.gz"/ ".tgz" is a
collection of files in compressed mode.

Example:

$ tar -cf myfile.tar mydir -- Create new tar file.

$ tar -cvf myfile.tar mydir -- With detail output.

$ tar -tvf myfile.tar -- List the content of the tar file.

$ tar -uvf myfile.tar mydir -- Update/Append files that are newer 
                               than copy in tar.

$ tar -xvf myfile.tar -- Extract the tar file.

$ tar -xvf myfile.tar dir1/file1 -- Extract only file1 from the tar.

$ tar --delete -vf myfile.tar *.doc -- Delete all files with .doc extn
                                       from tar file.

$ tar --diff -vf myfile.tar mydir -- Differences between archive & mydir

$ tar -czvf myfile.tgz mydir -- Tar and GZip the files.

$ tar -xzvf myfile.tgz -- Extract the tgz file.

$ tar -cZvf myfile.tgz mydir -- Tar and compress the files.

$ tar -xZvf myfile.tgz -- Extract the tgz file.

Read: man tar

Thank you Mr Bharathi for your help to provide all the information about the
commands.... But its ambigious to use certain commands such as enscript,
pdf2ps , man2html even after reading their  man pages. So I would request
you to give examples on those commands...


Thanks

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

tar -- Create/Add/Extract Tape ARchives files.

Summary:

tar is an archiving program designed to store and extract files from
an archive file known as a tar file.  A tar file may be made on a tape
drive, however, it is also common to write a tar file to a normal file.

Normally ".tar" file is not a compressed files, it is actually a
collection of files within a single file. ".tar.gz"/ ".tgz"
is a
collection of files in compressed mode.

Example:

$ tar -cf myfile.tar mydir -- Create new tar file.

$ tar -cvf myfile.tar mydir -- With detail output.

$ tar -tvf myfile.tar -- List the content of the tar file.

$ tar -uvf myfile.tar mydir -- Update/Append files that are newer 
                               than copy in tar.

$ tar -xvf myfile.tar -- Extract the tar file.

$ tar -xvf myfile.tar dir1/file1 -- Extract only file1 from the tar.

$ tar --delete -vf myfile.tar *.doc -- Delete all files with .doc extn
                                       from tar file.

$ tar --diff -vf myfile.tar mydir -- Differences between archive & mydir

$ tar -czvf myfile.tgz mydir -- Tar and GZip the files.

$ tar -xzvf myfile.tgz -- Extract the tgz file.

$ tar -cZvf myfile.tgz mydir -- Tar and compress the files.

$ tar -xZvf myfile.tgz -- Extract the tgz file.

Read: man tar

Sadly, we focus so much on correct usage of a foreign language, English,

Many people around here cannot write the spelling of my name properly.

They spell it as "Grish".

I wonder how they can miss the 'i'.

In fact some of my friends don't even have the desire to learn English.

Whether or not it is a foreign language is secondary. It is the lingua
franca of the world for better or worse.

If we are to do anything significant in the business world English is
inevitable.

I have at the same time met quite a lot of technically competent people
and hard working individuals who don't have language skills to match.

While I do agree that command on English is important in the 'globalised'
world, but should we make it butt of jokes? Should the lack of better
language skill be an obstacle in learning a technology? What is more
important -- bridging the digital divide or language skills? Adrianne
Knopper, Klaus' wife and inspiration behind Adrianne Knoppix, doesn't speak
English at all. I have met many non-English speaking experts and they
refrain from speaking the language. The point I want to drive home is, this
is a GNU/Linux mailing list, not a writer's block ;-) So, I just found it
not so good to discourage someone, by pointing grammatical or spelling
errors. We are not linguistics ... we are linexers :-)

To be precise, it is essential to have functional English [1]
(reading, and comprehension skills), which is the reason why one finds
plenty of FOSS development in Europe, inspite of they being non-native
speakers of English (except Britain).

Bad grammar can be ignored, but, atleast do a spell-check!

Unfortunately, in India, people give more emphasis on accent and
pronunciation (spoken English), rather than reading comprehension
skills.

Not sure if that's what the OP is looking for...

You'll have to parse the output of ifconfig(8) and get what you need.

Yes, mode of communication should be good as much as possible. But even in

I trust most of the friends are aware of this. There has been a lot of
doubts over using Ubuntu on servers. But recently Wikimedia and Internet
Achieve have started to migrate to Ubuntu servers. I guess this will build
confidence in those who want to use Ubuntu on servers.

If you can wait, on 30th Canonical will be releasing the latest version 8.10. By the way the DVD is no good, Live CD will do the job. You can download the latest version, 8.04, from the Ubuntu website (http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download).

Also once you install all the needed software. You may take back-up of var/cache/apt/archive. This way if your choose to reformat your machine, you will not have to download everything again.

A few practical examples:

Debian includes a mp3 decoder in main. For a non-profit  (even though it 
is established in US), there isn't much of a risk. The most you can do 
is filing a suit and if you win, stop the distribution of it from that 
point onwards. Usually can't claim much damages if any.

Mandriva (organization based on France where software patents are 
invalid) includes mp3 codecs. However recently, you have the alternative 
to get paid codecs from Fluendo via them. This is because they need to 
license the patents to do this to be able to target the US market in a 
legal way.

Ubuntu (Canonical is a based on Isle of man, Europe). They do not 
include mp3 codecs out of the box but point to (non-patent licensed 
free) codecs with a warning that this is legally ambiguous. You have the 
option of buying paid codecs from Canonical similar to Mandriva. 
LinuxMint, a volunteer derivative distribution of Ubuntu includes all 
the codecs out of the box and has become more popular these days for 
that reason. Canonical as a commercial organization won't take this risk.

Fedora (Red Hat is based in US) does not include nor point to the free 
codecs. Neither does OpenSUSE for similar reasons.

There a few questions that determine the potential course of action:

* Are you a commercial organization or a non-profit or volunteer 
community? If you are doing it without commercial backing, there is 
pretty much no risk since patent holders won't consider it worth their 
time or money to pursue you.

* Are you based on a region where software patents are valid like US or 
not valid like France or India?

* Are you trying to distribute directly only outside of areas where 
software patents are valid or are you trying to sell to US markets? If 
you are targeting only specific regions like India where software 
patents are invalid, again there is no direct risk to you.

In summary,

Internet makes pretty much anything you distribute a potentially global 
product but as long as you don't indulge in commercial trade to areas 
where software patents are enforced actively and infringe on them, the 
legal risk, if low to none. The laws are misguided in various places. 
There is no right solution to that problem except fighting to get rid of 
software patents and make sure, India doesn't end up in the same bad 
situation.

While not directly related to this conversation, thought I'd point out 
that things have got a bit sticky in France as well recently.

I trust Wiki migrated from Red Hat to Ubuntu and CentOS's updates are a bit
delayed (please correct me). Its high time to give Ubuntu a try, I guess.

and what exactly is the justification for a crosspost here? Cross post should 
only be used for an anouncement of general interest, like release of a new 
version of software or an event, or job advertisement. The above is none of 
these things.

Hi,

I would like to have clarity on what the real difference is between
different Linux Distros. What exactly makes one better than the other.

Do the distros have differences at the kernel level itself.
Is it only the applications packages that are included that make the
difference.
How does one distro be more secure and/or robust than the other. Is it that
the codes used for applications (iptables, apache etc etc) is different.
Are distros like Debian more secure only because they have fewer/no GUI
apps.

I hope I could explain what I am looking for. Would request your advise on
this.

Ashish

Messages such as the above are typically called "trolls". In other
words these are meant to start a heated discussion which ultimately
amounts to little.

A better way to frame your question would be something like.

 I am trying to do X. Which is a suitable way to do X? Is there
 a specialised distro to do X? Will other *nix be more suitable
 to do X instead of Linux?

Here X could be something like:
 Create a secure web server
 Learn about server security
 ...

Of course, since this is iLugc where L is for Linux, it is likely
that the answer to the last question will be "No!" except from
Girish! :-)

Kapil.

whether you mark it as cross post or not is irrelevant  - crosspost should

1) Most of the distributions have a targeted audience and try to make
the distro usable to that target audience without much changes to
default install.

For example many are general purpose distributions that cater to
normal desktop/laptop and server like Debian, Fedora ...

Some are for a particular audience like dynabolic for multimedia.

2) Another one is installation, configuration and maintainability

Debian and many of the distributions use apt based tools, Fedora and
many others use yum, gentoo has emerge and others have different
methods.

3) Stability depends on how much testing is done before a package is
included. Some have very strict rules before they include a package,
some does not have any.

For example Debian needs the package to be in unstable section for a
specified  time (depending on priority), then remain in testing and
have all its important bugs fixed before it can go to stable release.

> Do the distros have differences at the kernel level itself.

The version of the kernel differs. Some have older kernel, but well
tested. Some have bleeding edge kernel with latest drivers.

> Is it only the applications packages that are included that make the
> difference.

The number of applications ready to install also does matter. Debian
lenny fits in 34 CDs/5 DVDs with official support.

> How does one distro be more secure and/or robust than the other. Is it that

The policies for inclusion and time taken for testing.

> the codes used for applications (iptables, apache etc etc) is different.

Some of the options selected by default differ.

> Are distros like Debian more secure only because they have fewer/no GUI
> apps.

Depends on the strict policy and adherence to it. Also the time and
number of people testing it.

Hi Kapil,

I asked that not with intention to start any heated discussion or argument.
I did not even mean to say anything is better than the other. It was for
purpose of my knowledge. Since these things generally come up when a grp of
guys are discussing, it arises such questions. I only request for inputs
rather than raising conflicts. Any distro/os may be better than each other.
However since Linux and Unix are the one's with similar structure, I had
this doubt.

In every case. ;)

The argument goes like this.

Windoze supports a lot of applications and is apparently very user
friendly. Or rather idiot friendly to be precise.

Linux comes second.

UNIX does not support as many apps as linux but is more robust and
certainly better.

So it goes without saying that if you want the greatest app that is the
talk of the town, then it will take a while to get that for UNIX.

For instance firefox browser under OpenBSD still does not support flash.
There are few websites that have videos or flash animations that won't
work under OpenBSD.

The main reason people do not understand the superiority of UNIX over
linux is that they do not know how to read kernel C code...

Thanks.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

zip -- Package and Compress files in Zip format.

Summary:

zip is a compression and file packaging utility. The zip program puts
one or more compressed files into a single zip archive, along with
information about the files.

Example:

$ zip stuff * -- Create stuff.zip, add current Dir files in it.

$ zip -r myzip mydir -- Create myzip.zip, add mydir files in it.

$ zip -j myzip mydir/* -- Same as above. But mydir name will not be 
                      recorded.

$ zip -rm myzip mydir -- Delete the original files after zipping.

$ zip -r myzip mdir -x \*~ -- Exclude all files that end in ~.

$ zip -u stuff *  -- If myzip.zip is already exist then, update new 
                     and modified files from the current Dir.

$ zip -R foo '*.c' -- Travel the Dirs recursively starting at the
                     current directory and zip all C files.

$ zip -n .Z:.zip:.tiff:.gif:.snd myzip * -- Create myzip.zip file, add 
    files from current Dir and Don't try compress the specified files.

$ zip -rt 2005-06-06 myzip mydir -- Zip all the files in foo and its
              subdirs that were last modified on or AFTER 06-06-2005.

$ zip -rtt 2005-06-06 myzip mydir -- Zip all the files in foo and its
              subdirs that were last modified BEFORE 06-06-2005.

Read: man zip  (Lot of examples are available)

HTH :)

Subject: [Ilugc] jQuery documentation
Message-ID: <20081017045539.GA14551@gayatri.gayatri-hitech.com>

jQuery, a masterful piece of human genius in web design was covered in a
small way in my Dec ilugc talk at IITM.

But I feel quite bad that I could not do proper justice to it.

You can read this documentation and bookmark it for the future.

http://jquery.bassistance.de/api-browser-1.2/

Javascript is an exceptionally powerful language that forces you to learn a
lot of new idioms in programming.

It also necessitates you to think in new says and is a paradigm shift
from the traditional C programming model in which everything follows
from top to bottom.

Anyway now coming back to jQuery(http://www.jquery.com), jQuery makes js
programming real fun. 

It has all the economy of expression that has traditionally been C's
stronghold and also the power and flexibility of the web environment.

The web as a medium and browser as the killer app of the future cannot
be overemphasized. 

And jQuery forms a very important link in the chain should you be
concerned with user interface in any way.

More contributions from my side will follow later.

I also take this opportunity to announce a one day web programming
workshop.

This will be at a later point in time maybe December.

Thanks.

Dear Ashish,
              Linux kernel as well as many other Open source software like
Apache, OpenSSH, KDE etc. are maintained centrally by their respective
maintainers. People do contribute code to all of them and it gets
incorporated. Distro creators do not entirely change the code. They may just
introduce minor patches, backport features from a future release etc. Like
OpenSuse backported some features of KDE 4.1 though they released OpenSUSE
11 with KDE 4.0.3 (As 4.1 wasn't out then). Regarding the kernel, distros
may use different configurations at compile time; to generate a kernel say
that's more optimized for Servers. As for your comments about GUI apps
making a system more or less secure; it's unfounded. Well coded GUI apps are
as secure as their non-GUI counterparts. Infact in many Linux "GUI" apps,
all they do is execute ur normal program at the back. The GUI is just sugar
coating.

Karthik Ramgopal

I am visiting KLES's College of Engg., & Technology, Belgaum next week to
give a talk on FOSS and discuss about their FOSS activities. They are keen
on FOSS training workshops (for students and staff), projects, etc.

Would like to put them in touch with LUG / FOSS community members who could
help them. Bangalore LUG group might be ideal. Cotacts from others are also
welcome.

[They might be closer to Kolhapur where Kenneth had initiated lots of
activities. But, for administrative purposes, they fall under Karnataka
universities. We could also use them to initiate introduction of FOSS in
curriculum in these universities, reach out to more colleges, etc.]

Would welcome contact info and other suggestions.
thanks and best wishes
Srinivasan, NRCFOSS.

If possible, would suggest to get rid of this google trap at the
outset. A mailman under some domain would be great.. Most features of
a google group is made avilable only for those with google account...

The ILUG-Bangalore is as of now an enthusiasts and discussion group and 
we are pretty new to get involved in such things. It would be a better 
idea to involve FSUG Bangalore in this as they have more physical 
presence and have been quite involved with academic community in 
Bangalore. I will cross post this into FSUG list.

thanks for the help. some of the FSUG members might be from Belgaum area (or
have some interest).

from my personal experience -- at FOSS as well as ealier "community
activities" --  it helps to identify one or two persons and use them as
initial contact points. [Kenneth often teases me that I interact only with
Raman & Bharathi!]. Their initial task might be to nurture the local
community in the college, bring out a couple of persons who could (become
FSUG members and) then take over the coordination, interacting with FSUG and
other groups.

I personally find that fsugs are too idealogicaly narrow to work with. I 
prefer to work with lugs.

Message-ID: <e3dcb5360810170109t3148ee79qbe867b6a6a705228@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am changing the thread from ILUG - Bangalore... Say I want to join a
public mailing list, lets have ILUG and ILUG Bangalore..

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/listinfo/ilugc I visit this and
simply give my email address and later at some point of time check my
inbox to confirm..

But what does the public URL of ILUG Bangalore lead to?

Go to http://groups.google.com/group/ilug-bengaluru/ and Join this
group, it asks me sign in with google account.. Yes non-gmail account
holders can sign but only by sending e-mails...

Second thing, I have noticed is when I think of changing the mail
delivery options..

Every mail id subscribed to a mailman based list is by itself a
account, a subscriber can log in and change his mail delivery
options.. But with google groups? So far my experience about the
option available with a googlegroup is to send mail to the moderator
only.. there can be work-arounds.. are there other ways?

there are several other small  inconveniences that I have faced.. this
may equally apply to yahoogroups etc., also

where there is no way, well googlegroups/ yahoogroups or whatever may
be afforedable can give solution.. but?

I read kernel code, but not yet an expert. For me the real difference 
lies in the architecture which is very different. Linux supports more 
features than Unix. Linux has been the start for many advanced features 
which others where reluctant to include in their kernel. For more 
in-depth kernel related questions you should seek kernel-newbies mailing 
list.

Hi Everyone,

Barcamp Chennai, the second coming, is happening this weekend in IIT Madras in IC&SR Auditorium. Do apologize for the late notice, but if there are folks who'd like to participate, share, and conduct a session or two on things they have learned, discovered (or invented tsk tsk) they are more than welcome to. I guess the official mantra of the Barcamp has become that No one is barred from sharing.

If you are interested, do visit www.barcampchennai.org, for more details and for entering your name.

Hope to see some of you passionate folks there.

Vijay Anand

Message-ID: <f69443a00810170514p7e32aear4c5b5d32a0a8e8be@mail.gmail.com>

sir,

 Right now . I am working on Mysql Master replication .
 when i start the mysql using /etc/init.d/mysql start

 error log is not update

 when start the mysql by mysqld_safe --log-error=/var/log/mysqld.log

 error log is  updated

 Note: in /etc/my.cnf

[mysqld]
datadir=/var/lib/mysql
socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
old_passwords=1

server-id=2

[mysql.server]
user=mysql

[mysqld_safe]
err-log=/var/log/mysqld.log
pid-file=/var/lib/mysql/server-1.pid

And one clarification more,
while starting mysql using  *mysqld_safe *
it show follows

 nohup: ignoring input and redirecting stderr to stdout
Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql

explain the error, nohup: ignoring input and redirecting stderr to stdout ?

why i am asking the above error bec my slave is not connecting to master. i
think this may could be problem


please guide me !!

What is UNIX? SCO's UNIXWare?  :P

UNIX is not a single OS is it? SCO might certify even Vista as a UNIX.
Just pay them some green ;) and bend some rules to get the UNIX 2008
specification.

Anyway, GNU/Linux IMHO is as good if not better than any "UNIX". Plan9
is a different story. But like the tux2 filesystem, plan9 is never
going to be out there. And yeah.. If Yahoo! uses FreeBSD, Google and
Wikipedia use GNU/Linux.

Who got the first IPv6 for example? Linux did.
Where do most enthusiastic students spend time coding? Linux again...
So... Which is the OS with the best chances of getting the next best
change? Linux...

Actually, where did you hear about these 'doubts' about Ubuntu on 
servers? Though their initial focus was on the desktop, they've been 
putting out excellent server releases since 7.x. It seems Ubuntu has 
effortlessly inherited Debian's strength on the server space. It's 
almost always the default OS we put on our servers these days.

Hey,
    There are still a couple of stragglers in the gnome-vfs to
GIO/GVFS [1] shift. Notably:

* A few rhythmbox plugins
* Minor tracts of Dasher [2] code
* Buzztard [3]
* Anjuta [4]

There are also parts of XULRunner, Inkscape. and WebkitGtk that
require porting. For those not aware of the shift, gnome-vfs, gio/GVFS
are api's to deal with file io and virtual filesystems (that's using
mounted partitions, streams, etc. as well as a wrapper over POSIX
functions). Gnome-vfs was deprecated because it was a sucky api, and
it had it's long overdue overhaul in GIO/GVFS.

To cut the story short, I wanted to register a GIO porting
"Workout"[5] (port-day) at foss.in/2008[6]. Anyone interested in

Yes. The volunteers, speakers come up with ideas and book a session on
the day. They also discuss about lightning topics for few minutes,
kind of eye-openers. Mostly they are related to, but not limited to
Web 2.0 technologies specially revolving around wiki, blog, podcast
and also various open source tools.

Message-ID: <f3d38c890810180732y3dfd3798t411672022abbae8e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ! Lugies !

I did a research on connection brokers for virtual machines. I could
not find any open source project.
All the commercial ones available for VDI like Vmware, Leostream etc
are closed and expensive ( licence fees normally around $80-120 per
user). Many based exclusively on windows platform. We have powerful
tools like virtual server LVS , load balancers , Linux routers etc in
Linux.
Companies with good products have been swallowed by big players like
Sun , Vmware , Redhat etc.

Any one came across a open source " connection broker for VDI" project ?

Cheers

Varadarajan

Thanks for that Shakthi. I am following the l4 mailing list too. I am
trying to find time to get my eyes on that code. I have promised
myself to do this during these sem hols.

Anyway, I think this is going way OT. And yeah, just in case you like
microkernels, drop me a mail. I would like to have a chat about
getting one running on my sys.

I believe , LUGies will not  interpret this negatively.
For supertux2, the following directory holds the status of each level
(whether completed or not)

$HOME/ .supertux2/save

The files inside this directory resembles play zone as follows

bonus1_1.stsg  bonus1_3.stsg  bonus2_2.stsg  bonus2_5.stsg 
bonus1_2.stsg  bonus2_1.stsg  bonus2_3.stsg  world1_1.stsg  world1_5.stsg

The status of a particular level (completed / not completed) is
represented in the following form
(solved #f) - Level not completed

(solved #t) - Level completed

So if you want to unlock all the levels of a particular zone, then the
following command will do the trick

sed s/solved\ #f/solved\ #t/g -i world1_1.stsg

It all depends on what pieces of software they are using and how well 
they have fine tuned their Ubuntu installations.  In the end it boils 
down to your personal experience with Linux server setups (be it Ubuntu 
or any other Linux distro)

Personally, I have to come across glitches in Ubuntu server versions 
e.g. libraries working in 32 bit version but not in 64 bit version.  
  
For general purpose out of box server installs, I prefer Debian, CentOS 
(RHEL compatibility), openSUSE (Novell/SuSE compatiblity).

Well, we can't cover every case that people might abuse it for, can we? 
We write down what we can, and hope that people respect the spirit of 
the list. [OT] and [Commercial] are fine with me, but somehow the mail 
seemed a little disrespectful to the kind of people we have on the list. 
I don't want to start a whole new flame war again, just mentioning why I 
objected. I'm sure you understand.

Nice to know that NRCFOSS is building the college community in Karnataka.
What would be really good is if NRCFOSS can share some advance info with the
FOSS community in Karnataka regarding the where and the when.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

unzip -- List, Test & Extract compressed files in a ZIP format.

Summary:

unzip will list, test, or extract files from a ZIP archive. The
default behavior (with-out any options) is to extract into the 
current directory (and subdirectories below it)  all files from 
the specified ZIP archive.

Example:

$ unzip myfile.zip -- Unzip the myfile.zip

$ unzip -t myfile.zip -- Test correctness of the file.

$ unzip myfile \*.txt -- Unzip only *.txt files

$ unzip myfile \*.txt \*.sxi \*.tex -- Unzip only *.txt, *.sxi 
                                       and *.tex files

$ unzip myfile -d /tmp -- Unzip the files in /tmp Dir. 

$ unzip -f myfile -- Unzip files which are newer then current 
                     Dir files.

$ unzip -o myfile -- Unzip and overwrite existing files without 
                     prompting.

Read: man unzip  (Lot of examples are available)

HTH :)

If you are going to claim anything like this, why don't you post the 
blog for reference instead of sending people in a fishing expedition? 
How can GPLv3 licensed software be "bogus"?  You are likely talking 
about an older version under a different license.

If it is GPL v3, then it _is_ GPL v3 isn't it?

Anyway, the previous was under a different license as far as I can
see. This is not!

Message-ID: <93655eb70810200939jbd2c1d6w7c534a6cb4354af@mail.gmail.com>

I was removing the old kernel files ( the image , initrd , modules ..
) after i upgraded to the latest kernel , and as i saw it is a manual
process where u have to delete a few files and then update the
bootloader ( mostly grub ) , ... so i wrote this simple script which
provided the kernel version removes all the concerned files from the
system , ... I have tested this only on Fedora and i am not sure on
how well this can work on other distributions ( as there can be minor
differences in how the kernel image is named or how the initrd image
is named ) :

#!/bin/bash

echo "Script for rempoing a particular kernel version from the system"
echo "NOTE: If the version being deleted is the latest kernel"
echo "on use in the system then you will have to automatically "
echo "update the soft links to /boot/vmlinuz and /boot/System.map"
echo " USE AT YOUR OWN RISK "
echo "send suggestions to <eerpini@gmail.com>"
echo "Press any key to continue !! "
read

echo " "
echo " "
echo "Enter the kernel version to be removed : "

read version

if [ "$version" != "" ]; then

#echo "The given kernel version is installed "
	echo "Cleaning up the files "
	echo " "
	echo "/boot/vmlinuz-$version"
	if [ -e /boot/vmlinuz-$verison ]; then
		echo "cleaning up vmlinuz "
		rm /boot/vmlinuz-$version
	else
		echo "The kernel image was not found for the given version try again"
		exit
	fi
	if [ -e /boot/initrd-$version.img ]; then	
		echo "cleaning up initrd "
		rm /boot/initrd-$version.img
	else
		echo "the file /boot/initrd-$version.img was not found ..ignoring !"
	fi
	if [ -e /boot/System.map-$version ]; then

		echo "cleaning up System.map"
		rm /boot/System.map-$version
	else
		echo "The file /boot/System.map-$version was not found .. ignoring !"
	fi
	if [ -d /lib/modules/$version ]; then
		echo "Deleting the module , do you really want to do this ?"
		echo "Press any key to continue .... :"

		echo " cleaning up the modules "
		rm -r /lib/modules/$version/
	else
		echo "The modules directory seems to be missing ... "
		echo "Could not find /lib/modules/$version ...ignoring !"
	fi
	echo "Updating grub ...  running grubby.. removing options for

	grubby --remove-kernel=/boot/vmlinuz-$version

	clock
	echo "Done ;-)"
else
	echo "You have not entered anything , try again ! "
	exit
fi

.. please let me know if this script works fine and whether it will be
or is useful (??) .... and also can it be improved , .. are we here
looking at something which is not fulfilled by any existing tool ??
the actual script can be downloaded from here :
http://satish.playdrupal.com/files/kernel_clean_up, and my explanation
here : http://satish.playdrupal.com/?q=node/68( I have given the same
explanation , so not very important ;-)).

Any specific reason this script should be used instead of "yum remove"
of the obsolete kernel package?  AFAIK, rpm will automatically remove
all the associated files, grub entry, etc.

It gets better. Not only does yum do this, it does this 
semi-automatically. Yum has a configuration option called 
installonly_limit where the default is set to 2 in Fedora.

That means, whenever a third new kernel is installed via yum, the oldest 
one is automatically purged leaving the current running kernel and a 
older revision alone. This value is of course, configurable. A script to 
do this manually breaks package management badly and should never be done.

Software in Linux distributions is managed by packages, be it RPM, Deb 
or something else.  Conceptually it's all the same thing and makes no 
material difference usually. The strength of using such package 
management is that every single file is available in a database for you 
to do very powerful queries. I know which package every single file in 
my system belongs to. I can figure out associated documentation, 
configuration files, update the software, remove it and so on.

If you install software from source or delete files arbitrarily, the 
packager manager is suddenly disconnected from this operation and you 
lose the benefits and get a mismash of files in your system which cannot 
be managed easily. Just say No.

If you compiled from source, there is no clean way to uninstall it. It 
won't disturb the package manager. The package manager just wouldn't be 
aware of it. It you are building a custom kernel, I recommend creating a 
package to do it. Refer

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Building_a_custom_kernel

In many cases though, building a custom kernel is unnecessary for end 
users. A module might do the job as well.

Guys let me clarify that i wrote this only for kernels which are
custom compiled ,... i do agree that package management does all this
very neatly and that is the best way to go , ..... but i am talking
about compiling vanilla kernels from source and later on clearing them
, .... and to my knowledge the script deletes only those files which
are added when one compiles a kernel and installs ,......
well even my suggestion would be that use make rpm or something and
then install the rpm .....
but my question was different ,... it is not whether it will do
something like yum and rpm does ( impossible ) , ... will this script
be handy ?


Thanks
Satish

Will this fit for only kernel or even
for packages if it is so in what means will it affect if i build an package from
its source and use it?

Thank you

For developers this is a good option. I used to build two or three 
kernel images per day while experimenting with the kernel, in such cases 
a script clean would be useful. It is not possible to create packages 
every time you want to build and test a new image.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

bzip2 -- A Block-sorting file (de)compressor.

Summary:

bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text
compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
considerably better than the conventional compressors, and approaches
the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

Example:

$ bzip2 myfile -- Compress & Save it in myfile.bz2. Delete the input 
                  file.

$ bzip2 -k myfile -- Same as above. But Don't delete the input file.

$ bzip2 -d myfile.bz2 -- Decompress & Save it in myfile. Delete the 
                         input file.

$ bzip2 -kd myfile.bz2 -- Same as above. But don't delete the input 
                          file.

$ bzip2 -fd myfile.bz2 -- Force overwrite of output files (by default,
                          do not overwrite the existing files).

$ bzip2 -t myfile.bz2 -- Check the integrity of the compressed file.

$ bzip2 -v myfile -- Show the detail status info about the operation.

$ bzip2 -q myfile -- Suppress non-essential warning messages.

$ tar -cjvf myfile.tar.bz2 mydir -- BZip2 thru TAR command.

$ tar -xjvf myfile.tar.bz2 -- BUnZip2 thru TAR command.

Read: man bzip2

        I have, on occasion, build 20-25 kernels for testing in a day --
 and it was even more important to build a .deb of the kernel image,
 just for the sake of cleanly invoking grub and mkinitramfs and removing
 all the files at the end of the test.

Mandriva has never charged for updates afaik. They have redistributed 
specific non-free software but I suspect you are not referring to that.

are you giving a prize for the mailing list that gives the best answer to your

I use ffmpeg and mencoder.

Never tried the other alternatives.

If you want to add audio, ffmpeg works well but you need to resample to
the right frequency.

$ ffmpeg -i video.gif -i audio.mp3 combined.mpg

Thanks.

Why do you want to do this?

> redhat..................

Anyway, here is one to do it.  Change the default shell for "root" user 
to /bin/false in file /etc/passwd.  NB: to restore it back to /bin/bash 
you will have to reboot the system in single user mode and restore the 
login shell back to /bin/bash.

details


*Modem = <the modem port recognised on running the command: wvdialconf
create , on the terminal>
Baud = 230400

ISDN = 0
Modem Type = Analog Modem

You might want to look into some of the things that SciLinux are into 
<http://www.scientificlinux.org/> - there is a moderately large

Its solved!

The point where things got stuck were I needed to disable the Wired Network
and then restart the network and I was able to connect through my n70.
However the only issue remains whenever I disable Wired Network, it erases
the entries and I have to re-enter them and also have to restart network
every time : root@mark-desktop:~# /etc/init.d/networking restart

Is it a needed step?

However, I am thankful to all those who took time to guide and help me out
on this problem. Thanks Srinivasan, Amit), Manglesh Arindhan, Arun,Podhu and
Meendar. Thanks buddies, I needed this urgently. And I got the solution
urgently :-)

Swapnil
PS: Thanks Kenneth Ji for keeping me on track and saving me from further
violating any mannerism of the list. Hope this email is not doing so.

What is the solution that worked for you?  There were several posts but 
which specific one  (or combinations) worked for you?  Pls. post your 
specific solution to all the lists where you cross posted this query.

In GNOME, in networking you can define networking profiles by name.  In 
each of the profiles you can select which network devices to be 
included.  When you are connected to wired network choose that profile 
and activate it and when you are connected via phone/modem you activate 
that particular profile.

It seems, Vista don't want to connect with Ubuntu. Here is what happend,

My collegue have Dell Inspiron preinstalled with Vista, Before he bought
his laptop, he used my system. So he wanted to transfer his files from
my system to his system. This is how we went.

1. Bought a crossover-cable and connected two laptops.
2. Both systems started dhcp request, Ubuntu settled with creating one
more ethernet interface 'eth0:avahi'.
3. Vista created a connection called 'unidentified network'.
4. I manually configured eth0 using the below command in ubuntu,

$ sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2
$ sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.2

5. In vista I went to ipv4 properties and manually added 192.168.1.4 as
ip address as well as gateway.

6. At last I tried to ping each other, Vista is able to ping
192.168.1.2. But Ubuntu was not able to ping, even 'destination host
unreachable' message not appeared. But `arp -a` showed his machine's MAC
address correctly(I'm not able to recreate the situation, my friend is
in bangalore now, Sorry for not pasting the output).

Help me to handle this situation.

Thanks,
Mohan R

Hi !

Just curious to know why you cant you do it simply over the LAN with Samba ?
I thought that may be an elegant way to do it ?

Hi !

Is not laplink like a regular network so long they have their  Ip address ?

Can anyone say if we can browse the windows machine with samba when
connected by a laplink ?

You should have checked to see what addresses were assigned to the
individual machines at this point. There is a link local IPv4 network
which is setup automatically by avahi; it is possible that vista does
something similar.

It is possible that vista disables ICMP packets or something. You
should have tried to use a TCP/IP service like ssh. Perhaps the vista
machine had some firewall rules setup.

Problems and solutions that cannot be re-created can generally be
treated as non-existent! :-)

Several possiblities
1) a windows firewall block. I dont know how to configure a filter for this.
The easiest way is to turn off windows firewall and try. (turn on before you
connect to internet)
2) Windows is configured to drop incoming ICMP requests. You have to find
out where this setting is, and turn off this "feature".
3) Windows is misbehaving. You may have to contact windows experts for this
case :(

One of the least painful ways to transfer files between computers is
to run a light weight webserver like webfs (no messing with samba)
and use a vanilla web browser to download them.

On Linux, webfs is a small web server that requires no config files
and can be entirely command line driven.

On Windows, I use the hfs web server, www.rejetto.com/hfs/.  No
install necessary, just run hfs.exe.  Open port 8080 or other on
your Windows firewall and any non-administrator user can then
use hfs to transfer files.

=============================

rpm -- RedHat Package Manager

Summary:

RPM is a RedHat Package Manager, which can be used to build, install,
query, verify, update, and erase individual software packages.

A package consists of an archive of files and meta-data used to
install and erase the archive files. The meta-data includes helper
scripts, file attributes, and descriptive information about the
package.

Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to encapsulate
software to be installed, and source packages, containing the source
code and recipe necessary to produce binary packages.

Examples:

$ rpm -qa -- List all installed RPMs.

$ rpm -qf /usr/bin/gcc -- Show which package installed this file.

$ rpm -qi -filesbypkg gcc-3.2.2-5 -- Show the information and list of 
                                     files from this package

$ rpm -qR gcc-3.2.2-5 -- Show the dependency of this package.

$ rpm -q gcc --qf "%-30{NAME} %10{SIZE} %{DISTRIBUTION}\n" -- Show 
                   selected info tags of the package installed gcc.

$ rpm --querytags -- Show all supported TAGs.

$ rpm -ivh new.rpm -- Install the new RPM. (v - Verbose, h- Show 
                      Progress bar).

$ rpm -U latest.rpm -- Update an Installed RPM.

$ rpm -F latest.rpm -- Freshen (Update only if installed).

$ rpm -e Package-Name -- Remove a package.

Read: man rpm

The network is available. Just go ahead and do the file transfer as
you intended to do it. Lack of response from vista for your pings is
irrelevant. Most likely its vista's default setting to ignore ping
requests.

I also transfered files using a similar method to yours.

Here is what I did,

1. Booted that Vista machine with my puppypendrive,
2. `sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2` and `sudo route add default gw
192.168.1.2` in Ubuntu.
3. `ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.4` and `route add default gw 192.168.1.4` in
Puppy.
4. `ping 192.168.1.4` in Ubuntu and `ping 192.168.1.2` in Puppy. Thats
it, we got the connection.
5. Puppy have ftp server, so no problem. I started the ftp server in
Puppy and `ftp 192.168.1.4` in Ubuntu.

Transfered nearly 12 GB of data from my system to his system(Movies,
Music though).

I posted this problem to learn how to peer-to-peer linux and windows.
but the above method is peer-to-peer linux and linux.

Thanks,
Mohan R.

Default gw is needed if and only if packets are going to traverse to/from your "local" network.  In your case it is not applicable.

Like others have commented; you need to turn off VISTA's firewall and security settings.

You did *not* tell us how you plan to copy the files from your Ubuntu machine to the Vista machine once you got past your networking issues.

Assuming you are running sshd in your Ubuntu desktop, I have found winscp to be the most painless solution to copy/sync. files between Linux and Windows desktop (for networked systems).  Search for wincsp and install the latest version on the Vista desktop.  It is open source and free.  As others have suggested, if the data set fits on a USB pendrive then that is another solution.

HTH,

Please tell what have you tried so far to make the printer work and what 
kind of problem(s) are you facing?

Without any clue from you it is not possible to figure out what your 
problem is.

From what I have seen on the 'Net, the 2240 is supported by Linux; the 
drivers should be installed along with CUPS.

If you are seeking step-by-step instructions on how to setup a printer 
then the please visit Ubuntu forums and search for printer setup.

Give a shot by configuring it with Samsung ML-2250 , may be it is the
same family of printers. Some times it may work.. a vague guess
anyway..

Hi,

A report from Linux Foundation...

http://desktoplinux.com/news/NS5325969099.html

"Have you got some loose change in your pocket, and dreams of building a 
better operating system? It would take about 25 years, nearly 60,000 
developer-years, and $10.8B to re-create a distribution like Fedora 9, 
according to a new report from the Linux Foundation. "

"The Foundation chose Fedora 9, even though it is smaller than some 
other Linux distributions, because Fedora uses open source software 
exclusively, with the aim of creating a completely redistributable 
operating system. Thus, using Fedora 9 is a good way to limit the scope 
of the study to "open source only" software."

It seems like I have some loose change in my pocket, but I am afraid it's not $10.8B :)

Do they transfer when you use some other application?
If not, then the problem is at the end of the site you are transferring to.
I assume you are uploading here...

The above is a silly argument as the Hurd is only one component and

Large parts of Fedora are due to GNU.

Telnet to which port? port 23? Is telnet server running in that case?
Also, what's the exact error?

Have you googled before posting the query?

The problem must be, telnet is disabled by configuration.

open  /etc/xinetd.d/telnet and check for the line.
disable = no

If it is configured as "yes", change it to "no". Restart telnet service and
check.

Problem with your firewall and nat rules. Firewalls need an ftp helper
vm run in order to handle ftp statefully.

Try switching your ftp client between active and passive ftp modes and
see if that helps.

It seems your NIC is Realtek-8168 and not regular Realtek-8169.  RHEL-5 doesn't seems to support 8168 ID.

To check whether your NIC is supported by RHEL-5, attach the output of the following commands to help you further.

1.  lspci -n
2. modinfo r8169

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

dos2unix -- DOS/MAC to UNIX text file format converter.

Summary:

Each OS will indicate the End of Line (EoL) with a Line Feed (LF,10)  
and/or Carriage Return (CR,13). So after transferring a file from DOS
to Linux, we have to convert the EoL from DOS format to Linux format.
EoL in Unix is LF, in Windoz/DOS is CR/LF and in MacOS is CR.

dos2unix will convert the DOS/MAC Text file to Unix ASCII format.

Examples:

$ dos2unix dos.txt -- Convert and replace dos.txt.

$ dos2unix -n dos.txt gnu.txt -- Convert dos.txt and write into
                                 gnu.txt

$ dos2unix -k dos.txt -- Convert and replace dos.txt while keeping 
                         original date stamp.

$ dos2unix -c mac mac.txt -- Convert and replace mac.txt from Mac to 
                             ASCII format.

Read: man dos2unix

Hi,

It may be ,but i am not sure ,the error tells you the  two
packages(libkdcraw-0.1.3-2.fc9.x86_64, libkipi-0.1.5-4.fc9.x86_64)
are already installed in your system .Now you are trying to install
another version. I think it may solve your problem.

remove the two package using yum

#yum remove libkdcraw

#yum remove  libkipi

 Then try to install compiz .

If it will fix your error .you just conform .

Thanks &Rg

hi Mohan,

that was actually a solution the issue, however I am not sure if it was
trying to install the same package. The error indicated that a file to be
installed by 1 package was conflicting with a file provided by another
package.

thanks

Regards,
Ashish

Sir,
      1. check telnet rpm package is installed or not. Because in RHEL 5,
telnet is not installed by default.
      2. ssh service is more secure than telnet.
      3. If you are trying to connect your server from Windows machine, you
can use free tools ' putty' or 'WinSCP'

Ubuntu have an synaptic package manager for on-line installation in GUI mode
and it is an painfree. You may download 'gftp' package from internet from
ubuntu repositories website and install it separately. Sometimes additional
packages required to install your required package.

this is becoming OT, but 'scientific method' is a myth - ayurveda doesnt 
follow the 'scientific method' as understood by westerners, but it certainly 
cures a heck of lot of diseases.

Just because a method called "Western"/"Indian" it does not become
valid or invalid.

The basic premise of the scientific method is that everyone/anyone
can be skeptical about the results obtained and has the freedom to
make their own choices. Authority figures need not apply.

Even if Einstein believed in god or other superstitions, I have the
choice not to.

In that respect it is very similar to the philosophy of mukta
software.

Even if Linus Torvalds or Richard Stallman starts using Windows or
MacOS, I have the choice to continue to use mukta software.[1]

The so-called validation methods for proprietary software are
bristling with "expert opinions" and "anecdotal experiences" ---
they cannot be based on skepticism since people are not allowed to
play with the source.

Whether you like it or not astrology is very similar to proprietary
software in its dependence on similar validation techniques.

So if you want to follow astrology, I will say to you what I say to
most Windows users --- if it works for you then go ahead and use it.
All the same, IMNSHO Windows cannot claim to be Shared
Source or something-almost-like-open-source. Similarly, astrology
cannot claim to be science.[2]

Kapil.

[1] In fact Linus made such a choice when he used bitkeeper and
numerous mukta software enthusiasts _did_not_ follow him!

[2] Since Windows claims that GPL is a bad software model why do they
want to be close to FLOSS? Since "Western" scientific validation
methods are "wrong" according to astrologers why does astrology want
to be called science?

I am not really defending astrology, but what is closed source about it? Afaik 
all the texts are out in the open. And there are more schools of thought 
there than there are linux distros!

My only point is that all these buzzwords like 'scientific method', 'agile 
programming', web2.0 etc etc are myths, and no two people can agree on a 
definition and no one follows these methods anyway.

Yeah agreed, we are unique. But I will not accept vaasthu or astrology as
scientific. A scientific technique is one that "will work" or have a reason
for not working in a particular situation.

I agree! A healthy dose of skepticism/disbelief is a good way to counteract
the buzzword compliance disease. :-)

along with the official ones can cause conflicts.

in which case there are very few scientific techniques in the world - classic 
example is the field allopathic medicine. Most of us follow fuzzy logic - 
there is a good probability that this will work, so lets try it again. Next 
one is - dont fix what is not broken - it seems to work, though we cant 
understand why, so leave it to work.

What we have to oppose is things like: everyone does it, so it must be right. 
That is unscientific, and I think that is the only principle one should use - 
just because everyone does it, why should I?

Message-ID: <4901F3D7.1000002@gmail.com>

Hi,

Since I came home today and turned up my modem alive, I have been facing 
frequent disconnections. Am not sure whether this has anything to do 
with the rain and hence bad connection or something wrong with my modem 
which is kinda screwed up. I have setup pppoe to connect my BSNL 
Broadband connection and I can see the following in the plog,

Oct 24 21:32:53 garuda pppd[14873]: No response to 4 echo-requests
Oct 24 21:32:53 garuda pppd[14873]: Serial link appears to be disconnected.
Oct 24 21:32:53 garuda pppd[14873]: Connect time 3.0 minutes.
Oct 24 21:32:53 garuda pppd[14873]: Sent 1587 bytes, received 20649 bytes.
Oct 24 21:32:59 garuda pppd[14873]: Connection terminated.
Oct 24 21:32:59 garuda pppd[14873]: Modem hangup

Does this mean that the modem is screwing up and as an effect of it my 
connection gets disconnected? A successive plog after this showing the 
following,

Oct 24 21:33:35 garuda pppd[14873]: Using interface ppp2
Oct 24 21:33:35 garuda pppd[14873]: Connect: ppp2 <--> eth0

Oct 24 21:33:35 garuda pppd[14873]: Cannot determine ethernet address

Is anyone else with BSNL Broadband in Chennai facing similar issues or 
is it me and my modem?

You can't prove nonsense with logic, much less math logic. These days, 
the scientific study is a distinct field called Astronomy.

I don't think I can make much sense out of the above log but going by my
long and chequered experience with MODEMS, BSNL and Internet
connectivity in general I will suspect two things:
	a) Your MODEM's health
	b) Your physical link - the phone line

BSNL has underground cables, so I don't think rains will affect much.

There are a couple of tests you can do.

At least that is what I did when I had problems.

You could try with a different MODEM by loaning one from BSNL office or
from your friend. That way you can isolate the problem(s).

Then you can monitor the LED indicators in the MODEM to glean more data.

ADSL and that too BSNL is supposed to be incredibly stable. If not
something is wrong somewhere.

Lastly you can try to accost a BSNL lineman to come and inspect the
noise levels in your phone line.

Do you hear an irritating sound on your phone?

Or crosstalk?

Dear Parth,

i would like to share my experience which was very similar to that of
yours. I use a UT300R2U Model ethernet modem, I was facing frequent
disconnection, like the dsl light on my modem will discretely go off
and in few seconds a re-establishment of connection will happen, the
reattempt of connection happened in an irregular interval. This
happened on sunny season about a month back. I had similar situation
about 4 months back as well. My telephone line at the time of problem
was clear(no erratic noise on voice line). I called the help(less)
desk at 1500, and they said that they will look into the problem. A

Assuming you are only using the official repositories, a implicit 
conflict (which is something you are running into) is always considered 
a packaging bug as outlined in

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging/Conflicts

I recommend you file a bug report in http://bugzilla.redhat.com against 
one of the packages.

In telnet sessions, your userid/password is send across in plain text - not very safe.

I don't understand why you want to use telnet when you can connect via ssh. Any particular reason why you want to use telnet?

This looks there is some kind of a hardware problem between your modem, the ADSL line, and the BSNL tel. exchange.  I would suggest open a trouble ticket with your telco.

Hi all,

Thanks @girish, @thyagarajan, @arun for your replies. Surprisingly it 
got fixed, but after I posted my query I did ifconfig to just have a 
look and found ppp0, ppp1 and ppp2 to be existing. As this sounded weird 
of having 3 ppp connections alive, I did a poff dsl-provider and all 3 
connections got closed. Then I did a pon dsl-provider to connect again 
and till now I haven't got disconnection. Hope the problem got somehow 
fixed. My modem is indeed broken long back that I have to externally 
make it connect either through a router (as I had it for a couple of 
years) or through pppoe. Anyways, thanks for your replies and if the 
problem pops up again today will nudge the BSNL helpdesk.

Ubuntu have an synaptic package manager for on-line installation in GUI mode
and it is an painfree. You may download 'gftp' package from internet from
ubuntu repositories website and install it separately. Sometimes additional
packages required to install your required package.

'Scientific technique' is based on sound 'logic' and hence will work
for any situation - only that 'logic' is not absolute. There are many
schools of logic that are incompatible with each other. Western math
and science are based on 'western' logic but since it is usually
referred to as just 'logic' we all have been trained to think that's
the correct and absolute logic.

That said, I dont think astrology and vaasthu have any basis even in
Indian logic!! My guess  is they all began as scams and have stood the
test of time only because it feeds on people's insecurity. Same reason
that godmen still find gullible followers.

I hope, it is not modem issue. Mostly the DSL issue. The above log
mesg says, modem is not getting the reply for the LCP request. May
be, you can increase the retry count OR call BSNL.

If incase you need this info, Iam with BSNL and I had frequent

That is not a useful data point at all.

I am using the same BSNL connection without a single second of
disconnection in the past three months.

That command is for the Red Hat based distributions. In Ubuntu, enter

from wikipedia
"Astrology and astronomy<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology_and_astronomy>
were
often indistinguishable before the modern
era<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_era>,
with the desire for predictive and divinatory knowledge one of the primary
motivating factors for astronomical observation.

Astronomy began to diverge from astrology after a period of gradual
separation from the Renaissance <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance> up
until the 18th century.

Eventually, astronomy distinguished itself as the
scientific<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science> study
of astronomical objects and phenomena without regard to the astrological
speculation of these phenomena."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology



And thus the existence of such a science or practice has gone a long way in
the development of modern science and simply explains the thought processes
of curious minds or the old.

The continuing human civilization defines "science" and how far are we in
the evolutionary ladder to make such terms is still unclear.

My point if this civilization has defined science as it is may be the future
would view it in a "primitive" or pseudo-state and thus totally pilfering
our present ideas.

Nevertheless DUE regard must be given to the existence of such
knowledge(pseudo-knowledge) that has been reflected or refracted into modern
science.

Though the authentic people of the old who practiced astrology are long gone
some still practice it ( how much of it is authentic or close to authentic
is the question)

PS. I personally view the current practice with an overwhelming skepticism.

Cheers

http://onlinegadgetbox.blogspot.com/2008/10/reliance-communications-offers-free.html

Any idea about the OS in these Laptops ? Is it going to be Linux ? or
is there a choice ? There is no mention of the OS in any of the press

Hi,

AFAIK,The distinct difference between Astronomy and Astrology is that
Astronomy is a science of studying celestial bodies. Astrology is a
subset of Astronomy which talks about planetary positions marking
against the given instance of a time/occasion (like birth of a baby,
ruthu(when a girl attains the mensuration cycle, Marriages, War, Even
death of a person). I do not scout for the predictions these days what
people interpret by calling them selves as Astrological pundits. I
strongly urge the fellow man to be vigil about such touts.

There were broadly accepted belief like saying in tamil "Chithirai
appan Thiruvillae", which means getting blessed of a baby in the tamil
month of Chithirai (ie  mid April to mid May in the english calender)
because of the hot(sunny)  season, the babies will have difficult time
putting the parents in hardship. This concept was latter some how
(mis)interpreted as those babies which are born in the star of
Chithirai(instead of month, Astrological chart has 27 stars in which
Chithirai is one of the star) , baby's father is set for a misfortune.

Astrology links time and planetary position  to that of Human living.
There are variety of proofs for various hypothesis which has given
effective results in knowing the change  of seasons, happening of
eclipses etc.

Vaastu is a branch of architectural engineering,  predominently
talking about  placement of assets and the comforts what one can get
out of it. Placement of well,kitchen, bed room  in a house. The
interpretation of  Non Vaastu Compliant house's misfortune has to be
probed scientifically.

>>Proof by counter-example: There are hundreds of cases where "Vaasthu" did
not work!

 Assume a house which is located in the center of North/South Pole,
The plane where there is only possible of  one  other opposite
direction(North or South) and whatever said for a architectural
compliance for a house else where will not fit there.

So in my opinion having a standard chart of Vaastu without scientific
facts compounded to it  and interpreting it only through the birth
chart of the land owner is of no use.

Summarizing it, Astrology,Vaastu are studies in the Indian school of
thought which spans through ages and cannot be discounted as a myth or
rubbish, and my emphasis is  that the prediction/interpretation which
is the big question  for examination and exploration to discover the
truth in them.

in short "explore astrology ignore astrologer"

Cheers

Since Astronomy is a science of studying celestial bodies, any subset of it is also a _science_

Are you claiming that astrology is a science?

Will Vastu work in space where there is no east, west, north and south? I
guess since is a univeral stuff...like maths..if vastu fails in realm of
space....its not science..

>>Are you claiming that astrology is a science?

IMO and AFAIK , In ancient days before the advent of modern science ,
The Science to study/know about heavenly bodies and its relevance on
the ground is called the Vedic Astrology which had 3 major ingredients
in it , The Sidhanta , The Samhita and The Hora. While the first one
Sidhanta was about the fundamentals and facts of astronomy, The
Samhita is all about the relevance /effects of heavenly bodies and its
relevant position to that of earth and its impact on the
polital/geographical and culture aspects of the world.  This deals in
predicting about War/power change overs in a country/Natural
disaster/Vaastu/ Living beings and assests While the third one is
Hora, which is telling/selecting the right(auspicious)  time to do
things.

The parent of the current day astronomy is Vedic astrology, The
current day astronomy only talks about sidhanta, While Samhita was
practiced by people who mastered astronomy,science ,geography,
commerce, economy  for forecast management of events.Samhita is often
called as the compilation of knowledge from different disciplines of
education.


There is no good person to tell us the outcome of events by
correlating Samhita's, on the contrary there are many touts who occupy
television and fooling people around saying they are astrologers and
ready to deliver solutions to  get out of the mess.As of today is
concerned majority of Astrologers cash in peoples insecurity.

In all counts , Astrology is a science.

There is no differentiation between "western logic" and logic. It is 
universal. Otherwise, feel free to cite specific authoritative 
references that makes the differentiation. Playing with semantics 
doesn't help in clarity.

Hello,
> http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/astrology.html

My entire description about astrology differs to that of what
astrology , which is mentioned in the above document.To the extend
which is mentioned in the document, it says astrology as barely a
superficial predicting practice without any scientific basis.I differ
with the document on the question "what is astrology"

To supplement my point  i would like to quote the url
http://ignca.nic.in/nl002503.htm which talks about "DATING THE
KURUKSHETRA WAR".

"Dr. R. Subramaniam in his observations also agreed that there was a
need to develop a critical editions of the verses with interpretations
in consensus with astronomy, history, archaeology, Sanskrit astrology
and mathematics.  He suggested that verifications should take into
account occurrence of double eclipse, Saturn in Rohini and the use of
all available software and data.  Another valid point he raised was
the absence of direct reference to winter solstice in the Mahabharata.
 Once that is available it was felt that 'everything could be
nailed.'"

This is what the study of Samhita is, or correlation of various
information present in "history, archaeology, Sanskrit astrology and
mathematics", to this context i said Astrology is a science.

I disagree to that fact that  to  just count astrology as a
superficial prediction practice.While Vedic astrology had astronomy,
samhita and hora,till this day ,indian astrology holds the components
what are mentioned in the Vedic astrology.

Hi !

Oh yeah , The prices too !

I dont get it . How is it free ? You are paying 36k for a laptop
(approx 23k) + bandwidth.
Why do they call it free offer ? It is almost like leasing or hire purchase.

I am more inclined to rely on scientists (186 of them) to define what 
science is rather than arbitrary definitions by lay-men. Science relies 
on logic, empirical evidence and independently verifiable claims rather 
the vague predictions alluded by modern-day astrology.  If you believe 
otherwise, you might as well as believe is fairies. I want no part of 
such delusions. You have your freedom though.

Dear luggies

Are we on  right path? 

When I ask for FOSS projects I get 2 or 3 useful mails, but about astrology - which was mentioned subtly by kg, we get tonnes email and continue for weeks.

Let us apply the scientific logic/astrology logic/vasthu/nameology/numerology - or whatever - rethink on what we are doing.

The thread was indeed interesting. Different views(obviously) - some of them
with a sound reasoning and some with just the views.
Nwayz, i happened to read this book by Gary Zukav titled "The Dancing Wu Li
Masters" -- a book that correlates Quantum physics with Eastern Mysticism -
not a very 'heavy' read. It was interesting to see the author's view ,
wherein he correlated the atomic vibrations and regurgitations with the
dancing zen masters - the masters JUST dance, least bothered about whats
happening around.

what does this prove? The only consistent thing about science is that every 
now and then established proven theories are stood on their head - or proved 
false. Quotations from scriptures should not be used to prove/disprove 
things.

how about belief in God? Are scientists allowed to believe in something that

Correct but a process is followed. Every theory advances with that 
process. Astrology is still struck in the stone age before the 
advancement of science. The playground is filled with scam artists.

Correct. Or may be our science is not advanced enough to define astrology.
The way it can't define mind and soul. And there are something you can't
prove. No matter what. But they continue to exist. Give a PC to Newton and
he will be screwed. To him the thing would be beyond the realm of then
existing science, no matter how scientific mind he has. Science doesn't know
everything thing. It still doesn't know about all the species on this
planet. Science might try to define the existence of a thing; it *cann't*
determine the existence. As Sagan said : "Lack of evidence is not the
evidence of lack."

Science doesn't know. It is a belief that scientists embrace or stay away from. Are they allowed-why not? as long as faith is called faith until otherwise proved/demonstrated and not called science there should be no conflict of interest amongst scientists.

Your area BSNL divisional manager is good :)

I am not trying to complain about BSNL, I have had stable connection
with them in the past. But in the recent few days particularly after the
rain I get frequent disconnects. BTW, I am staying near KK Nagar and the
other colleague stays in choolaimedu which comes under the same
division(Kodambakkam).

It was a science. When it was developed it was the most accurate way
of predicting paths of celestial objects. But science does not stay
static. As new data comes up, theories are updated or discarded .
Astrology considers only those objects which are visible to the naked
eye. There is no mention of planets outside Saturn, the asteroid belt,
the sizeable moons of Jupiter and Saturn and so on. Today astrology is
an obsolete model.

Throughout history we've had enough examples of something being
considered above understanding and yet human ingenuity eventually
grokked it. Today's mystery is tomorrow's science.

The exact quote is "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence".
Sagan used it in his book The Demon Haunted World as an example of how
some claims are not falsifiable and hence are assumed as truth. He did
not mean that even if something lacks evidence, it can be true.

I am in Virugambakkam (Vembuliamman Koil Exchange) and I also come under 
the same Kodambakkam division. So, the problem is attributed to one 
division? Hmm.

IMHO, that could be one's perception of what he did not mean. How mature are
the means to trace evidences? We live in a 4 dimensional world. And that
quote is not to be applied only and only in the situation you mentioned. If
otherwise be the case, such wise words would lose significant.

And thats is the tragedy of India. We fail to draw the line between
superstition and different form of knowledge, astrology in this case. We
will embrace it if west validates it. 1000 years of slavery has put us
through genetic mutation. Its happening all over India. And we will stop
only and only when we become a carbon copy of the west. Sanskrit died. Which
otherwise could have been the best language for object based programming.
Alas. Haven't learnt anything, wont learn anything.

Exactly. Science is a superior method _because_ it allows for a certain 
theory to be upturned. That means, at the end of the day, science always 
respects truth, even if it means it has to be turned on its' head - that 
is, what scientists previously considered to be established fact. They 
just discovered new conditions under which the particular phenomenon 
might not work.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb (in his book "Fooled by Randomness" I suggest 
everybody pick up a copy) refers to the same example - Astrology and 
Astronomy are different in the aspect that the latter provides a 
condition that whatever is being considered fact might be proven wrong 
by the emergence of a new fact (remember Pluto?). Astrology is a 
self-contained theory, which provides no room for its' own disproof. And 
that, NNT says is the difference between actual science and 
charlatanism. I think he is right.

Also, I find it rather strange that none of the supporters of the 
'Scientific Method' on this list referred to one of the basic tenets of 
it - that for something considered to be scientifically proven, it needs 
to be repeatable under the same conditions. Now, take your favorite pet 
theory, put it under this scale - is it repeatable? Does it provide 
conditions where it can be disproved?

+1. Also, where's the repeatable aspect? I'll start to believe in gods 
and ghosts when you can tell me the exact proportion of bribe I have to 
pay at a temple (or its' equivalent) to get a particular result. And it 
should be repeatable.

I believe religion is a concept invented by humans to be able to deal 
with randomness. A placebo, or opiate of the masses. Take your pick. 
Unfortunately, a concept that is too prone to be used for the wrong ends 
by the wrong people.

Religion is a boundary, it has only taken people apart. It has never been,
never intended to be, a bridge.

>>I am more inclined to rely on scientists (186 of them) to define what science is rather than arbitrary definitions by lay-men. Science relies on logic, empirical evidence and independently verifiable claims rather the vague predictions alluded by modern-day astrology.  If you believe otherwise, you might as well as believe is fairies. I want no part of such delusions. You have your freedom though.

Astrology is blended with facts and stories together over the period of time.
In the Kurushetra war on the 13th day after the death of abimanyu ,
Arjun challenges the Gauravs that he will kill jayantradhan (who
stabbed abimanyu from the back) before the following dusk. In the
story , it is been told that krishna created a ploy but putting his
sudharshana chakra in front of the sun which created a dusk like
illusion, jayantradhan appears to see Arjun immolates himself by
entering the   fire. Krishna takes back the chakra,Arjun kills
jayantradhan. The story of krishna's ploy is researched and found that
it was a solar eclipse happened on that day, which eventually helps in
finding the age of Mahabharata Bharatha yuda.

IMO, I do have reservations in beleif's. Comparing Modern day science
and the Vedic Astrology which spans a vast amount of time. It was
indeed blended with lot of stories which are away from the facts to
make the subject interesting for the lay men. whether it is substance
or substance less is the matter of examination and exploration of the
truths in them.

+1. EXACTLY Right. Religion (IMHO) is a doctrine - a set of rules laid down
by humans. 'God' is a by-product of it.
I would go on and say that 'God' is a symbolism. There are more ppl around
who are more experienced who can talk about this aspect in greater detail,
but to keep things short (and i might be abrasive here)- 'God' is a SuperMan
to inculcate some virtues in humans - a SuperMan who is cruel and also nice
- this is just symbolism. Idol worship for that matter give a
'materialistic' view to this aspect of SuperMan and make him more
'accessible' by humans.

Religion ,to me, is a beautiful thing; and i cannot phrase it as i strongly
opine that it is a 'feeling'.

In, other words - half baked untruths confusing mixed with potential 
facts. Imagine a branch of mathematics where 1 + 3 = 23 to make it more 
"interesting". No science works like this. This is hogwash.

-1. Nope.

Humans decide what 'religion' is. Religion is a label - Hindu, Islam, etc
etc are mere labels - they denote each school of thought. A religion was
conceived by a set of people - it was conceived to be their doctrine -
something that they should follow as part of life and hence they needed a
SuperMan('God') whom they could trust in(again, an object of their own
imagination).

And it is very much normal to have clashes between different school of
thoughts - and i truly support and advocate a debate between different
schools of thoughts - though think that it goes against the funda of
religion (which was supposed to be set-of-rules followed) by a group of ppl,
and hence this debate would be sheer waste of time.

What you are talking about is 'misunderstood-fundamentalism' - which is
sheer insanity.

Religious leaders dream of control in a society. It's only power politics.

There actually is no 'debate', its struggle to prove my religion is better
than yours. That has always been and crusades are not to make this world a
better place, but hell. There are two school of thoughts in FOSS -- GNOME n
KDE (and many more), but we don't fight. We work towards better integration
and in the end offer user the best experience. What if GNOME becomes a
religion? All non-GNOME will be barred from participating in the activities
of GNOME. They will draw lines, dig drifts.

Religion simply sucks.

Ramanujan never knew and was actually bemused by the western notion of
'proof'. However, eventually he had to change to suit the
establishment - which was much after he had made most of his
discoveries.

Astrology is one among the six Angas of Vedas.

Siksa (Phonetics); Vyakarana (grammar); Nirukta (lexicon, etymology); Kalpa
(manual of rituals); Chandas (prosody); Jyotisa (astronomy-astrology)

Please read Panini for Grammer, Vidayaranyar for Veda Bashya, relevant
Jyothisa texts before commenting.

And Ubuntu Tamil Team, is need of Astrologer who is well versed in
algorithms of how year and days are arrived at. We have Hebrew Calendar,
Arabic Calendar, Gregorian Calendar in both GNOME and KDE but yet to fit
Indian Calendar to it.

If Astrologers find they are with GNU/ Linux they will also embrace Free
Software and ask their followers to adopt Free Software :-)

We need to provide both Valluvar Era and Chithirai Puthandu and leave the
option to people to choose. Not a quarrel on this at least here.

Any Student willing to do this as project? Any one else can help?

Once again referring to the book I quoted earlier in this thread" ,
'vedanga jyotisa does not contain a single sentence relating to
astrology or prediction. - it is entirely a practical manual of
timekeeping ......'

'neither  are there references to astrology in any of the works of
Aryabhatta, Bhaskara, Varahamihira, Madhava.....'

Scientists can be sceptical but they are willing to change their mind.

When will this non-sense stop?

In what way ILUGC concerned with all the spam mails posted under this topic.. Why I should bother whose female friends goes to hell or whose astrology is better, where planets are visibile/not visible.

If anybody wants to continue this ilugc - irrelevant discussion I wish they start separate mailing list.

At this rate of spam mails I am inclined to un-subscribe this.

The funniest this is this is not marked OT.

Topics like ,

A. R.Rehman vs Ilayaraja
Veg vs Non-Veg
Atheism vs Theism vs Agnostics


are all flame -war fodders. Endless arguments with no value to others
except the posters.We look upon this forum to solve some real life
problems and issues related to Linux , open source and IT. It is a
pity that some fanatics use this forum to air their personal opinions

Dear luggies (especially students)

I have a project idea as follows:

The software should watch my mails from a mailing list.
If a thread  which doesn't contain
   Anything relavant to FOSS like linux,open source, ilug, software freedom  
     etc., ( I can give a list of key words to look for)

and if thread length exceeds 5 [ a user tunable number]

then it temporarily unsubscribes me from list.

It should watch the list( by looking at archives), ensure that
the no activity is there in the thread atleast for 2 (again tunable) days
and reactivate the subscription.


If any student is willing to do such project please contact me offlist.

It will be very useful to subscribers of ilugc.

Preferred language - perl - as that is what I know.

Needless to say - it should be free software.

Assuming you aren't being sarcastic (in which case, ha-ha you got me!)
this can probably be done with a spam filter.  Train it on the corpus
of the list to be able to be distinguish between OT and ham mails.
Then you can just tie that in with your mail setup to delete or mark
as spam the OT mails.  Subscribing and unsubscribing is not what you
want to be doing, you just want to improve the SNR of the lists you
subscribe to.

This is an interesting project for a student, not a final semester
degree project, but a fun hack.  You should post your results to the
list if you do go through with it.

does mailman have such an option that a user can invoke? Afaik you can 
unsubscribe and resubscribe - but it means that you lose *all* mails in the 
interim. It is better for the software to detect OT stuff and dump it into 
the spam folder. This can be done by finetuning spamassassin, which is in 
perl anyway. Does not seem enough matter for a fully fleged project - btw, 
this reply does not contain any of the key words you mentioned ;-)

Actually you should be looking for the e-mail ID of the person who does
the posting. That is the way procmail scoring is designed and usually
that is the way the real world works as well.

Smart people and mature individuals almost always say very useful
things. People hardly ever change and you will certainly have certain
individual's opinions that are either 180 degrees volte face with yours
(like mine for instance) and you could straight away trash them.

procmail gives you good granularity. It is a project started with good
intentions and probably a comprehensive solution space but the
implementation is too complex and spectacularly hard to use.

But this can be done. Whatever you want and more can be done with
procmail.

> and if thread length exceeds 5 [ a user tunable number]

You can specify the mailsize with procmail. For threads to be detected I
think you will have to interrogate mutt. Not sure about this.

> then it temporarily unsubscribes me from list.

As someone suggested this is an unwise option. I would rather that I
simply trash mails to /dev/null or something. Nowadays broadband
bandwidth is also cheap and you aren't really hurting your finances if
you are using a sensible ISP with an even more sensible Internet plan.

Unnecessary I think at least IMHO. What you need is good mails or the
mails that interest you. No need to scan archives since they are old and
no need to make things more complicated.

 
> Preferred language - perl - as that is what I know.
> 

There is no doubt about the strength of perl when it comes to solving
any problem and I am a very big fan of perl myself but procmail is
written in C and you only have to setup procmail rules which is a
question of common sense and UNIX familiarity rather than programming.

Now I think there are alternatives to procmail possibly written in perl
that you could use. You can search in http://search.cpan.org
in which case it would be a fun perl project that would interest
students.

I highly doubt if this would be of general use to individuals.

Everyone needs their own procmail rules. I have mine.

I also developed my own custom mailing system that fetches mails every
two hours, my laundry list of procmail rules and their corresponding
folders(one per mailing list) and so on.

It was very very hard to do this but now that I have this it helps me
keep myself abreast of what is happening in all the 30 odd mailing lists
I am subscribed to.

At the same time nowadays or times when I am really busy or when I lack
the hardware resources to pursue a particular list or lists I simply
select all and delete in mutt for the select lists I wish to ignore.

And the thread option in mutt is very useful. Sometimes sensible people
go off on a tangent and talk non technical things that do not interest
me. So I simply press 'D' in mutt which deletes all mails in that
thread.

I don't find myself doing this often though.

Another very useful trick I do is saving interesting mails in plaintext
format so I can use for programming. I do that with jQuery all the time.
I do a 'vim -' after piping the mail in mutt with '|' command.

Then I delete the headers and do a :wq to the desired file name.

There you go. A long epistle from me.

I think that making this "automatic" may not be easy. After all, if
we could do this accurately, then we could also easily identify spam. 

It should, however, be possible to setup procmail so that you can
give it a list of Message-Ids (which identifies threads) and ask it
to treat messages which refer to those Message-Ids differently. It is
a bit more complex than just filtering mail into various boxes based
on headers since you need to store all the Message-Ids of follow-up
messages as they come in.

So I would suggest an alternate project as follows.

	Extract a thread from incoming mail using procmail

Shouldnt this be trivial. As long as you know the message id in advance,
or the subject, scan and note the message id for that message and
henceforth, if you see that message id in references, write it to a
different mail box.

Or are you saying, that every thread should be put in a different mailbox.

May be i am missing something. :-)

contain the Message-Id of the subthread and so on.

So you do need to store the Message-Id's of all previous messages in
the thread in order to do something special with any new message in
the thread. You can extract these Message-Id's with "formail". So it
is really an exercise in "procmail" as Girish has said.

Hi,

It is extremely important for some one to control the chaos. Agreed!!.
This discussion was predominantly focussed whether Astrology is a
science or not. Well outwardly it is not connected to anything on a OS
or a concept/Phenomenon called FLOSS.

Positively, This discussion has made me to understand that there is a
need for Ubuntu Tamil Team in making of Indian Calendar system. I was
wondering for fine tuning a Floss software called stellarium to have
indian astrological values like creation of a birth chart. This
discussion given pointers  for me in exploring  the base question
whether Astrology is a science or not.It is not about any fanatic
values involved here.

I would call upon luggies/student who wish to contribute stellarium ,
where by we can add Indian astrological tools to the software.This is
not my bread winning job, but i would like to mentor people who are
interested in doing it. I hope and believe code contributors can
understand the substance in my view point.

Cheers

PS: Stellarium has 88 constellations which are purely based on greek
mythology.I believe Stellarium needs localization and some local value
property addition.

Hello,

Here is a link to a write-up about how to setup a Debian lenny work
environment *inside* your existing computer --- without
rebooting/re-installing etc. 

 http://www.imsc.res.in/~kapil/lenny/not_screws_and_bolts.html

This was written specifically for the Debian Workout at FOSS.in (if
it is going to happen at all) but may be of interest otherwise. 

Suggestions/criticisms etc. are always welcome.

Kapil.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

unix2dos -- UNIX to DOS text file format converter.

Summary:

Each OS will indicate the End of Line (EoL) with a Line Feed (LF,10)
and/or Carriage Return (CR,13). So after transferring a file from DOS
to Linux, we have to convert the DOS EoL format to Linux format. EoL
in Unix is LF, in Windoz/DOS is CR/LF and in MacOS is CR.

unix2dos will convert the Unix text file to DOS format.

Examples:

$ unix2dos gnu.txt -- Convert and replace gnu.txt.

$ unix2dos -n gnu.txt dos.txt -- Convert gnu.txt and write into
                                 dos.txt

$ unix2dos -k gnu.txt -- Convert and replace gnu.txt, while keeping 
                         original date stamp.

Read: man unix2dos

HTH :)

what product is that then ?

You can achieve mysql load balancing, but everything you need ( almost ) 
is already included in the main mysql server components.

What do you want to achieve ?

What did you try in order to achieve that ?

How did you fail ?

Hi,

If you could tell the complete requirement , it will be possible to help
you,
anyway do you want to implement the client for RADIUS or server or both?

there are lots of open source RADIUS implementations available online, for
both client and server.

Server:
http://freeradius.org/download.html
http://www.xs4all.nl/~evbergen/openradius/

Client:
http://wiki.freeradius.org/Radiusclient
http://jradius-client.sourceforge.net/

and so on, just google and find your suitable one , also that look through
the RFCs for the protocols informations.

Bye,
Krishna.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

mii-tool -- Show/Check/Set the MII status.

Summary:

MII (Media Independent Interface) is a standard bus which connects
network interface controllers to physical media interfaces (PHYs).
PHYs are usually located on a network interface card itself, but there
are cards available which have external MII connectors for attaching
external PHYs.

mii-tool display/checks/sets the status of a network interface's MII
unit.  Most fast Ethernet adapters use an MII to autonegotiate link
speed and duplex setting.

Examples:

# mii-tool -- Show shot status info about the network card.

# mii-tool -v -- Show detailed status.

# mii-tool -R -- Reset the MII unit to default value.

# mii-tool -r -- Restart the Auto Negotiation.

# mii-tool -w -- Watch the network interface and show if there is any 
       change in the status.(Run it and remove & reconnect the cable).

# mii-tool -F 10baseT-HD -- Forcibly set the capability to 10Mpbs and 
                            Half Duplex mode.

# mii-tool -A 10baseT-HD, 10baseT-FD -- Enable and restart Auto
        Negotiation, and advertise only the specified capabilities.

Read: man mii-tool

What exactly does your tool do?  Don't you have an abstract

Message-ID: <28095fbb0810300448k11185c23g6c955db2e68a952f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need to install the current stable debian on my machine. The problem
is that I don't have internet access to that machine, but I have
another non-*nix facility where I can download cd images. Can I find
which all cd images have the all the software I want [ a fixed list ]
with dependencies met fully.

Or if I go by a different way, suppose I install just the base system,
is there any way to know what are the *.debs dependent on a given
main/meta package.

Does a custom solution already exist [couldn't find by googling] or
should I write scripts in WIN** to parse some deb dependency database
lying somewhere in debian.org :( ?

Please put in your ideas !!

Thanks in advance

First install your system using CDs
For installing any application, you can create download scripts which  
will contain all dependencies. It is there in Synaptic menu.
For more detils refer this http://www.planetoss.com/detail.php?id=13

Hi,

you can try this option.
1. copy all the iso images of the Debian  CDs to your harddisk.
2. mount all the images using loop option in mount
     http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-to-mount-iso-image-under-linux.html
3. configure your apt-config to point to the directories of the each cd.
   http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-basico.en.html (see
Sectoin 2.4)
4. then you can use apt-get to install application.
5. the after getting everything write automation script to do all the above
in bash :)


Though it takes too much of disk space, thats the better way i found to
avoid dependency problem especially when you dont have internet.

Bye,
Krishna.

Hi,

Thanks guys !  Yes, this page[1] describes it all.  Still I think
there is a need to integrate/polish things up, a GUI interface may be,
using pygtk ??

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

lsdev - Display information about installed hardware

Summary:

lsdev gathers information about your computer's installed hardware
from the interrupts, ioports and dma files in the /proc directory,
thus giving you a quick overview of which hardware uses what I/O
addresses and what IRQ and DMA channels.

This program only shows the kernel's idea of what hardware is present,
not what's actually physically available in the system.

Examples:

$ lsdev

Read: man lsdev

Subject: [Ilugc] Announcing the Fedora Sugar Spin  
Message-ID: <490B2B43.6040100@fedoraproject.org>

Hi,

OLPC Project uses a derivative of Fedora as the operating system for 
it's XO laptops. One of the unique features of these laptops, is an 
environment called Sugar developed as a collaboration between Red Hat 
and other developers and now being maintained by Sugarlabs, an 
independent non-profit organization. The Fedora Project has released a 
new spin, a live CD with the Sugar environment by default and a number 
of additional activities including sugar-browse based on XULRunner and 
sugar-write based on Abiword. Furthermore, the Fedora liveusb-creator 
software has been updated to include support for this spin. For people 
developing the Sugar environment or those curious about it but don't 
have an OLPC system, this live cd can be a handy way to dive in.

Medibuntu repo is crucial for multimedia. Here is a link to add
medibuntu repository,

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu

then install non-free-codecs package,

$ sudo apt-get install non-free-codecs

Thats all, your linux will play whatever media format you give.

Thanks,
Mohan.

Subject: [Ilugc] Please suggest me a lightweight GNU/Linux distribution
Message-ID: <48351.1225474437@glug4muz.org>

Hi all,
 I am having a Pentium IV system with 128MB of RAM and Intex RTL 8139D Ethernet Card. When I am installing some old linux 
distributions such as Red Hat 9, Fedora Core 4 then I am able to execute X window but my ethernet card is not being detected. And 
when I am installing current linux distribution such as Fedora Core 9 then my ethernet card is being detected but X window is not 
starting due to insufficient amount of RAM. So can you please suggest me a lightweight linux distribution which can detect my 
Intex RTL 8139D ethernet card as well as I can work in X window. I will remain thankful to you for this forever.

Hi !

I am very satisfied with Slax for use in old p3.

 http://www.slax.org  based on slackware.

Works like a charm !

or use a Bebian basic installation ( Net install)  and build it up as
per your requirements. I have debian with xfce desktop working with
128 mb ram and 300 mb HD

Cheers
