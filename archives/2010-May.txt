Good.  Welcome to the FOSS world.  Please spell proper names with a

Yes, If you have enough System RAM for the "all the functions" you
want to use.  DLink and Linksys ADSL routers use embedded Linux and
they do not have any swap space allocated.

Flash memory (pen drive) has a limited number of write operation
(usually in the range of 500K or so) and creating a swap partition on
a pen drive will toast it within a few minutes.

>
> and also I want to use NETBEANS IDE, without swamp partition

Pay attention to your spelling it is swap and not swamp :)

Again, it depends on how much system RAM you have.  I have 6 GB RAM
and even though I have allocated swap space, it is hardly ever used,
even when I am running a few virtual machines with 256MB each.

>

It is similar in function to pagefile.sys in the other OS.  Here is a
good explaination of swap
<http://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/8208-all-about-linux-swap-space>
   But really you can answer such questions for yourself by Google
search.

Based on MS Silverlight technology (.NET platform).   To see what it
is like, I installed the silverlight.xpi (Mono Project) for FF but
could view only demos that were slide based (jpegs displayed within
flash plugin).   The streaming stuff did not work.   The "How it
works" is just one figure w/o any explanation of the setup.  Browsed
through some of the other links and it appears this is SAAS with a
free trial.   The site talks about open source but I could not find
any reference to open source license.

The download software is for Windows platform only.

Overall the product is promising but does this application qualify for
such a forum (Linux and FOSS)?

Once again read my mail. Depending upon the availability of the
volunteers the classes will get started from May 22.

Hi,

It gives me immense pleasure in launching Mapatree.
This is an intiative that I have been planning for quite sometime and
finally got some time to implement and also launch it :)

Please check and contribute : http://www.mapatree.org/

The site is still under development and the UI is something that needs to be
slicked up. Do report if you find any bugs or would like some enhancements.
It would be great if you can also test the site from you mobile phones and
let me know your feedback.

Regards,
Venkat

It all depends on the "application".

On the router front there are quite a few, vyatta, voyager linux,
zeroshell etc.   You can use vyatta, zeroshell in a virtual machine to
get your "hands on" experience w/o investing in any embedded hardware.
  Not sure if this is what your inquiry is about.

suddenly connection is going down and no output in minicom. I am able
to get output, only after restarting the minicom. Is there any

Sometime, the device file (ttyUSBX) associated with USB Port is also

Just fixed this issue using the following UDEV rule:
BUS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="067b", SYSFS{idProduct}=="2303", SYMLINK+="serusb"

I got the vendor and Product ids using the lsusb command.

I am using USB to SERIAL converter without any issues. But i am using cutecom instead of minicom. I never faced any port changes.

Sorry for the top post.

Is your client able to reach the server's ip? No route to host error
indicates a routing issue. For testing, switch openvpn to tcp so you can
telnet from the client and verify server reachability.

If you still have difficulty, please post your client and server side
openvpn config after masking any sensitive information.

I got the footpedal working with serial to USB converter reliably on Windoze.

As someone said you only need to write the right udev rule.

Yes, unfortunately future PCs won't have serial ports. In fact I think
even PCI will get outdated.

Just like DDR2 getting outdated now. ;)

It is a bad trend.

There is no intermediate connection disturbance with normal serial
port. I will try cutecom. If that also not working, I am planning to
go with serial port add-on card.

Hi friends,

I have been working as a foss journalist for over 6 years now. I am glad to
share with you that we are launching 'muktware.com', a complete FOSS and
Linux website. In addition to regular sections (which you can see on the
site) we will be adding more feature in the coming week which include:
1. Job Postings. If you have a job opening at you company you can publish it
on Muktware.com
2. We realize should create a comprehensive directory of Indian Foss
Professionals. The major focus of this feature is exposure. Potential
clients/employers can scan the database and connect with you.
3. Event postings. If you are planning an event, you can post it on
Muktware.com thus reaching out to more visitors.
4. Foss Yellow Pages. A comprehensive list of small and big Foss Firms,
consultants and services.
5. Mailing Lists, Projects and much more. We are also working on creating a
comprehensive directory of various Foss related mailing lists and projects
so that it is easier for the community to reach out to right people.

You can send inputs about the above mentioned features to the editor.

All these features will always remain 'free' (as in beer) for the community
members.

Please have a look at Muktware.com and share with us your valuable inputs.

Hi Bharati,

I guess you are still encountering problem with the USB 2 DB9 serial
adapter even with the udev rule you mentioned in a previous post.

It would be great if you could mention brand/model so that I can avoid
it (I am also in the market for USB2DB9 serial dongle).   I want to
use it with my HP mini which does not have a DB9 serial port.

Thanks,

Udev rule is  just to avoid changing the minicom conf file. That is
working fine.

I am still facing the intermediate disconnection issue.  Is it
specific to this HW or minicom? I don't know. Anyway my device is:
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port

Bye :)

According to the new copyright law (which is still a draft) , you can break
DRM as long as it is personal and fair use.

Hi KG,

you have very brilliantly framed your reply except that "regards, kg" part. PLEASE take note how Iam signing my mail.
By the way, if you are really witnessing "pls" for the very first time, here is my pointer:
"pls" stands for "please".

But still (as for DRM), even my google search was successfull but only i got more than one meaning.
So if no one is going to give me clarification w.r.t the context (i hope no other mail comes asking for what is w.r.t), all iam gonna assume is the expansion "Digital Radio Mondiale" for DRM, which is one of the items i got from google search.

Thanks,
Selva.

Bharathi,

When the device is being shown as disconnected, do a dmesg|tail and check if
its showing a disconnection there. It should be H/W problem and need not be
a generic one for their product. Perhaps just a faulty device. AFAIK the
change in /dev entry usually occur only if there is a physical disconnection
and there is no rule defined for the device in udev rules.

It _may_ not be a minicom issue. Check dmesg first.

Either way you look at it, one should not allow others to manage
his/her rights or restrict them. DRM is bad whatever way you look at
it: incompatibility, no sense of ownership, etc.

Great, my vendor has the same brand in stock.  Can you give the model
number please?

Also, would like to clarify a doubt.   I have been using a DB9-DB9
(F/F) null modem to connect from the computer serial port to the
"device" serial port.  Is the null modem still needed with the
USB2Serial adapter to establish connection between computer and
device?

Depends upon the device. If the device is just a dongle with one side
D9 and USB on other side, then you need a null modem cable to connect
the board with dongle.

Which version?  Visit Realtek's web site, most likely they have the
driver source.   You need to build the driver as a module (there will
be instructions on how to do it) and then insert the module into the
kernel (modprobe <module_name>.

Most ISPs have an internal web site using which you can test the speed

On the public net I have used this site.

Hello All ,

I am using this below c snippet from red hat linux RHEL5 x86_64 

================================================================

if ( socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM,0,fd) == -1 ){
perror("socketpair");
exit(1);
}

fd_read = fd[0];
fd_write = fd[1];

/* fcntl code comes here to set non blocking read */

/* set read mode to message -nondiscard mode */
if ( ioctl(fd_read, I_SRDOPT, RMSGN ) )
perror("ioctl");

===================================================================

I am getting bad address , please let me know is something wrong with ioctl.

If you are looking for DUMeter alternatives, try these:-

http://forums.opensuse.org/get-help-here/applications/399865-du-meter-substitute-program.html

http://alternativeto.net/desktop/bitmeter-2/

I think the best would be to use PRTG graph.

Hey, I'm from KCG College of Technology. We've conducted a few Python
workshops in college that went really well, and when I pointed people
to the ilugc workshops, alot of people were quite interested.

Are the dates stable enough now for me to make a flyer and distribute
in college?

Message-ID: <o2m525cf0f51005061552sf6325b7dq819d6129fa2e3be3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Foss friend,

As I promised in the previous email. We are announcing a new service for the
Indian FOSS Indusry and professionals. Here is the draft.

At the launch of Muktware.com we promised to add more features in the coming
weeks. We are announcing the launch of Muktware Yellow Pages Network (MYPN)
for the FOSS industry. This feature is available for FREE of cost to all
FOSS players.


*What is Muktware Yellow Pages Network?*
Muktware Yellow Pages Network is a powerful tool to market FOSS products and
services.

*Features:*

   - Free listing on the Muktware Yellow Pages Network (MYPN)
   - This FREE service will ensure your presence across the Web through
   search engines.
   - Comprehensive contact details so that your customers can reach you
   easily.
   - Option to upload your logo.
   - Option to be listed under more than one category.
   - Your firm will be searchable through various means ? name of the firm,
   location and area of specialization. We will keep improving these features
   over time to serve you better.

*How does it benefit businesses*
Muktware is the one-stop-shop for the Indian FOSS industry. It offers high
exposure among customers, clients, partners and big players.

Since Muktware is also a news/content and advocacy platform thus your firm
will be visible to a much more wider audience than any 'niche' Foss Yellow
Pages.

We are inviting submission/application for* Muktware Yellow Pages
Network.*<http://www.muktware.com/submit/muktware_yellow_pages/submission>
*Click here
<http://www.muktware.com/submit/muktware_yellow_pages/submission>*to list
your business now!

We will soon be launching Foss Professional feature for individual Foss
consultant/experts.

How do you intend to monetize this effort? Or is this a 'social service with
no tags attached'?

We will follow the Foss Business model -- FREE for community; but may have a

So, when you have all(/most/many) the companies listed and get good traffic,
then wake up one morning and ask for money from companies?

The service will always be 'free' of cost for the community and the clients.
That is our promise. As I said there may be additional features which might
be paid for companies.

I think you misunderstood my question (or over simplified it). I understand the

So, lets say I'm a software product manufacturer who uses FOSS tools to create 
proprietary (ie: closed source) applications or I am a software service provider 
using FOSS to provide non-free services(*):
- Can I advertise in your Yellow Pages ?
- Can I submit job requirement posts ?

cheers,

(*) lets make it simpler still, can Oracle and Skype advertise on muktware ?

There are many ways to answer your question and I can give
some tips.

If you wish to learn web programming you need to learn javascript
and basic concepts in web interactions. This PDF covers few details
 using the jQuery js toolkit.

http://gayatri-hitech.com/Misc/query.pdf

If someone can teach javascript in a LUG talk it will be nice since it is a
 great programming language not commonly taught.

On the other hand to answer your question directly if you want to
 "lift"  a project to show to your prof, then I am sure there are linux
academies that can help you with it. For a fee.

Dear friends,

Once again i thank you all of ILUGC members, especially for Abishek.

Yes you are right, the startx command starts the display at screen 1. 

However, startx is a front end command for xinit.

Once i see you replay i try read the man pages of startx command and xinit command.

while starting xserver we can give arguments for client and server. To specify the server arguments we have to use double hyphen (--).

# xinit -- :1

The above command do the tricks starts the xserver instance at display 1.

Thanks & Regards,

Raja.C

Message-ID: <85942.18947.qm@web8807.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Dear friends,

Once again i thank you all of ILUGC members, 
especially for Abishek.

Yes you are right, the startx command 
starts the display at screen 1. 

However, startx is a front end 
command for xinit.

Once i see you replay i try read the man pages of startx command and xinit command.

while starting xserver we 
can give arguments for client and server. To specify the server 
arguments we have to use double hyphen (--).

# xinit -- :1 

The above command do the tricks starts the xserver instance at display 1.

Thanks & Regards,

Raja.C

You can disable the touchpad while typing, AFAIK. Might want to give
that a try. I remember trying it before and not being able to settle on
an appropriate limit that was comfortable, but you might be able to.

Here's a link that will get you started if you feel like it:

Have you looked at Xnest  and VNC?

There are many things you can do with X.

But VNC works very well across the Internet as X is not a terribly
efficient protocol.

Indeed its not relevant.

People are using debootstrap+kernel-*-di package to install Debian on 
any device which is capable of running Debian. Once I installed base 
Debian(testing) by downloading <200MB without X. debootstrap have option 
to download packages straight from debian(testing/unstable).

debootstrap just downloads <100MB, debian-installer will download other 
packages based on our selections. AFAIK, It will take 400-500MB to 
install fully functional Debian(with X, Office etc).

In this way we don't need to waste our bandwidth by first downloading 
debian(stable) and then changing repo sources and upgrading to 
debian(testing/unstable).

Also creating DebianInstallUSB using syslinux+netinst image is more 
easier than the above method. Only the base debian will be installed. 
You have the choice to install other things. One disadvantage is, If you 
want to go for debian(testing/unstable), you need to install base 
debian(stable) first and then upgrade that base system to 
debian(testing/unstable).

In both method, we can install latest fully functional debian in <600MB.

Thanks

Neat trick!
On my openSUSE11.2 laptop I am able to start another X session using startx. I am able to switch to my original X session just fine. But when I try to switch the second session crashes. My original X session is still alive. Just wondering if anyone had seen this.

the original meaning of LAMP was Linux Apache Mysql and Perl. Now it has a 
generic meaning:
L - any operating system like Linux, BSD, Solaris etc
A - a webserver like apache, nginx, cherokee, lighttpd etc
M - a database like Postgresql, sqllite or Mysql
P - a scripting language like perl, python, ruby etc

you have to learn one each of the above 4 and also learn how to configure them. 
In addition knowledge of html, css and javascript is necessary. 
For time I would say about 6 months, depending on what you know. There are 
huge job opportunities

look in github, bitbucket, google code, sourceforge etc

True. If someone has internet connection with 250 MB monthly bandwidth
limit, they would like to go for DVDs rather than downloading.

Or someone who browses net from a Browsing Center and has a home
computer without internet connection.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_broadband_Internet_users

only about 6% Indian population has Broadband connection.

I thought Solaris' stack was SAMP, Mac was MAMP, Windows was WAMP and
OpenBSD was OpAMP.

I also heard something called GLAMP

The commonly understood FOSS business model : You write software and
release under FOSS licence. Charge customers for distribution costs,
Consulting, Training and Support.

FOSS Yellow Pages service you are building simply uses a commercial
business model where you create a network of buyers and sellers. Then
you try to monetise the traffic (eyeballs). You are using FOSS users /
companies as the traffic.

I did not know there was FOSS vs Commercial. FOSS doesn't mean programming
or working for free of cost. I also agree with that.

In Yellow Pages, the nature of 'product' is different from packaged
software. It is a service. There is no code base -- its database and
content. Mukware already releases all its content under CCL3.0 unported --
so we are releasing our content (product) under the Free Software
philosophy. In FOSS Yellow Pages, the community/readers will have
*unrestricted* access to the database, that is our promise. By unrestricted
I mean -- you won't have to pay or sign-up or register to access the
database.

However, companies who do business and make profit may not mind to get
listed. Even if you are running a company you would rather choose a paid
service than a free one.

Skepticism is good but don't say we are 'using' FOSS users. There is no
usage here as such.

I hope I have made my point clear. By the way Katonda.com has no FOSS angle
still we do a lot of advocacy stories and release all our content under CCL.

One more point. Please do not spread information that Free Software or Open
Source doesn't have any commercial angle. This is a dangerous point of view
which makes our fight even harder. Open Source was coined as an alternative
to Free Software and now there is FOSS. The entire exercise was to convince
enterprises that Free Software or Open Source doesn't mean non-commercial or
profit-less business model. The fight is against vendor-locks, restriction
to code and a health sharing based society. By the way the Subject line of
this mail chain has [commercial] in it.

FOSS is a healthy, ethical business model.

By sending out messages like FOSS vs Commercial or FOSS is against
commercial gain is damaging the entire FOSS movement. Please do not do that.

I understand your point and I am not sceptical also.

Merely pointing out that THIS service you are offering is not on FOSS
business model as commonly understood.

In most of yellow pages service, ordinary users get to use it FREE
(without paying) and businesses pay. You are following the same
practice.

Thanks I appreciate that. We do need a sustainable business model so that we
can continue our fight against proprietary evil forces.

actually the most common model which works is:

sell it, free it. That is, someone pays you to write software and you convince 
that person to release it under a foss/oss license. You sell support, setup 
distribution etc. Software that is written to 'scratch the itch' is rarely 
commercially successful. A classic example of sell it free it is Koha.

A web search can provide you the answers by yourself.  The first
result in a google search for "ubuntu lamp installation" is this
howto:

http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_lamp_for_newbies


Learning to search the web and helping yourself is an extremely
useful skill for any IT person.  Recommend that you devote time
and effort into improving your Google skills.

It seems that before upgrade, you had two partitions being mounted at
/dos and /windows. With this upgrade, those partitions are gone and
hence you are getting the error.

As you say it is not affecting anything (check whether you had a
Windows partition with any important files), you can ignore it. To
avoid this error message:

edit /etc/fstab and remove lines corresponding to /dos and /windows.
(sudo vi /etc/fstab , be careful to remeve only these two lines).

Well, looks like you need a password to log in!

Try: "mysql -u pa1 -p", and enter the password you have set for user 'pa1'.

Why don't you learn the same by yourself? The last thing anyone in this list
wants to do is to spoon feed :)

http://www.google.co.in/search?q=basic+commands+linux
http://www.google.co.in/search?q=how+to+install+software+in+linux
http://www.google.co.in/search?q=how+to+use+mysql+in+linux

Try the first three links in each of the search results, you'll get whatever
you need.

displays "ISO level3 shift".
i hope it  is used as AltGr yet i couldn't type any special character using
it.

Is there anything wrong with making money through ads?  Most of the

I dont see any of the above lines having the slightest hint of the endeavor
being wrong.
What was suggested was : a directory listing portal with subscription model
is NOT a FOSS business model; also, using ads in directory listing portal is
NOT a FOSS business model.

Btw, there is an interesting thread going on in catalog-sig DL on something
similar, where pypi data is being used by 'third parties'.

well, I had ubuntu 9.10 and window7 earlier. and one more partition for
sharing files.
but after that I formatted full disk and make four partitions, one in which
I kept window xp, two nothing and one ubuntu. while installing ubuntu (after
windows) it asked to fix the mount point for those two partition which were
empty. so I gave one as /dos and one as /windows. They dont contain any data
in it.

about editing that file. that file is readonly. I tried with vi but couldnot
do. please clear the command if any to edit it.

Thanks.

Not related, so top posting.

Two of my bread winner clients use perl extensively. Nowadays I spend
all my time with perl. ;)

It has a steep learning curve, is very USEFUL and unfortunately
nowadays it is becoming less
popular.

But popular or not it is serious business.

Please attend Raman's class and learn this fabulous tool.

Best,
Girish

It would be nice if you could use a different style to represent code
to differentiate itself from text.

You will require super user privilege to edit /etc/fstab. Give following command to edit

sudo vi /etc/fstab

Please be careful when you edit files like fstab. Read about fstab before attempting to do anything. 

Alternatively you can create appropriate filesystems on those partitions and the system should be able to mount it.

True, I will do soon.  This just a copy paste from a text file which lets me test my code .

A linked in invite to an entire group is frankly, funny..

By the way, is there a ILUGC community/group in LinkedIn?

One more suggestion is to also address Perl style guide. Perl is very
readable, depending on how one writes it. For example, in 5. Scalars,
instead of writing:

  $age=$age+1; #treated as numeric

one can write it as:

  $age = $age + 1; # treated as numeric

In 8. Conditionals-IF, instead of writing:

  if ($mark>75){

one can write it as:

  if ($mark > 75) {

In 10. Loops, instead of writing:

  for ($i=0;$i<10;$i++){

one can write it as:

  for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {

If Perl style guide practices are inculcated at an early stage during
learning, it will definitely reflect on the larger modules or programs
written, which in turn will help others read your code.

Or, alterntively, try using the GUI tool "NTFS-config". Its in the
repos. Just open Synaptics and search using "ntfs". There should be
something called "ntfs-config". Install it and go to
"System->Administration->NTFS Configuration" and see if that does the
job for you.

HTH.

To Look at mounted partitions
df
this will show you mounted partitions in your system. Identify the
device name of your harddisk from the first column. Usually /dev/hda
(hdb, hdc etc) OR /dev/sda (sdb, sdc etc) with a numeric suffix.

1. partitions of your harddisks
sudo fdisk /dev/sda -l

2. content of your fstab file
sudo cat /etc/fstab

>From these decide what is to be changed in /etc/fstab and edit the file.

The problem got solved when I edited the /dos and /windows line from /etc/fstab.
In fact I deleted those two lines from there as suggested. Now my
ubuntu boots without any such  mount error message.

Well, I guess user 'pa1' doesn't exist in mysql. Create a user 'pa1', set a
password and log in.

By default  MySQL would have only one user account called 'root' with out
any password protection. The password is empty string until you mention the
password explicitly during the installation.

1. Login to mysql using root account
2. Create new user account in MySQL
3. Grant required privilege to the user.

3. Grant required privilege to the user.
mysql>grant all on  *.* to 'pa1'@'localhost' identified by 'some_pass';
mysql>grant all on  *.* to 'pa1'@'%' identified by 'some_pass';

ref manual for  selective grant options.

4. get out of mysql
mysql>exit

5. enter into mysql with the new user which has been created
$ mysql -u pa -p
Enter password

6.Entering right password ,Bingo , you are in

My take is that ,ensure  you have entered right password.

At my company, we have played a lot with Eucalyptus and we managed to get a
cloud up and running. We used three servers for the whole setup.

	connected in windows from ubuntu via samba
Message-ID: <AANLkTikAavnTznMQ154fYs80B8zgftKvp-Bj9M_NgPKK@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Greetings.

I am doing one project for Indian Meteorological Department Chennai [1]
based on my college project [2].

The project is "Generating Change Chart" [3] and the project output is ready
to implement.
We need to take printout the output image.

I installed ubuntu lucid 10.04 and CDAT in imdc machine to implement my
project.

They are taking many image printouts everyday from windows xp machine which
is connected to HP Plotter via USB port.
HP Plotter Model is HpDesignJet500ps. [4] & [5]

I connected the ubuntu machine and windows machine via local network. The
plotter is shared from windows to local network.
I installed samba and cups in ubuntu. So that i can found the network
printer via windows samba.

If i give the print from ubuntu, it says printing process is sent and
completed the job successfully.
But the plotter does not printing the image. i.e the windows machine does
not forward the printing job to HpPlotter .

I stopped all firewalls in windows machine.

How to approach this issue.

Hi,

Its really frustrating when my browser is redirected to this crap webpage.

http://www.motive.bsnl.co.in/

Its happening frequently to me in the last few months even after 
changing my nameservers to openDNS. This page is coming most of the time 
when I first open my browser.

Did anyone know about this site. Its asking to download a self care 
software. You can see the details about the software in the page. Did 
anyone installed this software? what it is doing in your system?

My question is, how come this is possible?. Where(or at what level) the 
redirection takes place? I don't think its happening with DNS. Also I 
don't thing only google ips are redirected. I saw this redirection not 
only with google sites, but with other sites also. And finally, what is 
the real motive for bsnl to ask the customers to install this self care 
software?

Waiting for experts opinion.

Thanks,
Mohan R

I too faced this problem a few days back. I observed it happens when there
was no data transfer between your machine and the internet for a few
minutes.

Most likely, the router at BSNL that connects to the client is responsible
for this! I do not know the technicalities though!

As for the motives, I would'nt be surprised if even BSNL does not know :-)

THIS IS NOT WHAT THE CLOUD IS ABOUT. ;-) Yes I'm screaming.. Desktop

Virtualization IS NOT cloud computing. This has got very little to do with
the cloud. It is true that when a company needs more cpu power, they
purchase it.

The only true major hurdle with this type of implementation is the security

We are waiting for to complete the Anna university examination and we will start processing on that. We will call the people for online test on Linux/Open source on 24th, May. We would like to know their commitment instead of simply approaching for the certificates. Later we will conduct the HR interview and select the people.

I hope we will start the internship from the end of May or June first week.

I am guessing that you connected the printer to the Windows machine
and that you want to print from Ubuntu.

Does the printer have an Ethernet port?

If it has an IP address see if it runs LPD.

$ nc -v <printer-ip> 515

As you say that it is a USB printer I wonder how to print from Linux.

I have no experience dealing with such printers.

I have always been able to print from UNIX using LPRng and a2ps.

Just now did a full reset. But after resetting, my browser came up with

Is it not happening today? I googled about this and came to know that 
even installing the software is also not going to prevent this 
redirection. Is it true? Did you install their software?

HP Designjet 500 (42") is supported on Linux. You can print to it using
Ghostscript drivers.

However, this printer only comes with USB 1.1 and parallel port
interfaces. Would you be able to connect your computer to this printer
directly via USB to see if it works?

If that doesn't work, you may have to print it out as PDF or some other
format and then send that file to the XP machine and print from there. I
have read somewhere that this printer does give issues with SAMBA.

Prem

For me also the same thing happens. But it happens only for the first
http request after the BSNL modem boots up. Don't know how to avoid
this.

Motive , as it is said is a self care software provided by BSNL. I installed
it in windoze. It helps to configure the modem for beginners with step by
step method including screenshots and illustrations.
I did a factory reset and reconfigured my modem using it. It was very easy.
The download also contained step by step instructions with screen shots for
configuring in Linux.

I think the redirection takes place at the router and it is set by some
program, so we cant do much about it.

I don't think its happening with DNS. Also I don't thing only google ips are

We give these talks in many places and all these talks reach only some groups.

If we create such a video and spread it, it will reach more people.

Subject: [Ilugc] My deceptively simple shutdown script after music playsq
Message-ID: <AANLkTil5PZvyn5VahQu6sTFoam0xBciT5Rynq4CjNvA9@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Here is a very simple recipe for a common need.

I have been wanting to automatically switch off my machine after the
music stops playing.

This could be at night or during daytime when you lock your house and leave.

This simple shell script does a great job when run as root.

But remember that you should be able to switch off the machine in
software. APM support has to work.

Nowadays it is no issue.

Here is the silly program that does the job.

[-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------]
#!/bin/sh

while [ "1" = "1" ]; then
do
           sleep 15
           echo "Checking for mplayer..."
           stat=`pgrep mplayer`
           if [ "$stat" = "" ]; then
                        shutdown -hP now
           fi
done
[-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Since I only play music using mplayer this works for me. You need to
choose some other audio/video player in
case you are not like me.

Hope it is useful in some strange way.

Thanks.

#!/bin/sh
echo "Checking for mplayer..."
stat=`pgrep mplayer`
 if [ "$stat" = "" ]; then
                       shutdown -hP now
  fi

Love to save the above script as the watchdog.sh. Instead of going for a
infinite loop with sleep command,  I would add script along with watch as

$watch ./watchdog.sh

This is for the people who feel that they missed vital
session/talk/meeting/workshops. Like one I still feel for the Kapil Hari's
Virtualization Workshop in late 2008 [1].


Good idea but need a lot of effort to bring it to reality.


[1] Not sure year is correct

Try the following in the <command> section of an /etc/crontab entry?

  pgrep mplayer || shutdown -hP now

That would mean other processes can see the password on the same
machine. What are you trying to do?

Shakthi,

I think this a lot.

I normally use && like

$ make && make test && make install

Of course for make install you gotta be root if it uses the normal prefix
during ./configure.

I digress. Sorry.

The or operator || is really cool.

But I would not put it in crontab. If the machine switches off doing imp
work and listening to music there is a problem.

I want to run the script manually.

Thanks for this tip.

Very useful.

-Girish

Ravi,

I have not used watchdog or watch anytime.

Thanks.

That should also work.

Ah I later realized that you are talking about the watch command which
 I learnt recently. That is nice too.

You are just calling the script watchdog.;)

Okay.

Well then mplayer would still return as running for pgrep.

And not shut down since the condition would not be met.

I managed to fix it myself. There was a small bug in library  changing this
635 $val = htmlentities($val);
to this
636 $val = htmlentities($val, ENT_COMPAT, $this->_defaultEncoding); and got
my problem fixed.

I do something similar for overnight downloads on my netbook.  The

My idea is the Language used should be the normal Tamil we speak in and not
complete localization, because  it may not reach the college students.

Solution: I am not sure whether you forgot the root password or you are
trying out the wrong password with a typo. What ever  it may be. The simple
solution is to reset the password for the root account of  the Mysql [2] .

Message-ID: <AANLkTikfWgcPYBktFbL32zdp_Pa3gL651lh1k1jVs8r4@mail.gmail.com>

I am looking for a letter quality dot matrix printer that can handle
single page as well as continuous feed paper.

Preference is Epson - but open to other brands as well.

This search gives a long list
<http://www.openprinting.org/printers/manufacturer/Epson> which is
quite daunting.

A colleague recommended LX300+II but it is not listed above.  I am not
sure if the generic dot matrix (24 pin) driver will work with it or
not.  I do not want to spend Rs 7500 and find out that it will not
work with Linux :)

Please suggest brand/model that you have personal experience with
under Linux environment (heavy duty usage @ law firm).

Thanks in advance.

You'd need to consider a license for the font to enable it to be
packaged for distributions.

Epson and TVSE dot matrix printers work well. TVSE supplies ppd file also. For epson you can use what is available with cups.

I feel cups and dot matrix are not good combination. The printing quality and speed is generally very poor. In my opinion DMP are fit for text only printing, though graphics supported. 

For text only printing I avoid cups, and use a perl scripts to simply use cat >/dev/lp?? with appropriate printer controls. Speed in this method is very good.

LQ printing is better done by printer settings than through cups/other software.

I need model no. so that I can tell my distributor what I am looking
for.    Further search on the LX 300+II shows it is not well supported
at all under Linux.

The environment is a law office - so it is 100% text in legal briefs.

I am presuming it would be specific to printer brand/model.

LQ 1050+ would be a no brainer.

Just make sure to check about interface (USB/Centronics) on both the
ends of the cable.

It definitely is related to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook#Financials

Added to that facebook has to implement some blocking features thanks
to coroprate lobby in some countries.

Friends.

At kanchilug, we are planning to send weekly meet info via sms
to all the members.

We may send "one day one command" via sms too.

To send sms via program, we wrote scripts.

http://tuxworld.wordpress.com/2009/11/11/sms-frame-work-using-gnokii-ruby-csv-sending-bulk-sms/

http://tuxworld.wordpress.com/2009/10/30/sms-frame-work-using-gnokii-ruby-mysql-sending-bulk-sms/



We decided to buy a sim card for this and use it for only sms purpose.
To implement this, we need a separate mobile phone to connect with the pc.

Please suggest a cheap mobile that has a data cable to connect with pc.

Is it possible to get it around 1500 INR?

Thanks.

Suggest you use something like Google SMS Channels or Twitter:
    http://labs.google.co.in/smschannels/browse

You can post using the web api and subscribed users can receive
the messages via sms.  Supports multiple languages, bulk sms, etc.

Twitter has resumed sending SMS updates to Indian cell phones.


If you want to do everything yourself, then take a look at Katik:
http://code.google.com/p/usablemobile/

Katik runs entirely out of a Symbian 60 phone, no computer needed.

We tried this already.
Too slow. SMS reaches after 2-3 days too.

We have computers and no budget to buy fancy symbian 60 phones for
this operations.
Thats why searching for a cheap mobile to connect to computer.

Any idea on cheap mobile?

I have a Samsung C3010S that I bought for 3.3K during November, when
it was just released. The prices must have gone down now. It can send
and receive SMS's using gammu.

If second hand is Ok, then you have a lot of options.
Finding one with a data cable might be difficult. Go for a one
with Bluetooth.
Take your laptop to the bazaar and check if the phone's got DUN (Dial up
networking) profile thro' Bluetooth.
You should find a lot of phones in the second hand market at your price
band.

Arun

There is some manual effort involved but you can check on ebay.in for prices of 
all the phones listed here:
http://www.gnokii.org/docs.shtml
(note, there are more than 1 phone in a number series, go to the section to see 
actual model numbers)

Also, as Arun suggested, you can take your laptop to the bazaar, connect the 
phone (with cable or bluetooth) and run:

$ gnokii --identify

if it can identify the phone, it is very likely gnokii can also send sms through it.

cheers,

What about second hand mobile or Out dated mobile?
It may be in your range. Only thing is Battery Backup of mobile. If separate
charger socket is available, then we can use it.


Another one is SMS Module supplied by an network provider ( Airtel, Aircel,
Vodaphone etc). Try this also.

In our concern, we are using EPSON make. It's performance is good.

One more thing is some dot matrix printers comes with Linux Driver CDs. It
is also supporting serial and USB ports.

Boot the kernel with --no-fb option(no framebuffer).

It might work.

You could buy a sancharnet dialup account - 50Hrs for Rs250+tax with one year validity. You can send a 1000 sms via webmail in bulk. No need for a mobile. Try to get a good username (max 11 Char) which will be displayed at the beginning of the sms.

Boot into runlevel 3.  mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf out and remove the

Message-ID: <AANLkTil424Qlzsx_cNVHi1LMiofyFdYZwF5dAbHhFZXk@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Chemtool

what it is:

Chemtool is a GTK+ based 2D chemical structure editor for X11. It
supports many bond styles, most forms of text needed for chemical
typesetting and splines/arcs/curved arrows.

Drawings can be exported to MOL and PDB format, SVG or XFig format for
further annotation, as a PiCTeX drawing, as a bitmap or as Postscript
files (several of these through XFig's companion program transfig).

Features:

The package also contains a helper program, cht, to calculate sum
formula and (exact) molecular weight from a chemtool drawing file. Cht
can either be called directly by Chemtool or on the console.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimT5K7TBbK39Ab-98js8XP_1xb-S6NibQr_bZQl@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Though I don't have time to send tips anymore(not right now), i will
try to send
whatever valuable information I have from time to time.

$lftp http://www.openbsd.org/
lftp> mget *pdf
lftp> quit

LFTP is what wget should have done. ;)

LFTP can talk HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SFTP and so on. ;)

There is no protocol it cannot talk.

Whenever I struggled in vain to make wget understand simple things I
now realize I should have simply
used lftp instead.

Heck, it was time wasted. ;)

And job not done. Not nice.

Anyway I don't wish that you go through the same troubles.

LFTP can download recursively in mirror mode. This is useful for FTP
mirroring but there i no reason why this
can't work for HTTP.

You can write a script or HEREDOC and invoke with

lftp -f script.lftp

$ cat script.lftp
 open -u user, pass ftp://host:port/path/
  ls
  quit

There is also a queue facility in which it does background transfers
like wget -b.

More later.

Have fun.

This was extremely useful. I was not aware of this trick. Thanks.

I wish to add that lftp is particularly useful for sftp, in that it
supports tab completion (unlike sftp). Also useful is the "mirror"
command, which can be used to recreate a remote structure on the local
machine (or vice-versa with the -R argument).

Thanks to all for giving your suggestions/recommendations regarding
dot matrix printers (DMPs).

Mahesh Pai (ILUG-Delhi mailing list) convinced me to go with a laser
printer.   I ended up ordering a Samsung ML 6140 - Linux drivers
provided on CD.  "install.sh"  took care of the driver installation
(Ubuntu 9.10 desktop) and it was in operation within a few minutes of
installation.

In the DMP research process I found:

1. DMPs can cost  more than their laser counterparts.
2. Most DMPs are designed for continuous feed paper (with multi-copies
carbon/impact).
3. Some DMPs handle multiple cut sheet paper with special feeders; I
enquired with vendor Tech Support  about dealers/ who carry the
feeders without any success.  Default is one sheet at a time.
4. Amongst the brands I researched for Linux driver support - Wipro
DMP models clearly stated driver support for Linux.

hi

an educational institution has decided to go completely open source. Among 
other things they are required to have 2 labs with 60 machines each. They have 
been advised to go in for:
http://www.ncomputing.com/
which will save money and energy. I cannot make out if this is an open source 
solution. Apparently they have to buy 10 full fledged machines to which they 
attach the ncomputing box which costs 4000. To the ten machines they add 6 
keyboards, monitors and mouses.

I was planning to suggest ltsp - but what would the economics of that be? 
would it compare with the ncomputing solution? what kind of thin clients are 
available and at what cost?

It is not advisable to choose ncomputing solution, especially if the institution prefers
to go completely with open source.

>which will save money and energy. I cannot make out if this is an open source 
>solution. 

NComputing supports both Windows / Linux and it is not open source, and they use
their own vspace Desktop virtualization software in their NComputing device.

Apparently they have to buy 10 full fledged machines to which they 
>attach the ncomputing box which costs 4000. To the ten machines they add 6

It is better advised to go for a low cost Intel Atom Board + procesor with 512MB / 1 GB RAM
using PXE for network booting supporting LTSP.

>
>I was planning to suggest ltsp - but what would the economics of that be?

The above mentioned setup for LTSP would be more economical option for the institution without vendor lock-in
problems and when compared with ncomputing solution, LTSP is much a better option
both in terms of economical and technical capabilities.

The following things are required for setting up LTSP thinclient

1. Intel ATOM processor + Board (Rs. 3,000)
2. 512/1GB RAM
3. Mini-ITX Cabinet

If the institution requires any suggestion / demo on this kind of setup, we would be glad to 
assist them.

LTSP setup few advantage
a. As suggested by Basker go for ATOM processor based cpu. A full set can
   be assembled at about Rs.10-12K (inclusive of monitor+kbd+mouse). This
   avoids vendor lockin. If required can be used as regular system by
   addition of hard disk.
b. Existing P-IV systems can be used throwing away hdd,cd-rom etc. This
   will reduce the cost further down.

Disadvantage
Generally all consumers want service/warranty support from the supplier themselves, they prefer large corporates over smaller ones.

The thinclients available from HCL and others are very costly. LTSP is economical only with assembled sets or old PC's.

Get the college to ask the vendor for reference of implementations where
have installed NComputing + Linux.  Most implementations will be on
Windows and that too WinXP.  Vendor support for such solutions is a
big mess.

Recommend a 100% open source solution like LTSP which has large
community adoption and support.

Since it is a college, why can't a student community be created around ltsp - setting up, maintain and improve? 
KG do you think the college is receptive to such ideas - so that TCE/Madurai kind of setup can be replicated - this time  around ltsp.

OpenOffice.org announces Summer Internship Programme

Mentors will guide students through OpenOffice.org development
Bounties up to 3.500 EUR per enhancement and bug fix

The OpenOffice.org Community today announced the launch of its Summer
Internship Programme. Students from all over the world are invited to
take their first steps in OpenOffice.org development. A cash bounty up
to 3.500 EUR per enhancement or bug fix is available. Participants will
benefit by learning from experienced mentors from the worldwide
community, gaining valueable skills -- not to mention the opportunity of
coding for millions of users worldwide.

Mathias Bauer, a lead developer of OpenOffice.org, says, "We think that
working on OpenOffice.org is real fun. On the other hand, we kow that
it's also a challenge for new developers. But skilled students who have
mastered the first steps together with their mentor, will have a great
opportunity to work on interesting features in one of the biggest and
most important open source projects."

Cor Nouws, member of the OpenOffice.org Community Council, adds:
"OpenOffice.org is an exciting and challenging project. From our
experience, we know that interested students can learn lots of cool
stuff. Implementing a feature for millions of users worldwide is a
perfect reference for your resume -- and something you can be really
proud of!"

The Summer Internship Programme follows the community's previous
bug-bounty programmes that have been successfully organized in the past.
It runs from May 31st to October 31st and accepted students are required
to work full-time for a period of about three months on their project.

Space is limited, so students are encouraged to apply for the programme now!

I second the opinion as well.  The base devices cost about USD 250;
the do it yourself Atom solution is in the same ballpark with more
memory (and flexibility).  Also beware of other clone vendors; their
boxes look identical to the NComputing device and for software they
give the "cracked" versions of the incumbent's software!

Agree,  I could not get any straight answers from the NComputing sales
team in India (about a couple of years ago).  However, I have seen the
clone devices work with RHEL 4.x at a vendor demo.

Besides, Baskar's solution - there is Thinstation.   You can build
custom thin client images using the TS-O-matic

Enjay has been supporting / providing open source solutions, but their thinclient is not free / opensource.

The best FOSS thinclient I have ever seen is Cult Thinclient (http://cult-thinclient.sourceforge.net) which can be setup in few minutes and also best suitable for academic environments where they might need for both windows / linux.

That is a great thing. Why not we join them in implementing ltsp? I am
willing to share my experiences and help them in whatever way I can.

We can probably start with a small setup of 5 system using existing PCs.

they need 60 systems and do not have existing PCs - they have no aversion to 
paying commercial rates for installation and set up, only the do not want to

If the college is interested, we are ready to implement the complete LTSP setup, providing the complete
upcoming Fedora-13 (or) Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Distro repo. without looking for any commercial interest.

how much would it cost for a lab with 60 systems - all they need is office, mail 
and internet browsing and decent speed. (I will contact you offlist for your 
fees) but I want the cost discussion on list so that we can all get an idea if 
this type of thing comes in future - and it will come as a 60 computer lab is 
an AICTE requirement.

These are good cabinets but a bit on the expensive side.

I have switched to X-Tech Nettop cabinets, they are equally good
(3year warranty) and they cost about Rs 1100/- in Mumbai.  I am sure
you can negotiate a lower price for 60 units.
Please check availability in the Chennai retail channels.

Since prices are missing for the server - I am sharing the numbers
from my recent purchases.

1TB WD/Seagate Enterprise edition cost is about Rs. 10K/each
(Suggest 2 disks for sw RAID1 configuration)

DDR3 2GB RAM stick  (unbuffered non-ECC) is about Rs. 3200/- (Kingston)

Intel server motheboard is about Rs. 10K  (suggest Tyan/Supermicro as
server motherboard options besides Intel)

Xeon quad core CPU (2.4GHz) is about Rs. 10K/-  (I believe AMD server
CPUs are probably in the same ball park)
(I have a Core 2 Quad as well as Xeon Quad - running KVM on both.  I
wish I had not bought the Core 2 Quad - it is a desktop CPU; go with a
server CPU  Xeon or AMD equivalent)

A server class VIP cabinet with 650W SMPS cost is about Rs. 6K/-

I use a LaCie external DVDWriter (USB 2.0) that is shared amongst all
servers/desktops; cost about Rs. 4K  (worth it)
(when not in use, I store it in dust proof packing - lost several
internal units because of dust)

My two cents.

Dear Shyam,
    Instead of NIS I would suggest you to use LDAP which has lot of 
advantages.

No configuration is required at client side in ltsp. All ltsp clients work only on the server using whatever authentication system the server is configured for. If you setup NIS in the server then all clients will use this.

Dear Pluggies,

Pleased to inform you of the 'call for papers' for the inaugural
IndicThreads.com Conference On Upcoming Technology.

The 2010 conference will be held on 20-21 August in Pune, India.
"Cloud Computing" was chosen as the topic for the 2010 conference,
considering it's potential to transform software development as we
know it.

Like with most upcoming technologies, many are aware of cloud
computing, but few are sure of what it is capable of or how to go
about adopting / migrating to the cloud.

The conference is an attempt to distill the truly useful info from the
jargon and to highlight the what, why & how of cloud computing.

Do visit http://u10.IndicThreads.com for conference details &
http://u10.indicthreads.com/call-for-papers/ for the call for papers.
Do submit/share as appropriate.

Thanks,
Harshad

Lets create a great momentum of FOSS advocacy. I request everyone of you to
go back at your schools and tell them to un-install all pirated version of
Software. Install and give demo of Linux based Operating system.

Subject: hello
To: Narendra Sisodiya <narendra@narendrasisodiya.com>


hello sir

I was not able to reply you regarding the blog entry you asked as my exams
are going on.
Here's a brief of it.

Last month i went to my school to meet my teachers. There I found favourite
teacher who taught us Informatics Practices(we had only that option for
computers at my school time).
When I entered the Lab, ma'm wasn't there and I just started interacting
with the student who were having there class there. The discussion slowly
headed towards open source and Linux stuff. It made me wonder that just a
name Linux made them excited. Most of them were interested in linux but
feared that it's tough and you need to learn too many commands to work on
it. Some of them were familiar with Linux(Ubuntu OS in particular) but most
of them imagined linux as a black screen with no fantasy options at all.
Till then ma'm had arrived and I told them about the scenario and requested
her to allow me to give a small demo. Well, as expected she agreed. Luckily
I always keep a live cd in my bag, so in the next hour I presented them with
all the features of linux( mostly non technical though) such as synaptic
package manager, games, inbuilt open office and most importantly that it is
free, virus free, you virtually don't need to buy anything that you need for
linux.
Secondly, as the students were quite interested enough and excited they
turned the discussion towards  FOSS. After explaining all stuff about FOSS,
the most exciting part cams. I presented before them the source code of many
softwares (even simple C++ editors) which were written in Java and C++ (I
chose these as they are learning these in school it was more appropriate to
get them in FOSS).

I installed Ubuntu on 3 PCs myself and asked the students to install on the
rest.
My teacher got so impressed(she had used it earlier but wasn't so
comfortable) then asked me to do the same for school's office. So next day,
I installed it in the office also with ubuntu server on one PC and
internetworked them all. Everything is now getting on linux there now. Oh i
forgot to mention that principal's office is also on a dual boot with
fedora. Well over a month now, no problems at all and most importantly I
didn't hear office people complaining that there computer have crashed(the
reason I used to hear when I was a student there [?])

Note: Sirif some data is inappropriate or not of any concern you can cut or
modify any of the part if you wish. I have written this to give an idea what
i have done (not a very big thing but got a satisfaction that I have done
something)

Thanks

My guess is that another instance of apache must already be running at port
80. Hence when you try to start it again at the same port, it says 'address
in use'.

Rather than give you the script it would be better if you write (you
should be able to do in one or two lines in the script) your own
script based on the usage of the following tools:

1. 'netstat -nt' to list all TCP connections without DNS resolution
2. 'egrep'  to filter out "ESTABLISHED" connection lines from above
3. use 'wc -l' to count the number of "ESTABLISHED" connection lines
from above step. and save it in a variable no_conns
4. invoke '/sbin/poweroff' if no. of $no_conns is -eq 0
5. Test the script and when you are satisfied that it works then
6. In /etc/cron.d/  create a file with crontab entries similar to what
may already be there in that directory.
7. Edit the min. field for frequency (interval in mins.) and hour
field for the time duration during which your script should be
executed.

Your "power off" script will run every 'x' min. interval during hours
a through b If you are setup is correct (script and cron entries).

Caveat:  it is assumed you log off from all your ssh/telnet sessions
and also remove any browser tab that refreshes it's respective page
every so often.

Hi
Yes, Is there any registration? also, is it ok if I come a little late, 
for the second talk or so, because I have some already scheduled work to 
be completed just before this, so it will  take me that much time to 
reach there.

Best of luck boys and girls.

I hope you have fun and learn too.

I am very glad to note the overwhelming response for python.

Have something for perl too.

I am sure Raman would agree if not more folks. ;)

This looks pretty comprehensive to me. Good idea.

Remember, poweroff may not work on all architectures.

You might want to check http://code.google.com/p/php-excel/ which was
posted here a few days back.
Also see http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/

That's just one aspect. You will find a lot of options otherwise in
other languages too.

Subject: [Ilugc] ssh tricks to access any private IP machine without VPN
Message-ID: <AANLkTimHCkHp19TBxn_QihSqxUKP6eGbTYUypfICcsW6@mail.gmail.com>

Guys,

You have plenty of concepts in networking that are very hard to grasp.

And networking is my focus area.

In today's Internet any cool technology uses networking in some way or other.

My rich knowledge in networking helps me do several things with a lot
of constraints.

In several cases even if you pump in a lot of cash you cannot achieve
the goal you have without
 knowledge.

The main complication on the Internet is caused by NAT. Most of us
work on private IPs and you cannot
access the home machine from office and vice versa.

Unless you have a VPN.

By the way VPN also does encryption and you can access any remote
application. This is not like that.

My solution is very simple.

First what is the goal?

Today I have many clients scattered over Chennai and I have machines
at home and office.

Nearly all of them run OpenBSD and some linux. I also have a VPS in US.

The VPS runs Debian and it has a public IP that is static of course.

Now all I have to do to connect to any of the machines I run in my
client locations or home/office is this:

             a) Open an ssh remote forwarding connection to my public IP in US.

Office A:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
                       $ ssh -R 3000:localhost:22 1.23.4.47
                         <login and stay connected>

Each machine will use a different port.

So from my other client office I start port forwarding like this.

Office B:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
                       $ ssh -R 4000:localhost:22 1.23.4.47

Just replace my VPS IP(1.23.4.47) with your public IP.

Now all you have to do to access your machine in Office A or office B
is to first login to your VPS.

$ ssh 1.23.4.47

Then, access the local port that is forwarded to the remote location.

$ ssh -p 4000 localhost

for logging into office B

and

$ ssh -p 3000 localhost

for logging into office A.

This way I can access any UNIX machine anywhere through my public IP.

This also does not take up any resources. You don't need the
complexity of VPNs and you
don't need to configure anything in machines not under your control.

You can do ssh port forwarding in your BSNL MODEM by associating a
public port with a private IP and port.

But this method is much better since you won't get this access at many
places and certainly not your client offices.

Another thing is that this MODEM port forwarding/DNAT/ TCP redirection
works only for one machine.

Whereas with our idea we can access any number of machines behind the
same MODEM.

Sorry if this was too complex.

You need a lot of context to follow this cool idea.

Thanks.

Ever yours,
Girish

FWIW - another cool trick that works for my operations.

1. Pay Rs. 1000/year to MTNL (Mumbai) for a static IP Triband DSL.
2. I have my company DNS served by a gratis DNS service like
everydns.net (they were recently bought by DynDNS) but there are still
other free DNS hosting services.
3. Define a hostname eg.  <dslwanport.mydomain.com>.
4. With full disclosure to client, define a port forwarding rule at
client router to let my staff enter into their network from
<dslwanport.mydomain.com>, directly from our office systems.
5. Next step remote network monitoring using above concept.

The Rs. 83.33/month for static IP is well worth it.   Alternately, you
can map your dynamic IP via DynDNS as well but that would using one of
their domain names.

The static IP also allows me to come into my office LAN when I am on
the road, I point my client to <dslwanport.mydomain.com>.

FWIS, also take a look at TeamView, Logmein etc. for remote
administration/access (free for non commercial use).

Arun,

I forgot to mention that I pay 9$ per month to my US VPS.

But this trick will work with a Dreamhost webhosting too.

That costs 100$ a year.

All you need is a public IP.

Subject: [Ilugc] conky and cycle for web based network monitoring
Message-ID: <AANLkTilkx2CTaFHczXv9Q-AbCupuJCJM9x901CeVjB3o@mail.gmail.com>

It seems I am on a roll today.

Long long ago, very long ago I sent a mail to LUG about the fabulous
jQuery cycle plugin.

And in Dec 2007 I had given a LUG talk in IIT on jQuery.

I am not sure if I will give another LUG talk. Very unlikely.

But I can surely mail.;)

I had to do server monitoring for one of my  clients and I ended up
using the sexy conky tool for it.

But I had to do a lot of jugglery to make it work on the web.

First I needed this script to make conky write to a fake X server Xvfb.
-sh-3.2$ cat conky-setup
#!/bin/sh

# This script will not only start conky but also refresh the image
every 5 seconds

# Watch the fun ;)

Xvfb :5 -screen 0 1280x1024x24&

export DISPLAY=:5.0
xsetroot -solid lightslateblue
conky  2>/tmp/f.txt
sleep 3

windowid=`grep 0x /tmp/f.txt|cut -d\( -f2|tr -d \)`
while [ "1" = "1" ];
do
        import -window ${windowid} /san1/sysadmin/navigator/conky.png
        sleep 3
done

I start this manually with

$./conky-setup&

Or you can put it in ~/.profile. Your choice.

Now the ImageMagick import(1) command dumps the current conky output to a file.

I need to display this on the web with cycle transitions.

Here is the html.

-sh-3.2$ cat conky.html

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"

Hi,

 I know some of them are:

1.KAD - KDE aided design is a complete
2D CAD system based on QCad by ribbonsoft. It is suited for both beginners
and experienced CAD users.2.CYCAS is a piece of architectural software for
drafting and design in 2 + 3 dimensions.

3.CAM Expert is the commercial big brother to Qcad. It has a similar
interface to Qcad, but with extended features leaning more towards the
creation of NC-programs.

4.CADDA software is a true CAD/CAM solution that offers CAD and CAM
functionality within one user interface. CAD-data can be imported as 3-D or
2-D models
.
5.Varicad offers 3-D solids and 2-D drafting at a very nice price. The user
has the options of the icon panels or the pull-down menus. Although I like
the text-based menu (pull down), I did
find the ``Commands'' nested a bit too deep.

I just use "at", but I should look into something more sophisticated.

My typical "at" usage:

Windows users have plenty of third-party tools like GotoMyPC, TeamViewer, etc. to overcome the Public IP problems.

Now, TeamViewer is available for Linux also.  Here is the download link:

FWIW - another cool trick that works for my operations.

1. Pay Rs. 1000/year to MTNL (Mumbai) for a static IP Triband DSL.
2. I have my company DNS served by a gratis DNS service like
everydns.net (they were recently bought by DynDNS) but there are still
other free DNS hosting services.
3. Define a hostname eg.  <dslwanport.mydomain.com>.
4. With full disclosure to client, define a port forwarding rule at
client router to let my staff enter into their network from
<dslwanport.mydomain.com>, directly from our office systems.
5. Next step remote network monitoring using above concept.

The Rs. 83.33/month for static IP is well worth it.   Alternately, you
can map your dynamic IP via DynDNS as well but that would using one of
their domain names.

The static IP also allows me to come into my office LAN when I am on
the road, I point my client to <dslwanport.mydomain.com>.

FWIS, also take a look at TeamView, Logmein etc. for remote
administration/access (free for non commercial use).

I have also used it.

Yday I had set at(1) to upload my file after p7zip whch is very slow.

Sometimes I don't have the patience of girls to sit and hand hold my computer.

I feel like cycling and getting some fresh air.

Yday I had done this and I kept checking my VPS. How can she disobey my order?

I came all the way from my office to find that the power had gone off. ;)

Raja clearly demonstrated the best way at should be used.

You enter commands directly into the at STDIN and press EOF Ctrl-D.

You can instead issue a shell script file as well.

But remember this will not work like cron. atd has to be running.

Don't get fooled into thinking that at will give some future benefit
until you test it with
simple print commands or music playing commands.

I love the flexibility of timespecs you can give to at.

When did you get it?

It is running.

You can await my article at

I am not into the web development sector much, but I guess you can start
with simple/small free lancing projects if you are planning to do something
with php. Or you could also think about something challenging and try to
implement it as a way to learn those skills.

You don't mention the college and your academic credentials. ;)

Do you want to do Phd in cloud computing?

Why?

What has php got to do with cloud computing?

You say you want job opportunities in India and you also say you want to do Phd.

I am confused.

For doing Phd you have to live without income for 5 years or with a stipend.

And even after 5 years there is no guarantee you will get a 'Dr' in
front of your name.

What is your goal in life?

In my case I had a lot of difficulty choosing my goal when I had around 2 years
experience.

I also had a plan to do Phd abroad but I quickly dropped the idea. It was very
painful for me to come to terms with my confusion but things started
stabilizing
after a few months.

It is very important to know what personality type you are.

Are you a working type or an academic kind?

Or can you start a company?

Great start. ;)

My academic credentials were similar. I got around 66% and I studied ECE.

But I studied a very long time ago.

Good idea. I will second that.

I do lot of research solving real life problems day in day out. Some
of the networking
problems I solve are world class. No academic environment can give you that.

Industry is better. More seriousness, more dividends and you tend to meet better
 people there.

But there is no rule.

Unless you do research from Stanford or MIT or Berkeley you may not
get the right
exposure I think.

But these days a lot of innovation, creativity and research happens in
the open source
world. Not in any of the top univs.

The bazaar proved a success leaving the temples of education behind.

I am from a good college but I am no IITian.

One gets a lot of great ideas but any great idea be it a product idea
or whatever
else you are talking about needs a lot of time and whetting out to attain
fruition.

Most of our ideas appear great ab initio but turn out to be disasters later.

It is very likely that your current focus areas are totally off the mark.

Over time you will learn that an idea has to possess your being to quote Swami
Vivekananda.

"It should enter every pore of the body, become your nerve, blood vessels and
pulsate in every tissue."

Sorry if I misquote this great saint.

That is the idea. Unless you have such a strong resolve success is very hard.

I had a burning desire to start a company in 2000. Even now I have not
succeeded.

Your goal is not so big but still you need to know how strongly the idea has
entered your system.

You should not change your mind even if the entire world is against you. Most
people cannot even survive a storm. ;)

I disagree.

I had two years of experience working in the best company in India at that time.

I had got into it through campus.

You don't have such credentials yet. Your thinking right now cannot
give you right
answers as you don't have exposure/experience yet.

So first do the best in your circumstances and take up a job in the
favorite area, say
PHP.

That is important.

Lot of boys I meet don't know which area to embrace. One should know
that clearly.

Take my case. I have stuck to UNIX for the past 14 years and still going strong.

In your situation you have that choice. There are companies working on
every domain
 you can imagine in Chennai and Bangalore.

But no company can give you a career. They can only give you a job.

You have to build a career over 10 years.

Best of luck and May God shower you with blessings!

Your brother,
Girish

Check the time of my previous email. I replied just after checking. I
still get the same blank page though both th time page source shows
the same as what you posted.

Dear Friends

Brief intro befor coming to question

I am part of vast majority of this group ( silient spectators ) ,  made a
few posts although not from this mail id .

been a unix ,perl ,cms  developer for most of my career , now I am involed
as lead deveoper for one of  largest banking sites.

My client is worried that someone will hack into their new site ( banking
site ,security integerity etc etc )

Even though we carried out a penetration test by a specialist team from
Argentina and Isreal there is really nothing in the report except known
vulnarabilites like sql injection ,cross script attack and how to prevent
them , would have been happy if they were identified. Basically a crap
report running into thousands of pages virtually meaningless/Even after the
report came out he (client ) was asking me to try to break into the
application.



Mostly there can be only 2 ways to hack into a system ( correct me if I am
wrong )

1)      Basically the system admin is an idiot or

2)      Some thusfar unknown vulnarabilty which is exploited



Most of us would be fascinated if someone says they hacked into something (
Ankit fadia ) , atleast eager to find out what they did,which they probably
will never tell or nothing might have happenned ( like tcs.com hack in
techcrunch )

Every often we can read in newspapers about hacking festivals in colleges
where something was hacked in under X hours and prizes distributed by Mr X (
I wish this is as simple )



 Enough background ,now the question

1)      I want to setup a server where commonly used tools will be available
( a simple linux box with apache + one DB + one cms + what ever the machine
config can support ), users will get appropriate access including shell +
whatever , even root if that?s required.

2)      Users can freely  experiment without any fear of anything ( no fear
of internals for students & no legal action whatsoever. This is a outright
promise

3)      Subject to small fee ( not for profitabilty but for maintanence ) ,
collecting fee may not be a good idea afterall /Any sponsors for servers &
bandwidth?



4)      Anyone who are really sucessful  in their experiments must be
willing to share their experiences , anonymously also welcome.



5)      T&C to be decided and agreed







Do you think this a good enough idea to be implemented ?

+usual disclaimer as my cats have apprently learned  to type I am in no way
responsible for anything including content of this email and any flame war
that might happen . Nor my employer has any relation to this mail . this
mail is in good faith and is meant to help students and programming

1. this mail does not belong on this list - we as a community believe that 
security is a process best served by open sourcing the software.

2. further we as a community of hackers feel insulted that we are confused 
with crackers

3. and finally we believe that the only effective way to test proprietary 
software is to hire a million monkeys and put them on a million keyboards, and 
we wish to assure you that there are no monkeys available on this list.

Moreover in the Indian bandwidth constrained environment these Windoze
tools won't work properly.

Incredibly slow and useless.

Whereas ssh is ASCII. So highly usable and meaningful.

'at' is a one time deal.  It is fine if you want your machine to
shutdown at a specific time.  I also use it to _start_ the download of
iso or big package files after midnight but what about shutting down
the machine after the download is complete?  It is not deterministic
therefore you need to monitor the no. of TCP connections on your
system at regular intervals.  IMO, cron is the best option.

Oops. This thread is getting a bit tedious.

Let us move on.

The idea is never to cron this reboot business. I run the script I sent
only when I feel like it. Not always. So it is one shot like at(1).

So at(1) is a good tool to use for this purpose too.

I was about to respond if it is just turning off the system why not use
'shutdown +300' which does the same as above. But thought of checking
the diff between shutdown and poweroff. I looks like shutdown does
things more gracefully than poweroff. But shutdown does not switch off
the machine, if you want shutdown to do so you need to use -P.

net4india thinks that ilugc mail is spam and is bouncing it to

Try wget with logs enabled. Then check what do the logs have to say.

Hi,

I want to know where can I find the logs of the user space boot scripts.
I'm not looking for the kernel logs, instead I need the output of all
the daemons
that start during system startup.

I'm using CentOS 5.4.

You are not the first guy to ask this I am sure. ;)

I dunno the answer. I have myself wanted it.

I don't know if it is possible in any OS.

You only get kernel messages in dmesg.

One possibility is pressing the break key while booting...

Hi all,

I'm representing ThoughtWorks[1] developers from Chennai. We are
planning to host a BarCamp style unconference specifically targeting
the developer community called the DevCamp[2]. This will be first time
a DevCamp is hosted in Chennai (to our knowledge). The tentative date
is set to July, 10 - 2010. ThoughtWorks is willing to sponsor the
space to host the event and the much needed WiFi connectivity. The
registration and participation is free of cost.

We as developers want to stay true to the spirit of DevCamp and we're
reaching out to you - the Chennai developer community for organizing
and coordinating the event (right from creating a logo for the event,
a twitter account etc.,) and making it a success. There is a wiki[3]
page setup for more information.

If you have an idea to give a session/presentation or willing to
volunteer to organize the event please reply to this mail and join the
wiki[3] and subscribe to the Google group[4] for general announcements
and discussions.

We want this to be a (un)conference of some of the best developers and
hackers in and around Chennai with your help and support.

Thanks,
Balaji

[1] - http://www.thoughtworks.com
[2] - unconference is a participant driven conference, where right
from the choice of sessions to schedule of the sessions is driven by
the participants and not through a central body of 'organizers'.

Well, on googling I found that the daemon bootlogd can do what I wanted.
but the information online is debian specific.

When I was building bots I got different components from different places -
and this seemed to be the only place where I could get a particular servo
motor that I required. I don't know how it is these days but they were based
in IIT Bombay and would ship it to one's address and do a good job of it.
This was 2-3 years ago.

It's worth checking out in any case.

HTH :)

Cheers,

Hi ilugcies,
         I recently googled about Linux usage statistics all over the world
and found some information on that but the information shows only 1% use of
Linux globally in desktop market, is this wiki article is fake or real.And i
also found in some websites that Linux market share is high and w3c's
statistics is also wrong.So,please comment on this or we have to analyze the

Actually at the desktop level, linux usage is very meagre..  but at the
server level, its very popular and widely used..

However, with introduction of sharepoint 2010, everyone is moving to .NET
and windows based development..  In my company (which is a fastest growing
MNC), most intranet sites are developed in .NET and recently, new sites are
consolidated under sharepoint..

I think, Microsoft will have a big push through Sharepoint, just like it had
when it released windows GUI desktop..

Another thing is that Network integration is veyr powerful in Windows..
Most big corporates are moving on to Single Sign on, and Linux has been
having major problems in integrating to windows network..  We run a
corporate blogging site in linux, and its really a problem implementing
single sign on..

Its really an ambiguity to predict where will Linux Move on, unless it sorts
out desktop issues.

Senthil

Huh?  AFAIK, Windows 95 lifted the TCP/IP stack from *BSD.  OK, let's
accept it at face value; can Windows mount a NFS or for that matter
any other global file system w/o any additional software/driver?

You mean MS-ADS?   SSO (LDAP + Kerberso) was there much before MS-ADS
came out in Windows 2000.  Windows NT domain controller on paper looks
like NIS concepts.   MS-ADS is LDAP + Kerberos plus their
**proprietary** extensions to *open* standards which makes MS-ADS a
non standard.    To implement the proprietary extensions one has to
sign a NDA with MS - which means any FOSS solution will not be able to
implement them because of it's own licensing terms.  Samba4 is making
progress in implementing a clean room version of MS-ADS features but
it is not yet ready  for production use.

> We run a

Please see above.  Implement an open standard SSO and you should not
have the problem you are talking about.

At the end of the day it is the corporations prerogative to choose
it's platforms but to blame FOSS for not playing well with MS-ADS ....

> Its really an ambiguity to predict where will Linux Move on, unless it sorts

Please name a few issues.    IMO, for task workers (limited
functionality Office, Browser) it is already there.   I assure you
that large Indian MNCs are actively looking at Linux desktop (thin
clients) as an alternative for their aging desktop replacement.  In
desktop migration, I generally suggest to keep a few windows desktops
for their power users (especially Excel) - typically they are less
than 5% of their staff.

My 10 paise.

Good point.

Network integration being powerful in Windows?

You mean Windows shares? That is quite amazing given that it is
incredibly noisy
at the network level. Still its GUI is really intuitive and very
useful and friendly
end of the day.

You can share anything and their discovery protocols work very well.

I don't think UNIX NFS protocols ever attempted anything like
automatic discovery.

There used to be a protocol called SLP(Service Location Protocol) but
I don't think
it was adopted. I am talking about my Novell days. In fact Novell had
an interest in it.

Samba4?

Yeah it is slowly and surely getting stable.

In fact Samba is an incredibly well funded open source initiative. It
is unfortunate it is GPL.

As to single sign on I am sure LDAP existed for a very long time
though a good implementation is lacking.

SSO never took on in the UNIX for some reason. Even NIS does not seem
very popular.

People love Windows shares and Samba.

I agree that there are no single sign on solutions. Password syncing

Well blaming is one thing.

But Linux has no mandate to interoperate with Windows.

It is more or less a fact that Linux cannot capture the desktop market.

But of late I find a lot of penetration as rightly pointed out. Thin
client and cost
savings. And of course the virus menace.

I agree that the GNOME desktop is quite idiot friendly.

Windows users will only be slightly uncomfortable with it.

I don't hate Microsoft as some of their innovations are noteworthy and their
 ability to survive and sustain the market is itself quite creditable.

I don't like any commercial thing be it M$ or Cisco.

Even after all this days open source continues to appeal only to the
intelligentsia.

How so?  None of the Samba developers would be working on the project if
it was not GPL.  They were the earliest adopters of GPLv3 as well.   If
it was a permissive license, it would have definitely been forked with
several proprietary variants.

Hi All,

Recently I moved to Singapore and will be in frequent travelling for
next few months. So it is bit difficult for me to physically
co-ordinate the ILUGC activities. I am looking for someone to takeover
the ILUGC co-ordinator responsibility from me. Interested person,
please mail to me or the list.

Co-Ordinators Responsibilities:
1. Regularly conducting the monthly meetings.
2. Maintain the harmony in the mailing list.
3. Willingness to coordinate any LUG related activities.

Around 7 years and 7 months before, on Fri 11th Oct 2002, I took[1]
the responsibility of ILUGC Office boy aka Co-ordinator from Dr
Prabhu. Now it is a time for an another change :)

please do not spread FUD. There is no harm if you want to use GPL - but to 
spread nonsense that 'if it was a permissive license it would have ...'. Like 
python, perl, php, postgresql, zope, django, etc etc etc. You just need to 
look at one of your own distros to find the plethora of non-GPL packages there.

Please take a look at Apache Directory Server.
http://directory.apache.org/

Some documentation on interoperability on Windows, Linux etc with
documentation on how to set it up:
https://cwiki.apache.org/DIRxINTEROP/

If you prefer a more "enterprisy" (read as expensive), try out the Oracle
Identity Management solutions.
http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/id_mgmt/index.html

Or Novell:
http://www.novell.com/products/identitymanager/

Or Quest:
http://www.quest.com/identity-management/

I will be very surprised if none of these solutions can address your
requirement.

To the person who posted this question originally senthilraja P
<technocraze@gmail.com>:

The only reason your company is able to move to Sharepoint wholesale is
perhaps because your company has a homogeneous computing environment using
just windows. If you had sufficient numbers of Solaris servers, IBM
mainframes, Apple Macs etc, then you would have to consider a solution
which is based on more open standards.

With the new gadgets such as iphone, android phones, blackberry etc all
with wifi capabilities, you will really need to look at a solution which
isn't so tied down to windows.

There are some really good reason why Linux isn't taking off more on the
desktop, but SSO and identity management isn't the killer feature missing
on Linux which is causing Linux not to grow in the enterprise as much as
it should.

Thank you,

Why this occasion, we cant give this chance to the  students, I like to
introduce one of the active GNU/Linux user and the member of ILUGC Algu
Nambi Welkin, known as "beware
cat" in the list.

Who he is? & Why I am proposing him?
He is a 3rd year Engg. student, active member of ILGUC  who is also more
active with FSFTN in recent times.  A fedora contributor. Who promotes the
usage of F/OSS among his friend and his college.  He started LUG in his
college & running it successfully.


I believe this is better to give the chance to the students who is ready to
take it up. Here by I propose Algu Nambi Welkin for the coordinator.

If any students interested, please feel free to write to the list.

My Kind suggestion::

Collect/open the nominees those who are interested. 
Create an Poll tool in ILUGC site.
Send the invitation to participate for all the ILUGC members. 
Select based on the votes.

If at all there is going to be a poll (I guess there will not be one),
it should be held during the next meet (voting right only to those
present).

There are few pool tools will create the unique tokens for every mail IDs. The token can be expired after the time duration. But I feared that, the time consumption is more for manual inputs(mail IDs).

????? ??????? ???. 

Successor identification is one among the core responsibilities, of a good 
Leader.

Having mingled will all of us, for such a long time, Barathi can nominate one 
as his successor, based on who stood with time when it mattered most, during 
the tough times of ILUGC. 

??? ??? ???????????????? ?????????? ???? ??????? ????????????? spark ?? ?????????????? ??????????.

If that guy is is willing to accept the offer, we all should agree.

Hi everyone,

First of all thanks for the supporters.

If community selects me, Ill do my best to make ILUG-C an active and more
collaborative community.

My kind suggestion would be to include student(any willing student) along
with a experienced person for co-ordination, which would increase the students interaction and physical volunteers support from the students side for our events, which our ILUG-C lacks.



Thank you,

Alagunambi Welkin

Dear All,

I vote for Alagunambi Welkin (Now entering Final year Engineering in CSE),
since he has been very active for more than a year in promoting FOSS
activities in many institutions across Tamilnadu as a *physical
volunteer*and also co-ordinating with our ILUG-C members.

I am sure that, if Welkin is selected for co-ordinating ILUG-C activities,
he might show more involvement in promoting FOSS activities among students
community.

Apart from co-ordinating ILUG-C activities, he would also co-ordinate/work
with other existing FOSS communities like FSFTN, Swecha and keep maintaining
good relationship among the communities.

+1 Welkin

that is the correct way of doing things. Outgoing coordinator should get 
opinions from every one and then make a decision. And no stupid polls please - 
this is a LUG not a political party.

I believe that it depends upon the attitude of the people because during
past one month my windows xp is corrupted,but  I was using  dual booted
Windows and Ubuntu super os.And on that time  my brother and his friends
were using Ubuntu super os only but now even though  after installing
windows xp they prefer to work only in ubuntu and i asked them why they like
ubuntu just told that they are comfortable with ubuntu because they can
install even windows games [nfs,gta etc,.] in ubuntu and ubuntu super os
comes with default support for all media types and also bundles with famous
media players like VLC,Real  Player etc.And too games and special graphical
effects[like compiz,beryl,awn etc,.] which was amazed by most of my friends
too..

And even student of 5th grade in delhi public school learn Linux and  in
Bangalore through ambedkar slum computing center the slum children [mostly
they are low educated] learn Linux and using gimp for drawing art and
optimizing their photography.

Subject: [OLPC India] Marathi Primary school ebooks available for XO laptop
To: "india@lists.laptop.org" <India@lists.laptop.org>


Hello all,

It is my pleasure to make available Marathi Primary School ebooks for the XO
laptop for children in India,
http://olpc.pumba-online.com

I wrote to the Maharashtra State Govt Education Secretary informing him
about this project - just to be clear about copyrights etc. I have not heard
from anyone so I assume that there is no objection.

I would like to thank the following folks:

   - Soundar from Chennai for his fantastic continuing voluntary
   contribution in helping to scan these books.
   - My wife, Harshada for designing the HTML layout, images/thumbnails for
   the Marathi ebooks.
   - Alumni of PUMBA (Pune University MBA) for sponsoring the Marathi ebooks
   project. The localized educational content project wiki is being hosted on
   their website.
   - Various OLPC India volunteers for their inputs.

Work is underway to procure Hindi textbooks and Kannada textbooks. We need
volunteers to help with this and for other languages.
The ebooks are being released under Creative Commons so that they can be
used by others to build on top of it.

It would be great if few of you can test the books. After downloading on XO,
open the Browser. On left navigation, under Other, you will see link to the
ebooks.

After testing, it would be great to have volunteers help to pass these
ebooks to the school in
Khairat<http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_India/Khairat_Chronicle>where
real students can use them on their XO.

cheers,

Harshal

I agree with this. ILUGC co-ordinator is neither a paid job nor  powerful one. So there is no point in elaborate rituals of election.

Once the HTTP connection/TCP connection closes down due to its
intrinsic timeout you can remove the session.

Once the system shuts down or closes the browser, this is what
will happen.

Th exact semantics I dunno. Obviously the connection to postgres also
will close because this is made from your server to its local DB.

Hi,

Having known Bharathi and LUG for a decently long time, and having 
worked along side T.Shrinivas on a lot of occasion as a physical 
volunteer for LUG, I would give a +1 vote for him. On a lot of occasion 
when we direly needed human help he has come forward and given a strong 
helping hand. He has also proved himself by grooming Kanchi LUG to be an 
active and vibrant community. IMHO, he is the right person to fit into 
the shoes of Bharathi, as Raman has declared himself out of the race.

Just to remind, LUG coordinators have always kept a very low profile but 
have commanded the respect of the LUG by their dedication and 
involvement in leading and organizing LUG activities.

I m in little bit confusion, why can't we have one as co-ordinator and other
as sub-coordinator. I don't know how this idea will be but what I feel that
we need an experience person who has enough knowledge and is participating
in FOSS from long time but if due to any reason he is not available, the
sub-coordinator can take the responsibility.

As a co-ordinator I vote for Mr. Srinivasan T and as sub-coordinator I vote
for Mr. Nambi Welkin.

Its okie in the past, but why cant we have two roles now. In absence of one
let the other one takes his charge.

This is my thought :
AFAIK, ilugc as such is not like a corporate body with finite organisation
structure.
The role of sub co-ordinator is always a make shift arrangement, and this
role can be named when it is needed.
Hypothetically, if the sub-co ordinator is also absent, can we have a deputy
sub co ordinator?.

The present ILUGC structure (or lack of it) is the simplest and still working setup. Let us not complicate/formalise it further. 

Every member should consider himself/herself as co-ordinator/sub co-ordinator/deputy co-ordinator ...  and work for FOSS. Adding more persons as officials may create groupism which is not there at present.

We believe we had enough discussion on this thread. I hope its time to take
a call on this.

@ Bharathi/Raman, lets officially declare the our coordinator, since Srini
leads the opinion poll, why cant we announce him as the coordinator of the
list, drawing an logical conclusion to this thread right here.

We appreciate the comments from other lug members if any.

I like to convey my warm greetings to Srini.

@Srini, the very first thing what I like to remember you is FOSSCONF 2010.
Lets plan it with the lug  and make it happen in ASAP.


thanks & good wishes.

Dear All,

Based on the list discussion and personal response from our members, I
am happy to announce Mr Srinivasan T as the new Office Boy aka
Co-Ordinator of the ILUGC. On behalf of all, Congratulations to
TSrini. From now on TSrini will decide the meeting date, location and
make necessary arrangements. I have some ILUGC money, which is around
Rs 15K+. I will round it of to Rs 17500 and transfer to TSrini.

I will continue to be here in the list as a virtual member and hold
partial control over the mailman spam filter rules.

Bye :)

I used .net for 2 years during my diploma education, I created three
projects on it, I worked visual studio 2003 and 2005 but what I can say that
it is good when u want to create a small application, actually it is buggy
and waste according to my opinion, where programmer will not be using there
brain.
If I want to create an collaboration application or an application server,
should I use .net?
I think, the answer is no...its the java or python which I should choose to
create such application.

I will continue this thread, sorry little busy now...

Most of the people I know think Linux is very difficult for a layman to
understand. They fear that after installing Linux they will not be able to
do the normal tasks they do with Windows and thus they prefer paying money
to Microsoft instead of even trying Linux.

Oh yes, one of them has still stuck with Ubuntu after I installed VLC
for her. So I did :)

Many don't have internet access, and apt offline is not the easiest
thing in the world for them to use. And even if they *do* have, they
seem to prefer something a web interface (ala download.com) rather
than Synaptic (which's problem is, I think, too many packages). I've
helped about 7 friends install Linux, and except 1 nobody has stuck
with it (even after getting multimedia to work)

Ubuntu Software Center is a step in the right direction. But the
problem is, once they're bitten by a bad experience, they are
extremely reluctant to try Linux again.

I personally faced this situation in more than one occasions.

Share your thoughts and ways to over come this. the window user's feel
disappointed once they don't the same set of pirated software's what they
user earlier in windows.

I hardly one two takes great struggle to over this they become long time
Linux users, rest simply wipe their disc and they moved back to earlier
state, happily feel that they are back to their window

I believe if you make them use Ubuntu/Fedora, the result will be the
same always. Normal users are bound to look for the same things they are
used to no matter what OS they use (Mac included). I believe if you wish
Windows users to migrate to Linux, the most user friendly distro I have
come across is definitely Linux Mint. Very user friendly and everything
is really simple to setup. And the best part? It has all multimedia
drivers built-in and is based on the solid platform of Ubuntu.

I have successfully migrated my wife as well as my brother to it. They
haven't looked back since :)

The latest is Linux Mint 9 - Isadora.

HTH.

Hi All,

Happy to see so many views on this topic.  I just shared my experiences over
the past few years.  the reality is that most MNC's have a centralised
authentication system, which unfortunately is MS AD.  the intranet sites may
be powered by Linux, and in such case, there is the necessity that Linux
server has to integrate with windows domain.

If that is possible, then i am sure, much of the intranet sites will be
powered using Linux rather than Windows, as it would greatly reduce
their Project and Account Cost for each manager.

There are few open source apache modules like mod_NTLM, mod_auth_kerb..  but
there is hell lot of problem in implementing those..

In my view, this should be a best case for taking it up as research project
by ME students, who really want to do programming at system level involving
cryptography etc..

Infact i used to say this to those students who ask me about final year
project..

On Linux as Desktop, we have to accept the reality that, how far linux has
evolved through ubuntu, it still lack the finesse of windows, which inspite
of its crashes, is ruling the roost..  what is that special thing that
windows has as edge over linux..

Is it possible for us to find it without locking ourseves to FOSS
ideology..  in my view, more than ideology, the purpose is important..  and
here our purpose is NOT to uphold FOSS, but to improve FOSS to match the
microsoft's feature set..  many of the FOSS softwares exceed microsoft based
products, but there are key areas where FOSS is really lacking..  Desktop is
one such thing..  we need to understand the strengths and weakness of FOSS
vs MS to give MS a tough fight

Regards,
Senthil

First option is to use a monitoring application like monit to check if
your mysql server is running.  Putting a robust monitoring system is
nearly always better than using a hacked together script.

Second option is to use Perl DBI and try connecting to the MySQL
instance.  You can extend this option by querying various DB parameters
to ensure that the server is running within tolerance limits.

Here are 3 comments on your Perl code:

quote:  my $status = `lsof -i | grep mysql | tr -s ' ' | cut -f 1 -d ' '`;

It's bad Perl style to rely on external apps like grep/tr/cut to
manipulate text.
Replace them with Perl's internal routines.  The Camel Book has details on
why this practice should be followed.



quote: my $logfile = 'file';
quote: open (LOGFILE, ">>$logfile");

You are writing to "file" in the current working directory from where
this script is invoked.  This is insecure code and vulnerable to the
following exploit:

1. attacker creates a sym link using "ln -s /etc/passwd ~/file"
2. Root does "cd ~attacker; /path/to/mysqlmon" will corrupt /etc/passwd

Solution is to use absolute path for $logfile, or better yet use syslog or
a proper logging module from CPAN.



Check return value of open() and other system calls.

Eg. open($fname) or die "Error opening $fname: $!".

Wow,
that's the comments, I am looking for. Let fix things this time.

I got into some issues, when I tried to use Perl DBI module. lets say when
you try to connect to the MySQL instance [server], if the server is already
down, then connection statement throws you the error and stops the script
execution.

Since I went for in lining the shell command with in the Perl script.

quote:  my $status = `lsof -i | grep mysql | tr -s ' ' | cut -f 1 -d ' '`;

let me try to fix it again. Thanks Raja.

Senthil, the parts which I disagree with you on is that MNC's universally
use MS AD. That hasn't been true in my experience. I am not disagreeing
that many MNC's do use MS AD, but not all do. What is true is that pretty
much all MNC's have a large number of servers running the new MS Server
OSs which are  actually quite good.

Creating an intranet which works across multiple operating systems is a
solved problem. There are a number of solutions to this problem from
Oracle, Novell, CA, IBM/Tivoli, Quest etc, however, the reason non-MS
solutions haven't been as successful is because it requires these
companies to buy solutions from a number of vendors and pay these vendors
(a LOT) to integrate these solutions across a number of different
products. In the case of MS, the solution is delivered along with the OS -
example: Sharepoint services with the MS Server OSs.. similarly SQL Server
+ IIS + Sharepoint + OS bundles.

That level of integration is simply not available on Linux or any other
platform. Oracle tried some of this with Solaris + Oracle bundles (costs a
bomb) and IBM with AIX + Lotus Notes + DB2 bundles (again costs a bomb),
Sun with their bundles (Solaris + Oracle + Glassfish + Sun ONE directory
services etc) but in all my years of running a company, I am yet to
receive a single call from  any company offering me to sell me these
non-MS bundles - while I receive a sales call from MS partners very often.

If you are looking for collaboration suites, there are products such as
Lotus Notes (shudder!!) which work across OSes but it is a real PAIN to
work with.. I hear that Sharepoint is rapidly approaching Lotus Notes' as
yet unreachable levels of horrible mess.

Talking about project management - there isn't a single Linux-based
solution which compares to MS Project. Also, there is simply no
alternative to MS Office on Linux - no, openoffice does NOT count. Also
for stuff such as graphic design (photoshop) or engineering design
(CAD/CAM), the Linux offerings pale in comparison to what is available on
Windows. That is another reason why people prefer working on Windows in
the enterprise.

But if you look at enterprises where access to MS Office, MS Project,
Autocad, Photoshop etc isn't needed for the staff, you will see a whole
plethora of OSes being used - Macs, Solaris boxes, Linux the odd SGI box
etc. Linux is very commonly used in simulations, defense establishments,
movie studios, labs etc.

But the administrator needs to set this up only once but they feel that
they don't need to bother with that because MS already offers stuff with
everything pre-configured.

And as stated previously, the lack of products on Linux (office, project
management software) of comparable quality will impede the deployment of
linux in those enterprises where such products are required.

Actually, the technology already exists.

I would say that if these trainers were able to provide a single
integrated linux-based solution for download using the best of breed
products out there, it would help tremendously.

I believe Linux is pretty solid and stable. I don't think that is what is
causing any problems with its adoption. I think the problem is with the
lack of apps and the integration of these apps as stated earlier.

again and again I see this FUD about LAMP. What is LAMP stack? originally the 
word was coined to cover Linux/Apache/Perl/Mysql. Now it stands for:
An operating system - linux, BSD etc
A webserver - apache, nginx, cherokee, lighty etc
A database - postgresql, sqllite, mysql etc
A scripting language - perl, python, ruby etc

Please be accurate in terminology

Script stops execution because you have not handled the case where
connect() fails.

Use:
my $dbh = DBI->connect(...) or mysendmail("Cannot connect to DB: " .
DBI->errstr);

It's good programming practice to always check the return values of your
system and function calls.


If you are running this script through cron/at then be truly lazy (it's one of
the virtues of a perl programmer right?) and don't bother with sendmail at all.
Any output on stderr will be automatically emailed by cron/at to the configured
email address.  Just use the regular warn/die calls in Perl and cron/at will
automatically take care of emailing them to your user.

here is the original article on LAMP:
http://onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2001/01/25/lamp.html

note that in 2001, other webservers like lighty, nginx etc and other rdbms 
like postgresql and sqllite were either not in existence or were just becoming 
popular - please do some research and do not just rely on wikipedia.

Of course, there are plenty of excellent open source variants for any of the

Great concept,  I still remember the coding guidelines that we had to
follow as a developer for embedded system  (local tel. switching
system) in a large MNC, w/o which your code would fail code inspection
and could not be submitted for integration; to name a few (a)
initialization of variables (especially pointers - C was the lang.) ,
(b) return error codes, (c) check error codes.  For testing, cases
were required to test boundary value conditions besides the "sunny"
day scenarios.

what you mean is irrelevant - use the term correctly - if you want, mention 
that you will be covering LAMP using linux, apache, mysql and php. I for 
example, conduct LAMP workshops using linux, nginx, python and postgresql.

LAMP workshops using linux, nginx, python and postgresql is *not* correct.
It is LNPP then.

LAMP stands for Linux, Apache HTTP, MySQL, Perl / PHP or may be Python

Message-ID: <AANLkTilMm2FpR6j1xJCcifM_f2gyA8nY5HRP3CsP48im@mail.gmail.com>

As per the article,
http://onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2001/01/25/lamp.html

the author says
"Of course, there are plenty of excellent open source variants for any of
the pieces of LAMP. Let the L stand for Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and
Darwin/Mac OS X, all of which are open source operating systems and all but
the latter have open source GUI layers. Let the M stand for MySQL and
PostGreSQL. Let the P stand for PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby."

It is the author assumption. its not what every one took it.

As per Wiki,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29

LAMP represents Linux (any flavour), Apache HTTP, MySQL, Perp / PHP / Python
(may be )

If wiki is not correct, please read this from IBM research
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/edu/wa-dw-wa-lamp-i.html

To keep it simple for the beginners, LAMP should represent as Linux, Apache
web server, MySQL. PHP / Perl

may be for advanced users, it can be a platform or stack or what ever.

but one should remember Linux is not OS. its just a Kernel. In that case,
LAMP abbreviation is not correct.

ps: Starting a different thread on what is LAMP.

did you check the date of the article? these people coined the word LAMP - 
later on people have mistaken. LAMP basically defines a 4 component stack.

You could assume it is Libre Application Management Platform :P

But I appreciate your ideals and drive to call it only GNU/Linux.

Ideally it should not matter - which leads me to the question, why do 
you want it? Either way, use this (window.onunload) with caution - 
nagging users not to close browser windows is generally considered bad 
form (unless you're warning users about unsaved data) and is a usability 
bug.

Vamsee.

I need this for the purpose of tracking user login and logout, if the user
clicks logout button then there is no problem, but if the browser get closed
or due to some bandwidth issues or if shutdown occurs, then i need to track
it.

We have too many Roshans in LUG now. ;)

Video based training is useful and incredibly insightful.

I have learnt many yoga poses mainly gymnastic in nature and the advanced ones
 from youtube.

It is wrong to do yoga without a qualified teacher but then with computers and
other forms of secular knowledge the best thing to do according to me is to
learn on one's own using videos but look at every source with healthy
scepticism.

Never believe anybody till you have tested it yourself practically.

I have written an article about creating screencasts using tools on UNIX like
ffmpeg and similar ones like istanbul and recordmydesktop.

http://aplawrence.com/Girish/gv-screencast.html

But I have not been able to do much on this later.

Videos are the best way to teach and learn, no doubt about it.

Forgot to mention the most awesome video websites: www.ted.com
There's too many great videos on TED to list here.


I also listen to Steve Gibson's Security Now podcasts:
    http://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm
Steve tends to rant a lot, but the episodes on SSL vulnerabilities,
cracking electronic voting machines, etc are a lot of fun to listen.


IT Conversations has great content as well:
    http://www.itconversations.com
Brewster Kahle's lecture titled Universal Access To All Knowledge
is exceptional:

Subject: [Ilugc] Beautiful way to upload a file using curl and FTP
Message-ID: <AANLkTikLjXriHuym096lDthlFco8jdd-ld-gfyTDqYK0@mail.gmail.com>

$ curl -T - ftp://ftpserver.somewhere.org/path/to/file.txt
<middle click with your mouse>
  Press enter or Ctrl-D or Ctrl-C

The file gets uploaded from stdin. Or even redirect like this.

$ curl -T - ftp://1.1.3.4/foo.txt < foo.txt

Of course this would work for HTTP GET or POST also but that would be
not very easy as FTP.

I have not tried it at least.

WebDAV aimed to making HTTP read/write but I don't think it was a big hit...

FTP still continues to rule the roost.

And we have many tools for that. curl, wget, lftp, ncftp and so on.

Aha. In which case, just use window.onunload event, and when it happens, 
check location.href. If it equals your logout page, it's a normal exit. 
Else, you need to report/log the error. Does that solve your problem?

Vamsee.

How well were they received? As a student myself, I've tried to get my
staff to use Academic Earth videos with absolutely no success. I even
downloaded them myself and gave them DVDs. Any suggestions on what I
can do to get my fellow students and faculty more interested?
