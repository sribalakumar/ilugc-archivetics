Wow,

I never knew one can be so ignorant to detail, especially the comment
on absence of a firewall, absence of FrontPage, Inability to buy
Norton. But had a nice laugh though. And there are people who think
Dreamweaver and Frontpage is all you ever need to build a web page. No
wonder the IT jobs are outsourced.

Thanks for the link guys.

Subject: [Ilugc] Sharing 2 or more ISP accounts....
Message-ID: <001501c66ce8$06447500$0100a8c0@dhana>

Hello everybody,

I am very much new to Linux and to the Networking,

I request every body in this list to help me to resolve my current problem

I have 2 different ISP (static IPs -  61.17.177.,,,,     and 61.17.190...... 
with 2 different Gateways) connections 256 KBPS Unlimited from VSNL

my LAN Setup is having 15 workstations, at present,

Let us say "Plan A"
configured 10 computers to First ISP

and "Plan B"
5 computers to the Second ISP.

Is it possible to have a single server (like proxy server) to have load 
balancing and fail over (redundancy between 2 ISPs), so that all the 15 
workstations are connected to the server to share the internet connection.

My problem is if ISP serving "Plan A", all the workstations in "Plan A" is 
re-configured to the ISP of the "Plan B"

So, to eliminate this and also to have the Load balance, I am in need of a 
"Solution".

Please note, All that 15 work stations will be accessing only one website at 
any point of time, and no other websites will be browsed using these 
Internet connection.

Please help me in implementing this solution, commercial terms are also 
welcomed.

Thanking you,

Sithi.

But she looks to be suffering from something like Paranoid Schizophrenia.

My suggestion is that , avoid any direct communication with her and don't
provoke her  just to make some fun. She may suddenly turn dangerous.

I use FC5 on inetl845-P4 machine, and my inernet connection is dataone. I
use Huawei WA1003A router. Often, URLs resolve as 1.0.0.0

[root@localhost ~]# apt-get update
0% [Connecting to apt.sw.be (1.0.0.0)] [Connecting to ayo.freshrpms.net (
1.0.0.0)] [Connecting to newrpms.sunsite.dk]

in irssi, when given the command /server irc.freenode.org, i got.

06:06 -!- Irssi: Looking up irc.freenode.org
06:06 -!- Irssi: Connecting to irc.freenode.org [1.0.0.0] port 6667

But if i use the ip directly it all goes ok. like when i say /server <ip
address of server>, it works fine.

These are just 2 examples. This kind of problem exists with many
applications. Is it some problem with the DNS server, or is there anything
that i need to change in my configuration?

That is weird. And you haven't posted the most important config file

That's your ADSL router, isn't it? I actually figured what could be
the problem - 1.0.0.0 is the IPv6 loopback address, :1, which suggests
your problem is IPv6 related. Disable IPv6 on both your Linux box
(can't see it enabled, though) and the router and give it a try.

Hi
 
My friend installed apache tomcat 5.5.1 in a system which has Windows XP with IIS running. Apache tomcat installation went on smoothly without any problem. While starting, apache stops half the way(http://localhost:8080). He googled and tried some of the suggestion including changeing the port ( to 81 etc)  without any success. He needs to open a *war file. Suggestion from the group is welcome. Thanks in advance.

I don't think so. It is a Linux group - LUG. Not an IOSSUG.

Anything running on Linux/interoperability with Linux/remotely
connected to Linux = OK. Else, not OK.

Dhanagopal, why don't you post your question(s) in Tomcat Usenet group. 
  You might get your question answered there.

Ctrl+Alt+F1 should (hopefully) put you in a terminal :)

Things were easy in Windows since it had (at least by default) only one 
window manager (Explorer).  I believe Ubuntu Live CD comes with GNOME by 
default, so it would be Alt+F1 for opening the GNOME Application Menu.

I don't know the equivalent for KDE, I've never used it.

But why don't you look into fixing the problem instead? Check whats the 
mouse device and protocol configured in XF86Config or xorg.conf.

PS.
Seriously, the subject you have used isn't much helpful for anybody 
who's searching for the same problem.

I have had this problem too - it turned out that the PS/2 mouse
connector on the mother board had a flaky contact.  I used a USB to PS/2
adapter to connect the PS/2 mouse and it solved the problem.

BTW, if your connectors and other hardware are in prime condition, then
there is a chance it could be a kernel or network issue. 
Some others too have reported similar problems with mouse misbehaviour:

<http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2005-02/0833.html>
If you are absolutely sure that you do not have any hardware issues,
take up the problem to one such linux kernel mailing list.

<Alt> + F1  shows the panel menu
<Alt> + F2  bring up the run application dialog
<Alt> + Tab  between windows

Now, that should help you open the control centre to change settings for
mouse and keyboard.  Find and set the "move pointer with keyboard (num
pad)" option to true, and you can move the mouse cursor with the
numpad.  More keyboard shortcuts are available either from the "key
board shortcuts" dialog or the application itself.

All works enter into the public domain after the statutory period
expires, but if an author desires to immediately place his work in the
public domain, it needs to be done under a license.

If you put it under any kind of license, its not public domain anymore.

yes - putting it in public domain means giving up the copyright. If you
give up the copyright, you no longer have any rights over the software and
hence dont have the right to license it

Ok.
It is alright if we do not have the right answers.
But it is important that we do have the right questions.

Debate is the way to find answers for subjective matters in mind. But If we
don't mind, then it doesn't matter.

I am looking for an affordable (50-60k) laptop, to be bought in
India. My initial choice of ThinkPad went off the roof when I
checked out the prices in India. Lenovo site says the R series
starts at 87k ! The feature to price ratio is too high - 40 Gb,
256 Mb, no DVD write and so on ...

So that goes out my my list - not really affordable :(

Then I checked out HP's stable and one model caught my eye,
The HP Compaq nx6125 Notebook PC (EX762PA):
http://h50025.www5.hp.com/hpcom/in_en/11_28_365_4175_EX762PA.html

AMD Turion 64 Mobile, 512 Mb, 80 Gb, Dual layer DVD writer, ...
at 58k (may go to 60k or so with taxes etc.)

Any of you had experience with this laptop ? Would you advise me
to go for it ? Would also like to have your alternative
recommendations ..

Note - the laptop is to be bought in India.

And yes - would also like to have your advice regarding trusted
dealers in Chennai :)

The IBM/Lenovo website is a total waste.  The online product
list is woefully incomplete... just ask any IBM reseller for a
product catalog and you'll be overwhelmed with the list of
Thinkpad models available locally.

I bought an R51 2887MQ8 (1.4GHz Celeron M, 512MB, 40GB,
DVDROM/CDRW, 14.1") kit yesterday for Rs. 38,250.  This is
not my primary PC, so DVDRW, etc. is not too critical for me.

I put in the order at 1pm and it was delivered to my door by 8pm
the same day.  By 10pm, I had Debian on it and am using it right
now.

Has anyone got any of the Reliance R-Connect pcmcia data cards
working in Linux?

Message-ID: <20060503100958.63561.qmail@web8404.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hi,

A kernel module loads when a usb device with my
VID/PID is attached. Now, this kernel module has to
pop-up another device instance so that the end user
sees the entry of two devices (although in reality, we
have only one VID/PID). I saw that this is possible in
windows. I was not able to find a similar design in
Linux. So far, I was not able to land on anything
related to this from Google. Has anyone encountered a
similar situation. Kindly guide me.

Thanks and Regards,
Joseph.

Your terminology is totally confusing me.

1. You can use lsusb to view the devices attached to
the USB bus.

2. You can use USBView written by Grek Kroah:

http://www.kroah.com/linux/usb/

http://www.kroah.com/linux/usb/usbview-screenshot-1.0.jpg

3. If you use Ubuntu, they have
System->Administration->Device Manager to view
devices.

BTW, in the Linux kernel, all device enumeration takes
place in usbcore.o (in 2.4) and usbcore.ko (in 2.6)
which are inside the kernel. So, your subject line is
always true, and its not possible in any other way in
Linux.

SK

... which tells me that you didn't attend the talk on
"USB and GNU/Linux - An Overview" ?

For all the discussions we have had with USB in this
mailing list, I'd expect you to be more specific. But,
that's just me.

Anyways, what USB drivers? Host-controller?
Class-drivers? Drivers for a USB hardware?
Audio/video/serial/mass storage/HID/bluetooth?

In India, under Section 30 of the Copyright Act, the owner of a
copyright may grant any interest in the right by license, and the author
has every right to grant his work to  public domain under a license.  It
is universally practised and well established by custom too. For
example, John Walker, the author and maintainer of http://fourmilab.ch/ 
who has contributed a number of Unix utilities and other articles has
the following text on his site:

    "Except for a few clearly-marked exceptions, all the material on
this site is in the public domain and
      may be used in any manner without permission, restriction,
attribution, or compensation."

That is a fine example of a simple license with clear terms, placing the
author's work in the public domain relinquishing copyright.  A
dedication may be made using more formal terms, like for instance under
the creative commons public domain dedication at
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/  or
http://www.gjt.org/doc/pd/statement.shtml or merely a short label that
the author has placed his work in the public domain.

A copyright license given you by is a authorization for others to use
your otherwise proprietary copyrighted content. Disowning all such
rights puts your work under public domain. There is no such thing as a
license under public domain. Only public domain declaration or
dedications

Some detailed information

An example of such a declaration:
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/ 

A usage of it

This might be considered a license because it has exceptions which is
not under public domain.

Hi All,

Can we write/run  a sample  block driver module without having a block

If yes, can someone  give me a pointer or source for sample code.

Take a look at the RAM disk driver in the kernel.  You should find it
in the kernel source in drivers/block/rd.c.

When you are done with that, have a look at the loop back driver. It
lives in drivers/block/loop.c.

Hi Saha,

Not a direct answer to your query, but you may want to wait until
the end of the year. There's likely to good availability of dual-core
notebooks with Yonah, Merom and Turion X2 CPUs then, at
price-points similar to single-core notebooks now.

I assume you mean this:

http://ronja.twibright.com/

My 2c:

Line-of-sight optical communication through free air has been around for
a long time (~40 years) - but it has a number of serious disadvantages:

1) Precision engineering, accurate alignment and collimation required.
2) Beam interruptions due to intervening objects like birds, leaves, etc.
3) Vagaries of weather, etc.
4) Range limitation due to atmospheric scattering.

With the arrival of low-cost RF WLAN technologies like Wi-Fi, etc., which
do not have these disadvantages, line-of-sight optical is essentially
obsolete. The same effect is easily obtained at lower cost using WiFi
and high-gain directional antennae. You can easily modify a stock
Linksys WRT54G or similar wireless router to set up point-to-point
RF links.

public domain is not mentioned in section 30. Public domain means that no
one has copyright. section 30 deals with licenses granted by holders of
copyright. Reliquishing copyright is dealt with in section 21. I an author
relinqueshes his copyright (gives it up), the software belongs to public
domain

not so - part of it is in public domain and some exceptions are released
under license. You cannot grant a license for something you do not own.

This is not a license - it is a relinquishment

I am afraid, it would be difficult to cure your confusion, but I would
give it a last try.  Anyway, I hope it encourages authors here to place
their works in the public domain, using any of the following mechanisms
appealing to them.

Now, like I said earlier, the author may make a unilateral public domain
declaration, which could be traced to the enabling provisions under
Section 30 of the Copyright Act, which gives authors the right to make
grants as they please.  Copyright vests easily upon original works by
authors without cumbersome registration, and it could be relinquished
just as easily by a simple public domain release license.

If the above step is totally unacceptable to someone, then there are
others provisions that come to the rescue of authors eager to place
their works in the public domain.

The author may assign the work in favour of the government, and in most
jurisdictions that automatically places the work in public domain. 
Government funded projects are often treated as public domain works,
like for instance, in the US.  But note that in India,  Government works
usually enjoy copyright for 60 years unless it is explicitly otherwise
granted, and so one may have to include clear terms in the assignment
placing the work in public domain with immediate effect.

That apart, authors may also relinquish all or any or their rights under
Section 21 of the Copyright Act which provides:
<quote>
21.  Right of author to relinquish copyright.-
(1) The author of a work may relinquish all or any of the rights
comprised in the copyright in the work by giving notice in the
prescribed form to the Registrar of Copyrights and threupon such rights
shall, subject to the provisions of sub-section (3), cease to exist from
the date of the notice.
(2)  On receipt of a notice under sub-section (1), the Registrar of
Copyrights shall cause it to be published in the Official Gazette and in
such other manner as he may deem fit.
(3)  The relinquishment of all or any of the rights comprised in the
copyright in a work shall not affect any rights subsisting in favour of
any person on the date of the notice referred to in sub-section (1).
</quote>

However quaint and old fashioned, Section 21, framed in the era without
internet where the public could never instantly access works of authors,
could still be pressed into service to bring in works to public domain
after notice to the Registrar and publication in the Official Gazette. 
A "relinquishment" of  "all or any of the rights" under Section 21 is
perhaps not exactly the same as making a "public domain declaration"
under Section 30 of the Copyright Act,  but it makes no much difference
to the public as long as there is a legally valid dedication.

Red Hat Scholarships is the first ever open source program of its kind
in the world designed to encourage young talent and spread the open
source philosophy that has created world class software like Linux,
Apache and many other programs.

Open Source is a philosophy that is based on collaboration, community
and the collective ownership of intellectual property. Under the Red Hat
Scholarships program, we aim to connect students with mentors from the
world of open source software so that they get practical exposure in
software development. The challenges outlined under this program are
based on practical, real-life problems that are of importance to the
global open source community. The experience of participating in Red Hat
Scholarships will therefore help the students when they graduate and
become part of the information technology industry.

This is the third consecutive year that the Red Hat Scholarships program
is being run. This program will be a recurring, annual event. Under this
program, awards worth Rs 10 lakhs will be distributed to the winning teams.

To participate in the program, students will have to develop a piece of
high quality open source software. The projects submitted to Red Hat
Scholarships are expected to have effort contribution similar to that of
a typical final year BE/BTech project. Group projects are admissible
provided a group does not consist of more than five students, each
student of the group has identifiable contributions, and the total
visible effort is commensurate with the number of students in the group.
In the event of a group winning the scholarship, the scholarship amount
will be divided equally amongst all group members. In addition deserving
participants would be offered national and international internships
with Red Hat.

So this is your chance ! Participate in Red Hat Scholarships.

he is not confused - he is 100% right -  so there is nothing to cure.
Simple, license of a copyrighted work and relinguishment of copyright are
two totally different things. It is the latter that leads to a work
getting put into the public domain

the public proxies available do not support CONNECT. so u r out of
luck. u might be able to use IRC directly if you have an account on a
department machine which has a direct connection. otherwise, the way
out is to use an external service like your-freedom.net over the HTTP
proxy.

Apologies for the confsuion. When a usb device comes
in, the kernel module will be loaded as per the normal
usb identification technique (i.e, in 2.6, udev finds
the module, loads it). At this point, I need to pop a
child device instance from this loaded kernel module.
The situation arises for me in this case. When SCM's
SDI010(SCR331-DI) is connected in winXP, although a
single device is connected, to a user, two devices are
enumerated and displayed. I need this implementation
in Linux. Here, pcsc-lite searches the usb bus for new
device arrival and loads the corresponding bundle. So,
I need to inform pcsc-lite about the second device
also. Here, I am stuck.

Thanks 
Joseph

U can configure it as a imPS/2 mouse, i.e. intelli mouse. I too have a
Logitech PS/2. It is also similari to yours, optical,...
After making it imps/2 even scroll works well.

I am guessing that you haven't yet read the USB
specification.

1. single device != two devices. Or, you are again
using some incorrect terminology. 

2. AFAIK The USB specification doesn't say anything of
this sort.

Thanks ! I enquired with the dealer and got this information
regarding Lenovo ? Notebook ? R 51 Model 2887 ? MQ6 :

Intel Centrino (1.7 GHz, 1 MB Cache)
512 MB DDR RAM
80 GB HDD
15 "TFT Monitor
DVD Writer
Ultra NAV/ Integrated VRAM
Wireless Antenna & Wireless Card
Built in microphone
10/100 Ethernet
56 Kbps Modem
IBM Carry Case
Battery backup ? Up to 3 ? 4 Hours
1 Year CCI IBM Warranty

This comes with a price tag of Rs. 57,400. Sounds good for a
ThinkPad :)

Hmm... I'm curious how some of the USB devices I see in the stores
here are handled, then. They are dual-purpose - for example, a USB
flash drive + a wireless mouse. If you plug one of these into the
computer's USB port, two devices are detected - a mouse ("Human
Interface Device") and a drive ("Extenal Mass Storage").

Hi List,

You should maintain the session at the server and have the session time-out
at the server if there has been no activity from the client for more than 60
secs (pretty low, I feel!).

I have captured ethereal data from such design and found a few info

HTTP is a stateless protocol. So you cannot achieve this by configuring a
http server. You need to use a session handling module (perhaps written in
PHP/PERL/Python/Ruby/etc) which will do this for you.

Hope this helps.

This is strange. Possibly the battery is weak, but in that case, the clock
will only run slow by a few hours a day. Any way you can change the battery
& try. Mostly the battery model will be  CR2032. It will be available in any
shop.

I second this.  I got a horrible carry-case that I'm just going to

If the design is not too important and a central server is ok, any wiki
software might be a choice or there are collaborative text editors like
gobby.

wiki could be too unstructured - version control, access control is
difficult. Was thinking more in terms of things like silva and docbook. I
have used these, but as a single user. I am interested in practical
experiences with multiple authors of differing skill levels

I'm pretty happy with an acer travelmate .. sleek, light aluminium and 
plastic shell.  a bit cheaper - slightly lighter

and dont bother with the carry case a laptop manufacturer bundles - 
theyre always junk. a good caselogic case will only set you back another 
2k or so, tops - far lighter, sleeker.  Those are made in hong kong, you 
can buy them at witco etc.

<commercial>I got a more or less like new caselogic - anybody wants it

Not necessarily. Moinmoin has been working well for Fedora and we do use
version controls+ACL's minimally on them. Document workflow in plone
+zwiki is pretty good too.

We are still evaluating solutions but wiki as a scratch pad and
collaborative work tool has been useful for the release notes and some
of the documents.  The primary advantage being lowering the barrier to
entry. Disadvantage being tools to process content which is avoiding by
conversions. It can be converted into docbook (many wiki implementations
have plugins/converters) for processing and publishing later.

Ohh! These are called "composite" or
"multi-functional" devices [1]. I am not sure if this
is what Joseph was refering to or which distribution,
specific kernel version he is using.

For any device in USB you have descriptors that
describe the characteristics of a device. They follow
this hierarchy:

 device descriptor
        |
 config descriptor
        |
interface descriptor
        |
endpoint descriptor

So a multi-functional device has many interfaces to
it. For example, you can have a USB VOIP phone that
also has a mass storage interface. Each interface has
endpoints that has buffers to which data is
sent/received.

The endpoint is analogous to the concept of "ports" in
your TCP/IP stack. To identify a unique application on
a system across a network, you specify the IP
address:port number, for example, 192.168.10.1:80.

Similarily, in USB you have a device address and its
endpoint number. For a multi-functional device, both
the interfaces should have the same device address (it
is still only one device), but many endpoints.

When you plugin such a device, enumeration will happen
only once for the single device. All details of the
device, configuration, interfaces, endpoints are
obtained by the host from the device. The usbcore
module will claim the appropriate interface drivers,
in your example, HID (mouse) and mass storage (flash
drive).

If you have multiple partitions in a flash drive, they
get detected as /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2 etc, which you
can automount with udev for the end-user. Similarily,
corresponding device files should be detected for a
multi-functional device.

I don't know if such devices are available in Chennai,
but, as per the USB specification and Linux USB
implementation, this should work.

HTH,

To be pedantically correct, you identify a network service via three
parameters - IP address, port and protocol. 192.168.10.1:80 could be
different applications on TCP and UDP, for example.

this sounds good - i am a big fan of moinmoin - but needed some feedback.
Will need some creative use of ACLs, but, most important, it lowers the
barrier

And all web apps are PHP powered.  Notice on the last slide the
author calls for PHP developers to join his company.

Request Tracker should have made it into the list.

All said, it's very difficult to do an unbiased "Top 50".  Maybe even
meaningless.  Just ask the person next to you for which linux
distro you should be using...

It is misleading to say authors cannot make grants to the public domain
under a simple license.  If an author places his work in the public
domain under a license invoking his right under Section 30, nothing
would be left to relinquish under  Section 21, which clearly saves the
prior license  under Section 21(3).  If the two are totally different
things, the saving would have been needless.  The BSD like licenses save
just credit for the authors and GPL like licenses exclude proprietary
caging of free code, but otherwise, the author simply dedicates his work
to public use using the licensing mechanism.  The author who publishes
with a license that says "this work is in the public domain" gives up
his copyright, and is a valid and lawful dedication.

Your confusion with how two totally different things could achive the
same object may easily be cured with this example.  It is like one could
read a file using more or less.  Though less is opposite of more, either
of them could be used to read files.  As long as you can read and
understand the contents, it hardly matters you used more or less.  A
license is a positive and simple grant, but a relinquishment is negative
and procedurally complex to implement in most jurisdictions.  The
shortest path to dedicating a work to public domain is under a simple
license.

Someone here pointed to http://www.wikipedia.org/public_domain  The
emerging case law in the US appears to make it further simple by
treating works of authors who widely disseminate their programs at free
exchanges as belonging to public domain.  The mere act of publishing the
work on the internet giving free access to the public could in itself be
easily treated as public domain dedication by the author, and I am glad
the law there is moving ahead in that direction.

Hi,

Let me tell you about my new Acer Travel Mate 2413

It has all the fetaures you are looking for
Celeron M  (1.5 GHZ), 256 RAM,DVD Writer,Wifi 802.11b/g,915 Chipset

All at surprising price of 35,000 K.I wasnt confident about it when I first
saw it.
But apart from that glassly look( because I dont personally like that) on
the outside, I love this desi product,
Its lighter than the 14'' Dell Inspiron,good performance( with Ubuntu
especially),1 year warranty and international support.

Does lack some features of harddisk protection,biometric security(as in Dell
and Thinkpad).I purchased the model only because I felt the components are
stable. Its better than my dad's 14'' Dell.

A new model from Acer is priced at 30,000k but the only difference is it
lacks DVD Writer but comes with Combo Drive.

But I will suggest you to look at the new Centrino Duo processor based
laptops,Centrino Duo is considered to be the
next generation high performance processor from Intel.

Note : Comes with Linux as the default Operating System.

I purchased it 2 months ago from one dealer in Vadapalani,

On that particular day I was only downloading mails. Is it possible to
teminate the TCP connections(any freeware?) that are are not initiated from
my machine?
I have not installed firewall, and Iam using windows 2000. Since the mail
downloading is getting slower and slower, plz mail me the links to
understand/solve this problem.


Thanks in advance,

uma.

The acers come with some random taiwanese linux as the default OS (much 
like some vendors sell a PC with just ms-dos or pc-dos installed to cut 
costs).  You're strongly encouraged to blow that away and install ubuntu 
or fc5.  In fact the dealer will quite probably offer to sell you a 
pirated XP to replace the "useless" OS on the box where nothing - 
wireless, etc, works.

Are you running some kind of p2p client?  Or are all these netbios 
probes etc just because your win2k PC is not updated at all, and so has 
a virus of some sort?

I'd suggest reformating your machine, installing win2k or xp (or better 
still, linux) and updating it all .. i am sure someone here can give you 
updates for whatever distro it is (fc5 etc) on cd so you dont have to 
download all the rpms or debs using a dialup.

please dont spout such bullshit on the list. sometimes there are simpler reasons
than evil motives. first off, CONNECT does work (correct me if i am wrong, but
https uses CONNECT?). it is just that we dont use nat but application level
proxying (for mostly historical reasons+). so, actually, neither irc nor cvs is
blocked. in fact, one can argue that actually nothing is blocked* - only, you
need to tunnel whatever you want over http. maybe, it is time to switch from
squid to nat, but this is not the forum for discussing that.

sriram

+ nat tools were not commonly available when we first got good connectivity.

* well, most of the proxies do use squidguard, so some urls like
http://www.playboy.com may be blocked.

Hello All,

To have  the compatability i have used  the macro CONFIG_X86_64 in

But this macro is only working in driver.
 
Can any one tell me what should i do to make my user space files compatable.
At present i am using a user defined macro and changing it (define/

Can i have common makefile for 2.4 and 2.6 driver module.
At present i am using 2 differnt makefiles and changing them when ever i

I think it  is a user  define macro.
If i use this,  again i need to #undef x86_64  every time i move to  a 
32 bit system
and is same what i am doing now.

Hi,

Follow this,

1) Go to www.your-freedom.net
2) Register a free account and download their java client.
3) Run the java client, enter your login details, and configure proxy to 
hproxy.iitm.ac.in and port 3128 (i'm assuming you're living in the hostel 
zone).
4) Select the bit which says "Supports CONNECT" (this will make the client 
connect to the third-party freedom server using connect on port 443 - 
which will be a lot faster than the usual method: simulating a constant 
connection by issuing POST requests at regular intervals).
5) Fire up your irc client, and set it up to use the SOCKS proxy running 
on 127.0.0.1 port 1080.
6) Say hello to the folks at freenode :)

Optionally, connect directly to the local insti irc server (which I run on 
my machine, and which currently has a grand total of *gasp* 12 users) on 
10.94.4.78, port 6667 (my nick's golu, if you want to chat).

Hope this helps,

1. Which kernel are you using?

2. Are you able to mount it manually (just to make
sure, it works)?

3. If you are using Linux 2.4, you can use /etc/fstab
for automounting. If you are using Linux 2.6, you can
use udev to automount.

Kernel compilation is very different from a user-space
programming in a GNU/Linux environment.

In kernel-space you have special gcc flags and you are
using the kernel header files.

In user-space programming, you will be using glibc,
mostly.

Well, you could. You have the freedom to. But, its
convenient to maintain separate Makefiles considering
all the rules you can have.

I want to assign some data to a long pointer variable SysAdddr.

#ifdef CONFIG_64
*(SysAddr + num_items) = (0xaa55aa55aa000000 + num_items);
#else
*(SysAddr + num_items) = (0x11220000 + (num_items));
#endif
If it is 64 but system i should assign 64 bit or else 32 bit data.
Can i have any other option/method ?

Thanks
Sudheer

Heh. This used to be the case at IITB too. Even the silliest old 286
in the corner used to have a routable IP, since NAT wasn't all that
popular, and the whole system depended on an edge firewall (Cisco
something, IIRC). There was a huge proxy for the whole of campus
(well, minus CSE students and all faculty members), which gave rise to
a lot of "hacks" - those could fill a book. :)

To the OP: Transconnect (http://transconnect.sourceforge.net) sounds
ideal for you. Give it a try. It supports authenticating proxies too.

Just out of curiosity I'm asking, what does the above "Expert in

FYI,

"
I was informed of this by folks from UNDP/APDIP at a 
conference in Bangkok earlier this week.

BBC will be running a two-part documentary on open
source called Code Breakers.

Part 1 is on Thursday May 11th at 0330hrs, 1730hrs,
and 2130 hrs SGT
Part 2 is on Thursday May 18th at 0330hrs, 1730hrs,
and 2130hrs SGT

I am told by reliable sources that Microsoft had
intervened in this documentary by making things
difficult for BBC. Let's see how it turns out.

A description of the show is at:
http://www.bbcworld.com/content/template_clickpage.asp?pageid=2783

And the schedule details at:
http://www.bbcworld.com/content/template_tvlistings_net.asp?pageid=668#start

Would be good if someone can record it.

Ops, getting to {OT} ... :-)

Anyway, to clarify the importance of "information searching skill" for 
an analyst:

1. "Information search" adds values to the analysis work,
2. "Reinventing the wheel" is not desired, we better know what exist & 
available and what NOT!!
3. Nevertheless, knowing "competitor's" solution/technology helps to get 
extra edge,

It just helps to find out required input [information] for "Decision 
Analysis Report" and "Feasibility study". It is only one part in 
analysis, other obvious part must be the hands-on lab work with domain 
knowledge.

There is no point one being master in these and i dont think you should keep
this as an option in your requirements section. There are more search sites
which give results better than google nowadays. So your analyst, if he knows
only google and google expert,he will not survive. These search techniques,
if the analyst is good, he would grab these in no time. So i would suggest
keeping this as a creteria would not help much.

Theres one quote about Einstein, when Einstein was asked "How many foot make
one inch", he said i dont know. People were shocked to hear this answer.
When asked to Einstein, he told "This information is available in every book
and it will take no time for me to take a book,refer and tell you the
answer".

India is the largest democracy in the world. The right to vote and
more importantly the exercise of franchise by the eligible citizens 
is at the  heart of every democracy. We, the people, through this 
exercise of our right to vote have the ultimate power to shape the 
destiny of country by  electing our representatives,  who run the 
Government and take decisions for the growth, development & benefit 
of all the citizens. So don't miss the opportunity.

Sorry, I couldn't resist...

Compare this to the Chennai media, which is _owned_ by the politicians.
Just observe the discrepancies reported by the various TV channels
during the election, especially the vote counting and results announcement.

Yeah. A  lot of people think that what big difference , my one one vote is
going to make.
All of us should remember that a Govt in India collapsed just because it
lacked one vote.
So, i also appeal to all, to apply your mind and memory, to analyse and
apprise all the things happened in the past & the things need to  happen in
the future , make a rational decision and implement the decision by voting.

+1.
This is unfortunate.
And very dangerous.
Out of the four pillars of democracy, two are already damaged ( or even
demolised) by the politicians. Unbiased/Unpressurised  Media - The Third
Pillar is also getting bent by push/pull pressures.
Really Scaring. If this allowed, the media will be slowly swallowed in full
by them, only to start bending the fourth pillar - The Judiciary.

I pray god for something constructive to happen to counter all these.

The legislature in India is hopeless, but the executive is not all
that bad. There are occassional good news about brave civil servants
in the Election Commission or Human Rights Commission who refuse to be
affected by the general rot.

The media in India, barring an occassional Indian Express here or a
Tarun Tejpal there, is quite useless. There is hardly any difference
between a mainstream newspaper like the Times of India and a tabloid
paper.

The BBC is different from regular media - it is not funded by
advertisements or government funding. Thus, it doesn't have to adjust
its programs or coverage to suit its advertisors or politicians, it
can afford to be fiercely independent and fair.

Hi,

Microsoft's WinXP EULA in plain English:
    http://linuxadvocate.org/articles.php?p=1

Sections 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 are scary!

I guess you have to be in the software industry to charge good

Message-ID: <a54a308e0605062347s40e63e9bx294de413fcf121b2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Firefox being the best browser, i was surprised to see its behaviour in
terms of CPU Usage. Without Firefox the CPU usage would  be 30% and once i
open Firefox, the CPU usage goes to 80% and it stays forever there at that
mark. If i close, the CPU comes down to 30%.

We also tested with thin clients. Firefox is bringing down the performance
of the server very badly. We tested with FC3 as our server. Is the Firefox
shipped with FC3 causing the problem?. Or should i need to test with RHEL or
SuSE Enterprise Linux Server ?. Now we are pushed to find an alternative to
Firefox in terms of performance, which i dont want to.

I would be happy to get inputs on how to make Firefox cpu usage low.

Thank You.

Why don't you try building Firefox on the machine you're using with 
"optimized" settings?  I believe some default builds come with "debug" 
settings on, talkback etc.

What version are you using?  What does your "about:buildconfig" say?

Please don't quote unnecessary conversations while posting a message.

You can use the tar(1) command to extract a tar archive.

# List the contents of the archive
shell> tar -tf file.tar

# Extract the contents
shell> tar -xf file.tar

# Read the tar(1) manual
shell> man tar

HTH.

I dont know by firefox sux, really sux on my linux , all my friend laugh at
me for my stubbon decision of using linux and firefox, firefox is really
slow and cpu consuming, not only that, it wont respond to mouse clicks to
change tabs... suppose i click on a link and try to change my tab to look at
other site, the tab will change once the page loads (in the clicked page)
but i am patient so that later versions of firefox will be faster. (Konqurer
with KDE is reported to be fastest on linux. or Mozilla on gnome).
I have tried this firefox on gentoo and other Linuses, but no use...

Strange! I don't experience the problems that you face.
What version of Firefox are you using?

BTW do you know that Gecko is by far the most complying with W3C 
standards? Now don't compare Firefox with Konqueror or Internet Explorer 
or Lynx.

> I have tried this firefox on gentoo and other Linuses, but no use...

"Linuses"?

Where did you get that from? Of course it is incorrect - Konqueror is
far more adherent to standards that Firefox is. Even Opera is ahead of
Firefox in terms of standards compliance.

It wasn't for nothing that Apple chose KHTML over Gecko for their
Safari browser.

--enable-optimize=-Os says you've optimized for size. Why don't you try

Hi

     Some time back i queried about Airtel modem(USB
one) in linux. And most of you replyed me that in
linux(FC2),  network is detected through ethernet card
and so 'go for   an ethernet based modem'

      But when the modem works in windows through USB,
why not in Linux?, i want to do this as a
project.please guide me on what i should learn etc..

Forget that ;)

What version of Firefox do you use? Why don't you try building Firefox 
with whatever optimal settings on your machine?

I'm using Gentoo/PPC and I don't experience any problems, even though I 
have Firefox, Flock and Thunderbird all open at the same time.

I'm not saying Firefox has a small memory footprint, but it doesn't suck 
that much ;)

How much RAM does your machine have in first place?

Because proprietary companies like micro$oft have an
agreement with USB modem vendors (winmodems, for
example) that they will not release chipset data
sheets  unless you sign an agreement with them.
Greedy, huh?

AFAIK, you can't run software in the air. It needs to
run on some piece of hardware. Without knowing the
hardware details you cannot write any software for it.

> why not in Linux?

Unless vendors provide their chipset details, there
isn't anything one can do.

But, hackers (programmers) have done good reverse
engineering and have written drivers for pci modems,
which you can try.

I have tried smart link modem drivers on both 2.4 and
2.6 kernels.

A newbie doesn't know all this, but, must know.

<IMO>
Voting in TamilNadu is equivalent to taking from one robber and giving
it to another. Makes no difference, in the end we get robbed.

Just thought it and found out my one vote is valued at:
* 1 Colour TV
* 2 acres of land
* X kg's of rice free/month (X depends on which part you are voting for)
* Some free Gold if I ever have a daughter :)

If robbers value my vote at the above commodities I'm sure it's worth more.
No thank you, I'm not giving it away.

The usual cause for Firefox discomfort is interoperability issues with
the extensions you may have installed. Check with Firefox in safe mode
(firefox -safe-mode) and see if your problem still persists.

In any case, nobody is forcing you to use Firefox. If you are not
happy with Firefox, you are welcome to use any other browser that you
deem fit. The driving principle of Free Software is that you don't get
to whine; you get to fix your problems yourself. For example, off the
top of my head, you have Konqueror, Galeon and a host of others -
http://freshmeat.net/browse/91 - Freshmeat's WWW Browsers category -
has 272 projects listed. Go try all of them and pick the one that best
suits you.

I believe there is a clause whereby you can vote but say that no party
is worthy of your vote.

I agree with Binand here.  Quite many problems are because of the badly 
written extensions leaking hell a lot of memory.

Disable the extensions and see which one is the problem and uninstall 
it.  Don't forget to mail the author of the extension about the problem 
you are facing.

At least some versions of firefox (older trunk builds for example) have 
bad memory leaks, looks like - they start hogging cpu and requiring a 
killall -9 after the firefox window's left open for several hours when 
I'm working.

The new "minefield" is a bit buggy but lots faster and much nicer though

Those are for pci dialup modems .. what the guy wants to setup is a USB 
dsl modem of the sort that airtel and other broadband providers provide 
(they also offer adsl broadband "routers" and you could just ask for those)

Sites like these have third party drivers:

http://eciadsl.flashtux.org
http://www.linux-usb.org/SpeedTouch/
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/accessrunner/
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/zyxel630-11

Depending on the model of the modem you have.  A lot of the usb dsl 
modems around in india will work with eciadsl or accessrunner.

2.6.15 seems to have support for quite a few USB PPPoA adsl modems (like 
speedtouch) by the way

Every television owner in the UK has to pay a monthly subscription fee
("television license") of approx. ?10 or so, which is used to fund the
BBC. The government subsidises this amount for the elderly and
disabled, but all others have to pay it.

The money is collected by private parties and handed over to the BBC
directly, so the government doesn't even get to see it. The
government's only recourse is to threaten to reduce the TV license fee
;)

BBC World Service is funded by the government, though.

not having a proxy is not the same as blocked. ssh is certainly not blocked - it
is just that we only have a web browsing proxy for general use and dont have
nat; claiming ssh is blocked puts intent and motive to the action which is not
there. general machines have no access to outside at all except for web browsing
(and anything that can be made to appear thus by tunnelling). all other services
are provided on a need-to case-by-case basis.

No. But it sends a message to the political parties that :
1. There are a lot of people who are disgruntled about the way things are
and
2. these people wont sit at home grumbling but would take the trouble to go
to the polling booth and register their protest.

The politicians know very well that once such people take the trouble to go
to the polling booth, it takes very little for a candidate with a good
record alone to win. When this happens parties like lokparitran (sure you
would know this party -  lokparitran.org) will slowly gain an upperhand. Not
necessary that lokparitran would have to win to make a difference. Just
garnering enough votes to let people know there are alternatives is enough.
At least existing dispensations will be forced to reform themselves.

Dont expect a knight in shining armour to incarnate suddenly, win the
election and change things for good overnight. The rut set in over the years
and it will take years (read many elections) to set it right. Technology
will certainly aid in clearing the rut at a faster pace. Blogs, camera
phones etc have democratised information dissemination. One is no longer
dependent on the 'party owned media' for their news (not entirely so at this
juncture but will happen for sure).

Pls understand that the politicians at present are quite happy that 'the
haves' wont go and vote - because they are hard to influence. So, if you
hope to see a change in your lifetime pls go and register your protest. You
owe this to future generations.

cheers

As an example of how well this works take a look at the recent elections 
in Thailand and what happened to Thaksin Shinwatra's "Thai Rak Thai" 
party - he is quite as good at offering freebies to woo poor people to 
vote for them as jayalalitha / karunanidhi are.. and probably just as 
corrupt as they are too.

I am using firefox 1.5.0.1 presently on Suse,
but I have tried same on gentoo by compiling it (a bit better) , used it on
Ubuntu and found to be realllllyyyy slow... moreover when ever I am
installing new version, its getting more and more slow. My ram is 512 +
128,  (i wonder if placement of RAM in slots matter?? ) my CPU  celeron 2.8
But I didnt try disabling extensions, I am using ck patches with desktop
optimization,
 FOR detailed comparison of browser speeds see
http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/browserSpeed.html

even the key strokes respond slower while typing,
ya i can use any other browser but they dont support all sites well..

true - i have an old version on one system - after some time (a week

ok, now i get it. its just that, by nature we are suspicious and 
attribute motives to anything authority does - which is not a bad 
thing. However, in view of the fact that ssh and IRC are essential 
tools for FOSS development it could be time for affirmative action 
in these spheres. Especially availability of ssh would prevent 
people getting into the bad practice of using ftp to maintain 
remote sites. Incidently, are M$ chat/IM thingies also blocked (or 
rather not provided)

May be your problem has nothing to do with Firefox and everything to do 
with GNOME ;)

BTW can you paste the output of "about:buildconfig"?  May be we can take 
a look at it.

Here is a link telling how you can make firefox fast, however he has also
added in the end, doing so , sometimes, the webserver may be high.

Am trying Opera now and it seems to look good.

Well, google calender is not supported. It gives that opera is not in the
calender supported list. Is Google trying to make people use only firefox??,
When some applications are written, they should comply with all browsers,
otherwise there is no "great" work in that and what i have noticed with
Google is that they support Firefox very much. The same scenario happened
few years ago with Microsoft and Internet Explorer.

 Processor - Pentium 4 HT
  1 GB RAM
 73.4 GB (SAS/SATA) HDD

my problem is that hdd is not a SATA or SCSI. that is inbetween the both. I
have searched their site for server spec and it is saying  Serial Attached
SCSI. I have found a drivers for RHEL 2 and 3 and suse linux 8 and 9. but
could not found any driver for FC3. I have searched for the driver for linux
and found it here
http://www.adaptec.com/worldwide/support/driverdetail.jsp?sess=no&language=English+US&cat=/Product/SAS-48300&filekey=adp94xx-1.0.8-6.src.tgz

First, FC3 is not good running it as a server.

If you check with your IBM vendors, they would give a list of servers that
can be installed in this server. If there are drivers for RHEL 2 or RHEL 3,
why dont you try downloading CentOS and installing it if really cost is a
constraint. But i would personally stay out of FC3.

By the way, this server is going to be used as?, i mean as an app-server,
mail server etc.,and what would be the server load?, becoz choosing fc3,
which is nearly 2 releases behind the latest one is not good.

FC3 is rather old, try with FC5.

So purchase a RHEL subscription. When you spend $1200 on a server, you
can certainly add $350 for a stable, supported OS on it.

On the other hand, you can have additional drivers installed during
the OS installation - it does ask for any additional driver CD/floppy
that you may have, or you could rebuild the installer kernel with the
additional driver. But the process can be quite time consuming.

yes i have tried to install the additional drivers, but i could not eject
the FC3 installation Cd from the Drive during installation. Eventhough it is
asking insert your driver cd to install the drivers it asking for press F2
to install the driver CDs, i could not able to eject the that installation
CD from that Drive.

is there any possiblites to mount a floppy drive to install additional
drivers during installation?

I 've got a passport(universally accepted proof for citizenship), butI'm
unable to vote coz, the ppl invlolved in listing the voters had made some
mistake. Noticing that my name is not there in the list, I had filed the
application to get my name in thrice. But still, after standing in the queue
today, I got to know that my name is still missing from the list. Would they
say that I don't need to pay some tax coz my name had been missed out from
the list? sad that I couldnt exercise my rights on the first opportunity.

You are mistaken.

Your passport only proves your nationality and is basically a travel
document. It does not prove your citizenship (check your passport, it
says only Nationality: Indian). Its main use is outside India, for
entry/exit into countries with whom India has diplomatic relations, to
protect your right of legal protection abroad, and to re-enter India.

Your Indian citizenship goes one step ahead - it allows you to vote in
India. The passport is not enough to prove your right to vote. That is
why we have these voter's ID cards.

Your name is missing from the electoral roll for several reasons:

1. You were not present when the enumerator came to your residence,
and you did not respond to his letter
2. You did not apply for the ID card or go for the photo-taking session
3. You could not prove your residency in a particular constituency
4. You have been disfranchised. :)

Remember that during the poll process, the ECI is grossly overworked;
and hence electoral roll updation will not happen at a very fast pace.
You ideally should have your voter's ID as soon as you turn 18, and
you should also ensure that your name is present in the electoral roll
of your constituency, whenever your residential address changes.

as the original poster most likely discovered (and not posted here, i guess)
this is unlikely to work. transconnect requires to be able to 'connect' to
arbitrary port numbers throught the proxy - a configuration which is not
supported on iitm campus.

like i said, "general machines have no access to outside at all except for web
browsing (and anything that can be made to appear thus by tunnelling)". nothing
is done to specifically enable or block m$ chat / im thingies. if the service
operates on plain http (without requiring connect to arbitrary ports), it will
just work. if not, it will most probably not work at all.

or install centos or scientific linux or some other rhel clone. your rhel
drivers should work 'out of the box' on the similarly numbered centos (or
other). i would strongly advise against fedora on any production machine -
updates sometimes break applications, even things like nis.

i had already left IIT, so didnt try it - as mentioned earlier, i 
got through with your-freedom for IRC. Apparently most users ssh 
into their machines in the labs and ssh out from there

For using the windows partition from linux it is enough if you just
edit the /etc/fstab file. Just add the corresponding drives in windows
and the filesystem you use.

for eg it will be something like this

/dev/hda1           /mnt/windows/c             ntfs          defaults 
          0       0

where the second column gives where the partition gets mounted... So
be sure to create that directory before proceeding....

Hi Gurus,
  I'm testing a tool in vmware.
I need to simulate 3 networks.
I need a routing equipment to route the pockets. So I?m planning to use Linux as router along with iptable. So I want to build a Linux image (a much as small possible). I want to run that Linux image like Knopix Cd.
Is there any way to build the Linux image only with iptable support (or the depended modules).

  Thanks & Regards

Hi,

We're having some trouble on the server using Fedora core 1. There are a lot of cdk* <cdk3lkgH> files in the /tmp directory. It is a Live Server.

Also, the web service stopped. I could not stop it or start it. I had to reboot the server. I have never seen anything like this before...

Well, use Knoppix, then. It ought to have everything you want.

Apache means its a perl or php script on your server that is creating these

Given you are running fedora core 1 its probably completely unupdated 
and you've been hacked .. or you have a badly and insecurely written 
script on your server that a spammer has broken into and is using it to 
send spam

Or maybe its a badly written script after all and its just going on 
eating up resources on your system.

Cant tell without looking at the server but you'd have to be crazy to 
run a fc1 server unpatched on a public IP open to the internet ..

Do you have any webapps running on this box? Anything PHP-based? With
the information you have given, it is tough to diagnose. Have you
looked at the apache logs? Your load average is pretty high, and 52%
of your CPU is taken by Apache. It could be that you are rooted, but
hard to say with the available information.

Run rpm -Va and look for the telltale signs.

Message-ID: <a1da1e5e0605090637r69be81f6h3d25a9d96a966996@mail.gmail.com>

I have installed FC5 in HP nx6120 laptop. When I update the package
through yum, I get error message of "Header is not complete".  I am
behind a corporate firewall. Yum home page suggest the following:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. 5: I get an "[Errno -1] Header is not complete." error from yum -
what the heck is going on?

A. It's probably a proxy somewhere between you and the repository. You
may not think that a proxy is in the way even though it really is.

You can try doing a "trace" with this command:

echo -e "TRACE / HTTP/1.1\nHost:  yum-server.example.com\n\n"  | nc
yum-server.example.com 80

Which should give you some more information about the network between
you and the repository. Also, be sure to replace
yum-server.example.com with whatever your yum repository server is.
Another diagnosis step is to get the box off of that network (not
always entirely possible, but port forwarding, VPN, or dialup can
simulate the experience) and see if you still have the problem.

The solutions to this problem are:
1. Get your proxy software/firmware updated so that it properly
implements HTTP 1.1
2. Use an FTP repository, where byte ranges are more commonly
supported by the proxy
3. Create a local mirror with rsync and then point your yum.conf to
that local mirror
4. Don't use yum
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I found that it is because of firewall. No chance of firmware update
on firewall. I can't mirror the entire repository (restricted
bandwidth for me). Except myself nobody uses Linux in our office. Can
any one suggest me FTP repository of FC5? or any other solution?

Can you get us the listing of "httpd -l" to begin with?
Is this a pre-bundled package or a hand-compiled one?

Hi guys,
I have a very unique problem and would be grateful if you could help me fix
it.
I have a FC5 x86_64 distro which was existing peacefully with Windows XP in
dual boot using grub. Then recently someone re-installed windows XP for some
reason, and it re-ordered the partitions. Then grub-install failed saying it
could not read /boot/grub/stage1. I read somewhere that this could be due to
wrong fstab entries.
Hence I did the dumbest thing, I renamed fstab. Now I can't even get into my
linux root using the rescue cd. It says no linux installation found.
  The problem is that the / is located in a logical volume group, which is
/dev/hda6 . I have tried everything and can't mount it. If I can find a way
to mount it I can get things back to normal

I know this is big but please help as I have important data to be recovered
and urgently.

Thanx in advance
Shiva

That is in your kernel (1) 

or 

if built as module will be in
/lib/modules/2.x.y/kernel/drivers/usb/core in 2.6
kernels. (2)

If its not in either of the above, you have to
recompile it.

You could probably boot in with a live CD, and then hand mount the 
appropriate /dev/foo your /home is on.

Compiled in modules:

  http_core.c
  mod_so.c

It is Pre-bundled, I think.

Well, do you load PHP/etc as Apache modules?  You could perhaps turn

Thats unlikely to work. FC5 installation requires a newer boot
environment than what RHEL 4 provides.

 I agree, I'm going to do a fresh install wihtout LVM. Anyways, thanx all of
you, but I managed to save my soul by installing a temporary version of
UBUNTU in a spare disk. Ubuntu automatically added the /dev/VolGroup100
entry.   After that it was a piece of cake. I recovered my data on to
another sata drive, but the original disk where fc5 was installed was pretty
messed up. Have to do a full fledged fdisk repartioning and formating. It'll
take me all night but I'm a hapyy man now.

Moral Of the story:
i) Never re-partition on a disk that has fc installed, if you can help it.
ii) Try to avoid LVM if ur prone to disasters.
iii) If Fedora fails, there's always Ubuntu.
Thanx guys.

Message-ID: <4460D2D8.1050509@gmail.com>

   Hi Luggies,

   I was very happy on the first day I went to my new office ( Ten Miles
   Corp, chennai ). My boss gave me the freedom to install whatever distro i
   want, as I am entitled to work as web developer in PHP_MySql. He also
   asked to setup a pilot server setup, which will eventually give them
   confidence to move using a Linux based server from the existing windows
   2003 server.

   For the least 3 days, I have tried with FC4, Ubuntu, Suse and finally
   FreeBSD. ( i know, i missed Debian) There is one main problem which i am
   facing. I have been given a custom assembled DELL system, whose hardware
   connot be changed (except mouse, keyboard and monitor). The monitor is
   actualy a 15" LG product branded a DELL. But, whatever distro i install it
   is not able to bring up any other resolition than 600x480 ( the least
   resolution which causes bottom 30% of the screen to be not visible at
   all). I complained him that it is a hardware problem and changing the
   monitor might be a good idea. So, he generously bought me a 17" Samsung
   LCD monitor today for 13,000 Rs.

   Still, we are not able to change resolution with FC4 and Ubuntu. With
   FreeBSD 6, it starts vwm ( don't rem the name exactly) as the default
   desktop instead of Gnome or KDE. How to change this or start GNOME/KDE ?
   When i start x from the console, it is vwm ( i had to find it from the
   title of the menu which appeared when clicked at the top of the indivudual
   window).

   Those guys got fed up and asked me to continue using windows :(( Does
   anyone have idea about what's going wrong ? When i ran ubuntu live cd, the
   a part of the desktop went and hid in the left hand side of the monitor,
   leaving a blank black portion of the right. We tried our best to move the
   desktop, but even when it is moved max, its still the same. Also, the
   resolution couldn't be changed to even 800x600 :(

   I am planning to try out Suse tomorrow, which was fine when i tried
   installed in my home. But, as usual, it couldn't startx in my PC,
   hopefully due to my nvidia fx5200 card. :( I never expected things to getb
   this much troublesome.

1. Get the exact model number and google for its
monitor specification (horizontal synchronization
rate, vertical refresh rate, buffer size).

2. Google for existing xorg.conf or XF86Config files
for this monitor.

Which version of Ubuntu? Send me your snail mail
address and I shall courier you a copy of the latest
Ubuntu Dapper Beta.

You never told us how you were trying to change the
resolution. Can you post your X configuration file
(xorg.conf or XF86Config)?

You can try to add entries manually under Section
"Screen", Modes in these files and see if the
resolution loads.

Find out the horizontal and vertical sync rate of the monitor from the
manuals and use it in the x configuration file /etc/X11/xorg.conf (xorg)
eg:
Section "Monitor"
        Identifier      "SyncMaster 793s"
        Option          "DPMS"
        HorizSync       30-70
        VertRefresh     50-160
EndSection

The most common reason is an unsupported graphics card. Find out the details
of the graphics card and search for an appropriate driver.

When in x window, you can try ctrl alt + or ctrl alt - to change the
resoultion.

Even my least supported unichrome chip works smoother in newer distros, so
try a recent one such as Ubuntu-Dapper which comes with a very polished
version of xorg - xorg7

Why you need X on a server to work on php, mysql. You should always install
the minimum software required for the work.

hi luggies,
i want to build  a distro which is intended for java developers like it 
should comprise
tools like jdk , jre , eclipse IDE ,tomcat , jboss and i want  to build 
this distro as Debian flavour.
It should also have the default tools like Gnome , web browser, mail 
client , open office , Gimp.
how can i build such a distro which is intended only for Java developers 
so that the user  may just
install the distro and start developing java apps . ... Please help.

Cheers.

Our office equipped with a Sonic Firewall, through which we connect to
net. I inquired the System Admin. He will take some time to analyze

"dirty" ? Can you provide a screenshot?
  
> Is it monitor , mouse or vga card problem?  

Nothing to do with your mouse.

Try to boot from a LiveCD and see if you still get
distorted images. If no, then it isn't a hardware
problem.

Hi,

I have linux server running in RH 7.3 and FC2. On these servers we
have implement the Bige card (connected through fiber cable). But the
snmp is showing only 99 mb traffic even though the traffic on the
server is more than 120 mb traffic on the interface.

do we need to change any configuration or in code to support the Gige
card and to get the value more the 100 mb traffic.

Curious ... would a screenshot capture fuzziness or whatever
introduced by the monitor? How does it work anyway ...

Subject: [Ilugc] Building Linux image

Hi Gurus,
I'm testing a tool in vmware.
I need to simulate 3 networks.
I need a routing equipment to route the pockets. So I?m planning to use Linux as router along with iptable. So I want to build a Linux image (a much as small possible). I want to run that Linux image like Knopix Cd.
Is there any way to build the Linux image only with iptable support (or the depended modules).

Thanks & Regards
Vijay

Hi,

We're having some trouble on the server using Fedora core 1. There are a lot of cdk* files in the /tmp directory. It is a Live Server.

Well, use Knoppix, then. It ought to have everything you want.

Otherwise, take your pick from:

Apache means its a perl or php script on your server that is creating these

Given you are running fedora core 1 its probably completely unupdated 
and you've been hacked .. or you have a badly and insecurely written 
script on your server that a spammer has broken into and is using it to 
send spam

Or maybe its a badly written script after all and its just going on 
eating up resources on your system.

Cant tell without looking at the server but you'd have to be crazy to 
run a fc1 server unpatched on a public IP open to the internet ..

Do you have any webapps running on this box? Anything PHP-based? With
the information you have given, it is tough to diagnose. Have you
looked at the apache logs? Your load average is pretty high, and 52%
of your CPU is taken by Apache. It could be that you are rooted, but
hard to say with the available information.

Run rpm -Va and look for the telltale signs.

Subject: [Ilugc] "Header is not complete" error for yum!

I have installed FC5 in HP nx6120 laptop. When I update the package
through yum, I get error message of "Header is not complete". I am
behind a corporate firewall. Yum home page suggest the following:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. 5: I get an "[Errno -1] Header is not complete." error from yum -
what the heck is going on?

A. It's probably a proxy somewhere between you and the repository. You
may not think that a proxy is in the way even though it really is.

You can try doing a "trace" with this command:

echo -e "TRACE / HTTP/1.1\nHost: yum-server.example.com\n\n" | nc
yum-server.example.com 80

Which should give you some more information about the network between
you and the repository. Also, be sure to replace
yum-server.example.com with whatever your yum repository server is.
Another diagnosis step is to get the box off of that network (not
always entirely possible, but port forwarding, VPN, or dialup can
simulate the experience) and see if you still have the problem.

The solutions to this problem are:
1. Get your proxy software/firmware updated so that it properly
implements HTTP 1.1
2. Use an FTP repository, where byte ranges are more commonly
supported by the proxy
3. Create a local mirror with rsync and then point your yum.conf to
that local mirror
4. Don't use yum
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I found that it is because of firewall. No chance of firmware update
on firewall. I can't mirror the entire repository (restricted
bandwidth for me). Except myself nobody uses Linux in our office. Can
any one suggest me FTP repository of FC5? or any other solution?

Can you get us the listing of "httpd -l" to begin with?
Is this a pre-bundled package or a hand-compiled one?

Subject: [Ilugc] FC5 logical volume group

Hi guys,
I have a very unique problem and would be grateful if you could help me fix
it.
I have a FC5 x86_64 distro which was existing peacefully with Windows XP in
dual boot using grub. Then recently someone re-installed windows XP for some
reason, and it re-ordered the partitions. Then grub-install failed saying it
could not read /boot/grub/stage1. I read somewhere that this could be due to
wrong fstab entries.
Hence I did the dumbest thing, I renamed fstab. Now I can't even get into my
linux root using the rescue cd. It says no linux installation found.
The problem is that the / is located in a logical volume group, which is
/dev/hda6 . I have tried everything and can't mount it. If I can find a way
to mount it I can get things back to normal

I know this is big but please help as I have important data to be recovered
and urgently.

Thanx in advance
Shiva

That is in your kernel (1) 

or 

if built as module will be in
/lib/modules/2.x.y/kernel/drivers/usb/core in 2.6
kernels. (2)

If its not in either of the above, you have to
recompile it.

Subject: [Ilugc] Building Linux image

Hi Gurus,
I'm testing a tool in vmware.
I need to simulate 3 networks.
I need a routing equipment to route the pockets. So I?m planning to use Linux as router along with iptable. So I want to build a Linux image (a much as small possible). I want to run that Linux image like Knopix Cd.
Is there any way to build the Linux image only with iptable support (or the depended modules).

Thanks & Regards
Vijay

Well, use Knoppix, then. It ought to have everything you want.

Apache means its a perl or php script on your server that is creating these

Given you are running fedora core 1 its probably completely unupdated 
and you've been hacked .. or you have a badly and insecurely written 
script on your server that a spammer has broken into and is using it to 
send spam

Or maybe its a badly written script after all and its just going on 
eating up resources on your system.

Cant tell without looking at the server but you'd have to be crazy to 
run a fc1 server unpatched on a public IP open to the internet ..

Do you have any webapps running on this box? Anything PHP-based? With
the information you have given, it is tough to diagnose. Have you
looked at the apache logs? Your load average is pretty high, and 52%
of your CPU is taken by Apache. It could be that you are rooted, but
hard to say with the available information.

Run rpm -Va and look for the telltale signs.

Subject: [Ilugc] "Header is not complete" error for yum!

I have installed FC5 in HP nx6120 laptop. When I update the package
through yum, I get error message of "Header is not complete". I am
behind a corporate firewall. Yum home page suggest the following:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. 5: I get an "[Errno -1] Header is not complete." error from yum -
what the heck is going on?

A. It's probably a proxy somewhere between you and the repository. You
may not think that a proxy is in the way even though it really is.

You can try doing a "trace" with this command:

echo -e "TRACE / HTTP/1.1\nHost: yum-server.example.com\n\n" | nc
yum-server.example.com 80

Which should give you some more information about the network between
you and the repository. Also, be sure to replace
yum-server.example.com with whatever your yum repository server is.
Another diagnosis step is to get the box off of that network (not
always entirely possible, but port forwarding, VPN, or dialup can
simulate the experience) and see if you still have the problem.

The solutions to this problem are:
1. Get your proxy software/firmware updated so that it properly
implements HTTP 1.1
2. Use an FTP repository, where byte ranges are more commonly
supported by the proxy
3. Create a local mirror with rsync and then point your yum.conf to
that local mirror
4. Don't use yum
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I found that it is because of firewall. No chance of firmware update
on firewall. I can't mirror the entire repository (restricted
bandwidth for me). Except myself nobody uses Linux in our office. Can
any one suggest me FTP repository of FC5? or any other solution?

Can you get us the listing of "httpd -l" to begin with?
Is this a pre-bundled package or a hand-compiled one?

Subject: [Ilugc] FC5 logical volume group

Hi guys,
I have a very unique problem and would be grateful if you could help me fix
it.
I have a FC5 x86_64 distro which was existing peacefully with Windows XP in
dual boot using grub. Then recently someone re-installed windows XP for some
reason, and it re-ordered the partitions. Then grub-install failed saying it
could not read /boot/grub/stage1. I read somewhere that this could be due to
wrong fstab entries.
Hence I did the dumbest thing, I renamed fstab. Now I can't even get into my
linux root using the rescue cd. It says no linux installation found.
The problem is that the / is located in a logical volume group, which is
/dev/hda6 . I have tried everything and can't mount it. If I can find a way
to mount it I can get things back to normal

I know this is big but please help as I have important data to be recovered
and urgently.

Thanx in advance
Shiva

That is in your kernel (1) 

or 

if built as module will be in
/lib/modules/2.x.y/kernel/drivers/usb/core in 2.6
kernels. (2)

If its not in either of the above, you have to
recompile it.

If you buy a product (PC with a preloaded RH WS3 install) that HCL sells 
you should expect a copy of the OEM'd media that Redhat gives HCL

If some salesman from a HCL dealer is just buying blank boxes (or 
probably boxes with DOS), installing some random linux version and 
selling it that's another story altogether.  And RH WS-3's licensing 
makes it as much piracy as if the salesman were instead installing a 
cracked copy of WinXP

Message-ID: <2e6ce1830605102059wdbfd90apbfb9e3541dd89752@mail.gmail.com>

HI,

I recently installed FC5 from the linuxforyou DVD. The installation went
smooth, but when it tried to boot for the first time, it froze when it tried
to "Checking for new hardware". Then I restarted in single mode and did
"chkconfig kudzu off" and then "init 3". This time it continued to load, but
and got freezed when loading haldaemon. I can hear a single beep when it is
freezing in haldaemon or when it checking for hardware changes. I had to
"chkconfig haldaemon off" in single mode. Now it is working fine. I have no
probs in browsing the net or listening to songs. I never had this problem
when I was working with Fedora core 4 or FC2.
My question is:

Is this a bug in fedora core 5?
Is is ok to run linux having kudzu and haldaemon off?

The computer has no hardware issues, as it is a dual boot with Windows XP
and I have no probs in XP.

Thanks for your help.

Sendil.

We have to configure FTP for file transfer between the local server and the

if it comes as an oem preinstalled version they HAVE to give you the media

and they cant just go install fc5 on one of the pcs for you - the cost 
of the PC includes the cost of a ws-3 license.

They probably have an OEM agreement with Redhat. The whole point is,
whichever OS they preinstall, they are obliged to give you one set of
installation/recovery/whateveryoucallit CDs to you. If your vendor
didn't, then force him to. Publish his name here so that others can
steer clear of him. Tell the vendor that you are going to publish his
name in user groups in Chennai and that his sales are going to go
down.

Next, go get RHEL ES 4.0 from Redhat and install it. Their website has
details on how to obtain it.

I haven't used this particular parser but have used another famous parser -
expat.
Where its is needed to simple set the appropriate handler, here
sc_parse_start
is called every time a new tag appears in the data, ppchAttr contains the
attribute values pairs.

eg:

void XMLCALL sc_parse_start(
        void* pContext,
        const char* pchElement,
        const char** ppchAttr
        )
{
        //ppchAttr -> Attr, value
}

void XMLCALL sc_data(
        void* pContext,
        const char* pchData,
        int nLen
        )
{
}

void XMLCALL sc_parse_end(
        void* pContext,
        const char* pchElement
        )
{
}


int main()
{
        XML_Parser x_parser;
        x_parser = XML_ParserCreate(NULL);
        XML_SetUserData(x_parser, this);
        XML_SetElementHandler(x_parser, sc_parse_start, sc_parse_end);
        XML_SetCharacterDataHandler(x_parser, sc_data);

        status = XML_Parse(x_parser, achBuf, rcount, feof(pFile));
}

I am sorry to have been misunderstood. I quote myself:

unfortunately the people here believe that CONNECT is altogether evil.

I had referred to people perhaps believing that *CONNECT* is evil. I
never had, and had never intended to talk of evil motives. But CONNECT
is blocked for most ports (https is an exception), and the way to
allow transparent tunneling of any service over a HTTP proxy, is
through CONNECT. For example:

~| telnet 10.65.0.34 3128
CONNECT freenode.org:6667 HTTP/1.1

results in an "Access Denied" message. I guess you had replied
yourself that only web browsing is allowed. If the proxy doesn't allow
tunneling by NAT/CONNECT/Socks equivalent, the service then *is*
blocked. What your-freedom.net does is double tunneling, you once
tunnel to their HTTP/SOCKS proxy, and then use CONNECT over that
proxy; and that is to use HTTP(S) for all tasks, and hence work around
the block. AFAIK, most IRC/CVS servers outside don't use port 80 or do
any sort of wrapping around HTTP. So, it is impossible to access them
without an external service working, like your-freedom.
your-freedom.net is a commercial service, which offers a free edition
with a cap of a measly 8 KBps. (Secondary Rant: the your-freedom
client is the only process on my comp which uses 25 MB of RAM, apart
from ffox and X; and the only process which uses over 20 threads. Long
live Java :) ). I have encountered many situations where people tried
to checkout E17, or even Gaim, over CVS and gave up because of the
speed. (The codebase of E17 is around 150 MB, because of all the
picture data). I provide them with snapshots, while checking out using
a department machine. Many people decline to switch over to linux
because most chat protocols use an arbitrary service, and also provide
a client which can wrap around HTTP using a custom protocol which the
free software world doesn't understand. This means that you either use
CONNECT and something like Gaim (Gaim does support some protocols over
HTTP, which the feature set is quite limited), or use a Windows-based
client which can work over any HTTP proxy. (your-freedom came to the
rescue again, though.)

My original mail only commented that tunneling using CONNECT over the
public proxies at IITM to many services outside, which are quite
useful to any free software enthusiast.

Regards,
Ramkumar.

as i had indicated, the public proxies only support web browsing - nothing 
else. if some other service works, good. 

> I guess you had replied yourself that only web browsing is allowed.

thats not what i said. it is not a question of allowing or not allowing 
something. this is what i said in another post to the group.

"not having a proxy is not the same as blocked. ssh is certainly not
blocked - it is just that we only have a web browsing proxy for general
use and dont have nat; claiming ssh is blocked puts intent and motive to
the action which is not there. general machines have no access to outside
at all except for web browsing (and anything that can be made to appear
thus by tunnelling). all other services are provided on a need-to
case-by-case basis."

> If the proxy doesn't allow tunneling by NAT/CONNECT/Socks equivalent,
> the service then *is* blocked.

you may argue that not having a service is the same as blocked, but i dont
agree with that. the question is motive. for example, going by what is
there in the hostels, one might say that having phones (land line) in the
room is blocked. but it is not and was never the case. it was just that
the rooms were not individually wired for phones at all. if one wanted
(and was willing to pay appropriately), one could get a direct land line
connection to the room. whereas, if there was a policy to block, one would
not be able to get such a connection at all. now with institue giving
space for cell phone companies to set up towers, that service is enabled
and available to all. in a similar vein, i expect arbitrary services (not
just web browsing) to be similarly available sometime (dont know when). if 
the intent were to really block, the firewall(s) would be programmed 
appropriately and it would be quite painful to get around that, if at all.

A live upgrade on a production box is generally a bad idea.
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAQ has the recommended upgrade
procedures.

You might want to read up the administration and security guides at
http://redhat.com/docs. They are for RHEL but the principles apply to
Fedora too usually.

If its a x86_64 system, the kudzu issue is apparently related to video.

Turning off kudzu is fine if the system doesnt undergo hardware changes.
Hal daemon is required for many of desktop application especially the
GNOME ones. You might want to try updating your apps by running yum
update and otherwise report this issue in http://bugzilla.redhat.com

But why go in for fc3 when fc5 is out
Also if yum still gets the updates then why should u need an upgrade to fc3,
the numbers fc1, fc3 are immaterial when u have all your software upto-date

Try  physics, chemistry, biotechnology, economics and you will see
atleast 3 of the top 4 to be indian cities. Infact most "tech" related

Hi,

I would like to know as to how I can input unicode
characters based on their number in
gedit/bluefish/xchat. Currently using Ubuntu Dapper
Beta on x86.

I am able to copy the text (Latin characters, for
example) as such from a web page, and paste it to
gedit/bluefish/xchat.

But, if I need to key-in directly, how do I go about
doing it?

I don't have a Latin keyboard indicator in Ubuntu
Dapper Beta, only Latin American and it doesn't seem
to have Latin characters.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

SK

I doubt it for two reasons:
1) A search on google.cn/trends still turns up Chennai.
2) Some keywords don't come up in India (Astronomy, for example)

It is not an x86_64 system. It is an 32 bit system. It was a fresh install.

So, haldaemon is not required by any crucial services like network or
iptables, right?
I meant to ask whether it won't interfere with vital system programs like
selinux or httpd.

Thanks a lot.

ethernet? so its a "dsl router"?

connect your dsl router to the wireless access point by an ethernet 
cable. Set the access point up as a "Transparent bridge"

So it just sits there and you are connected over wifi to the network, 
and can get IPs from the dsl router

google / read the config docs on your netgear, and the dsl router's 
control panel if necessary, for more

BSNL is not alone here... I've been hit by Airtel billing blunders too.
Around this time last year, I was sent a monthly bill of Rs 70,000 (!)
for a 512kbps DSL connection.

Every ISP billing dept has to face angry customes due to poor traffic
metering.  Seems like unlimited traffic schemes are actually beneficial
to both parties.

I learnt never to sign up for automatic payments -- credit card or
direct debit or whatever -- whenever there's a variable cost associated
with a service.

You can use the keyboard layouts, which is available in the Gnome or

If its a x86_64 system, the kudzu issue is apparently related to video.

> Is is ok to run linux having kudzu and haldaemon off?

Turning off kudzu is fine if the system doesnt undergo hardware changes.
Hal daemon is required for many of desktop application especially the
GNOME ones. You might want to try updating your apps by running yum
update and otherwise report this issue in http://bugzilla.redhat.com

But why go in for fc3 when fc5 is out
Also if yum still gets the updates then why should u need an upgrade to fc3,
the numbers fc1, fc3 are immaterial when u have all your software upto-date
u can check this

Try  physics, chemistry, biotechnology, economics and you will see
atleast 3 of the top 4 to be indian cities. Infact most "tech" related

Hi,

I would like to know as to how I can input unicode
characters based on their number in
gedit/bluefish/xchat. Currently using Ubuntu Dapper
Beta on x86.

I am able to copy the text (Latin characters, for
example) as such from a web page, and paste it to
gedit/bluefish/xchat.

But, if I need to key-in directly, how do I go about
doing it?

I don't have a Latin keyboard indicator in Ubuntu
Dapper Beta, only Latin American and it doesn't seem
to have Latin characters.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

SK

I doubt it for two reasons:
1) A search on google.cn/trends still turns up Chennai.
2) Some keywords don't come up in India (Astronomy, for example)

IMO there are no reliable ISP billing solutions available till recently (or
even now) .
Few years ago, I was called to visit a isp (asia net) to device a reliable
billing system for them.
They had a billing solution ( some 24 online)  purchased at a huge
price ( many lacs).
And like this , on billing disputes, every day many customers were shouting
at the counter , at the head office and some even went to court.
I spent a few days in their office in thiruvendrum.
The 24 online billing software was a real crap and full of mess.
After studying for a few days i teamed up with a friend of mine and offered
to device a billing system in Linux.
They were very sceptical to accept the offer.
Reason :Our cost was just Rs. 25,000.
The asianet management might have thought that , even after buying a
software for 5 lacs , there are so much trouble. If it is replaced with a
25,000 one , the troubles will  only multiply.
For some reason , they rejected our offer.
But my friend just retained the idea and went on to develop the billing
software.
He completed it and started selling it. ( for 500 $ )
In the past 3+ years he has sold more than 100 copies now.
 It can account usage time , up/down traffic and apply different rates
for different schemes ( prepaid/postpaid etc) and generate a bill.

Though now it is used for billing mostly by large scale browsing centers all
over the world, it is actually designed for isps.
a few isps are using it for years(but no major isps from India except a few
category C isps.) Hardly any billing disputes

I visited many isps including bsnl to try promoting this solution.
Some how they did not want to try it even for free.

It was not surprised. Since the fate of Linux itself is the same.

It costs less.( or even no cost). It is very reliable.
People have something unreliable bought at heavy price and going thro pain.
(like m$). But 90 % of them don't want to change.

Why......?

Whoever designed 24online deserves to be shot..

Huge NAT'ted network of cablemodem connected PCs, little or no virus 
filtering, very antique software (sendmail 8.9.3) installed by default.. 
probably rh 6.1 or something similar

And zero protection within our outside the lan against crackers, virus 
attempts etc.. its like every PC in such a LAN can see all the cable ISP 
connected PCs like a big network neighborhood on windows.

Message-ID: <a1da1e5e0605112250j6a0db91ch1f31fcc2fdfb0715@mail.gmail.com>

I have installed Fedora Core 5 on my HP nx6120 Laptop. It looks faster
and stable than previous releases.

My observations:
1. Faster booting - it takes 60 seconds to get login screen.
2. Faster GNOME - takes 4 seconds to get desktop from gdm.
3. Samba client and Server - I am able to connect to all my Windows
PCs and Servers in LAN without any issues. Windows Printer was
configured using System->Administration->Printing tool successfully.
4. Tamil support is excellent with good fonts rendering (definitely
better than Ubuntu Dapper).
5. I have set SCIM as default Input Method frame work, which fits
natively to the entire desktop.
6. OpenOffice - starts and works faster. (Why there is no default menu
item for Draw tool? It is my favourite)
7. I installed FC5 with GNOME as desktop. After installation when I
try to install additional applications, yum always fetches from online
repos and mirrors. An option to add a CD/DVD as repository (as in
synaptic) will be a nice feature *** really worth feature ***. How to
vote for this feature in Fedora Core site?
8. Beagle is an wonderful tool. The Deskbar applet finds most useful
and well configurable (But unable to input tamil based on scim).
9. Power Management - Hibernate does not work. Can anybody help me in
doing it specific to Fedora Core 5?
10. Network Manager is awesome. I did not do any console based
configuration. My wired and wireless working fine with this tool. I am
able to switch between these two just like that.
11. Totem consume more CPU and also not stable - definitely we need a
good default multimedia player. ( I know that mplayer, xine and vlc
are there - I meant **default**. I don't talk about the proprietory
formats. I want open formats to be played efficiently and stable). Can
any one tell me why most distros keep totem as default?
12. Minimizing XMMS (borderless windows) causes restoring of all other
windows and flickering - waiting for this bug to be fixed.

In summary Fedora Core 5 is definitely a great desktop - thanks to fedora team!

I rarely shutdown my laptops, I just put it in standby mode (suspend to
ram) or hibernate (suspend to disk).  You can leave all your apps running.
IMO, remembering last used state is essential for any kind of machine, I
don't want to start with a blank screen every time I boot up.  The Firefox
Session Saver extension is indispensable.

The machines typically lasts atleast 36hrs on batteries in standby mode.

Waking up from standby, my laptop becomes usable (including network
access) in ~5 seconds, and it comes back with Firefox, Thunderbird, etc.
in exactly the same state when I put it to sleep.

Waking up from hibernation it reaches usable state is 20-25 seconds.

I got a idea to handle the attributes from a GTK tutorial.  Here is
the code segment (using libxml2):

<snip>
if (cur->type == XML_ELEMENT_NODE &&
    !xmlStrcmp (cur->name, (const xmlChar *) "myTag"))
{
    printf ("TAG: %s \n", cur->name);
    key = xmlGetProp (cur, "myAttribute");
    if (key)
        printf ("--> myAttribute=%s\n", key);
    xmlFree(key);
}
</snip>

About 4 yrs back, I was freelancing and had proposed to implement a workflow
software (for tracking progress of new installations) for the fixed wireless
division of BSNL. I felt they were quite impressed with my presentation of
how the system will work but the moment I mentioned my price (Rs. 40K) I
could sense the disbelief in my audience! They asked if it was all legal
software. I assured them so but even then I did not get it! I guess they
assumed I was just a joker :-)

How is it nowadays? Have things changed for the better?

Very similar experience for me also.
They treated us like  jokers.

We felt so insulted that after coming out, my friend pissed on a bsnl board

Hi Bharathi, Vivek, and others,

I found out :)

Method I (GUI-based):

By default, UTF-8 support is enabled. So, we only need
to know how to input the characters. There aren't any
keyboard layouts for Latin characters.

Under Keyboard Preferences, you can set a Composite
key (for example, RightAlt key). So, to input Latin
characters, you can press,

<Composite key> + ' + e = ??

Method II (command-line):

In your /etc/X11/XF8config or /etc/X11/xorg.conf you
can set this composite key (say to your right winblow$
key) under Section "Keyboard"

  Option "XkbOptions" "compose:rwin"

and restart X server.

Regards,

SK

Do you have an in-built wireless or are you using
USB-wireless or PCMCIA-based wireless cards? If yes,
which one?
 
Open a terminal and post output of:

 /sbin/iwconfig -a
 /sbin/lsmod

Note, you can redirect output to a file:

 /sbin/lsmod > lsmod.txt

Please post the above outputs so we can have a look.

Message-ID: <8a32b1ca0605120309g153b986cud777d2bec246cc39@mail.gmail.com>

hi

steps to setup

connections:
1. connect airtel router and wireless access point router at external
ethernet point
2. connect your desktop PC to Wireless access point internal ethernet point

setup:
1.Check your IP address from desktop/laptop from which you  are connectng to
internet and give the same as wireless router external ip address.
2. select Dynamic address resolution for both PC and Laptop
3. In wireless router set DHCP on
4. Configure DNS in Wireless router
5. Alternatively you can assign ip to PC and Laptop in the Wirelesss router
internal ip range(192.168.168.xxx) and gateway will be of Wirelesss router
internal ip (192.168.168.1) DNS as Given by the Airtel people or as
PC/Laptop current configuration

That's it now you lan and wireless lan of laptop will be in same subnet
group so you can acces lan and wireless router will route both PC and Laptop
to Internet through airtel router

hope this helps

you can call me at 9384741935

It depends on what you want to use it for... the access pattern --
read, write, search, etc.,  the data type it's supposed to contain, etc.

Reading your college data structures text book should prove very
enlightening.  Don Knuth's Art of Programming is *the* text, or the data
structures and algorithms section from The Practice of Programming,
Kernighan and Pike.

Like data structures, list digests also have a purpose.  And please

For ranking, it sorts the countries based on the first keyword, which
u can see from the bar graph. It applies the first keyword as the
filter and just puts in the trend for the second keyword for those
entries. thats the reason for the difference.

Wiki is not removed. Our web server was upgraded with-out informing to
us and after upgrading there was some domain related issues. That is
solved now. But the DB is not restored properly. This week end, I am
planning to get the old backup and restore it. Soon it will come back 
normal condition.

This is already requested and planned for the next release. We need to
get some changes done in yum and pirut to support this.

Meanwhile you can configure a local repository yourself if you need to.

Hardware specific. File a bug report with the output of lshal against

one wonders why sysadmins do things like this - it is so easy to 
inform users before hand, but they just dont bother. I am not 
pointing a finger at IITM, the same thing happened to me on a 
commercial server the other day and my sites were down for several 
hours - just when the client was demoing them to his team

I meant to say **atleast** it should work stable for open codecs. I
have tested totem in various desktops and laptops. When compared with
other media players, it takes more cpu time and not stable. Is it just
me or like that only? Is there any specific reason for adhering with
totem for default media player instead of other media players?

SIXTY SECONDS is fast ?? I can imagine how slow previous Fedoras were.
My ArchLinux boots in 9 seconds and to the gdm it takes another 3.
If i strip some stuff like statup network. I can make it 6 seconds. But it

Fedora runs reasonable number of services when it enters runlevel 5.
considering this, it is really good speed. I don't know much about
ArchLinux, can you tell me what are all the services available when it
boots in 9 seconds.

Sorry to ask again.
The HCL Report sheet with the pc says that " this machine is loaded with Red
 Hat linux WS3.0"
so, what we have is an authorised software? or a pirated one?

I have been a customer of HCL for over 17 years. They normally do not
do such illegal things. They must be having agreement with Redhat. In
fact till few years they were loading debian in PCs if you do not
order any OS.

Instead of sending mail after mail, please call HCL and get the
position clarified. If the the redhat linux is legal you can get
recovery/full cd set easily from them.

Have you asked HCL regarding this. Why dont you just question them and ask
the same?. Ask whether have they charged for WS3.0 and if yes, ask them the
Cds. This is not a big issue to be dealt if you interact with HCL properly

lest one gets the wrong idea, cennailug.org is not hosted by or at iitm. iitm is

So many people have suggested what you should do

Like I said configure your netgear as a transparent bridge, connect it 
to the ethernet port of your beetel modem. Then connect your PC's 
ethernet to the rear of the netgear, and use your laptop's wifi card to 
latch onto the netgear.

You should be connected to your local LAN and then get an IP from your 
beetel modem.

Rackspace provides, well, rackspace. Costs covered by Chennai Online.
Future Infotech seems to be Rackspace's resellers, the guys who sold

Looks to me a dedicated server - which costs a fair amount (I pay ?30

On a similar note, theres a tool called initng which strips off your

The primary developer and maintainer of totem happens to work for Red
Hat. So its easier to poke and get bugs fixed but the real reason is
that media players these days tend to frontends to the frameworks doing
the real job. I havent had any trouble with totem on FC5. If you have
any particular file that hangs up totem in a reproducible fashion, a
report would be appreciated. Hard to talk about a issue without very
specific details.

1. ISP authentication is different from relay authentication. The isp auth
is for your connectivity. relay auth is for using their mail server to relay
your mails.

2.Why u want to relay thro your isp mail server. You can make your mail
server do the "smtp out" directly.

3. Now a days mails service providers generally dont allow any one to use
their server to relay mails. If they do, then if you do spam,they run the
risk of getting blocked by spam databases.

or Firefox or anything. I really dont care about that. All I need is
the whole email converted into an image( JPG/PPM).
 Does anyone know of any method to do this?
I run Ubuntu and use GOCR to convert the image back into text. I am
running some tests on emails with images. Right now, I manually
convert the emails into images by taking screenshots. I want to run a
lot of tests and quantify the results and so need an automated
process. I was thinking that Python's email library and its imaging
library might hold something and thats what am looking into.

Thanks

You can use the GD library to manipulate images. You can also create
images from text. The GD library is a very simple library that lets
you play around with already existing images or create new ones. Here
is a link to a Linux Gazette article I wrote long ago on using GD:

http://linuxgazette.net/issue91/shuveb.html

You can also use the Imagemagik package to achieve similar results.
Please see its man page.

Run your files through html2ps (check your distro for the pkgs).  Batch
convert ps files to whatever raster format you require using gimp.  Note
that you need to convert your emails to pure html (convert email headers
such as from/to/cc/subject/etc. to html) before using html2ps.


If html2ps does not produce good output, here are a few more things
to try out:

Load the text/html into a HTML widget of your choice, and call xwd
to save the screenshot to disk.  Pretty easy using tcl/tk's html widget.

Use a GUI testing tool such as Perl's X11:GUITest
    http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2006/02/02/x11_gui_testing.html
and automate your key strokes.  Load your emails into mozilla or
whatever and fire away.

Unlike html2ps, this still leaves you with the problem when the entire
text is not visible on screen and scrolling is necessary.

If you do that from a dynamic IP - most ISPs, including us (we run spam

Have you heard of something called smtp auth?  If not please do look it

It is a handy auth mechanism - though a bit complex to set up

Lots of people using old email clients, or sometimes handheld devices 
whose mail programs may not always support AUTH ..

true, but i find that it allows anyone whatsoever to use the relay 
as long as an authorised user has done a POP within the last 30 
minutes

Actually people should set an appropriate relay window - not as big as 
30 mins. 5..15 minutes is the usual.

"They are certainly going beyond the point where they take code from the US
and Europe and spend their effort "localising" it by adding support for
local languages."

Every linux community or LUG in India are trying out the same as Bill has
said.

Here is my view.One way i see this as a good job as we need language support
and on the other side, i see this has , we do not do anything new other than
adding localization support.

I also ask myself, if i have tamil version of each software and if i was
doing business, will i use it?. Immidiately,i get the answer "NO". Adding
localization support may be for personal use and thus Bill states,


"They don't have to wait for a far-distant company to decide whether their
market is big enough or commercially viable. If they need code that meets
their specific needs, they can just write it themselves."


This has to change somehow. An Indian product doesnt mean that it has to
have only Localization in it and unless it is having local language support,
it is not Indian Edition etc., stuffs like that.

India is progressing in BPOs (which i personally dont like) in such heights
but in devloping OSS, we are not to that extent however we try localizing
each software.Localization is one of the ways to make OSS available in India
but not OSS Development.

Think of RedHat,Novell,Xandros - are anybody from India?.When is such a
company/firm where we have an Indian Based (please, its not localization
which tells indian based!) Linux Distribution. Localization should be
options but not the main goal.

We may also have some Commercial OSS(who give code when you buy).We should
not neglect them as they also fit into it.

Do anybody have a list of indian oss tools/apps/softwares ? Not localization
projects but real development projects?

Personal use is different. One reason why computers have found applications
in the smallest villages in China is because of localization. There is a
huge non-geek crowd out there, which needs attention :)

Hope I'm not wrong....

Dear All,

This is article from One world. 

with regards

PRasanna


By Fouad Riaz Bajwa, FOSS Advocate
Copyrights & Copylefts - In search of ICT Software Freedom
http://fossmullah.wordpress.com 
General Secretary, FOSSFP: Free and Open Source Software Foundation of
Pakistan http://www.fossfp.org   

I can still recall the first day at the Kram Expo Centre in Tunis last year
during the World Summit on the Information Society 2006 as I was making
preparations for exhibiting FOSSFP projects in the space allotted to me by
UNDP when I was overwhelmed to see Sunil Abraham, Program Manager of the
International Open Source Network in action as usual but this time he wasn't
alone like the last time he dropped in at the FOSSFP National Free and Open
Source Software Awareness Campaign in Pakistan. He was leading a team of
documentary camera men! I knew the very instant that our Open Source dude
was up to something, and yes, he was covering FOSS related activities and
interviewing the global FOSS Movement members about their struggle to
advocate and promote the usage and adoption of FOSS globally. 

As I was suspecting, Sunil approached me and asked me my availability for a
brief question and answer session with his team, I replied in approval and
after a few hours Sunil had me rushing with him wearing a Media Entry Permit
towards the Media Pavilion of the Kram Expo Centre. I was seated in a small
room with a camera focused on me and a mic hovering right above my head!
Yes, it was my few minutes of fame where I exchanged my views over how the
FOSS movement was taking on in my region and what do we foresee about its
future. I remember the best part, when I actually forgot a word I wanted to
say near the end of the interview shoot and for the first time in my life, I
ordered to the cameraman "CUT!" who shocked by the sudden shout while
catching me on tape, popped up from behind his camera and first shot a
glance full of amazement at me and then towards Sunil who was ultimately
smiling in response to what had just happened. I discussed the word with
Sunil and we dropped the idea of the answer to that particular question with
that particular word I had forgotten and we were back in the shoot and then
yes, it was complete. 

Later during that day and the days to follow, I would see Sunil and his team
running all over the place conducting interviews and the best part of all,
Sunil got footage of Richard Stallman of the Free Software Movement, Bruce
Perens of the Open Source Software Movement, me of course of the Free & Open
Source Software Movement, Molly from Malaysia, FOSSFA from Africa and lots
of more important FOSS people and organizations. I am telling you, the world
is in for a treat of a technological life time. I don't know anything about
the script; I don't know which direction the documentary is going to take
the world towards, I have no idea what a surge the documentary might send in
to the proprietary world but I am definitely sure of one thing, it will
change the way forever how the world perceives Free and Open Source
Software.

Information about the "The Code Breakers" documentary is available on the
BBC website. BBC states that "Microsoft has dominated the world of computing
for many years, with its heavily guarded ?code? being beyond reach to many
in the developing nations. In some of the poorest countries the cost of
upgrading an operating system to keep up with the rest of the world amounts
to a year's wages, and there are few legitimate options. In Thailand for
example, 95 percent of software on computers is pirated. The poorest
countries are now beginning to use free or open source software (FOSS), a
software that parallels many of Microsoft's programmes but with the major
difference being that they are distributed free of charge and can be altered
by computer programmers who are allowed unfettered access to the 'source
code'. In this two-part documentary, Code Breakers includes stories and
interviews from around the world where FOSS is making an impact, from
disaster management in Sri Lanka to tortoise breeding programmes in the
Galapagos."

The schedule for airing "The Code Breakers" documentary by BBC World is:
(Pakistan Standard Time):
11 May 2006: 0030 - The Code Breakers Part 1
18 May 2006: 0030 - The Code Breakers Part 2
GMT:
11 May 2006: 0470 - The Code Breakers Part 1
18 May 2006: 0470 - The Code Breakers Part 2

Another documentary soon to follow after The Code Breakers
This is not the beginning and its definitely not the end, I feel that this
documentary is a message to all the nations of the world, to the corporate
world, to academia, to implicitly and explicitly anyone and everyone that
FOSS is making waves and is here to stay and has revolutionized in to a Open
ICT Software Ecosystem promoting open standards and immense opportunities of
innovation, knowledge development and sharing. I wish I had come up with the
True Spirit of the FOSS Movement back then but once again, it was definitely
the right time when I shared the ideology/philosophy with the world at the
FOSSFA-IDLELO2 Conference February 2006 in Nairobi, Kenya. Thanks to the
inspiration that FOSSFP and FOSSFA share globally and the opportunity for
active participation extended to me by FOSSFA, I presented the ideology and
David Madi? from Eighty Days Productions was there with his documentary crew
to cover the moment in the global FOSS Movement. David and his team are
making an unusual documentary on the FOSS Movement. Madi?'s current film is
a character-driven film that focuses on some of the people involved in the
Free/Libre and Open Source communities [FN]. "Therefore," Madi? says, "as
much as it's a film about FLOSS, it's also a film about fighting for your
beliefs. This film will show the characters fighting for what they believe
in. This happens to be Open Source, which I think is also an important
agenda"[FN].

When Madi? was enquired by the famous voice of the FOSS Movement, Frederick
Noronha that why he had selected such an unusual, maybe unglamorous and
certainly technical, subject? Madi? explained "That's because I used to be
in the IT sector. I once ran a joint-venture company in Uganda and came to
know about an African country like Uganda. I was very ignorant about Africa
-- as many Europeans are -- and I was surprised by the skills and the
talent, and all the modern science of a capital city like Kampala that has
skyscrapers taller than what we have in Copenhagen."

FOSS has not only promoted a philosophy introduced by the software
development world but has also introduced a new way of perception towards
humanity. Whether it is the multimedia work of Mark Shuttleworth's Go-Open
Source Campaign, IOSN or David, the voice of Frederick Noronha or the
advocacy efforts by thousands or maybe millions of FOSS Movement members
worldwide, it only strengthens the movement and grows it bigger and bigger
on a daily basis. Efforts like these will go a long way to mark milestones
in the history of mankind when humans embraced ICT for their sustainable
socio-economical development and embarked upon FOSS, a little flower plant
seeded by Richard Stallman, that budded in to flowers and re-decorated by
Bruce Perens and that were bought by the FOSS Movement as a whole.

The Spirit of the FOSS Movement
This is once again a grand time to celebrate the success of FOSS and share
the true spirit of the global FOSS Movement. The spirit is an ideology that
helps to strengthen the message of the FOSS movement globally. To embrace
the true spirit of FOSS we have to understand how to make a difference in
the world around us:
1. We believe that the software we generate as a result of our thoughts and
actions influences the people around us
2. We think about how we can add to the spirit of life rather than subtract
from it
3. We have the power to change the world around us through software built
under the umbrella of Open Standards and FOSS
4. We should never underestimate or neglect this power of software
5. We should nurture it and help others benefit from this/its true spirit
This FOSS friends and partners in service is the true spirit of the Global
FOSS Movement.

How to join the Global FOSS Movement
1. FOSS is a result of Freedom
2. If you let others decide what software you should use, you are not
seizing your own Freedom
3. You have a choice for adopting software for every situation in your life
4. You can choose software just like your actions and attitudes
Thus
1. You can choose your own Freedom!
2. Your own FOSS!
3. Your own Software!
4. And make a difference!

With knowledge and zeal to achieve the unachievable, by developing and
sharing knowledge for the benefit of humanity, the FOSS Movement will
continue to disrupt the dictatorship of the proprietary software world
leading and march towards an Information Society that embodies the
principles of sharing and open society.

Your mistake is that you consider yourself to be the average Indian.
You, my friend, represent a minority - urban Indians - 30% of the
total. You have had the full 15 or 16 years of education, you can
speak and express yourself clearly in English and you live in a
metropolis where most everyone you come in contact with also speaks
English. 70% of India do not have these opportunities.

A rural French or Spanish farmer has access to all kinds of
information that helps them in farming in their native language. Why
should the Indian farmer be deprived of this kind of help from modern
technology?

That is fine. But l10n is the best way for a fledgling LUG from a
distant minor town to make a difference, to apply their unique
position of being native speakers of a less popular language to the
betterment of their local community. L10n is where LUGs should start,
but I agree with you that it should not be the raison d'etre for the
LUG.

Redhat and Novell both have SDCs in India. I remember a few companies
that had their own distributions too - for example, my ex-employer,
Retort Software - www.retortsoft.com - has a Linux distribution for
the non-IT industries. Several biggies with factories in interior
Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, with corporate offices in
Mumbai and Pune use this distro, Alice, for HO-BO-Factory
communications.

Fred Noronha had created such a list a long time ago - 10 minutes on
Google should help you locate it. From the highly successful Anjuta to
several small .pms on CPAN - Indians have done it all. Dr. Sani of
LUG-Nagpur and Raj Mathur of LUG-Delhi (who is also mentioned in the
original BBC article) have written a lot of PHP and Perl code
respectively for their own businesses, released under the GPL or a
comparable license.

Finally, the world might have found a viable, commercial alternative
to the `Wintel' personal computer, that is based on monopolistic
softwares and the Intel processor. A small Chinese player based in
Macau - Yellow Sheep River (YSR) - has created a PC, tiny in size with
enough computational punch to please most lay users.

It's called the `Municator,' and is based on a 64-bit processor,
`Godson,' designed and manufactured in China. More about YSR at

The Godson processor is based on the MIPS64 (R10K) architecture. Well,
the designers say that it is "95% MIPS". Reminds me of Lexra, a
company that based its processors on the MIPS ISA without paying MIPS
a pie ;-)

By the way, the MIPS patented instructions expire in September this
year and the MIPS R3K design will become free ;-)

Hi,

I'm looking to buy a VIA cpu + motherboard to run Linux.

Can someone who owns this board please comment on the
chipset (particularily network card) and it's linux compatibility.

A post of your dmesg output would be perfect!

Thanks in advance.

First of all, it's not OT, I think...

http://lwn.net/Articles/131777/

Don't know how good the drivers are, though...

On a more general note, as long as you don't shake it about too much, and 
spike protect it, the board itself seems fine from what I've seen (Windows 
machines, unfortunately)

Are the EPIA boards available in india ?
Last I heard, they were available someplace in Delhi and that too at a
premium cost!

Sorry to reply to my own post, but just to clarify, I'm not looking
for the EPIA boards.  Just one of those el-cheapo Rs 2,500 board
+ cpu deals.

When i do fdisk /dev/foo , the driver enters into continous loop in the

 <!--  Hi all,

I have created livecd using cloop compression mechanism and the root file system what i have taken for livecd there USB is working fine its automatically mounting and opening in browser but when i created Livecd out of that file system then automounting is not working....


what may be the problem-->
   
   
 I got a solution for this.Actually my root file system is mounted on /UNIONFS directory so udev an pmount were checking in /dev and changed to /UNIONFS/dev so its mounting now.BUT as i told u desktop icon is not coming.
   
   
 I have set up gnome-volume-manager, and when I plug a USB drive in, it gets mounted (generally at /media/USB DISK), and a nautilus window pops up, showing it. However, no desktop icon is created, and so I cannot find how to umount it, short of running the 'umount /dev/sdwhatever' command, but I would prefer a GUI way. The panel mounter thing doesn't seem to recognise the USB disk. 
  
Can someone help me find out why the icon is not being created and/or how to umount it without an icon? Even I checked configuation editor .There volumes_visible is checked and other hardisk partitions mounting and desktop icon is visible on desktop (becuase they have entry in /etc/fstab) USB is mounting without /etc/fstab entry so how can i do that?????????????

1. Store account information in a database. LDAP is eminently suitable for this.
2. Hash your mail spool directories. The last time I did this, I had
mail spools in /home/mailspool/b/i/binand (two-level hashing).
3. Use a scalable and feature rich mail server software. I had used
Courier and would swear by it. Supports LDAP out of the box.
4. Make sure you have big enough and separate spool and queue partitions.

In RDBMS or Binand's Hashing methods, How the standard login/mta prgs
will check for the user. Will use any specific PAM Modules?

Any reference links to learn more about this kind of approch ?

Parsing and lookup of large text files (/etc/passwd and friends) is very
inefficient.  *BSD maintains passwd information in a Berkeley hashes
for fast access.  OpenLDAP uses bdb or an RDBMS on the back end.

The other option is to run a "blackbox mail server", i.e. one where
you don't want to provide shell access to all email user accounts,
see the Cyrus suite.  You don't need to add all users to your mail
server.

Cyrus IMAP requires you to create only a single cyrus unix
account for the daemons, and all mail accounts are internally
managed by cyrus.  For authentication, Cyrus uses SASL which
you can plug into PAM, LDAP or other backends.

The MTA will also need to use the same SASL auth for account
information and LMTP for local delivery.

If you are running Debian Sarge, the entire thing is fairly painless
to setup.  Contact me if you need the config files.

Cyrus comes with excellent documentation, and is typically well
suited for setting up massive mail servers.  Carnegie Mellon Uni
(the creators of Cyrus) host ~35,000 accounts on their servers.

For me, the killer features of Cyrus are:
1.  Seive -- a procmail like mail filter engine
2.  Squatter -- a text indexing engine that allows you to do *very fast*
    searches through your mail boxes.  Brings Gmail like functionality
    to Thunderbird.  Full text searches through my server with ~15GB
    mailboxes takes ~10s.
3.  Great scalability -- scales within a single box and also in clusters.

MTAs don't usually care about delivery of mails to mailboxes. MTA's
job is to accept emails meant for domains it consider it ought to, and
then decide what to do with the email. It could do one of two basic
things:

a. It could hand over the mail to another MTA elsewhere (usually via
RFC2822 SMTP protocol), or
b. Pass the mail to a program called MDA (Mail Delivery Agent).

In the most usual configuration I have seen on Linux distros, the MTA
is Sendmail and the MDA is Procmail.

So, your question really is how the MDA will know where to deliver the
mail. Taking the example of Sendmail+Procmail further, Procmail has
the /var/spool/mail/<recipient> location hardcoded in it - this is the
default location where it will deliver the message. As with anything
else on Unix, you can configure Procmail to do what you want by giving
it instructions via /etc/procmailrc.

Sendmail invokes Procmail with the -d <recipient> option. Sendmail
derives <recipient> from the envelope recipient address (this is not
the To: address in the email), by stripping the @domain.tld part off.
Without any further instructions, Procmail will deliver the email to
/var/spool/mail/<recipient> location.

So, if you have a program that performs like this:

shell$ myprog binand
/var/mailspool/b/i/binand

Then you can have an /etc/procmailrc like:

DEFAULT=`myprog $LOGNAME`

and procmail will happily deliver to /var/mailspool/b/i/binand.

There is a lot of performance penalty for this approach. Each email
will cause a procmail process to be spawned - you don't want that on a
busy mail server. This is where Courier helps - its MDA, maildrop, has
an embedded mode that can be used if the MTA is Courier. It
understands virtual hosting out of the box, and is really painless to
setup.

Where is LDAP in all this? Procmail performs a setuid() to <recipient>
- your local NSS configuration comes into play when it does this. If
Procmail cannot look up a local user from your preferred NSS database,
then it will bounce the email.

Look at what local mailers are configured in your sendmail.cf - look
for lines that begin with M.

Cyrus provides you with only POP and IMAP servers. You still need to
have a compatible MTA and integrate the two yourself. On the other
hand, Courier comes with an MTA, POP/IMAP servers, a webmail client
and virtual hosting out of the box.

Courier MTA requires you to create only a single courier Unix account
for the daemons, and all mail accounts are internally managed by
Courier. For authentication, Courier uses Courier-authlib which you
can plug into PAM, LDAP, MySQL, Postgres, Userdb (a Berkeley-DB based
system), and even your custom authentication modules via something
called authpipe.

This is where Courier scores. The MTA uses the same Courier-authlib
and hence the whole setup works out of the box.

If you are running any POSIX-compliant operating system, setting up
Courier is painless too. Detailed installation information is
available at http://www.courier-mta.org.

Courier comes with excellent documentation, and is quite common among
IMAP providers. Softhome.net runs on Courier.

I have only used the Courier IMAP server and not the MTA/POP/etc.
and would love to hear you rate the MTA, webmail, etc. against well
known peers like Postfix/Exim, Squirrel Mail, etc.

I was always amazed at how easily courier-imap installed on my
debian dubbas.  This alone made it my fav imap server for ages,
and for many situations, it still remains my favourite.


However, I really like the MH format for its speed and concurrent
access.  Cyrus squatter and Thunderbird saved search folders can
get you really close to the Gmail experience.


Does Courier do shared IMAP folders too?  With independent ACLs
for different users?  IMO shared mail folders are an absolute necessity
with most offices (eg. a group of people handling support@foo.com,
or sales@foo.com type email accounts).

The single biggest advantage of Courier is that it has all the bits
and pieces you need for an enterprise mailing system. With the
alternatives like Exim or Postfix, you still need to pick a POP/IMAP
server, meddle with various configuration files to integrate the two,
do the whole thing again if you need to add a webmail system and so
on.

Having said that, I'll try to list some of the common features that
Courier has. You can check and see if your $MTA has all these.

Spam Control:
1. Backscatter bounce suppression.
2. Easy integration with DNS-based blacklists like Spamhaus etc.
3. "Freemail" settings (eg: mail from @yahoo.com should originate from
an IP with a .yahoo.com rDNS entry)
4. SPF support out of the box

Virtual (mail-only) User Support:
1. Virtual user databases can be in MySQL, Postgres, LDAP (someone
reported success with Microsoft AD), flat files, system databases via
PAM etc.
2. Consistent authentication framework via courier-authlib
3. If using authuserdb, you can restrict users to POP-only,
webmail-only, IMAP-only or any combination of these

Filtering:
1. Maildrop - Procmail replacement with a nice filtering language of its own
2. Embedded mode when maildrop is running within a Courier esmtp listener
3. Courierfilter framework for 3rd-party filters (much like
Sendmail-Milter). Filters exist for popular antispam/antivirus like
Spamassassin, ClamAV etc. Filters can be written in C, perl or more
recently, python.

Webmail:
1. Basic webmail features, not as feature-rich as some others
2. Includes basic personal or groupware calendaring.
3. LDAP-aware
4. Client-server model, small cgi stub as client and a sqwebmaild
daemon as server.
5. GnuPG and Aspell aware
6. Maildrop filters can be written from the webmail UI.

IMAP/POP:

1. Support for IMAP acls (I think experimental)
2. Integrated IMAP/POP3 proxy
3. Shared folder support
4. imaps and pop3s support

Other:

1. ESMTP extensions - STARTTLS, VERP, SIZE, PIPELINING, DSN etc.
2. Integrated mailing list manager - couriermlm
3. RFC 2476 support
4. IPv6 support
5. uucp support
6. mail-fax and fax-mail support
7. SMTP AUTH support out of the box.
8. Web-based configuration tool which can configure all these subsystems
9. Partial support for Sendmail style and Qmail style aliasing (.qmail
support too!)
10. Maildir++. Non-filesystem quotas on mailboxes (needed for virtual hosting)
11. Client and server for SMAP, an experimental protocol for IMAP
replacement. The client is called Cone. Cone also does most everything
that a decent console mail client should do.
12. Secure and actively developed.

It does. But this is really the job of a ticketing system like RT
(www.bestpractical.com/rt)

Careful with that axe - unless you are really sure that email from a 
particular freemail does originate with that particular rDNS (see where 
email from lycos.com orgiinates for example)

That was a list of features in Courier - doesn't necessarily mean I

Hi,

               I have set up gnome-volume-manager, and when I plug a USB drive in, it gets mounted (generally at /media/USB DISK), and a nautilus window pops up, showing it. However, no desktop icon is created, and so I cannot find how to umount it, short of running the 'umount /dev/sdwhatever' command, but I would prefer a GUI way. The panel mounter thing doesn't seem to recognise the USB disk. 
  
Can someone help me find out why the icon is not being created and/or how to umount it without an icon? Even I checked configuation editor .There volumes_visible is checked and other hardisk partitions mounting and desktop icon is visible on desktop (becuase they have entry in /etc/fstab) USB is mounting without /etc/fstab entry so how can i do that?????????????
  
 Thanks.

You have a Systems or Computer Icon on your desktop, click it. A 
nautilus window will open showing your hard disks, floppy and CD drives. 
When you have plugged in the USB drive, it will also show your USB drive 
there. You can right click and select unmount.

I don't remeber much, but there was some GNOME option to select the 
conditions for which an icon should be displayed on the desktop, like 
"mounted CD drive", "unmounted CD drive", etc. which also had show icons 
for USB drives when they are mounted, over the desktop. I am sorry that 
I couldn't figure out where I saw those options :(

Message-ID: <7bf1bec50605180243g7981711ejd7e56252ee7c0fa4@mail.gmail.com>

I think most (if not all) mail servers deliver multiple copies of mail
addressed (cc'ed) to many mail ids on the same domain. Or at least the local
MDA places multiple copies of a cc'ed mail (within the same domain) in the
different mailboxes. Are there MDAs that hold all mails (only one copy of
each) in one single place and only track the user ids that are to receive
the mails? I think Zimbra follows this approach.

About 2-3MB of attachments get mailed to all users in our company (150
users) everyday. That uses up about 300-500MB of disk space every day! Right
now it is not a critical issue because user desktops have pop3 mail clients
which download mails and remove it from the server. But what if we want to
provide only web mail access! We dont want to be storing redundant copies
then.

Are there options out there which already solve this problem (other than
Zimbra)? Or do popular MDAs support this option via a config file and only I
have missed it? Or are there other critical issues this approach will raise?

Thanks,
mano

Mails to both the servers come to first server (A) and if the user is

Now I want to relay the mails for users that are not locally available

In a corporate scenario, anyone planning a mail server deployment
should plan for between 3-10GB of space per user, and 5 times that for
backups. Disk space is cheap.

Have the users mapped (inside postfix's config) to user@intmail and 
user@extmail respectively for the internal and external

You can forward mail appropriately that way

But why waste space when there is an opportunity to optimize! Even more
important - what if I want all my mails indexed so it is easy to search
(perhaps using lucene). Indexing multiple copies of the same mail again and
again is a monumental waste!

Leaving out arguments about cheap disk space and CPU cycles, it just does
not seem to be an elegant solution. Why is this so? Are there any hurdles to
the one copy per mail approach - that others know of but Zimbra has
apparently missed!

What harm did I do to you?  Why should you punish me by giving my
email address now to this earthscreen? :(

Next time you  give out your gmail password  to some random site,
please  stop  for  a  minute  and  think  about  the  devastating
consquences it can have on your privacy and comfort.

Is that a question for some sort of a viva-voce?

anyway, the  equivalent of 'supervisor' in unix  is 'root'.  When
logged in as 'root' you can do a lot more damage (like typing "rm
-rf  / tmp/*").  But  then there  need not  be just  one absolute
supervisor.   You  can  setup  multiple supervisors  for  various
services on your  machine (mail, web server, etc.,.)  all by just
playing with the permissions and ownerships.

I had actually written quite a lot more than quoted above; which I
deleted prior to sending. So, here goes, once again...

It is not sufficient that the MDA supports such a feature; the
POP/IMAP/Webmail/whatever clients should support it too. Now, all of
these should come to an understanding as to how to store a given
email's state for each intended recipient - Seen, Deleted, Forwarded,
Replied to etc. Further, there are "minor" details like allowing each
recipient to delete any of the attachments or any combination of them
(implemented by clients by downloading the message, editing it, and
uploading a new copy), allowing each recipient to deal with
disposition notifications ("read receipts") and so on, you can imagine
how complex this can become.

Now, it is OK if the IMAP server supports the feature - as webmail
clients usually hook into an IMAP server, and POP3 doesn't have
server-side processing of emails. I know that the popular ones - UW,
Courier and Cyrus - do not support any such feature (but as Suresh
pointed out, MS Exchange does). I imagine the reason is that such a
mail store requirement hasn't caused an itch to anyone willing to
scratch it so far. :)

There are some FOSS mailstores that feed into a database .. one of these 
might do something similar, not sure.

It is a great feature to have in groupware messaging, where the same 
document can and will routinely get received and edited by different people.

Cyrus supports this, see the "single-instance store" feature.

Of course, groupware software like Lotus Domino and Groupwise already
implement this, for precisely this reason. Microsoft Exchange doesn't,
but Microsoft Office has a "review" feature which implements this
feature in a different way.

Message-ID: <c4c6746f0605180930g38eeb5dgf3236e50cfc73442@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I had been using SUSE 10.0 for about two months until I got hold of
FC5 from LFY DVD in May '06 Issue.
Had successfully installed, but have a problem in accessing my Other
HDD which contains the  Data  in ReiserFS  partition created by SUSE
10.0.

The first HDD is fully devoted to FC5, where I had reformatted and
installed FC5 (earlier SUSE 10.0 was here).
The second HDD is only for Data but the file system is  ReiserFS
created using SUSE 10.0

My Current FSTAB in FC 5 is as follows:
LABEL=/1                /                       ext3    defaults        1 1
/dev/hdc7               /Backup                 reiserfs defaults        1 2
/dev/hdc6               /FC5_Data               reiserfs defaults        1 2
devpts                  /dev/pts                devpts  gid=5,mode=620  0 0

proc                    /proc                   proc    defaults        0 0
sysfs                   /sys                    sysfs   defaults        0 0
LABEL=SWAP-sda5         swap                    swap    defaults        0 0
/dev/hdc5               swap                    swap    defaults        0 0

Any pointers as why I am not able to read the HDC6 & HDC7 Partition.

Any error messages? Also, post the output (or at least, the relavent portions

This is apparently caused by his giving his gmail password to that 
earthscreen site. The earthscreen site then logs into his gmail account 
and sends this out to everybody in his address book.

I would suggest at least a temporary suspension of people who send this 
to the list.

Thanks, all of you.

Summarizing, what is needed is an IMAP server which speaks lmtp with the MTA
(as per the cyrus link that Raja Subramanian sent) and imap with its clients
but handles the complexity involved (as pointed to by Binand) all by itself.

When I want to index mails then the itch is irritable enough to want to
scratch :-) Will keep you posted if I get to scratch it.

Thanks

See Cyrus Squatter.  It builds indexes of your mailboxes on the server
side and any IMAP client that can perform server side search
(Thunderbird) can use it.

Squatter is very fast - full text search of ~15GB of mail takes < 10s.
The indexes typically use up 1-3% of disk space.

Searching for 'single instance message store' led me to this:

http://www.peterdehaas.com/2005/12/exchange_single.html

So recovery will cause problems. So will handling large files. But would it
not be solved by using a db engine?

Nothing on the face of it, so did you wait for 1 hour before checking your /tmp?

Hey All,

I have a web server set up with several IP addresses at my web host 
(virtual ones / all in one eth card). Let's say the main IP is 
xx.xx.xx.100 and we have a site using the xx.xx.xx.101 IP on the same 
machine.

The mail sent from the server (like, by scripts running on the server) 
uses the IP xx.xx.xx.100 while the domain is actually xx.xx.xx.101, so 
some mail gets rejected (by AOL, for instance) because the IP the mail 
was sent from does not match the domain.

So, do I just add another A record pointing the domain to xx.xx.xx.100? 
Or is that not right?

Thanks in advance,
-Mani

Thats not the reason why AOL rejects email

Your server on that IP seemed to have been hacked - the last time you 
posted to the list asking about it

What error does AOL return?  There'll be a URL under 
http://postmaster.info.aol.com that gives you a detailed reason for this 
and contact information

I guess you want AOL to block more IPs?

These are times when you want to obfuscate even your email ID so that it is
not machine readable easily but you still went ahead and even gave your
password!!

Just curious..... what motivates you to part with your email ID _AND_
password to an unknown site!!

Freebie's usually. Some sort of referral scheme.

much much worse than e-mail phishing as the person himself is volunteering.

No - did you give earthscreen.net - that website - your gmail password?

CNN interviews Linus Torvalds in the "Global Office" program.

Saturday 1pm repeat at 7pm
Sunday 5pm, repeat at 11pm

http://edition.cnn.com/2006/BUSINESS/05/18/global.office.linustorvalds/

I remember the last time CNN interviewed him - that was in 1999, and he
used the "panties" analogy there as well :) We actually screened that
interview at the Linux Pavilion of Bangalore IT.COM 1999, and it was a
riot.

Linus is always fun to listen to, so tune in.

Message-ID: <92f9a9560605191220y42e7aec7gd27e0106e0a54dca@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm curious as to how your organise, store, retrieve personal
information computers.  Do you use a special Personal Information
Manager, TODO list, or combination of various tools that helps you
organise the daily information overload?

I've attempted everything from storing information in mailboxes
(locally and on gmail), Mozilla Scrapbook, storing information in
local files/folders (with full text search), contemplating the use
of an outlining editor such as leo
    http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html
and even considered knowledge webs and topic maps.


The ideal software I'm looking at should allow me to:

1. store a prioritized todo list and daily planner
2. store all information gleaned from mailing lists, web pages, etc.
3. store random thoughts and information that I create
4. do simple project management
5. offer flexible of categorizing and searching of data

Any suggestions?

- Raja

You did something stupid, which also happened to annoy several people.
This was brought to you in a rather hard way, no doubt.

Rather than claim that booting you off temporarily is a bad idea, and call
me names, a wiser course of action is to learn from your mistake, feel
some remorse for irritating others, apologise and move on.

Message-ID: <446EA0B9.7000800@gmail.com>

Hi LUGies,

For the past 10 days I am finding out an odd stuff with my boradband 
connection at home. After a couple of hours of browsing, when I 
eventually stop using the internet further by large amount, I see my 
netwrok being used by some 40-60% continuously. Eevn when I am not using 
Gaim, Firefox and Thunderbird, there is data transfer happening in my 
connection. Am not using any other services which may automatically make 
use of the connection. I tried even switching off the apt and yum from 
the list of services.Even though my actual utilization is less than 15MB 
per day, for the past 10 days I have been losing around 40-120 MB per 
day. In this rate my limit of 1GB may get used up within 10 days :(

How to find which service is using my bandwidth ? any tools ? How to put 
an end to this?

I use FC4 and have a BSNL Data one connection 500 Plan and a ADSL 
Ethernet modem given by them. I don't automatically connect when the 
system boots up, I manually if-up it.

do a netstat or two and see whats going on

are you running any p2p software?  or a badly configured squid proxy 
thats being abused?  or is there a windows PC also on your home network 
that may have a virus that's spamming out through your connection?

I like this simple, open hearted interview from Linus. You can notice
one thing. Most of the successfull corporate heads, use to say that
they had a vision, they planned such a way to accomplish, it is all
because of their effort to reach the current position.......... they
will try to show that they had enough intelligence to come to this
position, they had cleverly planned for this success...... But I don't
think that it is so, in many cases. Linus's following answer seems to
be more practical on this.

KLS: Is there anything else you want to accomplish going forward?

LT: No, but on the other hand I am not the kind of person that really
plans ahead a lot. When I started Linux it wasn't because I wanted to
be where I am today. I am more of an "everyday as it comes" type of
person. I am very happy that I feel like I do something meaningful,
that has made a difference, that actually a lot of people use. But at
the same time I don't have and I never have had any big visionary
goals.

btw: Anybody has read "An accidental revolution - biography of Linux
Torvalds" - it is very interesting bood to read.

I use Flock [http://www.flock.com] as my primary web browser that has a 
"Shelf" where I can put on things that I would like to review/read later 
and/or add notes to it.

I use Thunderbird as my primary e-mail, calendar (I have built 
Thunderbird with Lightning extension), task manager (same as previous), 
and RSS reader.

As for flexible categorizing and searching of data, Flock can associate 
tags with your history and bookmarks and also since the bookmarks can be 
integrated with del.icio.us/shadows.com, I can access my bookmarks 
anywhere ;)

never ask why bots do things. they are looking for idiots who allow 
root login on sshd with easy passwords - after getting in, they can

Phew. Look at (GNU|X)Emacs, instead. It does all that you want, and
you even get a text editor thrown in. :)

[copying again, since there was some error previously, apologies if you 
are receiving this for the second time]

I use Flock [http://www.flock.com] as my primary web browser that has a 
"Shelf" where I can put on things that I would like to review/read later 
and/or add notes to it.

I use Thunderbird as my primary e-mail, calendar (I have built 
Thunderbird with Lightning extension), task manager (same as previous), 
and RSS reader.

As for flexible categorizing and searching of data, Flock can associate 
tags with your history and bookmarks and also since the bookmarks can be 
integrated with del.icio.us/shadows.com, I can access my bookmarks 
anywhere ;)

Hey..
is suse 10.1 working fine for you? I mean, during installation it failed to
detect my monitor and graphics card(i845) ; and after installation it
generated an incomplete xorg.conf which failed to boot to X. Now i've got X
working manually, but the "Graphics Card and monitor" module of yast fails
to load.
Also, could you let me know about any good repo for suse yum or smart...
yast package management is just too slow..

thanx.

Can't seem to apt-get install on my box.  Where can I download one? :-P

Seriously, in my case, I don't think a secretary is of much help.  They are
great for administrative and clerical duties (which I don't seem to have a
problem with as I've already outsourced most of my administrivia :-)

Even if I dump all this information on a secretary, then he/she will soon
be asking the same question on this list.

Perhaps I should deeper into lifehacker.com or 43folders.com.  For now,
I'll bite the bullet and try Leo one more time as it's the closest thing
to what I want.

Thanks to everyone for their suggestions.

Hi,

Yesterday i installed fc5 on my ibm thinkpad r40e. in thinkpad the
trackpoint is not working well.   In the sense that however i adjust
the sensivity or speed of the mouse, I had to move the trackpoint hard
to get it going.
Second, will installing fc5 remove the hidden partition which ibm
maintains in HDD. I gave the option remove all partition & install
default layout during installtion

You know something?  If you ask it to remove all partitions, that's just 
what it will do!

Hello LUGies,

With reference to my previous mail and the responses some of our
friends gave, I did a netstat and have posted the outputs in pastebin.

here are the links for the nestat output taken at an interval of 20
mins. I have turned off services like ssd, apt and yum. Still, there
is a consumption of .1 to .2 KB. I f anyone could throw further lights
on this issue, I will be thankful. :)

- I understand that it was irrating. It was purely unintentional. You should
also understand that people get irrated when you call them mindless just
because they make one mistake.





Apologies for  what? I don't think I am mindless for making one mistake. You
don't have to tell me to learn from my mistake. And think twice before
calling people mindless.

Message-ID: <a0c4f6270605202129x3c7e9dcdicc95fad8d92e3db0@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ILUGC,

I have managed to get autofs and automount going, with a timeout of
one second, as it is only for a removable device. I run the automount
command myself as

automount -t 1 /auto file /etc/auto.misc

from rc.local.

Now, the problem with this setup is that unless I manually look up the
mount point, I don't see it. The automounting HOWTO suggests creation
of symbolic links or editing the configurations (where are they?) to
work around this. I was wondering if someone has got a more elegant
solution. This isn't too important, but would be nice.

Thanks.

Kumar

Hi Raja,
            I'm out of town, and I don't have the boards in front of
me, but I've used a pair of Socket-370 Biostar M6VLA with a
Via C3/733 for about 4 years. They ran RH 7.3 quite nicely,
but there were issues with GCC 3.x and the Via C3 - which
are probably fixed in GCC 4.x. It's quite a nice combo, if
you can get hold of them. Funnily enough, you can get an
Intel Tualatin Celeron 1.2 GHz + i810e motherboard for less
money today - about Rs.2k. The Tualerons utterly dominate
the low end - they're about equivalent to a Northwood Celeron
2.60 GHz on typical integer/pointer code found on GNU/Linux
boxes.

    The main issue with all the low-end P3/P4 boards is poor
quality Chinese/Taiwanese electrolytics which invariably
burst within a year. I work around this issue by replacing all
the electrolytics with high-quality Japanese electrolytics
of which I have a dwindling hoard. They're probably good
for 10-20 years of continuous operation with Panasonic
FC/FK/FM, Nichicon Px series, Chemicon LXZ/KZG or
similar - all of which are quite hard to find locally.

   If you want a reliable combination that works out-of-the-box,
go with a PowerColor A300M (Socket-478, ATI Radeon 300)
and a Prescott Celeron 2.26 GHz for a total of about Rs.5k,
or a Sempron-64/2500+ and just about any Socket-754 board
for about the same price.

   About Rs.10k gets you an ATI Socket-775 board + Intel
Pentium D 805 + 512 MB of DDR2. That's a pretty good
deal for a dual-core P4 that overclocks to 4.1 GHz out of
the box.

Are you trying to use autofs for getting a usb device mounted whenever
it is plugged in? I would suggest that you use gnome-volume-manager
(if u need icons and other gui stuff) or usbmount (more bare bones).
AFAIK autofs is not meant for this.

it moves on...

The machine I am using is Slackware 10.2, kernel 2.4.31. No GNOME.

And, autofs works just fine with all USB devices I am bothered about,
so I guess I wouldn't need anything else. I do not have usbmount. Do
check the Automounting mini HOWTO, autofs is certainly *one* of the
ways to get this done, though there may be newer and better ways.

Thanks.

That is some cheek. You first of all do something hopelessly idiotic,
pissing off the entire list population in the process, then try to
justify yourself and finally threaten others for pointing out your
goofups.

That is good enough for my killfile.

You have to enable complex script in firefox. The workaround is just
adding "MOZ_ENABLE_PANGO=1" in /etc/mozilla-firefox/mozilla-firefoxrc
(this file may be available in your firefox installation directory
also). This will work if firefox is built with complex script support
but not enabled by default.

i agree with you. to check that whether u r browser is built with
pango support, type about:buildconfig in the address bar and see the
config text. if u find enable-pango, that means your firefox is built
with pango support.

i have the latest build of firefox 2 alpha release (bon echo) with
indic support for linux version.

When you want to try something new, you are bound to make mistakes. It is
alright.

But, when someone points out a mistake, you either accept it or decline it.

If you choose to decline it,  debate on why & how you are right.
If you choose to accept, gently apologize. else at least keep quiet .

You can not accept it as a mistake and then debate on it.
Only mindless stupids do this.

Hi LUG,

I would like to know is there any open source shell script editor available for windows os?
You may surprise why I need the editor for Windows, I am using Cygwin tool for executing unix shell script on windows platform.
vi editor that comes with cygwin is not user friendly.

Also, i wud like to know how the script files can be made as an EXE file? i.e. code should not be available for reading/editing?

Thanks and Regards,

  You have to enable complex script in firefox. The workaround is just
  adding "MOZ_ENABLE_PANGO=1" in /etc/mozilla-firefox/mozilla-firefoxrc
  (this file may be available in your firefox installation directory
  also). This will work if firefox is built with complex script support
  but not enabled by default.

  i agree with you. to check that whether u r browser is built with
  pango support, type about:buildconfig in the address bar and see the
  config text. if u find enable-pango, that means your firefox is built
  with pango support.

  i have the latest build of firefox 2 alpha release (bon echo) with
  indic support for linux version.

Yes, it is called Emacs [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/].

I don't think it would be possible to convert a shell procedure to a 
Unix executable.  But why do you need this? ;)

If you are  using Cygwin, you can use just  about any editor that
compiles under cygwin.  You can  also find win32 ports. I run GNU
Emacs when I have to use windows.

You cannot. If  your only goal is to  prevent readability you can
set the file permissions to grant no readable access:

chmod -r-w+x script.sh

or you can use a utility like shc that encrypts the file:

http://aplawrence.com/Linux/shc.html

But, why do you need  unreadability of your scripts?  If the only
reason you are trying to  prevent readability is because you have
some  sort of  a 'password'  embedded  in your  script, then  you
should seriously think about re-designing your system. Also, note
that,  making your  code executable  doesn't prevent  people from
simply  running  strings on  the  executable  and getting  secret
strings, if any.

Cheers,

Please don't quote the entire digest. If you want to ask a question on

I personally prefer the Win32 version of Vim, downloadable from www.vim.org.

Unfortunately, shebang scripts require to be readable by the user
executing them :)

SHC prevents that, too. But I agree that the design decision that
mandates such unreadable shell scripts are suspect and ought to be
re-thought.

actually you should not have replied to this part - we frown on

well... only mildly. if the op's aim to hide a password or something,
this might give a false sense of security!

from the web page:

<quote>

In the October 2005 Linux Journal, Nalneesh Guar reports that he was
able to break the encryption very easily. The man page seems to agree:

 You can use it if you wish to distribute your scripts
 but don't want them to be easily readable by other people.

Note 'easily'. As the old saying goes, locks keep out honest people.
In a typical office, this might be all you need to prevent casual
observation or modification of scripts, and could be useful for that.

why dont we block the mails with this subject. ( by some filters at the
server )
Because , i feel , removing a user should only be the last resort.

Already discussed this idea. But It seems to be bit difficult(!?) to
implement in mailman. Thats why dropped.

We came across one situation. One script is used to parse the log file
and generate reports. An enthu field guy saw the code and took a copy
and modified it.

He used the modified script to generate the reports. That was the
disaster. Bcoz he commented an important step, which is used only by
developer to some specific debugging. It took a week to find that.

So sometime it is needed and is nothing to do with secrete or hiding
of the code. :)

the solution to this is certainly not hiding the code. Proper 
policies should be in place regarding access to production servers 
and testing code before putting it into production.

Whoa. Hang on...

1. Enthu guys, just because they are enthu, shouldn't be allowed on
production boxes. Access to production boxes should be carefully
controlled. You need an access control policy.
2. They certainly should not be able to edit stuff on those production
boxes. They should be editing scripts on workstations, checking their
changes into a version control system, testing their modifications on
test data and only then deploying them on production systems.
3. Debugging code, when commented out, should not cause such a major
mess. The presence or absence of debugging code should not alter the
behaviour of any program in any way.

You should not choose SHC to overcome these gaps in your internal
processes. These gaps will certainly make themselves conspicuous
another day, with probably far more disastrous consequences.

No. I object moderation very strongly. Then this mailing list which I admire
very much will become very similar to one of mailing lists that I dont like.
I guess its much simpler to click the 'delete' button rather than click on
'reply'  and type some words.. :)
Will people stop flaming other people please. A sincere request..
'STOP'

no and again no - peer pressure is needed. Better than banning 
spammers, if enough group members send individual mails to the 
offending members, they will rectify themselves. This particular 
spam is more due to stupidity and greed than to malice

I have been receiving these mails not only from ilugc mailling list,
but also from other sources. As can be seen, the intension on part
of the 'offending' sender was honest, but the fallout was inadvertent.

I have placed a filter in gmail, for all mails with subject line as
"Let's make a difference". Works for all sources :)

Please do know that am building separately for Yoper, so no matter what
other distros provide,i cannot use it Yoper. I need a better way on
compiling each component of kdebase. I was discussing this on #kde-devel and
i have not received any help on this.

I have moved to gdm, but even that is also giving troubles(but not as
KDM)...

the compilation stops by telilng this,

*db2omf:Missing revision element in revHistory*
 *db2omf:Missing revnumber element in revHistory*

i am not sure whether this is error or not.

Note: Am building Yoper Xfce based ISO, and am going to have GDM as my
Display Manager.

Thank You.

I found myself using ReiserFs thanks to all the good reviews about it
recently(not the old ones). So I installed ReiserFS v3.6 on my PC (ArchLinux
is my distro). Now reiser4 has been released and it seems to have better
features. I have a sigular yes/no question, is Reiser v3 upgradable to V4
without reformatting( i use a single partition /  so i cvant reformat my
/home or /usr separately mirroring them to some other partition)

Hey,

I have an IBM Thinkpad R51 and am planning to install gentoo on it. Does 
anyone here have experience getting hibernate to memory working with it ? 
I'm not talking about swsuspend, but the echo -n mem > /proc/power/state 
variety.

Thanks.

Sorry to disturb again. One system with RHWS 3 is not working. we get the error message 
drm:i830_wait-ring] *Error*space:131056 wanted 131064
drm:i830_wait-ring] *Error*Lookup
In Forum search they advise to use the recovery CD. We are still trying to get the CDs from HCL. 
When we report this problem to HCL he said he will support only windows
(don't know what support they will give). The response from them is very poor and the sys. 
is down for more than 5 days.
Is there any thing we can do to solve this problem.

If you got those boxes with RHEL WS pre-installed, then you are
entitled to support, whether HCL likes it or not. It might be from
HCL, or it might be from Redhat.

You might want to give your lawyers a call too.

Is it intel i8?? chipset video?. 
1.This may be ram problem - run memtest
2.Check up disk space in / partition. Run fsck once on /. For me,
once, when the disk space was full similar message came. Freeing the
disk space corrected it.
3.Check your setting of video ram in bios - try to increase it.

Hazmat Suits Greet Microsoft Developers As They Gather For Annual
Conference

To schedule an interview about the campaign or for more details about
the event, please contact Ted Teah at the Free Software Foundation (+1
617-542-5942 x20) or Henri Poole at Civic Actions (+1 510-684-3180).

Seattle, May 23 2006

As Microsoft developers gathered in Seattle to hear Bill Gates's
keynote speech on the future of Microsoft and the coming release of
its updated operating system Vista, protesters wearing bright yellow
Hazmat suits swarmed the entrance of the city's convention center,
delivering an unsettling message to the corporation: your product is
defective and hazardous to users.

The surprise protest marked the launch of DefectiveByDesign.org, a
direct-action campaign that will target Big Media and corporations
peddling Digital Restrictions Management (DRM). "Flash protests,
direct actions, and practical ways that people can get involved and
help stop the stupidity of DRM," is how campaign manager Gregory
Heller described the grassroots effort.

An initiative of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), Defective By
Design is urging all technologists to get involved at the start of the
campaign. "Technologists are very aware of the dangers of DRM," said
Peter Brown, Executive Director of the FSF. "We see this as the tip of
the iceberg and it is our duty to do something about it." The tech
community is uniquely qualified to lead this effort, in Brown's view.
"We know about the collusion of Big Media, device manufacturers and
proprietary software companies to lock us down," he continued. "Their
aim is to put Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) into all our
computers and homes".

Brown's case is simple: the computers, high-definition screens,
phones, music players and video players that are currently being sold
are "defective by design". These products don't respect the user's
right to make private copies of their digital media. These devices
make no provision that would allow art, literature, music or film to
ever fall into the public domain. Effectively, the media purchased for
these devices does not belong to the user -- rather, the networking of
these DRM'd devices means that as the user watches a film, reads an
e-book or switches channels on their HDTV, their habits can be
recorded and actions monitored. The result is that over time, DRM
technology will negate, if not completely eliminate, the rights of the
individual.

"In any other industry, such limitations or invasions would be
considered major flaws. A media player that restricts what you can
play is like a car that you won't let you steer," said Brown.
"Products containing DRM are defective -- only, unlike other products,
these defects are deliberately created by an industry that has long
stopped caring about us."

With DRM in place, media conglomerates can change the rules whenever
they want, leading to more restrictions on the individual.

"Media bosses scream 'pirate' equating sharing with murder and kidnap,
then sue our college students. They then steal our rights and impose
crippled products upon us," said Henri Poole, Chairman of CivicActions
and a coalition partner in the campaign. "Media bosses have long been
the 'gatekeepers to the market' for artists. Now they are threatened
by new distribution methods that give artists new freedoms and direct
access to an audience. DRM is the media bosses attempt to re-impose
their rule".

Today's event is the first in a series planned by
DefectiveByDesign.org that will mobilize individuals to make a stand
against DRM.

Message-ID: <06d701c67ef5$d1318a90$6801000a@chennai.ptg.in>

Hi All,
Is there any way to run Bash shell scripts from a browser passed through Apache.
This is exactly like executing a perl script through mod_perl module.

E.g.
http://myhost/dir1/myscript.sh

If we hit the link,the script should be executed and I have written the script in a way that it outputs a HTML page, that should be displayed in the browser.


Thanks and Regards,

You're exposing yourself to a ton of rootkits

What is stopping you from doing what you need to do with perl or php?

Surprised that you know about the mod_perl module but not about the
mod_cgi module.

do u want to modify the current URL (u have to change window.location
then) or the hyperlinks (document.links)... GreaseMonkey is usually
used for such purposes. That's an extension which allows you to run
javascript code after some pages are loaded. Typically, you would want
to iterate over the set of links, use a RegExp to see if you want to
modify that link (in you case, if it is a http:// link) and set the
href of the link to the https:// version.

it moves on....

Hi friends

We are a Chennai based start-up - an ISV building innovative software
products in the HR domain. We are part of a 6.5 Billion Euro MNC with
operations in 44 countries. With a current order book of 2 million dollars
and our customer base, we believe that we will be the next big product
story from India.

We are a very progressive organization: we allocate 10% of our profits for
training and share 20% of our profits amongst employees. Diversity and
flexibility are important to us. For example, we provide laptops and
broadband connexions (at home) to all our developers.

MinVesta is also building open source based products for some of our
clients. We are growing our FOSS team. This team will work 70% of the time
in customising identified FOSS products for our clients or porting our
products to FOSS platforms. 20% of their time will be spent in
contributing to the FOSS community by working on those FOSS products. For
the remaining 10% you can work on FOSS projects of your choice.

We are open to discussing flexible modes of working, for those who do not
want to move to Chennai.

By way of skills we are looking for PHP/Python/Perl expertise and
experience in developing database driven web-based applications.

Please contact me off-list.

Dear List,

I guess there will be quite a few persons who are using some broadband
service where they are metered by the byte. What I would like to know
is their view on which interface they would recommend for checking
mail, fetchmail/getmail/Evolution/Thunderbird, where one downloads all
mail using POP/IMAP or a GMail like interface; when it comes to number
of bytes used.

Assuming that you read all of the useful mail you get, which may
include many mailing list messages, won't the online interface add
more overhead? Of course, we all get some spam message or the other
which we might delete without even opening it. Same holds for some
mail with attachments. So, I'd like to know your experience and
recommendation on this issue, even though this may vary from
individual to individual.

Thank you.

Kumar

Hi,
I have been thinking about the same whenever I open the Thunderbird at 
home. In office, I don't have any upload/download restrictions as we 
have an unlimited connection here. But at home, with ! GB limit for a 
month, half of it is taken for all my mail, 4 mailing lists, other group 
mails, forwards and more. Due to this, at home I have set the settings 
such that I download all my mails only from LUG and my personal ID. I 
have disabled all other mails, especially from the linux-kenrel mailing 
list as I get a minimum of 200 mails per day. I also tried making the 
settings such that only headers are obtained, but I dint find comfy with 
it as some times I wished to see the mail directly and seeking the mail 
content was an additional over head. Think if a mail client can provide 
an email like interface, then it would be much better :)

Subject: [Ilugc] Doubt Regarding Squid Proxy
Message-ID: <BAY111-F25B496AEC4A2BC9A99622FDF990@phx.gbl>



Hi friends,

I've one query regarding Squid Proxy.

What I want to do is that the requests from the user desktop first go thru 
Squid Proxy (Port 800) which does URL Filtering and then the filtered 
traffic from Squid will be forwarded to Symantec Web Security which is 
another Proxy which has the Virus Scanning ability (Here we don&#8217;t do 
any URL filtering only Virus Filtering) . But we are not able to forward the 
Filtered traffic from Squid to Symantec Web Security which works on Port 
8002. Please advise how this can be done.


          The traffic flow should be like this,


              User Request --->  Squid Proxy ---> Symantec Web Security

With Regards,

Krishna

I'd arrange them in increasing order of bytes transferred as:

Gmail - IMAP - Other web based mail - POP

(there might be a few special cases in Other web based mail that could
rank on the left of IMAP - Softhome.net, for example).

Just curious... how do you say Gmail performs better than a network
protocol... AFAIK, IMAP has very little overhead... not that informed
about POP though...

it moves on...

All web-based email systems have the potential to be on the left of
IMAP. This is because of the way email treats attachments. Any
non-text/* attachment (or rather, anything that doesn't fit into 7-bit
ASCII) is encoded in some way - usually MIME. MIME increases the size
of the attachment by about 33%, which is what you save with a decent
web-based mailing system.

In case of Yahoo/Hotmail etc., the junk they have on their web UI more
than offsets this saving, in my opinion :)

Is the junk on these sites much more that the "user interface" in
GMail? Like chat etc. From what you say, I guess it is, but still...

Well, I thought this discussion was solely about email data volumes.
If you also want the various instant messaging systems compared, that
is yet another discussion...

Not really a direct answer to your question, but today it's easy to
upgrade to an unlimited traffic account.  Touchtel for instance
sells 128kbps connections for ~ Rs 600 per month.

An unlimited traffic account has several advantages:
1.  You never have to worry about internet traffic, and can download
    ISOs, Bittorrent, etc. at will.
2.  Did you read 1?
3.  All ISP traffic monitoring systems are faulty, and you'll eventually
    end up fighting with them at some point for incorrect billing.
    Touchtel once billed me Rs 70,000.  Tataindicom regularly
    billed me Rs 4000 per month while the same 256kbps unlimited
    connection would have cost me only Rs 900.

Metered traffic is practical only when your connection is *very* slow.
My Reliance R-Connect wireless has a 1GB cap, but my typical
usage would never exceed ~200MB.

IMAP may not be as efficient as it seems...

IMAP is bandwidth efficient only if you don't sync mail and load it
in parts (headers, body, attachments, etc).  I find this impractical
because by not syncing you never have a full copy of your email
locally and must connect to the IMAP server fetch message
bodies, attachments etc.

If I don't use the "Sync on Arrival" mail extension, Thunderbird does
not cache the mail body and re-fetches every time you click on an
email.  Waste of bandwidth.  It also has the annoying side effect
that your email does not load immediately, but instead takes a few
seconds to load from server.

There are occasions when IMAP sync goes beserk and chews
traffic.  This happens with Thunderbird, imapsync, and worst of
all on Outlook which becomes totally unresponsive during sync.

Moving emails is expensive (esp. to Trash).  It involves moving
the email on the server and a download/sync to the corresponding
local folder.

Sending email on IMAP is expensive -- once for SMTP to server,
and again to store it in the "Sent Items" IMAP folder on the server.
And if you are really unlucky, once more to download/sync it to
save it in your local Sent Items folder.

Most of these quirks can probably be ironed out by carefully
setting your mail client's options, but the fixes are often obscure.

IMO, POP is much nicer on bandwidth, but offers a reduced
feature set.

This is the advantage of IMAP, and why it was at the second spot in my
list. Only those email mime parts are downloaded. Some people like it,
some don't. Personally, I prefer it that way - my mail server's spool
is on a RAID5 array with a well defined backup policy implemented
strictly. My laptop has a IDE disk which can crash anytime :)

Client-side problem. Protocol not to be blamed.

Client-side problem. Protocol not to be blamed. Though my Outlook 2003
doesn't show this behaviour.

No. Only the headers are sync'ed. Your client should allow you to
specify which folders to sync (Outlook calls it "subscribe").

See above. Courier IMAP has the concept of an Outbox folder. You just
store emails you want to send in the Outbox folder, and the server
injects the email into the queue.

The thread was about which is the most bandwidth-efficient. POP3
doesn't come anywhere close to IMAP. Every MIME part of every email is
downloaded in POP3.

I also think that the bandwidth is in abundance and one need not worry much.

Last week a marketing executive visited our office with a proposal for  -
some 56 mbps ( not kbps) 24/7and unlimited download wi max internet
connection for some attractive price. ( not  remembering the exact cost )

amazing jump from kbps to  mbps .  that too unlimited download . that too
wireless .
it is really unbelievable
dishnet dsl in Chennai is offering this.

Careful - 54 Mbps (not 56) is the maximum data rate of 802.11g
wireless networks. This will not be the speed of your Internet
connection - that would still be some sort of ADSL and not more than
2Mbps certainly.

Greg Kroah-Hartman has decided that it's time to put an end to people
sneering that Linux lacks a proper device driver development kit. So, he
has created the first Linux DDK. It includes a fresh 2.6.16.18 kernel, a
full copy of LDD3, and copies of all the in-tree kernel documentation. A

Hi,

Yes we did try cache peer option after going thru Squid manual but without 
success. As I don't have much idea about Linux I'm really struggling with 
this, please provide me with the detailed solution like where to add the 
cache peer line in Squid configuration and what will be the exact command 
for that, if you want further information from my end for doing this please 
mail me I'll provide you with all the necessary information.

I guess cache)peer will not work as it uses icp_port for communication
between the peers to know about the objects in that peer cache. May be
u can try but what port you will specify for the icp_port... if the
symantec virus filter has the option of handling the icp queries you
can use thi... otherwise you cannot... the only way i found is using
the port forwarding

The label there needs some clarification.  Even longer messages are 
*downloaded* upto the limit set but bytes exceeding it are truncated 
with a link to download the remainder, if you want to read the remaining 
lines.  This feature is a real time saver more than anything else, and 
has worked better for me than the other options like fetchmail or the

To the original poster:

Apache will typically not follow sym links outside your DocumentRoot.
The reason is obvious, a symlink inside the DocumentRoot pointing to
the root dir "/" will totally expose your entire file system to the web.

To redirect http://foo.com/yum to /repository/Fedora add the following
line to the appropriate section of your apache config file:
    Alias /yum /repository/Fedora

Note: the lack of trainling slashes on the path names are significant.

As Binand suggests, please do some homework before posting
questions.  Reading through comments in your apache config files
should be a good start.  Verbatim copying + pasting your error
messages on google produces surprisingly good results.

But doesnt sound like a residential broadband connection, if at all remotely
residential dont think it would be in affordable range.

I use Fastmail.FM, an IMAP based domain. Allows you to filter emails capped
by some maximum attachment size (that should save some BW). But donno if it
allows that filtering for Guest type accounts (IMAP is free though). I've
been using for almost 3 yrs now and found it pretty good. The webmail is
pretty lightweight too.

I guess they even have the instructions to configure in pine. Without all
those HTML, think that should be a BW efficient alternative.

I second this. Also, I feel always on connectivity can be taken for granted
one year from now (unless there is an outbreak of some carcinoma or melanoma
of the brain or heart or prostate etc attributable to the mobile phone :-) )

 When connectivity becomes ubiquitous and continuous, all one will need is a
browser device for most computing purposes.

Greets!

I'm fairly good at C.. but not that good... I want to start looking at
the kernel code and try and understand things.

So, what do I do to upgrade my skills? Any specific book I can follow?

my suggestion
download kernel source from kernel.org and hack around and thats way
to learn stuff
also there are some sites
http://kernelnewbies.org/  which will explain basic things

to know more,

but no new features.  This release is available from the FTP servers
listed here: http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html

As usual, a vast number of people contributed to this release -- far

i was a fan of OpenOffice, but after using KOffice 1.5 version...its like ,
if you want M$ doc support, Oo helps-but it doesnt rock !, if not, use
KOffice, it rocks!..

with the new release, they have added many features.....

i would recommend to try KOffice 1.5...we Yoper have shifted our docs and
presentations to KOffice 1.5 than using Oo and he memory is also used more
by Oo when compared to KOffice 1.5...Even the slides i presented in the LUG
was from KPresenter...guys, you have to try KPresenter, it rocks!...

just have a try..... :)

Don't know about kernel code. But THE book you MUST have for C is "The
C Programming Language", by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan. Costs
Rs.95 (MRP), andwill teach you not just C, but some style and
paradigms of programming.

HTH.

My sister (who was at BITS Pilani till a couple of years back) asked her 
prof just that question

His answer was "Any book, as long as Vijay Mukhi didnt write it"

Pretty good advice, that.

Haven't heard about him, but some googling revealed that he is the
author of many "popular cs books"... Is he *that* bad? ;)

Yes. He starts with void main (void) { ... }, tells the readers that
conio.h is someone one should expect on all platforms, and that NEAR
and FAR pointers are part of standard C. And that is just the
beginning.

Unfortunately, several people have already been taken in because his
books are cheap and NIIT-type places recommend his books.

Wow! Great! Reminds me of one fat yellow demi-sized indian-authored
book on C (don't remember author/title, but I guess it is still
popular), which used to be "recommended" by many schools. (Was
fortunate enought not to be one of those schools, but had heard many
of my friends at schools referring me to it)... Had a hearty laugh
when I chanced across that book sometime back, what with huge detailed
sections on "screen programming", "dos interrupts" etc. Was a
revelation to me that this was a part of a C primer book :p

Well, too much of a digression, but on a related note... Just happened
to visit Anna University sometime back for a competition, and was
taken aback to find the old DOS based Borland C still being used.
Well, atleast VC is a bit tolerable, but having had the misfortune of
using it in my school days, that thing is a menace!

it moves on...

I think I have told the list already, but anyway. You don't need to
use Oo just because you need to view Word docs. I have only had one or
two instances where wv or antiword had not done a good job... (You may
not get "smart" quotes tho ;) ).. Of course, YMMV :)

And heard from a friend, even for Oo, you don't need to open up the
full gui for conversions. Guess there is a command line / smaller gui
kind of way to do that. Not too sure though... Anyone has done this
before?

it moves on...

The latest edition of K&R was written in 1988 - that's nearly two
decades ago.  C has changed quite a bit since that time.  The biggest
change has been the adoption of C99 as the latest standard[0].
Kernighan and Ritchie have denied any plans of upgrading their book
for c99.  The classic is great, but there are better and more modern
resources for the advanced/advancing C programmer these days.

There are three specific publications that I would highly recommend
for a reasonably experienced C programmer who wants to take his/her
understanding of the language to the next level:

1. C: A Reference Manual, by Samuel P. Harbison, and Guy L. Steele Jr.
 This book is hugely underrated in 'popular' circles - it hardly gets
any mentioned in responses to 'What book for C' type queries.  The
book is of the highest quality, in terms of comprehensiveness, clarity
of expression, and utility as a user-friendly reference book.  It is
also far more frequently updated, and is currently in its fifth
edition.

2. "Expert C Programming: Deep Sea Secrets", by Peter Van der Linden.
A brilliantly written book.  Technical books would be so much more
popular if written like this one.  This touches on advanced topics
only, and you cannot call yourself an expert in C if you are not fully
comfortable with the entire contents of this book.  To be read from
cover to cover.

3. Lastly, once you have seen it all, there is The Real Thing - the
ISO Standard itself.  This is the ultimate reference, as this is what
compiler writers and language lawyers on comp.std.c etc. refer to.
The print version is outrageously expensive, but a PDF is available
for approx $30 (was $18 when I bought my copy ... ) - for a serious
professional C programmer it's worth every paisa of that.  You can buy
your copy here:

Well, IIRC C99 became an ISO standard only in 2004 or so. I don't
think any of the mainstream compilers fully support C99 - what is the
status of GCC? Are there any applications that use the features of C99
yet?

On the other hand, the fact that a book written in 1988 is relevant
and authoritative in its topic in 2006 - 18 years later - proves the
advantages of open standards, IMO.

E17 (Enlightenment DR17) does use the features of C99.

And since the printf family of functions in FreeBSD doesn't support the 
"%a" format specifier, I had to use the free ctrio library for compiling 
E17 on FreeBSD 4.x.

The Balaguruswamy book (he was a PSG Coimbatore prof and I think he's the

the stuff that's in it, content wise.  Been years since I saw a copy of

There's another "interesting" C book by an indian author - reasonably
popular. Yashwant Kanitkar's "Spirit of C", "Let us C" etc books.

I remember a rather packed lecture he gave 7 or 8 years back in Hyderabad -
and he started it off with "shouldnt we hang Charles Simonyi" :)

OTOH, this is the book that I have found to be recommended by most
sites (along with K&R). Have never seen anywhere though. Did you buy
this in India, or online from abroad?

Not really.  From what I recall it was called C9X when it was being
developed, and after ratification by ISO, has come to be known as C99.
 Maybe not 1999, but pretty close to that frame.

> I don't think any of the mainstream compilers fully support C99

That was the case a year or two back.  I am not aware of the current scenairo.

http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html

Plenty.  Any C program that uses // comments is using a c99 feature
:-)  A lot of the GCC extensions are now official C features (with
minor tweaks to syntax/semantics).  Like for example zero length
arrays.

Me too :)  The book is published by Prentice Hall, which ofcourse has
a huge presence in India, and also publishes K&R.  I found it strange
that they did not get Harbison&Steele here.  But I would not be
surprised if the situation is different now.  I guess someone will
find out and let us know.

Years back I bought Kanetkar's 'Let us C++ ' book. When I began reading it
there was a sense of deja vu...... I knew I had read it before!!! The only
other C++ book I had read was Robert Lafore. So I got hold of a copy of
Lafore and did a random check. I was amazed to see entire paragraphs lifted
word for word. After this I lost respect for this guy.

Its picasa which runs using wine. i dont think so that google
developed fully for linux using open source. for me already it worked
in my fedora system using wine. so its not a wonder

should be faster though. it has been developed using winelib, and does
not use wine, the emulator.

Yes it is not wonder. What I want to convey is: after a lot of request
from Linux world, Google has come down to this extent atleast to
release a reliable picase installtion with no need to having knowledge
about wine pre-requisites. I too have tested picase using wine, But
this has come up more stable and well integrated with desktop.

Yes, it is faster compared to wine based user installation.

Hi LUGies,

I have bought a Lenovo N100 which has come with a preinstalled version 
of Windows XP.

1. I either want to partition the 80GB HDD, which is now existing as a 
single partition under windows, so that I can install Linux. Which is 
the best way to do this. Partition Magic is proprietary. Will fdisk be a 
good option?

2. I tried running Ubuntu 5.10 Live CD, where the X couldn't start , 
reason: no display devices found. Which distro will be able to run X 
with this display chip set satisfactorily ?

chance though).

   Hi all,

   Sorry, in my last post think I forgot to mention my Chipset ( thanks to
   aanjhan for pointing it).. it is Mobile Intel(R) 945GM Express Chipset
   Family.

   Second, I just now tried running Knoppix Live CD (not the new version, but
   some 1 year old one) in my Laptop and it ran without any problems, that
   too in 1280X800 mode. So, feel a bit confidant that Debian and other
   favoured distros may be able to run. Yet to try them, as I have to first
   partition my hard disk.

   Third, has any one had problem running BSNL broadband in their laptops,
   especially lenovo or IBMs ?

Sorry to hijack this post, but is it possible to purchase a laptop
without windows even though they package it along with the laptop.

I think I remember something like Return windows day or something when
people got money back for returning OEM installed windows.

I believe the low-end Lenovo's give you a choice of either Windows 
pre-loaded or without an OS.

Hello all,

I recently salvaged an old P3 500Mhz System with 64 MB of Ram & 8Gb HDD
(IDE).

Initially I Wanted to use this system as a Router & Server so i installed
two network adapters. But Recently i have thought of using this as a comp
that does both server and desktop.

My Server is basically a Mail/web server with virtual hosting and Ftp
Access.
The Desktop is mainly to run a Web Browser, Mail Client, Text Editor.

Does Anyone Know a Way to implement this

Debian should be fair enough. after installing the base system, better
install a lightweight envt like Xfce, fluxbox or enlightenment. I
would suggest fluxbox for ur system configuration. Regarding browser,
firefox will blow your system(just 64mb ram). So better use opera. If
you dont want X atall, fine.. use lynx or elinks2

If you are looking for a lean distribution that would run peacefully out of 
the box on an old machine (such as the one you mentioned), try 
Vector Linux 5.1 (http://www.vectorlinux.com). I've been using the 
same on a couple of old Compaq Deskpro machines (PII 233 MHz with 
64 MB RAM) for a long time now. 

Once you install Vector Linux, select your default desktop (by running 
the command 'xwmconfig') to 'icewm-desk' - might give you a familiar
Windows XP look, (icewm window manager + ROX-Filer) but its fast 
and highly usable on old machines. All desktop relevant software that 
you need exist on this distro (including OpenOffice), along with XAMPP 
(http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html) if you need 
Apache+MySQL+PHP+ProFTPd

Vector Linux is based on Slackware, thus all packages (mail servers, 
blah-blah) meant for Slackware linux could be installed as-is on this distro.

If you prefer to self-tweaking/self-customized distro for your old machine,
Slackware should be good to start with.

Cheers,
CSB

I would recommend you to get the Gentoo base installed, and bootstrap 
GCC and optimally compile the necessary things needed for your system. 
Nothing can challenge this ;)

Regarding the web browser for your 64 Meg system, forget any Mozilla 
based browser, you could try Dillo if you would run X, otherwise links 
is your friend.

As for mail client, you can choose either Mutt/Elm/Pine.

Why should I say no to GUI?

Windows 2003 Server comes with optional component of Certificate Authority
(CA) software. You can find this in your WK3 CD. Install it. Navigate from
your client (Linux)to http://localhost/certsrv . You will find a link to
download and install certificates. Follow the instructions there.

Steele is quite an impressive chap. He has written one of the most
cited books on C (this one). He was the chap to give TeX it's first
boost when he ported Knuth's system to the MIT systems. Along with
Sussman, he created the language Scheme. He wrote what was the
standard definition of Common Lisp. Bill Joy hired him to write the
definition of the Java language. He was the person to start collecting
a 'standard' set of TECO macros, which Stallman then went on to turn
into Emacs. He wrote the original "Hacker's Dictionary", which Eric
Raymond made into the Jargon File. And God only know what else ...

He pretty much had a finger in everything going on in this time ... :)

Please let me know what is your client application? When you navigate to CA
of W2K3 from your browser, you are downloading the certificate. When you
install it from Mozilla browser, it is actually installed for a client
called Mozilla. This certificate will be combined in a file called
cert8.dbfile in your mozilla profile.

So if you want your custom client application to use this certificate, you
need a binary version of this certificate to be downloaded at your path.
This is usually done using GetCertificate API call in Windows based clients.
You can use HTTP query also to get the certificate independent of OS. One
workaround is simply saving the issued certificate in CA as binary file and
copy this to your linux client. If anyone has some other way to do it, i am
also interested.

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041215
Firefox/1.0 Red Hat/1.0-12.EL4 .
 i am trying to make a single signon using the windows AD.
 now i am able to authenticate.but the session is closed immeditely
giving the error message

 i was not able to do the steps in the documentation where they are

Message-ID: <edd8ce540605282204r41042efdg46f744541caeee3e@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

we have a postfix mailserver in one of our subnet which dont have
direct connection to the outside world. Mails are send (relayed to )
through other postfix mailserver at another location in our
network(different subnet).

And my problem is when i am trying to send mails to outside domains
from mail clients(outlook)
i am getting the error relay denied.(but works when i am sending it
from the same machine CLI).
I think its the default behaviour of postfix.(?).can i solve this problem?

can anybody suggest a solution?
thanks & regards

You have to allow your LAN IPs to send email through your postfix mailserver

For that kind of thing - and other basic questions about postfix, please 
do yourself a favor and read this thoroughly before you setup postfix or 
any other mailservers ..

how to specify it is it with
smtpd_client_restrictions
smtpd_recipient_restrictions
will it not work with default entries. I am geting the error relay
denied when trying to send mailout side domain(after RCPT TO ) but
works fine for local domain.

authentication for local users (create unix logins with /bin/false shell 
for them all and do this -)

I'm seeing questions on which C book to follow and which distro to
use. Man this is classic material that start flame wars. I smell
something burning already!

disucssions regarding "C" books,distros all depends on each individual's
interest. I may like one book/one distro and you cannot expect the same from
others....i think thats the reason there are several distros out there.....

instead of discussing on these , by now if the person who asked had visited
some good buk shop/distrowatch, and read a jist of the book/review, he could
arrived with a book/distro.

Thanks everyone for suggesting various solutions for my problem.

Today I got 128 Megs of Ram and 40 GB of disk space in return for my 64 &
8gb equivalents from my dad..... So at the moment i don't think it Will be
Much of a problem to get RH9 on my system... But After looking at all the
suggestions I am Really Inclined to Use XFCE with Opera...

Today I tried rolling my own distro...based on uClibC & busy box...But my
plan failed and my comp was nowhere close to Usability (i Used a LFS6 live
CD as my development Environment). The buildroot Package seems to be an
Ideal Solution to my Idea but since i did not have enough time today I
simply downloaded the Root_fs file from the ftp.iitm.ac.in mirror of uclibc
(ftp://ftp.iitm.ac.in/pub/linux/libs/uclibc) after that mounted the
extracted file via a loop device and copied all the files over to my hdd
(the old 8gb one) after adding a kernel image and boot loader (GRUB) the
system was highly to my taste it takes only 8 seconds to boot in single user
mode with init directly launching /bin/sh and has the basic tool chain
etc... But still this has few packages like Dropbear Which Made my Second
bootup in the normal mode halt midway... I was thinking wether it woud be
possible to have a PC using a root filesystem constructed Using Buildroot
with options of i686 also the package selection screen of Buildroot Mentions
a Tiny X server in lieu of xorg this could also be tried out this method
does not allow me to use Opera which does not give Sources

I would also like to try debian but i only have the NetInstall CD and I dont
think I can Download A lot on My 64kbps Connection

Certainly there are some really good Free (as in Freedom) Web
browsers.Why not use them? Opera is a Non-Free Software.

 Matt Oquist to team-contacts
 More options  May 29 (17 hours ago) Hi everyone,

It's time to get started on team plans for celebrating Software
Freedom Day 2006, and this mailing list will be the primary means by
which the SFD organizers make announcements to you, the SFD team
leaders.

DATE: SFD '06 will officially be held on Saturday, September 16th.

WEB: The SFD website is still at http://softwarefreedomday.org, even
though this mailing list is at sf-day.org. (sf-day.org will soon be
updated to point to the website.)

In 2006 we can once again offer a limited amount of sponsored
materials to prepared teams who apply for it; these sponsored
materials will be SFD CDs (TheOpenCD + Ubuntu Live) for distribution
to the public and a more limited number of t-shirts for SFD team
members.

We are not yet taking applications for sponsored materials, but we
will post an announcement on softwarefreedomday.org and to this list
when the sponsorship application period begins. Note: We will say more
about this later, but the best way to obtain these sponsored materials
for your team's celebration is by carefully planning an effective
event. Get started now by finding a location and planning the nature
of your event -- check out the StartGuide for more help:
http://www.softwarefreedomday.org/StartGuide

Welcome to SFD 2006, and we hope you all have a great time and
effectively educate the public about Software Freedom!

As always, please email info -at- softwarefreedomday.org with any
questions or comments.

Regards,
The Board of Software Freedom International

It was just a suggestion.Nothing more than that.Certainly there are
many for whom Freedom comes first.

In what way is Opera more usable than other browsers (free/non-free)?

   You can use Routerlinux (uclibc + busybox) as a starting point:

http://www.gctglobal.com/Products/Set_Top_Box/STB1030_3036/RouterLinux/routerlinux.html

 There's a uclibc buildroot environment for routerlinux that uses a
(modified)
Slackware-like build/packaging script, and Slackware's package format. Using
that, you can build packages on a regular GNU/Linux host (say RH7->FC1),
and transfer and install it on a routerlinux target, which can have as
little as
4 MB of RAM and 12 MB of storage. My routerlinux boxes are all
router/firewall
boxes running P1-class CPUs, 16 MB of RAM and small (~100 MB) IDE hard
disks or Solid-State DiskOnChip Flash ROMs.

A lot more intutive and smooth UI than (say) firefox or konqueror

Very smooth integration with memo entries, mail and other parts of the opera
suite.

Call it a personal preference.

When there are lot of options available,  we cannot expect everybody like
the same. So, starting a debate/argument does not seem good here and it can
be handled in private rather than in mailing lists.....

Hi,

I am trying to use wget along with "--load-cookies" switch. 

I need to mention the name of the cookie along with its value in a txt file and am sending the same as a parameter. W.r.t this, can you kindly let me know what should be the format of the cookie file?

I am using the following format in the cookie file (that is being passed as a param):
<cookie_name> = <cookie_value>

Is this right?  ;as, this doesnt seem to work.

If i hit the mid-tier url rather than hitting the big-ip, then this seems to work. But I am not sure whether this will dis-regard the cookie file in this case.Do i have configure big-ip to work for wget along with the cookie-option?

Kindly correct me if I am wrong and do lemme know of ur comments/feedbacks.

I could run Opera 8.5 (on Slackware 10.2) on my old IBM laptop
(IBM 380ED - Pentium 133MMX with 32 MB RAM) and its pretty
much usable for most websites (other than those that throw-up
java applets or those that are heavily AJAX oriented).

Opera isn't just usable, the UI is extremely intuitive and well thought.
And yes, at the size of Mozilla Firefox, you get a web browser+email
client+many other features, and still feel light and fast - it doesn't
clutter your desktop with too many widgets/icons. It loads faster,
renders pages better. Try Ctrl++/Ctrl+- while viewing a page with
graphical images on Mozilla Firefox or any of your favourite web
browser, try the same on Opera to notice the difference.

Mozilla Firefox, though an excellent attempt at creating a web browser
isn't all that light IMO. I've never had success running firefox peacefully
on machines with 64 MB RAM, and its performance is crippled even at
128 MB RAM (on a Pentium II that I tested).

Opera isn't Free Software - yet, its one of the best modern web
browser that I've ever used.

Cheers!

If you did man wget, it tells you that the cookie file has to be in
the same format as Netscape's cookie file format:

"""
           Load cookies from file before the first HTTP retrieval.
file is a textual file in the format originally used by
           Netscape's cookies.txt file.

           You will typically use this option when mirroring sites
that require that you be logged in to access some or all
           of their content.  The login process typically works by the
web server issuing an HTTP cookie upon receiving and
           verifying your credentials.  The cookie is then resent by
the browser when accessing that part of the site, and
           so proves your identity.

           Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same
cookies your browser sends when communicating with the
           site.  This is achieved by --load-cookies---simply point
Wget to the location of the cookies.txt file, and it
           will send the same cookies your browser would send in the
same situation.  Different browsers keep textual
           cookie files in different locations:

           Netscape 4.x.
               The cookies are in ~/.netscape/cookies.txt.

           Mozilla and Netscape 6.x.
               Mozilla's cookie file is also named cookies.txt,
located somewhere under ~/.mozilla, in the directory of
               your profile.  The full path usually ends up looking
somewhat like ~/.mozilla/default/some-weird-
               string/cookies.txt.

           Internet Explorer.
               You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the
File menu, Import and Export, Export Cookies.  This
               has been tested with Internet Explorer 5; it is not
guaranteed to work with earlier versions.

           Other browsers.
               If you are using a different browser to create your
cookies, --load-cookies will only work if you can locate
               or produce a cookie file in the Netscape format that
Wget expects.

I have a digi cam, from which I upload photos quite routinely into my 
desktop which has *only*  Linux. But its not a Canon Digi cam but a 
Fujifilm. I haven't checked it out in Ubuntu but when I plug my digi cam 
into the USB port, FC4 opens up a window showing my pics in the digi cam 
and gives me an option to move my picture to a location in my PC. I 
don't use any other app. to transfer pics from my digi cam to my 
FC4.Think if it can work with Fujifilm cam, it should also work without 
any hitch with a canon digicam.

openssh is an opensource implementation of SSH protocol 1 and 2. It is being 
developed for openbsd and a separate portable version for other platforms

The product name is : openssh
Its version is: 3.5p1  (p1 stands for portable version 1)

This supports both SSH protocol 1 and 2  ( The protocol versions 1.5 and 
below are considered SSH protocol 1)

Openssh uses libcrypto from openssl and hence its version is also given.

Yes, I totally agree to it.  Its not fast, but the computers have become 
  faster. ;-)

But still I prefer to use Firefox rather than IE or Opera or Safari not 
only because its free software, but also fits perfect as a developer 
friendly browser with its support to the latest technologies right from 
E4X to CSS3 to a built-in XSLT processor, and SVG, and XForms and so on.

I haven't mentioned about any new feature that is bundled with it.

If you strip all of this, yes Mozilla will be lean and mean, well you 
can build a lean and mean browser for yourself ;-)

Canon's digicams are PTP devices, not USB mass storage ones. You need a PTP 
app like GPhoto2 or Kamera (which is a KIO::slave) to use them. My Powershot 
A400 works quite well with Kamera and gphoto2.

I installed InstantRails. I guess this installs mySql db along with it. I am using SQL navigator as the IDE to connect to DB.

Now, how do i find the name of the mySQL DB installed in my machine? and how do i connect to the same?

Early response would be highly appreciate as i am stuck at a stage wherein i want to connect to the DB and am unable to proceed with My First R0R Application . :D

I think you need to do some reading up on mysql basics first. You need to
create your rails application and then create your database instance. Before
that, you need to create a user acccount with mysql server. Never used
Instant Rails, so can't help you with the details.

HTH.

I am pretty much comfortable with databases :D ...my question was very much specific to configuring mySQL DB along with InstantRails.

I have a Canon IXUS2 and 350D and have no problems with gphoto2.
Both of them use USB and I run an ancient Debian stable without
any problems at all.

Check the gphopto2 camera compatibility list and google for the
camera settings (you may need to fiddle with "normal" and "ptp"
modes before your camera is detected).

The last time I checked, Gimp  could not handle "raw" format
images and Canon's Windows utilities were required for
processing the images.  You may want to check that again.
