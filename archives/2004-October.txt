Boot with your orinal kernel and find out / partition

$ df -H
Filesystem             Size   Used  Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda1             510MB  362MB  122MB  75% /

And replace root=/dev/hda1 and reboot with new kernel

LABLE is a typo??. In conf file, it seems to be correct.

hello,
thank you for informing&( flaming me )
sorry i could not reply sooner because my exams are going on.
  i started this thread because i thought that i was contributing to a
common goal!
any ways i am a big astronomy buff so the idea of seti project was
know to me (frankly even i agree with most of the people here because
i am not into aliens and stuff like that my self)
it was only after i posted here and at other lists that i came to know
that there are better ways to contribute to the world.

In the global section check if you have given proper values for mask. My 
values are shown below.

create mask = 0770
directory mask = 0750

Hi
        The same thing happened to me three months back. I really dont 
remember what changes i made to the configuration so that it worked fine. 
I think I copied the default configuration settings that comes with wvdial 
and made the changes to the numbers, userid and password. It worked. 

Cheers

You can use a software sound mixer to do this job. Which mixer u use
depends on whether you are using Gnome or KDE.

The mixer program for Gnome is called esound daemon while the one for
KDE is called arts. On of these should be running by default.

so if it's arts (u r running KDE) then u could you something like 
$ mplayer -ao arts myfile.avi 

while in XMMS, from preferences, you can choose output plugin to be arts.

Similar procedure if u r on esd (gnome) 

$mplayer -ao esd myfile.avi

and output plugin esd in xmms

Check if you have your username and password entry correctly in
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets file in the format below as show below:

/etc/ppp/pap-secrets
--------------------
"foobar"  *  "foopassword"

Did you use the command 'pon new_conn' to connect ?

Strange thing, but I did face issues while connecting to internet
using Sancharnet earlier. The first time I tried to connect, it failed
(with Authentication Failure message in the logs), though it connected
the second time - and this problem was somewhat consistent (and I have
no idea as to why!).

Cheers,

Since you are running FC2, I assume that you GRUB and not LILO. I wonder 
  why you are bothere about LILO configuration file.

Anyway, if you install SuSE, tell the installer not to install the boot 
loader in MBR. Instead, write the boot loader in the BR of the partition 
you install. Assuming you install SuSE in /dev/hda2, your entry in GRUB 
configuration file (/boot/grub/menu.lst of FC2) will be

title SuSE Linux
rootnoverify (hd0,1)
chainloader +1

Subject: [Ilugc] Upgrading PHP on RedHat9
Message-ID: <5800e99804100123121923ce21@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Here is a snip of what happens when i try to install php-4.3.7 from
source on my RedHat9 box which already has Apache2 and ph-4.2.2
installed with MySQL.
I first checked for DSO support and found that mod_so is built in as
was told it should be in the INSTALL file.

[root@localhost php-4.3.7]# httpd -l
Compiled in modules:
  core.c
  prefork.c
  http_core.c
  mod_so.c

I then gave the configure command with the configure options that i
obtained as output in phpinfo();. I have removed the options except
for apxs which is giving the prob.

[root@localhost php-4.3.7]# './configure' '--with-apxs2=/usr/sbin/apxs'

Sorry, I cannot run apxs.  Possible reasons follow:

1. Perl is not installed
2. apxs was not found. Try to pass the path using --with-apxs2=/path/to/apxs
3. Apache was not built using --enable-so (the apxs usage page is displayed)

The output of /usr/sbin/apxs follows:
./configure: line 5080: /usr/sbin/apxs: No such file or directory
configure: error: Aborting

I even installed mod_perl on this warning though i do not need it and
rebooted the system. Trying to locate apxs here is what i got.

[root@localhost php-4.3.7]# locate apxs
/var/www/manual/programs/apxs.html

:-) The help file which was of no help.I tried being a bit more
verbose with the configuration options and:
 
[root@localhost php-4.3.7]# locate apxs2
[root@localhost php-4.3.7]# 


My question is how did php get installed in the first go when i
installed my system with these options.

What should i do now to upgrade php. Where is apxs. As mod_so is
getting listed in httpd -l that means it should be there on my system.
Shouldnt it.

Hi All,

I would like to know if i can use MySQL MaxDB instead of using the
normal MySQL server in LAMP based applications.

Are there any licensing issues involved with MaxDB. From MySQL.com all
i could figure was bth the products are available under dual licensing
which mans i can use either of them non commercially.

I would like to use Max DB bcos of the support of triggers and stored
procedures. Also will there be any performance difference between the
2 (standard MySQL and MaxDB). Is the procedure to connect to MaxDB
same i.e mysql_*(). or Are these functions of no use with MaxDB.

Message-ID: <8816fcf80410020917534dc32b@mail.gmail.com>

Just got 128 kbps, with 500 mb limit from touchtel.  They rejected my
opt for the free night browsing (unlimited with extra Rs. 100 payable
per month), as I am using router rather than usb modem.

Anybody provided with free night browsing along with router?

In fact, they said router is not available with unlimited plans.  So I
can't get that 128kbps unlimited plan.

Now I feel the pain of living with 500 MB limit.  Mere browsing will
eat up that!  Nothing will happen if I did "apt-get remove apt"

  Is there anything that prevents the use of a dedicated Linux router
instead of the router provided by Touchtel? That way, you could opt for
the unlimited plan, but use a Linux router (basically, an old PC running
an LRP or similar minimal distro).

The interfaces are RJ-45 Ethernet cable (connecting to PC ethernet)
and RJ-11 standard phone/DSL line cable (incoming touchtel line).

What do you think is the cost effective way of getting a router
(device or dedicated box) that supports these interfaces?

  Does the USB DSL modem (supplied with the unlimited plan) have a 
Linux driver? If so, all you need is a Pentium/133 with a USB interface,
16 MB RAM, a small hard drive (say 500 MB) or CDROM, and an Ethernet card
to set up a dedicated Linux router - it can be done for Rs.2500 or less,
depending on what pieces you can find for free.

  Almost all the difficulty lies in the USB modem - try to find its
model number and ask about Linux drivers from Touchtel. If the drivers
are binary-only, it's a bit of a pain, but still manageable.

Use curses or ncurses. It's a different API, but has similar functionality.

  It depends on the API - you can't actually create an executable that
links to MFC or similar Windows crap because that's closed. However,
if you use a closs-platform API like Mono, or Microsoft's Unix services
for Windows, you can write apps that can be compiled for either
Linux or Windows targets - but you'll have to build it on the appropriate
build host.

  You can also use Wine, VMs or emulation to run VC++ in a Windows session
under Linux.

  You can't buy anything other than P4s and Athlons new, but you can always
find scrap 486s and above easily - there were a lot of them made. Intel
sold ~100M classic Pentium CPUs, and most of them are still in the field,
being discarded or phased out slowly. Probably about 30-40% of them have
the buggy FPU, and Intel has agreed to honour the lifetime warranty by
replacing those CPUs on request - so they've got to maintain stock of
probably 10s of million Pentium classic CPU for warranty replacement.
Add it all up, there are lots of Pentium CPUs out there. There are even
more PIIs and Celerons in the field. Every single one of them can be easily
re-purposed as a router or a fileserver with a suitable Linux/*BSD reinstall.

This is one of the reasons that HP, Dell and the other server vendors
would like to remove and recycle old x86 hardware, rather than allowing
them back into the secondary market - it would cut into sales of new hardware,
which carry much higher pricetags and margins. So they offer good trade-in
deals on older hardware. Recently, they've introduced the E-waste meme to
try to pick up these systems for recycling (to them, naturally) rather than
let them get donated or resold in the secondary market (actually, they don't
mind if you toss the machine into the dumpster, they just don't want it to get
resold downstream). 

(There is a lot of E-waste generated, but PCs, especially after the early
90s, are not the major culprit. A single proprietary minicomputer like a
VAX or an AS/400 generates far more E-waste by weight and volume than even
several dozen PCs. And most of the minicomputer E-waste can't be reused,
unlike PCs. In a PC, the monitor can be reused, various parts including
the cables, drives and memories can be reused, the case can often be reused
or the steel from the case recovered, leaving only some cards and motherboard
as scrap. That's only about 5% by volume of the original system. Printers
and peripherals are another story - almost all their weight and volume
is scrap.)

I recently upgraded to linux-2.6.8.1 from linux-2.4.26.  But now the
memory (and swap) usage is more.

After boot 80 MB (out of 128) is used.  Usually it was 50 MB.

Here is `top` output

 1236 dictd     18   0 46164 4664  43m S  0.0  3.7   0:00.06 dictd
 1505 root       5 -10 43368  20m  31m S 12.3 16.5   0:04.83 XFree86

below dictd, xfree86 comes nautilus, ....

PS: I also experienced this problem with RedHat 8,9 and Fedora distributions.

bytes sent and received are logged at /var/log/messages
Sometime back, I wrote a short php script to parse the log file and 
compute total bytes sent, recd, day wise, and month wise.

Hi Ankit, 

I think you are trying to upgrade PHP in a box where the Apache2 was
installed as rpm.
Try installing Apache2 from src. It worked for me. On installing
apache2(httpd) from src , the apxs can be found in $PREFIX/bin/apxs.
The combination i used is httpd-2.0.50 and php-4.3.8.  I dont know how
PHP can be upgraded  when Apache2 is installed as RPM.

100 is max swap (for RAM > 128 MB)
0 is no swap (for RAM =< 256 )
default is 60.

Message-ID: <20041004090519.30733.qmail@web41704.mail.yahoo.com>

I am having a Redhat Linux 9 connected to the internet using a Cisco 1700 series router. I want to copy the IOS image from the router to the Linux server using tftp. I enabled the tftp service in the Linux server by editing the tftp file in /etc/xinetd.d and then set the disable to no and then restarted the xinetd service. but when i put nmap localhost I don't find the tftp server running. Also the router is not able to reach the tftp server in the linux server. but when I did this thing for telnet service and restarted the xinetd service it is running. 

How do I start the tftp service in my linux.
Plz reply

Message-ID: <41612A88.5010804@symonds.net>

I run Debian and recently I got Sify broadband connection. If the ethernet card is in 'autonegotiate' mode, the link is not detected properly. If I change the configuration to '10BaseT Half Duplex', it works fine. I have nVidia nForce MCP. Previously I was using the 'forcedeth' module in the kernel. But I was not able to change the speed configuration using 'mii-tool'. So, I started using the module 'nvnet' (properiatry). Every time I boot into Linux, I would manually set the speed to '10BaseT HD' and then I will connect to the internet. Is there any better way to get it working automatically?

PS: In Ubuntu Linux 4.10, it is working by default. It uses 'forcedeth' module.

My guess is that the usb module is not loaded.
You can
1. Switch to console during installation; find whether the usb
module is loaded and load it if not (google).
Or
2. I think there should be some be some option 
wherein you can load the modules you want soon after
the install process starts.
(It is long since I used redhat. so i am sorry ; i can't remember; i
remember debian installer carrying such
an option)
Or
3. I also have a wild idea running through my mind that involves using
dd to do a bit-by-bit copy. I am not sure.

I am sorry for missing out an information. The candidates should have

  Hi,

   snmp is the way to go. Once snmp is configured, you can use mrtg (mrtg 
can be used with out snmp also.)

   ifconfig eth0|eth1 | grep and cut appropriate. which is a solution for
   one m/c but for large networks, it is snmp and appropriate OID.

Did anybody sucessfully using the eroaster in Mandrake

tried. It detects my cd drives but fails to burn and
gives error message.

unable to read /dev/sg* etc.

I understands no scsi emulation is necessary under
kernel 2.6.*.*, and the 
K3B cd burning program is working fine in Mdk 10.

How to make the eroaster work in Mandrake 10?

Message-ID: <3779a1e704100503406cb1e455@mail.gmail.com>

Whenever I am trying to introduce GNU/Linux to a new person, after explaining 
all the great features, the one immediate question they ask (may be to hide
their ignorance) is 

1. If it is so good, then how come everybody (they know) is using windows.
My usual answer is that GNU/Linux is catching up and already has a 
significant server marker share... blah blah blah.

'blah blah ..;' - because this fact alone seems not to be impressive
enough to the other
person in most cases. So any other (convincing) answer.

It is even more irritating when I am posting some technical article in
a group (our college)
and some stupid ass comes over and asks... if windows is so bad; how
is it the most
used os in the world then. I know that it is not by choice.

The thing is I don't want to waste my time engaging in a ramble/flame war with 
these lazy asses, who did n't care to venture beyond the
default/defunt . So if there is any authoritative article which would
nail the point...please share it.

Or should we leave it to pull. Pushing info/advocacy does n't work. Is it?

Sorry son, they've been preloaded.
And that explains the desktop market share for Windows.

I agree to the fact that Windows 9x is a good performer as a desktop.

People use Linux as a symbol of their freedom of choice and so as not 
to be dependent on an Organization whose motives are driven by the
NYSE.

What others use should never be an issue with a Linux user.
Exactly why, flame wars are useless.

Your duty as a GNU/Linux user is to spread the message and let the other 
person choose. 
It's left to the individual to choose what he thinks is best.
If after all this he thinks Windows is better , so be it.

For him, Ignorance is Bliss.....

The Linux developers are(were) never in a popularity war with any other
Operating System or an Organization. They do what they feel is right
and developments on other Operating Systems hardly matter to them.

If someone feels that an interesting development has taken place and it 
would do Linux a lot of good, they go ahead and port it.

The GOAL of Linux is "To develop the Best Operating System" and not 
"Develop a better OS than Windows".

Exactly. I agree. I have never engaged in one.

This is where the problem lies. For e.g. I was asked the question about the
popularity of windows.. when I posted the article regarding the 49.7
days uptime of windows. And this questioner is no newbie. (He did his
final year project in GNU/Linux.)
What I am worried about is the actual newbies out there. I have been
silent to a
couple of similiar questions that I am worried that these newbies may
take my silence for
inability to provide a valid answer and hence imply inferiority of GNU/Linux.

Hi Bharathi,

I would like to add 2 more items if time permits.
1. The video of nat friedman's talks at LINDEC 2004. 
       around 2 hours: 1 hour of his personal (hacker) history
             and 1 more hour where he and john demo beagle and some other stuff
2. The blender demo reel showcased in siggraph 2004
       around 6 min (but around 430Mb ; ultra high quality) of the
best animation  showcasing the ability of free software

I can bring both the video in my external usb hdd.

Were you are LINDEC 2004?

I was there too, I don't think we would have met.
How was the show, what did you feel about it?

*my two pence*

And, yes Beagle really was good, so I guess it should be a good addition to 
the Meet Agenda, *if time permits*.

The only problem ( I feel) with beagle is that its done in C#/mono
and stands absolutely no chance of making into the GNOME Desktop Environment.

Nat,Jon mentioned that Novell however *will* ship beagle with SuSe and The Novell Linux Desktop.

I am very sorry. We can't show both. We can show the 2nd one only. In 
the next meet, we will show 1st/Both.

Simply great. It has made me confident/comfortable with the idea of
contributing to
free software.

I too feel the same but for a diff reason. I know that .net standard
has gone through
a consortium... etc; but nevertheless.. when I saw something written in .net my
immediate reaction was... 'why.. why in the world would you do that?  do n't you
know where it comes from'. May be I am paranoid. But I am not at all comfortable
with the idea of using anything from MS's domain in GNU/Linux.
vfat,ntfs,.doc,.ppt...
should they be supported for the cause of transitioning/dual-booting
users putting
the future of the main app users at stake. My answer is a big no.

Hi,

hmm...
It was more of a Novell Conference than a Linux "Desktop" Conference.

No representation from the KDE people.
No representation from GNOME projects outside Novell.

I was expecting at least the Anjuta people to show up.

Yes, ECMA. Though Its certified by OSI but I doubt ECMA practices holds good within North America
and whether MS respects ECMA.

The Novell people seem to be confident that MS won't fight a legal battle.
That's the idea I got when I questioned them about licensing issues.

The problem is not with the current implementation of .Net .
Say, MS down the years comes up with .Net2 which is not ECMA-certified,
its then that the Novell guys are going to be left behind.
They will be faced to fork away or purchase an MS license.

I suggest you read Seth Nickell's reply to Miguel de Icaza when Miguel 
wanted mono/C#/Gtk# to be accepted as the  GNOME Development standard .

Find it on Google, "Seth Nickell Blog" should be good.

For the simple reason that you use Linux and others don't, you can't 
simply underestimate them. You were not using Linux from your birth. 
There should be a point of migration. SO YOU COULD BE LITTLE PLEASENT IN 
YOUR WORDS WHEN CRITIZING OTHERS.

First of all, (non-hackers) people tend to choose OS based on
popularity, they don't see the it's technical merits, they just want
their job get done.  Microsoft's business strategy helped to lay a
solid foundation for windows to bring this starting popularity.

May be you are right? I was running behind Microsoft products for a long
time. Even when I met people who were very strong in Linux, I wasn't
interested in using Linux because I felt they didn't have convincing
replies. My first question as a newbie was "What about user-friendliness in
Linux? What if I don't have a device driver?" 
Yet after a very long time, I have started using Linux. a thing I should
have done long back . anyways better late than never. 
  I am a newbie to Linux and lack any previous experience in it! In fact I
think this is my second post to the group! I am still struggling a lot to
use Linux effectively. forget usage I have not even successfully installed
Sarge in my computer. 
  I know Sarge is no game for newbies. But, as for the moment what I can
appreciate is things like GUI or the applications.may be some debugging
utilities and that's it. In all of these, Debian captured my attention. I
should say with the help of Praveen, a member of this group I have been able
to make very little progress. But, I am not leaving it. I am determined to
install sarge on my computer . because the volume of help I get for running
Linux is amazing. 
 If there had been someone with a convincing reply some years back, when I
posted all those silly questions, I would have joined the party, long time
before! A lot of my friends are out there not using Linux, because they
don't know its capabilities or its features. Can't ILUGC do something to
enlighten more people? Like inviting people other than the group members for
meetings or seminars? Arrange for a newbie section? Just an opinion!

Exactly. I agree. I have never engaged in one.

This is where the problem lies. For e.g. I was asked the question about the
popularity of windows.. when I posted the article regarding the 49.7
days uptime of windows. And this questioner is no newbie. (He did his
final year project in GNU/Linux.)
What I am worried about is the actual newbies out there. I have been
silent to a
couple of similiar questions that I am worried that these newbies may
take my silence for
inability to provide a valid answer and hence imply inferiority of
GNU/Linux.

Subject: [Ilugc] Regarding Serial Device access in Linux
Message-ID: <32b5ee76041005101917166ea@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Friends,
I have a Casio Cassiopeia PV 400 PLUS ( a palm viewer). Its
specifications are in the website:
http://casio.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=products.archivedproduct&CATALOG=Personal%20PCs&SECTION=Pocket%20Viewers&Product=PV%2D400Plus


It has sync-ing option with the PC with a software called PCSYNC. (It
is available in M$ platform only). I have initiated to (writing the
software for serially accessible device). I couldnt find any standards
for serial communication. I also have no exposure to serial device
programming. Can someone guide me. I presently have some idea as to
how to go about. Please correct me if i am wrong.

1) I first do some test receiving from the device and logged the data
as (#XX data). in windows

2) Now i repeat the same(send/receive) when i access the device in Linux.

3) Now varying the parameters in the data, (eg, by increasing the data
that i sync with the device) and logging them in windows, i try them
out and find what is the pattern by which the data transfer occurs,
what are the data bits, other bits etc.,.


( i guess this is (similar to) reverse engg).

Now my question is,
1) is there any better soln, is there any standards in serial
transfer. (or does anyone know any standard in Cassiopeia like the
standards of Palm Pilot Devices).

2) Can you pls tell me which is the best tutorial(that i can read
immediately and start prgming) and the best reference materials (to
keep as ref for long time). (I found a few of them, but most are
windows based, i also found a basic HOWTO for I/O commn, pls guide).

3) I tried to run the PCSYNC software in linux (wine) and see the
status of serial dev, however there is a communication error. Is there
any software for logging the data in Linux. (I tried statserial, but
it shows only whether the MR, RD, TD etc bits are on or off, but i
want a prg to get all bits transferred. I know that in linux we can
treat all dev as files, then there must be some way to do this using
files itself?(just a guess) ).

Thanks in advance.

Exactly. You have brought out the mindset of a lot of users. Normally 
migration to Linux depends on various factors like the person's 
willingness to face risks/challenges, time that he can spend to learn to 
use/customize Linux, the support he gets, finding alternatives for the 
frequently used Windows tools, etc. I have come across quite a lot of 
people who advocate for Linux. According to me, two basic qualifications 
for such persons are able to attract others giving reasonable answers to 
newbies/non-adoptors queries and the next being so important that being 
patient to the response from them. No one is in a compulsion to take 
your advocacy. He may ask some questions. Some being interesting and 
some being non-sense. But they do what they should. In my experience, 
people who ask a lot of silly questions started loving Linux a lot 
compared to the people who say it's nice and forget that from there.

Hi,
 My opinion is linux can become popular only with sufficient
push from corporates. Open-source developers contribution is
insufficient. The reasons are as follows.
 We should analyse how technology is evolving. The evolution of
technology is driven by need to improve productivity.
Productivity is useful work done by an individual in per unit of
time.
  Here is the sequence in which technology evolved historically
1. Manual labor was used for most work
   Industrialisation brought steam power and it replaced manual
labor.Later came electrical power to replace steam and heavily
replaced manual labor. Eg. Water pump draws water from well.
2. The decision making aspect and computational aspects were
done manually. Then came electronics and control systems that
relieved man of programmable decisions.Eg. U need not remember
to switch off motor for water pump.
3. In this phase, people had to write programs to make these
control systems act intelligently.Then came the quest to reduce
the lines of programs written.
   In this phase many approaches like object-oriented,
open-source came so that reuse could be high.
4. In the next phase, number of lines were reduced but people
were forced to know a lot about libraries and components to get
that re-use. Though the coding is reduced, knowing became more.
  In this phase, the quest came to find ways to get things with
minimum knowledge.
 
  Here came gui and others.

 Therefore future world, people's productivity is dependent on
getting more things done with knowing less. To be precise,
information-hiding. 
  End-users want information-hiding, open source developers are
against it. For example, Eric Raymond, in his book on hackers
culture and unix elaborates why hackers are not comfortable with
Object-Oriented approach.
  In essence windows does information-hiding from end-users
point but hackers work, OS or any other software generally does
not,but technically hacker's work is superior.
  Therefore some corporate entity needs to package hacker's work
and give it in a way that hides unnecessary information for
end-user.
  This we call as "user-friendliness"

V.K.Vallinayagam

The ``some'' corporate entity is Apple. I have not come across a more user

Since I spend a lot of time convincing people in the other direction

something with you. No article is ever going to convince anyone. Be it
Windows supremacy or Linux supremacy, you have to be like Morpheus. You can
only show them the door - its up to them to walk through it.

One approach that may help is that instead of talking about the competitor
and how the 'other guy' sucks, you'll be better off talking about why you
rock and why your OS is amazing. This is something I've learned over time
and has always helped me

  You may not be aware of the recent statistics from Andrew
Morton that show that over 95% of the patches to the kernel
now come from Open-source developers who are employed specifically
for that purpose by large corporates like IBM, Intel, HP, etc.
In other words, Linux is already being corporatized, like it or not.
Various other userland pieces also have similar corporate backing,
like gcc (RedHat), netfilter/iptables (Watchguard), and so on.

  Your notion that open-source volunteers are unpaid volunteers,
hackers, hobbyists or students in Universities was true in the
early stages of the GNU/Linux movement, but is no longer that
cut and dried.

  Again too simplistic - Some end-users want information hiding,
some what transparency. In particular, sysadmins and IT departments
generally prefer the latter, since it simplifies backup, migration
and general system maintenance.

  The notion that hackers are uncomfortable with OO methodology is
simplistic - this entire ecosystem of a billion+ lines of code could
not have been written without a structure. Whether you want
to call it OO or structured programming or modularity or whatever 
IT buzzword is currently in vogue is upto you, but most open source
users and developers don't care. All that matters is that the code
is correct; easy to read, maintain and extend; and interoperates
well (all of this applies to good FLOSS code, but rarely to
proprietary code).

Its not about Open source contributors buddies. The magic of windows
lies in the OEM (Original Equipment Manufaturer). The smart guy
manages to make every product manufacturer make drivers for windows,
while they pay money to keep the 'Strategical Partnership' with
Microsoft. Apparently, its coz windows makes their product sell
better. And in most cases its true. Most ppl use windows, so if they
make driver for it its gonna sell better. When I buy something new
from the market, I am not sure if  I may be able to use it with my
Linux, but I can be certain that it will work under windows.

The problem is the license. Most of them dont want to give away the
source code (they have every right to do so). Many have the wrong
impression that drivers got to be open source too. With LGPL and so
many variants of GPL, it is possible to release just the compiled
binaries. They could release binaries for just few popular distros,
and others can request for binary from their website. This kinda
concept needs to be given a push, but unfortunately the hard-core open
source enthusists wouldn't like it that way.

Good news is that, some manufaturers have started releasing drivers
for linux with their products. Esp in server side, its very common now
to get a SCSI adpater with rpm or deb package with it.

If more and more ppl start using Linux (which is the eventuality), the
manufacturers will be forced to give drivers that in turn makes linux
more popular. There cud be nothing stopping the linux at that time.
Open source is the way to go for a healthier, honest future.

At this point, however, the debate that which operating system is
better for desktop is still debatable.

One last point: Linux simply rocks!

Yes you can access any device connected to serial/parallel port using C
functions like open,read,write, close etc... which is treated as file.

Read the man page of "open" function.

All you need to know is the protocol messages for your device.

Hi Friends,
I have a Casio Cassiopeia PV 400 PLUS ( a palm viewer). Its
specifications are in the website:
http://casio.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=products.archivedproduct&CATALOG=Perso
nal%20PCs&SECTION=Pocket%20Viewers&Product=PV%2D400Plus


It has sync-ing option with the PC with a software called PCSYNC. (It
is available in M$ platform only). I have initiated to (writing the
software for serially accessible device). I couldnt find any standards
for serial communication. I also have no exposure to serial device
programming. Can someone guide me. I presently have some idea as to
how to go about. Please correct me if i am wrong.

1) I first do some test receiving from the device and logged the data
as (#XX data). in windows

2) Now i repeat the same(send/receive) when i access the device in Linux.

3) Now varying the parameters in the data, (eg, by increasing the data
that i sync with the device) and logging them in windows, i try them
out and find what is the pattern by which the data transfer occurs,
what are the data bits, other bits etc.,.


( i guess this is (similar to) reverse engg).

Now my question is,
1) is there any better soln, is there any standards in serial
transfer. (or does anyone know any standard in Cassiopeia like the
standards of Palm Pilot Devices).

2) Can you pls tell me which is the best tutorial(that i can read
immediately and start prgming) and the best reference materials (to
keep as ref for long time). (I found a few of them, but most are
windows based, i also found a basic HOWTO for I/O commn, pls guide).

3) I tried to run the PCSYNC software in linux (wine) and see the
status of serial dev, however there is a communication error. Is there
any software for logging the data in Linux. (I tried statserial, but
it shows only whether the MR, RD, TD etc bits are on or off, but i
want a prg to get all bits transferred. I know that in linux we can
treat all dev as files, then there must be some way to do this using
files itself?(just a guess) ).

Thanks in advance.

Hello Varun,
  Yeah in linux most of the devices can treat as files, So u can "open" it as a file, and u can send/receive data through "read" & "write" operations ....
See the man pages open ,read & write...
for serial port..the device name is "/dev/ttyS0" or "/dev/ttyS1"

Actually what u want to do??
mention it clearly...such that i can help you
                                                 Regards

Whole of free software isn't as popular as proprietory software,
because lack of advertising,marketing... and all other business
methods.

In view of lack of business potential[to make tons of money], the
only way Free software can be popularised is by personal contacts. In
the early days, the net wasn't as developed as it is now,
constraining development and tranmission. With improvement in net we
see Free software gaining popluarity. 

Rather than looking at popularity of two OSes we should think in
terms of clash of idealogy of Free/Opensource vs. Proprietory.

In the last two years of my talks at various colleges,corporates
etc.,
I think people apreciate principles to which Free/opensource stands
for than simple popularity.

Let's not bother how popular Linux is, let's bother about its
purpose.

Few members are interested to give the newbie sessions. But we need

this time to build the "Newbie Session" Team. 

Volunteers Plz standup and form a team :)

I dont. I consider them superior to me in their coding ability. i am
just a guy who
can go blah.. blah.. abt gnu\linux.
Infact I have a couple of .net geek friends, who dont care a damn abt gnu/linux
and i am ok with that. i have seen them code and have admired their
coding ability.
but this guy got me on the hook because he had used
gnu/linux in college and i remember him taking about its merits.
but now i am confused/angry with him asking the question...
he does n't need the answer; i bet he already knows it.
as i said earlier it is the newbies that i am worried abt.

>You were not using Linux from your birth.

this is one of the dumbest replies i have ever come across.

> There should be a point of migration. SO YOU COULD BE LITTLE PLEASENT IN
> YOUR WORDS WHEN CRITIZING OTHERS.

so can you stop yelling when criticizing others.
(you know... we can go on and on like this.)
but you know what else made me so angry...
i dont consider gnu/linux as just technically superior.
it is a practical representation of the idealistic society of mutual
co-operation that many
great men dreamed of .... and that i love to be part of.
so what is going on now is kind of a freedom stuggle to me.
(you can call me a fool).
so before 1947 if i called someone who is neutral to british as lazy
bums ... would it be
too much. i dont think so. it is not about people who cant. 
i dont have a word for them.when such people come to be for help (for
eg on buying a computer), i have never spoken about gnu/linux. i know
it does nt help either way.

I used to be of this type till a year back. when ms didnt consider
gnu/linux as a
threat (or atleast didnt go abt it in public) and we were left in our
own domains.

but with all the wrong ads and other info/stats that they are bringing
abt the place..
an eg http://www.corporatewatch.org.uk/newsletter/issue13/issue13_part1.htm

i believe it is a moral responsibility of people who know the truth to
go about telling it.
and what better is a place than a college comp sci student grp ...
ripe with newbies
stepping into the world of computers

Sorry for the delay in positing this.

With help of Saravanan from Lucas-TVS ILUGC organised a talk in RMK
Engg College. Me, Saravanan and Suresh Babu from lucas, went to RMK.
The Dean Prof.Chandrasekar was very much interested in Opensource and
was instrumental in organising this. I made a presentation for about
one-and-half hours. It was mainly to IT and Mech.Students. About
300-350 students were there. It was followed by a question answer and
interaction sesssion. The students were impressed by the principles
to which Free(dom) software stands for and are eager to learn and do
project with/in it.

The Dean is organising a Linux Interest Group in his college. I
promised all possible help from ILUGC. He also agreed to organise
one/two day seminar in his college during January. ILUGC has to give
the format and spot the technical resource person for this. RMK engg
will take care of logistics.

I will followup on this and post the status.

what i meant by this was it doesnt help either gnu/linux or the user who simply

this is not  a preconceived opinion.
while i was wildly enthued abt gnu/linux 3/4 years back... i used to
recommend all
people gnu/linux. every place where i knew i had a say. i would spend most
of my weekends driving over to people's houses and installing gnu/linux.

but over time i learned that this method (push) does n't work.
people were n't ready to go all the difficulties that i took for granted.
so i stopped it.

but now seeing the improvements in usability i am giving it a thought again.
no no.. pushing does nt work.
or does it.

Hello,
       Go through the serial device programming for POSIX operating system
guide located at http://www.easysw.com/~mike/serial/serial.html.


     /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyS1 is your serial device (equivalent to COM1
and COM2 in windows).
        First you have to set baudrate,stop bit, number of bits,parity all
those things in your program(the guide above says how to do it) as per the
specifications given in the manual of the product.
   you can use read and write syscalls to send data and read data from the
device.

Similar to hyperterminal, you have an app called cutecom in linux. First
you check
whether the device is responding to your protocols(#XX command) i.e you
get any reply from the device in response to this command.

Great! Well the answer for my question anyway is "NO", right? I adapted Linux in 1999. Before that I was using Windows. Even now I (am forced to) use Windows at my work place. There is a clear distinction between the policies and profession.

Hey Varun,

               Well the serial devices in Linux would be /dev/ttySX or
USB serial /dev/usb/ttyUSBX, /dev/ttyUSBX.
 
To read / write from a serial device, open the serial device as a file
handle/descriptor, you could set permissions whilist the "open" 
call.There are different modes of reading from the serial port -
Canonical,non cannonical and the asychronous mode(Signalling). Writing
would be relatively easy,but reading from the serial port can be a
little shitty unless you really know what you want to do, you will get
stuck whilist reading characters in Raw mode. The Termios is used for
setting the serial port parameters.

Take a look at this guide for programming in different modes,

http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Serial-Programming-HOWTO.html ..

use minicom (teminal) or Tip or even write a small terminal code for
debugging thro serial ports,

Alternatively u can use this code for a start , 

//Author-G.Bharath
//Co-ordinates - g.bharath@gmail.com

#define COMPORT "/dev/usb/ttyUSB3"  //SET PORT PATHNAME HERE
#define MAX_CHAR 1 //No of chars to be transmitted

//File Handle

int fd; //file descriptor 
char recvd_char[2];
//Terminal settings

struct termios tiop;

int Init_Com_Port(void)
{

	fd = open(COMPORT,O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NONBLOCK);
	
	if(tcgetattr(fd,&tiop)<0)
   	{
       		printf("Error getting terminal settings ERRNO %d \n",errno);
		return(-1);
       		//exit(0);
//Alternatively get and store attributes to a differnt termios
structure so that
// you can restore the old settings when u app quits!

   	}
   
           //terminal settings
	
	//Set Baud Rate to 19200
	cfsetispeed(&tiop,B19200); //Set printer port speed to 9600
	cfsetospeed(&tiop,B19200); // input and output
	
	// set No parity 8N1
	tiop.c_cflag |= (CLOCAL | CREAD);
	tiop.c_cflag &= ~PARENB;
	tiop.c_cflag &= ~CSTOPB;
	tiop.c_cflag |= CS8;

	//Disable Hardware Flow Control
	
	//tio.c_cflag &= ~CNEW_CRTSCTS; 
	
	//Raw Input mode
	
	tiop.c_lflag &= ~(ICANON | ECHO |ECHOE | ISIG); 
	
	//deselect cannonical ,echo and signal modes
	
	//Disable Software Flow Control
	
	tiop.c_iflag &= ~(IXON | IXOFF | IXANY);

	//Raw output mode
	
	tiop.c_oflag &= ~OPOST;

	//tiop.c_cc[VMIN]  = 0;
	//tiop.c_cc[VTIME] = 1;
   
	if(tcsetattr(fd,TCSANOW,&tiop)<0)
   	{
   		printf("Error in storing terminal settings ERRNO %d\n",errno);
		return(-1);
	}

	
	return(1);
}

void transmit_char(char *ptr)
{
	write(fd,ptr,MAX_CHAR);
}

void get_char(void)
{
	unsigned char byte_recvd;

	do
	{
	   byte_recvd=read(fd,recvd_char,1); //Read until one char is read
	}while(byte_recvd<=0); 

//copy recvd_char[0] to your mem buffer .....
//Make sure u give a char pointer to the read call it expects it
}

to use signals use the code in the tutorial,if u really want
Asychronous data transfer,

Very true. And this is a problem with Windows operating systems today
(though to a lesser degree on Win2k3). Microsoft does know this and is
planning to fix this with their new command shell called Monad. Before you
start flaming me on how this is a clone of Unix shells, do read up on it
first.

Then tell them your side of the story by showing other statistics. Do you
really expect Microsoft to run ads saying "switch to Linux"? Show the
newbies statistics on your side. And don't call them asses..or any other
derogatory term. 

When people ask me stuff like "Is there really a 49.7 day limit in
Windows?", I feel like banging my head against the nearest wall. But I
usually sit down and patiently explain the truth to them (that this *was* a
rare problem with Windows 98 - which was released 7 years ago).

Calm down. Argue with technical info. And do realize - its not an issue of
life or death

Hey - no fair. Spies get those gorgeous girls and Aston Martins and have

They are talking about a machine that was running antique and un-updated 
OS versions.

You may want to browse through the archives of Dave Farber's IP list to 
get a lot more details than that article provided.

Sriram is basically right in that a lot of windows' faults can be put 
down to stupid admins or users in charge of windows machines - but yes 
it does have a lot of faults, without blaming random other nonexistent 
faults on it.

Our meetings are not closed. All are welcome.

Our list and meetings are so open that even Microsoft Employees are
participating in it.

As a first step on your opinion can you please arrange for seminar in
some college or other institution?

Let us start doing than debating.

Installing postgresql will require some experience in basic linux
administration. Judging by your email, I personally feel it would be
better if you asked one of your friends to help you out. Or you can use
a postgresql over the network if you are in a networked environment and
if it is available on one of the machines in the network.

And by the way, it is `rpm-qa | grep stuff` and not "\" as you had
specified; about the 'where to type' question, you need to type this in
any place where you can see a shell prompt. Possible places in a GUI
environment are Konsole, xterm, kterm, gterm, rxvt, et al.

Sorry, I wasnt very clear.
Let me put it  this way. The palm viewer that i am speaking of has a
software for windows, that can sync the contacts, memos, scheduler
remainders etc., etc., in the device with the PC. I have the cradle of
device connected to  /dev/ttyS0. There is/are not software for syncing
with PC in GNU/Linux. I am currently now writing the software for
linux, by logging all serial port traffic in windows and then trying
to mimic the same in linux, and then trying to alter the data sent to
the device. I tried this because, there are several standards for the
Palm Pilot etc devices, but the casio corp has not provided any white
paper as to how the serial communication takes place( or i have no
knowledge of such a paper, i searched their website, but found only
manuals of how to use the palm viewer).

I have logged the data in windows, which i have as #xx form of hex
data. I am trying to analyze the data, see what it may mean. Let me
show you the text.
all hex alternating send and receive.
#18#30#30#30#30#30#30 > this is what i receive.  (does #18xxxxxx has
some meaning-like it will always be received when i open a serial
port?. )

#06#30#30 (this is the data that the PCSYNC windows software sends to 
the palm device, alternating).

#01#30#31#30#43#38#31#31#30#31#30#30#30#32#30#31#35#33#41->this is

Now what i am planning to do is to send the same data to the palm
device in linux (ie., open the serial and send this data and see how
the dev reacts). Now one more question.
Is there any difference between serial communication in windows and
linux ie., any change in control chars. If so, can you tell me what
should i do so that the device gives me no errors.
Thanks in advance

dumpstream does exactly that - dump the raw stream.

rpm -qa | grep pgsql instead of rpm -qa | grep postgresql

Where is the space after rpm? this command also wont run. and i think
that fellow pressed shift while typing |. its a typo. he might no have

Here's the basics of password protecting a directory on your server.

You'll need to create a password file. This file should be placed
somewhere not accessible from the web. This is so that folks cannot
download the password file. For example, if your documents are served
out of /usr/local/apache/htdocs you might want to put the password
file(s) in /usr/local/apache/passwd.

To create the file, use the htpasswd utility that came with Apache.
This will be located in the bin directory of wherever you installed
Apache. To create the file, type:

htpasswd -c /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords rbowen 

htpasswd will ask you for the password, and then ask you to type it
again to confirm it:

# htpasswd -c /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords rbowen
New password: mypassword
Re-type new password: mypassword
Adding password for user rbowen 

If htpasswd is not in your path, of course you'll have to type the
full path to the file to get it to run. On my server, it's located at
/usr/local/apache/bin/htpasswd

Next, you'll need to configure the server to request a password and
tell the server which users are allowed access. You can do this either
by editing the httpd.conf file or using an .htaccess file. For
example, if you wish to protect the directory
/usr/local/apache/htdocs/secret, you can use the following directives,
either placed in the file /usr/local/apache/htdocs/secret/.htaccess,
or placed in httpd.conf inside a <Directory
/usr/local/apache/apache/htdocs/secret> section.

AuthType Basic
AuthName "Restricted Files"
AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords
Require user rbowen

Use checkinstall (replacement for 'make install').

try:
# which postgres

if the response is:
# /usr/bin/postgres
postgres is installed and in the same directory, you would find psql,
createdb, createuser etc.

If postgres was installed from an rpm package, try:
#  rpm -q postgres

postgres-7.0.2-29 or something like that would be displayed if postgres
is installed. Otherwise, you may have to do an installation.

You may also try browsing through the installed deb and rpm packages
using a gui tool like kpackage. HTH.

If you've done source install (untar, ./configure ; make ; make
install), you should try using 'checkinstall' instead of the 'make
install' command. This works on Slackware, dont know about RedHat and
its derivatives. It updates your package repositories so that you can
uninstall or get your package listed using package-specific commands.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

It works for .tgz, .rpm and .deb based systems.

I just tried using checkinstall. Actually it builds an
rpm using 'rpm-build' and install the rpm using ' rpm
-i' and updates in rpm package management. 

My Requirement:
---------------

If I install php with gd support, the packages like
gd, libpng,linjpeg.. to be installed before php
installation.Am I correct?
  So how do I precheck whether the above packages are
installed?

 'rpm -qa' , 'dpkg -l' are for binary packages only,
If the packages were installed using source, then how
do I know that? I don't want to install it again.

When we asked him questions related to Linux, he refused to answer.

  Andrew Tanenbaum? Yeah, it would have been nice if there had been
advance notice. But the guy is kind of low-key, and sticks to
academia - so only some CS people would have got to know.

I'll join your regret - I always admired Andrew's writing, and preferred
his Modern Operating Systems(humor in text books, anyone?) over the
CS-dept staple Galvin & Silberschatz. I would've loved to meet him :(

I got the info just 2 hour before the talk starts at ICSR, IIT-M. He
talked abt "The Globe" (http://www.cs.vu.nl/~steen/globe/).

AFAIK, He visited IIT, AU & MIT in TN.

Yes, but what has Andrew Tanenbaum (I guess thats the person you were
referring) to do with Linux at all ? Infact, even today, he doesn't seem
to like Linux as much because its not based on a microkernel
architecture :-)

Moreover, he's not as deeply bothered about the Free Software/Open

Hi,

On installing  the nvidia driver for fc3 test  ,a new module was
compiled for the kernel.On reboot, X server failed to start.When i
manually typed "modprobe nvidia" and then started X server , it worked
and the nvidia driver functioned well.
I tried adding modprobe to /etc/modules.conf and
/etc/modules.conf.dist but still during the boot process , X fails.
Any suggestions ?

Message-ID: <4166B4A6.5050709@eth.net>

May I request M/s Praveen & Mohanraj  to be soft in their expression ?

I am a middle aged man working as a Clerk in Canara Bank. And we are 
using DOS based softwares in our Bank. Slowly we are having Windows OS 
(Windows 2000). Although there is no necessity for me to have a PC in my 
home, I purchased one in 2000 and the assembler installed Windows OS. 
Neither me nor the vendor had any idea of  Linux or Open Source 
Software  at that time. Last year I heard about Linux  in newspapers. 
Accidentally I subscribed for LFY. It is thro LFY only I came to know of 
linux and its power. In the meanwhile my hard disk had to be formatted 
quite a number of times following virus attack in spite of having an 
anti virus program duly updated at regular intervals. Frustrated with 
this I decided to give linux a try.
Without any formal study of computers/software , I tried to install 
Redhat on my own. With quite a bit of  struggling, I successfully had it 
for a week.
Then Thro ilugc I chanced upon meeting Mr Balachander from Adyar who 
gave me Mandrake 9.2 CDs  and it was just a cakewalk to install MDK 9.2. 
Thro ilugc I contacted Mr Sridhar who gave me MDK 10 which presently I'm 
using.

I'd like to put before you all the following points:
1. A good number of computer users are non techies / amateurs who are 
guided by the assemblers / vendors who use mostly pirated Windows OS. We 
should find a way to promote news about Linux to these group of people.

2. Most  of these people including the assemblers won't waste their 
brain by using it by undergoing the tedius task of  insatlling linux. 
Instead they would prefer to insert the OS CD, run the setup program, 
give the serial number and relax.

3.Most of the elders and middle aged people buy computers as a status 
symbol and they don't use it at all and their wards are not mature 
enough to know of Open Source Software. It is the college students , 
that too in the engineering colleges, evince interest in linux. In most 
of  the offices, people do not know at all about linux. In my nephew's 
school in Tambaram (which is quite big and famous), the computer teacher 
does not know anything of linux. In a garment factory where I had gone 
to canvass, they were using Windows OS only and nobody was there who had 
ever heard of the word linux.

4. Even for those who venture out to install linux, there is proper 
guidance. Even after continuously using linux for the past 9 months, 
still I do not know the commands since I'm using it in the GUI mode 
only. The use of books is of little help as things are different in the 
books and in the PC.

It is my notion that most of the ilugc members are engineering students 
or software professionals and amateurs like are a minority. It would be 
nice, if somebody devouts a little bit of his/her time to conduct a 
class during week ends to help people like me to learn linux.

I hope some day somebody will come to my rescue .

Until then good bye.

this is a series of excellent points on why several people who are not 
techies / geeks / kernel hackers etc decide to make a shift to linux 
from windows.

just one point to add to his email:

as a matter of fact even the people who bundle linux preinstalled (acer, 
hp etc)

1. install an outdated version of linux like rh9

2. leave lots of space free on the disk - their install is at the most a 
base install of a few hundred mb .. 1 gb and the rest of the disk is 
unpartitioned.  they think selling a box with rh9 or maybe even pc-dos 
means they dont have to worry about MS chasing them with license audits, 
and most people buying it are buying it as a cheap system and will just 
install pirated windows 2k / xp on it later.

the rh install on the acer travelmate had several key drivers like 
centrino wireless etc not working] .. installing slak 10 and downloading 
/ configuring stuff, recompiling kernels for several days on end was fun.

so - you also need people to ship viable OEM installs of linux before it 
really becomes popular.

That's a good point. Before 6 months we purchased one system from a vendor.
I installed redhat 9 and the NIC has not working. You know what the vendor
told. He said the NIC was working when he tested it with windows and linux
has damanged the NIC. Panic!. I again asked him to demonstrate how NIC
worked in Windows. So installed win98(?) and it showed the NIC card. He
thought simply showing the device in the list is working. But it never
worked(when try to ping). Only then he accepted to change the NIC. So we
should have plans, before we teach them(vendors).

OK after that install Office. reboot. install antivirus reboot & install
abc, reboot, reboot???(This is only for Win98, which is still the most
popular OS among home users AFAIK).But in linux you can install all apps in
a single stroke. That's one more advantage i see. 

I have seen people who convert the linux desktop to resemble windows look &
feel. I think, they never want to change. If they like one they stick to it
and be happy with it whether it satisfies their needs or not(this is my own
opinion and please correct me if i am wrong).

I think end users(who know only windows) can easily use linux. This is from
my experience. i our office i recommended Linux and all systems have only
Linux(except 5 dualbooted with windows xp). When new people come they dont
find it difficult. I just show them the browser, the directory to store the
files, and the applications to work. They dont know the commands(and i
think they dont have to). It just works fine. After 9 months of work all
the users are happy. This is from my exp.

When common people use windows. If there is problem they call the vendor and
fix it. Using linux, they have no help, so have to do their own. I think
educating the vendors and assemblers will help lot in spreading linux to
common people. So that when home users come accross problems they can get
come help(for which they will be charged).

This can be done.
> I hope some day somebody will come to my rescue .
if you want any help reg. this please send mail off list. Already i
encourage and help many of my friends to use linux(they are all system
admins and ask help from their office).

i always wanted to come to lugc meets, meet u all and share my exp. But dont
find time for that. i wonder how you people manage your timings(any
suggestions?). i started thinking "am i less interested than them?"

How does one decide the level of difficulty for each of these lists?
10 bucks says no one will subscribe to the first two lists

True.  What  might appear  to  be  an  'expert question'  might  sound
'newbie' to someone else and vice-versa.

Though, ilugc-advocacy vs ilugc-help  might be useful.  For example, i
was not interested  in the 'popularity of windows'  thread and I never
came close to reading it completely. my 5 paisa.

The need for more mailing lists should be driven not by the difficluty but rather by the 
traffic that the main list generates.

Still,
I think we should have two lists ,

1.ilugc-tech
To cover programming, administration and networking

2.ilugc-general
Advocacy, LUG event planning, volunteering, announcements, newbie-help,installation etc.

This would provide a demarcation and reduce traffic, it would also filter down the posts and 
subscribers can choose better.

Don't split the list - it is good enough as it is.

Mr.Varahan's idea of newbie classes is a good idea though - what do you 
say to the idea that each LUG meeting from now on has at least one 
"newbie" topic - something like "set up redhat or mandrake, configure 
net access using kppp / wvdial, configure sound, etc" or "common 
problems encountered" like for example reinstalling winxp overwrites the 
MBR, etc

Its also possible that *almost* everyone would subscribe to all the
lists... which means, the lists become somewhat redundant!

It makes perfect sense to  me if 'newbie-help' and 'installation' goes
into ilugc-tech.

I agree with that. It definitely would help people like me who aren't

And how do you differentiate a question from "newbie" or "expert" ?

What you feel is "expert-level" might be considered as "newbie" for others.

It would be ok if the ilugc mailing-list focussed on a core technology like say
the freebsd mailing lists where freebsd-hackers is for kernel/system programmers
and freebsd-questions focusses on newbies/general help.

The only demarcation we can make is based on the topics and not on content.

newbie's qus has to answered by the experts and one day newbie should 
become a expert. So Here we can't separate like kernel mail list. 

May be we can separate ILUGC-announce list. But this will be possible
only if we have regular/constant set of volunteers. Otherwise there is
on use of ILUGC-announce list and we have to do the cross-postings.

Hi!

My thoughts below:

Instead of worrying about creating new mailing lists,
newbies must first participate in the current ilugc
mailing list. It is not bad to ask questions, but, you
should do your homework before asking questions. A
majority of questions are already answered and can be
easily retrieved from a search in
http://www.google.com/linux or browsing through the
archives of different mailing lists.

How to ask questions the smart way:

Dear friends,

         I am using smb4k (a share browser for windows networks). I
currently have two OS on my
system (Debian and FC1(PC Quest Version)) However the two systems show
different number of
workgroups on the network. In debian, if I use the network browser
that comes along with GNOME
 then it is able to show all the workgroups, but not able to open all
(almost none). It says that it is
unable to show all the computers on the network. Tell me the file
which I must mail you so that you
identify the problem or what is the solution to this problem. 

      Another strange phenomenon observed is that in FC1 if I search
for a particular workgroup
which I already know of, but not shown on the list, then at times it
detects the workgroup, but shows
it as unknown. That is it says connection to the particular workgroup
failed. It does this even for
certain workgroups that it lists by itself.

          I am trying to persuade all others in my hostel to switch to
Linux with some success. Many
people put linux in their system primarily because windows was having
a lot of virus and trojan horse
problems. 
     
 Bye!

  I recall reading that the minimum recommended RAM for FC2 is 192 MB -
not too sure why and where the bloat occurred.

IMHO, the list is to help the newbies (by experts). There is no point in 
having separate
lists. All experts where newbies .... at  some point of time. And the 
newbies will become
expert at another point of time.

Would be good if someone could take the effort of convert relevant mails to
FAQs maybe using FAQ-o-matic. Newbies would find it easier to navigate as
opposed to search by keywords.

Hi Bharathi & Sivasankar.  I was a little disappointed that you missed 
the talk on Calpp, because it would have been nice to have convinced you 
to contribute to the Calpp Project.  But, I would like to thank all of 
you for having given the opportunity, because many offered support to 
the Calpp Project, immediately after the talk :)

Before me, Hari talked about Zhakanini, the Tamil PC Project and the 
work done by Writer Sujatha, Siva and the other team members.  Kumar 
revealed that Debian has included the Tamil support from its web site 
last week.   Hari explained about using KBabel and other tools that are 
used to create the .po files that handle translation.  It seems about 
one lakh lines have been translated so far. Hari also shared his notes 
on the Indic Font meet that he attended at Mumbai.

When I started the talk on Calpp, I could not resist mentioning about 
the greatest contribution to legal jurisprudence, which is Avvayar's 
Athichoodi - the Tamil Needhi Nool.  It is well impossible to simplify 
the law any better: High ethics and morals can be taught to primary 
school children in the formative years itself. Avvayar's elegant and 
succulent Tamil maxims would beat its Latin brocard cousins hands down. 
"man parittu unnel" [gist of property law], "giam pada urai", "kandu 
onru sollel" [law of evidence], "ooram sollel" [be fair], "por thozhil 
puriyel" - "don't do the business of war" [the very essence of 
international law] are all worth heeding. Now, that forced me to start 
with an apology for Calpp:  we need to use computers to get back to 
those innocent times ;)

I started the talk with what a typical legal application might look 
like.  The legal procedures in about 90% of the total, are mostly well 
defined and structured, with the little balance lying in the grey area 
of doubt and philosophy. A major bulk of the law could be easily 
computerised with free software and good research.  I briefly explained 
Section 4 of the TN Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960 with 
reference to the javascript application at 
http://personal.vsnl.com/ramanraj/kr_tnfrc.html This is an example of a 
typical self-documenting legal application, and one can get a good feel 
of what coding the law would be like.  It includes data validation, data 
conversion, test cases, generation of reasons for the computation, along 
with all documentation required to manually check the result. Calpp 
could manage hundreds of such legal applications, and it could maintain 
the legal system with minimum effort.

I did not mention one of my itches for the Calpp Project: Several years 
ago, when a five year old school boy was walking back home, a reckless 
public bus driver hit him from behind, and as a result of the injuries 
sustained in the accident, the boy became a paraplegic, losing vital 
body functions below the waist.  He claimed 100k, as compensation, but 
was granted only about 25k.  In the appeal, it was doubled to ~50K. This 
was inspite of rulings that paraplegia is a condition worse than death, 
and had awarded upto 1200k as compensation. The unfortunate boy got his 
50k after several years of litigation and, after all that, the boy's 
guardians merely said, the boy is cheerful about his fate, doing well in 
his studies, and that he will stand on his own feet [ironically, the boy 
may never be able to do that literally]. The pyrrhic victory of 
"doubling" the compensation is of no solace, and even though many 
willingly accept life as it comes, it would be a shame if we did not use 
whatever we know and are capable of, to improve the situation around us.

Computers could efficiently speed up proceedings and help in rendering 
substantial justice to people in need.

More generally, law is common for all, and reducing the legal system to 
machine executable free code would benefit all.

Edsger W.Dijkstra said:

<quote>
For me, the first challenge for computing science is to discover how to
maintain order in a finite, but very large, discrete universe that is
intricately intertwined. And a second, but not less important challenge
is how to mould what you have achieved in solving the first problem,
into a teachable discipline: it does not suffice to hone your own
intellect (that will join you in your grave), you must teach others how
to hone theirs. The more you concentrate on these two challenges, the
clearer you will see that they are only two sides of the same coin:
teaching yourself is discovering what is teachable.
</quote source: EWD 709: My hopes of computing science>

After reading EW Dijkstra, I realised that, the Calpp project,
predominantly meant for "legal" procedures and proceedings, could be on
the path to discovery in the direction of the first challenge of CS.

Law is about maintaining order and peace in this discrete universe.  The
Calpp goal has been to find the easiest and shortest way to store and
run legal procedures and proceedings, wherefrom we could measure the
extent of peace and order in this universe, and hopefully control them.

Calpp is at present runnable, testable and one could play a lot with it
and use it as well to both write new procedures and run them as
proceedings.  For well defined procedures, it can generate the required 
forms, do data validation, data conversion, storage, report generation, 
and handle workflow with minimum effort. It has a good indexing system, 
that may not get simpler than what it is.

Calpp could look more neat, have more features, and have every useful 
procedure added to it.

While most legal procedures would require considerable legal research, 
sys procedures need expertise in computing. Many sys admin tasks could 
also be included as procedures.  During the talk, I suggested including 
procedures for writing the apache conf file,etc.  Unless one understands 
the logic behind the conf, it is almost impossible to write a useful 
procedure.

Please let me know if you would be interested in the Calpp Project.

Sorry I missed about what the meeting started with.  It was the talk 
about Randover by Arun Balaji. As I understood, it was about security 
through random queries from databases relevant to the user, and it could 
be used for securing anything from credit cards to computer systems. 
Random queries may be fine for machine to machine but, I am not sure if 
it qualifies as a scientific method of security.

Raman discussed about the Gnu/Linux Demo for IEEE @ IIT/Anna-Univ 
scheduled tentatively for 31-10-2004.  The systems would be arranged by 
IEEE, and volunteers would be required to install distros and give 
demos.   Please enlist as a volunteer immediately !

Ps: Raman, please fill in if anything is missing here.

It's not scientific and can be fairly easily bruteforced / broken

Dear All
Greetings !
It is a long pending and challenging project for me , for nearly 2 years.
I want to generate patterns of "KOLAM" [ the art work ]
i have tried it in VB , refering to Beasier curves and other curve related 
applications like knotplot. but it fails

i am unable to get a clue to generate the "generalized " "KOLAM"

let me give my requirements in layman's words

the application can have the following features

1) based on number of  "pullis" [dots ], it should generate KOLAM
2) the drawing speed should be controled
3) different colours are needed.
4) same KOLAM can chane the colour slowly
5) the size should be controled.
6) it should be effecient enough to use as screen saver.
7) scrolling msg can also come in between

and lot more.....

kindly help me to do or some of you can develope and leave the source code, we 
will enrich.
it can be developed in any other Highlevel languages , [ need not be in VB ], 
pref C++


have a wonderful day

You could develop a kolam extension for GIMP using Script-Fu
http://www.gimp.org

Writing to the gimp dev team, showing them a few kolams, and the steps 
involved in drawing kolams may yield good clues, and you may even have 
your done by someone who is an expert in Script-Fu.  Gimp supports Perl 
scripts also.

To get started on this, open Gimp, and under the Xtns menu, select 
Script-Fu > Console ... There is a DB Browser that displays several 
built in functions that could draw dots, lines and curves, change 
colors, introduce animation etc.  Good luck  :)

one feels that anwer to the question cannot be found in other
sources.
 If everyone spends his time educating another person thro
personal means like classroom or e-mail, it cannot be
productive. Books, electronic texts  are impersonal ways and far
more productive ways. Say one person spends 10 hours writing a
doc and 1000 people can read and get benefiited.
 There are enough FAQs, documents and other sources for newbies
in internet to educate themselves in linux.
  Moreover FAQ are older technologies. Wikis are more better.
  For reference, consult www.tldp.org, www.linuxquestions.org.
 www.linuxquestions.org has a wiki. For experts, here is my
suggestion. If someone asks a question, don't answer it. Just
show them a link in www.linuxquestions.org's wiki. If there is
no link in it, create a topic in that wiki and give its
reference.
 This way, many more people can be benefitted and it is more
productive.

V.K.Vallinayagam

Judging by the spelling and by the bad grammar this sounds like skript

I wonder if it would be worthwhile to pay the Rs.900 to just go and poke

On second thoughts, a complete waste of time and money.

Can you show us the _uncommented_ entries of /etc/lilo.conf ?

Check if you have an entry for XP as follows:

other=/dev/hda1
   Label=XP

Assuming that you wish to install Lilo on the MBR, make sure that you
also have the following entry in your lilo.conf file: 

boot=/dev/hda

Rerun /sbin/lilo once you've updated these entries.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

RH9 configures and installs GRUB as the default boot loader. Did you try doing 'grub-install /dev/hda' instead?

Please use the wikipedia, if any such terminology doubt arises.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurd

Basically it's a kernel like linux.

Hurd is still under development.

Hurd is not the kernel. Hurd is the set of servers that run on the GNU Mach microkernel.

I have a very old snapshot of Hurd (J2). It is too outdated. I will not download anymore newer versions untill Hurd overcomes the 1 GB limitation for thier partitions.

  This is another thing about the GNU project that's bound to irritate
a lot of people - Mach was originally developed by CMU and made available
under a CMU license that was BSD-like, and in fact required both a Unix
source license (from AT&T) and a 4.3BSD license (from Univ. of Cal.) as
pre-requisites. This applied to Mach 3.0 and earlier, and GNU contributed
absolutely *nothing* to this project while the work as done in CMU until
1994.

  Subsequently, the Univ. of Utah forked the code and continued development,
producing Mach 4.0, which has a GNU-style build environment, but again,
AFAIK, GNU contributions to the kernel codebase was still *nil*, and the
license remained the combination of AT&T, BSD and CMU, with additions.

  GNU then forked the Mach 4 codebase to produce the microkernel that is
now used in the Hurd project. There are some in-kernel device drivers
ported over from Linux, considerable documentation and a GNU-style build.
This is what goes by the name of GNU Mach, but the core microkernel remains
CMU-licensed, in addition to the other licenses, including the GPL, for the
GNU additions.

  By calling it GNU Mach, there is an insidious implication that the GPL
applies to the entire codebase. This is not true at all, and portions of
it may still belong to AT&T - this was never decided in the AT&T vs. Berkeley
consent decree that permitted free distribution of 4.4BSD (remember, only
4.4BSD-lite is legally unencumbered, not 4.3BSD).

  GNU's contribution to Mach is minimal - the fork of the Mach 4 codebase
is legally on very thin ice. There's no way that it can be safely released
under the GPL. The only way that GNU can resolve this issue is to drop Mach
altogether and go with another microkernel, like L4 or similar, which is
completely covered by the GPL. 

  Under the circumstances, even the act of naming the fork as GNU Mach is
legally shaky and should be considered unsustainable. 

-Siva

P.S. I'm not attacking the GNU project, which has brought us great code 
including gcc and glibc without which we'd be nowhere, but only the
nomenclature for this particular project to which GNU contributions are
relatively small.

Use GNU autotools - autoconf, automake, ....
http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/

You can do something like
./configure --enable-gui

I didn't understand, what you mean by "gdb to work under my GUI". Bcoz 
already GUI Front Ends (xxgdb and ddd) are avail.

If an existing non-Gnu project gets dubbed as GNU software and part of
the GNU Project, it means that the project receives support from  the
GNU Project Developers, adheres to the GNU coding standard, and it
certainly  would not mean that it was built from scratch by GNU Project.

Mach appears to have a very long history, and Utah University was the
last to maintain the Mach and the oskit fork.

http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/gnumach-doc/mach_1.html#SEC3 says:
"On May 27 2002, after the Gnumach 1.3 release, Roland McGrath merged
OSKit-Mach onto the HEAD of CVS making it the Gnumach 2.x mainline."

That settles the licensing issues, if there were any at all.

Dear All
Greetings !
It is a long pending and challenging project for me , for nearly 2 years.
I want to generate patterns of "KOLAM" [ the art work ]
i have tried it in VB , refering to Beasier curves and other curve related 
applications like knotplot. but it fails

i am unable to get a clue to generate the "generalized " "KOLAM"

let me give my requirements in layman's words

the application can have the following features

1) based on number of  "pullis" [dots ], it should generate KOLAM
2) the drawing speed should be controled
3) different colours are needed.
4) same KOLAM can chane the colour slowly

Is there any documentation available that details the design and
architecture of your proposed security system ? Is there a working
codebase of your project that we can install and test on our systems ?
We would also like to see some form of test cases to signify and
differentiate your proposed security system in comparison to the
existing security/authentication mechanism.

     ^^^^^^^^^^
This does sound a bit too ambitious. Can you throw us some light on how
"fool proof" is your proposed authentication mechanism ?

The problem is solved after prepending 'PATH=/usr/bin' to command line

hi all, 
   I have writen a C code which uses malloc(3) to allocate memory. The program is meant for running in background and is kind of a daemon. the program gets terminated by bringing to the foreground(this happens when it is attached to some terminal or when run in foreground) or by using kill. My concern is will all the memory allocated for it be cleared( it should rite?). if it gets cleared , then is there any function that i can use for using up memory even after the program is killed ( using kill), some function in C that allocates memory and which should be explicitly cleared?.

As for running it as a daemon, are you just using inetd / djb's
tcpserver, or writing a daemon, and using the initscripts to start it?

That's true. But insatlling a new software in linux is not an easy job.
For example, I installed
Opera browser in linux easily by using the RPM package. At the same
time, installing a new software using binaries is not that much easy.
I'll illustrate this with an example of my own experience.In MDK 9.2 I
had Mozilla mail client which had a very nice and easy junk mail control
mechanism. But in MDK 10 it has been disabled. By chance I downloaded
Thunderbird but could not install it using its binary. I could not
locate any help file in Thunderbird for that. After about a month or so,
when casually browsing thro' the KDE options, I came across an
application  by name ARK  with the help of which I could install
Thunderbird.

It all depends on the individual's taste & liking.  But once a person
starts using linux, I am sure he won't go for any other OS. Linux has
such a mesmerising effect ( at least on me).

this is okay for normal day to day work. But when you go thro' the ilugc

Hi Ananth,

All memory allocated by a program will be reclaimed by the system when
the program exits. But it is a good practice to manage memory well
within your program, freeing it with free() when the chunk of memory in
question is no longer needed. When you tell me its a daemon, I
understand it might be running 24/7. In that case, proper memory
management in the program becomes top priority, to avoid memory leaks.
It is also important to understand that on calling free() the memory is
not immediately returned to the system. The glibc functions do internal
buffering of the memory management functions....

Can you give us your lilo.conf file ( as Chandrashekar pointed out).
May be if you are unable to access the partition, one idea could be to
load some boot CD(like knoppix) and get the lilo.conf
file.(alternatively , if you have part magic or some software which
can browse files on ext2 partition (or explore2fs) )you can reach the
lilo.conf file and post to us. I guess this might solve your problem
of accessing the lilo.conf file.

Dear Friends

1. Is there any command line tool (like kudzu in Redhat Linux) to detect
the hardware and help to install the driver for the same in Debian?

2. When I load USB ADSL Modem driver I am getting error message of
kernel version mismatch. i.e this driver compiled for 2.4.18 but the
kernel is 2.4.18bf4. Can I change driver makefile or preprocessing flags
in driver to solve this issue or I have to compile the entire kernel.

   you can either install a 2.4.18 kernel, or recompile you driver, or 
   compile a 2.4.18 kernel. If you are sure that the bf4 patches to 
   2.4.18 kernel will not affect/interfere with your USB driver, then 
   you can also tweak the Makefile in the kernel source to remove
   the extra version and compile 2.4.18bf4 as 2.4.18.

Gimp 2.0 has Python-Fu (I cried out loud when I opened gimp2.0 for the
first time and saw this.)

>From http://docs.gimp.org/en/ch01s02.html :

Scripting

"Python-fu" is now the standard external scripting interface for Gimp
2. This means that you can now use Gimp functions in Python scripts,
or conversely use Python to write Gimp plug-ins. Python is relatively
easy to understand even for a beginner, especially in comparison to
the Lisp-like Scheme language used for Script-fu in ....

...The biggest drawback, for Gimp 2.0, is that the standard user
interface offered in Python-fu does not use the complete power of the
Python language. The interface is currently designed to support simple
scripts, but a more sophisticated version is a goal of future
development.....

....Gimp-Perl is no longer distributed with the standard Gimp 2
distribution, but is available as a separate package.

    Thanks Prakash, still I need some clarification:
    1. I have installed only the First CD of Debian. I don't find kernel 
source in that.  You mean to say, I have to install kernel source (from 
somether CD) for 2.4.18 and compile and install the same, right? OK. I 
will try that.
    2. Do I have any other option of installing the kernel without 
kernel source installed in my machine?
    3. Can I compile the ADSL driver module bypassing the kernel version 
mismatch error, without disturbing the kernel?

Message-ID: <20041013060849.34ACB1DB25C@www.ae.iitm.ac.in>

I've to provide access to an application using ssh. The application has
authorisation built in. I do not want the user to give two passwords. In
fact, I do not want users to have system accounts at all.

I tried sshd with PermitRootLogin without-password and this did not work. I
know the hazards of a open root login. The program will be the user's shell
in /etc/passwd thus denying him a shell.

Pointers/suggestions welcome.

Message-ID: <20041013060941.6FA112B2B86@ws5-7.us4.outblaze.com>

Hi All

Is it pssible to partition a hard disk and format it using a shell script.
For example, 
i connect a secondary hard disk /dev/hdb as a slave to my linux machine ( which already has linux loaded in /dev/hda )

Now i execute the script, the script should
(i) Partition /dev/hdb using some file system
(ii) Format the partition.

All these should be done just by executing a script.


I was thinking to use fdisk and mkfs to achieve this ?
Since fdisk requires user intervention, i don't know hoe to go about this.

Please help me in this regard

Thanks in Advance
Thirumalai

There  are  several  *fdisk programs around.  Each has its
problems and strengths.  Try them  in  the  order  cfdisk,
fdisk,  sfdisk.   (Indeed,  cfdisk  is a beautiful program
that has strict requirements on the  partition  tables  it
accepts,  and  produces high quality partition tables. Use
it if you can.  fdisk is a buggy program that  does  fuzzy
things - usually it happens to produce reasonable results.
Its single advantage is that it has some support  for  BSD
disk  labels and other non-DOS partition tables.  Avoid it
if you can.  sfdisk is for hackers only - the user  inter
face  is  terrible,  but it is more correct than fdisk and
more powerful than both fdisk and  cfdisk.   Moreover,  it
can be used noninteractively.)

The short answer -- use sfdisk.

Hi Karrupuswamy,

               If you have the 2.4.18bf4 source with you, you can
compile the driver without compiling the whole kernel. Just put this
driver in the /kernel-2.4.X/drivers/usb (or any folder), add a #define
MODULE to the driver source file (if it is not there), since you are
trying to compile for a 2.4, for 2.6 you do away with the MODULE
Macro.

make the driver from the /kernel-2.4.X folder

by make drivers/usb/usb-modem.c (just an example)

This should create a the module, insmod it should not create
problems.Put this in your /lib/modules if you need to modprobe it.Also
you can check for the module details using " modinfo ".

( Alternatively you can complie in the kernel tree, by modifying the
makefile, guess you wanted to do away with that)

Regards

Bharath.G

Dear Friends

1. Is there any command line tool (like kudzu in Redhat Linux) to detect
the hardware and help to install the driver for the same in Debian?

2. When I load USB ADSL Modem driver I am getting error message of
kernel version mismatch. i.e this driver compiled for 2.4.18 but the
kernel is 2.4.18bf4. Can I change driver makefile or preprocessing flags
in driver to solve this issue or I have to compile the entire kernel.

Linux/unix systems dont need 'defrag'. Its the way files are referenced
(using inodes, and inode tables) that aid nix systems in getting over
the 'split up data' and 'wheres the next free block?' syndrome.

fsck merely checks and repairs broken fs, doesn't relocate data like
defrag does. And yes, there *is* a 'defrag' utility, for linux, which
you can get from googling around. But it is not necessary.

If all the /dev/hdb that you are going to connect are going to be of
same size, then just `dd` the MBR of one preformatted disk and restore
the dd content to a new /dev/hdb each time the script is executed. You
can ofcourse run mkfs to 'format' the partition.

You can automate 'fdisk' using shell script. mkfs can also be run from a shell script.

I cannot use key based login as machines are remote and not in my Closed
User Group. Kereberos also requires some tinkering on the clients, is it
not? I'm looking at a server side setting that will allow root login (or for
that matter any user) without asking for username or password. If OpenSSH
does not give this option, does anyone know of any other SSH2 based server
that allows this?

Warm regards

AFAIK, it doesn't work.  I have subscribed to the
128kbps/500MB/router-rent plan.  Next month I will apply for a plan
change to 64kbps/unlimited.

Ealier they said that router option is not available for unlimited
plans.  Now when I enquired for a plan changed, they said ok (The
change will be only on their side, so I will keep using the router). 
You better try the router option and change to unlimited plan next
month onwards.

As the users in my office use only GUI mode. i dont see any reason for them
to go to text mode. They know only little commands like ls,cp,mv etc. But
use them very rare. They do everything in GUI.

In Windows too i dont see a normal user going to CMD(konsole?).

Since i take care of installation, config, updates etc. here at my office
the users may never know about the other commands. For them Linux is just
like windows without mycomputer, mydocuments ;-)

But for home users they are on their own and need to learn many things, as
the need arises.

Here is how you do this -

WARNING:
  This system is tested only with ssh and is untested with rsh.  I recommend
  that you entirely disable rsh on the machine that runs this.  In the worst
  case, someone can run arbitrary programs as user foo using rsh.  Definitely
  not something you want!!

1. Create a new user account with "adduser foo".
2. Set user foo's shell to your application.
3. Delete user foo's password with "passwd -d foo"
4. Ensure you have "nullok" in /etc/pam.d/common-password, otherwise users
   with blank passwords cannot login.  Note: introduces a potential security
   risk.

5. Create a ssh key pair for user foo eg. run "ssh-keygen -t dsa"
6. Copy ~foo/.ssh/id_dsa.pub ~foo/.ssh/authorized_keys
7. The authorized_keys file should contain a single line.  Add the following
   to the start of the line -
    no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding

When you run "ssh foo@hostname", your application will start immediately.
This should also work with putty, et al.

Note:
  This system is very secure and cannot be circumvented by running
  "ssh foo@hostname /bin/sh", etc.  In this case, the "/bin/sh" will be passed
  as a command line argument to your application.  Invoke your app through a
  simple shell script wrapper if this bothers you.


Using a similar approach, I run secure anon CVS without using the cvs pserver.

HTH,

Hi ignacius,

We have good progress about it. I am confident that soon we will have
solution (if anybody is successful with this modem type, as i have
mentioned below, it is nice to inform through this mailing list). Here
is the history.

I too have touchtel 64kbps ADSL modem. I have started installing it on
Debian 3.0.r2.
My modem is Conexant ADSL Modem of vendor id: 0x0572 and product id:
0xcb06 (You have to check yours from any Windows installation done by
Touchtel). I have two options of driver.
1. accessrunner driver
2. olitec Aethra StarModem driver

Now I am working on olitec driver.:
1.I have installed kernel source 2.4.18 and compiled with all PPP
modules (especially PPP ATM module)  in kernel.
2.Go the the olitec driver directory. Then compiled the e2.o (olitec
driver for conexant PPPoATM driver).
3.command: # insmod e2.o
4.command:  # ifconfig hsb0 up
5.command: ./dhcpcd hsb0
Now you should be able to see hsb0 device with IP Address of 10.0.0.3.
6.command: ping 10.0.0.2
ping should be successful
7. Go to http://10.0.0.2 from any browser.
8. Here you will be asked with userid and password. I entered as per
olitec documents and also tried userid/password given by Touchtel.   BUT
IT FAILS. :(  :(  Let us wait and  see..... :)  :)

Now I am working on it. Can anybody help me in this regard? anybody has
any suggestion?

I've done this. I could also set password auth off in sshd_config and
install keys. As I had indicated earlier, I do not have control on machines
that log in. Thus I need to work on a server-side only solution. I've
specified the program in /etc/passwd, know it is secure and that the user
cannot get a shell. The application users are not system users. Thus, I do
not want to use any system auth mechanism at all.

Hi,

Better give all solution on the basis of concepts and command line tool 
(No distribution specific or desktop specific GUI tool). There are two 
possibilities for this approach:

1 If the Interviewer is good in concepts and command line, you will be 
well judged by default.
2. If the Interviewer is not so good in these, he can't understand 
whether your answer is right or not. :)  :)

Both are advantageous to you! All the best,

Dear ashwin

linuxant.com sell (yes, selling.. not open source) for 56K PCI 
softmodems. But mine is USB ADSL modem of 64/128kbps. So this site can't 
help me in this regard. Anyway thanks for introducing this site.

1. What I have suggested IS a server side only solution.  There is no client
   config necessary at all - users will need to login using the "foo"
   username and without prompting for a password, your app will start.

   Set "foo" to something more meaningful like the name of your app.

2. You only need to create a *single* account for the application and all
   users will use the same.

Touchtel also provides an ethernet modem with their unlimited plans for home

Dear KaruppuSwamy,
 
Fine to see your mail.
Congrats for your effort and explanation.
I have a fedora core2 pc i.e., the kernel is 2.6.xxx that comes with fedora core 2.
Can i compile kernel source 2.4.18 in it?? is it possible or idiotic???
If so can i do the driver compilation in 2.6.xxx itself ah??
Will the driver work in fedora core2???
How can I help you in this regard???
Please reply with adequate info as I have no knowledge of kernel compilation...
Give the links for the modem drivers....
What details do you need for suggestions based on the modem...???
thank you,

Why should you want to say that when the header reports it?

This is the GNU/Linux mailing list you know that?  And nobody asked your
e-mail id.  Avoid such garbage posts.

Hello all,
We are using redhat linux 7.2 as MailServer.The users
check their mails 
using IMAP protocol.The problem is at one point,the
users are unable to 
login ,I see the following error message in
/var/log/secure
file as:
xinetd[363]: FAIL : imap service_limit from=.
Only on httpd restart the users are able to login.this
happens every alternate 
day.
I have default instatnces=60 in xinetd.conf.Should I
configure any more 
to increase the imap instance or is that some other
problem.Kindly suggest 
me a solution.

Thanks in advance,

Lakshmi.G

Message-ID: <5800e9980410150528b32fa7b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have successfully compiled Linux 2.6.7 on RedHat 9 and was really
happy to notice the increase in performance and responsiveness. X
Windows has become a lot more responsive.

However I am facing a peculiar problem. I have configured the system
for most IDE devices but yet my Samsung 40x CD-RW does not get
detected.

/dev/cdrom is not a valid block device. Any pointers.

Hardware as follows : Intel P4 1.7 GHz, Intel D845GLAD Motherboard,
128 MB DDR, Samsung 40 GB HDD,

In order to gain some more performance i had disabled the SCSI devices
as it was clearly mentioned that CD writing no longer needs SCSI
emulation. Also i was a bit skimpy while configuring USB devices as i
hardly ever use them .Hence the system does throw out some errors
while trying to load some USB drivers.

Also what i would like to know is what is the Cryprtographic API
support in the kernel for. Is it essential for generating random
numbers or using md5 and crypt kind of functions in languages like PHP
which provide inbuilt routines for these.

Hi Batfan,

1. CD Writer issue: Try loading "ide-scsi" from command line and then 
try. It should work. For me it worked in 2.6.18 kernel
2. USB drivers failures: a new /sys file system has been introduced 
which will have all USB device related data. You can try changing the 
/proc occurrence in the /etc/rc.sysinit  script with the /sys for USB 
related lines.

All the best

You basically need Lomboz plugin for your eclipse version.  Just
type eclipse[version] and lomboz in google.com or a9.com you would
get the link with download option in that page.

In 2.6.8.1 there is bug .. so that even SUID root is not enough to
make cdrecod happy.  So I used to start k3b as root and it works.  Not
sure whether the same applies to 2.6.7

I have been using a very old Gimp 1.2 "pre-release", and now I notice,
version 2.0 supports scripting with perl, python and script-fu.  Surely,
the basic tools for drawing kolams are available in Gimp. But writing a
workable script may be needlessly complex for the simple task at hand.

Probably, XaoS could also be modified to generate kolams of astronomical
size.

Even DOM and Javascript, may provide a good interface for drawing kolams.

But I wonder if any serious research has been done into _how_ kolams are
drawn by hand.  I have had the pleasure of watching very complex kolams
getting drawn.  Many of the designs and patterns are traditionally
passed down, but I doubt if there is any authoritative treatise on the
subject, though it is one of the 64 arts [48:"art of framing mystical
diagrams"]. Documenting the basic syntax, grammar and rules of kolam
drawing along with its traditional terminology may prove useful.

Probably the first step is the draw the dot grid, for which it would be
worthwhile to create a standard notation. [XaoS could do without dot
grids] The next would be to start mapping a route - either using
formulas or by hand. The game is that dots are laid in a grid, and are 
"captured", and the final design has to be symmetrical to qualify as a 
kolam. The more complex the pattern, the more its "share value".

The closest thing I have done to a kolam program is the chess horse 
program at http://personal.vsnl.com/kr_chesshorse.html  It may give a 
few ideas on one approach for drawing kolams using a web interface.

Some Links that may be of use:

Perhaps Balachander migh have changed his first and last name for his
gmail.  And this mail's sender was added in your contact's list but
the names ('balachandar muruganantham') doesn't match with the one in
the contact list.

i found this url with mplayer.deb and all its dependencies and extras
in one folder
http://debian.tu-bs.de/mplayer/testing/main/binary-i386/

but howto apt-get from this url. adding it to sources.list does n't
help as apt-get appends the str '/dist/' to the sources.

have read the manuals of apt-get and dpkg. googled. but nothing so far yet.

I guess mplayer has some licensing issues.

I don't know about this source, but you can go to apt-get.org and search
for a source which provides a package. It also contains the line that needs
to be added to /etc/apt/sources.list.

Yep. I got the warning.
And, his id is not in my contacts list.
May be it is because a mail with a GMAIL-ID in From, 
was received from a IIT-M server.
Just a wild guess. I'm really clueless.

Message-ID: <ckqvgs$ftg$2@sea.gmane.org>

Hi list,

I am starting out to configure a server hosting a site, with email(webmail)
service. In  future the server may also run discussion forum(plone).

What i have in mind is, to install White box, apache & qmail for now.
Will it be a secured system(if i configure iptables in that)?
Since white box is based on RHEL, that arises the question of frequency of
the updates.

Should i for some other distro(SuSE/Debian)? As the system is going to be 24
hours online, i am very much concerned abt the security issues.

Can some one recommend a OS that will best suit my purpose? Or is my choice
ok?

Hi,

If you asked around for a distro for a particular purpose, you'll get
many different answers based on the experience of the people to whom you
are asking! Considering security top priority, I suggest you try either
Debian or Gentoo. Gentoo works on a similar package management system as
Debian but its source based. You also do not have to fall into
dependency hell, as the "emerge" package management system does all the
dependency resolution and installs all the necessary software. Regular
security updates are available as well.
Installing Qmail On Gentoo can be a breeze. Gentoo System are stable as
too(read 24/7).
Debian is know for its rock solid characteristics. Here too security is
given top priority and you can update security patches once in a while
and be safe.....

Thanks ; that helped. 

But I still would like to know if there is any way to do it from some
arbitrary source.

My hdd is 10.1G( thats what is printed on the metal cover).  So that
makes it  ~9600M. So what happened to my ~700M. Any suggestions.

Thank you,

For ILUGC's sake, please think a few times before sending in an OT
post.  Tagging a post [OT] does not make it acceptable to post a ton
of irrelevant messages to the list.

I've been watching posts on the sidelines and am increasingly
frustrated at the volume of absolutely irrelevant emails.  This post
just broke the camel's back.

I know this is not an exact solution, but Lomboz didn't work for me
either on Eclipse. Did you also install EMF(http://www.eclipse.org/emf/)
? It should be installed before you install Lomboz. It still didn't work
for me and I couldn't figure out why. Unless you *have* to work with
Eclipse, may I suggest jEdit (http://jedit.sourceforge.net). It's a lot
leaner than Eclipse, syntax-highlighting of JSP is done by default and
and there are a lot of plugins, you won't miss any functionality.

But if you *can* afford big money you can always go for IntellijIDEA
from JetBrains (http://www.intellij.com) which is somehow, acknowledged
as the best Java IDE around, hands down. But I'm happy with jEdit, it
works for me (I've given up trying to convince Emacs to become de-facto
Java IDE for me. Now don't show me JDEE. Been there, done that).

My opinion,

Writing a good GUI layer over Emacs (gtk2 is in gnu emacs cvs) with
excellent UI is what is needed now.  Emacs is extensible with Lisp and
I have started learning Common Lisp.  After learning Lisp, one will
gain some special programming skills that is worth even if he is not
going to program ever in Lisp.  And it will help me to use (my next
favorite) Emacs editor effectively.  The day when I would switch to
Emacs from Vi is not so far.

Spam comes in a variety of forms, including fraudulent messages. This
mass-messaging is called 'spoofing' or 'password phishing.'

Such practices involve sending messages that appear to be from a
legitimate source and/or creating an official-looking webpage that
asks you to provide your username and password, or other personal
information including your Social Security number, bank account
number, PIN number, credit card number, mother's maiden name, or
birthday.

Spammers often ask for this information in an attempt to steal your
Gmail account, your money, your credit, and/or your identity.

Google is currently testing a service designed to alert Gmail users to
messages that appear to be phishing attacks. When the Gmail team
becomes aware of such an attack, the details of these messages are
used to automatically identify future suspected phishing attacks.

The result: when a Gmail user opens a suspected phishing message,
Gmail displays a warning.

Gmail's phishing alerts operate automatically, much like spam
filtering. Gmail's spam filters automatically divert messages that are
suspected of being unwanted messages into 'Spam'. Similarly, Gmail's
phishing alerts automatically display warnings with messages that are
suspected of being phishing attacks so that users know to take care
before providing any personal information.

You should always be wary of any message that asks for your personal
information, or messages that refer you to a webpage asking for
personal information. If you receive similar messages, especially from
a source claiming to be Google or Gmail, please do not provide the
information requested.

Here's what you can do to protect yourself and stop fraudsters:

    * Make sure the URL domain is correct, and click on any images and
links to verify that you are directed to proper pages within the site.
For example, the Gmail URL is http://gmail.google.com/ or, for even
more security, https://gmail.google.com/. Although some links may
appear to contain 'gmail.com,' you may be redirected to another site
after entering such addresses into your browser.
    * Always look for the closed lock icon in the status bar at the
bottom of your browser window whenever you enter any private
information, including your password.
    * Check the message headers. The 'From' field is easily
manipulated. There are several online tools which will help you verify
the source of a message. To view the header from a message in Gmail,
open the message, click 'More options,' and then click 'Show
original.' Copy everything from 'Delivered-To:' through the
'References:' line. To get headers from other webmail or email
providers, please refer to this page:
http://www.spamcop.com/help_with_headers/.
    * If you're still uncertain, contact the organization from which
the message appears to be sent. Don't use the reply address in the
message, since it can be forged. Instead, visit the official website
of the company in question, and find a different contact address.
    * If you enter your account or personal information as a result of
a spoof or phishing message, take action quickly. Send a copy of the
message header and the entire text of the message to the Federal Trade
Commission at uce@ftc.gov. If you entered credit card or bank account
numbers, contact your financial institution. If you think you may be
the victim of identity theft, contact your local police.
    * Gmail doesn't send unsolicited mass messages asking for
passwords or personal information. If you think your Gmail account has
been compromised, contact us at gmail-abuse@google.com. Please include
the header of the suspicious message and the entire message text.

You can install whatever packages you want. What is
important is what packages will serve your
requirements than worry about security. Linux is open
source and you are not likely to face any security
issues. Atleast, I haven't faced any, or worried about
any issues.

This is good for experienced or determined users, but to attract
newbies and for starter experience a good GUI is essential and current
one is not that good (compare the GUI of IntelliJ and Emacs [1] )

[1] Projects 'cedet' are nothing but ugly hack when it comes to
rendering (they should use API like gtk+ for GUI, not some ugly X11
draw hack)

emacs is not really for a newbie, you know... It might seem a little
snobbish (or a lot, for that matter), but it's really meant for those
people who are already comfortable with the keyboard, or who want to
learn to use it effectively. A do-it-all GUI would really defeat the
whole purpose of emacs. Besides, it might just prove too complex to
integrate it into all that lisp code...

Everything is good about Emacs, but the point is it doesn't support
anti-aliased fonts or even have a good set of fonts.  This might be 
because it runs on many operating systems that don't have support for
anti-aliased fonts, etc.

But, Emacs can probably detect the OS and the font support and make use
of it.  Probably like Mozilla/Firefox.

There  was  apparently   some  point  of time  when   RMS was asked if
emacs should  use gtk2.  RMS dropped  the idea of  having to  use GTK2
since they have already  written all of those input/rendering routines
themselves.

Book Review: CODE Reading -- The Open Source Perspective

As a software developer most of the time, we spend adding new features
or functionalities in the existing code, written by somebody else. I
realized this after I joined Industry. Till date I hardly written any
code from scratch completely after I entered corporate environment. In
schools, colleges and Universities, all they teach us is how to code
using programming languages like C, C++ etc. Nobody teach us how to
read other's code. Infact that is what more important in a practical
point of view.

The following book which I am reading right now for the last 2 days,
is exactly teaches us How to read other's code? I should say, all the
software developers must learn this art. So if you find the time, go
and get a copy of this book and read it by all means.

CODE Reading
The Open Source Perspective

by

Diomidis Spinellis

ISBN: 0-201-79940-5
Addison Wesley/Pearson Education, 2003.

The author uses numerous real world examples to show us how to
identify good & bad code: how to read it, what to look for, and how to
use this knowledge to improve our own code.

Judgement: It is worth spending time to read this book in its
entirety.  You will write better code if you make it a habit to read
good code.

I would like to have features of Mozilla/Firefox available in Emacs.

XEmacs manual says it could be "inserted" into other apps. If any kind 
of easy integration is possible, it would mean that most W3C specs along 
with javascript and other things that are well supported with Mozilla 
would work just as well in Emacs.

Is there a way to do a partial post or get in web forms?
Sometimes, I need to get or post without submitting the entire form.

Thanks,

What do you mean by partial post? If you want to send only some of the form
values, you could do that by constructing your own query string for 'get'.
This is of course if your server script is equipped to deal with such
things. I'm curious though - why do you want to do this?

I really don't agree - the productivity gains of Emacs comes from the
keyboard. If you're using the mouse, you're better off using something else

To get an idea about partial get, visit:
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html

Partial post or get would help the same way a patch helps.

There is nothing novel about this.

A tcl/tk script could do this:

set so[socket quote.yahoo.com 80]
set q "/d/quotes.csv?s=MSFT&f=sl1dlt1c1ohgv"
puts $so "GET $q HTTP/1.0\n\n"
flush $so
puts [read $so]

If JavaScript could do the same, it could be made to do only a partial 
get or post (so far the user is concerned), though for the server 
script, it would be a regular get or post.

PS: save the tcl script as getMSquotes.tcl or something, and it could 
give an update about the stock prices of MS  whenever run.

Are you  talking about  automated form submitting  methods or  are you
talking about submitting from your browser?

One thing to note is that lots of people write crappy code like:

if (!$variable1 && !$variable2 && ... !$variableN) { 
   # dont submit
}

so even  if you got  to partially submitting  a form, it might  not go
through because the code on the other end wont let you to!

Not really like that.  I would use keyboard always.  But I was talking
about IntelliJ (for eg.) users who are not comformtable (and
unconvincible) to use keyboard .. why not have a (useless for geeks
though) good GUI layer over Emacs and it is not going to affect the
work of experienced Emacs users anyways.

Emacs on windows - or any other app on windows - cannot help NOT using 
antialiased fonts, that's the default on windows :)

Emacs cvs provides gtk support - take a look at this blog entry + 
screenshot http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/2004/7/16 that also links to a 
note on how to build emacs cvs + gtk2 on debian.

That's only for the menus / window borders etc, not the editor buffer. 
So, this thread - 
<http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=slrn8c91df.onp.cwong%40localhost.localdomain&rnum=2&prev=/groups%3Fq%3Dhinted%2Bfree%2Bfonts%2Blinux%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26selm%3Dslrn8c91df.onp.cwong%2540localhost.localdomain%26rnum%3D2> 
should help you.  Basically says to get some of the microsoft supplied 
true type fonts (andale mono for example) and use them for your buffer 
font instead of the default (which I think is a rather ugly looking 
courier type font).

Are you able to get a connection out to the internet, first?

Like for example, do:

traceroute -n 203.145.184.13

then traceroute to some other ip -

traceroute -n 66.35.250.151  (that's www.slashdot.org)

see what you get .. maybe your dns servers are unresponsive?

Or is it that though the link goes up, no packets go out through your 
gateway?

  Thanks for your detailed logs - this should probably go into
a mini-HOWTO for Touchtel, which will be of great assistance
to folks who need to go through this again.

  Easy enough - just set up your /etc/resolv.conf with the
IP addresses of the nameservers (primary, secondary) provided
by Touchtel (this will allow DNS name resolution for hosts
that are not in your /etc/hosts).

  The script seemed to update /etc/ppp/resolv.conf, not /etc/resolv.conf.
I'm not sure of the implications, but maybe all he has to do is to
copy the entries from the former into the latter.

/etc/ppp/options had "usepeerdns" in it.

That will basically auto-update resolv.conf with the appropriate values 
of dns received from the dhcp server at touchtel's end.

Some non-free os issue commands to users like this: "hey you, shut down,
restart ..." and the user has to obey as commanded.

Free software gives users the freedom to do what they want with their
system, and they are free to improve an application to suit their need
or requirement.

There is is an ocean of difference between the two, and there is no
point in giving ideas like "hey you, on you knees/keep away ..."  free
software users. Please avoid such posts to this list atleast.

Lengthy forms may use several different data types and  any decent form 
validation script gets bluky, and using  JavaScript for form validation 
is certainly "crappy" as you say.  But the problem is that we have to do 
a lot of dirty work writing "sticky forms", if validation fails on the 
server script.  A partial post and get could avoid crappy code at both ends.

look, this is complete nonsense.

he made a fairly valid point about how having to rely on a mouse with 
emacs was not going to be productive, given that emacs is basically a 
CLI based editor, relying on keypress combinations.

don't turn this into yet another pointless thread on non free software

in fact, please don't waste time turning technical discussions into 
advocacy threads

If the form is lengthy, redesign it so it is split across two or three 
screens of data, so you can retrieve and cache the form information 
without having to rely on client side scripting or support for partial 
POST / GET requests.

"The How to on connecting ADSL modem provided by touchtel in Linux ?" will be made available in 2-3 days.
 
 
 
Those who wish to get or already having Touchtel ADSL modem under the home plans ,ask your engineer to give TERA-100U manufatured by Tera Inc.[you can find this by seeing the backside of the modem,remove the sticker marked as "bought by Touchtel .......or something of the sort";There you can see the manufacturer details-In my case TERA-100U, Tera Inc.]
 
See the compatibility[support] for your modem in the eciadsl page.

I want to know whether it must be generic or simply for my modem[TERA-100U ADSLmodem].???ie., whether i should specify what all links and helps i received  regarding ADSL modems or should be specific about Touchtel ADSL modems???please reply...

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] http compression
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0410182325440.24766@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,

I have come across a topic called http compression.
It says that any of the web content can be compressed
by the webserver or application server and sent over
network. And according to the http 1.1 standard most
of the browsers will understand the compressed format
and on the fly uncompress and present to the user(without
user's intervention).

This will make the rendering of the html fast and reduce
the time spent for transportation on network.

I heard that apache supports that with additional module
(mod_gzip).

I have Netscape Enterprise Server 4.1.(web server and
not Application Server). I think, this does not support
compression on the fly.

Is there any way by which I can implement the same for
my large html files in my application. If I just add
the header ('Content-Encoding', 'gzip' ), I think it will
not work and I need to add some logic or through API(Servlets
and core java) I shoudl achieve this compression. Am I correct?

Google helped me little. But if somebody can point
me to a more relevant web link or give some suggestions,
that would be great.

Thanks and regards,
carti

One little known factoid seems to be that he's worked a *lot* on text editors
in his youth. What's so fascinating about editors that it attracts the
best hackers (RMS/EMacs, ...)? All the folks who're fighting about CLI/GUI
Emacs, etc. would do well to read this article.

Anyway, the section on filesystems/databases, some of the CS work at

Message-ID: <4174A518.9040701@tandbintl.com>

Dear Friends,

At last, I am able to connect to Touchtel DSL line through Conexant 
modem. Browsing speed is also very good. I have used Olitec driver. It 
seems to be very small driver than any other ADSL modem driver and also 
it follows the Windows driver architecture it seems to be. Let me 
prepare a HOW-TO for this after a few days of doing some clean up work 
and get exactly what we need to do to make this kind of modem/driver up.

Thanks a lot to ILUGC for the wonderful support and encouragement!

Hi Great job, ignacius!

You have achieved it in short span of time. Keep it up.

1. Btw you prepare a HOW-TO for this specific modem. Distinguish the 
modem specific configurations and Touchtel specific configurations. This 
I found missing in many of the documents. Please do it.
2. Touchtel has provided me Conexant chipset modem, not the one you 
have. For this modem NO SUPPOT except OLITEC. That too I got very very 
less support while googling also. So better prepare a HOW-TO specific to 
your modem with respect to Touchtel connection. Since I have also 
successfully configured and connected to internet via my Conexant modem 
with Olitec driver, let me prepare a HOW-TO for this modem. Both these 
modem drivers are entirely different. So it would be useful to all.

Hello all,
           I am working as Information Security Consultant. I am using RedHat for the past 3 years and quite happy with RedHat. I tried Debian W00dy, since I messed with X confing, I don't want to waste my time in that. My kind of working will be on developing security tools, shellcoding, IRC roaming, etc.. Lotsa new stuff happened in Linux community like new kernel 2.6.x, new KDE, new GNOME, etc.. I feel I want to try the new stuffs!. SO, now I fell it's right time to shift from RedHat 9 to something else which would suite my work and my intrest. I tried Fedora 2, Knoppix, Gentoo, W00dy. Not happy with ny one like RH 9. I have a option of SuSE 9 and RedHat Enterprise Linux, but no idea about it. I wud like to recieve as many as mails in regard with this, which will help me in choosing my next and appropriate Linux Distro.

  Using multiple form tags in the html will solve the partial submit
issue. When you submit any one of the forms, only the data elements
that is declared in that particular form will be submitted; all the
other form data will be discarded as the control moves to the next
page.

 If server side GET or POST to a different server is what you are
looking for then it can be achieved by using CURL lib in PHP

Emacs might have started out as a CLI based editor because pointing
devices were not common then, but now, the mouse is well supported for
editing.  In the "Frames and X Windows" section of the Emacs manual, the
use of the mouse is elaborately dealt with.  There is also a chapter on
"mouse-avoidance" for those who think of it as a nuisance. There are
other pages on creating buttons and widgets that make sense within
Emacs. Therefore, the casual comment "If you're using the mouse, you're
better off using something else" is misleading and incorrect.

We can think of features like autocompletion in form text boxes, if
JavaScript client can post/get values from the server without submitting
the entire form.

Sivasankar, thanks for the link to the interesting, frank and open
interview of Rob Pike.  Pointer like this truly guide and help :)

BTW, regardless of the os we use, reading the "The Unix Programming
Environment" [Rs. 125/- !] by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike would be
rewarding. It includes a good introduction to ed at the end.  It seems
sed was written "one afternoon" by modifying ed!  Such superb technical
writings with grace and style are very rare these days, and maybe even
no longer appreciated.  The parable of "The Unix and the Echo" by Doug
McIllroy is reproduced in the book, bringing out the deep connection
between philosophy, specification and implementation :)

Regards,
Ramanraj.

Why "write a new Gmail" ?

Autocompletion could be done quick binary search of relevant sorted lists.

Anyway, the features of Nevow sound too familiar as my "head" has had
for long an implementation that uses PHP and a database backend.  So, my
"head" aches to use something else, though it does seem to understand
what Nevow is all about :)

It's not `understanding *about* Nevow` that I was talking about, but
learning Twisted, Nevow is something that is not as easy as with other
API/Frameworks.

emacs supports the mouse is something on an equivalent scale to "emacs 
has cute, sharp and clear fonts" etc.

all these are bolt-ons for what is basically a CLI tool, so that you'd 
have to do more than the normal amount of work with a mouse for what a 
single M-[x][y] or C-[x][y] keypress would do for you.

We're starting a war where Pike has deliberately tried to avoid one. If you
read his article, he says that Emacs didn't have mouse support at *that*
time - and in his paper, he even admits that everything in Acme might be
possible with Emacs. 

But I was thinking on reading his article - what sucks with the code editors
of today? What would you replace/change? Do send in your thoughts

Dear Friends,

I am using Windows for last 6 years and Linux for last 6 months. I able 
to find good improvement of windows kernel stability over the period of 
Windows NT to Windows XP. But we know that everyone claims that Linux 
kernel is more superior than Windows kernel. I am reading document on

Can anybody give me technical explanation *(i.e kernel designwise)* on 
why the Linux kernel is more stable, secured and flexible than Winows

 ?

  It is not that it is superior OR inferior, in windows kernel we don't know what is happening inside and there is no previlege for us to customize the kernel of windows for resource conservation.Where as in Linux kernel we have a previlege to know internals of kernel so that we can remove the things in kernel which we don't require(may be blocking thing which which are security holes) I mean to say we can customize the kernel to our requirement.

You are keeping yourself busy with only useless work so that you can

Now I guess it is the next new position in Microsoft .. being filled
with student Ambassadors who will be paid for their futile attemps for

Both are monolithic in terms of design.

IMO The Windows kernel is very much tied to its GUI that you can't
separate both of them.  This is not the case with Linux or even for any
Unix kernel.

Also, Linux is free software which might mean it contains fewer bugs
(Given enough eye balls, all bugs are shallow).

A mouse has its own limitations and does not get any better in other
applications. Even in native GUI applications, key stroke equivalents
for the mouse are mostly available, and users can customise and use
whatever suits them most.  Therefore, let us please keep the poor mouse
out of this issue.

To put things in the right perspective, let us get back to the original
issue. It is plain that Emacs, as of now, does not support listboxes,
combo boxes, toggle buttons, and other GUI widgets, except a few.
Newbies could save a lot of time by not searching for them. May be if
those who really feel the need for it, work on this, we may end up with
a good looking GUI for Emacs.  That could make Emacs a good GUI + CLI
tool, and life a little easier for me too :)

Have you tried to configure emacs using the menu options?  Emacs does 
support combo boxes and a few other things there.

What emacs does need is a thorough going over from a UI and GUI usablity 
point of view, before all this is hacked into it.

Till then - it functions just great as a cli tool.

It is "text" based, and may not work on the menu bar, where we want to
see it.  I have not tried this, and may be wrong.  But, recent versions
of TeXmacs are based on emacs and have a decent gui.  Maybe, if enough
people do get interested, we may have a similar or better looking gui
for Emacs.

Sure.  Righ now, emacs enforces productivity of the mind through its
CLI, and probably many are too happy with that :)

One major tech up is the Unix like file permissions and ownership
which can be so easily modified and changed. Then there is the vast
amount of tools available all of them again open source and hence
again more secure.

Basically the one point that adds secority to any app is it being open
source. Open source apps can always be tweaked up and looked around.

Some how, I too use only vi to edit any conf file, by sheer habit.

Writing code is easier with emacs, but getting started with emacs was a 
nightmare for me, and I certainly wish that more widgets can find they 
way to the menu and tool bar sections, atleast for the sake of people 
who are used to gui widgets.

I also wish I can reach that level soon !

And the result you get is? And you're missing Windows 2003. A fair
comparison is the latest that Windows has to offer with the latest Linux has
to offer. So this would be a Win 2k3 system all patched up and a Linux 2.6
system

Actually, the original poster had specifically asked for a technical
comparison. For a  lot of info on how the Windows kernel work, you might
want to read the book 'Inside Windows 2000'. Though you don't have source
code, there is a vast amount of technical information available online. If
anyone has any doubts on a *technical* aspect of the GUI, I can try and
chase down the details (though I'm not really a Windows kernel guy like
people like Matt Pietrek)

OK guys - instead of this kind of sniping .. let's tell you what.

We'll set up two systems, at IIT-M.  Both specced exactly the same. One 
with Win2K3, the other with (say) RHEL, or debian with a 2.6 kernel.

We'll torture test both of them, check uptime, benchmark a whole lot of 
things.

Should make an interesting project.  Anybody up for it?

Good idea.Though I'm not a hardcore sysadmin, I can find someone for you to
run the Windows side of things. One thing though - it should be a fair test
in terms of updates, hardware,etc,etc.

Should be fun :-)

A quick reading seems to indicate a close contest with Windows winning some

:)  If you have a linux list, having at least one windows / bsd / 
solaris etc fan around does make for some useful data points at times

This discussion is about "the linux kernel is superior to the windows 
kernel" .. given that in windows the kernel and OS are so tightly 
integrated, let's just make it a head to head comparison of linux with 
windows - comparable versions, on comparable hardware.

So once we get to scientific observation rather than advocacy, the 
discussion can get more friendly / civilized than it has been so far

Ever heard of ACLs? Windows has a more granular system of permissions. As
for security, could you give any specific unpatched example rather than
making a sweeping generalization?

Amen to that. 

So let's hear it from you guys on questions you'd like answered about
Windows. Where do you think the Linux kernel is technically superior to
Windows?  The filesystem? And no - 'M$ sucks!' is not a valid response :-)

You really havent read the mail from Sridhar that started this thread have
you? Plus - if someone asks a question about Windows in this group, why
shouldn't I answer it? I believe I can give a contrasting viewpoint - and
probably we can all learn something in the process. Is that so bad?

Hi!

My thoughts below:

There is no doubt Linux is far superior than windoze
in terms of stability, security and performance. 

I would encourage you to read:

[1] Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin & Greg
Gagne. (2003). Operating System Concepts. (6th ed.).
John Wiley & Sons.

If you would like to understand the Linux kernel
internals, then you can look into:

[2] Daniel P. Bovet & Marco Cesati. (January 2004).
Understanding the Linux Kernel. (2nd ed.). O'Reilly.

Linux has an excellent memory management system.
windoze hogs the hardware unnecessarily.

Hi all,

I work for a software company in Chennai. I use 2/3 versions Windows,
2/3 versions of Solaris at office and Linux (RHEL) at home.

I've been with chennai lug for about a week now and all I see is a
bunch of flame wars about  how linux is the greatest or windows sucks
etc... there is no end to such issues, unless we get it out of our
mindset, that because we like a particular OS, we should defend it.

I like Suresh Ramasubramanian idea that there should be scietific
evidence and not just a bunch of opinions that determine the laurels
of an give software system.

Further, we shouldn't be looking at the raw kernel power etc.. what is
critical is which OS is best suited to a user, given his requirement.

There is no point in comparing something like Linux and Windows coz,
the linux kernel you guys are talking about is not out there to make
money, but the windows is ... If all the software that you will ever
use is to be free, where do you think that software dev, designer,
PMs, PL, CEOs etc. get their salaries from.. remember also that a
majority of Linux distros that are easily usables by most users are
paid versions. Btw, any of you use RHEL/ Suse etc, without the
licensing is required, then you are still violating exactly the same
rights that any guy using an illegal version of windows is .

And no, I do not say that Windows is the greatest or Linux .. there
are for different markets.. maybe as a home user, getting familiar
with Linux is a good bet, since you can get your self liberated from
copyright issues, but then think of a user, say a music composer. He
wants to setup a small home studio where he can do some recording and
arrangements.. there is no way on earth that he can think of something
like linux.. yeah , he can go for a mac, but he can setup something
that delivers the same performance with windows for half that cost. So
both OSes have their place and we shoudl respect that

Fair enough. I'd just point out that what's being compared are two 
reasonably comparable server installs of windows and linux, running 
standard / bundled servers [mail / web / proxy shall we say].

In fact, to make it even more equal, install sendmail's win32 version on 
  windows, and compare it to sendmail on linux.  Ditto with apache (also 
available on both platforms).

That way we can reasonably even out any kind of perceived difference in 
the two specs we start off with.

Do I see volunteers for this?

I did specify two good resources in my e-mail post: 

[1] Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin & Greg
Gagne. (2003). Operating System Concepts. (6th ed.).
John Wiley & Sons.

[2] Daniel P. Bovet & Marco Cesati. (January 2004).

I guess you read between the lines :)

I have read both books (maybe older editions, though), and IIRC, [2] does
not provide an comparision/benchmarking of Windows version Linux. [1] has a
chapter on Windows NT and on several other OSs, and I don't remember if
there was a comparison/benchmarking again. Could you please point me to the
page numbers?

Linux 2.6 kernel officially supports SELinux (FLASK security model) as a
part of the kernel. This model is much superior when compared to MAC and
ACL security framework used on Windows operating systems. It provides a
more granular set of permissions and access control ruleset. And yes, it
is more powerful in handling untrusted applications by the use of
sandbox/jail like framework. 

Of course, NSA has funded/incubated this project, which means it should
be possible to deploy military grade security framework using
SELinux (better than TrustedSolaris, TrustedBSD and so on). If thats not
enough... there are many more alternatives (Linux Capability Set,
GRSecurity, Immunix-LSM, RSBAC and so on) to sort out the issue of
default UNIX DAC security model.

Talking broadly from the security perspective, I haven't come across
much options for securing the Windows platforms especially from
untrusted applications. There is no option on Windows platform infact,
to replace the default MAC security model with DBAC, RSBAC, FLASK or
anything better.

Hmm..a better idea would be to compare Apache and Sendmail with their
Microsoft counterparts. For these were applications tuned more for the
Unices rather than for Windows. Let's compare a true-blood Microsoft system
with a Linux system. What say?

And also - I want people's thoughts on fair benchmarks for stuff like
productivity,usability,etc - as kernel is not the OS(as someone else pointed
out)

One last thing: It is better that there are no code writing jobs for
humans at all! Code is for machines, and it is only fair they be asked
to take care of the code they need to work as well.  Ofcourse, until we
ask the right way, they may refuse to write their own code, but after
that, we should have all the time for leisure, study, bird watching,
relishing good food (including apples, peaches, and mangoes straight
from tree branches that may be around), abundant fresh water, making
friends, space exploration, etc. etc and enjoy life to the fullest
extent possible :)  I'll certainly stop here :)

The first requirement for scientific analysis of software would be
availability of the source code for study. The various teams should
submit the source code to the judges and compile the kernel at the
venue.  This is necessary to rule out manipulation of any benchmarks or
results by secret tricks, cheating or other arrangements ;)

A very nice and balanced mail - and you're totally right. What we're trying
to do here is to satisfy our geek curiosity - I doubt whether our little

OTOH, IIS, etc ... are all implemented with kernel level hoping for
some performance.  This is more unfair than what you've seen before. 
So comparing with windows version of Apache, Sendmail .. is better.

Wait a minute - Microsoft anticipated what benchmarks you are going to run
and unfairly tweaked their OS *before* releasing their OS?Gee..I didn't know
that Microsoft employees were clairvoyant.

Hmm..not really. We're talking about real world scenarios here - and I don't
know too many people running Sendmail and Apache on their Win2k3 production
systems (someone got any Netcraft pointers to back me up on this?).

Plus the idea here is to compare the Microsoft suite of products with the
OSS suite - so we need a better way.

hello!!!
I thought we were looking at kernel benchmarking.
I do not beleive that you can test a kernel for its whatever
performace by running normal applications on top of it. Maybe those
who wrote those applications were primarily developing for one
environment and they designed to suit that env better!

We should be look at comparing stuff like, memory allocation, page
management, IO, etc. and measure them across various types of such
activity, like bursts of increase in required memory, steady inc in
memory requirement etc..

I don't care which kernel you are testing.  If you want to call this a 
scientific test, then do and act as the scientists do.  Any experiment 
should be ideally reproducible by others for further study and 
observation.  If that is not possible, atleast please don't use the word 
"scientific" in your tamasha here.

Early versions of Apache didn't make use of the threads support in WinNT. I
mean to say - an application which is meant to run on Unix wont make use of
the all the features of Windows - or make best use of them. If you're
designing for Unix, your design would be fundamentally different from your
design for a Windows app

Oh well. In the same way using IIS,.. in Windows side would also be
unfair as Microsoft is used to push it's applications inside the
kernel, while the basic UNIX concept is abstraction and levels.

hi all, 

there is going a serious discussion on superiority.

for all developers i want to ask u that how u examine the performance
of the OS kernel???

some say linux kernel is best and some say windows is best. in what way??
we should not tell with the benchmarks relesed by the software vendors.

we should use and see which fits our requirements. 

i am using FC2. its quite good for me to learn linux. i like that. i
also like windows XP. although lower versions of windows are not that
much good.

as we are software developers should always give way to good new and
innovative technologies. i.e whether it is a proprietory software or
Open source...

All open source projects are not succeeded. some only succeeds which
solves the real world problems. All Proprietory softwares are not
sold. only those which which suites the requirement are sold.

for an average user, they pay and get windows as they think it is
suited for them. for developers we need some tools, thats why we go
for linux OS. Today linux exists, but if some othere technology comes
tommorrow which solves the real world problem better than linux, then
linux will be overridden.

when i ask my friend , why not using linux for u pc, he said, its
difficult to handle. since he is addicted to windows environment. i
also showed him good linux OS like knoppix, suse, fc2, redhat,
mandrake. but he said he cant use that. People doesnt want to learn.
they just need a OS which does all thing they want. only we developers
need that.

conclusion
i can say that not to compare anything. in some wat windows are best.
in some way linux is good. we should use these technology and finish
our job faster than before. there are some software vendors who want
to show their intelligence in the OS market by showing the benchmarks
so that they can downgrade the leading OS vendor.like sun microsystems
fighting agings redhat.

which evertechnology suits our requirement, we must accept it.

Enough has been said about linux in this thread already, so I'll risk taking
the NT side of things ;-)


 From a pure architectural perspective, the Windows NT kernel is remarkable.
It's a hybrid microkernel that targets the stability and flexibility of a pure
microkernel system while retaining the performance of a monolithic kernel.

The NT kernel consists of two parts - the core kernel and various "subsystems"
that depend on the core kernel.  Subsystems run in kernel mode and perform a
variety of tasks - virtual memory management, cache manager, the user mode
API libraries[1], etc.  The kernel is very flexible can be "extended" in
amazing ways by creating new subsystems.

In recent years, the kernel has given in to "feature creep" and the number of
subsystems has steadily increased in quantiy and complexity[2].  Since buggy
subsystems have the potential to crash the entire system, NT is becoming
more and more unstable.

Another instability problem occurs due to buggy drivers.  NT drivers run
partly inside the core kernel and partly as subsystems in the Executive layer.
Buggy drivers can easily lock up NT.  I used to run WinNT4.0 for ~18 months
and never had a single crash - it's pretty stable if you install good drivers
for your hw.


Linus has done an excellent job in keeping unnecessary stuff out.  The khttpd
and Tux projects have embedded a http server into the kernel.  But thankfully,
they have not been adopted widely as Linux grew the sendfile syscall to allow
even user mode http/ftp/etc servers to accomplish the same thing.

I guess Linux's "superiority" arises from good design decisions.



[1] NT supports win32, POSIX and OS/2 subsystems natively.  Dos/Win9x
    emulation is also done the same way.  Ofcourse, POSIX and OS/2 apis are
    poorly implemented to favour win32.  In the initial release, POSIX
    subsystem did not even support networking.  MS sure knows how to kill the
    competition!

[2] NT 4.0 and above runs the GUI subsystem in kernel mode.  This caused Dave
    Cutler the NT tech lead to quit MS.  With Longhorn, MS definitely move its
    latest database like FS into the kernel... an in-kernel RDBMS engine!

Are you sure about this? Everything seems to indicate that he's still
working for Microsoft on the 64-bit edition of XP. In fact, he's still
listed as a distinguished engineer on the Microsoft site.

I don't think MS would want to do this as WinFS is already getting delayed.
WinFS is based on a SQL Server backend - and to my knowledge, moving SQL
Server into kernel space may not be such an easy task

Message-ID: <20041021005504.4EC151DB284@www.ae.iitm.ac.in>

Earlier in this thread, there was a discussion about ACLs and Windows vs
Linux security models by Chandrashekar. I mailed a MS employee and here's
the response I got

Sriram,

  First off, while it's wonderful that there's an experimental derivative of
Linux that is adding mandatory access checks, none of the mainline
distributions actually implement this functionality.  There are lots of
experiments going on out there, but until the results of those experiments
reach a mainline branch, it's not particularly relevant to the real world.
As far as I know, the mainline Linux 2.6 branch doesn't include all of the
SELinux hooks, just some of them.   And none of them are enabled on any of
the mainline distributions.

 

  In addition, the acid test of an authorization system occurs when the
filesystems and other components are rev'ed to add this support.  Just
because the kernel has support for a feature doesn't mean that end-users get
to see the benefit of that feature.  How many existing applications will
have to be redesigned when the authorization mechanism changes from WGO to
the SELinux role based access check mechanism?

 

Windows ACL model is built into every single Windows NT system, and thus
every application gets to take advantage of it.  Windows supports an
extraordinarily diverse set of security mechanisms.  For example, if you
want to implement a *nix style WGO access check mechanism, you can (check
out this for some details on how to do it).  Windows NT supports pluggable
authentication models.  Natively, Windows supports at least two different
network authentication systems (Kerberos and NTLM), with widely different
authentication semantics.  There are third party vendors who have
implemented their own authentication mechanism, and they've been doing it
since 1994.

 

All of these capabilities have been in Windows NT since 1993 when it was
first released.

 

Since Windows 2000, Windows has supported two-part authorization (smart
cards and biometrics), which added a third native authentication system.
This functionality was dropped into the system without changing the
documented security semantics.  That's the beauty of a system where the
security infrastructure was well designed, well isolated, and built in from
day one.

 

 

Btw, In the interest of fairness, if you implement the WGO stuff I described
in the ACL conversion post, then there ARE some things that will be broken.
In particular, the CACLS tool and the built in NT ACL UI don't handle
Exchange Canonical ACLs very well.  But if the application treats the ACLs
on objects as opaque blobs, they work perfectly, without modification.

There are tiny httpd daemons that run embedded into the kernel. Compare 
iis against one of them, integrated with apache then - for example, 
khttpd at http://www.fenrus.demon.nl/

Anyway we'd have to keep these in mind for w2k03 - 
http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/05/05/win2003.html .. some 
rather interesting features that linux / *bsd can certainly match.

We are talking about benchmarking performance, not doing code audits.

Machines do (sort of) write their own code.  Look at IDEs that translate 
click / drag / drop actions into basic code frameworks that you can 
build on .. and look at things like autoconf / automake etc that 
automate an otherwise tedious config + build process.

You still need humans. Or you need perfect AI of some sort, for code to 
take shape all by itself, generating itself from previously available 
code, and writing itself to suit the entire spec / requirements handed 
to it.

  Thanks for the informative post. I'll add some historical perspective
to show how MS (and everybody else who dabbled in Microkernels in the
early 90s) were led astray by the same fallacy.

  The common idea behind all microkernels was to have a simple, throughly
tested and correct microkernel with minimal extraneous code, running at
the highest privilege level; and all additional stuff (including traditional
kernel functionality like I/O, drivers, paging, scheduler policies, etc.)
at a lower privilege outside the microkernel, sometimes as simple user-mode
processes. The various implementations differed in details - some used
system calls to interface to the microkernel, while others like Mach (the
grand-daddy of all microkernels) used message-passing.

  All three microkernels in use today (Windows NT, Mac OS X and Hurd) have
a strong Mach heritage. Windows NT through Rick Rashid & Dave Cutler, OS X
through Avi Tevanian (CMU, NeXT), Jim Magee (IBM Microkernel), etc., and Hurd
directly through Mach (Utah & CMU).

  All three made the same mistake: They assumed that by moving complexity
to user-mode (or a lower privilege level), it would be easier to manage,
debug and maintain. Nothing could be further from the truth! Spaghetti is
spaghetti, whether it's in-kernel or out-of-kernel. A problem in a device
driver or a root name server can bring the entire system down - it's
immaterial if the kernel is still running, if the rest of the system is
down. In reality, a microkernel only succeeded in creating multiple
points of failure, with Metcalfe's law making it much more difficult to
pinpoint the exact sequence that caused the failure - debugging became
harder, not easier!

  Anyway, this realization caused IBM to halt its own microkernel project
(also based on Mach) in the mid-90s, and the only other Unix-related
microkernel project, OSF/1, also remained a showpiece with little use.
The Hurd developers ran into this same issue much later, as did Apple
and MS. MS attempted to solve the problem by moving stuff back into the
microkernel, which then ceased to remain a microkernel. Apple, OTOH, has
done an outstanding job in releasing a stable microkernel - but then again,
it had a great development team who had previously worked on two different
Mach-related projects, NeXTStep and Workplace, so they knew what worked
and what to avoid. They also had full control over their hardware platform,
so additional low-level drivers are minimal (mostly video cards, etc.).

  MS does not have this luxury, so it's no surprise that NT driver stability
is the issue that takes down NT frequently.

  All of this is generally moot, since the Linux kernel has achieved *both*
excellent driver availability and stability (in addition to all its other
features), so there's no longer any need to consider any other alternative,
except perhaps the *BSDs, which still rock.

  FUD. SELinux has been available in userland since FC1, and all you need
to do is to modify the policy framework to integrate aditional apps - there
is minimal additional dependancy for most apps.

AFAIK, the kernel SELinux support is a complete merge from the NSA codebase.

  It's better to migrate the apps methodically to an SELinux policy-based
mechanism, rather than change everything overnight, as Longhorn is attempting
to do. Over time, the Linux model will work better, as it offers a larger
ensemble of choices, including whether to use SELinux or not.

  ACLs, PAM, Kerberos, etc. are all derived from OSS- and Unix implementations,
and have been standard on GNU/Linux for an eternity. Don't even get me
started on how MS tried to break Kerberos compatibility by their usual
embrace-and-extend strategy.

  You're joking, right? You actually consider smart-cards and biometrics
as *major* architectural implementations? These mechanisms were always there
in Linux (or any *ix or *BSD) using the PAM framework, and all it takes
is a single PAM object for each mechanism. BTW, PAM came from Sun Microsystems
and MS has nothing to do with it.

  OK, try doing this - use a single PAM object to setup and detach an
encrypted filesystem, on any kind of block device, on just about any
kernel version dating from 2001 to today, using just about any well-known
encryption algorithm (DES, 3DES, MARS, Blowfish, Twofish, AES, ...),
and still remain on-disk compatible across all the kernel levels. (This is
possible today using cryptoloop on the Linux kernel - I just migrated
to Linux-2.6.8.1 with no changes to my encrypted filesystems or my userland
PAM framework).

It is not advisable to install rpms compiled from one

As far as SuSE 9.1 is concerned, you need to install
gcc. Please check this thread:

  I'm a little surprised that gcc from RedHat installed
cleanly on Suse 9.1 without any dependancies. Did you
install it from rpm or recompile it from srpm?

Yes, Having a person like Sriram does really help us think out of the box. All the linux user have similar perspective and tend to accept anything said in praise of Linux. Nothing is fully perfect, and yes Win has, atleast, some features thats upperhand compared to Linux. I myself is a linux enthu, but i do have to work in Win most of the times.

Subject: [Ilugc] Summay of Linux kernel vs Windows kernel!
Message-ID: <417737A9.3080403@tandbintl.com>

Dear Friends,

Thanks for your overwhelming response/discussion based on thread I 
started. Really it is a amazing that people are learning more and more 
keep them updated. I want to mention some points here to summarize the 
flow of this thread! Since I am not a system programmer, whatever I have 
understood I am summarizing here.

1. Actually I asked about kernel design level comparison, but the thread 
flew in different direction mostly. So I have decided to take up this as 
assignment soon and make a simple document comparing the kernel features 
(definitely I willl have tough time.. of course enjoyable too.. to read 
good books). Based on that we can start a thread, I think that would be 
more scientifc approach than some emotional talks.

2. I thank Mr. Sivanand VelMurugan for his explanation:

>but then think of a user, say a music composer. He

You are 100% right!

3. I thank Mr. Raja Subramaniam for the following valuable inputs. I 
agree with this, I too experienced many times.

Thanks to all for this wonderful thread! Let us have more scientific 
discussion!

The performance of `search', `sort' algorithms, etc. depends more on the
programmer and the compiler rather than the OS. These algorithms are CPU
(and somewhat) memory intensive. We should test real benchmarks, the
performance of which we care about.

PS: If at all, the benchmarking which we are talking about is going to proceed
	--- why not test the performance (and other parameters) of both Apache
	and IIS on Windows, rather than fight over which one is to be used?

Infact Linux kernel is a modular kernel in nature(technically speaking monolithic), where you have previlege add OR remove anything to the kernel.

  The kernel is not able to make money, but neither is Windows - both are
inanimate. If you mean that those who sell Windows bundled with their
hardware make money, there is nothing that prevents them from doing 
the same with OSS, and in fact a number of companies do so - IBM,
HP, Acer, etc. all bundle Linux distributions with some of their
hardware on request.

  It's free as in free speech, not free as in free lunch. If you mean
that margins will get destroyed by software commoditization, that's
even more true about Windows. Numerous independent producers of
tools, compilers, databases, word processors, spreadsheets, etc. have
been put out of business, along with all the software developers, etc.,
by the integration of applications into the standard windows package.

  If at all anything, the spread of OSS tends to prevent commoditization
of software, since the ability to customize OSS like Sendmail, Apache,
PHP, MySQL, etc. creates huge opportunities at the next meta-layer. 
Witness the birth of hugely profitable businesses like Google, EBay, etc.
that use OSS to create profitable niches in the next layer that cannot be
commoditized easily. 

  If you mean that software developers who develop for the Windows platform
are going to be out of jobs, I'd agree with you. Tough luck - there's no
entitlement to salaries that anybody gets by divine right. People who
made horse-drawn carriages were left without jobs when the automobile
came along. Some, who adapted by making coachwork for saloon cars, still
made a lot of money and survive to this day. Adapt or perish - it's the
survival of the fittest.

  Wrong. You may violate copyright when you make a copy for redistribution,
but you do not violate it when merely *using* binaries derived from GPLed code,
even if the binaries are part of an illegally copied distribution. Read
this carefully, and understand it well. Copyright is all about the right
to copy, not the right to use.

  In any event, there is a version of RHEL3 free from RedHat copyrighted
material - it's called White Box Enterprise Linux. There's no violation
of copyright when this distribution is used.

  You are mistaken - a lot of independent music studios and groups are
in fact using Linux for their digital studio setups. Reason? There are
tools for converting from virtually any format to any other format
imaginable, apart from outstanding driver support.

ha very funny!
That is precisely what I was talking about. 
and btw, none of the companies spend thousands of dollars on
developing linux .. did they?! The community gave it to them and they
released distros out of it... that is precisely why they can afford to
keep it open-source.

I would disagree on this one.. now how many such studio would you know
that could live without stuff like Nuendo or Cakewalf etc.. which are
supported either on windows or on macs ... most of the specialist
cards for audio and video processing, again do not provide drivers for
linux ... and btw, the cost of these card don't give you the luxury of
writing the drivers yourself.. you never ever want to do that!!!

see how many of them pay open source hackers to do nothing except hack

Guys topic got totally deviated, discussion is about techincal diffrence betn Windows kernel and Linux Kenel.And of course linux is free, use linux avoid software piracy.Ans as far as money is concerned Linus torvalds developed linux kernel abosultely free.And with the kind of knowledge and fame he has do U think he won't be earning any money out of it.OR Guys if you freely contribute some patch to opensource and U put in your profile who dares to interview you :-) OR offer U a project .

Strictly speaking winnt kernel should not be called a monolithic kernel.
In the case Linux the kernel is like a singe a.out file, of course you
have the option of adding kernel modules at run time, but that still
boils down to adding a few procedures to this single a.out.
But if you look at the WinNT kernel you have a hardware abstraction
layer implemented in a dll, an Executive that does various management
duties, a Win32 subsystem and many more subsystems that communicate with
each other using a Client/Server mechanism. They have also borrowed from
a layered approach in their design.
This combination of layered and client/server approach is the basic
difference between the linux kernel and the winnt kernel. It was
generally believed that monolithic kernels are better in performance
than micro kernels. The following discussion between Tanenbaum and Linus
would be interesting read, if you have not already read it !
http://www.dina.dk/~abraham/Linus_vs_Tanenbaum.html

Please visit the following link for an overview of the window NT kernel
architecture

Yeah. We had some useful discussions like that in LIG earlier. 
(archives missing :-(). I would always encourage such meaningful
discussions/debates.

But from the postings Sriram Krishnan had in this list, its clear that
his motive is to create FUD in *nix users. That is not healthier.

If Win 2003 was so secure then why did MS change their hosting to
linux when there was a virus threat.

I am not against MS. I use their products. But I cannot agree with 
anybody who say MS OS is better than *nix. Some of there products are 
better  than their counterpart in Free Software world.

More than that the attitude they show towards a user who bought their 
products is really bad. Asking a Win95 user to upgrade to Win98 to
get rid of bugs. Now atleast they have improved, releasing patches
and allow free download.

This is because of the Free Software movement. Now MS too have lot of
documentation online, newsgroups/mailinglists etc. Also released lot
of details to developers who work using MS tools.

The way they tries to monopolize the computing world is another bad
thing from MS. Many technological things they hide from developers
putting them into dilemma.

Finally, There is no point in arguing the technical superiority alone. 
Free software gives us the *freedom*, which people like me give
prime importance. If MS really wish they can come with still better
secure OS. They have money, people et all. They lack the attitude
towards that. Dear Sriram, if you are a MS ambassador, mail/inform
them, what people expect from them than propagating cheap FUDs thru
people like you.

That's a bit inaccurate there, dileep.  MS didnt change their hosting to 
linux

They made their servers available faster around the world using akamai 
(http://www.akamai.net) which just happens to use linux, besides using 
several large and expensive cisco and juniper routers [both closed source]

Yeah, *freedom*  does matter, agree.  BUT, just  because its free(dom)
do you use the HURD for your everyday productive use? Will you use the

Huh? MS always used Akamai for their caching. If you type in
www.microsoft.com, trust me - it hits a Windows 2003 server running IIS. And
Microsoft isn't in the hosting business - that's why they use Akamai. I
think what you're referring to is the worm attack where they removed the
redirection of www.windowsupdate.com to windowsupdate.microsoft.com

Now MS too

MSDN and the microsoft newsgroups have been around for a long,long time,
buddy :-) What is new is the blogging phenomenon and the  feedback system
you find at labs.msdn.microsoft.com (where you can report bugs, vote for
features,etc - and this goes into their bug database)

Very true - there is no hope for this discussion to switch any user from
Windows to Linux or the other way around. But if we don't keep it a
technical discussion, it becomes a plain-old flamewar. Do you really want
that?

You're kidding right? Any statistics or anything else to back you up on
this? Any trends of people posting jobs? And this thread is abt the linux
kernel vs the windows kernel - so if you're going to go OT, atleast back up

Ok - Sridhar - any other suggestion? Suggest a way that we can compare 2

Hmm..Microsoft knows that drivers are a issue and a lot of work is being
done in Longhorn. I'm not a low-level guy so I'm a bit sketchy on the
details - but you can find out more at

+driver+model&hl=en


However, it'll be atleast February before we see a beta of Longhorn

On a totally unrelated note - I'm getting 2 copies of every mail from the
list - even the ones where I'm not on the CC. Any idea as to why this is
happening? I've turned on 'Avoid duplicate copies of messages' too

Let's stick to the point, shall we?  Turning this back into a free v/s

Look here, we are free to benchmark different software using as many
parameters as possible, and stop blaming othesrs for this idea. Such
things are part and parcel of development and growth. There are many
others who who seem to be well informed about Windows kernels, and if
there is a need to do any benchmarking, it could be done without your
Big Boring Diabolic Rants.

Has anyone tried using the Plan 9 Operating System at
http://cm.bell-labs.com ?  Recently, Sivasankar pointed to the Rob Pike
interview at /., that inturn has links to Acme editor which is also done
by Rob Pike.

The Acme text editor manual says: "The most important distinction is
just that EMACS is fundamentally keyboard- based, while Acme is
[fundamentally?] mouse-based."  Acme manual describes itself as a text
based window system, shell & editor. But please don't imagine the bells
and whistles of usual gui applications there.  There are plenty of fresh
new ideas in there, though built upon from good old emacs.

BTW, Plan 9 OS is released under the Lucent Public License as free software.

I sympathize for your ignorance. If you look into the
past archives of our mailing list you will find lot of
ads for Linux kernel engineers, device driver
programmers etc. These guys are paid big and there is
lot of demand even in huge companies like IBM, HP, et.
al.

Linux is used a lot in the Embedded Industry, for
example. Linux for a VLSI company makes more sense
because it is very useful to prove that their hardware
works to specification, rather than spend $$$ for a
closed source OS that you can't rely on. By the way,
embedded systems is one of the hottest industries
today and there is a lot to gain from the market.

Yes, at an affordable cost. RMS was not against
business, he was for ethical business. 

Why would an end user pay USD $300 for an OS like
windoze that crashed often, when you can get reliable
SuSE Linux, with documentation and tech support for
USD $89?

I've had it installed on my machine for a long time. Somehow I found 
myself so pampered with the Linux/*BSD environment that I could not 
embrace Plan 9 as my full time operating environment. There were not 
many applications on it, and its a little hard to get accustomed
with its user interface (a lot of functionality being bound to the mouse 
and cannot be substituted with keyboard shortcuts).

Lack of applications and support for hardware devices makes it 
impractical for day to day usage. Its a good research  OS though, and I 
believe that a lot of operating systems will derive concepts from it.

Working on  Plan 9 environment (Acme, even) reminded me of Dennis 
Ritchie's infamous 'ed' philosophy -  Keep it so simple that only a user 
who "knows" it can use.

Its a nice OS to play with, just for kicks.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Instead of running similar apps, whynot do something like...
* DDOS attacks on both the machines
* Continuous pinging from many hosts
* Copying/creating/deleting a really large file.

I think this way, applications will have little role to play in the benchmarking and will be a real test for the Kernel. Ofcourse somebody has to write some code as pointed by Suraj Kumar.

Linux (or *ix) for VLSI makes sense, because the two major development
suites (Cadence and Synopsis) are for the *ix platform (correct
me if I am wrong). Several companies use Solaris (another closed
source OS). The cost of these tools is of several orders of
magnitude greater than the cost of the operating system.

Only big companies like Intel, IBM can afford to develop their
own tools. Most companies use either Synopsis or Cadence. I have
heard that ARM has only three licenses for a particular tool in
this suite and only three can work on the same tool
simultaneously. I can't confirm that this information is correct.

I read this pdf and it was awesome. It questions some fundamental
assumptions on UI. Now, this set me thinking - if you had to improve the
text editors of today (vi, emacs, notepad, whatever) - what would you do.
What fundamental UI aspects would you change?

I don't understand why you don't like this thread - I've learnt a lot about
kernels (as I am clueless in that area - I code in a totally different
area). And I believe this thread has generally been informative. Yes - a lot
of people don't agree with some of my views but I believe this thread has
been decently on topic and technical (with some amazing posts from
Sivasankar). To put it bluntly - what is your problem?

Duh! Well - go ahead - benchmark them. But I think the other people in the
list want to have a *fair* benchmark - and that's what we're trying to do
here. No one is stopping you from running any benchmarks and posting them on
the list. And I'm not exactly blaming people - you had said in your previous
mail that I should stop talking about benchmarks - and I just pointed out
that it wasn't my suggestion (though I defintely like the idea).

Hmm..I thought I've been pretty short in my mails so far in this thread
(except that one mail which I forwarded on NT ACLs). If anyone else feels I
type too much, please do tell me so and I'll cut down my mails. And with all
due respect, if you have a problem with me personally, take it off the list.

Each emacs functionality module should in addition provide the
corresponding GUI.  And Emacs should by default use Gtk2 UI following
the HIG.

PS: It's very odd to see 'notepad' listed along with emacs, vi, ..  ;-)

Hmm..I actually drifted off more into windowing improvements - and making
better use of the mouse. Imagine being able to 'draw' a window the way you
would select a region in Photoshop rather than resizing.

Also, if anyone has used  Unreal's editor, you would have seen the strange
mouse combos they use (middle button + right button does something,etc,etc).

In my personal opinion don't try to propage the FUD by sending
individual mails.  I was already affected (sriram-ie-fight.pdf).

I think you can discuss this in the emacs-devel mailling list.  That

Move to HK / Japan / the USA or somewhere.  Unless you mean a hundred

Welcome to Chennai!

I had the same requirement last month, and recently had Airtel DSL 
(tocuhtel formerly) connection with telephone. The package tariff is 
like this:
Telephone : Rs 500/ pm (450 free calls)
DSL (unlimited) 64kbps : Rs 600/- pm
Modem rent: Rs 99/- pm
+ tax
Total: Rs 1300/- approx. (almost you need not to pay more than this)

Does anyone know of a *free*, good Python web host? I've been through all
the lists of 'free web hosts' and either found too much downtime or other
issues. Yes - I know there's no such thing as a free lunch but thought
there's no harm in asking :-)

Well - sorry that I took some time in replying to this post. I'll forward
some of your points along (as I'm totally clueless on the inner workings on
the kernel). However, I do have a few observations to make

We can debate for eternity whether this is better or not. What you've raised
is a fundamental difference between the way Windows works and Linux works
(as in the fact that there's only company developing Windows which controls
what goes in and what doesn't). So this isn't really a technical point and
more of a standard OSS vs Microsoft thing - so its better if I avoid it

Hmm..and there's a lot more on Linux's ACL models. However, you've missed
the point. To quote from your original post

>>There is no option on Windows platform infact, to replace the default MAC
security model with DBAC, RSBAC, FLASK or anything better. 

So what he was trying to clear up here is that replacing the authentication
model *is* possible. This mail does *not* attempt to compare or deride the
technical capabilities Linux kernel in any way - but just stresses that
Windows has a way of plugging in authentication models, unlike stated in the
original mail. 

However, I have to admit I screwed up. When I sent the mail to that
Microsoft chap, he didn't realize would be forwarded exactly to a group. I
should have probably snipped out some of the parts which questioned Linux
and didn't deal with authentication in Windows. For that, I apologize - I
should have tried to keep this as technical as possible

Sure, please note that I don't have to time to keep track of every

Dear ILUGC members,

I think that 64 kbps unlimited home plan[ADSL USB modem] which i use  is the best for home users.

   I nearly spent some two days to setup my modem in fedora core 2[at least 5 hours] .And that includes learning the basics of kernel modules,which driver will suite our modem [downloading required files] and compilation and installation.

  You need 700/- for internet[stay connected from 1st day of the month to 31st of the month],the speed will be uniform 64 kbps and you have to pay just 700/-[in addition to your plan amount-Airtel550.400,etc]

Enquire your area Airtel engineer for further details...........

Thank you

ignacius

I just downloaded Ubuntu Linux last week, installed and worked with it 
for a while. If you are fond of Debian+Gnome, then you might like this 
distro a lot. The user interface is polished and more simplified for the 
end users (Gnome 2.8). But it was somewhat slow on my machine (AthlonXP 
1800+, 256MB RAM, KT266 chip motherboard) when compared to Gnome 2.6.1 
on Slackware 10.0.

However, it might appeal to end users. No development tools (gcc 
toolchain) are bundled on the CDROM. The installer resembled Debian very 
much, except that its a lot simplified (lesser number of questions asked!).

By the way, when I boot Ubuntu Linux on a VIA C3 733 MHz/256 MB 
RAM/SiS630E chipset motherboard, it hangs with a blank screen. Anyone 
(by a vague chance) with the same hardware configuration as mine, facing 
this problem ?

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

I am using Warty which is released on 20th. I have the CD with me. It is 
good. It is based on Debian. I was using Debian SID before. Mind you 
Ubuntu is with bleeding edge packages. This is not that stable. Some 
packages seems to be broken so far. But I like Ubuntu over my SID. But 
still I will not purge my SID partition anywhere before December. Have 
to wait and see if Ubuntu makes timely updates.

I would prefer the UI inside the buffer where I one can WYSIWYG edit formatted
text files.  I'd love to edit html, xml, latex, etc in wysiwyg mode.  Emacs
already does some of this, but there is plenty of room for improvement.

I've been dying to hack together an xml editing mode for emacs using which a
user can WYSIWYG edit xml documents.  The styling elements can be provided by
css/xsl-fo.  If any one knows better, please drop me a line.

C3 Erza will not run i686 optimized binaries.  You need vanilla 386 ones or

Hi Sriram,

Which one? gmplayer or kmplayer? Usually, you will
have a VCD option under one of the submenus.

The GUI versions don't implement all the
features/options of the command line version of
mplayer.

	I remember there being long discussions on this list about Windows vs.
Linux, here's a comprehensive report by Nicholas Peterly on the security
front. This was slashdotted too, but I can't find the entry. Pretty
interesting stuff. Lot of firepower for future flame-warriors :). Here's
the original report at The Register:

The first two chapters are online IIRC. That should get you started. 
I would suggest the following two books:

1. Peter Siebel's Practical Common Lisp -
http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/
2. David Lamkins's Successful Lisp -
http://www.psg.com/~dlamkins/sl/cover.html

Just curious: what implementation/dev. environment are you using ?

I have Paul Graham's On Lisp with me as well as SICP - but On Lisp is tough

If its in ntfs format, life might be a bit tougher. Though you can download
the rpm for adding ntfs read support, the last time I looked, ntfs write
support wasn't that good

Dear friends,
Do any of you use CVS for version control in your Office?
In our office we are switching from VSS to CVS...
I configured CVS in Linux server and accessed the Repository,everything works fine...
But CVS doesnt provide Reserved checkouts by default.It can be mad eavailable by using set of cvs commands[cvs checkout,editor,lock,edit-for checkout ; cvs commit,unlock for checkin]..
I got this idea from cvsfe from ccvs.org site....
We use gcvs in linux and wincvs in windows...[currently we are using open ssh for cvs client side access]
Is there any other way for CVS reserved locking to be made more securely...
I posted mails regarding this for the past three days.
But,none of them appeared....
So if any of you have idea about this please reply...
 
Thank you

I am using Subversion. http://subversion.tigris.org/

And it's a lot more better than CVS.  It's the free software revision
control system of the future.  For OSS projects requiring subversion,
see http://berlios.de

There is also a nice book on subversion available for download
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/

Just read upto 3 chapters and I am much productive with svn now.

IIRC, CVSNT has something ("edit -c") that could do what you are asking.

But do you really want reserved checkouts?  CVS' main advantage is that
several developers can work on the same code and CVS can intelligently merge
their changes.  Locking defeats all this.

Also have a look at Windows CVS client - www.tortisecvs.org.  It's usage
simpler than WinCVS and probably supports CVSNT's locking flag.

Pserver on linux with tortise/wincvs on clients is probably the best way to
deploy CVS on a mixed Unix/Win environment.

 You can add the filesystem in your/etc/fstab file

 for step-by-step instructions..Take a look at 
 http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Mount_MS_Windows_partitions_(FAT,NTFS)

 (Note: the default kernel that comes with RH9.0 has FAT32 support
enabled
  so no need to recompile.)

 For NTFS support(use at your own peril)
 you can go here..

Answer the question, if you can.

You always seem to think, what you do is the right thing, and try to impose
your opinions on others.

I guess, this shouldn't be a problem if you use yum for updates.

  Or ensure that you only download source rpms from well-known hosts
and mirrors.

  This trojan was distributed as source (actually obfuscated source),
leading one wag to comment that everything in Linux was more complicated
- unlike Windows, you even have to compile your viruses!

  Which leads to a fairly simple countermeasure - always recommended,
rarely implemented: uninstall the compilers on production servers.

I've used CVS and am comfortable with it. Now I'm hearing good things
about subversion. Would love to hear specific features that subversion
has, that makes it more usable than CVS.

Is subversion stable (does not crash) and reliable (does not corrupt my
source code)?

Sorry about that but he had my permission to test (unlike many other

After many years of development, 1.0 was released (current is 1.1) ..
so I hope it would be as stable as to be used in production
environment.  And don't forget about backups .. there are post-commit
hooks in subversion!

I'm not sure if that buys you much protection... you can always obtain a
binary for the target hardware.  To protect against rogue users, I used to
religiously uninstall compilers on all production boxes.  This was until I
realised how easily binaries for the target hardware can be obtained.
This holds true even for non-x86 platforms running proprietary unices.

  Cross-compiled binaries may be available, but more difficult to sneak
in as a trojan. This attack was disguised as a patch.

  Uninstalling compilers won't stop all attacks, but will stop some attacks.
If you're not going to be building stuff on the production server, it's
probably best to uninstall compilers.

  Chroot/jail-type setups are even better, but it takes more effort to
configure.

Subversion versions not only file contents and file existence, but
also directories, copies, and renames.

That is great., this simply means one does not have to plan the

succeeded. Revision numbers are per-commit, not per-file; log

Means easier to look through logs. Wont get confused with all the

went wrong. This is interesting..

hey, delete the gnome configuration folder in your home directory and
gnome configuration files. then login again. you could see wat u see
before.

if bala is the user /home/bala
then there is a hidden folder called .gnome and .gnome-desktop 
backup and delete and login. it will work for sure.

A few months back, I was facing the same problem with my FC1 
when my system was not shutdown properly. I reinstalled XFree86 
(just a single package) and it worked fine. Anyway examine your 
XFree log before doing so.

If you want a distro similar to Redhat, FC2 should be better. You you didn't

Concerned abt security. try Gentoo/Engarde.

Uninstall all compilers. Download and install RPMS only from trusted
sources(with yum). Is that ok? i am not going to compile anything in the
server, i have separate system for that.

Subject: [Ilugc] Regarding RCS for linux and windows
Message-ID: <20041027110756.80809.qmail@web54102.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear All,

I configured and setup CVS in server[linux] with
clients using ssh and wincvs.Everything works fine.
But,people in our office feel that lock-write-unlock
will be suitable  and told to change to some other
version control software.

I found RCS would suit our needs[locking files
reserved checkouts]

But,there is no detailed tutorial on creating
repository. And also i need OSS frontends for
windows[when I googled most of the frontends for
windows where commercial].Do any of you know free
frontends for RCS...

And also I need good tutorial for setting up
repositories...


Thank you,

ignacius

I am not sure what the "Hyderabad usergroup" means, but anyone who
advocates freedom should not offer a proprietary software developer a
platform to present a practical discussion of a proprietary software
product.

Such discussion focuses on the practical characteristics of the
software, and therefore makes the implicit assertion that, "There is
no ethical issue with this software, therefore the interesting things
about it are its technical capabilities and merits/demerits."  We need
to reject that assumption, and the best way is not to offer them a
platform at all.

I do like to point out that in a not-so-recent interview to one of the
computer magazines in India (forgot which, might have been PCQuest or
something), Microsoft India's some-big-shot mentioned (not in so many
words) that part of their strategy in India is to "infiltrate" the
LUGs and slowly brainwash these LUGs into being MUGs (Microsoft User
Groups - pun intended :) . Let us not be the first or only LUG to fall
into that trap.

Err..Microsoft has a history of attending Linux conferences and Linux group
- I remember that they did a Services for Unix session at Bangalore last
year (and they have similar sessions lined up this year).I'm guessing the
session would be on interoperability or SFU.

Can anyone find out the name of the employee who offered this? Microsoft is
all development at Hyderabad - so this guy might be a dev working for
Microsoft(rather than all the evangelisation and support that comes out of
Bangalore).

I would love to see the actual quote as I seriously doubt any Microsoft
employee would make a statement which can be even remotely construed like
that. He/she would get into some serious hot water.

And in the impossible case it is true(which it isnt-as MS in Bangalore has
other targets) - hey - whoever the MS employee is in this group - why havent
you been mailing and helping me out in all those flamewars? :-)

Look guys, this is an issue that basically concerns the Hyderabad LUG

Could you please take it up on the Hyderabad LUG .. remembering that 
ilughyd policies dont allow license wars, and dont force the use of the 
word GNU (similar to Linux-India-* policy)

Discussions that dont have technical merit (for or against microsoft, or 
for or against gnu) etc will also be stopped quite soon .. at least by 
polite request of the list admins to the posters involved [that includes me]

I reproduce below an email that I sent to Fred, who seems to have 
forwarded the original thread from our list to fsf-friends...

The same request applies to others who feel the same urge to do so ..

  While I respect RMS and his opinions on this matter, I must
disagree with this particular opinion. There's no harm (and in most 
cases, some benefit) from listening to alternative viewpoints, even if
it conflicts with the views held by the majority of the constituency
it is addressed to. There's always something to learn - they should
allow the MS rep to speak at the LUG. Having a closed mind reveals
weakness. Is the GNU philosophy so weak that it's going to lose adherents
as a result of a single presentation from the other camp? I sincerely
hope not.

  At the very least, it's worth knowing what their strategy is wrt
to FLOSS, so as to be able to counter it more effectively (vintage
Arthashastra).

My two cents.  If someone from MS is going to talk about an MS only
product or MS only tools that are not OSS (and have no direct
relevance to the lug), however technical it might be, I think the
answer should be NO.  Same goes for a Mac.  IMHO, that is completely
off-topic for a LUG.  LUGs are not only-tech-groups.  There are
certain philosophies and common sense rules that we do follow.

As regards MS's strategy to 'brainwash' lug members.  Hehe, nice try.
Its dumb plans like these that really get my rolling my eyes over.

The significant thing about OSS is that the bar to entry is very low
and the distribution mechanisms allow me to scratch my itch and let
others use the tools I built in that process to scratch theirs.  Its a
community from the ground up.  Any community that is based on a policy
of unmotivated mutual help and sharing builds an extremely strong and
robust emotional bond.  The instant you bring a company to the party
that does not understand this, the company will be simply ignored like
an outsider in a family affair.

This is simply not a community that revolves around a mega-corp whose
raison d'etre is to make a profit and please its shareholders.  This
is the definition of a successful company and MS is probably one of
the most successful ones around.  So if MUGs are to be as successful
and meaningful to their members as LUGs then MSFT would cease to exist
(atleast in its current form).  Heads I win, tails you lose.

Sorry Prabhu - forgot to hit Reply-to-all :-)

Didn't want to contribute to this thread again but I have some more info now
that I thought I would share with you. I've actually managed to find out who
it is - it is Janakiram who is an Developer Evangelist and also happens to
be a close friend of mine (and is also a major geek/Linux user). For those
of you at Bangalore Linux 2003, you might have seen his session on Services
for Unix (which I heard was standing-room only). I suspect this session is
because he's temporarily at Hyderabad. I heard he's also presenting at
Bangalore Linux 2004 this December - so should be fun. He's a real fun guy.

>The instant you bring a company to the party that does not understand this,

This may be true if the company stays away and is one big dark evil
corporation. But you're forgetting that companies are made up of people and
these people care.They care deeply. Microsoft has guys in Bangalore whose
only job is to help out the communities - but without getting in their way.
You have a problem with a product? They'll put you in touch with the product
team. And these guys love their job. 

I know someone (http://deepakg.blogspot.com) who gets cheered and wild
applause whenever he goes on stage. He cares deeply and he loves Microsoft
as much as you love OSS. And so does the current guy in charge
(http://abhishekkant.blogspot.com) who on an average visits around 5 cities
a week. Forget Microsoft employees. Take someone like me. I care. Am I a MS
employee? No. Am I going to work for them? Nope - I've already been placed
in CTS and will join them when I leave college. But I love the company and
their products. And there are a lot of people like me. Other employees
believe strongly enough to post on their blog about this very
thread!(http://pensieve.thinkingms.com/PermaLink,guid,efbb32ca-7b46-4b7d-96e
b-8ff3ff090372.aspx)

Guys - don't get me wrong. Passion and philosophy is not your domain alone.
I have some strong views on what is right and what is wrong and defend it
the same way you do.And there are a *lot* of people like me. I find it funny
when I'm called a M$ spy or an evil ranter. What would you think if you
defended Linux on my group and someone called you a Redhat spy..or some
other derogatory term?

 So if MUGs are to be as successful and meaningful to 
> their members as LUGs then MSFT would cease to exist (atleast in its

Hmm..forget Microsoft communities for the moment. Communities have existed
around proprietary products for decades -Apple fans are the most hardcore of
the lot. Also, check out Usenet, which is sprawling with
communities.Whenever you have a product that a bunch of people use, you'll
always have the people getting together and sharing tips and helping each
other. 

**The unique thing about OSS is that the people also own the product- and it
is *their* product**. But tell any Mac fan that Apple products suck and
you'll probably wind up with a black eye.

As for Microsoft communities, there are tons of communities around. I run
one for students (www.cnugstudent.net) which has got over 750 members in the
last 8 months. The Bangalore group (http://groups.msn.com/bdotnet) has over
3000 members and the traffic is just overwhelming.Microsoft is getting
involved in these communities only very recently (say last year) - but they
have a hands-off approach. I can do a Mono or a DotGnu session tommorow and
no one will question me or criticize me (and in fact, I've run Linux during
my sessions several times to show off interoperability, Mono,etc.).

And these communities contribute bigtime. Edit-and-continue was implemented
for C# 2.0 at a very late stage for the sole reason that a lot of people
asked for it. Everywhere, you'll find MS employees looking for people using
their products. If you're a programmer, don't you want to talk to the people
who use your code? See how they use it? What problems they face? And fix
those problems? The same thing motivates the Microsoft developers. They're
hackers - just like a lot of you. Yes - in OSS, you could go fix your
problems yourself. But we're talking of a different world here - and saying
that one is better than another would just lead to another philosophy war.

Saying Microsoft sucks is one thing - but underestimate their communities
and you'll be underestimating a *lot* of very smart people who swear and
live by these products.Dont believe me? Check out www.ineta.org or
microsoft.public.* newsgroups.

There are a lot of people who care as much as you guys do.

You guys own your product - you can make any changes you want. I respect and
admire that. But there are a lot of people like me who believe in other
things. Don't deride us.

Forget the (derogatory) terms. This group is meant for discussions about
Linux and things related to Linux. PERIOD.

Why do you think people here have the necessity to estimate how big/smart
the MS communities are? Atleast, I don't feel the need to do so.

I don't care whether the people in the MS groups are hackers, human beings,
whatever. They care as much, but not about what I care about --- So I don't
bother.

Ok.. I'm a devil worshipper. (like your argument) can I ask the Pope to
acknowledge my faith? What matters is principles and philosophy. Free
software is not just about technical superiority. Its about Freedom. The
difference between the people you've quoted above and FLOSS users/hackers is
that the former hardly knows what Freedom is., and the latter values user
Freedom. Not only value., FLOSS users/hackers also respect others Freedom.,
hence they do a ethical business.

Thats the thing. We dont even care what you do in your group/mailing list/*.
How many times does this happen? I really dont know. I'm curious. ;-)

The communities survied not because of the technical superiority/ excellence
of the software/product.. but rather because of the free sharing of
ideas/thoughts. Ideas which otherwise could not be found. Which were usually
hidden secrets (behind proprietary walls).

Nope. they shamelessly sell their code to a corporate who will monopolize
the market and hurt user freedom. FLOSS hackers care a lot for the Freedom
of the users. They let the source out to be assimilated/improved. FLOSS
hackers dont try to find ways of hiding information from the users. FLOSS
hackers promote free sharing of ideas. There are no hidden secrets/tricks.

Hi,

The linux port of CVSNT (http://www.cvsnt.com/)
has support for file level locking, unicode support 
and many other features useful for clients primarily
using windows.

A comparison between CVSNT and CVS is here..

As for the Windows GUI Client..there's always

Dear All,

I configured and setup CVS in server[linux] with
clients using ssh and wincvs.Everything works fine.
But,people in our office feel that lock-write-unlock
will be suitable  and told to change to some other
version control software.

I found RCS would suit our needs[locking files
reserved checkouts]

But,there is no detailed tutorial on creating
repository. And also i need OSS frontends for
windows[when I googled most of the frontends for
windows where commercial].Do any of you know free
frontends for RCS...

And also I need good tutorial for setting up
repositories...


Thank you,
ignacius

I think you did not see what I am trying to say here.  I'll simply
leave it at that.  If you are happy with MS, fine.  I have no problems
with that.  The fact that there will be developers in MS who really
love what they do is all fine and pretty obvious.  Unfortunately, its
completely besides the point.

I certainly did not call you an MS spy or any derogatory term
whatsoever.  If you are referring to someone else's post, please
indicate that.

That is obvious.  The problem is in this case is that the bond between

then anything else.  In OSS that is not the case.

True, and that is a well known fact.  My thoughts were not about what

Please, I understand some of these things.  If you read your own post,
you'll find that you are talking about the people and not the
corporation.  That is precisely my point.  People form communities,
interference from companies can be good and can be bad.  The
difficulty with MS is that their prime directive is to make profit.
Not so the case with the individual developer you are talking about
(they love their work and try to help).  But this is not about
employees of MS but about MS itself.  Sorry to say, their track record
is dubious.

communities.

Once again, stop accusing me of name calling.  If you still don't get
the point, I was questioning MS's motives.  I will always do that
until there is substantial evidence otherwise.  I did not question
yours nor deride MS users.

You also have to realize that this is a LUG, so you are already on the
edge trying to discuss a company like MS.  To be fair to us, you must
acknowledge that we are open enough to tolerate your comments.  To be
fair to you, you have been a decent netizen on this list (except for
the fact that many unfortunate arguments like this one have resulted
due to mutually opposed opinions).  

However, it does beg the question as to why someone who loves MS so
much is even on this list?  Don't you have better things to do with
your time?  And before you accuse me of asking you to leave, for the
record, I am not asking you to leave this list at all.  By all means
stay, but the question remains.  This list does not explicitly discuss
technology all the time.  As with any LUG this is a help list where
folks have their questions answered (and I've been on this list longer
than most).  Most often, newbie questions are answered.  Rarely are
finer technical points discussed at great length.  The rare tech-posts
are thoroughly enjoyed by some of us (so keep up the tech posts
folks!).  For really serious discussions that you must subscribe to
the relevant list in question.

Anyway, I'm out of this thread.  I certainly have a lot of things to
do with my time. :)

cheers,
prabhu

I thought I would respond to this as a lot of people seem to have the same
doubt. To quote from the mail I sent Prabhu 

"I want to learn Linux properly - and also - I want to understand what you
guys think. If I spend all day with MS employees, I would never get the
other side of the story. I want to hear you thoughts - and want someone to
try and convince me. For who knows , I may be totally wrong. I would love
someone to prove me wrong too. I know the dangers of not having an open mind
- and getting into these debates really does test out your convictions. I
want to *understand* why you guys feel the way you do. That's why I'm on
this list. I believe in rational debate and discussion - and so far, this
list has been excellent at keeping things cool."

Hats off to you guys for tolerating me and indulging me in all these
discussions. My geek side has been satisfied too - last week, I really
learnt some cool stuff about the Windows and the Linux kernel. And with
every mail - I learn something new. And I hope my mails(and their replies)
make people think - and understand what they believe in. By all means -
passionately believe and  defend something. But do understand what you're
believing in.

My apologies to Prabhu for not making it clear it was not him doing the
name-calling. I've found his mails thoughtful and rational - and I would
love to have him on *my* side someday ;-)

Thanks,
Sriram

>  
<rant>

  I'll deal with each of these activities separately - they're
entirely different activities, usually performed by different groups
of people, usually called engineers, lawyers and scientists.

  First off, the Indian educational system does not teach *anybody* to
make products, so stop picking on engineers. The main purpose of the
British-Indian educational system (which continues unchanged to date)
was to produce clerical staff with skills to peruse documents, add
numbers and recite regulations from memory. It does this very well,
and that's the main reason there's a huge inflow of BPO work over the
last few years. There are actually very few people in India who have
any aptitude for product engineering at all - so it's probably just
as well that most engineers switch to BPO, web-design, etc. It's
probably a good thing that they aren't let loose to design bridges,
cars, aircraft, etc. (There are, of course, a few very good engineers
who actually build stuff that works - in ISRO, DAE, etc., but it took
decades to build those skills, and it happened in spite of the
educational system, not because of it).

  Secondly, getting patents has nothing to do with making products -
a quick glance at kind of patents issued by most patent offices around
the world (USPTO, etc.) would show that most patents are "defensive
patents" issued to large companies to build a patent portfolio. Why
do you need a patent portfolio? Basically to prevent any future attempt
at extortion from somebody who had nothing at all do with the invention
of the product. Typical examples are patents on the microprocessor,
RAM, etc., which were issued years *after* the invention to people who
were merely opportunistic enough to do the paperwork required to file
the patent. To prevent these opportunistic patents from blocking the
free and unfettered development of real products, most large companies
have huge patent and legal departments, which are usually not connected
to product development at all - in fact, the real engineers at the
companies I've worked were usually very reluctant to even deal with
the patent department. The patent department usually sits in a
different building, often in a different city, and is usually filled
with lawyers, not engineers, and they talk a different dialect of
English which is not well-understood outside of courtrooms, and
sometimes not well-understood even inside courtrooms.

  Thirdly, doing research has even less to do with product development
than filing patents. Again, the large companies I've worked at have a
different group doing research, and it's located away from the product
development teams. The better research groups (Bell Labs, IBM Research,
Xerox PARC, ...) actually have no obligation to develop anything that
remotely resembles a product - their mandate is usually free-wheeling,
'blue-sky' research. If they did not have that mandate, nobody worthwhile
would work there. In the event, each of these places has produced
ground-breaking original work, some of which has later found its way into
products - but that wasn't the intent of the people who came up with
the ideas. Most of the ideas don't ever see the light of day in an actual
product, usually because they just don't work. The people who sit in
research labs usually have math and science qualifications, not engineering
qualifications.

  The Indian educational system would actually do a half-way reasonable
job in grooming people for the second task - namely filing patents - mainly
because it is very similar to the kind of clerical work it was originally
designed to train people for. Not surprisingly, some patent-filing paper
work is actually moving to India as part of the BPO scenario.

  Most research remains firmly in US hands - the best science is performed
in a free-wheeling atmosphere, and only US labs have the resources and the
commitment to making this happen. Most attempts at re-creating this
elsewhere haven't worked well, and the reason is that very few people
actually understand what good science is. Throwing pots of money in an attempt
to do good science is usually futile. Moreover, there's no guarantee that
good science leads to good products - witness the erstwhile Soviet Union,
which by all evidence was outstanding at science, but pitifully poor at
product development. </rant>

  One of the important side-effects of OSS is that first time, the barrier
to entry to developing a useful software product is low enough for almost
anybody with the skills to be able to so. It's actually possible for
a good programmer/software engineer to develop a competitive SW product,
sitting almost anywhere in the world (you still need reasonable connectivity
to be able to do so effectively). Will Indians be able to seize the
opportunity and actually develop good, original OSS? It depends on
several things, not least of which is that there must be an aptitude for
product development, and the means to exercise that aptitude. We're
probably seeing the beginnings of this phenomenon over the last few
years, but there's still a long way to go.

Right on! I wanted to do a project regarding search engines in my college -
basically some research into indexing,etc.. But the problem was no one
wanted to approve it- I was told I should do a 'useful' project. I went back
to them with some cooked up nonsense about how educational search engines
could help students and it got approved instantly. Other people I know have
been forced to abandon research for similar ludicrous reasons

I am not very philosophical about the whole OSS thing.  I mainly use
OSS because it's the practical choice for me. I can't afford to spend
money on Microsoft's development tools, etc. Also, I find the support
system on the OSS side much better than the propreitory side (since I
can't pay for support)

That was just a disclaimer to clue everyone in about why I didn't
pitch in with my thoughts  earlier in this as well as earlier such
threads.

But this (quoted) mail by Sriram was the last straw. I decided to
check if his past record is really consistent with his avowed reason
for subscribing to this list.  I downloaded the ilugc archives from
http://www.aero.iitm.ernet.in/pipermail/ilugc/  and extracted all
mails from Sriram.  There were 53 messages (out of 3095 total) from
him.

I won't comment on them.. instead i'll let you all decide for yourself:

http://www.antrix.net/stuff/sriram.mbox.gz (32K) in standard mbox format

http://www.antrix.net/stuff/sriram.txt.gz  (20K) - only message body;
no headers.

My filtering script might've missed some of his messages. But i guess
these are pretty good indication of the trend.

<jest> Gmail seems to be extremely smart. It's marked almost every
single mail from Sriram as Spam </jest>

Actually, your archive only contains recent mails (and the entirety of the
recent Windows kernel vs Linux kernel thread). For completenes, you might
want to check out
http://www.google.co.in/search?q=site:www.aero.iitm.ernet.in+sriram+krishnan
&hl=en&lr=&start=0&sa=N which shows some other mails which seem to be
missing from the current archive.  However, a search in Outlook shows that
I've sent quite a few other mails which don't turn up in this search.

Dear LUG,

I wrote this small peice of program in my  GNU/Linux Debian sarge
testing i386 with gcc-3.3.

----system.c------

#include <stdio.h>

main()
{

#ifdef gnu
	printf("This system is GNU\n");
#endif	
#ifdef linux
	printf("This system is Linux\n");
#endif

}
---ends here---

and do the following

#make system
#./system
#This system is Linux
#

My question is why dont it give GNU as output?

Please dont blame me if  I am wrong.

Add the line '#define gnu' to the top of the program, then you should get what you want! ;-)

Well, the answer is a macro named 'gnu' is not defined anywhere within the scope of the program.

You would be shocked at the kind of interviewing that happens during campus
placement around engineering colleges. I attended one such *interview* by a
leading Indian IT company. Now, I have to admit that I was a bit
over-confident - I thought I was a sure shot to get in as every other person
being interviewed in my batch didn't know programming and weren't from IT or
CSc. 

Anyway, here's how it went. I walked into an empty class room and handed him
my resume. The guy kept it aside *without even looking* at it. So much for
impressing him with my Python prowess. I walked in expecting the first
question to be something like 'Tell me something about yourself' - but I got
totally kapowed.Here's how the conversation went (please do keep in mind
that this was a IT company hiring programmers) -

Question 1:(Wrote some strange chemical formula) What is that compound?
Me : No idea

Question  2: (drew a weird electrical circuit which I had never seen before)
What circuit is that?
Me : Err...sorry

Question 3:(Wrote some Physics law)That is the law of..blah..blah. Could you
derive it?
Me : I'm sorry - I remember studying this in 12th standard but just don't
remember the derivation now

(similar questioning for 20 minutes.Not *one* computer related question).


Compare this with how the questioning went for someone else who can code as
much as Vemkatesh Prasad can bat(same recruiter)

Recuriter: Hi there - show me your marksheets.

Recruiter: Wow..you got 200/200 in Chemistry in 12th? Tell me about it.

Recruiter: Thanks - you may leave.

Interview lasted for a grand total of 5 minutes and the guy got selected.

Now, I don't have anything against interviewers trying to be fair to all
streams of engineering - but this stikes me as unfair. I'm a coder - ask me
about coding!

Well, normally if one writes a portable code and if he wants to do some 
platforms specific tasks/checks, he would check for the macros "linux" 
or "__linux__" or variants.

> #ifdef gnu
> 	printf("This system is GNU\n");
> #endif	

GNU is not some single entity like Linux kernel. GNU is a collection of 
tools. You simply can't distinguish any single entity as GNU. GNU is a 
collection of tools/libraries on a *NIX variant platform. Maybe in 
GNU/Hurd you can check for "gnu" alone. I don't know.

I don't know what you want to check by looking for "gnu" macro. If glibc 
is what you are looking for, then check for the macro "__GLIBC__" 
instead of "gnu". So, "#ifdef gnu" should be "#ifdef __GLIBC__".

Hi!

You can also define "gnu" at compile time like..

gcc -D gnu system.c

But if you want a built-in macro, you can use __GNUC__

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
	#ifdef __GNUC__
		printf("This system is GNU C \n");
	#endif
	
	#ifdef linux
		printf("This system is Linux\n");
	#endif
}

heh.. this is a rather old piece of joke code - obviously aimed at 
people who keep trying to get others to say "gnu/linux" instead of "linux"

The point is they look for good indepth understanding of any subject 
with good aptitude (not the Debian one ;-)) and problem solving skills. 
For freshers (campus recruits mostly), they donot look out for that 
excellent programming skills. If someone knows the basics of programming 
that is enough for them. In their training, they can always make some 
good problem solver a good programmer too. But the converse is not that 
easy. In my practical experience, I have seen a lot of non geeks (at 
college days) doing great in my industry compared to geeks. A typical 
example for such a sort of company is Infosys. They don't bother for 
your programming skills at all. They strictly believe in problem solving 
skills. Any computer graduate (B.Sc., B.C.A., etc) can write code. An 
engineer or a technograt is not needed for writing the code alone. There 
  are much more things for him to do except them. So, IMO there is 
nothing wrong with the recruitment process from the industry's perspective.

PS: I too was in the same view when I missed some companies in my campus 
interview (Anna university). Once you get into the industry, you will 
change your view too :-)

Still the bad part is asking for academic grades [1] . I had (still
have) a 'U' grade (pending arrear) in a subject and hence missed
plethora of companies including IBM.

But to the benefit of people like me, there are some software
companies which does *ideal* recruiting.

[1] College grades doesn't reflect the
capability/intelligence/creativity/whatever of the students (except
their remembrance skills)

There is one guy in my class who is probably one of the most awesome hackers
I've ever met - but who isnt eligible for interviews on similar grounds.
Total rubbish.

Couldn't have put it better myself. This way, Google saddens me for the
importance they give to which college you're from and your grades. I mean -
I love them for everything else but this

Message-ID: <41653f72041028235312c9936f@mail.gmail.com>

Good day everybody
I am siva prakash, My network contains 15 computers all are Pentium IV
2.4GHz , INTEL origial motherboard,512 MB RAM,15' LG digital monitor,
One machine installed by Redhat Linux 9.0 others are Windows 2000 professional.

I have configured our linux machine (Redhat linux 9.0 server) as a
name server (DNS),SAMBA, sendmail (mailserver) and  squid server
(proxy).

This name server successfully provides name resolutions to my client
machines, and also my client machines can communicate the network
using the SAMBA server.

When I implement the proxy server (squid)
Though I correctly Configured the Modem and successfully connect to
our ISP, I can't Browse the internet (even in the linux server).But I
can successfully ping the ISP's server IP address,but I can't ping the
other website.

In the Network properties "preferred name servers" Filed, I have
entered the same IP address of that machine. Because it resolves the
hostname itself.

But in the Network card properties "preferred name servers" Filed, if
I enter the IP address of the ISP server, I can easily Connect to the
internet and successfully browse it.
But my client machines can't connect to the name/ SAMBA server. So i
can't configure the send mail, (Mail server) because the sendmail use
the name server for name resolution.
So please tell me How can i make my name server as a  Squid server, or
is there any other methods?

PLEASE HELP ME

Add your ISP DNS in to your /etc/resolve.conf and try

nameserver UrServerIP
nameserver IspDnsIP1
nameserver IspDnsIP2

Hi

I am using KDevelop 3.0 on Knoppix 3.6 The Problem is that i am unable
to Debug any program properly. Example:When i write a small C++
Program with 2 functions where one function will accept a string as an
input and the other function will print the string on to the
screen.Now when i set the breakpoint in the function call
(Getstring()) what happens is that the the terminal does not come up
at all and i am not in a position to enter the input for the program
only if i enter theinput for the program the program will continue
execution.Morever i ve installed GDB too . Should i change any
settings with regards to Kdevelop ??

Kindly advice

Thanks in advance

Hi
 
 Nice to have a GPLed indic fonts but the tamil font
 is not very attractive(IMHO). The characters vastly differ
 in height and slant. 
 
 Looks like Redhat bought those fonts
 from "Automatic Control Equipments, Pune"
 (It's mentioned in the copyright attribute of the ttf fonts)

 BTW, Lohit is packaged in ttfonts-indic-1.6-1.src.rpm

There may be other problems too that may be worth taking note.

I had the same problem earlier[1], with Mozilla, when I included a
portion of the "hello" program binary opened with emacs into the body of
the message, to make a point.  The reason might be that some junk [in
the sense, it makes no sense to us] characters may get included in the
body of the message, which some how instruct Mozilla to truncate the
message.  A simple test message, composed afresh, with one or two words,
entered only through the keyboard without cut and paste from
other programs, should help to rule out other errors.  Sangharsha may
also check the "Sent" folder, to confirm if truncated messages were
sent by Mozilla.

BTW, I am curious to know what Lord McCauley [Lord Macaulay?] spoke in
the British Parliament, just before English was introduced as a medium
of instruction in India, that Sangharsha has been trying to let this
list know. Many a legal system, including ours, is built upon the
philosophy of men like Jeremy Bentham and Lord Macaulay. If those
philosophers had had access to the tools we use today, the kind of legal
system we might be using may have been very different.  Very
unfortunately, with the kind of ridicule philosophy receives these days,
it may take eons before any useful reforms or changes become possible.

Before this is ticked off as OT, two bits of info:
Tim O'Reilly wrote [2]:
<quote>
I like to tell people the story of the Mechanical Turk, a 1770 hoax that
pretended to be a mechanical chess playing machine. The secret, of
course, was that a man was hidden inside. The Turk actually played a
small role in the history of computing. When Charles Babbage played
against the Turk in 1820 (and lost), he saw through the hoax, but was
moved to wonder whether a true computing machine would be possible.
</quote>

Then, Charles Babbage sought for funds from the British Parliament, to
build his mechanical computing device, at about the same time as
Macaulay was making his speeches, and this is well documented at
http://fourmilab.ch/babbage  Babbage recieved a little support
initially, but a lot of ridicule later.  His mother alone advised:
   "My dear son, you have advanced far in the accomplishment of a great
object, which is worthy of your ambition. You are capable of completing
it. My advice is--pursue it, even if it should oblige you to live on
bread and cheese."  Babbage never saw a fully working computing device,
but we are fortunate to live during a period when we can take much for
granted. The same issues that troubled Babbage still remain:  Can we 
please have a super computer like Thunder for our country ? AFAIK, that 
question has not even been debated in our Parliament yet. It is time we 
broke the repeating cycles of history to make substantial progress.

  There's more to the story (which you can Google and obtain) - the man
inside was a short-statured, almost dwarf-like man, who also happened
to be one of the strongest Chess players in Europe at the time. I
think his name was Allgaier.

 Also, the Turk had a lot of panels which
would be opened several at a time to show that there was nobody inside,
but yet there were clever compartments that allowed the human inside to
stay out sight by moving from one place to another.

  I don't think there's any really pressing need for a large clustered
machine in India - commodity PCs have become fast enough for most of the
problems that we need to solve (Moore's law took care of this automatically).
Those resources would be better spent on infrastructure - backbone fibre,
core and edge routers, metro ethernet, last-mile connectivity, etc. which
would leverage Metcalfe's law to bring the benefits of connectivity to a
larger proportion of the population (i.e. a large number of roads, US-style,
instead of one rusting power plant in the middle of nowhere, Enron-Dabhol-
Indian-style).

Whether it is needed or not,  the fact that _we_ can debate it this way,
is revolutionary.  "Representative" form of democracy was thought of as
the most suitable for those times, but now Gandhian style of direct
decentralised, community based democracies are workable and possible,
but more on this down below. GNU mailman for public services may make
their functioning easier, to begin with. I do not have hard data that
supports the need for a Super Computer like Thunder, but many at the
india-egov list readily agreed, and it seems there is a pressing need
for smaller clusters with 4-10 nodes.  Every legislative Act has a bunch
of tables that are expected to be kept public and updated, and taking
them to the Internet in meaningful ways, keeping their ends in mind,
could easily use a super computer well.  Data for India's 100 crore
population in conjunction with the many public registers etc. may be one
of the most complex tasks where it could be used well.  Much of the data
may remain in local intranets, and may be queried by others, but for
effective decisions, a central server would be be a must, if the present
org style remains as it is.

More importantly, archiac procedures neet to be streamlined to avoid
GIGO disasters. Without any discussion about the architecture, we have a
lot of talk on implementations.  Now is the time to do serious
rethinking based on philosophy and normative ideals. If we manage to get
that right, every thing else should be fairly easy.

Powers/Functions get split between Central|Federal, State and People,
and the networking between them is generally peer-to-peer.

There are important architectural differences between US and India:

US Style:           Encapsulation of Federal & State Functions.
                      Residue remains with the People
                      [vide IX & X Amendments of the US Const.]

Indian Style:       Mainly Central without strict encapsulation, and any
                      residue remains with the Parliament at the Centre.
                      [vide Art. 248 of the Indian Const.]

Much data under our system naturally gets centralised, and India
therefore needs and has more use for Thunder like super computers.  The
infrastructural network looks like getting done, and a strong central
super computer is missing to make good use of the nervous network
falling into place. Of course, wearing a watch does not automatically
mean punctuality, but if we desire punctuality as a virtue, a watch
could be of great help. So too, HPC could help to take us places. HTH.

  According to Bill Wall, who has composed a page on Chess Automatons
at http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7378/automat.htm,
Pillsbury was one of the operators behind a different machine, called
Ajeeb, that was built much later in 1868.

  Some of the operators behind the Turk, which was built in 1769, included
Jacques Mouret (nephew of Philidor, the greatest player of his time),
William Lewis (British champion), William Schlumberger (St Amant's teacher),
and Johann Allgaier (one of the strongest players in Europe, who was the
operator when it defeated Napolean Bonaparte in 1809 in 24 moves). Allgaier
was somewhat short-statured.

  There have been a number of fake Chess automatons built over the years,
but the first true chess automaton was built by a Spaniard, Torres Y Quevedo
only in 1890. Claude Shannon of Bell Labs also built an endgame machine
with electromechanical relays sometime in the 40s, prior to his seminal
work on tree searching (1949).

Recent OSS chess programs include GNUchess (descendant of the Northwestern Univ.
program that dominated computer chess in the 70s) and Crafty. Of course,
there are many commercial offerings as well.

This morning my monitor started with a deep blue screen, darker than its

or something 21 inch monitor.  I am close to the sea shore, where the 
moisture in the air is heavy and almost unavoidable. Looks like after 
three to four years of use, during monsoons, monitors cannot help not 
starting up without wierd deep dark hues, but as it warms up, it gets 
better and normal.  More servicing follows, and soon the monitor gets 
junked.

[1] How best to protect a monitor/system from moisture ?
      I do wrap them when not in use, but monitors need
      ventilation and they cannot be kept wrapped all the time.

[2] Does X or any software has anything to do with this ?

Thanks,

Goodness!  Please read this[1]

Dileep, could you please give the source links?

Once we understand history and philosophy behind an action, then we can
easily understand the implementation in a better way.  BTW, I had only
read about Macaulay's well known speech when English was introduced as a
medium of intruction in India[2]:

"The destinies of our Indian Empire are covered with thick darkness....
   It may be that the public mind of India may expand under our system
till it has outgrown that system; that by good government we may educate
our subjects into a capacity for better government; that having become
instructed in European knowledge they may, in some future age, demand
European institutions.  Whether such a day will ever come, I know not.
But never will I attempt to avert or retard it.  Whenever, it comes, it
will be the proudest day in English history."

We should deal with all this history, the way Charles Babbage dealt with
the fake chess automaton - use it to build something better.  We are
free now, and on our own.

"I have traveled across the length and breadth of India and I have not

in this country, such high moral values, people of such caliber, that I
do not think we would ever conquer this country, unless we break the
very backbone of this nation, which is her spiritual and cultural
heritage, and, therefore, I propose that we replace her old and ancient
education system, her culture, for if the Indians think that all that is

their self-esteem, their native self-culture and they will become what

a) Use it in a dry/dehumidified room, such as an air-conditioned
room.

b) Try to leave them on at all times, so the there is some residual
warmth that prevents condensation. Most monitors these days are energy-
saving, so they will not consume much power (<15W) when they're on
standby.

  No, if it's within the sync ranges for your monitor, there's 
no effect on reliability.

  The problems in Madras can be traced to dust, moisture and sulphur
dioxide in the air. If you're close to the sea, add salt to the
mix.

Using a room air conditioner/de-humidifier might help. But here are some 
 alternate tips:

Try using an air blower/table fan close to the rear of the monitor. As 
long as there is good air circulation, accumulation of moisture will be 
reduced. Technically, problems can occur due to temperature drop within 
monitors when they are turned "off". If air within your monitor is 
stagnant during this period, moisture can accumulate on your monitor's 
circuit board and within its bulky components (especially the electrolytic 
capacitors), thus slowly tarnishing exposed metallic contacts and breaking 
soldering joints over a period of time [1]. 

When you turn off your monitor, leave your room fan/blower running for 
a while to reduce moisture accumulation.  I would suggest the same before 
you power on your monitor too. Wrapping monitors is useful only if you are 
not going to use them over a prolonged period. It is _not_ recommended to 
wrap monitors immediately after power off. 

And yes, avoid using "air coolers" in a room where you use costly electronic 
equipments (computers included). 
 
> [2] Does X or any software has anything to do with this ?

No. They are just programs ;-)

[1] Some good monitors (expensive ones like Viewsonic, Mitsubishi, Sony and 
Philips) have all their soldering joints and most other metallic contacts 
within them spray-coated by plastic enamel. This explains their long life 
and also their price.

My mouse doesn't work once the machine starts. I have to run
"/etc/init.d/gpm restart" as root every time the machine starts. Has
anybody incurred this problem before? What's the remedy?

      This question is to chess players in linux. I recently
downloaded the games from 36th Chess olympiad's site. They are all in
the .cbv format. Is there anyway I can use them? My computer stores
all saved games in the .pgn format.

Bye!

Sivasankar & Chandrashekar thanks.  Leaving the monitor on all the time
should work nicely for me. We could also be more careful while choosing 
monitors in the future.

The minute we have banking + insurance + bpo on massive central servers,
many engineers would become free to work on real engineering issues like
fixing these problems in Madras and elsewhere :)

A little OT but:
I posted about the "Dreaded Deep Blue Screen" at about 8:40 AM but
Chandrashekar Babu replied to that by 7:20 AM ? Did the monsoon blues
eat up some clock ticks as well? I noticed that my sys clock lost 2 hrs
yesterday, and I reset the time. BTW, should'nt GNU Mailman be stamping
time on mails to prevent ante-dated postings?  Well, this mail is
already a couple of days old :)

Regards,
Ramanraj.

The problem has actually got to do with my machine's time settings. When I 
boot into FreeBSD and then reboot back onto Linux, I lose 5:30 hours. Oh 
well, on both OS, I've set my timezone to Asia/Calcutta (Asia/India) or IST, 
respectively. I'm a bit clueless about what might have gone wrong. Infact, 
I'm facing this issue across different Linux distros setup in multiboot 
configuration too, lately [Slackware 10.0 with Mandrake 10.1 CE, for 
instance]. 

Maybe I must add 'ntpdate' in my system startup scripts.

In some cases, this could also be caused due to a faulty (or inaccurate) RTC 
chip on your system motherboard.

I dont know if thats a good idea. Though in a typical postal mailing 
system, the postal service would stamp date and time(?) seal _on_ the cover 
of the letter, they cannot or should not change the date and time stamp of 
the letter which is _in_ the cover (which is set by the sender). I guess its 
a similar analogy in here too. 

Another good reason that I could think of: It lets us figure the time when 
someone sent an email from _his_ location. Now, if that person resided 
in the US, and GNU mailman was setup here in India (following a different 
timezone of course) and is configured to modify date/time stamp of all 
email that it forwards, the whole purpose would be defeated.

It also reminds me to keep my system time in sync, when 
someone identifies a bogus time stamp on my email ;-)


Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

FreeBSD may be the main reason, because it does not use  BIOS and may be
writing with a diff of 5:30 hrs while shutting down.  Using LinuxBIOS 
program, may solve the problem.

GNU Mailman may carefully wrap and keep the date posters give, but it
should rely on its own timestamp to archive the message. My previous
mail posted this evening was dated 2004-10-28, and archived that way
taking it for granted. For many reasons, the poster may supply incorrect
dates without any serious consequences here, but mailman could keep the
records straight by using its own timestamp for reliable future referencing.

Regards,
Ramanraj.

Subject: [Ilugc] Need help in sendmail
Message-ID: <3bb3d596041030130364e8958a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Can anyone tell me how to forward the mail from (root@localhost) to my
email id (myname@domainname.com)
the scenario is :
i wrote an script to generate an report about the disk usage,memory
usage and processor status of a system and i planned to automate this
process. so i scheduled in cronjob so that it can run every morning.
now what i am trying to do is, i want all those reports to be mailed
to my email id.
i used "mail" command to send a mail and it works fine.but the thing
is only if i start the sendmail service (opening the port 25) i am
able to get the mails from root.
i want to know is there any possibilities to get the mails from root
without starting the sendmail service (i mean without opening the port
25).i think client doesn't require port 25 to be opened. whether port
25 need to be open in client machine?
Can anyone give me the solution for the above scenario. 
Thanks in advance!
