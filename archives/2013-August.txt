This is Ubuntu but the OP is working on Debian.

The fix may not have trickled down to the Debian repos.

For eval purposes, I would suggest do it on Ubuntu server - all the
openstack + dependent packages are well integrated.

Hi,

I am very interested to learn Linux Internals and Embedded Systems and have
made some progress in that. Now I feel the need to buy devices so that I
can continue self-practice.  Should I go for Raspberry PI or something else?

Where can I can get groups who help beginners implementing projects of
industry standards?

I am not sure what project will give me a good exposure also where to go to
seek help - can anyone please guide me appropriately?

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Prakash

Did you search the internet before asking this question? A search would
have yielded results about IDEs like Eclipse, NetBeans etc. For debugging
you need to use the PHP xdebug module.

When giving examples for fg, it would be better to illustrate them with
command line programs as examples to stop them using ctrl+z and bring them
to foreground using fg.

Just my thoughts.

Hi Raja Rajan & Karthi keyan,


Thanks for showing your interest.

We have fixed the date to be 25th of August, 2013 (Sunday).
Venue yet to be fixed. It is an 1 day technical awareness program about
Free Software and Open Source Hardware targeted towards Students to create
an interest in Free Software and Gnu/Linux.

We have included sessions like Philosophy of Free Software, Introduction to
Python Programming language, Raspberry Pi, Arudino and few more. As since
you both are interested I would like to know on which you both are
volunteering to take, i.e Rasp. pi or Arduino or both?

We will take care of your travel expense to and from Pondicherry. I am
waiting for your replies, so that we could finalize the agenda as soon as
possible.

Thank You.

Can you follow the mailing list guidelines and avoid top-posting.
Though the Gmail webmail changes might make interleaved, trimmed
posting difficult, it actually isn't. After you hit 'Reply', expand
the dots which represent the email content you're replying to, quote
only the parts you are replying to and trim off the unnecessary
content.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Subject: [Ilugc] ubuntu 12.04.2 sssd service unable to authenticate with
	LDAP backend
Message-ID: <CAHhM8gADn3gLmaCLmVmmtxY48dWCEoUzmOeroQ9=adJDdZEgcg@mail.gmail.com>

On Ubuntu 12.04.2 server - has anyone been successful in using sssd to
authenticate with a backend LDAP server?  The LDAP server does *not*
allow anonymous auth.

search did not bring up any useful.  I would appreciate if you could
share your experience with sssd on Ubuntu 12.04.2

Installed sssd 1.8.6 (latest version from universe).

Installation goes fine but the package does not install a default
/etc/sssd/sssd.conf! (unlike in Debian Squeeze or CentOS 6.4)   No
issues - copied a working setup of sssd.conf file from a Debian Wheezy
host.

sssd service starts without showing any errors and also report to be
running (service sssd status)

However, netstat does not show any connections to the  LDAP server (port 389).

Thankfully - local users are able to login.   The problem is with
users defined in the LDAP DS.

In debug mode sssd shows the following (below)

# sssd -i -d 9
(Fri Aug  2 11:46:41:460876 2013) [sssd] [check_file] (0x0020): lstat

Subject: [Ilugc] Endian / pfSense - how to block Rediff but not Rediffmail
Message-ID: <CA+3=755uP=3yL8GdgoUU8QhdFTiqYvsQhHytYTO3LNnW0=Wgdg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ILUGC members,

We have implemented Endian in an Organization and everything is working
fine but we are not able to do the following:

1. We need to block rediff but not rediffmail as some of the users need to
check the mail on rediffmail accounts.

2. Just like the above, we need to do it for Yahoo also but yahoo mail
should be accessible to the users

3. How to block Facebook with https? We are able to block facebook but if
the users are using https://www.facebook.com it is accessible.

We have followed all the steps given by both Endian and pfSense (we have
tried with pfsense also and finally settled for Endian UTM)

We need to get two categories

1. 1st Category : Access only Email and Google Search and Government sites

2. 2nd Category : 1st category + internet access + block social networking
sites and adult content

All this we should be able to achieve with Endian UTM.

If any other open source UTM is able to achieve the above things, we are
ready to switch to that.

We have tried

Zentyal
Endian
pfSense

but found Endian to be very easy in configuring and we are able to achieve
around 75% of our objectives. We are not able to block certain things (as
mentioned above)

Your help will be highly appreciated.

Hi everyone,

We are not too far away from Beta 1 Release [1] for Saucy and I still see
no much of activities when it comes to testing. There is one simple fact
that we all need to be aware of. Without TESTERS, there is no System or at
least, everything will remain the same and no improvement, nothing new,
etc.

Ubuntu GNOME needs you. The more testing we do, the better, that is for
sure, no doubt about it.

New to Ubuntu GNOME?
New to GNOME?
New to Testing?
Don't know where to start from?
Have never done this before?
You think you can't help at all?
You are interested by shy?

Worry Not. If you are one of those, be sure you are the best candidate for
testing. The more you break the system, the better. That is why we call it
testing and it is FUN, trust me.

Please, Keep Calm and Test Ubuntu GNOME :)

For more information, please see this [2] link. If you have any question,
I'm here for you!

As always, thank you for choosing, using, and most importantly, for TESTING
Ubuntu GNOME :D


Thank you!

Hasn't Ubuntu gone to Unity and abandoned other interfaces? Is this a new
project?

Hello Friends,

One of my friend is doing her Ph.D. research work and she needs some info
or links on below mentioned issue. I appreciate if I'll get any support
from the community.

here is the problem:
I want to develop a version control tool (in open source) which can take
care of different versions of one component at execution time i.e. If one
application request for earlier version, system will automatically allocate
that component and if latest version is required, then that will be
provided by the model/system itself. This facility is available in .NET
technology in Microsoft. I want to develop this type of tool in open source
which take care of all available versions of same component for different
applications at system level.


Is there any tool which can perform the above mentioned job? If yes then
please share the link or the info for the same.

Suggestions are always welcome.

Thank you so much for your time.

I am not sure if I understood your question correctly. Let me try answering
anyway. Others can correct me if I am wrong.

If what you want is, a version control system that can keep track of past
versions and give you a final "release" code based on the version specified
on the run time, I think you can use *git* and a bit of scripting. You can
use git to maintain versions ("branches") and use a script to procure the
version required and then use "git checkout branchname" to change your
version to the corresponding version, build the release code and execute it.

HTH,
Abraham

There is many open source tools which has been in existence.The mother of
all was CVS which is still used by many. Post that many other versions have
come into play Subversion & GIT are some of the famous ones.

Hi,

I am a working software professional and has great desire to work on
Embedded and Linux Internals projects. I have a desktop with Linux OS so I
am able to practice Linux OS internals - but not sure how to proceed on
Embedded systems. I wish start and do projects from home as it gives a
great insight and learning doing everything from self.

But I have not much idea to begin - whom to approach or what *home* based
projects to start with - cost of devices required - is there a group online
that can help me in my personal setup and clarifications when required. I
have heard of IEEE - is it worth that I should do IEEE projects personally.

Is there a body who takes care of people like us voluntary or
professionally?

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Prakash

Not sure what you are trying to say in the above sentence, particularly
"execution time". As far as I know, version control means, a tool which
maintains different versions of a file (mostly a source file).

Are you talking about loading different version of a shared library at
runtime? what do you mean by "component" here?

Again, If "component" means "a source file" in the above sentence, then
any version control system will provide the requested version. If
"component" means "a shared library", then the application which needs
previous version of a shared library should explicitly load it using
"dlopen(3)".

I don't know .N[EU]T, so I not able to understand what you mean by
"component", "execution time" and "model/system" jurgons.

First of all thanks to all who replied to my query. Let me clear it more.
I am familiar with SVN and Git ( it keeps track of the source files). What
she want to know is:

For example: Let's assume, Software A needs Python 3 and Software B needs
Python 2.7 for it's execution and in our system we have both versions of
Python. When user executes any software (A or B) system automatically
allocates required Python libraries and keeps tracks of it.

My example may be wrong but this is what I got in my mind to make my issue
bit more clear. Please correct if I am wrong.
Is there any tool in Open Source which helps us to understand this problem?
Please share your views and experiences.

Thank you so much for your time.

I would suggest that your friend  should interact directly with the
community members, who are dealing with source code repository design
and development - git / svn / mercurial / developer mailing lists /
forums come to mind.

I am not a developer (any more) but it is quite possible that her
functional requirement may end up being a 'plug-in' for one of the
above; rather than starting from scratch.

One of the problems with Microsoft is its inappropriate use of technology to
further business needs. It started out as an OS for a single-user on a
single machine and then tried to extend that in contorted ways to become a
multi-user on multiple machines OS while still supporting the SUOASM
approach. .NET is an especially sore issue for me because I spent some
frustrating hours yesterday trying to get MS Windows 8 to install an already
downloaded version of .NET instead of repeatedly failing to download (most
likely) the same version from the Update server.

In a multiple-OS, heterogeneous environment, it is better that the
application choose the correct version of its dependent libraries, not the
OS.

Under AFS, a fileserver might store multiple versions of
executables and shared libraries (different architectures - sun4, sun5,
i386, amd64). Specific example, Perl for SunOS, Solaris, FreeBSD, Linux,
etc. A Linux machine will then only get the relevant set of directories
mounted and only see the right SOs. Projects can set up their own
environment variables to pick up modules from the right locations (from the
mounted filesystems here). Or set up ld.so.conf.

A dynamic executable (of an application) pulls in its libraries at run-time.
In a properly configured environment, which in Linux depends on the
packaging system, not on the operating system, the installer should set up
the correct links needed for all the executables in an application to run.
The installation should fail if the minimum required versions of its
libraries are not already installed. Any half-way decent packaging system
will keep a list of dependent packages, versions, and conflicts for an app.

For library upgrades on a Linux system, it is the responsibility of the
Linux distributions to repackage simultaneously those applications which no
longer work with the upgraded library version. It doesn't make sense to have
the kernel and core libraries (my definition of the Linux OS) decide which
SO version should be used by a particular application. Obviously, if there
are calls to missing/changed functions, OS error messages should be copious
and clear.

In Perl, it is possible to specify an exact module version to be imported.
See
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/260593/how-can-i-install-a-specific-version-of-a-perl-module?lq=1
and
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14332254/how-can-i-use-specific-version-of-a-perl-cpan-module

Python has virtualenv which lets you set up multiple very specific
environments of Python and modules on the same machine (I've not used it,
though). On my Linux machine, python<tab> returns:

python2, python2.7, python3, python3.2

Just python starts python2.7

> Is there any tool in Open Source which helps us to understand this problem?

Note though that both Perl and Python have their own packaging "apps" (CPAN
and ActiveState/pypi/etc.), which are independent of a Linux distro's
packaging app. and in fact the OS itself.

So, e.g., you can install either the libdevice-serialport-perl deb package
on Debian and its derivatives or the Device::SerialPort Perl package/module
on any OS, including MS Windows.
 
> Please share your views and experiences.

Dependency tracking at various stages of an application's use (compile,
link, install, run, upgrade) is not an easy task, but I don't recommend
spending time on integrating it into the OS or the "system". IMHO, it would
be better to improve packaging scripts or environments so that the resulting
package plays well with installer applications [1]. Just be aware a fine
balance may be needed between being overly strict and overly permissive when
it comes to specifying required versions.

HTH,
Sameer

[1] In the AFS environment above, it would be very nice to have a package
installation that updates client machine config files to point to
project-specific network-mounted filesystems. E.g. ld.so.conf.

Let say, Software A needs Python3, then it is the task for that
programmer who wrote Software A to specify which version of python he
needs to use. either by using '#!/usr/bin/env python3' or by checking
the interpreter version through 'sys.version'.

In the same way, if Application B needs libglib-2.0.so.0.3000.3 instead
of latest libglib-2.0.so, then the programmer who is writing Application
B needs to explicitly import the library into his application through
dlpoen().

I still don't understand what you are trying to do with Version Control
when the problem you are trying to fix can be easily fixed by the
programmer who is writing the application.

This is a LUG mailing list and we do not suggest non-free, proprietary
software here. So do not suggest proprietary software here.

And before you send your next mail to the list, I would recommend you go
through the mailing list guidelines available as a link in the footer of
every email sent to the list and use interleaved, trimmed posting style
instead of top posting.

        The best option is to run GNU/Linux on a VM. If that is not
possible, you can give MobaXterm[1] a shot. It is a single executable
that has most of what we need, including an XServer. It is GPL

Hi

Use cygwin http://www.cygwin.com/

Cygwin/X is a port of the X Window System to the Cygwin API layer for the
Microsoft Windows family of operating systems. Cygwin provides a UNIX-like
API, thereby minimizing the amount of porting required.

Guess the exact filing date and time of the millionth bug in Mozilla's
Bugzilla, and you could win a Most Splendid Package of Firefox and
Mozilla swag, including a smart laptop bag, hoodie and notebook. See
my blog post for more info on how to enter:

http://blog.gerv.net/2013/08/bugzilla-1000000-bug-sweepstake/

(I thought about offering a Firefox OS phone, but those are so easy to
get that it seemed hardly worth it. ;-)

Entry is open to all - why not have a go? And spread the word in your
part of the Mozilla community.

Message-ID: <CALV9omZg+Kt2Hod2qsonZ3AT9qa9Ah4EV=UMBWue98fYwv5Z3A@mail.gmail.com>

command: bzip2
usage: bzip2 linux command is used to compress the file. Each file is
           replaced by a compressed version of itself with .bz2 extension.

syntax: $ bzip2 [options] filename

example:

1. To display info, help and options of this command

    $ bzip2 --help

2. To compress a file using bzip2
    for example a pdf file 'sample.pdf'

    $ ls -l

     -rw-rw-r-- 1  dhana dhana     164847  Feb 23 11:24  sample.pdf

    $ bzip2 -c -1 sample.pdf > sample.pdf.bz2

    $ ls -l

    -rw-rw-r-- 1 dhana dhana     164847 Feb 23 11:24 sample.pdf
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 dhana dhana     149142 Aug  6 21:16 sample.pdf.bz2

    the file size is reduced from 164847 to 149142

    by using the option -9 instead of -1 the file gets much reduced

    $ bzip2 -c -9 sample.pdf > sample.pdf.bz2

    $ ls -l

    -rw-rw-r-- 1 dhana dhana     164847 Feb 23 11:24 sample.pdf
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 dhana dhana     147879 Aug  6 21:17 sample.pdf.bz2

    when using -1 option the file reduced to 149142
    when using -9 option the file reduced to 147879

Apologies.

But few know Redhat has been driving HPC for a while now on which
render farms run and which is sorta primary requirement for
visualization.

Or Did I miss the animation in some Recent Rajini Robo Thriller or
something like that?

So that excited me a bit.. but got bored when virt-shel qemu-
prefixed-commands started haunting me... :)

Oh that virtual network is a venerable beast I am afraid of...

Coming back it was very heartening to know that the first Open Source
Based Billion dollar Software company came to your institution and
grace it.

It is not everyday that corporate choose to engage with academia.

Congratulations !!!

Regards,

Rajagopal

PS: Surprisingly there was silence on the technical aspects of Robo Rendering

Please cite some examples.   I am interested.   IIRC, Rhythm & Hues
have their own distro (customized openSUSE) geared for all the
animation / vfx apps available on the Linux platform

"Today, DreamWorks Animation uses Red Hat Enterprise MRG, a
next-generation infrastructure that incorporates messaging, real-time
optimization, and grid functionality. "The render farm is a shared
pool of resources that services all of the movies in production at any
given time. It is instrumental in how we provide massively parallel
computing resources and re-allocate those resources dynamically for
our artists," Carstensen said. "We run millions of jobs per week and
MRG has done a fantastic job of scaling to our demand and providing
the key features for our animation production pipeline." More
specifically, the grid middleware had to find the best resources for a
job, and dispatch that job, all while maintaining very high
utilization. "Between servers and workstations we have more than 4,000
systems, each of which has to operate at peak utilization 24x7x365,"
said Carstensen."

Message-ID: <CA+1bt6T0f=PRGAnNV5Jt7SP4EkG6Na1GO32zbeoUbrnbaT=b=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am facing a strange situation in my system ( CentOS6.4 ). It is
running a Shibboleth IdP. I never faced such issue before.
Tomcat / wrapper processes are always increasing and at last it is
resulting my server outage with 'java.lang.OutOfMemoryError" error.
I increased my wrapper -Xmx value to 2048M; situation is same yet.

I killed all java process one hour back and situation was:
[root at myTest ~]# ps -eLf | grep tomcat | wc -l
93

Right now, after 50 mins:

[root at myTest ~]# ps -eLf | grep tomcat | wc -l
518

Any suggestion is appreciate.

Thanks in advance!

I am trying to Install LinuxMint 15 in this laptop.

Fujitsu Lifebook LH 532

It is a brand new laptop comes with freedos.

I created 3 partitions for / , swap and /home.

The installation went  fine.

Once restarted, it is looking for the booting device. :-(

If we go through the live, all the 3 partitions and files are there.

Any clues on this?

While in the partition section, there will be a dropdown in the bottom,
which will define where to write the boot. Select sda for that and you will
be fine.

I suppose even grub menu did not show up. Generally grub should be
installed in /dev/sda (first hard disk). You can try grub-install from
live cd (please do a web search on how to use the command) before
doing a full installation. If it fails try to re-install.

Hope this helps,

Hi,

I faced the same issue in my new HP laptop. This is because of the secure
boot system by Microsoft.
Use gparted or any partition tool from a live distribution and delete the
GPT partition in the HDD and the run your OS setup.

Bad Idea, if you are dual-booting.

graphics.h is associated with Borland Graphics Interface (BGI) library
shipped with Borland's Turbo C ,Turbo C++ and Turbo Pascal for DOS.

Unfortunately there is no easy equivalent to BGI graphics in Linux to my
knowledge. For C/C++ programming you can use XLib and many other
frameworks/libraries available for linux. For something as simple as BGI
graphics, you could use pygame, but that's for Python.

BGI was one of the biggest catalyst for my hobby and career in computing.
Totally forgot about that. Thanks for reminding me! Hours and hours of fun
during my school days :)

>I want few ideas on Python based projects. Actually, I am bit familiar with
>python but want to do hands-on. So please suggest me few python based
>project ideas on which I can practice.

There is a opensource project called "Gcompris" written on python/c. I have
forked  "chuttiMaths" from that, to develop CBSE/Tamil Nadu state-board
primary school maths activities.
I have started developing 2-3 activities. Another 20+ activities to be
developed.
Reference python code  is available.
Please contact me offline,If you are interested.

Thanks
suresh.

Suresh,

Is the ChttiMaths a public project?

If so, share the repo url here, so that anyone can have a look and contribute.

Lavanya from our list also working on her GSoC Project with GCompris only.

Hope you can contact her for more contributions.

If we have some interested volunteers, we can conduct some hackathon too.

Don't club with any other seminars. If we are not able to take this time, we can schedule this later.?

Hi Madhan, can you split this into 3 X 1 hour talks? I think this would be
more effective... We need to have a mix of topics to make the meeting
interesting...

It is difficult to split it, because we have this meeting monthly once.

We can make this session for 2 hours.

I hope sahil will take this opportunity. I have some knowledge about
webapi, oauth1.1, oauth2 and how they work. Due to my professional work,
I can't take-up this project. If someone is willing to take up. I can
help in any way possible. Its really fun programming with webapi's (even
in C), with python, you can rock on!!

Like we can create a virtual table and compare,

select cast(concat('S',lpad(sno,3,'0')) as char(6)) as missing from (SELECT
@row := @row + 1 as sno FROM (select 0 union all select 1 union all select
3 union all select 4 union all select 5 union all select 6 union all select
6 union all select 7 union all select 8 union all select 9) t,(select 0
union all select 1 union all select 3 union all select 4 union all select 5
union all select 6 union all select 6 union all select 7 union all select 8
union all select 9) t2,(select 0 union all select 1 union all select 3
union all select 4 union all select 5 union all select 6 union all select 6
union all select 7 union all select 8 union all select 9) t3, (select 0
union all select 1 union all select 3 union all select 4 union all select 5
union all select 6 union all select 6 union all select 7 union all select 8
union all select 9) t4, (SELECT @row:=0) as b where @row<1000) as a where
a.sno  not in (select distinct b.no from (select b.*,if(@mn=0, at mn:=b.no, at mn)
as min,(@mx:=b.no) as max from (select a.webno,substring(a.webno,2,4)+0 as
no from web as a) as b,(select @mn:=0, at mx:=0) as x order by no) as b) and
a.sno between @mn and @mx;

Any drawbacks in this?

Thanks

Dear Friends,

Last week, I encountered few questions in Linux Admin exam at some company.
Please help me because I am confused regarding below questions:

Q1: Install LAMP stack and install Magento. Also apply average memory and
bandwidth limitations to it.?
[ No issue in LAMP and Magento installation but how to implement limited
resources to a particular application]

Q2: Create SVN repo and write a deployment script in 30min ?

I request to all of you please share these kind of questions which help us
(like me or other aspirants) who are appearing for any Linux related jobs.
It will eventually help newbies and others to learn new things.

Also share few more interview questions over here.

Thank you in advance.

Since you're forwarding an email fully written in Tamil and this list
has a lot of people who don't know Tamil, it would have been better to
provide a translation/gist of the email content along with the Tamil

This is the English mailing list.

There is a separate ILUG-Chennai Tamil mailing list ref.
<http://ilugc.in/mailing-list/ilugc-in-tamil/>.  Perhaps that was your
intended audience.

I am using Git for quite some time, but I just use it as some magical wand
that tracks my project and with the help of few flags, commands I could
revert, reset, get back or be sure of my project.

But this site http://think-like-a-git.net gave a proper approach in
understanding git. This guy starts with graph theory and explains how it is
tightly related with git. A good read.

I prefer ascii.io than showterm.io for one reason asciiio gives option to
cancel upload, while showterm doesn't, correct me if I am wrong. I tried
both.

Hi Selva,
Linux has many distributions as per Sever and Client.
But my opinion is to get started with Ubuntu and Linux Mint.
Its all open-source you can get it through their official sites.
contact me if any clarification.

isdigit() takes a character as its input, not a string. Thats the
problem, change isdigit(x) to isdigit(x[0]).

This email thread is about writing a calculator application in GTK
using C. Do not hijack this thread with unrelated queries. Start a new
thread instead of replying randomly to existing threads. Also before
you send your next email, kindly go through the mailing list
guidelines (the link to which is present in the footer of every email
sent to this list) and avoid top posting.

Thanks & Regards,

Thank you very much.
When I compiled why didn't any warning or error message appears regards it.
Since i gave char * but actual argument is char. So error msg should appear.
If I am not correct, please correct me.

Use -Wall switch while compiling. Did you use that?

Subject: [Ilugc] Issues connecting to Internet with BSNL EVDO Modem

Hi Arun,

I tried the stupid mode =1 too. Same result.

Took the modem all the way to the Sub Divisional
Engineer's office in Kelly's and the modem works
perfectly fine on Microsoft Windows when we tested
it there.

So I am ruling out a faulty modem. I am not sure if
Signal stength is the issue because I stay pretty close
(around 2 kms) by road from the Mugappair Exchange.


I have ordered for a BSNL Broadband landline connection
for now and planning to use the modem on my mother's
Laptop which runs Microsoft Windows till I figure out how
to get it to work on Ubuntu 13.04.


Thanks anyways for your inputs.

My thoughts:
1. We can try to conduct an 1-2 Hours campaign in the evening on colleges
2. We can conduct a 1-2 hours session on benefits on linux in gated
communities
3. We can participate in Information Technology workshops conducted by
colleges
4. We can start small webcasts in tamil language so it can reach large
audience

How did you generate wvdial.conf? 

Did you run 'sudo wvdialconf' after plugging in the device?

You can go for Heroku.com and Openshift.com (both have a basic free plan to
get started) for hosting Python based Web apps. For Python standalone apps,
you can host the code at Pythonanywhere.com.

Used this slides.

Felt that we need some good collection of exercise and example
programs for the training and practise purpose.

Here are some good collection of Python Snippets for our daily usage
and Training.

Do we have any collection of simple exercise programs?

Locate requires an updatedb which is not installed in a typical

Hi Suresh,

Better you stay with command line. Thats how you would be familiar with git
commands.

For getting a grasp with the tree structure git is producing, monitor the
changes with git gui tools. I am using qGit for that. Its quite good.

Dear all,
A new National Repository of Open Education Resources is now online, and
the content is all CC-BY-SA.  It is hosted on the Gnosys platform
developed by Nagarjuna & Co.

Congratulations to them and to all others who've made this possible.
Let's see how this can be improved and expanded beyond the school-level.

Cheers,

Hi folks,

Savithri just gave me some wonderful news. The new National Repository
of Open Education Resources has been launched, and Dr. Tharoor, the HRD
Minister announced its licensed under CC-BY-SA! *http://nroer.in/home/*

I had all but given up hopes of this as despite Dr. Tharoor supporting
us on record, the NCERT Director Dr. Sinclair wasn't convinced as of
last week. I do not know what transpired thereafter, but this is a major
fillip for us!

1. To display options and info of updatedb

    # updatedb --help

2. To use updatedb to refresh mlocate database

    # locate lftp.conf

    /etc/lftp.conf
    /usr/share/man/man5/lftp.conf.5.gz
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/lftp.conffiles

    create a backup of /etc/lftp.conf as /etc/lftp.conf.bak

   # locate lftp.conf

    /etc/lftp.conf
    /usr/share/man/man5/lftp.conf.5.gz
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/lftp.conffiles

   it will not show the /etc/lftp.conf.bak file

   now run

   # updatedb

   note run updatedb as root

   then,

   # locate lftp.conf

   /etc/lftp.conf
   /etc/lftp.conf.bak
   /usr/share/man/man5/lftp.conf.5.gz

Do you have shell access? Execute the command as a background job and the
code will look something like this:

while(1)
{
    sleep ( 24 hours);
    mail();
}

PHP scripts run only when a user accesses a particular url which is routed
to the relevant script. This being the case you cannot schedule actions as
part of your web app*. You'll have to write a scheduler in PHP (aka
reinvent cron) and run it as part of your system init scripts!! So, IMO
cron is the way to go.

* unless you have another app that will ping the url at 12:10AM every day
using cron :-P

The forum didn't give me a solution. I came across cron jobs, which runs

About 4 years ago, I encountered XFS problems (could not delete files
IIRC) and tried to repair the FS (9TB) but no joy.   From what I
understood, repair requires all the memory you can give it.  I had
booted the system in single user mode and left the utility running
from Fri. evening to Monday afternoon.

By Monday afternoon, the client wanted the storage to be brought
online, so I did exactly what you did - backup the data to another
storage.

Great.

> Problem: How do I solve the phase-1 problem?
>

You may want to query the CentOS general list; there are users who
have XFS and could perhaps help you.

In my case, time was of essence so I reformatted the storage volume
(ext3) and restored the data from backup.

organiser of FOSS.in and Linux Bangalore . KDE India definitely had
its seeds sown thanks to not just the space given by the event FOSS.in

This also reminds me of KG and his python community efforts .

Prima Facie, it appears to be a bug.  The way forward, would be to
open a bug report or add your note if one already exists.

Message-ID: <CALDskywDwkh0q=ZEKDbwy1jfftnL1LwmvXL50bDg7mCLk40KsQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am creating an e-commerce website and in the process I picked
 up certain ideas that I thought was worth sharing.

People think databases are useful for ticketing, banking and asset
 tracking.

In an e-commerce website with inventory management, search
 functionality and so on database is key.

To implement a simple search bar in a website a simple SQL query
 against your database keywords and conditions applied against
 price or quantity or feedback can be very powerful.

There are basically few building blocks to an e-commerce portal.

1) Payment gateway integration(costs cash, PayU is 6k INR)
2) User login integration(gmail, facebook API)
3) DB backend for storing inventory and tracking orders
4) Ability to zoom images of products
5) Category wise listing and search and sort of product listings

That is all.

The payment gateway part is quite complicated as it involves
 banking and money and security but that is handled by a third party.

Our complication is in managing SKU(stock keeping unit), the
 order tracking(different states for courier delivery, courier progress)
 and so on.

Most of the website is a common view for all in which he browses
 through the inventory and places an order.

The user specific parts are his delivery address, his order IDs,
 his credentials like mobile number, mail ID etc.

I think it is not very complicated to do all that.

And you might want to have a page for sellers as well.

I am too developing an e-commerce site for my business using open source
CMS (wordpress and woocommerce plugin). Although there are several CMS like
magento, zen-cart etc available, I'd talk a bit about my experience with
woocommerce here.

Woocommerce provides premium (i.e. non-free) plugins to manage all the
above features.

For example they have a plugin to integrate with PayU, India merchant
account. Apart from all the things Girish has summed up nicely, I'm also
allowing users to create a "wishlist".

Which CMS are you using? Which courier company you are using for delivery?
Checkout sites like "Code Canyon". In most cases, it is convenient to buy
some code rather than reinventing the wheel.

Seller page is required when the site is just an interface between
merchants and buyers example eBay, snapdeal etc.
If the admin of the website is managing the inventory, then this is not
needed.

Oh nice. I don't have as much knowledge as you.

I just developed on my own. No third party plugins.

But for jQuery for image zoom and shopping cart.

I have heard lot of great things about Wordpress. But woocommerce not
 being free is a problem.

Yes, that is part of the "user account" page. That is also standard.

PayU integration is something we can do just like Paypal integration. I don't
 see why we should use a third party tool for that.

Oh I just wrote on my own. Courier company? That is a non issue right?

Unless I am missing something. We have to manually enter the status based on
 what the courier company tells us.

Most e-commerce websites are affiliates for some other sellers.

So clear demarcation between seller and retailer is important.

Thanks for your inputs.

My 1.5 year old 1TB is ready for it's 2nd RMA - media problems like
yours.   I have had similar problems with both Seagate and WD.

They do not make them like they used to anymore.

Nice initiative.

Having a two day hackathon for this will help to get more volunteers
and contributions.

Update here if you can lead the hackathon.

You may have to provide some training on the gcompris hacking basics.

The same  file is available in both the packages, if you are sure the
latest one will be compatible with your application you can force the
latest one to override the existing one . To be on safer side take the
backup of the existing file.

Great, Check if your windows has multiple partition and you can free one
partition for linux. If not you will have to compress a partition and
create a new partition.
Then boot from CD format partition allocate space for '/' and 'swap'
install on the partition you want to install linux.
Thats it.

Note: The cd you got with linux for you magazine is a 64 bit compatible
version. Make sure your desktop is 64 bit compatible.
If your desktop is 32 bit then u might need to download 32 bit iso and use
it for installation.
if u dont have bandwidth contact me(am in cbe) offline will provide you
with the the iso.

Message-ID: <CAG=HW5ZFB9wTY2r4fqBj+ZY6NWUYURuoCbuZur5rxZMj4+wuSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am excited to announce my new open hardware product, TINION.  It is a
hardware toolkit for teaching digital logics using  logic gates. It consist
of building blocks, where each block has input and output sockets and an
integrated LED indicator for quick and easy verification of the output.
Tinion blocks can be interconnected using plug-gable wires to construct
digital circuits.

TINION is for the user who wants to learn computer science from scratch.
The user requires :

- No soldering
- No PCB
- No Breadboard or wiring
- No detailed knowledge in electronics.

?Our goal is to make the user understand computer hardware easily and make
programming easier to learn, hence making this field motivational.?

We are going for crowd funding in September, and will be announcing the
date soon.

For further details, visit www.tinion.com .

Thank you,
Krishna

What is the port that your DVR/CCTV allows for browsing?

It could be that Airtel is blocking incoming SYN packets -- see ref
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment>

try 'telnet 122.165.84.54 <DVR port>'  and see if you get any kind of
response.
BTW, there is no response on ports 80 and 443 - save yourself the
trouble if your DVR is already configured on one of these ports.

It could be that Airtel is blocking incoming SYN packets ref
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment>
in which you are out of luck with your current ISP plan.  You may have
to go cough up more money, for a business grade service (servers
allowed on your premise).

This tutorial helped me a great deal. Made for Linux Mint but you can use
this to pick up on how to allocate memory, etc.
If you are open to any distribution, would suggest Mint 13 KDE.

I find few people from Coimbatore, perhaps you can seek their guidance on
installation.

you can use tcpdf for pdf generation, but it much take much time to code.
upto me the easiest way is build html file then convert it to PDF.
 wkhtmltopdf (https://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/) will help to convert
html to PDF. in additional this (

is very easy and fastest way to generate PDF.

Please make the effort to read/learn more about Zentyal (doc.zentyal.org/en).

Had you done so, you would have seen that It already has a DNS module.

Subject: [Ilugc] [project idea] A portal to view the local events
Message-ID: <CAND2795xgfZfDgib_PJzjCX8Xjf3ERuJMvqpTziV836mQeb=kg@mail.gmail.com>

There are many events happening around all of us.

We have to look on newspapers, or mailing lists or social media to know
what events are happening around us.

Most of us miss some events as we dont know such event is happening around
us.

Yes. We may not subscribed to all mailing lists/groups on our interested
subjects.

Who knows, some interesting event may happen in our next street.
It may be a technical talk/workshop/book release/movie release/devotional
talk/free food event etc.

Because of there is no single place to share the events, we miss them.

Just imagine a portal, where we can select the city and view all the events
happening.

Example:
The foss related events are posted here.
http://ilugc.in/calendar/action:month/

Help me to setup such portal.

Here are the requirements.

1. Event created in front end by users/anonymous. ( http://time.ly calender
paid plugin for wordpress allows this)
2. Multiple city site. like chennai.site.name / madurai.site.name /
delhi.site.name
3. cities can be added on request.


Hope we can use the wordpress and http://time.ly paid plugin for this.

Is there any other CMS supports this?

Is there any free plugin with front end submission for
drupal/joomla/wordpress?

or is there any other such portal already exists, that I am unaware of. ?

Please share your thoughts on this.

Thanks.

Subject: [Ilugc] Commandline cheat sheets
Message-ID: <CAND2797dF0p0yG_yp=osK7ALjLugK4YRqtov7niDv9BLmjovjA@mail.gmail.com>

Found some interesting project - cheat

cheat allows you to create and view interactive cheatsheets on the
command-line. It was designed to help remind *nix system
administrators of options for commands that they use frequently, but
not frequently enough to remember.


Examples :
=========

The next time you're forced to disarm a nuclear weapon without
consulting Google, you may run:

cheat tar

You will be presented with a cheatsheet resembling:

To extract an uncompressed archive:
tar -xvf /path/to/foo.tar

To extract a .gz archive:
tar -xzvf /path/to/foo.tgz

To create a .gz archive:
tar -czvf /path/to/foo.tgz /path/to/foo/

To extract a .bz2 archive:
tar -xjvf /path/to/foo.tgz

To create a .bz2 archive:
tar -cjvf /path/to/foo.tgz /path/to/foo/


Get it at

https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat

You can contribute by adding more command and cheats.

Good morning.

What do you want to know?

top can be used in '-b' mode which is useful for batch output.

You can parse the output for knowing load avg,CPU,RAM and swap usage.

And you can sort display based on processes using most CPU or RAM or RSS size.

Top is a good indication of the health of the OS.

Recently I had a very queer situation which I was running relayd in OpenBSD.

The machine was very very slow and I figured out that no process was
hogging CPU but
 the kernel was the culprit.

To know that top helped. The system usage was more than 87%.

Hello, all! I want to use my Airtel data card on my laptop, which came
with Win 7 Starter installed but I am dual-booting with Ubuntu 12.04
(which I love!) as default. The dongle works fine in Win 7 but is not
even "seen" by Ubuntu 12.04. Is there a way to make it work? Or should
I buy another dongle to use in Ubuntu? If so, which one will work
out-of-the-box?

Thanks in advance!

Dear, you have to set-up the connection firstly. Goto Network Connections
then Add  a connection in Mobile Network and do the needful then you're
good to go.

To:


OpenStreetMap(OSM) just got a better editor to edit the maps. Just sign up,
zoom in to your location, start editing, BOOM
Now, I agree Google Maps are bit sofisticated, but OSM are used by apps
like FourSquare, Flickr, Apple maps, many others and definitely it has a
huge benefit as a developer and as a normal user who wants to get/update
information about his location/business.
Any information that you add into Google is owned by Google, and shown on a
service that could in theory be withdrawn at any time (see Google Reader).
Any information you add into OpenStreetMap is licensed freely for people to
reuse as they like, so if you're adding information about your business
into OSM, it's got the potential to be promoted much more widely than if
it's just in Google Maps. The information in OSM will always be available
to use as it's not dependent on any one commercial entity.

But my system doesn't even detect the card. And there was no cd with
it as far as I remember ... in fact, I'm absolutely sure there was no
cd. Whenever I plug the device into any new comp, the software
installs from the device itself.

It's Capitel. I could not do anything because my laptop doesn't "see" it.

Subject: [Ilugc] server side javascript with node.js
Message-ID: <CALDskyxua_08x-gyzrkSGz0vDNMwakRm2KNUr4rBJGwYjMG_6A@mail.gmail.com>

I was always fascinated by javascript.

It is an amazing programming language and very hard to learn.

Now javascript can be used outside of the browser environment on the
 server side.

And you can execute shell commands too.

Read here:

http://nodejs.org/api/

I am doing a project using it.

And there is no need to run a web server with nginx or Apache.

You can also run TCP client or server with it.

Node.js is also useful for doing some nifty things to communicate
 using JSON with the browser.

Javascript and JSON are close relations and nowadays nearly everyone
 is using JSON because of the lack of restriction for making calls
 within the same domain which is an issue with CGI.

But I have not used it much.

Node.js is cool because it uses event loops, it has a libuv implementation
 which gives it a lot of functionality for performance and it is portable.

Thanks. I haven't tried dmesg. Shall try your second suggestion first.
I think Sahil also advised that. If this doesn't work, I'll do dmesg.

Some times, the device will only detect it as a USB cd-rom.Once dmesg
confirms /dev/ttyUSB0.. etc, then you are on the way.
otherwise use http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/

one more tool also cab be used for USB data card: saks3g(

Hi All,

Is there any good tool like spiceworks for complete it asset management
systems and helpdesk.

I have seen ocs and GLPi integartion, which works as like spiceworks and
also openaudit which has very limited features.

Connect the device and then run "dmesg | tail". Copy the output as
reply. This will help to know whether driver is available or not. I
hope driver will be available by default.

Prasanna & others,

I set up a new mobile broadband connection with India and Airtel as
values. But it doesn't show in the wireless menu with an icon that
looks like a bow with a drawn string, in the top bar of the screen.

Then I did dmesg and got the following as part of the rather lengthy
script (or whatever you call it) in the terminal. Looks like the
machine "sees" the data card. --

If you have already *seen* it with ocs and glpi integration, then
identify what are the missing "spiceworks" features.

Do not assume that everyone here has/knows spiceworks and know the
difference(s) to be able to recommend a solution.

I think it is getting detected as a CD-ROM. You need some tool (I
guess one is mentioned in this thread already) to make your modem to
show up.

Go to that website, read documentation on how to use the tool and you
can use your modem with Ubuntu.

 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/14/243
Background

Teaching bioinformatics at universities is complicated by typical computer
classroom settings. As well as running software locally and online,
students should gain experience of systems administration. For a future
career in biology or bioinformatics, the installation of software is a
useful skill. We propose that this may be taught by running the course on
GNU/Linux running on inexpensive Raspberry Pi computer hardware, for which
students may be granted full administrator access.
Results

We release 4273*?*, an operating system image for Raspberry Pi based on
Raspbian Linux. This includes minor customisations for classroom use and
includes our Open Access bioinformatics course, *4273? Bioinformatics for
Biologists*. This is based on the final-year undergraduate module BL4273,
run on Raspberry Pi computers at the University of St Andrews, Semester 1,
academic year 2012?2013.
Conclusions

4273*?* is a means to teach bioinformatics, including systems
administration tasks, to undergraduates at low cost.

I am also exploring SAN options because it might have lot of load if it is
NAS based solution.
Now if SAN is block based, do linux have specialised  file systems to work

SAN is generally just a fibre fabric which makes available hard disks
as a block device (and tape library as a character device IIRC)

Where often the NAS heads (typically storage servers) sit on top the
SAN exported LUNs.

Now there is a myriad of configuration options.

You have not mentioned How many LUNs you want, how many hosts will be
accessing the SAN/NAS box, whether there are HA clusters involved? Do
you require Multi-host access to same filesystem etc. etc.

Storage solution design and support is a very big business amongst the
biggies (IBM, HP, DEL, Oracle etc.) You should also consider a tape
library for back up.

Not to mention remote DR site with equivalent amount of storage.

Yes,We plan for 2 LUNS and  4 hosts/servers  will be accessing SAN/NAS.
There are no clusters. yes we require multi host access.

a) Please do not top post.

mount as RO storage initially. If you install the drivers from that

a) top post = writing you message on top of the email while replying.
When replying to email, you must answer below the every relevant point
and trim all unwanted. This is called interleaved posting and is the
most readable given that the context is clear. Please read the mailing
list guidelines.

b) RO storage = read-only storage e.g CDROM.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Interleaved_style

Its very hard for a gmail user not to top post ,infact unless you keep
looking for it you cant find the option.  The new compose introduced
by gmail will only bring lot of top posts from new users :(

@ Tapas Ray : In gmail compose check for an option plain text mode
available from side arrow ( bottom right )  , and later you need to
while replying click on the show trimmed content link which is hardly
visible ( bottom left ) and then post in interleaved format .

Unless you have a HA cluster , You cannot get away with Less number of
LUN than hosts. Think of LUN as a hard disk partition.
IT  is a Block device, There is a raw device also which Databases like
Oracle love.

If you want CIFS/NFS as the layer on top of these two LUN, Now this
will just be a file share. "Cooked" network share. Not some block
device.

Think of LUN as a hard disk partition.

Pay money to Big vendors, They will definitely come-up with the figure
that can give somebody some kinda attack ;)

Seriously such questions cannot be handled with just two small mails
with insufficient information.

It is not like buying 250 hard disk and putting them into desktop.

If you want other people to further help you, You need to say what
kind of data this humongous LUNs are going to store (Streaming media,
a large backup for all the desktops with the gory details), what types
of hosts -- is it all linux shop or is it heterogenous, network and a
lot more detailed input from you.

Then there are questions about cooling, UPS, SAN, copper network
design, what kind of redundancy and so on and so forth.

You give the input, people will perhaps give more detailed answer.

Perhaps you consider hiring people from this list  for doing the
consultancy work this design. There are responsibilites involved with
support from vendor, many legal issues, supervision of the work done
and (worst nightmare) co-ordination for this whole project with others
etc. etc. etc.

I have a client who was using FreeNAS 8, where it lost the entire
zpool during a power failure.

For storage in the range of 200TB, I would suggest to look for a
vendor to provide the solution (commercial support).   Isilon comes to
mind and then there is open-e (Linux based), nexenta is based on
opensolaris with zpool.  (I have seen Isilon in operation - I have no
commercial links to any of the products).

Avoid rolling your own unless you really really know the gut level
details of what the heck you are doing.

you can download sakis3g from sf
http://sourceforge.net/projects/vim-n4n0/files/sakis3g.tar.gz/download

just extract and chmod +x sakis3g then ./sakis3g

sakis3g has option to install usb-modeswitch then connect the modem to
internet.

So, please consider this as an open invitation for all members of

Thanks,

Ravi

Great,  but did the suggested solution work for you?

If so, then indicate it solved your problem; that would help others
who come across this thread.

Sorry, I have not been able to try it yet. Have been tied up with
health issues, among other things. As soon as I do it and it works,
I'll do as you have advised.

In the first place, I agree with Arun Khan.

On the other hand I look at it as an opportunity for a consortium of
Open source lovers, benefitters and benfactors.

What OP has as asked for a company.

We have this greatest oppurtunity as a consortium to break the cartel.

We have all the source codes, all the design technologies, components
and the expertise to pull it off including lifelong support for the
product.

This what I was envisioning sometime back When I mentioned an
integrated approach in one of my post where I was more or less
dismissed as a madman by some members.

Reductionism is ok to solve the problem.

We Indians have the expertise -- mechanical, electrical, electronics,
hardware, integration and most importantly the grit -- to deliver
these.

What we lack is a vision. or rather translating a vision into a mission.

Almost all of us are capable of that.

And we must recognise that ans pitch in.

It is ok dollar is hovering around ~70. It is ok to have greed.

But we have to satisfy the need.

I can commit this much now: if a inFLOSS consortium be formed for
solution first and then a product later, We can have a bright future.

Otherwise, we will be remain answering stupid questions about
activating some stupid data card or some stupid linux installation or
stupid jquery and json programming battles with noobie.

What are IITs and NITs doing? Sleeping or worried about their tenure?
Or just producing unemployable youths (Ask any industry person)? Where
is the research on integration and indiansation? After all they are
living off Indian taxpayers money which we pay on every toothpaste and
soap we use (remember "MRP (All taxes included?)).

Above afterall is IMHO,

Thanks and Regards

Deploy.

I have deployed GLPI+OCS for over 250 locations in a single instance.

And many more for 2++ locations.

I don't even remember the number of nodes and I can reveal the
instances (for obvious privacy reasons).

Oldest being somewhere around 2008 or so.

And all of them to my know knowledge have been chugging along all these years.

And some of earlier ones (horror of horror) on fedora (which
unfortunately have never upgraded to centos) because IT_JUST_WORKS.

So tell me where, wherever have you have you found any issues?

I am wondering if we can have some events, if there is no reply for
this request.

Without our members reply or interest, we can not have any events this year.

Please reply here, if anyone is interested in conducting some events
this year for software freedom day.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <CAAKbJMKvr3fsNPSo82REsDUBVtvTJDiMznYS_qDj8_W=tc6bRw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need to build a small os kernal which can run only one application. Say
for example eclipse.

If you have any guide for achieving this. Please do let me know.

I am planning it to start with ubuntu minimal cd or probably arch os.
Please let me know is there any alternative also.

First of all kernel does not run any application.

Moreover you cannot build a single app appliance without substantial knowledge.

It is better to go ahead along your own thinking and approach which seems to be
 a workable solution.

But it would then not be a single application OS, it is an appliance/OS with
 focus on only one purpose.

It is not hard to achieve that.

Rajagopal, with all due respect storage @ 200TB requires a different
dimension of IT enterprise infrastructure and expertise.   I am sure
you will agree that putting it together is not the main thing.   It is
the recovery in "What if ....... happens?"

Up to 10-20 TB, I feel comfortable rolling my own.

To the best of my knowledge Virtual Box OSE (open source edition) that
comes with most distros has no encumbrance.   I would suggest due
diligence on your part - read the license.

Follow list guide lines:
1. Do *not* hijack a thread with your own query - compose a *new* message.
2. Do *not* top post.

If it is the Fusioh distro you are referring to then I would suggest
go with a LTS distro like CentOS, especially if this is in an
enterprise network.  GLPI works fine on CentOS.

BTW, you never did elaborate on the spiceworks features that you found
lacking in GLPI.

Also, follow list guidelines
1. Do *not* top post   - it is not that difficult to compose
inter-leaved messages.  It need one extra click on the three ... at
the bottom of Gmail composer.

Completely thoroughly agree with you.

I have been a team member in similar projects in the past.

and I have seen "saas-bahu" issues of "ownership", fight over
anonymity, credit taking, lack of the overall project and the such.

Afterall, many such solutions are existing and working for a long time
as I know.

And most of them are run by Indians -- either in India or abroad.

And I was probing if anybody ever answers to the posers.

And as I expected, except you, it seems all the CS PhDs in the
educational institution of india are obliviously unaware of the
situation and none care. Let them issue me a death threat for making
such a statement. After all they have never been to industry and they
have never seen real world. They are all holed up in their nice
wormholes waiting for next freebies.

As to Enterpreuners, they just do not have the exposure to anything
enterprise size.

As for business owners, they think IT is cost.

As for SMBs, they want freebies.

As for panybody thinking of *any* product development in Inida, they
are heading for severe depression.

Sorry to sound cynical. but that is the state of affairs

I will just reveal this much to the size of one of  the project I was
a mere team member: x petabytes of SAN, ~5k tape library,
over 80 servers and god knows how many copper network switches and
directors. nuff said.

Fine we are not in a position to make all of these, but we should be
in a position to integrate these at least with confidence.

Exactly, Where is the "enquiring mind" which takes risks and where are
those who are ready to back them -- financially and otherwise say to
get few alpha and beta customers?

The Indian mind has to look not only ahead and upwards, or doller will
shoot them down.

Where is the spirit of jugaad?

Who was one of Sun's, Gupta, GT.M  database, founders?

When I started career, APLAB dared to UPS and it is still a leading brand.

Of course no one single company can do that. ut I was suggesting a
consortium which takes responsibility as a whole and each module's
responsibilty is taken by at least two members (no SPOF). Of couse one
can say that the consortium itself can be a SPOF. But at least think
at that level.

How otherwise the opensource could have come into being? how could
have samba be born? how could have postygresql be born, how could have
apache be born?

I am an optimist. I was just mentioning a dream which is realisable.

Considering what I have said above, 10-20TB  should be kid's play.

I think this list members should be widen and deepen its vision than
designing website and worrying about checkboxes and semicolons.

Above of course IMHO. No hard feelings towards anyone.
