Subject: [Ilugc] KERNEL / DISTRO / DESKTOP / APPLICATION interdependency?
Message-ID: <4135518C.40903@tandbintl.com>

Dear Friends,

I have installed latest 2.6.8.1 kernel on my Redhat 8.  I installed xine 
multimedia player also. It works fine with amazing performance. That too 
I am working on terminal and other GUI applications simultaneously 
without any performance issue. seeing this, i have some questions in 
general.

1. What way the application I am installing is related to the kernel? 
i.e Whether the applications depends tightly on kernel version? why I am 
asking is this, many applications are labelled for distro, not for 
kernel version. IN SHORT I WANT TO KNOW THE DEPENDENCY OF KERNEL 
VERSION, DISTRO VERSION, DESKTOP (KDE, GNOME..) AND APPLICATION WITH 
EACH OTHER?

2. Since I found that many latest applications run comfortably with 
latest kernel, Can I keep my Redhat 8 distro undisturbed with only 
kernel update of 2.6.8.1. If I do so what are all the pros and cons on it?

3. If I want to update my KDE, What I am suppose to do? I found so many 
KDE related rpms and src.rpms on www.kde.org. How to go about it and 
where to start with it?

Just  because  something is  a  GUI app  doesn't  mean  it would  suck
CPU/memory/disk.  It  all depends  on the app.   A gcc running  on the
terminal is more CPU hungry than, say, an XMMS running hi-fi plugins.

What do you mean by "many applications are labeled for the distro"?  I
cannot   think   of   distro    specific   apps   (unless   its   some
core-distro-related app  like a  package manager (apt-get  for debian,
rpm for redhat, etc.,.).

In short, The kernel is not really an issue as long as the app is only
using standard  libc, other library  calls. For example, you  can well
compile  the same  "hello world"  code on  FreeBSD, Linux,  HURD, DOS,
etc.,. It depends on the application  and what it is trying to do. For
example,  if  you  wrote  an  application that  keeps  polling  for  a
particular  file in  /proc/sys/wherever/wherever... your app is procfs
dependant.  So if  either you  are  on a  kernel which  does not  have
/proc/sys OR if you have disabled procfs, your app wont work.

A well designed application *should* not depend on a specific kernel. Of 
course, newer kernel updates provide more features, support more hardware 
 and fix a couple of bugs (and sometimes introduce new bugs). Most 
applications do not tightly depend on a specific kernel version (atleast 
most end-user apps dont). Infact, lots of applications that work on Linux, 
do work on other other platforms too (like *BSD, Solaris, HP/UX, 
<cough>Windows</cough>). So, a kernel update should not impose a 
problem.

Thats mostly because of the packaging mechanisms that most distros follow. 
As most applications are available as binary packages (RPM, DEB, etc), one 
package might have a strong dependency on another package, that too, for a 
specific version. Due to this, most binary application packages are labelled
for a distro. 

You can always (almost) download the source tarball for your favourite 
application and build on your machine without having to worry about 
distro-specific requirements (well, mostly). Distros like Gentoo will make 
this task easier for you.

You can safely update the kernel alone to enjoy the benefits of new features 
and performance increase (at times). Though, it is wise to have a copy of 
the stock kernel (the one that comes with your distro, by default) and 
configure your boot loader for a "Safe boot" option to boot from the stock 
kernel - this could be of great help if at all something fails/breaks due 
to a kernel update.

If all you want to do is install the binary package (without having to go 
through the pain of compiling the sources), download the RPM packages and 
install them in the order (as mentioned in the installation docs of KDE).

You can add 'gaim' into

to start gaim as soon as you log onto your gnome session.

but even then there should be some metadata regarding the dependencies
.. right? then how is this easier.

what i am asking is this... can a gentoo user download a package from
any arbitrary source and expect portage to automagically compile it
for him, taking care of the dependencies.

or should he download it from some specific site that has put together
the gentoo meta-data.

if at all, the device drivers are most likely to be the first to be 
hit by a  newer  kernel. device  drivers coming with the kernel tar 
ball will (almost) always work  with the new kernel. but if you are 
using a  device driver,  which you  got from the manufacturer's web 
site and not through kernel source, test that device first with the 
new kernel, and make sure the device is working well. if not, check 
the manufacturer's site for a newer version corresponding to the new 
kernel.

"Dependencies" do hold on Gentoo. The point is, its _supposed to be_ easier 
to 'emerge package' on gentoo and expect gentoo to automagically download, 
and build the package on your behalf. Almost all package management tools 
have these dependency-trap. Only slackware doesn't care about it.

Yes, as long as the version of the package matches to the ebuild file stored 
in the portage repository. But doing so, is a pointless effort IMO.

  Yes, you should. The only userland dependancy that needs to be upgraded
for linux-2.6.x is modutils, which I upgraded to modutils-2.4.25-8 (Google
for this; there are probably more recent versions around) on Redhat 7.3.
The same should work on RedHat 8.0 as well, if built from SRPM.

  You can simply install the kde rpms from the RedHat 8 CDs, or better
still, rebuild the SRPMs from RedHat 7.3, which doesn't have any of the
Bluecurve crap. If you choose to go with source from kde.org, there
will probably be a number of dependancies to resolve (I haven't tried
that yet).

Thanks Chander.. I have already installed latest modutils and kernel 
2.6.8.1.

But I have a doubt. I already have KDE 3 which was installed with RedHat 
8. Now I want to upgrade it to the latest KDE. I have to uninstall the 
present kde or i have to proceed with the upgrade option?

Also note that 2.6 is much different from 2.4 in terms of

  Upgrading a package actually removes the presently installed version of
the package and then installs the new version - the effect is almost the
same.

  It's generally simpler to upgrade, because you can avoid having to deal
with a whole bunch of other packages which have dependancies on the package
that is being upgraded (as long as there is no dependancy on the 
specific version).

  However, for something as complex as KDE, with all the version dependancies
on it, it may be approximately the same effort to uninstall and re-install.
Difficult call to make, especially for a bleeding edge package like KDE 3.3.
Try it out and tell us how it went :-).

Hint: set aside about a day or two for this task.

  Yes, on the whole it is a huge improvement on the desktop, but there
is at least one new side-effect - on Xine, when you bring the UI controls
into focus, it gets the interactivity boost, while the window displaying
the video gets a lower priority. The net effect is that it starts dropping
frames the moment you try to adjust anything on the UI window, even
the volume control. Click on the display window again, and video immediately
becomes smooth with no frame drops.

  I suppose I can live with this, but it wasn't that obvious on 2.4. It's
only visible on a relatively slow CPU, at any rate.

If you can get hold of rpms for ur distro (RH 8 here) then an upgrade
is the easiest way to go.  I came back from holidays yesterday and in
the meanwhile, KDE 3.3 was released and binary packages found their
way to the SuSE supplementary ftp tree. When I ran apt-get update &&
apt-get upgrade.. it downloaded and installed 3.3 and all I had to do
was relogin to enjoy the latest goods from KDE.

On a side note, there's nothing much that has changed since KDE 3.2.
Konqueror is leaner, kopete has some UI fixes, and some general
pruning. The only change that's worthwhile for me is the new Kmilo
service - a port of tpb for KDE. Now I can get some nice gui to go
with my thinkpad's buttons.

  | how can i know which boot loader my kernel is using 
  | i ahve lilo.conf.anaconda in /etc i hope i have lilo
  `--------

lilo will use /etc/lilo.conf rather than /etc/lilo.conf.anaconda
(or any other config file) by default, if you don't happen to 
use the -C flag to specify the conf file. so please verify. it 
shouldn't happen that you see one thing and get something else.

So if /etc/lilo.conf.anaconda is your config file, run lilo with
# lilo -C /etc/lilo.conf.anaconda

to know which bootloader is installed .. ? availability of lilo's
config file doesn't mean that lilo is your boot loader. it means
that the package lilo is installed. Lilo or Grub, if your bootloader,
would prompt with their respective names when the bootloader menu 
comes. If you see a graphical screen, use Cntl-x to go to command 
line in case of lilo (is it the same with grub?)

  | image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.20-8
  |         label=linux
  |         initrd=/boot/initrd-2.4.20-8.img

pretty much like how the current kernel is specified in 
lilo.conf. 

image=<path to new kernel>
	label=new_kern
	read-only
	root=/dev/<partition>

To know the root <partition>, do a 'du -h' and see where the 
root filesystem '/' is mounted. Make sure you have compiled 
and installed your modules for the new kernel.

How does the kernel know which process' window has focus and give it an
interactivity boost?  Isn't this behaviour just a xine quirk?

I would not want my compiles to get lower priority when my window focus
is on mutt :-P

The kernel knows many tricks :)  The kernel divide tasks into 
two categories  - 

1. Processor bound
2. I/O bound

Processor bound tasks spend most of their time slice executing 
code, while I/O bound tasks spend most of their time waiting 
for I/O, interrupts etc.

The interractive tasks (games, editors etc. ) are all I/O bound 
tasks while gcc is an example of a processor bound task.

To give a 'feel' of interractivity to the user, the kernel gives 
higher dynamic priority to the I/O bound tasks (interractive tasks) 
than Processor bound tasks.

The billion dollar question is - how does the kernel know which 
task is what bound ? Simple - the kernel 'observes' the tasks. 
Each task starts with a default dynamic priority of 0 (ranging 
from -20 to 19, -20 being the highest priority [1]). If the kernel 
observes that the task is using up all the time slice allocated 
to it, in executing code, and not sleeping, waiting for I/O, 
kernel knows that this is a processor bound task, and marks it
so. 

On the otherhand, if a task spends most of its time sleeping, 
waiting for some interrupt or data, it is marked as I/O bound 
task. These are given higher dynamic priority.

So when you click on a window, the mouse interrupt handler is
executed on behalf of the window manager (which the kernel must
have observed to be a I/O bound task :)  ), and hence gave it a 
higher priority. The window is highlighted immediately to give 
you a feel of high interractivity.

This is my theory: When  your window gets focused, your window manager
is the process that gets the  "event" and it gets higher priority. And
since  it  got  the priority,  xine  gets  lower  CPU cycles  for  its
rendering.

  Good question - I'm not exactly sure how it works, but there is an
priority boost for all processes that get input from
HID devices and output to the screen. When a window gets focus in X,
it gets a big boost, at the expense of stuff that's running quietly
in the background.

>  Isn't this behaviour just a xine quirk?

  Nope, it's most visible in Xine, but applies to just about any GUI
program or in general to any program.
>

  Try doing two compiles side-by-side in two xterms and switch focus from
one to the other. I need to check this out, but I think the effect is
observable.

As far as I understand, this must be an issue relevant to the default 
I/O scheduler on 2.6 kernel (Anticipatory I/O scheduler). This could be 
somewhat worked around by setting the default to be "CFQ I/O scheduler". I 
guess a kernel recompile would be required (to enable CFQ sheduler support) 
for this. 

I've been using the CFQ I/O scheduler on one of my machine (VIA 
C3/733MHz/128MB RAM), and I find movies and music to play more smoothly with 
this one.   

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Thanks, I'll check this one out. My configuration for the machine on which
I tested Xine on 2.6.8.1 is *exactly* the same, Via C3/733/128MB. The main
idea behind the 2.6 upgrade was that it was impossible to do DVD playback
on 2.4 on this machine - it dropped too many frames. Using 2.6, it's much
better, but of course the poor FPU performance of the C3 is a
limiting factor.

Have you tried VeXP on your machine? This is a specially patched version
of Xine that's been released by Via primarily for C3 CPUs and Via graphics
chipsets. I haven't tried it yet - I'm still on stock Xine 0.9.13.

VeXP ? Sounds cool. I'm downloading it right now. Oh, by the way, my 
motherboard is ASUS CUSIFX model (with the SiS630E chipset). Will it support 
(lacking?!) features on the SiS630 video card ? 

Anyways, thanks for the info on VeXP (I'll try it over the midnight perhaps)

  I'm generally disinclined to touch anything from SiS, but YMMV.

  The main speedup in VeXP seems to be from better support for the
hardware features of the Via integrated Northbridges (PLE133, CLE266),
so I guess that it would work better on a motherboard with a Via
chipset (Apollo Pro, 8601A, Epia or similar).

here's something from

MailMan 

If you run a MailMan-based mailing list, you can disable HTML 
email list-wide. 

Go to the "Content filtering" page in the administrative interface, 
select "convert text/html parts to plain text" and bid HTML messages 
on your list a fond farewell. Actually, sending them off to oblivion 
with a scornful parting shot is more like it.

Linux Desktop Conference 2004, organised by gnomebangalore
(http://www.gnomebangalore.org) is being held on September 25th at the
PESIT Auditorium, Bangalore.

The focus of the meet would be on Development for the Linux Desktop.
It will also establish a general direction to the growth of Open
Source development in India, pertaining to the Linux Desktop.

The meet features talks from eminent Open Source pioneers and
developers including Nat Friedman (http://www.nat.org/). These talks
would be a window to the Open Source movement in general and Linux
Desktop Development specifically.

The conference aims to provide a singular platform for the pioneers,
the contributors and the wannabees of the Open Source movement.

The key highlights of the meet will be:

1. Product development, the Open Source way.
2. Exploring the development frameworks and tools for the Linux
   Desktop.

But how does this make a difference? I am still a user... and I do not
want to register under my company's name because
1. they do not sponsor me
2. i know for sure that they will not be happy if they found out (yes
there are such kind of people in the world).

So should I register under my college name?

15 Special Files
****************

In normal circumstances, CVS works only with regular files.  Every file
in a project is assumed to be persistent; it must be possible to open,
read and close them; and so on.  CVS also ignores file permissions and
ownerships, leaving such issues to be resolved by the developer at
installation time.  In other words, it is not possible to "check in" a
device into a repository; if the device file cannot be opened, CVS will
refuse to handle it.  Files also lose their ownerships and permissions
during repository transactions.

Hi!

I would like to know of any boards available
(economical) at Richie street or in Chennai (in
general) that I can use for building an embedded linux
system. It can be with any processor (ARM/MIPS/...).
Does anyone have any Embedded Linux distros
(Bluecat/RTLinux/FlightLinux/...)? 

The host is an x86 machine. The target can be x86 or
non-x86 (doesn't really matter). 

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Reminds me of the SunOS days when you could make your program run faster
by performing useless IO - randomly typing keys on the keyboard while its
running, or by calling printfs periodically inside cpu bound code.

Hmmm...  I would like to point out that it's the X server that reads the
mouse device not the window manager.  And following this logic, it will
be the X server that gets all the CPU.

The kernel doesnt use the boot loader.

You can use any boot loader for the purpose of booting your new kernel.

type `lilo` as root and if you see that the command is preent the you
can rename the /etc/lilo.conf.anaconda to lilo.conf in the same
directory and type lilo -v to see if the changes have taken place.

thanks

  A Simputer is not an embedded Linux board, it's an end-product.
And it's not competitive on price-performance.

  Embedded Linux distros are really not distros in the linux
sense; they're more like cross-toolkits that install on a
standard x86 Linux box and help to build binaries for the
embedded target. The distros don't actually run on the embedded
target itself. You can download some toolkits; some were on
the LFY CD; and you can build most of the stuff from scratch
yourself - this is what I recommend, although it's the most
time-consuming alternative.

  Your best bet is to use AT-type PI/PII/Celeron/Via boards,
which you can get from most hardware maintenance shops for
Rs.1k or less. Almost any other alternative (especially
non-x86 development boards) is hugely expensive and
significantly lower in performance, e.g. a MIPS Malta
development board retails for $10k and runs at about 50 BogoMIPS.
(For comparison, a Via C3/733 + board sells for <$40 retail
and does ~1400 BogoMIPS).

Ramanraj, thanks for the link. There's probably some missing context
here and I'll try to fill in some history.

W. Daniel Hillis (Danny for short) lived in Calcutta during his childhood,
when his father was a visiting researcher at ISI in the late 60s. Later,
he studied at MIT. Danny was primarily a physicist, who switched to
computer architecture. For his Ph.D., his thesis advisors were Claude
Shannon and Marvin Minsky, both pioneers in various fields of EE and CS,
including AI. Danny submitted his doctoral dissertation in 1986 on
the Connection Machine, which subsequently won an ACM Distinguished 
Dissertation award. The original paper appeared in the journal "Physica",
and the full dissertation is available as a book from MIT press.

The paper ignited a sweeping revolution on the way researchers thought
about SIMD (Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data) architectures, which
had previously been seen as academic curiosities and discarded in the
60s and early 70s after several early machines had been built 
(Burroughs Illiac IV, Goodyear Staran, ICL DAP, and several others)
and studied. The main reason that the early SIMD machines
failed was because people were trying to parallelize problems that
were intrinsically sequential, and Amdahl's law destroyed any speedup
that may have been available on the parallel portions.

Danny proposed to attempt solving only highly-parallel problems on
the Connection Machine. Since he was at MIT, and his advisor was
Minsky, it seemed obvious to attempt classical AI problems including
Machine Vision, Perception, Cognition, etc. Danny was able to
construct a full prototype of his connection machine, which
consisted of 65536 simple 1-bit processors in a 12-dimemsional
hypercube of 4096 x 16 processor-clusters, and demonstrate certain
massively parallel AI applications on it. Along with Guy Steele
(of Common Lisp fame), they developed extensions to Common Lisp to
support SIMD computation, and this was called CM-Lisp.

In the next chapter, Danny approached Boston-area VCs and obtained
funding for his company, called Thinking Machines Corp., which
built Connection Machines and sold them to research organizations
and Universities. The first machine that TMC built was the CM-1.
Subsequently, they realized that the commercial market needed
floating-point arithmetic support, as well as programming in
familiar languages like FORTRAN, so they incorporated these
features in later machines, from the CM-2 to the last one, the
CM-5. The original CM-1, however, remains the most successful
SIMD machine sold in the history of computing to this day, having
sold over 170 installations.

However, the company did not fare well in commercial supercomputing,
where most of the problems (CFD, FEM, etc.) were numerical and not
symbolic. Also, between the period between 1985 and 1994 (when TMC
sold its last machine), the speed of the Intel x86 line of micro-
processors increased from 0.1 MFLOPS (80286) to ~100 MFLOPS peak (Intel
Pentium 200), making them very suitable for tasks that previously
required departmental supercomputers costing up to to $10M. TMC, whose
installations sold for up to $5M each, could not compete in this
new era where machines were typically $100k or less, and could solve
most of the commercial supercomputing problems that companies were
actually interested in.

 The company went bankrupt and shuttered its doors. In 1996/97
timeframe, Yale University unplugged its Connection Machine, and
the unit was scrapped and sold to one of the engineers
who had designed it, for $500. It was subsequently moved
to San Francisco and used as a coffee-table (it had nice red LEDs)
in one of the first Internet Cafes in the world :-).

So ended the last attempt at commercializing SIMD in the world, and 
around this time, competing technologies started dominating the
HPC arena:

1) Message-passing clusters (Beowulf, Mosix and many others) using
Linux on standard x86 or COTS CPU nodes.

2) Shared-Memory or NUMA multiprocessors, sometimes also using Linux.
This last version is presently the most successful commercially, in
the form of machines like the SGI Altix. The fastest machine on the
planet, the $350M NEC Earth Simulator, is also a NUMA machine.

Danny's India visit: In 1987, Danny was awarded a Ramanujan Prize by
the trust in Madras that administers it, and visited Madras to receive
it. He also participated in a conference on parallel processing that
took place at IIT Madras at the same time, where he basked in the
star-glory that covered him at the time (from the ACM award
and the Ramanujan prize, among many others). My own B.Tech thesis
was on distributed computing, and I interacted with him during the
conference and found him to be very friendly, approachable and helpful.

(I'd also add that had the DoE policy makers understood even a little
bit of the ideas that he was enunciating, they never should have 
attempted the disastrous CDAC project, which tried to use transputers
in an MIMD architecture. But that's the subject for another long story).

I don't think that it is legal to share books (photocopy or anyother form) 
which are not under open license. It is as bad as software piracy.

Hi,
Some time back I have heard of something
like Processors containing Biological materials
instead of the usual silicon stuffs  has been
invented. It was also mentioned that this processor
is very good, etc.,

I forgot the name of the processor or the name
of the Technology. I tried to google. But, I was
not successful in fishing out the exact stuff
which I was mentioning earlier.

If anybody knows the Terminology or the web sites
for the above, please tell me.

Thanks

Google for "DNA computing" or "molecular computing".
BTW, this is very early stage stuff, and nothing
practical is likely to come out of it for the next
50 years or so.

Yep, you are correct. The display server receives the user inputs 
- mouse, keyboard etc. These signals are sent to the remote 
(or local) client apps. This ideally makes both the server and 
client as I/O bound processes becuase both, apart from other work, 
wait for signals.

But can't say anything abt the server's priority if its running on 
Windows   :(

I don't know what rules you have for calling a board an embedded linux board.

But Any reference board that has linux can be called as a embedded board.
Simputer is based on ARM platform and all the tool chain for arm is freely available for linux.
It has JTAG for debugging.
i can only think of this board in india.

fellowships to attend this conference. Note: this will pay your conference
attendance fees, and cover your hotel and food expenses in Japan, but you
have to finance your own airfare, which will be fairly costly [Air India
flying to Kansai Airport, Osaka, from bombay / delhi would be the cheapest
- or try Singapore Airways / Thai Airways though it will be a lot
costlier]

1. Spell better than you do - you dont want your future employer to 
think you failed your english exams, do you?

2. Go visit a career counsellor on what job you want to choose

3. Work in open source projects in your spare time if your job doesnt 
give you scope to do that

That was not my point. Cost is one of the many factors. As pointed
out by Shiv, Simputer is an end product for the layman. And going
by its features, its _not_ cheap. 

If what your need is a motherboard, will you go for a new computer?

I Think i need to write in a more detailed manner.
The requirement here is any development / reference board that runs embedded linux.

There are lots of devices avalable in the market some arm based, some mips based and some power pc based.
Mostly all these devices run an embedded os ( be it nucleus / vxworks / qnx / embedded linux / Embedded Windows ).

So now the question comes which device / eval board i select so that i can run embedded linux on it.
Also it should be available in chennai / india.

for this one can either purchase some device ( as you said a pda/ cisco router/ any thing ) and then wipe of the original stuff there and put linux into it by cross compiling for that target).
The issues that may arise are you don't know about what boot loader it has, whether it can be as straight forward as i have described. what about debugging / console port etc.

Instead what you can do is buy a device which is available in market which has already good support / manauals/ details on boot loader etc. and that's why i suggested a simputer.

But if you want to buy a cisco router and then want to put linux into it. I wish you all the best : -)

Hope this clarifies all your doubts.

Try this sequence:

      xhost +localhost
      su -
      export DISPLAY=:0.0
      
Then, try running your X application.

Hi!

Thanks for all your inputs.

I am only looking at boards, no computers.

I shall go for a x86 arch board.

There are many possibilities on how to proceed. Anyways, here's a quick 
summary of one possible method:
Boot from the Fedora Install CD-ROM, start the installation, and in the 
disk-druid (partition setup screen) - create a new partition out of the 5 GB 
free space, and proceed with installation on that partition. If possible, at 
the Boot loader setup, dont install Grub in the _MBR_ (if you want to use 
LILO i.e.). After setup, boot into Mandrake, and configure your 
/etc/lilo.conf and add the relevant entry for booting Fedora (and run 
/sbin/lilo).

Chandrashekar Babu.

Thanks for the link.  As per the suggestion at the link, it worked.

1)  xhost +localhost
2)  su -
3)  export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0

But why (1) has to be executed as a normal user?  Why not as root
itself since root has all the powers?  I tried executing (1) & (3) as
root but didn't work.  Just wondering what might be the reason.

Assume you are root of machine X. That won't help you to control machine
Y. When you access a remote display (localhost:0.0), you have no contol
over it, since, it is as though you are accessing from a remote machine.
Only the person who started localhost:0.0 can decide who can connect to
it.

Are you paying high prices for software, and then being told how to use it? 
This software is FREE!

Free software gives you a number of freedoms. You are free to use it, copy it 
an unlimited number of times and distribute it to others. You can access the 
program's design and modify it to suit your needs. It's free of advertising and 
yes it's free of charge too!

THEOPENCD is a collection of high-quality programs that run on the Windows 
platform. Simply insert the CD to read about the different applications and 
select those that you wish to try.

THE LINUX LIVE CD is a whole operating system complete with a range of programs 
that will run directly from your CD drive without installation. Just insert the

Then you have lilo installed.

cp your /etc/lilo.conf.anaconda to /etc/lilo.conf make appropriate
changes in that file to point the image to your new kernel, then
re-run lilo -v.

Because a very large number of candidates have perfected the art of
`preparing' for exams (both academic and companies') and the art of
giving the `right' answers to interview questions, while not all the
interviewers have  perfected the art of detecting such `prepared'
responses.

Clarification: I only have the CD with "The Code", in .avi format. We've
screened this at MIT as well as Asan Memorial. We have multiple copies
of this CD, with Saha (orig), Raman and others.

 I don't have and haven't ever seen "Revolutions OS" in any form. A DVD
is rumoured to be available with Muthu (?).

 Getting a legal issue of this DVD is assuming some urgency, I think.

Okay, then we should be screening "The Code" then.  Do you any idea
about the length of the movie?

What is wrong in preparing for an exam/interview? If other competitors
do not prepare, it is their fault. Your reply (IMHO) seems to criticise
a person who prepares.

I agree with both of you.  IMO this is particularly bad in Academic
world (preparing).  They just mug-up the text. But when seeking for
jobs I don't think anything wrong with preparing for it as long as he
is not following dirty shortcuts.

 Apart from the above, companies are intrested in hiring tool-smiths
 than the person who knows howto do things and how things work.
 
 You ask questions like how it works you will be less valued in the
 market. That is the reason we get all crap software. Ask people why 
 we use database, they give crap answer than ACID properties. I 
 am sure many of the people doesn't question why database? Why XML.

I agree, not many who graduate from college to join a software house really 
understand what they are doing. However, this is not all bad, a person who 
can think for himself will have quite a tough time working in most large 
(software) companies anywhere in the world.

For what it's worth, the famed Microsoft interview which spawned books such 
as "How Would You Move Mount Fuji? Microsoft's Cult of the Puzzle - How the 
World's Smartest Company Selects the Most Creative Thinkers" [1] is what I 
would classify as a "form interview" [2]. In a "form" interview, the 
interviewer comes armed with a form with many statements and "Yes" "No" 
checkboxes next to each. The interview is usually so predictable that a well 
prepared, or an astute candidate can if he/she so desires get selected 
merely by answering the expected (not necessarily right) answers. Naturally, 
I classify a "form" interview as the worst possible type of interview. [3]

The good interview is obviously one that accurately measures the capability 
of an individual. Most companies need mindless grunts that do their bidding 
unquestioningly, and the "form" interview is an excellent tool to find what 
they are looking for (hence by weird logic the form interview too is a good 
interview).

Nothing is wrong in preparing, but a lot is wrong in `preparing' by 
merely
looking up the question papers etc., IOW knowing how to answer the
questions asked is not the same as knowing the issues these
questions deal with.


This sort of `preparation' is bad enough when it comes to Technical
subjects, but even for HR questions people come `prepared' with
canned answers.

For example, it is very very likely that the OP answered  quite
a few questions on his career plans and why he chose Novell
as part of his HR interview :-)

Rigth from school days students (we) are trained to do so!

This can be best *avoided* if schools and colleges are motivated not
to keep any sort of attendance statistics and allow bringing Books to
the examination hall (think how the teachers will be forced to set the
exam questions if it was Open-Book style).

you are missing the difference between actually knowing a subject and

  I've attended several courses with open-book exams, and most of them were
moderately difficult - but there was one course with a take-home, open-book
exam, with a deadline of 3 weeks for submission of solutions; but even a
single copied incorrect solution would guarantee an F (failing) grade. OTOH,
an incorrect but original solution might still get partial credit.

  I was still at 0 out of 30 problems on the night before the deadline.
This was the pre-web era, but I managed to solve 1 problem that night,
and ended up passing the course.  My understanding was that about 50% of
the class was stuck at 0/30, and the remaining were mostly on 1/30 or
2/30.

  Do you see the drawback with copying in that take-home exam? The odds were
overwhelming that they'd have copied an incorrect solution. About 40% of the
class ended up with an F as a result of this, ensuring that many who got
0/30 on the test but did not resort to copying cruised comfortably ahead.

Message-ID: <lqvfevvap6.fsf@mail.kongu.edu>

Hi all,

        Do you people have any idea where the 'hardware switch' for
        the centrino's RF is present in a Wipro Little Genius laptop? The
        customer service people have no clue of what I am talking
        about.

        Most laptops have either a hardware/software switch, which is
        switched off to save power among other things.

        Im having a difficult time trying to figure out where the
        hardware switch is so I can use the 802.11b inside.

output, in messages:

So I am wondering if any of you had faced a similar situation.

its usually on the sides of the laptop .. or near the wifi antenna

if you cant find it assume its a s/w switch and you can just get an app 
(on sourceforge) for software rf switch on / off - google for it

My acer travelmate 292 fxci has a hardware RF switch that I can easily 
find so I havent run across this problem before

I use ndiswrapper  for the centrino functionality. The way I switch
off wireless (which is rarely) is by 'modprobe -r ndiswrapper'
Something similar should work for you too, imo.

Hi:

 I have the Revolution OS DVD with me. There is no legal issue in
screening the movie. We can screen it and also we can send an email to
the Revolution-OS team to add our screening place and date in their
website. The link for the screening is given below.

 http://www.revolution-os.com/screenings.html

 I wanted to screen this for a long time, because of this being a DVD we
had some delay/cancellation in screening. I tried converting this to VCD
by giving to third parties and the output did not turn out very well. The
Revolution-OS is a must see for the free software and open source fans.

 Let me know when you need this and I will try to do the needful. Thanks.

What do you mean by "copying incorrect solution" ?  Does that mean
that if 29 out of 30  solved correctly with one being "coppied
incorrectly" will lead to 'F' grade?

Is it advisable to switch to fedora2.
which fedora core has stable kernel of 2.6.
I am using pentium4.
Can somebody throw light on the merits and demerits of

Find which cron file it runs out of (cron.daily i think) and disable it

  Yes, a plagiarized incorrect solution, if found to be identical on
two submitted sheets, would guarantee an F grade for both the submitters.
OTOH, if they had independently arrived at the incorrect solution, no
penalty would apply; and depending on the originality of the approach,
might get partial credit for both.

  The problems were all hard, between M40 to M50 level of difficulty [1],
if you use Knuth's terminology. Part of the skill was to avoid wasting
too much time on the M50 (open/unsolved) problems, and to focus on
solving at least 1 or 2 M40 problems. An average student could definitely
have solved at least one in 3 weeks with just a few hours at the
library. And getting just 1 correct would have got a B grade, and 2 would
have got an A grade. One could even submit a blank answer sheet, get
0/30, and hope for a C or D. But given the ingrained cultural mindset in
most of us to take shortcuts to get ahead, many did cheat and were
discovered - netting them a straight F and 3 wasted credits.

[1]. A typical M50 problem of those days might have been to show and
analyze a polynomial-time deterministic primality testing algorithm.
At that time, none existed - so it was definitely an M50 (open) problem.
You could avoid it altogether, or get partial credit by showing an
incomplete (but original) approach to solving the problem. Or you could
get 1 point by spending about 4 years and solving it, like Manindra
Agrawal and his two students Kayal and Saxena did :-). Today, of course,
that problem would only rate an M45.

  It's fairly trivial to upgrade a RedHat 7.x, 8 or 9 installation
to the 2.6 kernel - the only userland upgrade that is mandatory is
modutils.

  Only FC2 ships with the 2.6 kernel, and (somebody correct me if
I'm wrong) RH 9 is far less buggy than FC2. You're better off 
sticking with RH 9.

For undergraduate level, the exams (open book) will be for 1 or 2
hours.  So the average difficuly level would be M30 (M25?), which can
be solved quite well for n number of problems with n is about 10.

for incorrect copied answer, i think getting a 'F' is fair, as he did
sin (copying).

Instead of sticking with 0 or 1 solution, just be the dynamic way "Debian" :)

  There's a list of supported chipsets on the website - but a notable
omission is the i810, which is a very common chipset that's
seen on many budget boards here. You'll probably have to look for
supported P1 boards.

  There's no impact on performance, except for boot times, which are

Hi,
I heard that STG offers a program for RHCE. Does anyone know which other computer institure offers good training for RHCE? How much would the program cost? Is it better to join some institute or read and prepare for the exam at home?
 
Thanks in advance.

If your current installation works without any hiccups, there's no reason to 
upgrade. You might have to update packages that might have security issues 
(occassionally, i.e.). 

Fedora Core 2 comes with some noticable improvements in some aspects, with 
most packages updated to their latest versions, and more polished GUI 
environment. 

But I personally still wouldn't recommend Fedora series on a 
production environment. Older versions of Redhat (7.3, for example) with 
security patches and updates seem to be more rock-solid (in terms of 
stability). If you are looking for an alternate distribution, I'd suggest 
Slackware 10 (though others might suggest you Debian Woody/Sarge, or 
Gentoo).

Chandrashekar Babu.

You can achieve this by editing your cronjob and commenting the entry that 
runs updatedb. You can manually run updatedb when you wish.

I'd suggest you the latter option (provided that you are dedicated enough to 
spend time with your computer, invest on some good books, and have
patience and capability to be self-taught).

It is also important for you to find the right "guide" or the right "tutor" 
than merely finding the right institute.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu

find / -name *.iso
or

or
updatedb & and then
locate fc3

either of the above should work.

Hi

 Tux racer game is not  working properly in MDK 10. It
is very slow and the 
cursor movements are very shaky, but it plays the
sound. It was working fine 
in MDK 9.2 in the same system.

My system is P III /40 GB/ Intel 933 mhz/ 256 mb RAM.
Multibooting Win Xp

How to solve this problem.

  Odd, but that looks like a RedHat-specific dependancy.
You either need gcc-libstdc++-2.96-??.i386.rpm or
compat-libstdc++-2.96-??.i386.rpm from RedHat. Maybe
there are corresponding compat- packages in Mandrake.

Message-ID: <413D3688.7020300@tandbintl.com>

Dear Friends,

I have proposed to go for DSL connection instead of my dial-up 
connection (which is not all working with any ISP for last 2 weeks... 
getting frustrated...! :(

Let me know how the linux supports DSL connection? is there anything to 
configure on linux side? My box is RH 8.0 with 2.6.8.1 kernel. Before 
finalising I need DSL-Linux support information, since i am targetting 
No Pirated Software/M$ in my PC by the year of 2005 (even for my family 
member).

I am living in Velachery, Chennai. Do you have any idea about which ISP 
is good (better..:))? Touchtel DSL? TATA - VSNL DSL? (I am aiming for 
good amount of downloads) Pl. guide me.

Thanks in advance
T.KaruppuSwamy

'tuxracer' requires hardware acceleration. Please check if DRI 
is enabled on your Mandrake 10's X configuration file.

PS: I assume your video card is Intel 810/815.

I think that it is already available in the kernel 2.6 by itself.

This is only using the software suspend / software suspend 2 patches 
available at the berlios.de site.

There is lots of other ACPI support in the 2.6.x kernel that makes it a 
worthwhile upgrade from 2.4.x

I'm running 2.6.8.1 and waiting for 2.6.9 to get to at least late rc 
stage ... there are a bunch of issues with rc1-bk13 at least with my 
laptop, that I dont have time to debug at the same time as I'm trying to 
do work :)

Yes madhukar! You can open the port "/dev/ttyS0" and write these 
commands, if you have connected your modem to serial port 1.  Open the 
port and read and write as usual.

yep. this feature was introduced as an experimental feature in 2.6 when 
i last saw it. you needed to select the CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND option 
while configuring. never tried it.

First shut off your caps lock key

Second - check the list archives.  Sites like 
http://eciadsl.flashtux.org have been mentioned several times on the list

Getting the actual model of the usb modem from dishnet / whoever and 
plugging that into google along with the word "linux" should help (such 
a simple thing to do, wonder why nobody seems to do it)

I used to connect using Tata Indicom WLL service till last month. I must say 
that their billing department personnel are fraudulent. A big story about 
it.

Currently, I'm using BSNL netone dialup connection (postpaid), and I find it 
good enough for checking e-mails and surfing websites though. I get speeds 
of about 4 KB/sec on average.

Yes. And as SRS mention, it is equivalent to the old UGC programs,
which is usually telecast in the afternoon.

Hi all,

I am having problems with Suse 9.1 Pro.

ls lists all files including hidden without option -a.

cp does not overwrite even with -f.

ncurses does not show color in Text mode (Ctrl Alt F1-6) but output is
colored in GUI. However command like ls give colored output even in
Text Mode.

More problems regarding mounting of Floppy and CD due to Auto mount
which i cant disable even after giving option noauto in fstab. Will
mail a copy of fstab in the nextmail.

Thanking all.

  I am seriously suggesting.. yourself, eswar/national book shop,
  net, system.

  Any thing will have a learning curve and it takes time. It needs
  practical experiance also to achive some thing.

  Tcp/ip Network administration O'Reilly (Of course you must have
  done Tannenbaum)
  Unix administartion hand book by Prentice Hall India (or Linux
  administration Hand book if you need only linux)
  and Kernighan and Pike book, Kernighan and Ritche, Perl books

  Any good training by itself will fail over a period. 
  i) Teaching is a not a good paying job in India ( look at the
     sans or any other training in US. Numbers are too much)
 ii) If training is good, lot of people with out experiance join,
     to add numbers institutes will take them. They produce more
     people with out quality.

Any knowledge in Linux administration, without practical 
experience will be hingly insufficient. The best approach,
would be to first learn some basics from books/net, and 
also function as a sys. adm. in some place, with 
LAN/NIS/NFS/Internet. If you are in a college, then the 
best place for your practical experience will be your CS Lab.

I think you are trying that ls as root. It works fine for normal
users. Anyway, this behaviour is because of the way commands are
aliased in a standard suse install.
Try 

$alias

and it will show all the command redefinitions currently active. The
system wide aliases are set in /etc/bash.bashrc  You can add your own
(and redefine) to either ~/.bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc.local

A friendly tip: always search suse's support database... it's very
likely your problem has a solution there.

It should be interesting to  hear about the plans the special invitees

address on the issues within the allotted two half hours of "moderated
open discussion".

Further, it has been reported that:

"Private companies in computer education have brought in the hardware,
software  and  the staff  to  teach the  course  framed  by the  State
Government.  Thus the schools  get the  benefit of  computer education
without the  government bearing any recurring expenditure.   This is a
model that other States are hoping to follow."

Attempts  like this  in the  US have  been rejected  as  unethical and

Thanks for your suggestion. After changing the default
depth to 16 tuxracer 
is workiking fine.

Strangely in another system PIV with  NIVIDIA RIVA

Even after changing 
default depth to 16, tux racer is not working properly
in MDK10. Any clues?

Subject: [Ilugc] How to disable colors
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0409090343100.14109@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,
In RedHat Linux(9), when I give the ls command,
the different types of files are shown in different colors.
I want all the files to be displayed in single color.

So, I have overriden /etc/DIR_COLORS with my .dir_colors(empty)
put in the home directory(I have created the file with no content).

The colors in the vi, (when I open vi, it shows in different colors.),
and other programs also I want to disable the colors.
How to do that?.(When I googled, it is showing something
related to changes in tty or stty or setterm.)

If persons, who have done that earlier tell me, that would
be easier for me.

Thanks

Hello,

To disable the syntax colors in vi.

Type ":syntax off" But this command has to be typed every time you invoke
VI.

Put it in your startup scripts

Google for it.  You can run a commandline version of seti@home on 
startup, as a daemon, I guess.

1. Write a small script to start your application. It may look 
   like this:

#!/bin/sh
# Name: start_seti.sh
# Description: Script to start SETI@Home

<do some validation here if you want>
<write the command to start SETI@Home here>
</do some validation here if you want>

#End of script

2. Make it executable

#chmod 755 start_seti.sh

3. Copy it in /etc/rc.d/init.d directory

4. Go to /etc/rc.d/rc?.d directory, where '?' is a number 
   specifying the run level you would boot in [1]

# cd /etc/rc.d/rc?.d

5. Provide a soft link to the shell script here 

#ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/start_seti.sh S99start_seti

6. do a telinit to make init re-read the config files ...
   (or reboot)

#telinit <run level>


This should start the SETI program every time you boot into
the given run level.

[1] Read the comments in /etc/inittab to know about runlevels.

1. Do, I need to have rsync on both the machines.?
2. Should one of the machine should run in daemon mode.
    (for any backup tasks)?


When I tried rsync, (rsync  version 2.5.7  protocol version 26)

mymachine:/usr/local/bin > rsync --verbose user1@x.y.com:/remote_base/directory1/all.txt /local_base

I got the following error

remshd: Login incorrect.

rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(165)

could you tell the solution or why the error occured.

Read this
http://people.fluidsignal.com/~luferbu/misc/Linus_vs_Tanenbaum.html

<extract author="ast">
Most older operating systems are monolithic, that is, the whole
operating system is a single a.out file that runs in 'kernel mode.'
This binary contains the process management, memory management, file
system and the rest. Examples of such systems are UNIX, MS-DOS, VMS,
MVS, OS/360, MULTICS, and many more.

The alternative is a microkernel-based system, in which most of the OS
runs as separate processes, mostly outside the kernel. They
communicate by message passing. The kernel's job is to handle the
message passing, interrupt handling, low-level process management, and
possibly the I/O. Examples of this design are the RC4000, Amoeba,
Chorus, Mach, and the not-yet-released Windows/NT.

Are the school syllabuses followed/proposed in Tamil Nadu published online?

Would it be possible to arrange a demo of Gnu/Linux at a State Level
Teachers' Meeting?

Computer science teachers recently protested against privatisation of 
computer education in public schools.  If the existence of free software 
is brought to light, it should provide good reasons for both avoiding 
privatisation, and to adopt free software in the schools.

Thanks,
Ramanraj.

Which version of nvidia drivers were you using ? and what was your 
motherboard+video card specs ?

I've been using for a long time on my ASUS A7V266EX motherboard (KT266 
chipset) with NVidia GeForce2 MX. It works pretty stable on my machine 
though (UT2004, Quake3 Arena, SoF work smoothly).

You might need to enable - Option "NvAGP" "1" in your XF86Config (or 
xorg.conf) for some motherboards and disable agpgart support from your 
kernel if there are occasional freeze/crash on your X server.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Easier to put it in rc.local instead of trying to figure out run level.

Going by your description, almost all modern OSes are either 'modular' or 
'microkernel'. Apparently, a 'modular' kernel can still be 
classified as a form of 'monolithic' kernel. Infact, Windows, Solaris, and 
even MS-DOS are modular kernels (if you vaguely remember, on 
MS-DOS - HIMEM.SYS, EMM386.EXE, and various other drivers/subsystems can be 
loaded using config.sys or dynamically using the devload utility). 

Speaking from a purist perspective, most OSes (atleast one's that are not 
too small) have been modular since the mid '80s. The entire kernel and all 
its subsystems within a single executable binary is a rare thing, these days 
[Of course, you can build a Linux or a FreeBSD kernel with all of its 
subsystems into a single binary, which makes it purely 'monolithic' by 
your description].

GNU/HURD, Chorus, Amoeba, Mach, L4 and Minix are good examples of 
microkernel OS. But there are commercial OSes based on microkernels too... 
like AIX, QNX, (now defunct) BeOS.

Windows NT infact, claims to be "partly" based on the microkernel 
architecture (Windows NT 3.51, AFAIK was a microkernel). Mac OSX is also 
"partly" based on microkernel architecture (most subsystems run in the user 
mode, while the I/O subsystem runs in the kernel mode, for performance 
sake).

  AIX is not a microkernel, it's monolithic, but has loadable subsystems
(similar to modules in Linux). In fact, this predates modules in Linux
by 3 or 4 years. AIX 3 (1990) has a very polished implementation of
subsystems.

  AFAIK, Minix 1.0 was monolithic, but 2.0 was a microkernel. The famous
Tanenbaum-Linus debate on Usenet occurred sometime between this transition.
(I could be mistaken on the version, but the first version of Minix that
I tried could run on a PC/XT (8088 without an MMU), so I doubt that it
was a microkernel).

  Both Windows NT and Mac OSX are derived from CMU Mach concepts, but
diverge sharply in most other respects. AFAIK, Mac OS X still has
an exposed Mach API for the microkernel, in addition to userland Apple-
specific APIs (Darwin, etc.). Windows NT never exposed the micro-
kernel API to the programmer, irrespective of whether he was a driver
developer or an application developer. The only API exposed was the
Microsoft Foundation Classes and related crapitude. But it allowed
app-level binary compatibility between Windows 95 and NT, which was a
big commercial advantage, and allowed NT to become the dominant server
OS.

  AFAIK, binary compatibility is also maintained in the upward direction
from Mac OS 9 (monolithic) and Mac OS X (Microkernel), subject to some
minor limitations.

Hi all,

I would like to know if using PEAR DB conectivity in PHP would create
any issues regarding the speed of a web site interaction as the number
of connections increase. I am designing a small college database and
would at the maximum have 250 simultaneous connections (all the
students logging in to check there results.as the system will most
probably remain off line there will be a maximum of 250 local
connecions i presume. However depending upon the feedback may have to
put it on the main portal itself (which would be gr8) ). Would like to
keep the system open to usage of both PostgreSQL. and MySQL.( Also
would try to use something new :-)

Also I have used MySQL and am now shifting to PostgreSQL. Would like
to know why it is not such a common platform with PHP. Guess speed is
1 factor. But after that i think PostgreSQL is more feature rich.

Hi,

The biggest drawback of PEAR DB is its interdependecies on multiple 
classes from within PEAR. Aaprt from this, it has very good set of classes.

Anyway, you can also use PHPLib for database abstraction.

If working with MySQL, make sure you are not using persistant 
connection. This slows down the system (MySQL).

PostgreSQL is a feature rich, heavy duty database. Its not suitable for 
small applications where you just need SELECT, INSERT & DELETE.

HTH

As of now, yes because PHP4 is not really geared up for OO.  But you can
start using it because they're planning to rewrite PEAR::DB using C/C++
which will eventually be an extension and can handle high loads IMO.

You can start using it right away because its a nice layer abstracting
the back-end so that you can switch your back-end without changing the
function calls (if you use ANSI compliant SQL).

But, seriously I don't know about the backward compatibility that
PEAR::DB would provide once it has been re-written.

Consult http://pear.php.net/.

Does it?  Without using persistent connections on really busy web sites
would eventually kill your MySQL server and bog down the system.

If u r talking about using the mysql_* or pg_*(for postgres) category
of functions then my application will become highly db specific. This
is what i want to avoid. So that i can later change the app to any db
the college requires. (Dnt know, May even get ported to IIS on Windoze
with Oracle)

PEAR DB is slow! If you want abstract database interface layer, you might 
want to try ADODB (http://phplens.com/lens/adodb/). Though, using any 
database independent layer will cause performance drop down when compared to 
access database using the DB specific API.

The last time I checked, the performance of PostgreSQL is very close to that 
of MySQL. MySQL is supposed to be light-weight than PostgreSQL, which is 
possibly one of the reasons why it was used as a backend for websites.
There's no reason for migrating to PostgreSQL unless you are using complex 
features of SQL and you find MySQL too limiting, or you are looking for an 
Object-Relational Data Model.

MySQL 4 with InnoDB support should be good enough for most website backend 
database requirements. But then again, nothing stops you from moving to 
PostgreSQL ;-)

Please tell me should i go for persistent connections or not. The web
site will get a max load of 400 concurrent connections. Also when is
there going to be a major release of PEAR updated final.

MySQL can be said to be fast, since its not as heavy as other RDBMS in 
terms of features. You can anyway google around to find out why ;)

I think Minix 1.0 should also be a microkernel (atleast from the architect's 
perspective). Of course, 8088 does not support multiple privilege levels (or 
rings). But the sources (protect.h) contain code to determine processor 
type  (8088, 286, 386, 486, so on) to make use of privilege levels if they 
are available in order to run other subsystems (net, fs, ...) on lower level 
privilege levels (TASK_PRIVILEGE or USER_PRIVILEGE).

Ofcourse, what Minix seriously lacked was virtual memory support (which was 
the primary reason for Linus to fork off his own project). I also remember 
another unofficial spin-off project by Kees J. Bot called Minix-vmd that 
implemented virtual memory support on Minix 2.0.

Anyways, the information that you provided were insightful, thanks :-)

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

MySQL drives many large web sites now and I've heard web sites running
smoothly with nearly 26 million rows and more than 500 tables.

The so-called heavy duty RDBMS will demand more licenses and machines
that SMEs can afford to.

  Thanks for the info - that's probably how it installed and ran on both
an XT and an AT. It was exceptionally fast on an 8 MHz AT, but of course
there was no paging and both code and data were limited to 64k/process.
I never delved deep into the Minix source, but I should have :-(

  The trouble was, there was no easy way to merge the patchsets (and there
were many, in addition to the VM) into Tanenbaum's codebase to get a new
and improved version. That's one of the reasons Linux took off the way
it did (in addition to the GPL).

  But I do recollect that Minix was stabler and more reliable than Linux
for a long while, probably at least until Linux-1.0.9.

True. On my 386, it was faster than MS-DOS (atleast, in copying files, and 
running small similar programs).

Yeah, for a long time, it was copyrighted by Prentice Hall with restrictive 
licenses for redistribution.

Minix is stable enough for what it is supposed to do, even today :-). The 
best part is, it can run from a DOS prompt (or even within a Windows 
command prompt window) just like any another application. This makes it all 
the more interesting (a tiny UNIX on top of M$ OS without vmware/bochs/etc).

To my knowledge, Linux wasn't _stable_ enough until it actually reached 
2.0.x (Perhaps, the network and I/O subsystems were stable though). 
Still remember mysterious hangups on Linux 1.1 and 1.2 series while running 
some heavy weight X apps (Corel WordPerfect, Wine, Enlightenment and so on). 
I had considered it as a toy/hobbyist OS back then :-).

Always use persistent connections to speed up database access. You might 
also want to use/implement some form of connection pooling and result-set 
caching to further improve the website performance and response during heavy 
load.

rsync between two machines requires a user/password authentication.
You could use " -e ssh" option to use ssh for the authentication.

eg: rsync -cvr -e ssh user1@x.y.com:/remote_base/directory1/all.txt
/local_bas ./local_bas

This would prompt for password for user1 on x.y.com host.  If you plan
to automate the rsync (which is the ideal) you have to exchange the
ssh (rsa) keys for the two machines.

check this link for a neat 'howto' to that.

http://www.cs.umd.edu/~arun/misc/ssh.html

once u configure a passwordless login (dont let this term mislead u,
its very secure), you can add the rsync in crontab.

hope this helps. 

cheers

Very  impressive site!   A lot  of effort  appears to  have  gone into
preparing  the  matriculation  school  curriculum,  and  it  is  truly
commendable  that it  has been  made available  online  requesting for
feedback to raise the standards of education.

Reading the  material on  CS reminded  me of my  days back  in school.
Those of us from CBSE schools can recall the SUPW Classes: Boys had EG
- Electrical Gadgets and  girls could opt for Sewing  - where learning
was by  doing things.  My first  EG class started  with "Properties of
Magnets", and our teacher brought a couple of bar magnets to class and
taught us  that magnets have two  poles - North and  South, like poles
repel, unlike poles attract, did  a demo with the magnets, then passed
the  magnets around  the class  letting  us try  it.  Later,  electric
bulbs, batteries, transformers,  resistors and capacitors entered into
the class: but all these were  referred to only by their generic names
and we  were taught  about their general  properties. Brand  or vendor
names were used only to compare market prices, quality and suitability
for use.  [BTW, SUPW is short for Socially Useful Productive Work]

I wish that the whole school curriculum is based and built around SUPW

Computer  Science is  fairly mature,  qualifies as  a  good vocational
subject, and has evolved  standards and specifications that are vendor
neutral.   Lessons  taught  under  Computer Science  should  be  given
general   titles    like   word-processing,   spreadsheets,   database
management, operating systems,  file management, programming etc.  The
matriculation  syllabus  needs  corrections,  and should  use  subject
headings  like "Database  Systems" instead  of "Microsoft  Access", or
"Word Processing" instead of "Microsoft Word".

Could  Mr. Thiagarajan please  share his  memorandum/suggestions here?
Probably, based on input from members of this list, we could also send
feedback as  requested by the Director of  Matriculation Schools, even
though we have crossed the due date, as the proposed syllabus is to be
introduced  only in  stages from  2005, so  that the  Computer Science
subject could be truly and honestly taught as a SCIENCE.

-Ramanraj.

If you changed the DNS server's IPs it may take time for the DNS to 
propogate (anywhere up to 48 hours)

Especially as both nameservers are within your domain.

Anyway I am able to resolve your MX records - so yahoo should be able to 
  do this too - if not now at least a few hours later.

Oh wait, I'm an idiot

You have pointed amiindia.co.in's MX to venus.amiindia.co.in

;; ANSWER SECTION:
amiindia.co.in.         23h57m18s IN MX  10 venus.amiindia.co.in.

Problem is there is no A record for venus.amiindia.co.in pointing to the 
IP for your mailserver

So set an A record up -

venus.amiindia.co.in.		IN	A	your.ip.add.ress

Update the serial number of the zone for amiindia.co.in and then reload 
ndc to update your nameservers.

Good question. I have been asked in examinations: is
law/economics/mathematics an art or science, and usually dithering
either way somehow points to the "correct" answer ;)

But, teaching Microsoft Access/Word to school children certainly cannot
be called science.

Proof(?):

<quote from a post to India-egov mailing list>
Open MS Word and type

=rand (200,99)

and hit ENTER.
</quote>

Someone in that list reported to have seen an endless loop of
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." after that.

The joke appears to be on people too lazy to take free software seriously :)

I have no doubt that _computer programming_ is an art.

But, many articles like Free Software/Free Science argue well:

Should I use MySQL  or PostgreSQL?

Well then Yahoo uses MySQL.  I dont see any reason why
you should go for PostgreSQL.

Should I use PEAR DB Connectivity?

Well if you want maximum performance then don't.  If you want
to switch over to some other database i.e PostgreSQL in future then
go with Abstraction Layers.  Its the compromise you have to make
between speed and maintainability.

Dear Ramnraj and Bharathi
Greetings !
Thank you for care on school education. 
The Matric. syllabus is discussed in a systematic way,
last week group of teachers had a seminor at CBE under Pro. Gnanam and
discussed the issues.
At present Our Educaiton system is based on Marks
you have to score the maximum possible marks.
it is because, we are unable to come to a common understanding on the 
Evaluvation system. Whether it is Objective Type Questions, or Descriptive 
Type or Continuous internal assesment or Practical Exams.
More over, we have to test on all the above to have a better understanding   
about student.

well, The text book should be prepared in a manner that it will help the 
students to understand the subject.
Teacher training is another aspec

Recently the 11th std, books are revised and published. we had the same level 
of discussions , we got the books late, students changedthe group because of 
the size of the book.

i have introduced StarOffice in 6th and 7th , but it has become a failure, 
because the students are unable to practise at home. 

As you mentioned, we have to introduce the Conepts like, WordProcessing, 
SpreadSheet, Database, web browser rather than brand name.  But because of 
the examination presser, the students forget. [ most of the Matric. schools, 
did not allow the students to learn, but they have to complete the portion ]


here are some of the positive impacts of the new syllabus.

1) Tamil Computing, 
2) latest topics like call centers, atm , VoIP,etc
3) Linux file system.
4) Internet related applications

here are some of the realities.

1)The salay of the Computer Teachers are very low [ around 2000 /- ] , that 
leads to lack of motivation.
2) the computer teachers are forced to do school office clerical work [ in the 
name of computerization ] to get a better certificate from the HM
3) Some or not qualified teachers
4) Many did not under go Bacheler of education, so they did not understand the 
students psycology.
5) The management may not support to upgrade the hardware and software.
[ many teachers did not know how to write in CD and how to configure email 
client or internet connections ]
6) the teachers are not encouraged to update [ permission will be denied to 
study further ]
7)Most of the computer teachers are still thinking that oneday they will join 
in a multinational company

i have few more realities, which i can not share in a public list like this.

in matriculation shcools, the conditions are far better. many ofthe  above 
points are void. but you have to add another point "ego"

more in next
thiagu

note: since this discussion is restricted to very few, we can have one-to one 
discussions, rather then mailing to the list.

Just allow the students to bring their books to the examination hall. 
That should solve all problems regarding educational system. :)

But what is more confusing is this :along with the error message, I
was suggested to look into the 'root=' option in lilo.conf.

my lilo.conf:
------------------------------------------
prompt
boot=/dev/hda3
default=Linux
delay=40
root=/dev/hda3
install=/boot/boot.b
map=/boot/map
image=/vmlinuz.old
	label=Linux
	initrd=/initrd.old
image=/vmlinuz
	label=Linux2.6.8
--------------------------------------------

When I looked into this I was surprised!!! Because here is my fstab

--------------------------------------------
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
/dev/hda2	/	ext3	defaults,errors=remount-ro	0 1
/dev/fd0	/floppy	auto	rw,user,noauto	0 0
/dev/hdc	/cdrom	auto	ro,user,noauto	0 0
proc	/proc	proc	defaults	0 0
--------------------------------------------
where hda2 is mounted as root. But in my lilo.conf it is different.
When I changed it to hda2 in lilo.conf, I got kernel panic for both
the kernels.

Am I missing something here???

Hmm... One of my friend is working in VSNL. We once tried to install the USB

Subject: [Ilugc] Ilugc Website - wiki?
Message-ID: <8816fcf80409120609718432b@mail.gmail.com>

I suggest using a wiki [1] in place of our existing website.  The advatages - 

1. No need to worry about administration
2. Anyone (at-least can restrict to ilugcians) can edit it
3. Anyone can put content into it.
4. Imagine the 'CDs for sale' page keep growing as users keep adding
the info. about the CDs they have
5. No centralized adminstration.  A set of people can become the SysOp
and monitor the changes
6. Just use the RSS of 'Recent Changes' for monitoring changes, you
(admin) don't need to visit the 'Recent changes' page daily to find
culprits.

I guess it make sense for us to use the wiki.  We don't need to ask
the list 'whether anyone is taking over the job of maintaining
website'. The point is everyone maintains the website (in their free
time) and the wiki helps them to do so, without much frills.

Please give me access to www.chennailug.org server, I will
install/configure mediawiki and let you all know.

See www.gentoo-wiki.com for an example. *We* can also put technical
articles, FAQs and virtually any kind of document in it

he's talking about their usb modem product and that has no official

do have third party drivers available, for which you just have to check

That's what I did guess.  So people, please don't post anything
related to gmail invites in ths list.  If you care visit
http://www.gmailtrader.com/

PS: If you have no one to offer gmail invite, just keep it with you. 
Let them ask you rather than you giving the invites.

yes. But it has some advantages too(like nat).
As the orig poster is going use it in home, modem will be a better choice.

He doesn't want to use M$ :-) please see his first post. But without driver
how can he install the modem in linux. So he has to first download the
driver using M$(at his home) and then config it in linux.

i see the only way he can connect to internet without M$ windows help is
router. Also he can remove windows once modem works in linux.

oh you mean "install the router plan first, paying 2 or 3 times the amt 
of money for a usb modem, then download the linux usb routers, then 
contact dishnet / touchtel, cancel the router account and get a new usb 
account"?

so all he has to do is to go to a cybercafe or somewhere and d/l the 
linux drivers for the model of his usb modem, bring it home burnt onto a 
CD or floppy.

i didn't mean that. i said he has choice. IIRC, he already has windows in
his home. he can download the linux driver from there and

Also he can remove windows once modem works in linux.

Hi Mohan Raj,

                   Did you get a VFS mount error or a Kernel panic
(the interrupt OOPS).Fill in your screen dump. Well i got mine working
with a nonintrd (with grub on a RH FC2 Distro) on a Via Epia M board,
Well my .config would be for a 2.6.7 kernel with a epia patch , will
try a 2.6.8 soon on i386,

Cheers

When I run this program, Recursive Function R(),

Called only 523714 times, after that segmentation fault occurs WHY?

void R()
{
    static int i =0;
    i++;
    printf("%d\n",i);

    R();
}

int main()
{
    R();
}

What is the problem here?

For any recursive function, you should have an exit criteria. Otherwise 
it would recurse forever. Your function doesn't have an exit point.

Since you don't have an exit point, repeated call of the function by itself 
leads to stack overflow.

HTH.

Probably you're out of memory (call stack)!
Any good recursive function should exit at some point in time say for
example:

void R()
{
	/* ... */
	if (i > 1000) return;
	/* ... */
}

HTH.

 As people rightly  pointed out it must be stack overflow.

But tell me an recursive function shld run forever(atleast in theory) right
??? 


Consider a case where my program does something repeatedly ..in such a case
I write a recursive program .what's the point in writing a recursive
function if it is going to exit abruptly.

Now the question arises how to clear this stack etc etc ????

For any recursive function, you should have an exit criteria. Otherwise it
would recurse forever. Your function doesn't have an exit point.

Since you don't have an exit point, repeated call of the function by itself
leads to stack overflow.

Guess you're confused between recursive functions and daemon
programs/services.

Now whats your question? ;-)

If you want to do something repeatedly, your program should have been...

void R()
{
    static int i =0;
    i++;
    printf("%d\n",i); 
}

int main()
{
  while(1)
    R();
}

This is what a daemon is.

use a while loop.
like:
while(0)
{
	blah...

or a for(;;)

Message-ID: <20040913043332.19547.qmail@web52503.mail.yahoo.com>

==>I'm curious to hear if anybody has tried out a
64-bit x86-64 install of
any standard distro, and what their experiences
were.<==



Dual opteron planar boards available
from Tyan, Iwill, MSI and Rioworks 
are Extended ATX form factor (12"x13").
All of these boards require EPS12v
powersupply of min. 470w, preferred 550w.
They must have 24/8 power connectors
not the usual 20/4 power connectors.
In addition, thermal requirements 
require proper ventillation to keep 'em
running for a longtime.  All these
means you need to shop for the proper
system case and pretty good ceramic fans.

Now, the memory needs to be buffered, ecc
atleast ddr 2100.  'buffered, ecc' is a
requirement for Tyan board to boot everytime.
No cheap memories, choice is Micron, Samsung
and Kingston.  You can get 12gb to 32gb
depending on the planar board.  There are
several variations of planar boards.
Mostly, variations are in PCI-X bus 100 or 133, how
many, onboard Ultra Scsi or Sata etc.  Most come
with USB (most support 1.1 not 2.0)
Most planar boards comes with gigabit 
network interface(s), IDE & Floppy.

Now, that said here is a breakdown of 
discounted web prices from reliable vendors.
Planar $430, CPU 240 ($175 ea), Cooler ($30 ea),
EPS12v power ($100), 1gb ecc. reg memory ($240 ea)
EATX case ($120). So, dual opteron BYOS cost well
over $1500.

Now, having tested Tyan, Iwill & MSI, our preference
for our own warped reasons is MSI or Iwill. 
MSI was the reference board at AMD with long
visibility.
SCSI, SATA are pci board options.  Qlogic 2200 FC HBA
works on all planar boards we tested. We prefer this
to 
on-board for various reasons, a simple one
the onboard SATA doesn't support raid 5.

We have tested Fedora Core 2, Suse 9.1 Pro,
RedHat AS 3, and in the pipe SUSE SLES 9.
Fedora had no problem finding itself and
doing the right thing.
So are the Suse 9.1 and RedHat AS.

Where is the beef ? Almost, all versions 
had problems greater than 6gig configuration.
It works most of the time on RedHat and Suse.
We suspect it is more of a hardware problem.
Our initial deployment of 20 something
systems will have only 4Gig. So, to keep our sanity
we are not banging our head against barriers!
These systems will replace ibm pseries 660, 640
smp systems and AIX5.1L. In phase 1 we are
deploying some of these boxes to support >800 users
in a HA SAMBA/SAN environment and the other Oracle
custom apps.

To be fair, IBM brought some Boca boys and Austin
aunts, with their iSeries boxes.  We were blown away
by the Linux performance and price/performance value
of ibm's iseries boxes.

Now, we are scratching our head about phase 2. 
The iseries boxes benefits greatly from
the new power chip and its large cache in steps and
custom memory & bus management architecture. To add
to the 'value' computation ibm's support of system
and in SAN environment. 

Dual Opteron with SuSE/RH enterprise server software
is a good deal for startups, research institutes etc.,

In closing, it is not wise to compromise on
power-supply, cooler and memory.  They are part of the
equation for reliablity.  

Cheers,
Rudy

Perhaps you are trying to use a structured programming language to implemented a functional programming paradigm. If you are inclined towards writing programs using intoxicating amounts of recursion, you must either be writing them using haskell or LISP. But then, they too have their limitations. Any recursive block must end at some point either by a condition-check, or run till your system bails out of memory (or stack-space, precisely).

If your task is to run a function repeatedly forever, you must redesign the function using iterative constructs (using while(), for(), do() or *gasp* goto, in C).

What has daemons got to do with recursive/iterative constructs ? For all I know, this code isn't designed to run in the background on its own, it doesn't detached from the controlling terminal, and it also doesn't have any form of event-loop mechanism (which I believe are minimal requirements for calling a program a daemon).

Hi,
     The program design is wrong.     Anyway if you the reason for your 
program termination.
Normally the maximum stack size for the program is 8 MB.

     You can get this by

        #include<sys/resource.h>
       #define MB 1024*1024
       main()
        {
        struct rlimit rm;
        getrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK,&rm);
        printf("\nSTACK SIZE: MAX=%d MB CURR=%d\n", 
rm.rlim_max/(MB),rm.rlim_cur/(MB));
       }

   If you want you program want to run some more time use setrlimit... It's 
advisable that the maximum stack limit must be 16 MB less than physical 
memory.


For writing daemon process make use of the library function daemon(int,int); 
( #include <unistd.h>)

Hope this will help you.

Regards,
-lok.

Hi 

   I ran this program 

void R()
{
    static int i =0;
    i++;
  /*  printf("%d\n",i);*/

    R();
}

int main()
{
    R();
}

in my Home ...the same program which was sent earlier.

This program is still running well above 12 hrs (running since last night
till I left for office this morning  ) ... My machine is a P2 /64 MB ram. 

I am sure it would have run more than 52K times ...Any clues what's
happening here ??? No segmentation fault nothing .
Don't exactly remember gcc version..

Nothing specific ..neither do I want to write a daemon program now.

The whole issue started since someone mentioned that his recursive program
was stopping after sometime (after 52K iterations). The solution  given was
stack overflow.

I ran the same program and it seems to be running well over 12 hr...That's
why I asked how come the difference.

If its stack overflow....why is it not overflowing in my machine ??? (p2 64
MB RAM). I just complied as it is(gcc -o test test.c)

Kannan

My question is why would you want to write such a program which does an
infinite recursive looping.

If your intention is to write a daemon program, it is much more complex
-- you need to detach from the terminal and ignore certain signals, etc.
You can get the skeleton daemon program either from Advanced UNIX
Programming Environment or by digging the web.

Stack overflow is no exception to any machine. You should be 
missing something out.

The earlier version of the program would have atleast run for some time, but 
yours (without printf) would have seg faulted immediately.

The reason is the there is no console operation (printf). So, the code will reach 
the stack overflow condition in a second or two while the one with printf will 
take some time to reach the same condition. 

I am sure that you are missing out something if it runs for more than 12 hours 
(Impossible) no matter your have 64MB or 64GB of memory. Cross check your 
sources.

Thanks a lot friends for you overwhelmed support on this issue.
Sorry friends, I was busy with other activities and Touchtel DSL 
installation.... so i was not able to post reply immediately. DSL 
installation is over yesterday. It is working fine with M$. In Linux i 
got the id of USB modem through dmesg.

It is not eciadsl supported modem :( :(.
But It is a connexant chip modem (i don't know the chip number....).
Model is Aethra StarModem 0572/cb06
For connexant chipset modems there are two options of driver we can try.
1. AccessRunner driver
2. Olitec driver

I have downloaded Olitec driver (thro' standby M$) and started 
making.... it is giving some error... yet to continue today night... 
hope I will do it and make a nice document of how-to so that other 
touchtel users also will be benefitted. (btw, i spoke to Tochtel people, 
soon they are coming with linux official support! )

Regards,
T.KaruppuSwamy

Please don't believe TC for segmentation faults. It is not reliable in
segmentation faults area. Try this code:
#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
	int *ptr = (int*)0;

	if(*ptr = 5)
	{
		printf("It worked");
	}
}

	To the best of my knowledge it works more times than not.

	I think that is because DOS gives the whole of the avaibale
memory for the program under execution.

	Also, the best that can be expected is that TC will get closed
in such cases.

If its if(*ptr = 5) then any version shld allow this ???

If its if(*ptr == 5) then TC is also not allowing ...

It is (*ptr = 5). The idea is to show that it is succeeding.

A guideline to avoid spam is not to mention the exact e-mail address 
directly on the mails that are going to be archived on the web. Since 
this mail is going to be archived on the web, some spider crawling 
through the web can parse this address and add it to the list of 
valid e-mail addresses. Use some cryptic form like thrayil AT gmail DOT com 
instead.

	Anna University (screening tomorrow!!)
Message-ID: <8816fcf8040914005225ca32cb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

As part of the ACM Student Chapter, CEG we are planning to screen
"Revolution OS" in CEG, Anna University.

We are 80% sure of this.  I will send the confirmation mail today.

The screening is planned on Wednesday (tomorrow) at

Seminar Hall (2nd floor),
Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering,
CEG,
Anna University.

Our main concern is in getting a system with DVD player and preferably
with Linux installed.  We have one guy here willing to give his
system, he will bring that tomorrow, then we have to check whether his
DVD player is working on Linux .. lot of work and less feasible. 
Meanwhile, if anyone is interested in giving his laptop please mail me
today.

I am also looking for posters. Please send them today itself.

I also want a rough estimate of how many people from ilugc will attend the show.

Pass this to all.

(Typed in urgency.. so mroe typos, bye)

more info .. in my next mail

But a lot other don't do it by deafult. Why should you rely on 
someone else for protecting your mailbox? A search for 'suraj@symonds.net'
gave 191 hits in goole (similar pages excluded). 90% of them 
would be mailing list. So, what is the problem in avoiding such 
practise when sending mail to public mailing lists? You 
are not going to lose anything.

Not as easily as if it is in plain format.

Hi everyone,

Is there anyone on this? I have been trying for over 24 hours now
without success. BTW Is my way of putting things wrong or there are
n't many who faced this problem?

I think many of you would be on 2.6 by now.
How to do a mkinitrd on a 2.6. I guess there is some diff. So I
updated both mkinitrd and the tools package and did:

mkinitrd -o initrd <kernel version>

and I am given an initrd of about 3MB in size. What the??
anyway included the initrd in my grub.conf (switched from lilo) . but
when booting got the messg:
==========================================
ERROR: Module <modulename.o> not found in /proc/modules
.............................
ERROR: Module <modulename.o> not found in /proc/modules
ERROR: Module <modulename.o> not found in /proc/modules

VFS: Error Cannot open dev/console
==========================================
and booting stops.

I read something about /proc being replaced with sysfs. So I have that
entry too in my fstab. What should I do?

I have been googling and googling and ....
Please help.

Mohan

It'll create /boot/initrd.gz which you'd pass to grub / lilo as initrd

Best bet would be to get a .config for a 2.6 debian kernel and use that as a
base for make menuconfig

Tomorrow (wednesday) at 4 pm, we are going to screen Revolution OS (1
1/2 hours movie).  The only problem we have is no pre-plan.   We
haven't done any testing of the DVD show in the system.  One guy here
will bring his desktop computer (not laptop) tomorrow, with DVD drive
.. he says his DVD drive was not recognized in Win98.  Possibly
tomorrow I will try to install Linux/xine and try some hand on it ..
please mail me any suggestions you have.

If anyone is willing to provide a system, please contact me.  

Shiv, I think you have a dedicated DVD box .. can u help us?

All are welcome for the show.

Your gmail id would have already been aggregated from

So, no pain of decoding it from there ;-)

My new laptop runs slackware 10 and the dvd drive seems to work quite well

Only problem is that the sound on this laptop SUCKS.

I have an older compaq laptop that has much better speakers and a dvd 
drive .. only, it runs winxp :)

thanks for replying.

but mkinitrd errors; there is no option -c and -k is 'Keep temporary
directory used to make the image'

I apt-get ed mkinitrd only a few hours ago. Is my mkinitrd screwed up ...

What is the exact problem with sound in former.  Windows is only the
last possible option.  Linux laptops with DVD drive are welcome.

  I have a fully-configured box with DVD drive and Xine. You'll
need an audio amp with RCA input jacks (L & R), and a projector
with VGA input capable of 48 kHz hsync (most projectors can handle
this). Also keep a PS/2 KB & mouse handy.

  The only issue is that playback was somewhat jerky last time
(slow CPU). I'll try to fix it today with a 2.6 kernel - if it
doesn't work any better, you'll have to put up with the frame
drops.

  As an alternative, I have a notebook with DVD drive that works
fine with PowerDVD on Windows ME (blasphemy!).

  If there's any interest, send me a note to work out the logistics
to get to AU tomorrow. I'll probably need to set it up at least
90 minutes in advance, to check if it works. How do I get to the
CS dept., and is there parking available?

Thanks, but will your laptop run Linux?

See

just come to AU and ask anyone there about Computer Science department
and come to second floor.  We will be there in the seminar hall.

  I have a cable, that plugs into a PC audio card, and has two RCA plugs
(red & white) for connecting to any standard HiFi audio amp with line-in
RCA sockets. So I asked if your amp has those sockets - they're usually
a pair, one white and one red.

  OK, how was the receiver for the cordless mike connected to the amplifier?
There had to have been some kind of input socket on the amp.

  The notebook has exactly the same issue, but it has very small built-in
speakers.

  Can you arrange for a pair of amplified speakers - the standard plastic
LabTec or Logitech ones will do OK, though they're not HiFi.

good to hear that windows is the last option. but IMHO it would be
better if nothing else is an option except linux. cause i know how
ridiculous it felt when i had the chance to see a couple of linux
presentations in windows laptops.

nobody should think 'you show a 90min movie regarding linux. but why
is n't it worth running a simple dvd yet'

cheers for your initiatives. wishing that everything turns out well.

The problem is only quite a few are runing Linux on machines with DVD 
drives and *CLEARLY* not that Linux can't play DVDs.

I am watching quite a lot of DVDs in my weekend on my Linux machine only.
I had a DVD writer too.

I can spare my desktop PC if no other Linux machines are available 
to screen the Movie. Powered by Debian Sarge.

I had similar problems while upgrading to 2.6.7.I had the mkinitrd
correct.Check during configuration of kernel if the IDE disk driver
support is built into the kernel rather than as module.I did this and
it started working.

Hi,

Just migrated to Mandrake 10. Had been using Xandros OCE until now.
One question: Does'nt urpmi support installing new packages from the
net along with the dependencies? I used to like the 'apt' provided
with debian (and Xandros) and was quite convenient to look for new
packages and install then without any problems.

Compiler optimisation is at work here.

Lookup "tail recursion elimination" in GCC docs or your favourite
compilers book.

IIRC, GCC can also to "tail call elimination".  Both of which can
eliminate the recursive function call and effectively turn it into a
loop.

Try compiling without optimisation using the -O0 gcc flag and observe the
results.  To see what exactly happens when you optimise, try gcc -S,
which will provide you the asm code.

AFAIK, when gcc is called with *no* command line options, *no*
optimization will be done.

While this is usually the case, it need not always be true.
GCC's default options are listed in the 'specs' file.

The OP did not mention the gcc flags used, and we can only speculate.

I just found out that gcc-2.95 does not know how to optimize tail calls.
However gcc-3.3.4 -foptimize-sibling-calls option completely eliminates
the recursive call.  Look at the C code and associated asm -

void foo(void) {
    static int i;
    i++;
    foo();
}


gcc -S test.s produces the following -

foo:
    pushl   %ebp
    movl    %esp, %ebp
    incl    i.0
    call    foo             <=== Function call!
    popl    %ebp
    ret


gcc -foptimize-sibling-calls -S test.c generates the following asm.

foo:
    pushl   %ebp
    movl    %esp, %ebp
.L3:
    incl    i.0
    jmp     .L3                 <=== Just a jump to L3

Note that this has eliminated tail recursion, and not just the sibling
call.  Good stuff.

Wow ..This is something new. infact the whole argument is centered on
weather a recursive program will run forever or not.

Initially I had a belief that a recursive program will run forever. After
all these discussions I reconciled recursion is dependent on stack memory.

There were strong objections when I mentioned it was running well past 12
hrs. Whatever you have mentioned is quite contrary from rest of the post.

Can you pls elaborate.

A recursive program runs as long as there is space in the stack.

It the recursion has been eliminated, maybe using "tail recursion
elimination", the generated executable is not recursive, and so runs
forever.

Please try this program and see what happens.

int R()
{
	static int i = 0;
	R();
	i++;
}

int main()
{
	R();
	return 0;
}

A recursive program without a base case will run forever.  It's just the
same as an infinite for/while/goto loop.  No big deal.

In C, each function call uses some stack space to store the return
address and local variables.  Therefore recursion will cause stack
growth (explosion rather) and terminate your process when stack space
is exhausted.

If you are careful, you can do recursion without growing your stack.
Then you can recurse forever.  Functional programming languages like
haskel, prolog, mercury have been good at this game for many years.

Note that you cannot eliminate *all* recursive calls.  You can only
eliminate recursive calls under special conditions,
eg.  tail recursion - recursive call is last statement in your function.

Compilers: Principles Techniques and Tools (aka Dragon Book) has a lot
of stuff for an ardent reader.

of course..
pretty much everybody in this list knows that.
but we can't expect it out of the audience.
my point is that ... it only adds to the strength of the movie (in a
subtle way) if it is played in linux.

i think we should stop this here. please dont take this topic further
on. please.

  Whether a program will run forever or not has nothing to do with 
recursion. Recursion is merely a mechanism that allows a function
(subroutine) to call itself. 

> Initially I had a belief that a recursive program will run forever. After
> all these discussions I reconciled recursion is dependent on stack memory.
> 
  I don't believe you've understood anything from the discussion. A program
that uses a recursive function call may or may not run forever - it has
nothing to do with recursion. 

  Likewise, the size of the stack has nothing to do with how long a recursive
program will run. There are recursive functions that use very little stack,
but have a running-time complexity that grows exponentially with the input
argument. An example would be depth-first minimax search of any
reasonable game tree, including Chess or Reversi. The search will take
longer than the age of the universe, although the maximum game tree size
in chess is strictly bounded in height (it's no more than about 4000 deep,
probably even less when considering the 40-move endgame limit). It's
possible to write a recursive chess program that can exactly solve any
position, without running out of stack space; but it may take longer
than the age of the universe to run. 

> There were strong objections when I mentioned it was running well past 12
> hrs.

  You compiled it on a crappy real-mode DOS compiler that does not even
have memory protection or stack limits tests, and you actually believe
that your program was still running correctly without having completely
overwritten memory after the first few milliseconds? The strong objections
were more to do with the fact that you had no idea what you were doing.

> Whatever you have mentioned is quite contrary from rest of the post.
> Can you pls elaborate. 

  Raja was talking about tail-recursion elimination optimization in gcc,
and it's a special case where compilers can replace a recursive call
with a simple jump. There isn't any contradiction there - the asm code
shows the optimization quite clearly.

  What you need to do is read some introductory book on programming,
before filling this list with some more mindless blather.

  My grain of salt:
  Is it rpm install? Configuration file will ge available in
  /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

   What is the community name? What parameters you edited?
   You can create configuration by running snmpconf.
   RPM install may not host Host resources mib. It is better
   to comile source tar.

Are you  sure telnet service is enabled and running?

Look at /etc/xinetd.d/telnet  file and see that disable=no.

If not modify and restart xinetd services.

  You can enable telnet, but it could be better you can use ssh.
  If you enable ssh, it has the following features
 
  i) All the traffic is encrypted (means if any one has root or admin 
passwords on their desktop and you don't have switch, but hubs only
  password sniffing is easy.

 ii) You can use for remote shell and copy

 iii) It scales well. If you connect later to internet, you have good
  habits of using ssh rather than telnet.

  You need to use putty or ssh secureshell from RSA labs or winscp, 
sshterm etc on your windows to connect ssh.

This error shows that you have not enabled telnet service .
go to /etc/xinet.d/ (or) run setup to enable the telnet (or) ssh what 
ever you want...

I faced the same problem with the VCDs. It was an original 
MATRIX-I VCD. I couldn't copy the .DAT files to my harddisk.
Gave I/O error on RedHat 9.0. However, the copying suceeded 
when i tried it from Windows 2k (dual-booted in the same 
machine)

In RedHat, on doing an ls -l, it showed correct file size
and permissions.

any solutions ?

You have to specify the community string  and  give it permissions,so
that it can be wread from some host.

  VCDs often have lots of fake tracks as an anti-piracy measure. You
can duplicate them with cdrdao, but I don't think there's a general

You can do a mplayer -dumpstream vcd://<track> 

And can then play the dumpfile.

Also, you can copy the CD with readcd or cdrecord and the file will 
directly play with mplayer.

Message-ID: <20040916022842.62ABA32C85@whitebox.dias.ath.cx>


  Just a few notes about the movie screening:

1) The venue was excellent - a spacious seminar hall with AV facility (this
could be a rough model for the kind of place to screen content in the
future. The turnout was pretty good, with an initial audience of about 100.
(About half the crowd left midway when we had media problems).

2) It helps to setup and test the equipment before the screening, including
a full run of the movie to check for media problems. In the event, the
Toshiba projector, the Xine source and the speakers worked better than
expected. However, the media problems in the second half of the movie
were unanticipated.

3) A break in the beginning/middle with a question-answer session would
also be useful. It so happened that we got that break accidentally when the
power went out :-). The question-answer session at the end, although
effective, did not have the full audience strength.

4) We need to replicate this experiment and repeat it at other venues after
sorting out the media problems. It helps to have backup media and/or

5) It might be a good idea to have some ILUGC-related collateral to hand
out at the end (just a general printout with URLs, contacts, etc.), at least
in ILUGC-organized shows. We can also have standardized posters for The Code,
Revolution OS, ... that can be mailed out along with the invite to future
shows.

Sridhar & Vasudevan from the LUG regulars were present - others who showed
up at the demo day were also present. 

Further comments, suggestions, flames, etc. welcome.

  It's no longer an issue. There's enough memory on today's
cards to support 32-bit depth at full resolution. The limitation
is in the monitor (CRT or LCD). The rule I follow is to use the
highest resolution I can comfortably see on my monitor with
minimal eye-strain. These are (on IBM CRT monitors, all at 16-bit
depth):

15": 800x600
17": 1024x768
19": 1280x1024
21": 1440x1080

The monitors can display much higher resolutions, but I don't use them. With
anti-aliased fonts, you can probably go one step higher without increased
eye-strain - YMMV.

My advice is to use virtual desktops or Xinerama if you want more display area,
rather than higher resolutions.

It was not the media problem.  Muthu was able to play the movie in

Yes, in fact this decision was quick -- we decided on Tuesday
afternoon, and made the posters quickly in another hour .. posted it
in most of the class rooms.

Last week we saw the full movie in Power DVD/Windows in hostel.  So I
though that's a good enough testing.

Message-ID: <20040916040812.16B7D32C85@whitebox.dias.ath.cx>


   Just a summary of my Xine configuration (it's by no
means the only recipe for good results) on an Intel i815, Celeron 533
(8 x 66), 128 MB PC66 RAM, onboard graphics (should also work for the
ubiquitous i810 chipsets): 

1. Linux 2.6.8.1 with Deadline I/O scheduler (disable anticipatory,
CFQ, etc.)

2. ALSA compiled in, with OSS emulation. Disable OSS.

3. RedHat 7.3/9 distro w/ XFree86 4.2 or 4.3 w/ Xv extension (stock).

4. libdvdcss-1.2.8 (optional, only required for encrypted DVDs).

5. libdvdread-0.9.4 (from the ogle project)

6. Xine 0.9.13 (compiled with OSS and Xv support, built for i686-gnu-linux
   target).

7. dvdnav support with libdvdnav and xine-dvdnav.

8. Enable DMA and 32-bit I/O on the DVD drive with hdparm.

With this, I get the full 24/25 fps at 800x600 fullscreen with no audio dropouts
and perfect A/V sync on commercial DVDs without media faults (scratches, etc.).
There may be enough performance headroom to drop the CPU speed to 400/433
or increase the resolution to 1024x768 (both need to be tested).

TODO:

1. Alternative audio path (untested) using native ALSA with alsa-lib and Xine
built with ALSA support. 

2. Dolby 5.1 with AC3-to-SPDIF path on supported cards.

Comments invited from anybody who has experimented with similar or other
options.

  OK, I think I can rule out a Xine problem, because it played the 2nd
DVD without problems, and also other commercial pressed DVDs. So it must
have been the Hitachi GD-2500 DVD drive (it's now almost 6 years old)
- Mea culpa.

Well, it depends on your monitor, if you have a 15" monitor, 1024x768
would be more than sufficient, and using a high quality display
definitely uses more memory.

The rule of the thumb is, it shouldn't be too much of a strain on your
eyes.

Configuring your monitor incorrectly might sometimes burn it, read the
manual accompanied for the horizontal sync and vertical refresh values.

The best possible way to configure XFree86 is by running XFree86
-configure, and then adjusting the parameters to suit your needs.

>From what I know, most commodity 15" monitors (Samsung/LG/Daewoo and the
likes) can display 1024x768 resolution at 60Hz vertical refresh rate.
This refresh rate can cause eye-strain, fatigue and headache. 800x600 is
safest to use on these monitors. On a commodity 17" monitors however,
resolutions upto 1152x864 (at 75 Hz) seems safer to the eyes.

your mistake is installing it on an antique system like debian stable

firefox needs gtk2 and xft - which needs a rather newer version of gnome

when the latest stable mozilla is 1.7?  still ancient.

you upgraded your entire gnome install, and upgraded mozilla, before 
firefox got installed.

just 80 megs for that seems to be a rather minimal download.

Several brands of CD-R are  available in the market
and the price ranges 
from Rs.5 to Rs.15. Some users would have better

the products available in the market. I need

brand is the best cost and quality wise. I used a

  I don't think the coasters are related to the CDR
brand - it's more likely to be a drive or buffer-underrun
issue. Also test your system memory.

  Anyway, I've had good results with Samsung, Imation,
TDK & Pioneer (old green/gold 12x). Moser-Baer has also
been recommended.

using 'testing'  and seeing a 'refreshing  look' on your  gnome is far

Dude, for mozilla, 1.7 *is* stable.  I think the bleeding edge version is 
1.9.x something.

Firefox is still at 0.9.3 stable based on 1.7.x mozilla, and version 1 
prerelease for both branch (1.7 mozilla tree) and trunk (bleeding edge 
mozilla 1.9.x)

My bad words are reserved for debian, not for ancient / antique etc :)

6 out of 100 is more or less par for the course ...

You might try mitsubishi / sony etc rather than no-name taiwanese brands

Though to be fair most of the taiwanese brands are actually the same 
companies that a lot of the big name cd manufacturers outsource their cd 
blanks production to.

'testing' version a year back (when i had a true broadband) and never
had the resources again to update.

i have read this disclaimer. i know that apt-get is mature enough to
handle such situations. so please.. please.. stop treating me like a
baby.

i donno what lead you to that conclusion. apt-get is one of the best
things i have come across in the softrware world. did you notice the
subject ? it is not 'apt-get error' or 'apt-get bug'. i am just trying
to find if this is abnormal and if it is, what could have caused it.

         cdrdao read-cd --device=/dev/hdc --datafile mymovie.bin
         mplayer mymovie.bin will play the file.

Thanks. This worked:

$ mplayer -dumpstream -dumpfile /tmp/movie.dat vcd://

mplayer can directly play from the VCD:

  I haven't tried Mandrake 10 or Suse 9.1, but I'd guess that the
bloat would be too much for my poor old Celeron 533 with 128 MB of RAM
(which however handles RedHat 7.3 fine).

well, i could play them very well from harddisk. after copying through

The problem was copying the data from CD to harddisk thru linux. cp gave me

Subject: [Ilugc] Debian mount point any diff from other distro ?
Message-ID: <3779a1e704091602471486b49@mail.gmail.com>

Is there any diff in the way debian labels partitions.

I have 3 primary partitions:

partition1 (ntfs) 
partition 2 (extended)
   extended partition 1 (ntfs)
   extended partition 2 (vfat)
partition 3 (ext3)

(I verified the above layout using qtParted)


(ntfs partitions are courtesy of OEM. I rarely use them anyway.
Yet to find time to put things in the right order).

Ok now here is the problem.
As you can see above, the ext3 partition should be labelled /dev/hda3. Right?
That is how it is in red hat (residing in another disk). But in
debian's fstab it is /dev/hda2.
I don't know how this has come to be. Making this more worse is
debian's lilo.conf
 which has root= options set to /dev/hda3. And that boots ok. Changing
it to hda2 results in a kernel panic. Interested to know what is
happening here...

Reminds me of an ad posting on Times of India (bangalore) during '98
when some company put up a requirement for Java programmers with 5+
years of experience on Java! Whom could I recommend ? Even James Gosling
himself would be underqualified :-P.

  By 1994 there were ~10k users of Linux. But most were in the US or
Western Europe - probably not more than a handful in India, at places
like TIFR, BARC, IITs, etc. I think even I have a CD set from that
era, either SLS or Yggdrasil.

  But it looks the the original poster is looking for 10 years exp.,
not necessarily all of it in Linux.

Can it not be that if the last patition (/) was created earler than
the extended partition in the middle then the / will be hda2.

If the extended was created after deletion of some previous partition
and the primary after it existed before. Just curious here. Do
partitons also have timestamps associated with their creation.

MySQL version 5.0 has support for triggers and stored procedures.  It is
not into production release yet, but yes you can use it for anything but
production web sites.

Dear Friends,

I want to have a common messenger independent of Service Provider
(yahoo/MSN...). It should have voice chat and webcam facility. Is there
any such messenger available?

What about GAIM and skype? Now I am using Yahoo Messenger for Linux,
though it is pretty good, but there is no voice chat or webcam feature.

T.KaruppuSwamy

But does gaim work through a HTTP proxy for yahoo? It does have a proxy 
option but it doesn't seem to work if the proxy doesn't support CONNECT's 
to port 5050. The official messenger works though... but I can't use the 
official messenger because it won't run on my AMD64. :(

No it  does not. Also how do  you guys do video  conferencing (One end
has a  webcam.  the  other (my  side) does not).   The 'one'  end runs
windows XP and can install any form of windows software on it. the 'my

Message-ID: <20040917101521.76045.qmail@web41110.mail.yahoo.com>

My system is having NVIDIA RIVA TNT2 Model 64 display
driver. I am having 
problem in playing tuxracer and some other

games. I downloaded the following driver file from
nvidia site.

NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4496-pkg2.run

I understand, I need to run the file as root and make
necessary changes in 
the
/etc/X11/XF86Config file.

s having nvidia display, what changes I have to make
in the XF86Config-4

for the driver to load properly. Below I have
reproduced relevant section of 
my existing  XF86Config-4 file.

I would like to know from the Mandrake 10 users,what
changes I have to make 
in the XF86Config-4 file?

I read the latest kernel tested successfully was Red
Hat Linux version 
2.4.20-19.9 with the NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4496-pkg2.
Will this work properly 
in Mandrake 10 having kernel 2.6.*.*.

Thanks.

Hi;
In case you are behind a proxy server and want to use gaim change the
port from 5050 to 25 and let the server name be scs.yahoo.com.
you can now continue using gaim !
the official version of yahoo messenger for linux is really bad.there
is a project to add video cam support for linux which is currently a
fork of gaim.once that project is stable it will be merged back to
the main tree.
needless to say contributions welcome :-)

Does this mean the proxy has to support CONNECT's to port 25? I don't 
think anyone will allow this..

Swamy was asking for a messanging client that can be used for all (major 
number of) service providers (protocols). Whereas Jabber is not a messenging 
client but a protocol. Think Sridhar misunderstood the question.

AFAIK lots of proxies do. This is a workaround we were using when
gaim was known as gtkyahoo ! 
you can try doing "telnet scs.msg.yahoo.com 25" from your machine.if
that works then gaim will definitely work.

Only certain jabber servers supports it.  Check jabber.org.

If I'm correct, it does depend on the Jabber server you're using.  Not
all Jabber servers support all the IM protocols.

It will work with Netmeeting,
It dosent matter if you dont have a video device on either side,
Gnomemeeting works on H323 and an audio codec you could agree on
Alternatively you could also use the ohphone (command line) for
videoconferencing,
( will need to build Openh323 and Pwlib for ohphone )

We use ohphone for Embedded Video Conferencing boxes,

Can it not be that if the last patition (/) was created earler than
the extended partition in the middle then the / will be hda2.

If the extended was created after deletion of some previous partition
and the primary after it existed before. Just curious here. Do
partitons also have timestamps associated with their creation.

Message-ID: <20040917231014.GA20969@pcomm.hfi.unimelb.edu.au>

Hi,
    
I'm searching for an ftp mirroring application. It should watch defined
FTP urls, auto download new files/dirs and send email notifications if
any files have been downloaded.  Ability to run on win32 would be great
as it would reduce logistical headaches.

The best app I found so far was Lee McLoughlin's "mirror", but it can't
seem to send email notifications.  I looked for python based ftp
scripts, but they have similar problems.

I have searched the usual suspects freshmeat, sf, google without much
luck.  Can anyone offer some suggestions?

TIA.

So far no video chat-conferencing possible in linux,
(No Client avalilable with that facility) only voice

yahoo is working on a client for linux with voice,
webcam support, anybody has news about it.

It's not the only voice chat client on linux. 
Look at http://www.phonegaim.com/

It's gaim modified to work with the SIP protocol - a  technology
competing with Skype.

haven't tried either, so can't comment on usability, etc.

It's funny though.. here we have IM clients perfectly capable of
transmitting text which can be typed on large comfortable keyboards
but we want to voice chat although the quality might be less than
stellar, the experience less than natural.

And then we have mobile phones where the device is perfectly capable
of transmitting crystal clear voice (well, usually!) but we want to
text chat by abusing our fingers typing SMSs on the most unintuitive
text input device possible.

funny world.

deepak.

I tried getting it to work two months ago, I wasn't that impressed.
While there were nice things like rotating/rendering a window in a 3d
space, there isn't any practical use for it, and it is *slow*. For a
l33t desktop, I still would prefer the enlightenment window manager. I'm
still waiting for the functional release of e-17 (Enlightenment 0.17)
which might provide graphical eye-candy interface, with focus on some
practical usability. And yes, for most of today's machines,
enlightenment isn't "bloated" nor slow for the features it provides (it
runs peacefully on my Pentium-133 with 32 MB RAM laptop).

There was a similar project by name fresco (http://www.fresco.org), and
it seems to me that the project is either waiting for some graphics
programming wizards to pitch in, or possibly, the original developers
are figuring out what to do with it.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

I use skype and the quality is really good, and the experience is almost
natural. It is still not as good as phone, but the advantage is that it is
free. I use it out of the box on a Linux 2.6 kernel, with an i810 sound
card.

Subject: [Ilugc] VSNL 512kbps service
Message-ID: <20040918105324.E805C32C85@whitebox.dias.ath.cx>


I made enquiries about the VSNL broadband service that's being
advertised by various agents, and here is some of the info I've
obtained:

1. There are several plans, related to the monthly download size:

a) 250 MB for Rs.500, Rs.1.75/MB above this.
b) 500 MB for Rs.875  (<- note: this is competitive with BSNL DIAS)
c) 1000 MB for Rs.1500

In all cases, there's a one-time installation charge of Rs.3500, of
which Rs.1000 is refundable.

2. It uses a dry pair (cable) that's run from their remote server site 
(something like a DSLAM) to the client. Not sure if it actually
uses standards-based DSL signalling, but it's probable. It is an
always-on, 512 kbps service.

3. You have a choice of using a USB DSL modem, or a DSL-to-Ethernet
gateway device (the latter is more useful for Linux). There's also
a router device that they're peddling for Rs.9000.

4. I asked if the line protocol was PPPoE - he didn't understand the
question, but claimed that there's both Windows and Linux support.
It seems to suggest a PPPoE connection, but it might just be NAT'ed IP
from their server.

5. It's available in some areas, including Guindy/Ekkatuthangal - it depends
on where they have their DSLAMs.

Some confusion here.  VSNL / Tata Indicom is now what Dishnet DSL has been
rebranded to, and they've been offering 512K ADSL for quite some time at
vastly inflated rates - these are starting to come down though.

That uses PPPoA (PPP over ATM) rather than PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet). 
PPPoE is much easier to support on linux but for PPPoA you'd need a usb
modem or a router type device.

VSNL also was, and is, offering their DIAS service, which I think uses
CorDECT from Prof Jhunjunuwala / TENET at IITM, which basically sounds
like a cut down version of ISDN the last time I checked.

Which is this?

  Ah, so this is just the old Dishnet DSL service. The prices are far
more competitive now, though.

  Aargh, I'd prefer a nice, clean Ethernet interface with PPPoE, which would
allow me to use my own Linux NAT/firewall/router box.

  No, it's BSNL which offers DIAS. It doesn't use CorDECT (which is a
wireless/cellular standard), but rather a wired connection similar to
ISDN. That's what I'm using now, and it's fine, but limited to 128 kbps.

I did this any now it is detecting the hdd. Thanks. But still the
panic persists.

I get the following after having compiled ext3 support and ide support
into the kernel (no initrd).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VFS: Cannot open root device "303" or unknown block(3,3)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown block (3,3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I tried the various solutions listed at 
http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/1955
; but nothing helps.

Unsure of how the new kernel expects the root fs to be specified, I tried
1. root=/dev/hda3
2. root=/dev/hda2
3. root=0303
4. root=0302
in grub. Again nothing helps. 

My /boot/grub/menu.lst

Please help.

The cost of 326 MB for 366 days is Rs. 755/-
50% discount on Data Transfer between 10PM and 10AM
By DT they mean both bytes sent and received
Recently, they claim to have made their rates more competitive.

The onetime installation charge is Rs. 999/- and 150 MB is free with
that valid for 30 days.

Iqara uses a DSL line that is always on.

The DSL Line connects to an ethernet card (Rs. 300/- extra for a DAX card)

Iqara uses PPPoE.  I think they use a MS Server at Thiruvanmiyur, and
they support both Windows and Gnu/Linux.

But, we have to "support" Gnu/Linux ourselves, by searching for the
driver for ethernet card if required, and compiling and installing
RP-PPPoE. Iqara service generally good.

But in some ways, counting bytes sent and received is taking away some
of the freedom in browsing freely.  I use iqara for _email_ only without
having to pay for a telephone call every time I check mail. But, I use
bsnl/vsnl for browsing, though it is relatively slow.

Hello, 

I'm pulling my hair out and have been searching for some answers without
any success. I have Fedora Core 2 installed in my 20GB PATA drive and
got Windows XP in my 80 GB SATA drive. I got grub installed in my PATA
drive and all I need is for grub to boot windows XP which resides on my
SATA drive. 

If I go into the BIOS and change the hard disk order giving SATA the
higher priority, then it does not show grub. That's fine. If PATA is
given a higher priority, it shows the grub menu but shows NTLDR missing
when I go into WindowsXP.

Here's a basic run down of my drive set up.

Primary Master: Hard drive with Fedora Core 2 and grub
Secondary Master: Cd-rom drive
Secondary Slave: dvd-rom drive

SATA Port 1: SATA drive with Windows XP.

regards,
vijay.

All the different color schemes for vim are located in
/usr/share/vim/vim62/colors/ directory.

Create a .vimrc in your home directory and add the
following to it (for example, if you want the pablo
color scheme):

colorscheme pablo

Apart from that, they have also changed there 'unlimited' plans. 
Browsing more than 6 hours per day is not allowed.  If done so, they
one day will be reduced from remaining validity days.  Guess, sify's
gonna crush!!

Is any existing sify 'unlimited' subscribers forced to adopt the new
plan? I think Vasudevan uses it.

PS: Tata indicom @ 512 kbps is known to be available in velachery, but
I wonder whether 250 MB per month is enough for updating my debian
system (with constraint of paying not more than 500 pm) !?

This page
http://eciadsl.flashtux.org/modems.php?lang=en
says the Aztec USB model (provided by VSNL) is *supported* in Linux. 
Has anyone checked it?

I have Touchtel DSL 128 kbps. 550/month for 10 hours. NIGHTS ARE FREE.
On an average i am dloading 4-5 GB per month. After the 10 hours get
over its 30/hour...

Unfortunately i am unable to use linux cos the modem drivers are
unavailable. I have tried the 3rd party drivers available at eciadsl
but they did not work for me...

HACKERS WANTED, FSF CALLING: From the FSF-India mailing list
http://mm.gnu.org.in/mailman/listinfo/fsf-prog there's a word of advice from
Anand Babu <ab@gnu.org.in>: "Yes I am need of developers for Free Software
Projects. If you are new to FSF projects, (you can get started) like this

 	* Setup a Debian GNU/Linux system (best distro for developers)
 	* Create an account for yourself at http://savannah.gnu.org.
 	* Take a look at current GNU Task List at
   	  https://savannah.gnu.org/people/?group=tasklist

Choose one and start hacking. This process will help you prepare yourself
with the GNU's way of hacking software. Then, when you feel you are ready
for the main stream, you can jump into GNU Hurd kernel hacking (the most
important pending task).

Anand Babu <ab@gnu.org.in> said at another time: "Kernel hacking is too
difficult for newbies. I need developers with sold experience in C and
system programming with a Hacker's attitude. I would recommend newbies to
start hacking at the applications level, submitting patches, getting
familiar with GNU coding standards and Free Software development model."

PROMOTING A PROPRIETARY FORMAT, FORCING A PROPRIETARY APPLICATION: V. Sasi
Kumar <vsasi@hotpop.com> of the Centre for Earth Science Studies in Tvn
writes: "Indian Institute of Science asks alumni to fill up their details in
a document in MS Word format. This is a mail I sent them more than two weeks
back. No response as yet.

"Sir, I find that the proforma for membership records is given in a
proprietary format (MS Word) which forces me to use a proprietary
application. Indirectly you are promoting a particular company's software
that uses a closed format for its files, which is not a very good practice
for an internationally reputed institute like IISc.

"Instead, I suggest that the proforma be made available in open formats like
Postscript, PDF, XML, etc. This would enable anyone using any word processor
or any free application (like xpdf, Open Office, etc.) to read the file
without loss of formatting. May I also point out that even our President,
Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, has prompted scientists and technologists to move
from proprietary software to free software for several reasons, including
national security and economics."

While the connectivity seems good (8KB/sec average), their service is
hopeless. If you do opt in for their service, be prepared to wake up one
morning with a bill racking upto 15-18K per month (even though you'd
have opted for an _unlimited_ internet connection of 1500 per month) -
not to mention, they'd bar your connection without any notice, and when
you call them up, they would put you on hold for eternity, and if they
do get back, they'd simply say that they had misplaced your records and
cant access any details and ask you to call back later. 

And everytime you call their help desk, you will have to repeat your
history all over again (I've been through this iteration for 17 times,
in a week).  I've been fighting my way around for a month now. I might
have to drag them to the consumer court for their act of duping
customers. I've been cheated, so be warned. 

I would anyday trust a government run service like BSNL, to these
_shiny_ pvt service providers with their dubious schemes.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Thats  interesting.    Two  people  that   I  know  use  it   here  in

Ok... I got the problem solved and am running a 2.6.8.1 kernel. Just
for the records  I want this scrambled-up howto to be documented.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seeing endless conversations of users having the same problem
with no solutions, I finally decided to drop the idea of compiling
my own kernel (and boy is it humiliating; anyway i got too tired).

So i did a 

apt-get install kernel-image-xxxx 

and rebooted. Voila! The booting passed beyond the panic point into
runlevel1. Then I did a

module-assistant auto-install nvidia

to get the nvidia drivers compiled for the new kernel. 
(module-assistant is a apt-get kind of thing for installing
drivers. AFAIK it is available only for debian.)

module-assistant reported errors. I had to install
kernel-headers-xxxx; mod-assis went fine now. But the xserver refused
to start(IIRC module nvidia not found). I had to install the
all the packages recommended when module-assistant was 
doing an apt-get as part of its process. Then X went beyond that point
and now errored that it could not find the device /dev/psaux. The dev
fs seems to have been changed in 2.6. IIRC cat /proc/bus/input/devices
revealed only the keyboard. So I added mousedev and psmouse to
/etc/modules, changed /dev/psaux and all other old referneces to mouse
(2 of them totally)
to /dev/input/mice in the xconfig file  and rebooted. And  yeah..
voila.. everything is working now.. it is faster.. but the cd/dvd
writing system is broke (a reported bug). I haven't had time to
experience much of the kernel to warrant all the trouble/time.
But I am hopeful... lets see.

Hi

IMHO you can use wget utility for this purpose even though I have not 
tried it. Mailing will not be a problem as you can put wget and mail

  YMMV - depending on the range and number of subscribers, the bandwidth

It's not broadband, for sure. You'd be better off with dialup.

that is the easy way out - and it should work for people who dont want 
to compile their own kernels.

one tip is to compile as many things as are absolutely essential during 
bootup (required filesystems etc) into the kernel, and compile other 
stuff (network / video etc) as modules.

another way to go would be to get a debian source package, edit the 
config file to add / remove certain options (such as removing a bunch of 
stuff compiled into the kernel that you dont use, or stopping the 
compilation of modules for a whole lot of hardware that you dont have) 
and do a make-kpkg to build a new kernel deb for your system, compiled 
to your processor instead of for i386

hotplug and udevd for 2.6 .. see if you have a package called udevd or 
udev in debian and install that.

When I had subscribed for their service, I had clearly mentioned (in
writing) that I was interested in the 1500 (unlimited) plan. Lately,
they _magically_ moved my subscription to the 40 paise per minute plan.
As I generally leave my system connected almost 20+ hours a day on the
net, they sent me a bill calculating for 419 hours of usage, last month.
When I enquired, their usual reply was "we misplaced your records..." or
"please kindly contact Mr. foo from the billing department" who's line
remains engaged forever. Lately, after the whole issue got heated up a
bit, they requested me to make the full payment for the invoice
generated, and they would adjust the charges in the forth-coming bills -
which clearly shows how committed they are to their customers. Since the
last 21 days, my outgoing calls and internet connectivity remain barred.
To put in simple words, they are not willing to acknowledge their fault
or mistake - which was one of the reasons why I hate their service.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

hi,

has anyone customized Bugzilla for general purpose issue tracking ? We
want such a tracking system similar to the Remedy ticket tracking system.

I would like to know the extend to which i can configure Bugzilla for
such a requirment. At present, i think, with its default settings, it
assums that the user is tracking bugs related to a 'product'. My requirment
is not 'product' centric but 'service' centric.

Thats  true.  But  you  can   very  well  use  Bugzilla  for  'issues'
tracking. Noticed  the 'CC:' field in  bugzilla? You can  assign it to
the  servicing engineer's  pager/email and  get him  to attend  to the
issue in real-time. 

P1/P2/etc.,.. "severities" can also be used in the service context.

unless I'm missing out something  that you have a specific requirement
for, I think bugzilla is good enough.

Hi all,

Replying a very old mail as i was just filtering my mails today.

I have installed OpenOffice.org 1.1.1 successfully on SlackWare 10 using the installation binaries provided with the CHIP CD for May 2004.
But have a small problem. The fonts are getting all mixed up. I mean i already had some presentations designed using the same package on Suse 9.1 Pro and the fonts dont display correctly in slackware.

I got myself the standard openoffice install binary (72 megs or so) that 
I downloaded when I was abroad - airport lounges have surprisingly fat 
pipes, especially late at night :)

I haven't noticed the behavior you mention on version 1.1.2 which is 
what I downloaded - still looks like it's the latest version.

6 hours per day limitation is applicable for only 64kbps (64-92 kbps) shared. 
For 32 kbps (32-64 kbps), they have a different restriction. Only the first 75 MB 
download of the day will operate at 32-64 kbps. Rest of the download will clock only 
at 24 kbps. It will be reset in the next day.

I talked to them and they said that users started using a lot of peer-peer sharing 
clients and keep downloading 24x7 which causes the other users to suffer.

I have opted for 9pm - 9am 128 kbps. There is no such restrictions on this plan. I 
will be connected tomorrow. I will let you know by Friday.

PS: An extremly out of topic question. Sorry for this. It seems that Sify forces 
to use Mc Afee with Windows and also forces to uninstall any other AV installed on 
the system? Any idea about this?

I'm totally comfortable to rsync and all that.  The difficult bit is 
"the other guys" who will not quit using ftp and embrace modern file
distribution technology.

My ftp mirror will be a critical piece of software, and it's imperative
that it works/fails gracefully.  Hence my reluctance to deploy a weekend
hack.  I've decided to customize 'mirror' for my task and see how it
goes.

Thanks for all the suggestions.

We are just going through the process of deploying RT3 in our
orgnisation for email tracking (our customer support receives hundreds
of mail daily).  The system is going live tomorrow morning.

The reason I mention this is because I've spent the past 2 weeks
researching open sourced and commercial CRMs and nothing comes close to
RT in terms of flexibility and ease of customisation.  But be warned
that RT3 can be a pain to install due to its extensive perl module
dependencies (unless you run debian sarge ofcourse ;-)

If you do not require lengthy complex workflows, try www.otrs.org and
mailmanager.sf.net.  See
    http://linas.org/linux/pm.html
for an exhaustive list of CRM and other solutions.

do you need the feature of generating reports from the database ? if
yes, what are you doing for that, as RT's site asks users to use tools
like Crystal Report to fetch and generate reports. RT it seems doesn't 
have this inbuild facility. (or does it?)

RT does not include builtin reports.

The "incremental search/filter" feature on the rt/Search/Listing.html
page is very flexible.  It allows you to generate several common reports
on a real-time basis.

Beyond this, my management only wanted 3 reports which we wrote some
perl code to get it together.

on freebsd its just a simple matter of doing

# cd /usr/ports/www/rt3-elixus (or rt3, or rt32 if you want rt3 / rt3.2)

# make install clean

I guess you could do "emerge sync rt3" or something on gentoo

Come to think of it, rpm is not too bad if you have rpm packages for rt 
- it is reasonably good at resolving dependencies these days.

Message-ID: <3779a1e7040920214845592972@mail.gmail.com>

I think that 2.6 series of kernels have a feature that makes it possible to 
create a .config file from a running kernel. Anybody knows how to do this?

The reason I want to do this is because I got a working 2.6.8.1 system by
apt-get ting a kernel-image; since I failed to get my custom kernel working
the debian way (make-kpkg / dpkg -i). So I want to know what options I
missed out compiling into the kernel (besides the file systems and ide 
device support... etc)

I have almost the same setup and had the same problem. I just tried
installing lilo (on the IDE IIRC) and it worked. This might not be a
solution. There might be a way to make grub work. But.. I don't know..
if you are looking to get your work done... give this a try.

Do an ls -al in the /usr/src/linux directory (or look in /usr/src for 
your kernel version)

You will find the .config file that was used to build the kernel there

I  dont know  about the  'generating-config-from-running-kernel' thing
because I  dont run 2.6.  But  if you apt-getted a  debian kernel, its
config file is also packaged along in /boot/config-*

  I think it needs to be compiled in; with this option, the .config shows
up somewhere on /proc (possibly /proc/config). I haven't looked at what the
entries look like. It's a pretty neat idea, but brings a whole can of worms
with it - a lot of userland programs are going to be written that adapt
dynamically at runtime to kernel options, increasing the difficulty of
validation, debugging, version control ... (maybe I'm wrong).

If you did "Enable access to .config through /proc/config.gz" in "General Setup" (at the 'make menuconfig', or CONFIG_IKCONFIG=y, CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC=y in your .config file) while compiling your 2.6 kernel, you can access your .config file of a running kernel by simply copying /proc/config.gz to a different directory and 'gunzip'-ing the same.

Chandrashekar Babu.

Well, we host lycos, and I know some admins at rediff. So lets see what

getting this guy's website kicked off is more important though - yahoo

  Atalji ...err.. Atulji :)  is under a very wrong impression. My personal
belief is that poor representation of Delhi LUG is because of physical
distance. There is no conspiracy/ego thing about this.

For those of us who cant afford air fares for reaching such conferences, 
this
is generally a week long affair, in which a third of the time is spent 
on the
train. How many people can afford that much time off from work every year?

The best way to ensure a pan-indian participation is to keep rotating the
event (like say Linux India  2004) in different state capitals every year.
Till then, LB will be a predominantly Bangalore/Southern-India centric 
event
attended by either people from nearby regions or by people who have the 
money
or time.

- Sandip

P.S. Sorry for sounding petty, but I am just venting my frustation at not
being able to attend any worthwhile Linux events(other than LA-2004) in the
past 5+ years that I have been involved in the Indian Linux community,
because of my limited means.

P.S.2. This seems to be intended for all LUGs in India. I wonder why it 
wasnt
posted in LIG first.

Ok, I have now dropped the option of Tata Indicom's internet at Rs.
1500.  Including the rent, one should pay about Rs. 2000 per month, a
bit costlier.  Also the speed can't be ensured.

So I decided to check out VSNL's 512 kbps.  I am planning to go with
the 500 MB limit option.  I hope that would be enough for me including
weekly (selective) sid upgrades.

They use Aztech USB modem, but I just want to know whether anyone
using this service is able configure this modem in Linux.  I saw this
modem listed in eciadsl, but wonder how practically it works.  Yet to
call their customer care center.

Just saw their FAQ ...

>From http://vsnl.ddsl.net/ourproducts/dslfaqs.asp

---------------------------
Can any Operating System (OS) work with your USB and Router Plans? 

USB Modem plans are compatible with only Windows 98, Windows 2000 and
Windows XP Operating systems. Router Plans with compatible with any
OS- Including any Windows OS and Linux OS.
---------------------------

I hope the modem would work in Linux, as the drivers are available for
Aztech.  But somebody having this service needs to test it out.


Also the USB Modem (Rs. 2500) or Router (Rs. 8000) that you buy is
only for lease period.  You must return them back later!!
---------------------------
Do I own the USB Modem or DSL Router that is provided to me at the
time of installation of connection?

The USB Modem or DSL Router is provided to you on an "Operative lease"
basis and is the property of VSNL. The USB Modem or DSL Router has to
be returned back to VSNL in case you wish to terminate the connection.

2.Regarding a place of stay- This is my first time to bangalore.
So I am out of info here,,,

could you guys suggest any medium level-decent  hotels.

Subject: [Ilugc] Debian install over network
Message-ID: <a0c4f6270409220022284533e@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,
In the IITM campus, I have fast access to the Debian mirror at
ftp.iitm.ac.in. I want to install Debian (unstable) onto my computer.
One way to do this, I guess, is to get hold of a Knoppix CD, install
it on to my hard disk and then use the APT repository to get the
things I want. But I went for install over network, and did not
succeed, since the installer did not detect my hard disk! Then, I
somehow managed to fiddle around in expert mode and get the hard disk
detected, and the base install went on fine, but upon restart, it did
not complete the install since it could not contact the APT
repository, although I set the correct network settings.

The exact error I receive whenever i try this now, is "no
partitionable media found" when it comes to the partitioning disks
stage.

I use a proxy server to access the internet, and was installing using
a set of floppies.

Has anybody tried this out?

Thank you.

Actually, this is part of the install procedure for OpenACS (have a 
look, it's a cool project, but installation is a PITA), it should help 
you install Oracle on Linux. Look in the section "Installing Oracle 
8.1.7 Server".

Hi sudharsan,

Recntly i got 64kpbs DSL from Touchtel... It is not eciadsl modem.. it 
is Conexant modem.. accessrunner is the suitable driver.. i.e cxacru is 
the driver name.. i am working on it for last 1 week.. today i am able 
to load the driver, but pppd daemon fails saying that "LCP: timeout 
sending Config-Requests".. i nam looking into it.. soon I will do it...! 
I will come with detailed doc once it is over.. it is really a nice 
experience when the ISP ignores Linux, we are able to move successfully 
with the help of internet....

Regards
T.KaruppuSwamy

Hi,
	Im connecting VNC server remote display using VNC viewer. Im able
to get remote X windows on VNC. But I couldnt open any new terminal or
application on the VNC screen. Like if I give xview 2.jpg, it gives the
following error:

> Xlib: connectionto <server name> refused by server.
> Xlib: Maximum number of clients reached.

I hope this not VNC problem. something related to X server. Im using
fedora core 1, with kde.

randover validates users and data .

practical example of randover-

-credit card authentication
-user authentication
-logins
-and more

imagine bering able to authenticate the user where the user has the
control over the login process

randover stands for (rando)m (ver)ification of user data

so randover authenticates the user via a random question.

the process is like this
step1. user registers on the site
step2. user login
 -user is asked a random question.
if answer is correct he is logged in.
if answer is wrong he is not logged in.

its just 10 lines of code that can change the way user logs into the system.

it can be used alone or integrated with existing systems

its a algorithm for user security.

  What are you telling? If it is a random question, the answer is also 
  random and it accepts everyone.

  Cryptography and related fields are very tough. It requires good 
  understanding and peer review.

  Pls look into www.counterpane.com or cryptogram newletter fame and
  author of many good security books Bruce Schiener articles.

  There are no silver bullets man.

what kind of questions ? is it like - when was the last time you 
logged in ? and so on ?  

Once i forgot my ICICI card pin, and called up their helpdesk for
a pin change. They asked me to recall the last two transaction 
amounts.  I couldn't, and had to go to their office, fill a form 
and get it done.

So what will your auth system do when a valid user is not able to 
answer the random questions ? ask more questions ?

My guess ---> the user has to know answers for a list of questions. The
auth system, will choose one of THESE at radom.

Not that these list of questions are generated on the fly.........

 I do like the ICICI transaction. The process they did is very much
 correct for security reasons.

List of questions -> Data feeded at the time of registration such as 
Dob, city, pin, state etc etc.

The system get list of fields from "users" table and randomly selects a 
field out of it. And presents in front of user to answer.

This is what code says.

What about if the (random) question comes to "Enter your uid"? ;)

Vinay

RP-PPPoE has a TCL/Tk based gui called tkpppoe, with which you can
easily configure and use. tkpppoe is usually found in the "gui" source
directory. Of course, you would run tkpppoe like this:

# wish tkpppoe

  For RP-PPPoE, you don't need to assign a static IP address to the
eth interface (in fact, you should not). adsl-start will assign an
IP address to the PPPoE interface (say ppp0) when it connects.

Also post a review of your success story .. so that I could freely go
for Iqara.

btw, I can't get a knowledge of the installation charges from their
site.  What is the deposit. Do I have to pay for the modem, if not
what is the rent?

Compilation of a 2.6 kernel module is different from a
2.4. Check this link:

I don't know about fedora core 2.. I've been using gentoo on an AMD64 
with an ASUS K8V-X motherboard for about two weeks.. no problems.

Almost all the apps work perfectly fine with -march=athlon64... except 
OpenOffice which needs the 32bit emulation libraries. But you won't notice 
anything different after you install it.

Subject: [Ilugc] Connect 2004 exhibition highlights
Message-ID: <20040925030347.CEAE8329BA@whitebox.dias.ath.cx>


  I visited the Connect 2004 Exhibition at the Chennai Trade Centre,
and here are the highlights - mostly gadget-focussed, I'm not really
interested in the zillion companies selling VB development services.

1. Both AMD and Intel had large booths, and AMD is emphasizing AMD64
(as expected). They trotted out a 2-CPU Celestica Opteron box, but
not a demo model, just a static showpiece. 

2. Palm was there through their local distributor. Tungstens and other
hardware were there on display.

3. The Simputer people were there at the rear, with some Simputers on
demo. Too bulky and kludgy, IMO. The build quality was about the same
as 1st-generation Taiwan-made mobiles 15 years ago.

4. AMI had a superb 1U NAS with 4 hot-swap SCSI slots and 2 Gbit Ethernet
interfaces, running embedded Linux. Pricey at Rs.1.80 lakhs without the
drives - but superb engineering. They also had a PCI MegaRAC server
management card.

5. There was an 1U dual-Xeon with an Intel 7210 motherboard and 2 hot-swap
slots. Rs.80k was the base pricing - not too expensive really, but I'd
prefer the dual Opteron 1U.

6. Lots of notebooks - Fujitsu's local distributor had brought a ton of
Pentium M notebooks, and one ultra-small Transmeta Crusoe based Lifebook.
HP brought a pen-pad and some other Pentium M notebooks. However, not a
single AMD64 mobile in sight.

7. HP had a nice USB 2.0 external 8x DVD writer for Rs.11k.

8. Benq had a bunch of stuff including a DLP projector, LCD flat-panel
TVs, etc. In fact, a lot of the booths had flat-panel TVs - looks like
it's the hot meme of the moment.

9. Finally, the creme-de-la-creme: There's a Linksys distributor from
Coimbatore who offers the Linksys WRT54G for Rs.5800! For those who
aren't familiar with the WRT54G, it's a Linux-based broadband/wireless
router that's been extensively hacked/improved by junta. If there's one
thing at the show that I immediately wanted to buy, it was the WRT54G.
I'm dying to put generic 2.4 with FreeSWAN/IPsec on it. It's ideal for
all the community mesh networks that are sprouting up all over the place.

   suppose your module is hello.c. Do create a makefile as follows:
        obj-m :=3D hello.o
   save it and compile it as follows:
       make -C /pathtolinuxkernelsource SUBDIRS=3D$PWD modules.

    for more info, refer kbuild in the Documentation directory of the

Hi,
How do I install a GUI Desktop (KDE or GNOME) from text console.
I already have Redhat Linux 7.3 running on the system with nothing related
to graphics installed.

You could upgrade your system using the RedHat 7.3 CDs itself and
install everything required.

Then when the system starts up(if you havent changed it to start in
graphics mode) then change the default runlevel to 5 in /etc/inittab.

Reboot.

I think it should work.

You mean to say you did all that so fast. Wow your system is good.
Anyway myself just shifted to slackware. Dont know much but i think
the above solution should work.

Mind you,upgrading slackware may not be as easy as RedHat.

Slackware 8.1 is really old - around the same vintage as redhat 7

The latest version is slackware 10

And for upgrading slackware - google for this set of shell scripts 
called "swaret"

Message-ID: <8816fcf8040925080016739cc0@mail.gmail.com>

I have applied for Touctel [1] dedicated ADSL line - 128 kbps @ 500 MB
transfer limit per month.  They are renting the router (costs Rs.
6000) for Rs. 200 per month (USB modem doesn't work in Linux).  The
total tariff is Rs. 1000 + Rs. 200 per month.  I asked for one of the
unlimited plans, but they refused to provide routers for such plans
them.

Since 500 MB is not enough to keep my debian box updated each month, I
have decided to go for offline dist-upgrades (my college).  With the
left-overs I wonder if I ever require more than 500 MB assuming I
occationally do large downloads. (I am a dial-up user so far)

Also, though the traffic is metered in touctel site, I want one to be
in my own box.  Anything you know about this ?

[1] now known as AirTel (Bharti)

PS: I bought Intex Ethernet, and configured it to work in linux using
fealnx kernel module.

My wild guess - by being funded by affiliate websites that sell music
online. Nullsoft (which makes winamp) was be owned by AOL, and AOL
_also_ makes money by selling music online (thus using Winamp for
advertising their online music site, perhaps). 

The last time I heard, the lead developer and the author of Winamp was
planning to quit Nullsoft due to AOL's restriction and control over his
thought and development of Winamp, in order to help their business.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT]My experience with SIfy broadband.
Message-ID: <41559B44.6050807@symonds.net>

For the past few days, there are quite a lot of discussions going on in 
ILUGC mailing list about various broadband services. Yesterday I got 
Sify broadband for my home PC. I thought that it would be of some use to 
share my experience with Sify.

I am residing at Chinmaya Nagar, Virugambakkam. The main reason that I 
went for Sify is that there was no other service provider in my area 
(ignoring dial-up). Touchtel is not having copper in this area. No Hathway.

The installation charge was INR. 3000. Since I had my own ehternet card 
(nVidia nForce MCP), I haven't paid that extra INR.500 for the ethernet 
adapter. The way the wire the PC is through RJ45 cable. The nearest 
switch from my home was about 130m. They used CAT 5E cable. My PC runs 
Fedora Core 2 and Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional. The dealer said 
that he will configure the Windows network setup for me so that I can 
use the same thing for Linux as well. He was having no idea of Linux. My 
PC was given 10.x.x.x IP address and he gave me a couple of nameservers 
to use. Once the Windows network setup was completed, he went to one of 
the Sify login servers and downloaded the Sify login tool for Windows. 
While starting the setup, it asked to uninstall the Norton Antivirus 
2004 that I had on my system. It forced me to use McAfee virus scanner. 
I said to the dealer that I don't want to use McAfee, instead I would 
like to stay with the exisiting NAV 2004. He called up some technical 
guys mananging the firewall (sify's) sitting at Tidel park to change the 
policy for my IP address. Once they did it I installed the Sify login 
tool without any problem.

The dealer then logged in using his account and created a user name for 
me. I bought the package "9pm to 9am, 128kbps, unlimited bandwidth". It 
costs INR. 360. The dealer left once everything was working fine.

Then I rebooted into Fedora Core 2. Once I got up the prompt, I was 
shocked to see the ethernet link status as disconnected. I was wondering 
why it is so. Again I rebooted into Windows and found that it was 
working. I struggled for more than 15 minutes and later I found that the 
problem was because that the speed setting of the card was in 
"Autonegotiate" mode. Then I changed it to "10BaseT-HD" using 'mii-tool' 
after which the link was up. I downloaded the login tool for Linux from 
their login server. Tried once under Fedora, suceeded and rebooted. I 
have tested the speed both in Windows and Fedora. It was ranging from 
120-128kbps. So far so good.

Then I inserted my Debian 3.0r1 installation CD, installed the core 
system and immediately upgraded to the Sarge with my local Sarge CD set 
which is almost one year old. After which, I pointed apt to the 
Singapore Debian mirror and did a dist-upgrade. Then I installed Gnome 
(2.6) and KDE over Internet. Throughout the installation, the speed was 
ranging from 15.8 kBps to 16kBps. Absolutely good. Last night itself, I 
downloaded around 600 MB without any problem. Not even a single 
disconnection.

I am more than happy with this product. True value for INR. 360.

Just my 2 cents.

This seems to be a nice bargain. The only option (in selected towns of 
Kerala)  to have
a cheap Internet connection is Asianet cable ISP. They charge 600 rupees 
for a
10pm to 8am connection with 64kbps (shared) bandwidth. They allow smtp 
and pop3
access to their mail server, 24 hrs. They have facility to download 
mails from other pop3
servers also (thru their webmail interface).

Ha ha, in my case, it is the reverse.  With touchtel internet, I will

Also it would be better if application wise bandwidth consumption is

I have also bought a ten hour pack for day usage. Normally on week days 
I will be in Office. So as saturday. On sunday, the this package offers 
free connectivity. So problem solved. I would use internet in my home at 
day once in a blue moon.

only .ko module, I need to  Please let me know how to convert (compile)

I hope, modules.txt, in Documentation dir of your kernel src, will 
explain this.

  Perhaps Olitec supplied a binary-only module, e2.o, for some
specific 2.4.x kernel. In that case, there's no easy way to make
it work on 2.6.

  OTOH, if there's a GPLed driver, it can be ported to 2.6 with some
effort - the main benefit of FLOSS.

  In general, you should completely avoid buying hardware for which
there is no GPLed driver, to avoid situations like this. Try
writing to Olitec and complaining, if there's no open-source driver.

If your modem is a globespan chipset, use
<url=http://eciadsl.flashtux.org>Flashtux's ADSL driver</url>. It
works quite well, but it's in userspace, not kernelspace.

i am using Reliance FWP 
Connecting to Internet using the reliance dialer for linux 
since it is command line interface, it does not have any option to find the 
duration of connectivity.
[ we have to use "rconnect <username> <password>" to login and "rdisconnect" 
to diconnect ]

how to find the duration of internet connectivity ? [ ie, internet usage ]

You can write a script that will be wrapper to these commands (based on
CLI options). Redirect the time of connection and the time of
disconnection to a common file (use success/failure of making the
connection as the basis).

Just copy the following to a script:

_________________________________________________
#!/bin/bash

case $1 in
	'login')
		rconnect <username> <password>
		if [ $? -ne 0 ]
		then
			date >> /var/log/reliance.log
		fi;;
	'logout')
		rdisconnect
		if [ $? -ne 0 ]
		then
			date >> /var/log/reliance.log
		fi;;
esac
_________________________________________________

	That must help... Provided rconnect and rdisconnect return 0.

	To check this:
$ rconnect <uname> <passwd>

On successful login:
$ echo $?

	Use the value printed here in the place of 0 in the script.

I typically use an IPTables chain that just tickles counters. I then
extract this info and use rrtdtool to draw nice hourly/daily/etc graphs.

With this method you can get source ip, dest ip, port bandwidth
consumption but not application level usage.

Hai,

I would like to know how Linux and Unix differ technically from 
implementation point of view----like what are the basic differences between 
Linux and Unix---if any.


Also I would like to know how a major number of a device file is used to 
identify a driver .

  You'll need to read the Lion's annotated commentary on Unix and similar
books on the Linux kernel (like the Coriolis Press Core Linux Kernel
commentary) to understand the differences. However, I'll summarize a
few:

1. Unix was written for the DEC PDP-7 as a simple time-sharing OS alternative
to the Multics OS. It was subsequently ported to various other platforms,
including the PDP-11, DEC VAX-11, various AT&T and NCR systems, etc.
You can get an idea of its history at the Unix history page:

http://www.levenez.com/unix

Linux, OTOH, was specifically targetted at the Intel 80386 CPU, and was
designed as a POSIX-compliant monolithic OS with support for virtual
memory. Most of the device drivers initially supported only PC/AT 
peripherals.

2. Unix did not originally have TCP/IP networking support - this work was
done at UC Berkeley and does not belong to the AT&T codebase. Linux has
had TCP/IP networking support from a very early stage in its development.

3. Linux was dependent on the GNU environment (OS, compilers, tools, etc.)
for development as well as a self-hosting platform and is still critically
dependent on it for most applications. OTOH, Unix had a pre-existing
environment that predates the GNU project.

  (In simpler terms, GNU and Linux are symbiotic; whereas proprietary
Unices have their own userland, which in some cases can be replaced by a
GNU userland).

  Basically, a driver registers itself with the kernel, at initialization
time, identifying the major number it will handle. Subsequent operations
performed on that device file will result in a syscall into the kernel
which will then transfer control to that driver.

Prodigy is a state level technical event conducted for the school
students by Anna University College of Engineering Guindy ACM Student
Chapter

About 500 students from 100 schools all over Tamil Nadu are expected
to participate in this event to be held on 11th October 2003. This
contest is open to students from 9th Std to 12th Std. It aims at
enhancing awareness among school students on the latest trends and
technologies encouraging them to go beyond their textbooks and explore
their latent potential in a state-wide extravaganza

http://cs.annauniv.edu/~portal/wiki/index.php/Prodigy_2003

We used to distribute CDs containing Windows freeware, games,
educational tools previous years.  This year we are planning to give
Knoppix CDs to the students.

We are looking for potential sponsors.  The companies sponsoring for
Prodigy will be credited by display of logo in the CD cover. 
Sponsoring more than 5000 bucks, will get you one of the following
benefits.


* You can put a stall in the event premises.
* Your name will be associated with one of the events.
    Already Nalli Soft solutions has agreed to be a overall sponsor.
* We are about to get THE HINDU as the sponsor for the quiz.
* Your company name will be associated with the Prodigy posters.

You can sponsor for the Deligate kits also..
  In that case, your company name will be printed on the deligate
accessories, like file, notepad, pen etc..

If you are interested in sponsoring,

I would like to know how to handle multiple select entries correctly.
Is there no way i can avoid them from being over written. Theni have
to use check boxes i guess.  but again how do i parse out of the
variable number of sent in check boxes. The whole problem is that the
options available itself will be dynamic and out of that i have to
choose further.

Regarding text area how to manipulate the new line and line feed
correctly. so that the line changes in display also as in input.

Hi All,

I would like to know if i can use MySQL MaxDB instead of MySQL
Database server on my LAMP based project. I was going through the
MySQL site and found that MaxDB supports triggers and stored
procedures and is available like all other MySQL products in Dual
licensing. (therfeore makes no difference if i use it).

Can i connect to it using PHP.

You can use an array for the name. ex:

<select name=choices[] multiple>
<option value=1>a</option>
<option value=2>b</option>
...
</select>

Now you will get all the selected values across in your PHP code.

Same with Checkboxes. Use name=choices[].  Of course, you will have to
dynamically create the checkboxes, something like:

foreach ($values as $key => $value) {
	echo "<input type=checkbox value=$key> $value\n";
}

What display?  you mean when you  'echo' whatever textarea  out in PHP
you dont see the multilines? use '<pre>' in that case.

You can also use the nl2br() function to convert newlines to html breaks
before displaying.

PS. You might want to use htmlspecialchars() too!

Read the manual http://www.php.net/

Basically, the original Unix spawned the definition of POSIX or
Portable Operating System standards. These standards were then used by
many OSs, including the Mac OS X and BeOS. Among these was Linux, the
kernel, and GNU the toolset.

So, in essence, Linux is a clone of the Unix that works on the x86
(and now, many other processors). Or, if you prefer it, an
implementation of the POSIX standards.

Thanks Bharathi... ur suggestion helped me a lot.. these documents are 
easy to read.. i wrote my own Makefile for the exising driver based on 
this modules.txt help file... :)  :) 

Now I am able to make .ko file without any problem.. but i am facing 
some unknown symbols while loading the driver... yet to trace it out...

I am enjoying a lot...

Prefix the filename with a dot `.'.  You can see hidden files using the
`-a' argument in ls (ls -a).

The major number is useful in creating a DEVICE NODE. One of the
parameters to the command mknod is the major number. The device node is
useful to access the device related things. 

For more details please go through the 3rd chapter of Linux Device
Driver by Rubini 2nd Edition.

Google won't help you if you search for entirely the wrong thing.

Articles / books won't help you either if you are searching for the 
wrong thing

This guy wanted to search for rrdtool and searched for rrtdtool instead

Message-ID: <415A3995.000001.01008@SITHALADEVI>

Hi All,
 
I have been trying to install Fedora Core 2 on my External Hard Disk Samsung
160 GB connected to my Laptop thru the USB Port.
 
Steps followed are as follows:
 
1. Connected the External HDD to my USB (This HDD already has some partition
of NTFS for 80GB).
2. Booted the Laptop using the Fedora Core 2 DVD.
3. Requested for Graphical Installation by press ENTER key at the boot
prompt
4. Selected all the options until the partition information was requested
5. Selected Manual with Disk Drud.
6. The External HDD connected thru the USB Port did not show up in the Disk
Drud Disk Information dialog
7. My existing of the Laptop with 40 GB only showed. This HDD contains Win
XP Professional Dual Boot with Fedora Core 2.
8. Out of 40 GB, 6 GB is allocated for Fedora Core 2.
9. If I boot into my Fedora Core 2 using the Grub option, then in the System
Information - Hard Disks I find the USB Drive detected as follows:
sad, sda1, sda2, sda3, and rest of the unallocated space of 80 GB.
 
Request to advice as how I would be able to make the Fedora Core 2 - Disk
Drud detect my External HDD while installing itself.
 
Purpose:
I want to remove the Fedora Core 2 Installation from Laptop and dedicate one
separate HDD for the Fedora Core 2. Started of doing this when was not able
to compile the Kernel due to insufficient space in my Laptop HDD.
 
Appreciate early response.
 
Thanx, Sriram

  The simplest option is to just forget about the external hard disk, and
use more space from the internal 40 GB hard disk for the existing Fedora
install. You can either completely blow away the Windows XP partition, or
resize it using FIPS (if you're using a FAT partition for XP). Add
an additional Linux partition with fdisk, format it using mkfs and make
it mountable using fstab - and you're home free.

  The second option is to use the remaining space on the USB hard drive
for an additional, mountable, Linux filesystem for a sub-directory, say
/home/build or something. This is not going to be suitable for any
I/O intensive work, like kernel rebuilding, because it's sitting on
USB-attached storage. It's not worth trying to use it as a root filesystem
either (in case you want to put the entire distro on it).

  You don't need to re-install Fedora for either of these options. (In
general, it's never necessary to re-install a Linux distro from scratch.
If you think you need to do that, you probably don't understand what you
want to do.)

Hi

I am loading USB ADSL driver through insmod.... while loading it says :

unknown symbol exit_fs
unknown symbol exit_files

I found these functions in kernel source as exported using EXPORT_SYMBOL 
macro. But ADSL driver not able to recognize it..  what i am supposed to 
with makefile to solve this issue...?  since makefile is completely 
rewritten by me for 2.6.8.1 kernel, i suspect makefile.. :)  :)   (the

Hi all,
I am into the group after a very long time. I was having a talk with
one of the committee members of IEEE Madras. IEEE Chennai section
wants to conduct a workshop/demo/something on Linux(GNU/Linux)  for
its members (student or otherwise), by ILUGC. It could be something
like "ILUGC conducts Linux workshop for IEEE members", or something
like that. I would like to have your views/comments, feasibility,
resources needed, etc? for the same. Please throw in your ideas,
views, etc? on what and how can be done.

Hi

seems to be good idea.... But,  if we have more info on the nature of 
audience, then it would be easy to define scope of workshop.
I mean,
1. The educational qualification of audience (average)
2. The work domain of audience
3. Their experience level in industry
4. last but not least, aim of workshop

If Mr. Natarajan can make these points clear, ILUGC can do a make a 
successful workshop.

T.KaruppuSwamy

It'd first give you a whole lot of porn sites that provide "celebrity 
pics" ... models that look like actresses etc (or maybe photoshop edited 
pics) and names that are very very close to the names of the original 
actress :)

I know about this project and I am running this(on both Win and Linux)
but the chances to find an alien signal is very very small. after 
finding that there is a candidate signal, SETI@Home again scans the same 
portion of the sky, but they will not get the same signal back. It is 
very difficult unless the aliens are constantly sending the radio 
signals(24hrs)
BUt I am interested. and I will continue to run it.

Here are some reasons *not* to run seti -

 1. Seti's source code is not published.  For all you know, you could
    doing nuclear bomb simulation and not be searching for ET in your
    PC.

 2. A modern CPU consumes ~80W of electricity under full load.  When
    your CPU is idle, Linux puts your cpu to low power state (~4W)
    If you keep your CPU usage constantly at 100% by running seti -
        a. you get a big electricity bill,
        b. you overheat your computer and will cause premature failure
           of HDD, motherboard and CPU.

 3. Seti is a potential security risk  - seti has been hacked in the
    past.

 4. You buy a fast PC for you to use and enjoy.  Not to donate to other
    projects.  Running seti is not free and you are footing someones
    research bills.

 5. Running seti on your office pc is a good way to lose your job.

Hi,

I would like to add the following details to my previous mail.

Audiance Expected:
IEEE Members only (Engineering students, Electrical, Electronics and
Computer Engineers, Senior people(?)).

Prof. Sriram had previously given a talk to IEEE earlier this year,
and we got a good response of about 100 people(from all over tamil
nadu).

The crowd is expected to be a good mix of completely novice to
partially experienced (in particular areas.) on Linux. But I guess
most of them have atleast the basic knowledge about Computers, and
many (?) might know some amout of coding also.

It would be nice if we could focus the show to an Engineering audiance.


As of the projecters stuff... .IEEE will arrange for us. We will have
to provide the volunteers, the software and the like. But I doubt, if
IEEE would be able to procure Linux boxes for the demo. If it is not
able to get that, then we will have to provide that also. IEEE would
arrange the place and other infrastructure (we have to specify what).
I quite doubtfull about linux boxes being organized by IEEE.


As of the timings... IEEE is looking into the month of October... some
weekend in October is what is in the mind right now.

so... to summarize, what they expect from us is a bunch of volunteers,
to conduct an workshop or a demo. If they are not able to provide the
Linux boxes and the software, then, we might have to take that also.
The infrastructure (place, timing, mic, power, projecters, audiances
and the like are in their court.


Thanks and regards,

Natarajan.

-------------

Hi all,
I am into the group after a very long time. I was having a talk with
one of the committee members of IEEE Madras. IEEE Chennai section
wants to conduct a workshop/demo/something on Linux(GNU/Linux)  for
its members (student or otherwise), by ILUGC. It could be something
like "ILUGC conducts Linux workshop for IEEE members", or something
like that. I would like to have your views/comments, feasibility,
resources needed, etc? for the same. Please throw in your ideas,
views, etc? on what and how can be done.

Thanks and regards,
V. Natarajan

To add Raja's comments, I'd rather be interested in donating my CPU
cycles for something more productive (say, to empower a cluster that
might help GPS tracking, weather forecast, rural education, agricultural
infrastructure or anything more practical) than wasting it to help some
research project which _can_ be dubious, and merely pointless. Is it so
important for us to establish alien contact at all (i.e., even if it stands to
be practically possible - which I personally doubt) when we (human race)
have so much to do, in order to progress towards our own stability and
sustainability for the generations to come ?

I'm not that good in Linux to answer your question, but would tell you that
whenever I try accessing the CD from KDE desktop in RH9, it hangs... and I
am not able to take out the CD. Nothing happens and the system remains as if
I didn't do anything. No effect even through commands in CLI....the system
keeps on blinking...I usually restart to get the CD-drive detected and then
eject to get the CD back in full shape. There is no problem when I access
files in CD from Gnome...Is there some problem in the installation?
Sounds crazy...One desktop works while another doesn't (on the same system)

Are there any other projects can steal CPU cycles like SETI...?

Just curious....?

There   _was_   a  Genome@Home   program   from   Stanford.  i   think
gah.stanford.edu or something. But dunno if it exists now.

... and AFAIK it isn't open sourced.

http://www.distributed.net/ does something similar... but for a
different purpose altogether. I'm sure thare are many others (A search
on google lists quite a lot of them).

Of course, a couple of Windows worms are programmed to do what SETI does
technically... but with bad intent - use your resources and CPU cycles
to perform a DDoS attack on a victim host (from the internet) on a
trigger.

While the intent of their project seems good, I would've happily donated
my CPU cycles if they were kind enough to distribute their client
application under GPL or other open source license. If they aren't going
to release their application sources to public, there's no reason for me
to trust them or their application.

While the motive of their project seems good, I'm not comfortable
letting their _closed source_ application making use of my CPU cycles
for doing their work. I would've happily installed their application and
let it run on my machine, if they had released it under the GPL or other
open source license. If they aren't willing to release the sources of
their application, there's no reason for me to trust them or their
application.

i fully agree with Mr. Raja
i was having SETI on my system in the year of 1999- 2000 ,
because of the said reasons , i have discontinued after 6 months

it is true that, i lost my Hard Disk and got Heavy Electricity Bill

Doesn't the drive have an eject button ;-)

Seriously though... what happens if u mount /dev/hdb directly? 
i.e. change fstab from

Subject: [Ilugc] issues with samba mount
Message-ID: <eaac783a04092920074ffd3932@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone:

I am having some trouble mounting a samba share.

This is the line from /etc/fstab:

//samba.bii.a-star.edu.sg/deepak /mnt/sambashare smbfs
credentials=/root/.smbpass,uid=1000,gid=100,rw 0 0

uid and gid refer to the normal user login on my machine (running on SuSE 9.1)

Directory /mnt/sambashare mounts with correct permissions, but
everything within that directory mounts with userid set to 2177.

The result is that I can create files within /mnt/sambashare but not
within any subdirectories. A brief listing:

deepak@ip4-138-v345:/mnt/sambashare> ls -la
total 6815748
drwxr-xr-x  1 deepak users  4096 2004-09-29 14:56 ./
drwxr-xr-x  3 root   root     80 2004-09-09 17:04 ../
-rw-------  1   2177 users   532 2004-09-27 17:25 .bash_history
-rw-r--r--  1   2177 users    14 2004-09-02 14:27 .bash_profile
-rw-r--r--  1   2177 users    14 2004-09-02 14:27 .bashrc
-rwxr--r--  1   2177 users  8009 2004-09-17 10:12 commoncode.py*
[snip]


Any idea how to fix this?

Thanks,

Deepak.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0409300427260.16768@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,
Some time back, there was only Win98 in my machine.
I installed redhat Linux 7.2  in the Windows Filesystem itslef(FAT32).
That is, without creating any separate partition for Linux. The whole
Linux would  sit as a large single file in Windows and that large file can
be seen  through the Windows explorer itself. If I want to load Linux, I
will  insert the boot floppy of  linux(which I created during
installation). Otherwise the system will load Windows 98.

Presently I have a system with 40 gb hard disk and windows 2000 loaded in
it. The hard disk is partitioned as 4gb, 18 gb and 18 gb. (The filesystem
is NTFS in windows 2000 I guess).

I want to install any distro of linux in the current machine which has got
windows 2000.The problem is that, I cannot and dont want to repartition my
hard disk(Dont want to use third party tools like partition magic too).

So, I want to install linux with / in windows 2000 as  I had installed
with the machine which was having Win98(As in the first paragraph of this
mail).

I think most of the distros does not support to be installed in NTFS
partition.

If anybody knows any distro which can be installed as a single large file
in Win 2000 and can be booted through floppy disk(without modifying master
boot record) please tell me.

(Correct me if any of my understanding is wrong).

Thanks and regards

  I don't think it could have been RedHat 7.2 - this was probably Xandros
or Lindows or something similar.

  It can't be done, NTFS is not write-safe in Linux. So there's no way that
the booted Linux system can write data back into the NTFS partition. You can
probably cook up a initrd-based, ramdisk-only
distro that can be booted using loadlin.exe from Windows, but it's still
going to be 3 or 4 files, and will only work from 95/98/ME if at all. You
can probably pack all of the files into a self-extracting executable to
make it a single-file executable, but it's a huge compromise on
functionality. Any changes that you make still can't be saved on a ramdisk-
only distro.

 Instead of all this, you can simply use Knoppix and boot from CDROM each
time.

Most likely it was Mandrake 7.2. It somewhat resembled RedHat's distro
back then, with support for installation on the Windows (FAT) partition
itself.

Ok - I really couldn't make much sense of that article - but the general
premise seems to be that MSN Bot is crashing open source sites by spidering
them..or something like that. Err..I thought it was a spider and that was it
was supposed to do. A little bit of googling on MSN Bot would tell you that

- Its in beta. You cannot view the results yet(techpreview.search.msn.com
comes up now and then when they have a new release)

- A bit of googling on webmaster forums would also show that webmasters
grudgingly accept that the MSN Bot is pretty polite and follows robots.txt
religiously..and also supports extra directives where you (the webmaster)
can specify how frequently you should be crawled


But the article does deserve some reading - I've been reading it for 15 mins
and still can't make sense of it. A good example is the following para 

<quote>
..One of the things I have discovered about Microsoft is how innovative they
can be. In my research and activities, I have uncovered some remarkable
things about a lot of companies and people. Would you find it surprising if
some open source advocates were on the payrolls of commercial companies?
What about discovering that all those articles about MSN search technology
competing with Google simply gave MSN a search bot for manipulating the
knowledge base of the Internet? The question is strictly one of conjecture;
just a question for the sake of argument and to stimulate discussion about
things people can do with technology..
</quote>

Huh?

Sorry,

The linux I installed in my Win98 machine was PCQLinux7.1(which was
released around June 2001).I am sure it was not Xandros or Lindows or
mandrake.

I can now try Knoppix. But now I would like to experiment kernel
compilation.(upgrading from lower version to kernel 2.6). So I dont
want to run from CD.

Thanks and regards,

Apologize for posting using company ID. (The journalist in me couldn't resist)

Agreed article isn't great piece, but the author certainly knows what he was writing.

It's a speculative writing (the "?" in the title is a simple clue) its not a statement nor reporting a fact. Even the question raised on open source advocates is in those lines. 

You folks need to re-visit your reading comprehension skills. Still not clear, well last line from the article sums it all.

<quote>
Of course this is about perception and no one really believes that MSN Bot would be used to manipulate what people read on web searches. Would they?
</quote>

It was really funny to see a post defending MS in reaction to such an (silly) article. Funny because someone can emotionally defend MS (with all those research and forum reference) on a "Parody" kind of Article!

This shows strong beliefs can blind peoples perception!!!

If the driver is for 2.4.x kernel, then you can use it
only for that major version of the kernel. If you want
to write your own Makefile for 2.6, you will have to
modify the driver as well.

As the subject line says, Microsoft's patent on the FAT filesystem
has been overturned by the USPTO on re-examination.

This is good news in embedded space, as well as for users of digicams,
mp3 players, etc., most of which make some use of the FAT filesystem.

A wild guess: You must've tried installing PostgreSQL rpm package that wasn't meant for the SuSE Enterprise 9.0.  Perhaps those packages were meant for Redhat/Mandrake or an older version of SuSE distro.

On the other hand, Microsoft has won patents for double-clicking using
the mouse, and also for the application of the mouse scroll wheel -
which is sad :-(. I heard that they are busy trying to patent anything
that they could lay their hands on, which sounds a bit scary.

 There's too much prior art for double-clicking. As far as the scroll wheel
goes, they're welcome to their patent - I've never used the scroll wheel
on any mouse.

 OTOH, the FAT patent had a lot of potential to be disruptive, because it
would have given them a stranglehold on connecting Digicams and mp3 players
to any PC, as well as on USB flash drives of any kind. That's all history
now.

Could anybody filter these kinda message out that comes with every mail ?

It says that it may contain confidential info ? if the sender does not knoe whether his mail contains a confidential info or not, why should he send the mail at all ?

Is the list at risk ?
