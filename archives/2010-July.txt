Just to be clear, you do know that all desktop effects are optional right ? In 
GNOME go to System->Preferences->Desktop Effects and turn it off. I also 
recommend disabling Nautilus and other desktop 'daemons' 
(System->Preferences->Startup applications) which you might consider unnecessary.

If you /do/ want to change your window manager, I recommend using WindowMaker. 
It is ultra-fast, stable and has /very/ small memory footprint while also being 
very usable (infact if you learn how to customize it, it'll be /very/ hard to 
move away from it).

I speak from experience, I held out against moving to X as primary interface 
till about 2004. I used to work almost 95% of the time on terminal - heading to 
X only for browsing sites which were unusable in firefox (or whatever it was 
called then). I did mail, chat, media all on the cli (and good looking cli too ! 
with SVGATextMode). Then I moved to using WindowMaker which kept me satisfied 
till as recently as early 2009 -- after which i've moved to GNOME, mainly 
because I got tired of making all the 'new' essential stuff like hal/udev/dbus, 
NetworkManager, PulseAudio etc work correctly on WindowMaker.  Of course, i have 
compiz and all other eye candy disabled.

hth,
cheers,

 Hi LUG members,

 I started with Ubuntu 8.04 but never enjoyed GNOME looks so moved to
 KDE till memory hog named KDE 4 came out, even KDE 4.1 was slow on my
 system(512MB RAM, 1.73GHz core duo), so I moved to Xubuntu whose light
 interface runs pretty well on my system apart from the fact that X
 server crashes [~once a week], I verified with other friends using
 Xubuntu that XFCE is not very stable and crashes do occur. (I have no
 intentions to debug or debate why these crashes occur, so I reuqest
 you to please do not debate on that).

 I wonder which releases do LUG members recommend with following four features
 1) User has good enough experience with system(most work is done from
 command line) the only reason to start X server for me is to run
 Firefox and pidgin
 2) Plain interface similar to XFCE but does not crash
 3) Is not memory hog (like KDE 4)
 4) must be fast(user hates compiz and any such flying effects)

 I have heard that archlinux is fast and simple but unstable, any
 comments on that?
 (or may be on BSD based distros?)


   I would recommend Lubuntu, the latest one. My brother uses it on a P4
   machine with 512MB RAM. He is into animation so uses GUI all the time.
   However, it is very stable.

   HTH.

Message-ID: <AANLkTik1Tw9ujVze-saoZg5KHcK2nFeeL5YOj-hJmX3m@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Potrace

What it is:

Potrace(TM) is a utility for tracing a bitmap, which means,
transforming a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image. The input is a
bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP format), and the default output is an
encapsulated PostScript file (EPS). A typical use is to create EPS
files from scanned data, such as company or university logos,
handwritten notes, etc. The resulting image is not "jaggy" like a
bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered at any resolution.

Features:

Mkbitmap is a program distributed with Potrace which can be used to
pre-process the input for better tracing behavior on greyscale and
color images.

To know more about:

If you downloaded a Flash FLV file and want to convert it to an audio

For audio:

ffmpeg -i input.flv -ar 44100 -ab 160 -ac 2 output.mp3

I find ffmpeg to be much powerful than mplayer. Creating thumbnails from
videos etc and also converting them is a breeze.
And also, python binding is available (pyffmpeg)

I m not much familiar with lot of distro, but when it comes about stability
and speed, I prefer Debian...since, it very stable and it also boot
fast....while installing Debian, install it through command line and don't
select any X-window systems components...

Also the the best features in Debian is that, it has a very big repository
which contains more than 20 K packages

Hi,

One of my colleague need to download youtube videos in ".avi" format.
He wants GUI client. (Since he uses xilisoft in M$ Windows)

I tried with Firefox's DownloadHelper Add-on .
It is downloading in .flv format only , eventhough  I choose the  ".avi"
convert option.

I tried with gvdown, but It throws "wrong URL error" for every thing .

Is there any opensource  GUI tool for this ?

There is no GUI client for converting .flv into .avi

But still the solution is

->just copy the youtube video site
Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiMVNwt-8f8&feature=popular

-> then goto www.file2hd.com, check the agree* checkbox* and select
*movies*radio button

-> after pressing *Get Files


-> *and go for convert button.
thats it there u go, all the best.

why mp3 and mpg ???
use Ogg/Ogv

use ffmpeg2theora to convert into open standard format for video and audio.
otherwise you can wait fr ffmpeg2webm release convert it into webm format.

we conducted one workshop there about 3 years back - the staff was very 
supportive - and we regularly conduct workshops in Sri Krishna college. So if

Hi Thaniga,

I think there is a limitation on the sizes the gzip can handle.

http://www.gzip.org/#faq10 says otherwise. Is that not the gzip that
is shipped on the distro?

you can also extract it like this

tar  -xzvf  filename.gz

By default this will extract the files in the current directory, if u want
files to be extracted in another dir then use -C option

tar  -xzvf  filename.gz  -C  /path_to_dir

Plz send me the error message, if u are facing any error while extracting. A
cause of error may be occur due to insufficient space in the partition, so
use df -k partition name to find out the partitions used and free space.

Do the h.264 patents even apply in India? If not, use x264 with ffmpeg

Galxo shares 13,500 chemical compounds with public which may be

It won't seek any patents on any malaria drug, but might consider them

Well, guess what ? Galxo didn't just suddenly realize the benefit of an open 
source approach out of the goodness in their heart. They were compelled to do so 
by the people who gave them the research grant. Want to take a wild guess who 
these people are ?

Hi,

Has anyone implemented a paperless office using a workflow management
system. Any recommendations? Trying to see what cuteflow can do now-a-days
but not able to work it out properly.

Suggestions & comments would be very helpful.

Thanks,

Ugh, i hate explaining myself. Did you even bother to see the links I added ?

Well, to spell it out for those who cannot be bothered to read TFAs, Glaxo got 
research funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation on the condition that 
they share the findings of the research. So, Billy boy the hypocrite that he is, 
thinks it is a good idea to share knowledge because it encourages innovation 
...only as long as the sharing doesn't happen from the company that is making 
him millions.

Read about his hypocritical stance:

Both KDE4 and Gnome when mixed with Firefox and Open Office need good
amount of RAM .
You can use KDE3.X which comes as default in debian lenny and is very
stable (to say the least)

*Ubuntu is an unstable distribution and relies heavily on community
feedback in the case of xubuntu its definitely less than ubuntu . Go
for XFCE on Debian( even on testing(currently squeeze) you will it
very stable .

http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/i386/iso-cd/debian-testing-i386-xfce+lxde-CD-1.iso

The baove link is a debian cd1 with basic packages and xfce as desktop .

No sir. Please read the article. The employees don't just use Windows,
they use Mac and Linux as well. Most of them are already using
Firefox, its just that IBM has made it explicit for every workstation
to have Firefox installed along with some other products such as Lotus
/Notes|Sametime|Symphony/

It was surprising that no one is flaming IBM yet. They're not so
friendly to opensource either, in fact before Microsoft was "IT super
power" it was IBM and now its Apple. Funny that we get all heated up
when we hear Microsoft, but forget that Microsoft is not the only
company that is not showing its source.

          o Hierarchical design through user defined modules.
          o Easy to use point-and-click user interface.
          o Create hyperlinks to move about in circuit or load other files.
          o Multi-lingual interface (Catalan, English, French, German,
Japanese, Spanish, Welsh)
          o Verilog-like save file format.
    * Logic simulation
          o Control through the GUI or through script files.
          o Suitable for simulation at transistor, gate or register
transfer level.
          o Six valued logic model including 0, 1, floating, unknown,
"low" and "high".
          o Support for custom delay models.
          o Graphical display of simulation results.
          o Breakpoints, single-step and clock-step simulator control.
          o Static critical path analysis.
    * Primitive circuit elements include:
          o Basic gates (AND, OR, etc.)
          o Switch-level NMOS and PMOS transistors
          o Tristate buffers
          o Alu components (Adders, shifters, multipliers)
          o Memory elements (Registers, RAMs, ROMs)
          o An interactive "tty" element allows design of circuits
that can interact with the user.

Shrinivasan, Prasanth, others,

Sorry to be a distraction - but I need to say this:

Prashanth: I applaud your efforts at trying to organize something for your
college, but you should understand that you are talking to much senior folks
with expertise.

Also, they do not gain *anything* by conducting this workshop - it is for
your college. It would help to show respect to these generous folk whose
intention is to help you with knowledge.

It might be unintentional, but it would help if
- You address people by name/title before you begin the mail
- You call the people who responded and setup the conversation

Being humble helps - am hoping you dont mean to be rude, and these are
unintentional.

A proactive person like you has a bright future - consider these as learning
:)

In your best interests,
Madan.

If it is VLB Janakiammal College in Coimbatore, Raman, Kenneth and I 
visited the college few years ago and conducted a 2 day workshop. Raman 
should be able to provide the contact person we had there there, but 
IIRC we did it for MCA department.

Hi Prasath,
   I did the same last year when i was a final year student.Ilugc supported 
very well and they did the workshop very well (Mr.RaviJaya took a two day 
session about python,php and Open source).
  As Shrini sir told prepare all the things one by one.And taking care of the 
ilugc members is so important.Because they are doing all these just for 
us.REMEMBER THAT.Ask the students to learn the basics before the workshop.
I am willing to guide you on this as i just finished my college i can 
understand your needs.
              All the very best.
                                           With regards,
                                               Balachandar.K.M

Friends.

We are in the need of volunteers to handle sessions
on VLB Engg College.

We have to decide on the dates.

Please reply here if you are interested to handle any session.
Add your name, email id, interested topic.

Once, if we prepared the list of volunteers,
we can talk to the college people for the other facilities.

It will be an excellent team work, again.

Thanks.

Do you mean "report generation" from a BI perspective? If so, search for
"open source business intelligence" or "open source report generation".
JasperReports and Pentaho come to mind. The former is free, while the latter
is rather commercial, but both are open source. I have used Pentaho and
found it to be a "good (open source) reporting tool" :) You could also check
EclipeBIRT out.

Can you elaborate on what you mean by a "reporting tool" for "opensource
applications"?


Cheers,
KD.

he wants to be pointed to a particular open source application so that he can 
develop his  own reporting tool. Of course this is re inventing the wheel - 
but if mankind has not been re-inventing the wheel for thousands of years, we 
would only have one type of wheel and we would not have progressed.

Message-ID: <AANLkTilMgVbA0eMsupYT1nhl2_wd2kp_i7FLkNUqVVU8@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Balazar

What it is:

Balazar is a solo or multiplayer adventure/action game, taking place
in a 3D fantasy world, with RPG-like dialogs, puzzles, and fights.

Plot:
  More than a thousand years ago, the three Gods that have created the
world became too powerful for the poor mortals. Then the Elves forged
three magical scepters to   control the Gods, and the Gods were
imprisoned in the magical crystal of Arkanae (during Arkanae I).

  Though the secret of the Elven blacksmiths has not been lost as time
goes on, monsters and powers are coming back. New scepters have been
reforged, giving birth to new Gods. But who can find the scepters and
imprison them in the Arkanae, or free them for ever by dropping the
scepters in the Abyss ? Who can judge the Gods ?

  You'll have to find your way through the 7 worlds : the Echassian
village, the Pompon forest, the great cathedral, the ice desert, the
Arkanae citadel, the Abyss swamp and finally the Elven Forge, to find
the scepters and write a new destiny for the Universe !

It is not as black and white however.  For example,  they hold the
largest number of software patents in the world and continue to strongly
lobby for expanding the scope of patenting in the world.   They even
argued to the Supreme court in US that software patents benefit free and
open source software.

nothing is black and white - take yahoo!, they contribute their satellite 
images freely to openstreetmap, release a lot of the code they write into open 
source and happily patent a lot of software. There is an old english proverb 
'he who lives in a glass house should undress in the dark'. If we apply the 
principle of only black and white, very few if anyone on this list qualifies to 
be here. (certainly I do not). But let us be reasonable - there is a huge 
amount of 'white' in IBM which is thus much higher on the side of the good 
guys than microsoft. Of course Redhat is almost pure white on the scale.

let people who use fully free software on their mobiles, who do not touch 
google apps, who only use non-patented hardware flame IBM. Let the rest of us 
keep our peace.

Although I could argue about some specific points here, my point was not
about purity but simply that we need to continue to keep a critical eye
on who we consider friends of free software.

One example of IBM contribution to Open Source is eclipse.

To give credit to IBM, they made eclipse fully open sourced. They fund
a lot of Linux and java-based opensource projects.
More particularly they funded CouchDB, which was developed by Damien
Katz, ex-IBM employee who worked on Lotus Notes team which is a
similar document based DB. They have a list of projects to which they
claim that they're contributing:
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/opensource/projects.jsp

But, lets not be blatant in embracing IBM as the good guys shall we.
As Rahul pointed out, IBM has more patents than any other software
company in the world and they do use that patents against open source
projects:
http://www.computerworlduk.com/community/blogs/index.cfm?entryid=2891&blogid=14
http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2010/04/ibm-breaks-taboo-and-betrays-its.html

Any guess why they threatened that particular open source project?:
Because the project is a *mainframe* emulator.

I can argue that IBM going open source is only a tactical business
decision to oust Microsoft and Sun (now Oracle) in the enterprise
space. --> http://www.zdnet.com/news/open-source-ibms-deadly-weapon/296366
, but it is a no-brainer isn't it.

My point is not "don't just hate Microsoft, hate IBM too" - It is to
be diligent in whom we consider as good, and whom we consider as evil
for FOSS and always be wary of big corporate companies and their
hidden agenda.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimexfak_ChL7alp_SwbaKXz5IgX4DiTfwdOxLjs@mail.gmail.com>

This is an interesting article about the list of most powerful voices
in Open Source.

http://www.mindtouch.com/blog/2010/03/17/mpv/

The top 10 are:
1.Tim OReilly - Founder of OReilly Media
2. Linus Torvalds - developer, Linux Kernel
3. Chris Messina - Open Source advocate (known for his involvement in
helping to create the BarCamp, Spread Firefox, and coworking
movements)
4. Jonathan Schwartz - ex-CEO, Sun Microsystems
5. Miguel de Icaza - developer, GNOME and Mono projects
6. Glenn Hilton -  CEO of ImageX Media. Mac-using, social
media-loving, open source enthusiast
7. Glyn Moody - known for his book 'Rebel Code: Linux and the Open
Source Revolution'
8. Matt Asay - populat CNET Blogger
9. Dries Buytaert - original product lead for Drupal
10. Guido van Rossum - author of Python

Though a bit controversial since RMS is nowhere in the top 50 list.
Maybe because they've used Twitter and Google sites and not identi.ca
or maybe genuinely there is no buzz around him in social networks and
blogosphere.

Hi,

Did you check the hardware drivers program to see if you need any
proprietary drivers?

I have not seen anything this small.   Soekris,  PC Engines, Beagle
boards come with a close to full fledged functionality in sandwich box
form factor.

Can you share the application you have in mind for this kind of device?

Hello Shrini,

I would like to take this opportunity and share my experience.

Title : Open Talk - From Proprietary to Open source

*Back Ground: *


   - 10 years of experience in IT.
   - Worked in top tier Consulting company
   - Consulted on implementation of CRM products to various government
   agencies and corporates.
   - Worldwide implementation of  SAP, Siebel ( Now part of Oracle),
   MicroSoft technologies ( Microsoft Project Server) and Java packaged
   application for IT Governance ( Now part of HP)


What made a hardcore proprietary consultant to Open Source?


Let's meet on July 10th to know why?

Thanks,

Senthil

Reporting tools are the class of tools that specialize in only one
thing - Reporting. it can generate reports in PDF, Email, HTML, CSV,
charts, etc.The underlying principle  is that all the data required is
available as-is in the database, and the developer has made a
template. The end user "invokes" this report to get it with the latest
data. You can think of a SQL view versus a normal SQL Query. Hence,
reporting tools are generally coupled with BI (Business Intelligence)
and Data Warehousing (DWH) softwares.

To answer the original question: My first choice would be Jasper
Reports for web applications and Eclipse BRIT framework for a local
setup.

HTH,
Natarajan.

The one i asked is, there are many opensource applications which lacks
in functinality of reporting, say for example some network monitoring
tools may lack in web based reporting etc. I need some suggetion of
such application so that i can involve in development of that thing.

Dear Srinivasan 
Thankyou for the book link
I was expecting a book like this

Why we did not make a book of this kind ?
I am in this  list for the past 8 years.
I observer only few books are made by this list members [ Linux learning, command ref and Tamil version of The Cathedral and the Bazaar ,Do not ask me "why you did not write a book ?". because, i am still in learning process.]

Do not take my comments into your heart

Have a nice day

Thiagu

I have started freelancing and in the process of building a network of
persistant support structure for SME-s, Educational institutions etc.

Well I am about to start experimenting HPC and Cloud and the combo thereoff.

I am located in Mumbai (specifically Thane -- similar to
taramani/tambaram only that Thane is is in the north of Mumbai and
others are in the south of Chennai "Central")

I am going to experiment from 2000Hrs to 0800 Hrs wherein I am
planning to implement HPC using COTS desktops. I can't guarantee any
100% success (or or that matter even 1% success) as Desktops do not
have "in-band" fencing device and "out of band" fencing is not an
option due to cost.

With about 10 desktops.

"Out-of-band" fencing device will cost me about may be 100k on the
upper end. I don't have anywhere that kind of fund at this point of
time to spend.

So forget 24x7 Secure Industrial strength, Trusted and most
importantly on demand available cloud.

I can't pay you money as I am looking forward to at least one order
which will cover my costs and stay afloat with my monthly family
requirement of funds.

But I would expect you to pay me "gurudakshina" and other issues --
unfortunately, the fallout of open source.

I will try to get accomodation at nominal student rate and food at my
home ay most. I can't afford anything else at this point of time. *Of
course _lots_ of conditions (behavorial, financial, etc, etc,) apply.

Trust has to be deined openly.

Somebody has to value my knowledge and provide sufficient funds to pay
the bills.

About me: I have three years Experiece in digital and analog
experience in Industrial electorincs followed by almost 27 years in
core and captive IT industry -- For profit and non Profit -- (Core --
revenue streams purely through employment in organisations whose
revenues are purely IT based; Captive: Organisations whose revenue
stram is NOT IT based -- manufacturing, Construction, Retailers,
Educational instirutions etc.)

I have sorta fathered, mothered and nurtured and still nurturing may
infratructures which have had a longevity of of about 13 years of
production use with batrely 5% of carrying cost of the original cost
Per Annum.

I can't give you a certificate as I am yet to obtain my BCA from IGNOU
though I am eligible for IGNOU MCA admission -- stalled due to the
warpwed market conditions and my personal health problems. You will
have to fid a a respected guide for the signature to "bless" your
project by some degree holders. (sigh! India is how fulll of too much
of graduates and worse still PHB MBAs who clutch to their degrees --
which incidentally are (often) wrong perceptions)

So you can see I have very little to offer.

Except possibily a share of my (now dead -- hence  past experiences)

I could not get access to required hardware at affordable cost (as on
date for me) on rental basis for my experiment.

In case you want my guidance you will have to pay me some openly
agreed upon amount.

I will communicate further if you are interested.

Some (many) more conditions apply.

Oh! how I wish to construct the HPC on cloud to "N" number of
biometric and other

If you want *REAL* cloud, point me to the place where the correct
hardware is ther or allow it to be developed _AND_ they will *pay* me
for KT  (knowledge Transfer).

HTH,

Regards,

Rajagopal

PS: and oh! brush up on SELinux on Centos and report me the progress
in the next mail.

I came across this comment from one of the hurd developers on this
topic. I thought it would be interesting to share here
http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1474941

"Later, as mentioned in other comments here, the ECGS fork of GCC
caused issues - ultimately leading to the displacement of an FSF
appointed project leader. There is some back story to that. The
company Cygnus (later acquired by Red Hat, founded by M. Tiemann et
al.) had been advertising to customers that not only could they
develop customized extensions to GCC, but that they could shepherd
those extensions into the "official releases". There was frustration
at Cygnus and some other firms that the FSF branch was not merging
these changes quickly enough or was arguably being too prickly about
the nature of the changes. As nearly as I can tell those sentiments
led to the ECGS fork and RMS was ultimately put in the position of
having to choose between "blessing" that fork or simply losing any
claim at all to the future of GCC."

Hi

Has anyone used/come across open source mass email software(ideally 
desktop client) ? I am involved with a not for profit organization where 
I am recommending them to move towards Linux and was looking for such a 
software for their use.

Application: OpenKM

OpenKM is a document management system with a web user interface that
allows easy management of documents, users, roles and finding your
enterprise documents and records.

Why use a Document Management System ?

Enterprises get a lot of documents, images and other information in
electronic formats. One of the great time consumers of an organization
is end user information location.

On the enterprise intranet, users store documents in folders on their
hard disk. Nobody knows the information stored in all the enterprise
and which information is needed.

Features:

    * Web 2.0
    * Drag and drop
    * Document control version
    * Powerful search engine
    * LDAP or DBMS integration
    * Webservices API
    * Store on any DBMS
    * More than 26 languages
    * WebDAV
    * Workflow
    * OCR
    * Reports
    * Thesaurus
    * Tag cloud
    * Automatic key extraction

GMail has several throttles to ensure users don't abuse the system.
If you send out mass emails through GMail, your account is bound to
get locked.  I suggest that you do not use GMail without knowing its
limits.


To the OP: try Thunderbird's Mail Tweaks extension.  It's got a
Personalized Email feature which can mass mail and is easy enough
for end users to use.

That link is just an example of how we can give a solution
to the organization.

you should modify the script to use their own mail server.

As Raja said, gmail has limits.
Try the Thunderbird option too.

Hi,

AFAIK, in the past we have not cancelled or rescheduled meet on
account of any parallel events (Correct me if i am wrong).LUG meet
always tend to be a information feast and certainly a camp for
developers, admin ,technicians and public.My request to the admin is,
please do not disturb our standard practice of meeting on second
saturday on account of any parallel meet, further we have hardly 60+
days before software freedom day and we need to plan for it.

I want to finally give in & do my RHCE certification but have a few

* Are these vouchers enough for me to get the necessary discount or am

Hi Senthil,

I have been playing with selenium for a while now. Created a simple
test case got it working in IE, FF on windows and FF, safari, opera on
mac. I have to figure out how it interacts with cucumber.  I would be
interested in meeting up with people who are working on selenium. I am
based in bangalore though.

Thanks Deepan. It's great to know that you had your own initiative to learn
and practice it.

For our Project in Chennai,we plan to use Selenium as a testing tool. The
development environment is used with Eclispse, PHP, MySQL with ZEND
framework.

Let's meet with like minded people to form a team!

Update: The hardware I could get does not have VMX flag in the CPU.

So as of now, I would put Cloud for the second phase of my experimentation.

Alternatively the people who want to join me can bring their own
motherboards and after the finish of project they can use it for their
purpose.

Those interested please check with me for the Motherboard specs.

If you are using Xen, this is not a big problem unless you want
to run Windows. You can still run fully paravirtualized kernels
like Linux, FreeBSD, OpenSolaris, etc, without any hardware VT
support.

See the Xen paravirtualization docs for the details.

Really a good interview.

*Question 3a)* We at ILUGC revolve around engineering college predominantly,
I am sure you will agree that, innovative and inspirational minds stays in
engg polytechnics, arts and science college too

Yes, we everyone agree on the above, all the innovative and inspirational
minds stays in polytechnics and arts and science colleges.  There is an Arts
& science college for Women in Madurai,  Polytechnics in Thanjavur/Namakkal,
were they almost exclusively use only Linux/FOSS for most of the lab
practicals, which was implemented and supported by us since 2007.  (There is
more Linux/FOSS in polytechnics, arts and science colleges than in
engineering colleges).

how do we fill this digital divide?

We need to have a foundation/society like "Free Software Society of India",
were we can pull all these educational institutions towards "Free /Open
Source Software" to fill this digital divide.

How exactly is this FOSS? Or at least linux related?

Besides that, I am sorry I do not know of such a tool. Perhaps you
should check the IT site for that. nic.in?

Use GNU/Emacs . In emacs there is command to open a shell . Once
inside the shell ( the shell is running inside emacs) all indic
scripts come out fine .
Some emacs tips at http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs_fun.html


Broken rendering is due to the way the engine draws characters . The
gnome-terminal and konsole unfortunately couldn't display complex
indic characters .

The same problem is occurred when we tried apt-get update in that

Looks like Packages.bz2 is corrupt or partially downloaded. Try deleting it
from the apt-proxy cache on the server and it will be auto downloaded the
next time your run apt-get run on your client machines.

Just a piece of advice, never ever use ultrasurf. It does lot of suspicious
stuff http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/073109-blackhat-ultrasurf.html
. You can use tor/vidalia instead https://www.torproject.org/vidalia/ .

What specifically do you want to change?  If you are more clear about

Yes. Expression Engine a commercial CMS is based on CodeIgniter.

There is a trade-off here, you can avoid re-inventing wheel with framework
but you need to spend time on learning.

Unfortunately no framework provides everything that you would need for your
project.

Why would you want to recompile the kernel for this?  If you are just
looking for a howto on remastering a distribution,  refer to

I am even assuming that you just want to change the look and feel ,
for which you don't need to change the kernel or even the distro .

All you need to do is change the theme , wallpaper, login screen and a
custom boot splash screen . That would be your xyz linux !

If you want the changes to be in a CD , then go for Distro remastering
link given by Rahul sundaram .

some other distros .

Pretty meaningless statement.  There are multiple implementations and
several technologies involved.  Be more specific on what you want to

Cloud computing is a very broad definition for doing things on the
Network be it in your private network or hosted by a provider on the
'Net.

What is it that you want to implement in a cloud computing?  You need
to define your functional requirements and then look for a solution.
>From the wording of your query  your requirements are not clear at
all.

If you really want to learn the nuts and bolts of cloud computing,
then I would suggest that you first start with understanding what is
virtualization.  Again, for which there are many solutions to name a
few: The Linux KVM, Xen, VMware ...

> and also please send me the configuration details of dns in linux

What have you done up to now to setup DNS in your network?  If
nothing, then please read up first on how DNS works and then on BIND9,
there are plenty of good docs on the 'Net on both topics.  IMO, one
needs to have a basic understanding of how DNS works before any
attempts on setting up it up.

Hi,

We found that the apt-proxy cache is corrupted in the repository
machine and we deleted that. Now apt-get update is working fine.
Thanks to all

Now, let's not confuse you. Cloud computing *is* like the others on the
thread said, well, such a broad term. It's like using resources like, cpu,
network, storage over the Internet [i.e. They should be accessible over
Internet protocols] and you get billed only for what you use and for the
amount of time that you use it for.

E.x. You launch an instance (a virtual computer lying somewhere on the
"cloud") and let's say you run it for 2 hours, you get billed for running it
for 2 hours and for the processor, ram etc.

To implement it on a local infrastructure, you'll need to get your hands on
some of the "Cloud Computing Framework". Open source ones are easier to get.
Eucalyptus is one popular framework. You then need to try and implement each
component on the framework.

What you need, at least two servers, one preferably VT-enabled (meaning you
can run virtual machines) to run the essential components and a good
Internet connection.

You can find a beginner's guide here: http://cssoss.wordpress.com

Pick up the keywords and google them if you don't understand. Or just ask
your questions here, but not before you've done some background work
(googling, reading guides, forums etc).

Cheers,
Yogesh.

I tried using the "public dns" (that's wat they call it) from the browser.

If your regex engine doesn't work in multiline mode, then this won't
really work since GNU Mailman searches a giant string containing all
headers. Try '\nSubject' instead.

It's in the documentation:

project engineers are not allowed to speak on behalf of NRC-FOSS - but senior 
staff will certainly both take responsibilities and speak.

In this case, this part of the syllabus was not an NRC-FOSS initiative. It has 
been drafted by the BOS of Anna University who had taken some feedback from 
some of us. As such NRC-FOSS had made no commitments regarding the portal. The 
delay in replying to this is due to the fact that NRC-FOSS is a large project 
run by 7 different institutions and we had to check with all of them and our ex 
staff members to ascertain whether we had any role in this matter. That said, 
we are now discussing with AU as to whether we can play a role to support this 
initiative, and also we are quite willing to host any support materials that 
luggies can provide.

Appreciate the effort. Let us hope, the effort will come to the right target soon.

If it is possible, you may provide more info here about who are the other institutions, AUKBC-NRCFOSS role, Other's role, current structure of NRCFOSS,.etc. So that they can understand the complete structure/processes and avoid the controversies in future anything relevant to NRCFOSS. Hope your infos may stop the controversy between LUGGIES and NRCFOSS.

You are asking about Software to 'manage' , he is suggesting something to

Cut down the annoying number of redundant question marks and try
googling for the terms before asking such questions.

Dear Friends,

Mr.Parin Sharma conducted FOSS workshop in school at Delhi.

Is there any school running under FOSS in Chennai or Tamil Nadu?

Shall we try to promote FOSS in  chennai schools ?

The following mail content is sent by Parin Sharma to iitdlug

Subject: [LUG@IITD:8406] Back to my Alma mate with FOSS!!
To: iitdlug@googlegroups.com, posterous@lug-iitd.posterous.com


Recently on 30th June 2010, I got an opportunity to give back
something to my school, my Alma mate with FOSS !! Below is a small
story how things started and went....

I?had this thing in my mind for quite some time, schools are the
places where we are taught basic morals, etiquette, sharing things,
knowledge and other good things but unfortunately most of the Schools
in India teach Proprietary software like MS Windows, Office and other
Adobe stuff like Flash etc. so was the case with my school, DAV
CPS[1], Paschim Enclave, New Delhi. So I talked to Anand Wardhan sir,
one of the best teachers, I have met in my life!! Although, he is an
Economics teacher but still he understood my point when I told him
about FOSS Stuff and he immediately agreed for a workshop in School.
So it was 30th June, the day I was eagerly waiting for but was a bit
nervous too because it was for teachers!! OMG, now I had to present
something to teachers to who taught me some years back but I knew it
will be good!! So it was 11:45, and I started, first telling about
FOSS history and then its advantages, then SchoolOS[2] but since I had
just 1hr or so, I had to quickly jump to the Demo Educational
FOSS....I started with Maths S/w like Kig then showed Chemistry tools
and I tried to show almost every subject related FOSS but as always I
fell short of time and had to wind up my presentation showing FET and
Dia Diagram Editor, but as a start, it was enough, the teachers were
all smiling, blessing me!! It was a wonderful experience.... many
teacher in particular my chem teacher asked me to install BKChem and
other chem S/w asap because she found them really helpful! Overall it
was awesome but this is not it, I want things to get implemented asap,
want students and teachers to use FOSS!! Looking forward to it...All I
wanna tell everyone reading this, seriously its a beautiful experience
doing something for your school, your people!! Try it this summer go
back to your previous schools and tell them about Freedom that you get
when you use FOSS, so that the next gen coming can live in a pure Free
World!

You can use VtigerCRM for this.

It has products module with some default fields.
you can add your required fields to that.

In sales order module, you can generate bills.

It will be a perfect suite for your requirement.

Although that might not be /exactly/ what your friend might need, it should be a 
good starting point. Basically integrating a library management software with a 
CRM workflow would give you what you need.

what controversy is this? the relevant links for the above have been given and 
only those who did not bother to read the links have any doubts. As mentioned 
before, there is a lot of symbiosis between NRC-FOSS	 and the LUGs - we work 
very well together. For example this page reads like a whois of active LUG

Could we start by approaching Government schools in Chennai and take

I wanted to know if there is any site which would provide  FOSS and Linux

There are many ways to accomplish this without ssh passwordless login.

I use a tool called rdiff-backup. You can either NFS mount the
partition from the remote machine or install the
same version of rdiff-backup on the remote machine and do a network
backup. The other thing to do would
 be installing duplicity in which case you will need ssh login or you
could even avoid it if you use ftp or http
with duplicity.

Dear all,

On behalf of ILUGC, myself conducted a one day awareness program on FOSS in
J.J. College of engineering and technology, Near Trichy for the 2nd year
CSE, IT and MCA students totalling 250+.

Topics covered:

Why Free / Open Source Software so important in engineering education
Ubuntu 10.04 installation from DVD
Introduction to office, internet, multimedia tools
Development tools in FOSS
Big Buck Bunny/sixth sense technology movie

It was also decided to setup 3 separate FOSS labs for each dept. and
do their further practicals in GNU/Linux.

They are also interested in conducting FOSS workshops for MCA/ME
departments.

I would like to thank Director Dr. V.Shanmuganathan, Principal Dr.
V.Sivaramakrishnan, HODs of CSE/IT/MCA for the support in organizing the
program.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikhcUjBJ0t1scj7fNEFdh98BW1s96m7Z_1xOTLF@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Today Chennai hosted its first ever DevCamp in ThoughtWorks office. We
had a good turnout - around 125 external audience and another 30
people within the company which includes me. We had topics related to
Amazon Cloud (AWS), Google Cloud (GAE), Google Big Table, HTML5 & CSS3
(by Opera developer), Continuous Integration & TDD, Text Mining,
Design Patterns, Robotics through OpenSource hardware (!),  JSONP,
Introduction to Scala, Refactoring and code smells, Scaling AWS cloud
and some more.

Thanks to Shrinivasan T, who took a session on "Making money out of
OpenSource software" (I hope i got the title right) and I met few
other members of ILUG-C such as Arulalan, Shiv Deepak. A big hi &
sorry to other ILUG-C members who came but whom I couldn't meet -
Vatsala was one among them I guess.

Some of them had to leave for ILUG-C's monthly meet. Hopefully you
guys can participate for the whole day for the next DevCamp - which
might happen sooner than we expect :)

Thanks,
Balaji

 Hi all,

 Today Chennai hosted its first ever DevCamp in ThoughtWorks office. We
 had a good turnout - around 125 external audience and another 30
 people within the company which includes me. We had topics related to
 Amazon Cloud (AWS), Google Cloud (GAE), Google Big Table, HTML5 & CSS3
 (by Opera developer), Continuous Integration & TDD, Text Mining,
 Design Patterns, Robotics through OpenSource hardware (!),  JSONP,
 Introduction to Scala, Refactoring and code smells, Scaling AWS cloud
 and some more.

 Thanks to Shrinivasan T, who took a session on "Making money out of
 OpenSource software" (I hope i got the title right) and I met few
 other members of ILUG-C such as Arulalan, Shiv Deepak. A big hi &
 sorry to other ILUG-C members who came but whom I couldn't meet -
 Vatsala was one among them I guess.

 Some of them had to leave for ILUG-C's monthly meet. Hopefully you
 guys can participate for the whole day for the next DevCamp - which
 might happen sooner than we expect :)

 Thanks,
 Balaji

Dear Friends,

It is said to be one of the biggest meet of ilugc in recent times, 67
members came for the meet, yes, you heard it right, I repeat the number, it
is '67'.

Chandrasekhar Babu started with his talk on mariadb and explained about
optimising the db and explained features of Maria DB.
Senthil Kumar gave a talk on his experience of getting converted to open
source business model.
FSFTN Speaker Siddharth, taken the presentation on the preambles of Free
Software Movement.
Raman taken class for System administration.

The session went  over for three and half hours continuously.I request the
co-ordinator to post the agenda at least one week in advance, this will
facilitate for the members  to plan better.

regards,
Thyagarajan Shanmughm

Hi,
I am joining aerospace engineering in IIT Madras this year. I plan to buy a
desktop PC for college use.
I was wondering what specifications to look for eg. whether to go for a 32
bit or 64 bit machine, what video card to get, etc.
Thank you.

Hi Guys,

I installed gnokii and it's GUI front end Gnocky in fedora 13. When I try to
identify my phone using gnokii, it is successfully showing my model.

But, when I fired up 'Gnocky' it is giving me a 'Connection Broken' error. I
also configured it's preferences as in 'gnokii'.

Any one tried 'Gnocky' ? Any workarounds?

'gnokii --identify' command gives me the mobile phone model & IMEI number.

But, when I tried to download SMS it is giving me error:
"
 Received message type 00
 GetSMS ME 1 failed! (Unknown error - well better than nothing!!)
 Serial device: closing device

"
>From the gnokii Getting Started page[
http://www.gnokii.org/docs.shtml#nk3810 ] I get to know that, sending SMS in
my model is not so stable.

So, I installed 'Wammu', which is a similar package for mobile phone
management. I created settings for my phone using the wizard. After that I
can retrieve the contacts, but still can't read messages. When I retrive
messages from Retrive--> Messages menu, nothing shows up. I'm using USB
cable to connect my phone.

So, I take a look at supported models, http://wammu.eu/phones/nokia/2086/ ,
http://wammu.eu/phones/nokia/3443/ , http://wammu.eu/phones/nokia/1049/

The documentation is specifiying that, messaging feature can't be accessed
by connecting via USB. So, I'm planning to buy a Bluetooth Dongle for my PC,
and then connect via it.

Hope it will work!

cool - largest I remember was 45 or so in 2007. If we can find the reason for 
the attendance, then we can replicate it. can we find out why people attended 
this meeting? The reasons could be:

a. coincidence - it so happened that many people were free that day so they 
came

or

b. a particular talk attracted them - I suspect this is a main reason and I 
think it would have been talk number 1. I know many lug members are into 
mysql, and if this was the main reason for the crowd, then we must find more 
subjects that people will hunger to know

or

c.  It was talk no 4 - if so, we should continue this series with a planned 
structure

or

d. those who attended devcamp managed to drag a part of the audience to the 
LUG meet - if so, we must hold devcamp/barcamp/whatever every morning on 
second saturday

it will be interesting if those who attended gave their reason/s for attending

Hi, Vikram,

These questions will be better answered on forums like TechEnclave.com
<http://www.techenclave.com/pc-buying-advice/> and Erodov.com
<http://www.erodov.com/forums/hardware-zone/core-components/>. Pretty
much the only thing you'll have to worry about for Linux compatibility
are graphics cards (since you won't be needing wi-fi).

For graphics cards: Nvidia has always been the way to go if you want
best performance since their closed-source drivers work most of the
time.

I have an ATI 4670 and an Nvidia 8800 GT though, and the 4670 has out of
the box 3D acceleration in the latest version of Ubuntu (and probably
also other modern distros) with free drivers so radeonhd has come quite
a way. Both of these work fine, though. Other people also report that a
low-end ATI 4350 works with free drivers:
<http://vizzzion.org/blog/2010/06/epic-moment-free-and-fast-graphics-at-last/>.

Good luck,

+1 for netbook, especially if you're traveling often (and quite cheap). 
But the keyboard & screen can be tiny, and it's not fun when you have to 
code on it for a long time. Seriously reconsider the netbook if you're 
an Emacs user - the keyboard can give you an ulcer if you have big hands 
- I have to use vim on my netbook for coding.

Vamsee.

mobile, I tried with Sony Ericsson W 700i and it worked well.
May be hardware problem, contact gnokii support for this at #gnokii in irc.

 Soon the Trend will go from netbook to Smartphone.
http://maboot.com/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-nexus-one-tutorial/653/
Smartphone = computing + communication.
I guess, soon they will be used as ThinClients where you enters into office
and your thin-client (smartphone) will boot. At the similar pattern
companies will provide OS on Clould which you will be able to boot from
wifi/Wmax connection. SO just carry one smartphone and do your computing any
where.

It might not be possible to do date arithmetic using simple formulas.

This is because the Tamil calendar year "averages" 365 days for a year. The
length of the months vary from 29 to 32 days. Also the same month can have
30 days in one year and 31 days in another year. A new month begins with
"sankranthi" (the sun entering a new zodiac sign), but the complication is
brought in because of the fact that if the sankaranthi occurs after sunset
(6 PM) the month starts the next day and an extra day is added to the
current month.

We should be able to write a library to do date arithmetic on Tamil calendar
based on a look up table. Executing code to calculate sankrathi's for each
month might not be efficient. I guess we should decide on an epoch for the
library and run a table generator for a few centuries and package it with
the library. Interesting project.

I know a little bit of astronomy (not astrology!) math and am game to build
a library / or help a student if it will be of any use.

Application: virt-manager

What it is:

It presents a summary view of running domains and their live
performance & resource utilization statistics. A detailed view
presents graphs showing performance & utilization over time.
Ultimately it will allow creation of new domains, and configuration &
adjustment of a domain's resource allocation & virtual hardware.
Finally an embedded VNC client  iewer presents a full graphical
console to the guest domain.

Thanks for the tips but my reluctancy to go for a laptop is because of
repeated reports from my school seniors (who have now been in college for a
couple of years) of their laptops going missing. So i am kind of fixed on a
desktop for the time-being. What I am looking for is a regular desktop with
good specs that would be suitable for college use...
Awaiting your replies.

I thought about this before. But, from my point of view... challenges are:

1. Koha only takes MARC format record for entry. They ( my friend ) don`t
need MARC, they just want to input direct text like Book name, Author name,
Barcode number, Price...

2. DSpace only takes pdf or some data... my friend will not upload any
electronic format books or anything there.

So, now.. what can we do now?

What exactly is "college use"?  If you want something with which you
can do your assignments, then any computer sold within the last 5 years
will do.  If "college use" includes games, then you can never be satisfied!

Here's my recommendation:

1. the best/biggest monitor you can afford (20+ inch LCD with VGA and DVI)
2. TVS Gold mechanical keyboard, and a Microsoft Basic mouse
3. good hardware warranty and support from your vendor
4. as much RAM as you can afford (3GB is recommended for 32bit OS)
5. AMD CPU and ASUS/Gigabyte board, and peripherals

Note that everything other than your monitor, kbd, mouse will lose value
very quickly.  So IMO buying the fastest CPU or graphics card today is
pointless.

Good news below.

Gujarat to introduce Linux in schools

Rajiv Shah | TNN

Gandhinagar: The Gujarat government is all set to follow Kerala?s
Marxist-led Left-Democratic Front (LDF) government in IT education in
schools. Following Kerala schools, it has decided to use only Linux
operating system, the opensource free software, in the computers
installed in 3,650 schools.



Linux will also be installed in another state-run 2,750 schools, where
computers will be installed this year. Freely downloadable, Linux is
internationally regarded as alternative to Microsoft Windows.

?If the experiment in schools is successful, we will go ahead and do
it for computers in Sachivalaya, too,? a top IT aide to chief minister
Narendra Modi said, adding, ?Installation of Microsoft Windows
software on each computer costs Rs 5,000. With Linux, we will save
huge sums.?

Though there was initial resistance to it in Gujarat?s top powerdom,
the big cost of maintaining massive Windows-based infrastructure
became the main reason for abandoning Windows solutions and moving to
Linux applications.

It is estimated that the state government will be saving close to Rs
100 crore by installing Linux in schools. Call it anti-MNC Marxist
bias, but in Kerala schools even mandatory IT tests are held in Linux.

Before opting for Linux, the state education department officials are
learnt to have held tough negotiations for installing Microsoft
Windows operating system. On an average, each school has 11 computers
and one LCD screen to give computer training to children.

?If it the Microsoft Windows?costs Rs 5,000 in market, negotiations
helped us to bring down the price to Rs 3,000 per computers. But after
intense discussions involving IT experts, it was decided to do away
with Microsoft Windows and go for Linux,? the Modi aide said.

State education secretary Hasmukh Adhia told TOI that computer
teachers in government schools are still not fully accustomed to
Linux, but the state government has begun training them in batches.

The National Institute for Information Technology (NIIT) and Educamp
are carrying out training in phases. ?It does not require more than
two days to teach computer teachers how to use Linux, as it is easy to
download and work on computers,? Adhia said.

I think I asked about this on an earlier occasion too. Nobody responded. 
If the owner doesn't respond this time too, I think you can contact the 
Twitter folks and ask it to be re-assigned. Something related to their 
'verified account' feature, I suppose. Since nobody seems to be using 
it, we will have an easier time convincing them, I think.

I was looking at the calendar on my wall - all the days are there and July 1st 
is always Aani 17th. But in practice this is not so - from what you say and 
from what I have understood. Therefore the printed tamil calendar can only be 
accurate with a margin of error of two days. Right? - only the name of the 
year can be more or less accurate - but even that, for the beginning and the 
end of the year there is a two day margin of error?

Message-ID: <AANLkTilYdN8JfunDT7JxwS3r_IeoRvE22l6AcKI-xiOK@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I recently moved from ubuntu to openbsd 4.7 since in this release they
included support for atheros 5212 wireless chipsets. However, I am having
problem getting my wireless connection working. My wireless router is
netgear and it supports 3 ports. I have 2 machines running on other ports
just fine. After installing openbsd4.7, I read "man afterboot" and went
ahead with configuration described in man pages, i.e.,

#ifconfig ath0 192.168.1.3 255.255.255.0 NONE nwid <nwid> nwkey <nwkey>

after the above wireless card indicator on the computer turned green. As
suggested I also created /etc/hostname.ath0 file and added one line since my
router is dhcp enabled

# cat /etc/hostname.ath0
dhcp

Also, "ifconfig ath0" shows status as active with the correct values for all
other parameters. But dhclient ath0 simply times out with no DHCP offers
coming back. I am also unable to ping any machine on www, other than what I
gave in the ifconfig (192.168.1.3).

"route show" and "nestat -an" show that 192.168.1.3 with flag UG, so I am
assuming that is good?.

Any ideas?. Thanks.

The printed calendar will always be right - This is because the designers
would have referred to a Panchangam, which will give them the astronomical
data, or more simply the entire calendar to refer to. This is one of the
reasons why there will be a Panchangam printed every year. Calculations are
made (or referred to an ephemeris) for the year and then printed. There is
no perpetual calendar like the western calendar.

Regarding varying start of month, take a look at this-
The month of Aadi starts on-
16th July in 1996, 17th July in 1997, 17th July in 1998, 17th July in
1999, 16th July in 2000, 16th July in 2001, 16th July in 2002

Regarding varying number of days for the same month, take a look at this-
Month of Vaikasi had 32 days in 1996 and 31 days in 1998. Similarly, Aani
had 31 days in 1996 and 32 days in 1998.

Yes, the year names are more simple - 60 names cycled over and over. This 60
years is based on 5 Jupiter revolutions around the sun (Jovian periods).

[Off topic to this discussion] This discussion uses the term 'varying' only
because we want to "Map" the Tamil calendar to the western calendar. Most
problems in local computing is because of this, including the simple
keyboard. We are trying to "Map"/"Adapt" the English keyboard to enter
languages which have no grammatical similarity with English. FOSS software
and hardware has the power to let us create fundamental computing blocks
which can be out of the box and not an adaptation. This gives us
an opportunity to use the brilliance of our cultural/scientific heritage
(Indian calendars / languages) in computing.

First of all open OpenOffice and go to Tools > Options. Now click the
Memory category located in the left sidebar.
Increase the graphics cache to 128MB for the Use for OpenOffice.org,
Increase the Memory per object to 24MB,
And uncheck Use a Java runtime environment.
There is no magic number so you will have to experiment here and keep
the setting that suits best.

Hi All,

I wrote a very simple python web application (using CGI), which accept
a student roll number and show the student's detail from the DB. While
searching, I got many CGI, mod_python, WSGI based examples. Which is
the proper way? If possible, plz point to some good example/tutorial.

CGI is pretty much dead , mod_python is also outdated very much . The
way to go now a days is WSGI  .If you are using apache try using
mod_wsgi .

http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/

WSGI Pep : http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/

WSGI is a interface specified by the python langauge  .

WSGI is the recommended approach.

Everything from Apache, Lighttpd, Google App Engine, and even
Microsoft IIS support WSGI and you can deploy your python apps
with minimal modifications.


I suggest you go through WSGI limitations mentioned here:

The problem with web development in python is there are so many choices ! It 
really depends on what you want to do and how simple/complicated your 
application is.

For a mostly static site with only a few form submission/query pages, cgi (using 
the cgi module) should be sufficient. If you need to 'host' your entire site/web 
application using python, you might want to consider a framework based on WSGI. 
WSGI has become an unofficial 'standard' on how to write web applications in 
python. However, you'd almost never use a standalone WSGI server implementation.

My own preference is cherrypy + SQLObject (database) + Genshi (templating), 
which is a good balance between light-weight cgi like application and full-stack 
frameworks like Django.

Some links that might help you make your own choice:
http://docs.python.org/howto/webservers.html
http://wiki.python.org/moin/CgiScripts
http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks

as mentioned, mod_python is dead. The two current flavours are either apache 
with mod_wsgi or nginx/cherokee with fcgi. And as also mentioned, no one uses 
python cgi programming except as a learning tool. There are a zillion 
frameworks out there - django, webpy, web2py, cherrypy, turbogears etc etc 
etc. Again using db programming is also out - there are ORMs like sqlalchemy, 
django ORM etc. And no one writes plain html - templates like cheetah, jinja, 
mako, and a zillion others are there.

Is it suitable even for a simple appl or only for framework kind of
stuff? Bcoz after reading all the pros and cons, I am bit confused and
went to the known method CGI :)

simple app - plain cgi is enough - no need for wsgi or mod_python or anything. 
And simplest template would be cheetah. But simple apps rarely remain simple, 
so at some stage you will have to migrate.

My application is a simple use and throw test appl. So I will strict to CGI.

and the great thing about python CGI is that it has only two methods (or 
atleast had in 2004), so nothing to learn. Whereas the  %$#@! cgi man page 
would take at least a month to read ;-)

Just for curiosity's sake - why not web.py? I heard it finds a great 
balance between doing plain cgi and a full-on framework like Django.

webpy is mentioned above - and another reason to use it is that a core 
developer is our very own Anand C - in fact the current inpycon 2010 website 
is being run on infogami - a wiki that runs on web.py. But what Bharathi is 
doing is a simple throw-away app - and as he says - no need for any framework.

I noticed web.py in the list - I was just wondering why it wasn't 
recommended over CGI, as the latter seems like a rather crude approach. 
 From whatever I've seen, it seems to inter-leave python code with html. 
Not that there's anything wrong with it, but I rather like web.py's way 
of separating views into .html files and stuffing the values in python 
vars/placeholders.

Throw-away programs have a habit of becoming rather useful and grow big, 
so it seems with only a little bit more effort, web.py provides a much 
cleaner way to do a web app, even if it is a throw-away one. Not that I 
have a lot of experience with the Python side of things, but if you'd 
ask me to give a way to do a simple web app with minimum fuss, I'd 
rather recommend Sinatra (which seems to be inspired by web.py) rather 
than the clunky Ruby CGI module. Perhaps I'm over-bearing the point, but 
web.py/sinatra seem to hide enough of the rough edges of the CGI 
approach, while giving plenty of room for starting small and keeping the 
code clean/organized/flexible, just in case this tiny app turns out to 
be useful.

Vamsee.

You can use this to extract specific fields from image files and make
scripts that sort your images according to quality, background color
or image size.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimZeQ6qqWgDYS07MbCWdoEtCSs5_pLhNVpb-XJR@mail.gmail.com>

Finally I succeeded in getting this working! Actually my config file is
faulty. For connecting Nokia 3110c via cable, config file should me modified
to port = 1, model = 3110c & connection = dku2libusb .

After that 'getsms' command works like a breeze. But, the 'Gnocky'
connection broken error remains. It is because there is some permission
problem with the devices. To get rid of it, produce these command one by one
in the root prompt,

chown -R mahesh:mahesh /dev/bus/usb/*
chown -R mahesh:mahesh  /dev/ttyACM0
chmod 750 -R /dev/bus/usb/*
chmod 750 /dev/ttyACM0

Don't forget to change 'mahesh' with your username.

But, again, there is a problem! When the cable is removed, and reconnected I
have to produce these commands one again. AFAIK, these device locations are
only created when the device is connected. So, is there any way to make the
permissions permanent?

Yes. You will need to write correct udev rules.

that depends on the user - python cgi does not force one to interleave html 
with the python code. It is simple to separate the two using either simple 
html files or templates. I have done python cgi programming for several years, 
and I was just looking at the code, and in thousands of lines of code I do not 
see a single line of html.

Is CGI "legacy"? I would say yes but "almost dead"? nope - if you 
just look at web hosting space and then if you get into some of 
the world's largest financial institutions still they are using 
CGI "pretty much" since most of their web apps running under it. 

Especially, I see Perl CGI still rules in many areas and phython 
just started it's journey in the enterprise world.

there are many bidders for FOSSCONF, so this needs to be decided fairly soon. 
If the other bidders also re mention their interest, we could decide something 
and move on.

You can only do it with a perl DBI interface.

Can we please have a ilug-c-tamil mailing list and direct announcements
in Tamil to that list instead of mixing languages like this in a single
mailing list?  It is rude to Ilugc members who might have speak Tamil
and violates common netiquette to stick to a single language in a
mailing list.

Oh no you did not just raise this! Now watch in awe as 
otherwise-reasonable people go completely bonkers with linguistic 
chauvinism ;). I don't know if you remember long enough, but the last 
time this issue was raised, the argument went on for *weeks* with no 
real resolution, with the final decision that the OP should post an 
English translation. Or at least, others who can do a better job, should 
do so.

I don't see either of them happening lately, but I've learned to ignore 
the mails. No amount of heart-burn is going to convince anybody towards 
a reasonable solution. At least, that has been my experience. If 
suddenly the audience has grown up (it's been a couple of years, I 
guess?), it would be nice to see one, after all :)

I have created this Big size Tux. http://www.scribd.com/doc/34185180/Big-Tux
Basically it is a 4x zoomed version of A4 sheet Tux. All you need to print
on A4 sheet (require 16 A4 paper) and then arrange then into 4x4 fashion to
get a big size tux. This i made for pasting it in-front of my flat.
tuxlovers also do the same.

PS: Penguin does not only present linux kernel but it has become a de-facto
symbol of Linux based OS and FOSS.

Please, please, please... we already discussed this earlier and
came to no useful conclusion.  I don't think anything useful will
come out this time either.  Just drop it please.


If you don't like Tamil posts, just delete them and move on.  There
exist a minority of users on this list who read/reply in Tamil.  Even
though I'm not  apart of this group, I'm thankful for their existence
and activities.  Without their support and demand for native language,
this industry will embrace an English language monoculture. And
monocultures of any sort are bad things.

Do not mistake me. Once in a while the mails are posted in Tamil on ilug-c
mailing list.

I feel that we can continue as it was.

Mixing languages is just bad netiquette.  I have no problems with a
diverse culture but create a different mailing list and post there. 
Even on global free software projects, noone insists that a single
mailing list should have posts in multiple languages to avoid
"monoculture".

Hi,

the following one of the two solutions may help the situation.

a) Request the tamil team to post an english translation to the respective
tamil post
or
b) Request them to tag post with [tamil] , so that people who do not need
it, have the facility and freedom to send it to /dev/null

i second this tamil tag approach. Please with/without interest in
tamil posting can have better handling of tamil mails.

 Convert Code To HTML Using Vim

If you wrote some elegant code, and want to publish it as a HTML page,
you can easily do that in vim:
In command mode, type this:

? ?:TOhtml

A new buffer will be opened with the HTML source, just save it:

? ?:wq

If the original file name was ?thasucode.c?, you?ll find a new file in
the same directory named ?thasu.c.html?. Open it with your favorite
web browser.

Hi Shrini,

Easy way would be : If you have the existing html then just change the
contents of that html file and edit the blob field and update this file. I
have tried and it works.

To read the contents try out this query :
SELECT SUBSTRING(blobfield FROM 1 FOR 32000) FROM tablename;
This returns the string of that blob content.

Another way would be using fbsql_read_blob php function. More :

+1 for the [tamil] tag. It beautifully fits the Postel's Robustness Principle[1] 
on the list's part.

Reasons:

* The list is mostly English with tamil being the occasional exception
* The insistence for a separate list for tamil posts is not justified, since
    - it might split a perfectly good community (most people do not like to be 
subscribed to more than one list with the same general agenda)
    - the volume of posts in tamil is too low for a separate list
    - the [tamil] tag is more elegant since even if we create a different tamil 
specific list, the problem will not be solved automatically, the list might 
still get a poster who does not know of the existence of the tamil list. OTOH, 
if the [tamil] tag is missing, anyone who replies can easily add it to the reply 
so the filters work well (and might also remove an existing tag, if a 
translation is posted). Hopefully, this won't break the flow of the conversation.

cheers,

Your point about poor netiquette is well received.  The number of
of Tamil posts and users are too small to start a separate list.


Please consider that this LUG is hosted Tamil Nadu, and therefore
has an obligation to promote FOSS especially in Tamil.  I agree that
it's a different matter if someone posts in Swahili.

Also consider the fact that the Tamil localization team is a very
small group of passionate developers.  Localization is essential in
enabling millions of non-English speaking Indians to use computers.
The currents state of Tamil content online leaves a lot wanting, and
we should not discourage those who are actively improving it.

Btw, the current ILUGC mailing list etiquette mentions nothing
about the accepted languages in this list.  So at least in this sense
these Tamil posts are not doing anything wrong.

This is my last post in this thread.

So make it easier to filter out Tamil mails by tagging such mails.

You have to recognize that there are lots of people subscribed to this
list that do not speak Tamil and this is a mailing list with English as
the established common medium of communication.

No preaching about Tamil Localization please.  I have been played the
role myself and I doubt Linux Indic localization is actually helping a
substantial population at all but that is besides the point.

Applicatin: Kile

What it is:

Kile is a user-friendly LaTeX source editor and TeX shell for KDE.

The source editor is a multi-document editor designed for .tex and
.bib files.  Menus, wizards and auto-completion are provided to assist
with tag insertion and code generation.  A  tructural view of the
document assists with navigation within source files.

The TeX shell integrates the various tools required for TeX
processing. It assists with LaTeX compilation, DVI and postscript
document viewing, generation of bibliographies and indices and other
common tasks.

Kile can support large projects consisting of several smaller files.

Features:

    *  Compile, convert and view your document with one click.
    * Auto-completion of (La)TeX commands
    * Templates and wizards make starting a new document very little work.
    * Easy insertion of many standard tags and symbols and the option
to define (an arbitrary number of) user defined tags.
    * Inverse and forward search: click in the DVI viewer and jump to
the corresponding LaTeX line in the editor, or jump from the editor to
the corresponding page in the viewer.
    * Finding chapter or sections is very easy, Kile constructs a list
of all the chapter etc. in your document. You can use the list to jump
to the corresponding section.
    * Collect documents that belong together into a project.
    * Easy insertion of citations and references when using projects.
    * Flexible and smart build system to compile your LaTeX documents.
    * QuickPreview, preview a selected part of your document.

I hope the tamil team understands the freedom of others as well. For the
sake of members, they at least have to tag it with [tamil].
Looking favourable answer from [tamil] team.

	L230
Message-ID: <AANLkTimePy3CQzaJafvH0oeJo7fqIGsKei9VHk_XULeg@mail.gmail.com>

On paper the NComputing L230 looks promising, claiming compatibility
with Linux.  Their "middleware" desktop virtualization software posted
on their website is for only one distribution specifically Ubuntu 8.10
(which has seen end of life).

I installed the "middleware" software on Ubuntu 10.04 (as I did not
have a 8.10 install handy) but the whole install is hosed and I have
lost my 10.04 desktop!  Sure I may be able to recover the installation
but not without loosing time.
I am downloading 8.10 and will try out the middleware on that platform
later in the day.

Would like to hear about your success/failure experience with
NComputing L230 and Linux desktop virtualization (please mention
distro name/version/arch).

Thanks.

hi ravi,

i have working with ZTE 880+ on ubuntu..
may  be it would be similar to the one which you are having right now.

for me the device was a dual mode usb modem..

initially it was acting as USB Storage Device and another mode
"usbserial mode" which was modem.

i have used usb_modeswitch package to resolve this issue..
later used wvdial to make a ppp connection..

check out my blog post, i hope it helps:

Use (as root)

# usb_modeswitch -v 0x19d2 -p 0xfff5 -V 0x19d2 -P 0xfff1 -M
5553424312345678c00000008000069f030000000000000000000000000000

Now you should see modem device appear. (typically /dev/ttyUSB0 )

Most results show up give the above command without the 'M' switch which is
essential for many kernels.

Dear LUG members,

I am a north Indian and a regular reader  of this mailing list for
about 2 years now. And I should say that I am equally annoyed by those
tamil emails as some members of this mailing list are by the one
written in Morse code.

Even though the decision regarding Tamil is in the hand of community
[and admins], my personal opinion is to make a separate list [of
Tamil] and the monthly mailing list reminder mail can contain info
about that as well. Otherwise, I am afraid if the number of Tamil
mails grew than [annoyed] people like me have to leave, making this a
Tamil-speakers-only list, it is for the admins whether it aligns with
the vision of this LUG community or not.

(morse code idea was impressive :) )

Personally, I am not annoyed, but just less likely to read the mail if
an English translation of _at least_ the subject or summary is not
provided (because my mail client isn't Indic script supporting, and I
am too lazy to go read the mail in a browser). While people, I guess,
are free to post in Tamil, they can not hope to reach the complete
audience with their query or whatever they wish to share. If they are
fine with that, then I don't see an issue.

If local language mail which you can't read become an eyesore, you can
just move it aside, I guess. A separate mailing list might lead to
fragmentation, but I am unsure.

> (morse code idea was impressive :) )

Actually, that isn't fully representative. The Morse code at least has
(several) translators online which can be used by anyone who doesn't
know Morse code. In case of Tamil, it is virtually impossible for
non-Tamil readers to figure it out without help from a Tamil
person.

This seems to be a frequenting problem for people around the world. Even
me... :D
Well, I use a tool called PhotoRec that is bundled with TestDisk. It must be
available o the Ubuntu repos. If not, follow this
link<http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download>
.
But I must warn you, do not write any data on to the partitions/hard disk.
You will loose data.

Hi,

>>If local language mail which you can't read become an eyesore, you can
just move it aside, I guess. A separate mailing list might lead to
fragmentation, but I am unsure.


I am  not in favour of a separate tamil mailing list,all that what i request
is to tag the tamil post with [tamil](earlier the same request has been
raised by some members,about a couple of year back!!) , so that , any one
who does not want the tamil post, has the freedom to direct the mail to
/dev/null. I do not see any problem on this.

regards,
Thyagarajan Shanmugham

On GNU/Emacs,

Open a file/type one containing the code

M-x htmlfontify-buffer

It even saves your theme colors.

LinuxQuestions.org is calling you for Quarterly LQ Zero Reply Drive.

One of the main goals of LQ is to help members get questions about
Linux answered.
One way we help facilitate this is with the "Zero Reply"
functionality, which allows you to easily find threads with no
replies.
In the spirit of helping other LQ members and based on feedback from
previous efforts,
we're making the "Zero Reply Drive" a quarterly event here at LQ. The
latest LQZRD will start at noon today (LQDT)
and run for 96 hours.

During that time, I invite everyone to click

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/lqsearch.php?do=noreplies

and attempt to answer as many questions as they can.


Note for the RHCE/Linux Admins :
Answering these questions will give you a lot of
real time experience of Linux Troubleshooting.

Wishes.

Hmm.. Problem with Gmail. :-)

Thiagarajan's indentation should have been like this:

now, you won't get any more hyper link to click on. the PS was

It did not work.

Opened a file and typed M-x htmlfontify-buffer there was a [No Match] remark
and nothing happened.

UNP: Now extract any archives without any worries


Many of us may know how to extract a .Tar.gz file. But how many of us
know how to extract a .bz2, .lz, etc files. Some extra option to tar
will do the needfull, but we will need to know the options for each
type of archive.

But no worries any more. You can now use 'unp', a script that extract
any type of archive by itself.
To extract any archive just type:

$ unp archive_file
where "archive_file" can be a rar, zip, tar.gz, deb,
tar.gz2, rpm or any other archive.


The best thing is that you can use unp to extract multiple types of
archives at the same time.
example:

$ unp *.tar *.tar.gz *.tar.bz2 *.rpm *.deb *.zip *.rar

To extract all the archive files in the current directory:

$ unp *


Install unp

$ sudo apt-get install unp

Hello Tamil Lovers,

Please confirm here, on your acceptance of

1. Providing English translation so that all can read.

or

2. adding [tamil] tag in
your subject lines on all your tamil mails.
so that some people can filter.

Eventhough you are doing good events for the community,
you should hear from the community too.

Is ILUGC Mail server going back in time? I thought we have had enough
of this. But well, I am not annoyed at all. I see the subject in tamil
and all I do is the following:

1. Use 'j' or 'k' to go to the converesation.
2. Press "#"

All is good.

// No, The limit has to be increased at-least 30kb

I have sent a mail on July 8, It was missing. @List admin, Can you please
do
the needful.//

I would also like to request for increase in size.

At Tamil lists that are around, we let the default 40kb as such. 

Important mails like event descriptions, meeting minutes, announcements
etc., tend to go beyond the limit of 10kb

Implemented both the recommendations. (Added Tamil tag and provide
translation - Will do as much as possible for future mails  in the list)

======Translation begin ======
On this matter, can not give any guarantee.

See, you wrote in English. But, that is related to Tamil communication.
Reply to that can be in Tamil, those who can may write in English.

This mailing list has seen a lot of such instances. Request you to look
through the archives.

I can understand the requirement to mention Tamil in Subject. But, sometimes
it is not doable. That is the reality.

We beg your forgiveness, there is no other way out. Will try out best, in
case we could not comply, please bear with us.

Even now, there is a death at home. Came to the town to read work related
mails, and see this. Can give the translation.. but it is late, need to
leave.

Hello Victor,

I understand the frustrations of non-Tamil speaking people in the list.
Please try to understand the other side and from where he is coming from.

I have had a few conversations with Amachu and know how much he fights for
the use of Tamil in many situations. It is considered illiterate, rude,
countrified to use Tamil in many places (classrooms, high end public places,
student groups).

When a person fights for his right (and the rights of lakhs of others who
are excluded due to language), he might have developed a stubborn streak
never to compromise anywhere (like RMS insisting on Free everywhere).

It is fanatical, illogical, yes. But we need more such idealists to make our
world a better place and more inclusive.

Please bear with a couple of mails a month for the sake of our less
privileged brothers. Consider these mails as a statement that someone who
can not converse in English also can participate.

When traffic in Tamil increases to say a couple of mail every day a separate
mailing list might make sense.

Thanks for your understanding.

best regards,

Ma Sivakumar

While looking for using Google Accounts as Open ID provided learnt about
Google App Engine.
http://code.google.com/appengine/

You have option to develop in Java or Python. Data storage is in Google
proprietory data storage service called Datastore and uses gql a google
proprietory database query language.

You get a free SDK and free hosting for upto 5 million page views a month.

On the positive side, it is ideal for small business to start creating an
application without spending money for tools and hosting. This can be the VB
of web application development.

The question is how open Google will be with its implementation? How secure
/ safe the data would be?

I run my site http://www.mapatree.org/ on GAE and haven't faced any problems
till now. The site is developed in Django. There are small changes in syntax
when one develops a solution on GAE, but these can be quickly learnt and the
solution can be deployed for *free*.

The only expense for me w.r.t Map-A-Tree was buying the domain - GAE helps
in minimizing your costs a lot (jargon alert : 'lean enterprise').

Toads would fall from the sky when GOOG removes this *free* usage.

Hi,

Thanks Ma Siva Kumar  for the translation .


>>I can understand the requirement to mention Tamil in Subject. But,
sometimes
it is not doable. That is the reality.

@mail administrator

Can we explore mailman by writing a plug-in to stamp tamil mails with
[tamil] tag,currently mail man stamps the subject line with [ilugc] tag.

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Friends.

We welcome the efforts on Tamil.
All the efforts are for the community.
The community is requesting for english translation or tamil tag.

If you reject the requests of the community,
how can you expect they will come to your events/activities?

Please understand that you have freedom to post in tamil.
but, please respect our freedom too.

I dont think it is so tough to translate in english, atleast add tamil tag.
Why it is not doable?

Please accept the request of the community.
We need a win-win solution for this issue.

Victor

yum install urbanterror.  On first launch,  it will download a very
large set of content but the game play is very similar to Counter
strike.  Try it out

Victor try to understand the sentiments of a fellow ilugc member. He
is no ordinary tamil ilguc member posting in tamil in ilugc. He is the
author of fsf manual in tamil and is a big contributor of tamil to
FOSS in a big away. May be srinivasan t (our ilugc cordinator) or
raman or others can comment on his achivements. So it is ok to have a
few mails in tamil come by without the necessity to tag it as tamil or
translating in tamil. If you dont speak tamil kindly ignore these
mails. If there are high enough mails in tamil then we will have a
separate mailing list for tamil. Till then i ask all people to bear
with it. See although i am a tamil by birth. i dont know how to read
or write in tamil. i have tried to learn from online and also from my
mother and relatives. but not found much success. Till now i can read
with some diffculty. So what i am trying to say is i am as much
troubled as other north indian or non-tamil speakers in the list. So i
repeat , let the tamil flow in this list , once we find that there are
more than four mail in tamil on almost daily basis then we will ask
Dr. Sriram or Barathi or whoever maintains this list for a separate
tamil mailing list. Till then i ask them to ignore.

Ashwin K.

How is simply tagging a few mails to make it easy to filter being
connected with anyone's contributions?  If I am a kernel hacker, am I
somehow special and allowed to top post?   A few people seem to be
confusingn contributions will following common netiquette. I don't
understand why.   Nobody is criticizing contributions.    Please stop
equating disconnected things.

May be you are right. But i suppose he assumes he should be allowed to
post freely in tamil without tagging or anything as this m/l being in
capital of tamil nadu ?? like the way nobody would question posting in
french in a mailing list in paris. How do you counter this?
I am very much in favour of tagging it tamil.

Hi All,

I need some help in creating the best possible table schema for the
following condition.

There is a competition where people are allowed to signup in groups.
Each group has a groupid, each user has a uid, each group has  group
specific data like group_question_id etc. A single user can be part of
multiple groups. Each user can answer the group question with
group_answer_uid. The number of group_answer_uid (s) for user is equal
to number of groupid is he is part of.

Data
====
1)groupid
2)uid
3)group_question_id (specific to each group)
4)group_answer_uid (specific to each group for each user)

Following queries have to be made.

1)list all groups the user is part of
2)list all users in a groupid
3)list all group_answer_uids for a given group


What is the best schema possible for this?

Deepan

My Try:
 #Users - username,userid
 #Groups - groupname,groupid
 #Usergroups - userid,groupid
 #GroupQs  - groupid, groupQid,groupQQuestion
 #UserAnss   - userid, groupQid, userAnswer

Where Users,Groups,Usergroups,GroupQs ,UserAnss are the tables and the comma
separated list in front of the table name is the columns.

As for the queries, if you are using django-orm(or any other ORM) then it
should be pretty easy.

Pretty easy.,  The place where a mailing list is hosted doesn't change
netiquette in this context.  English is the established medium of
communication in this mailing list.  You can't point to a single LUG in
India (or probably globally) which allows mixing languages like that. 
Why should this one mailing list be the exception because a couple of
people can't be bothered to tag mails to enable rest of us to do
filtering?   If everyone else wants tagging, they should just oblige.
Anything else is just plain rude.

Just this morning tried to boot Ubuntu 10.04 from an USB created using the
utility that comes with Ubuntu (8.10 on my laptop). It did not work - got a
msg that said that no kernel image was found. Many have faced this problem -
which seems to be because of a problem in the usb creation utility! Finally,
managed to do it only after writing the image to a CD!

But others have done it without trouble. SO try your luck!

Sir,

I think I have seen so many (& lengthy too) replies for a such a small thing
in this world.

We all talk about freedom - just using FOSS is just to prove this.

It would be even more nicer to have a seperate language (or tag) for.  If we
want more people to use Computers  and also FOSS, making them to use in
their mother-tongue is the best format.

And if some of us indulge in this, it is better to channelise it, than to
cut it or so.

this is my humble opinion.

thanks for allowing me to get into this.

Can you rephrase the above? Do you mean that if a user P belongs to

A :user has_many :groups, and :group has_many users. You can create a

Well, since gae-java is on JVM <obvious />, you can write on any
language that compiles to java bytecode.
That goes to Scala, Clojure, JRuby, Jython, Kawa(?!)  and any other
JVM based language.

Victor,


       I agree with a request for a translation so that you can also
understand. But like everybody knows, it may not be practical for the
sender.

       I do not agree with your request for tagging.

       Really, you could choose to ignore/filter (by user?) - thats your
freedom. IMHO, you cannot ask somebody to do extra work so that you can
filter the mails.

       Tagging would be more appropriate if the topic discussed is out of
the purview of this list - not the same with a using a different language.

Victor said:
> Those people who sends mails in Tamil, have to confirm their acceptance in
this thread.
> Others, please wait for their confirmation.

       btw, you seem to make this a broader request on 'behalf' of the
community. I dont know much history about this list - are you a moderator?
Are you issuing an ultimatum or something?

Regards,
Madan.

Well, its obvious that you are missing the el files for htmlfontify

It took me 2 min to google to get this: http://rtfm.etla.org/emacs/htmlfontify/
(coincidentally, they've named the site as rtfm)

Rahul,

Most of us (include me) are taking part in these discussions as a side issue
(to support our day job which earns us Rs). There are others who are on
their feet, pounding the streets of villages and small towns and they may
have a different perspective.

Just imagine a person who is skilled in IT, but not comfortable
communicating in English (can not translate!). Should (s)he be out these
discussion groups? Even though, rationally I can not agree with Amachu's
stand, I can understand his principle from that perspective.

We must have a provision for such a hypothetical person to participate.
Please have a re look at this.

We will try to tag and translate as much as possible, if the original sender
failed to do that. We can also look at automatic tagging by the list, if it
is possible.

Best regards,

Ma Sivakumar

Sorry, I also searched in google for htmlfontiy use, and could not get any
straight forward answer. I was just trying out and did not probe further.
Thanks for the pointer.

BTW, vim option works out of box, emacs needs a el file. What does it say?

To be clear,  I do not demand translation but I don't see any reason any
person would not able to tag mails.  That doesn't require any big IT
skillset or English language skills.   I have heard zero reasons why
that is not a feasible option.   If that is done by the mailing itself, 
I am fine with that.  Thanks.

vim vs emacs is a religious war - we already have enough wars, this
one we can do without.
personally i use vimperator for firefox, emacs bindings for zsh and
vim for rails development & emacs for learning clojure. So, both are
my buddies.

Personally, I use vi where I do not have the option to launch GUI editors
(remote servers and some quick edits). Otherwise, I use kate and gedit.

I really really didn't want to reply on this thread - as people
pointed out, this will just die down and things will go back to the
usual self.

but seriously - "do extra work"? - they take all the pain in the world
- using transliteration (or other RMS certified tool) to write a mail
in Tamil - spending a good amount of their time [as compared to
writing a mail in English, writing in Tamil takes more time - i hope
you agree on this - for a 'noble' cause of course!], but tagging the
subject line with [tamil] is extra work? - I'm missing something here.

1. We're confusing sympathy/emotions with guidelines. [a typical
Indian behavior i should say - IMO]
2. If I wanted to promote tamil in lug, I would try to create a
separate mailing list for myself.- IMO

Having said that, I don't mind if I get a mail that has '???????' in
it. Because, anyways I get mails from ilugc that has 'Hi' as subject,
replies on digest mails, top posts, mail that does not do proper
"google" research (this is a mailing list guideline!) and others. This
will be one among them.

There's a third solution. You filter it yourself. I decided to try this
out and you know what? Filtering email with subjects containing the
letter '?' resulted in every email with a Tamil subject in the last 3
weeks (I don't have mail from this list before this date stored on my
computer) being filtered and not one email with a non-Tamil subject
being filtered.

If you have trouble implementing this solution in your email client, I
and others here will be happy to provide you with assistance.

Hi,

Though i would like to know the implementation, is it fair that if the
[tamil] tag been added will help some linux user who sits away from tamil
nadu(say for example a user like zico from bangladesh or Arunkhan from
mumbai)  to forward it to /dev/null.

add your thoughts,

Subject: [Ilugc] New list guidelines
Message-ID: <AANLkTinvs9KRJL1pAUjpfwPk3VlEcwB12LQHeeZllOf-@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

Our mailing list is a technology list.
Our purpose of having a list is to reach many people as possible.

Though we know many people here personally,
we maintain some guidelines in the list.

We can discuss commercial things here, but with a tag [commercial]
If we talk something offtopic, we do [OffTopic]
We strongly suggest people not to top post.
We advice the beginners not to use SMS Language.

All these are just to ensure that the quality/ethics of the list are maintained.

Chennai, is a multilingual city.
Lot of Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam, MorseCode speaking people are in the list.

They all are having the same freedom to discuss in list in their languages.

But, They keep their discussions in English, to maintain
some common mailing list ethics.

If Lynus wishes to send us an email, we would
expect it in English, not in Finnish.
Same is applicable for any language, any person.

As a democratic community, It is our responsibility
to hear and follow the requests of the community.

I Agree that, It may be tough to type in english,
translate in english or add [tamil] tag in the subject.

But, bearing some pain for the community for its request
is a great contribution.

We are working hard on spreading FOSS.
Some of us may focus on spreading Tamil/Telugu/Hindi/Malayalam/MorseCode
Via FOSS and it is our own freedom to spread our own concepts.

But, injecting our personal goals in the public mailing list
when the list has some objections in not a good culture.

Everyone in the list should have the freedom and opportunity to
read the mails, ask questions, and answer to the questions.
Forcefully grabbing their freedom by preventing them
to read/understand the emails is unfair in the list
where we all are spreading the freedom.

To make sure that everyone in the list has the freedom
to read and understand the mails, I request all of us to
inherit the following things in our emails.

1. Have the subject in English
2. Provide a translation of the content in english, if we use any
other language in the content.

Eventhough it is tough and gives pain,
we have to bear the pains to give respect to other's freedom.

Let us stop the language discussion here.

Hope all the language lovers give the freedom to the mailing list
members to know what they are typing.

Thanks.

Terminology, please! You are referring to crackers. Please avoid
misuse of the term hackers, atleast in F/OSS mailing lists. Hackers
are programmers who are passionate about solving problems. More

Well, in OP's defense, it's not so obvious. The likes of Scala, Clojure 
etc are specifically targeted at JVM, while Ruby isn't. It's because of 
the almost-heroic efforts of JRuby team that Ruby runs in production 
setups on JVM today.

You are correct. If user P belongs to group A,B, then P can answer
questions in both group A and B. (remember there is only one question

No. If the (ASCII/Non ASCII) content size is going beyond the 10K,
then please upload the detail version in our wiki site and send mail
with crisp info and the corresponding link to the list.

I am not writing this for the sake of ILUGC alone. 

It matters to all LUG across India.

When you are in a LUGs mailing list, that has its operations in a lingually 
operative/ approved state of India, learn to expect, respect and tolerate 
mails in that language of state.

We swear to do that, in case of Marati in ILUG Mumbai's list, Hindi in ILUGC 
Delhi's list, Telugu in case a Hyderabad list, Kannada in case of Bangalore 
list.

And give great encouragement to such posts and mails, for that can alone 
reflect the true spirit of India & Indianness.

I am a native speaker and still prefer to not get the mails in multiple
languages in a single mailing list.  If that must done, I would filter
them and would like to see the mails tagged to enable this.  I would
also note that no LUG seems to practise the method you prefer and this
has nothing whatsoever to do with tolerance but using a common medium of
communication.  A practical problem is that a lot of people do not have
the fonts installed and would just see meaningless text and it doesn't
matter what language it is. 

Let it also be clear that noone is discouraging Tamil translation work
but when you go as far typing in Tamil, it is not much of a burden to
tag the mails.  It is a simple straight forward thing to do and I do not
understand the fuss about it.

Hi,

I am a native speaker and i am in favour of having english as the primary
communication language in this mailing list.

I hope the new mailing list guidelines explains what is right and what is
not!.
The good thing which i see about the new guidelines is that if i post the
content in  a language , i have the responsibility and duty to supply the
english translation for the same and keep the subject line in english.
The new guidelines is more focussed on inclusiveness of people in promoting
foss which in my view is the fabric of indianism.

appreciation Shrini for your direction!.

regards,

There are cases under which such thing is practically not possible, that makes

Though I do not want waste time on petty issues, this issue is getting dragged unnecessarily (and repeatedly).  In my opinion

a.tagging is the best, simple solution. When someone can take 15 minutes
  to type mail, just typing five extra characters [TAM] is not difficult.
  Consistently refusing to do so appears fanatic.

b.Since mails in tamil are too little we can ignore them. As pointed by
   another poster if mails exceed 4 or 5 a day, let us think about creating separate list.

c.Though full translation cannot be given all the time just an abstract will help others.

I wish all stick to guidelines as set by co-ordinator.

Oh, this seems rather easy. Here's what you have to do:

1. Login to your Gmail account from your desktop

2. On the right of the search box there's a link saying 'Create a
filter'. Click it.

3. Now, among the boxes there, there's one labelled 'Subject'. In that
box type '?' (no quote marks). For another language you'll probably want
a letter that is common in that language.

4. Test the filter by clicking on the appropriately named 'Test Search'
button.

5. It will probably find all the Tamil mail.

6. Click 'Next Step' button.

7. Select the 'Delete it' checkbox and any others that are appropriate.

8. Click the 'Create Filter' button.

You're done. If you want, you can use the OR and AND keywords to make a
more complicated and possibly more accurate filter (fortunately the
letter ? is common enough to make this unnecessary).

As for your other question, I'd rather not answer because I don't want
to get sucked into that discussion.

Yeah . I cant even recognise the font . A translation is welcome by
the community if interested .
What I don't like is some people ( including you) don't even keep
their display name in english . Bilingual display name ( one can be
tamil ) is welcome because if your name is completely in tamil
characters , it gets hard for someone to identify you . Luckily the
email address and domain namings are not yet in tamil :P

> Telugu in case a Hyderabad list
Seriously try that .. and you will see the response :D AFAIK
Hyderabadi's don't speak telugu but hyderabadi which is a mix of urdu
+ hindi + telugu + english words ;)

Anyways ..people in hyderabad are not as passionate you and others
about telugu .

Message-ID: <AANLkTimEHIaQdIrt_Lfj6MfuwvnlTFZOwGx2FRy3Md9y@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Any recommendations for email archiving software?

Requirements include:
1.  Good indexing and searching engine (high-level customisation - at
config file-level - and tagging would be a huge plus)
2. Web interface for searching and browsing
3. Allow automatically (during indexing) or manually linking to
associated images, audio, and video files.  These files may not be
email attachments.
4. Slight chance it may need to work with Outlook archives (PST?)

I've used Mhonarc (http://www.mhonarc.org/) in a limited fashion about
10 years back, but that was in a Solaris mbox environment. Its then
rival, Hypermail (http://www.hypermail-project.org/), seems to be no
longer actively developed, per its home pate.

mharc (http://www.mhonarc.org/mharc/doc/) which builds on Procmail and
Namazu seems to have most of what I want. Anybody who has used this
and can comment?

Sameer

Dont send attachments to the mailing lists.

Give some url link to your image.

eg : you may post the same image to your blog/flickr/picasa/etc and
then you can give that image url.

As you said translation cannot be done in all cases but yes, tagging can be
done and is a very good solution. Non native speakers can filter them out.
Tamils also can do that if their ethics permit it. coordinator, please reply
with a consistent tag to be followed: [TAM] or [TAMIL] ?

I too hope so. All the same I request the coordinator to increase the mail
size limit because as Amachu said posting elsewhere and linking will break
the flow of conversation[replies and quoting are difficult then].

it needs two people to have a mailing list - create a tamil list for ILUGC and 
let all posts there be in Tamil - actually I enjoy reading tamil posts and 
would like to improve my tamil by replying in tamil. So let us do that.

Amachu,

We always welcome mails in tamil.
But with a translation.

Everyone in the list have same rights.
It is non-ethical to discuss something
where some people see only boxes, question marks, non readable characters.

It means they are prohibited to read the mails in the list.

No one has the authority to prevent the readers from getting the information.
This basic right of getting information should be maintained for all
the list members.


Please give a solution to maintain the basic rights of all people.

Giving English translation is a nice solution.
If you can not do all the times, it is illegal to ask people
to bear the boxes and question marks.

As you know more about freedom, please
give a solution to the list members to know the information from the
tamil mails.

We have the following requirement.
We should know the information from the tamil mails,
without searching for a tamil known person to read the mails.

Any solution from you?

I have lived in Tamilnadu most of my life - I do agree that when I was in 
school and college in the 60s and 70s, Tamil was looked down upon. But that is 
no longer the situation as far as I know. Here is my experience in various 
places where I interact with people:

1. Ooty - you can hear tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Badagu spoken depending on 
who is in the group. Generally the rule followed is that if everyone in the 
group speaks Tamil, tamil is spoken, same rule for other languages. And if 
there are all mixed languages, English is spoken. This is purely out of 
courtesy.

2. Ootacamund golf club (where previously 'Dogs and Indians' were not 
allowed). Again the major language spoken is Tamil - followed by Telugu, 
Kannada, Badagu and even several varieties of North Indian languages - only 
when there is a mixed group is english spoken.

3. AU-KBC centre in Anna University - again mainly Tamil, unless there is a 
mixed group

4. ILUGC meets - same rule, Tamil, unless there is a mixed group.

this same policy is followed in Karnataka also - for example, in Mangalore, 
you have the major languages as Tulu and Konkani, but if Kannada speakers are 
there, we often switch to Kannada and even to English if they do not speak the 
other languages. And I have seen the same thing in Mumbai. The only place 
where I have seen this rule not followed is in Delhi where some people think 
that if you do not speak hindi you are not an Indian and insist on speaking in 
Hindi whether you like it or not.

I have not been in any forum in Tamilnadu where speaking in Tamil is frowned 
upon - my daughter is a so called 'elite', 'convent' college in Coimbatore - 
and everyone from the Principal to the Warden and downwards only spoke to us 
in Tamil when we went for admission.

This kind of tolerance for language and respect for others is what makes our 
country great - so let us follow the rule.

if it was an english mailing list, then every one would question it. And if it 
was a french mailing list in Paris then an english post would be questioned. A 
nice example is openstreetmap - the main mailing list is is in english, and 
there are hundreds of language mailing lists. Occasionally someone posts in 
other language in the english list - usually he immediately apologises or 
gives a translation. Usually the non-english posts are due to inadvertent 
cross posting.

if such a person cannot even write '[TAMIL]' - there is no hope for him. And 
if he cannot summarise his post due to lack of english, he has to mention that 
in tamil and we will help him out.

I second this.

I would be interested in creating more technical content in Tamil. If a
separate list is the way to go, I am all for it.  Let us do that and start
building content in Tamil. Amachu is there, kg is in, I am also interested
in a Tamil mailing list. We have three.

It can be called ilugt (t stands for Tamil Nadu) or ilugct (ilug chennai
tamil). Will iitm host this list?

Sivakumar, Kenneth,

     I think the tamil localization team needs the inputs of english
speaking members, and ilugc by and large appreciate the efforts of the tamil
localization team members. Both can grow on each others strengths, and have
a chance to cirtique each others' misgivings.

     Splitting this list is not a positive change for either lists.

     Please don't catalyze the split. Its better to be one with
controversies than be divided.

Regards,
Madan.

no one has advocated splitting the list - even if we have a tamil list, no one 
is going to leave the english list - only those who *also* have an interest in 
tamil will join that list also.

again, please do not use the word 'split'. This is an additional list to serve 
additional needs. I remember in the old days of the Bangalore Linux Users 
group, there were several lists - tech, non-tech, and one or two others. The 
main list was tech - the others were for special interests.

Mairix is great at indexing mbox/MH/Maildir.  I don't think it has
a web interface, but it's fairly straightforward to script/automate.

Hi,

Anybody successfully communicated using DM9601 USB Ethernet adapter?
Presently it is successfully detected, interface is up and able to set
IP address. But no packet is coming in or going out of this interface,
link is not detected and no change in (Rx/Tx) packet counters.

Thank you, will check it out and also nmzmail (which came up with
'apt-cache search mairix') for my own use.

But the original request is for an organisation which is tech-savvy,
but unfortunately [1] filled with people from a M$ and related
consulting background. Commandline search and/or mutt (for nmzmail) is
not likely to fly.

Regards,
Sameer

[1] Because they are used to either standalone desktops/laptops and
have very little experience with the productivity coming from a campus
of always-on networked machines, as opposed to sporadic Internet
connections.

// Our mailing list is a technology list. Our purpose of having a list is to 
reach many people as possible. Though we know many people here personally, we 
maintain some guidelines in the list. We can discuss commercial things here, 
but with a tag [commercial] If we talk something offtopic, we do [OffTopic] We 
strongly suggest people not to top post. We advice the beginners not to use 
SMS Language. All these are just to ensure that the quality/ethics of the list 
are maintained. Chennai, is a multilingual city. Lot of Hindi, Telugu, 
Malayalam, MorseCode speaking people are in the list. They all are having the 
same freedom to discuss in list in their languages. But, They keep their 
discussions in English, to maintain some common mailing list ethics. If Lynus 
wishes to send us an email, we would expect it in English, not in Finnish. 
Same is applicable for any language, any person. As a democratic community, It 
is our responsibility to hear and follow the requests of the community. I 
Agree that, It may be tough to type in english, translate in english or add 
[tamil] tag in the subject. But, bearing some pain for the community for its 
request is a great contribution. We are working hard on spreading FOSS. Some 
of us may focus on spreading Tamil/Telugu/Hindi/Malayalam/MorseCode Via FOSS 
and it is our own freedom to spread our own concepts. But, injecting our 
personal goals in the public mailing list when the list has some objections in 
not a good culture. Everyone in the list should have the freedom and 
opportunity to read the mails, ask questions, and answer to the questions. 
Forcefully grabbing their freedom by preventing them to read/understand the 
emails is unfair in the list where we all are spreading the freedom. To make 
sure that everyone in the list has the freedom to read and understand the 
mails, I request all of us to inherit the following things in our emails. 1. 
Have the subject in English 2. Provide a translation of the content in 
english, if we use any other language in the content. Eventhough it is tough 
and gives pain, we have to bear the pains to give respect to other's freedom. 
Let us stop the language discussion here. Hope all the language lovers give 
the freedom to the mailing list members to know what they are typing.//


I do not find anything that is of advisory kind to the other side..

If it is advising only one end, it is biased & suppressive.

The shall be statement, in the guideling stating that,

//
This is a Chennai-Tamilnadu based mailing list & there are people interested 
in expressing their FOSS related activites and events they conduct in Tamil.

Hence there shall be occasional mails/ replies in Tamil. New joiners-existing 
list members who are of other kind are advised to make notice of this and 
respect the freedom of localites.

There shall be some occasional lapses. Please do not jerk under such 
situation.
//

If this could also be added to list guidelines, then tagging any "direct mail" 
to ILUGC with [?????] can be accepted.

Me too is interested in creating technical content / answering questions in
Tamil if a separate list is started.

I know very well that, many Tamil speaking students in this list, who were
not better in English, only read the mails and have never posted/replied for
any mails.  If a separate Tamil mailing list will be started, I am sure
that, there will be more postings / replies in the new list surpassing our
existing ILUGC list.

It can be called ilugt (t stands for Tamil Nadu) or ilugct (ilug chennai
> tamil). Will iitm host this list?

It would be nice, if it is called as ilugc.tamil

please use a conventional quoting style - I cannot find out which is your post 
and which is quoted. Secondly it looks like you are disputing the decision of 
the co-ordinator. His decision is final. We may not like it, but when he makes 
a decision we *have* to accept it and support it. Otherwise there will be no 
use in having a coordinator. And as far as our coordinator is concerned, he is 
doing a very good job. He listens to all sides before coming to a conclusion.

Hi Ramadoss,

I dont understand why you say tagging is not possible. When you have
time and patience for typing a email what is difficult to add one word
in that mail. Please dont send a tamil reply to this as i dont know to
read tamil. Why is it so difficult to tag your tamil mails? And i dont
agree with shrinivasan t suggestion for translation of tamil mails in
english.its double the effort  and further why go for so much effort
when simple tagging would do. In my not so humble opinion i think you
are being rude by saying you will not tag your email and saying that
it is diffuclt or impossible to tag your emails.

with regards,
ashwin

I fully agree with Kenneth. Our co-ordinator has listened before
posting his decision. So i request Ramados to abide by the
co-ordinators decision.

Personal preferences apart, we should have some  ethical standards  in any
forum. BTW  I am a member of four other forums on various subjects. This
forum FLAMES occassionally but thats part and parcel of any discussion. My
humble suggestion  is let  us *follow the guidelines set by the coordinator.

After you connect the device (and it is powered on), please post the output of:

  /bin/dmesg
  /usr/bin/lsusb
  /sbin/lsmod

You can save the output to a file, and paste the file contents inline
in the e-mail:

  /bin/dmesg > dmesg.txt

SugarCRM is not entirely FOSS.  Only about 50% of the code is.  Rest of
is proprietary.

This is ilugc which is based at chennai which IMHO is not just
tamilnadu capital but also is a south regional centre comprising
telugus,mallus and kannadigas .
( remember potti sriramulu a telugu person wanted chennai to be andhra
pradesh capital :P )

The way you use the word 'other kind' is offensive and may also term
you as being 'racist'

By the way why is your tag '[tamil]' which is supposed to help people
separate emails also in tamil script ?

Having said all this . I appreciate your books , your Gnome , KDE
translations and great tamil team work done by you and the teams
formed by you .

All I ask is in a community if you also let us know ( in english) all
activities  we would be more appreciative. Hence a translation for
each and every tamil mail you send is requested.

Also communities run by being friendly and sharing knowledge without
any barriers. Lets not make language a barrier among ourselves .

Just to lighten things up a bit, I give a +1 to anyone who can retype the
whole of the first message on the thread by hand... in "MORSE CODE", and try
to do so without the use of a program. I don't mean to mock anyone, but I
thought it would be fun to try and translate a relatively large mail to and
from morse code. That's all...
Cheers, and all hail Morse code and Linux...

Hi Vignesh,

Is there a web interface for MIT computer society mailing lists? If you set
up a ilug-tamil list, all those who want to communicate in Tamil will
subscribe. Please set up the list and let us know.

I agree with Thyagarajan. I'm sure 90% of members on this mailing list know
both English and Tamil. Why not post in English (wherever possible) and
reach all the members? In Mumbai LUG mailing list nobody posts in
Marathi(*).

Auto Directory Spelling Corrections.

     To turn this on:

          $ shopt -s cdspell

     Now misspell a directory in the cd command.

          $ cd /usk/local
                  ^-------- still gets you to --

                                           /usr/local

Now, don't worry about misspelling and Enjoy with shopt. ;)

Yes we have the interface at http://lists.csmit.org
As I said already we can do that if the community decides to do so. Let's

Yes. It is at http://lists.csmit.org/ Presently it hosts private lists and a
public linux mailing list called mitlinux@csmit.org which reaches all
students of MIT.

Please set up the list and let us know.

We have to decide upon a name before setting it up. I think it is better to
name it as "Tamil Free Software User Group" or something in that line. The
name 'Linux' does not adequately reflect the broad range of software (and
issues) we will discuss in that list. *We are not going to talk only about
kernel there.* As far as i can remember, may be only 5% ILUGC mails are
about *Linux*.[Of course >50% doesn't deal with computers at all, but it's
another issue.]
It also undermines the contribution of a great visionary because of whom we
are all able to experience free[dom] software and talk about it and fight
over setting up of mailing lists in native languages. Till date I regret
naming the above list as 'mitlinux'.

Dear All
We are discussing the matter about one week. We have to reach in some
conclusion.
My comment on topic is
1) There is no need for a language tag. Because when somebody sends a Tamil
mail the subject line will be also in Tamil. So if some body see a Tamil(or
even any non-English subject) he or she can ignore if he/she is not able to
read it. We are much bothered about freedom
2) Providing translation for the mail - If the original author of
non-English mail provided translation somebody can volunteer to translate
it.
3) I am not seeing any relevancy for a Language specific mailing list under
the roof of ILIGC. Any how we will be talking about same
techno-philosophical matters related to FOSS.
4) I am a non Tamil Speaker, still the Tamil mails are not at all annoying
me. With my limited Tamil reading skill I may try to read and understand it
time permits. Otherwise I may ignore it; like a topic which is not
interesting to me  or totally unknown to me (I think most people will do the
same). So what I feels is that - creating a new mailing list guidelines is
not required.
5) I have seen that Malayalam mails are appearing in the Kerala based FOSS
mailing list. Many non malayalaees are there in the list. Still I didn't saw
any such complaints in the mailing list, or arguments for a Malayalam tag.
6) If we increase tags what will happen if somebody says taht I am not
interested to read "technology X" and "technology Y" related mails and the
authors are requested to tage the mails with [technology X] and [technology
Y] tag?

Dear Amachu,

Please see the following link.

http://picasaweb.google.com/tshrinivasan/TamilInVariousBrowsers#

This is how our mailing list members view the tamil content
with their various browsers.

Eventhough if a person knows reading Tamil,
he can not read anything from these boxes.

Things will become even worse, for a person
who dont know to read tamil.

All the list members have the right to get information from this list.
we should not deny their rights by showing them only boxes.

Any member of the list, whether he knows Tamil or not,
Whatever the mail client/browser, has the right to get information
from the list.

Please provide a solution to give the information for all.

I have requested for a solution already in a previous thread.
Still we did not get any reply.

I request you to stop sending mails in Tamil,
without giving any solution.

Thanks for understanding.

Reality. 
This is what I wanted to show, so Shrini made it

My RedHat 6 sound card problem was solved by "English List", My Reliance FWP internet connection was done with the help of "English List", My query on "Why images are only rectangles" was explained by "English". 

Kindly use only English , because of your tamil content, I am unable to gain your knowledge.

we are talking about setting up an *official* tamil list for ILUGC. If such is 
decided, the hosting would preferably be at IIT along with the other official 
list. You are free start any list you want - but it will not be an official list 
and will not be put up on our websites. Please wait for a decision on this.

this post is against list guidelines as it does not contain [Tamil] tag and it

 I said *we* have to decide. We -->community.
Nobody is fighting with IIT for hosting it. CSMIT officials offered to host
it when sivakumar expressed doubt as to whether IITM will host or not.

Of course people are waiting. Nobody took decision now to start any list.
See my reply above. Here some people tend to think that they can talk on
behalf of community while others cannot. Please don't invoke 'I've done so
much to community' clause. That clause has already been invalidated in this
same thread by the very same people who now think they can say what and what
not will be put-up in website. That is for community (by extension,
co-ordinator) to decide for.

IMO, just a [Tamil] tag would suffice. Mandating translation might be like
penalizing (as in twice the work) for posting in tamil. Perhaps, the subject
alone could be translated in english.

But, these etiquette cannot be expected of people who want the spotlight
firmly fixed on their personas. So, just set your mail client filters
appropriately and get on with it. I don't think any 'disciplining' is
needed. After all, these are just guidelines. Not the law!

// this post is against list guidelines //

The list guidelines are suppressive. 

Whenever the list guideline is sent in future, We have the duty to remind 
about it. We shall do it by posting a humble reply to it. 

Off course, the Supreme court has the provisions to reconsider its own 
decisions, the Parliament has provisions to amend even the Constituion, and 
this LUG will at some of point of time realize it. 

Our duty is to simply humbly remind it, time and again untill it is realized. 
Obvioulsy we won't rake up issues like other side has done so far, we have to 
move on with other things, setting this aside.

What ever that are posted in Tamil are related to Free Software & Technology 
related,  not sports & movie stories.

// as it does not contain [Tamil] tag and it does not contain a summary in 
english.//

Oh.. You need a tag in English. That can be listened to. 

When there is a lapse, send us gentle reminders, just as you do for top 
posting, instead of creating flames.

We don't mind some one reminding us.

On providing summary & translation in English, the best way is to leave it for 
any volunteers to take up. 

If some is willing to pay for the time spent on reverse translation, this can 
be done without fail.

We need a solution for non-tamil members to get the information.
We have to make sure that they have their rights to get the knowledge.
No one should deny their rights.

Please give solution for this.

As per amachu's request
I am ready to volunteer for the translations of tamil mails to english.
Though I have little knowledge in tamil,
Like to contribute to the list members.

Thanks a lot.

Will do the same for all the tamil mails as possible I can.

OP is talking about USB Ethernet adapter with the DM9601 chipset.

@Bharati - I have had mixed success with the DM9601 chip USB dongles
sourced from Lam Rd. in Mumbai.

(a) One nameless brand with a blue transparent casing works great with
Ubuntu 10.04.

(b) Another nameless brand with a dark brown transparent casing does
*not* work on Ubuntu 10.04.

With (a) kernel recognizes the device and initializes the respective
eth? device whereas with  (b) dmesg recognizes the device but throws
up error message.  I don't know much about device driver coding but
suspect some difference in firmware.  Your experience may be
different.

The  Apple USB/RJ45 dongle  from what I understand it is well
supported and so is the SMC USB/RJ45 dongle.

Since you are in SIN, they may be more readily available (not much
success in the Mumbai channels).

I think, things like "??????? ?????????? (Kattrattra Menporul)" are meant
for Tamil readers and doesn't apply globally for everyone.

So, we are "not" denying their rights / preventing them to know something
they need to be aware of.

Tamil - unarguably is one of the best languages of the world.  And don't
forget, this mailing list is from the "Capital of Tamil Nadu" (Chennai)

If in this mailing-list, if a person is not allowed to type freely in Tamil,
then where he is going to get the rights?

Tagging "[Tamil]" in the Subject is a viable option which the end-users can
use to filter out such emails from the list.

-------------

Overall, I think only change Amachu can do is to use "[Tamil]" tag instead
of "[?????]"

It happens because font for the concerned language will not be available in
the system. All the browsers are Unicode aware, but it needs fonts too.
Installing fonts will solve this issue.

continuity - IIT has a staff member in charge so we are assured that the list 
will continue until he retires - and I am sure he will nominate some one to 
continue it. I have seen in other LUGs where some person hosts the list - 
continuity is dependent on the person. A classic example was the linux-chix 
lists when the  founder opted out - actually this happened twice to them. 
Mumbai list also had some problems - even now I think Space Kerala is hosting 
it, but if that organisation folds up, then they have to look elsewhere. IIT 
Madras will not fold up. Also I work in MIT and am aware of the miserable 
connectivity and bandwidth it has. Further I do not know whether the people 
who have offered to host are staff or students. If they are staff, I have no 
problem with it as there will be continuity - but if they are students, there 
is no way they can guarantee continuance after they leave. Anyway first let us 
see if the LUG coordinators decide to have an official tamil list, then see if 
IIT is willing to host it.

Nice work, but i feel this could not be a Long-term solution.

Just adding "[Tamil]" tag (in English) would do as messages in Tamil are
obviously targeted for the Tamil-Readers.

one solution is to install unifont - this font is not very pretty, does not 
render too well, but it contains all the known language scripts in the world. 
We use it in openstreetmap.

Dear Victor,
Please don't post the translation if you are not sure about its correctness.
What you have translated is just the opposite of the original message. This
will cause great confusions especially in such message about the meeting
schedule.

The correct translation is as follows:
Hello,
The meeting regarding Free Software (in Tamil, of course) will be held
tomorrow(according to the original message, but now its today - July 17) as
announced.
But the Ubuntu manual, Fedora manual and KDE translation which were decided
as the subject of this meeting are postponed to next month, due to some
unavoidable reasons.
However we will be discussing things including our part in the Tamil Web
Conference (as part of the World Tamil Classical language Congerence) held
in Coimbatore last month.

Apart from this two, I have one more white with name VZTEC. All of
them showing the same Product and Vendor ID, getting detected and up.
But it is not able to detect the link pulse.  I getting the following

Let me check it out. Here I am seeing more china brands rather then
the standard one. But the price is high, for ex, this USB Ethernet

Hi

>>Tamil - unarguably is one of the best languages of the world.  And don't
forget, this mailing list is from the "Capital of Tamil Nadu" (Chennai)

I am a tamilian and love tamil as you do, yes, tamil is a fantastic
language. Please remember this mailing list is "Indian" in the first Place,
"Linux" in the second place and very lastly "Chennai Chapter"(Indian Linux
Uer Group- Chennai Chapter) . So, this mailing list is *not* just for
tamils, it is for all (Indian) Linux users.Please do not quote something
like "we are locals, and respect the local sentiment",  that makes me to
think about the  rational thinkers who oppose this adamant tamil posters are
from mars or venus.

Having said so, writing articles in tamil , communicating in tamil is much
wanted, but where?, IMHO, not here. This is the place where we are
interacting on technology and people from various part of the world
participate. This is the time to consolidate as ilugc on our strengths,not
presenting boxes,question marks,unicode numbers in various browsers. As
discussed we can have a separate list, and from my side i will also join and
contribute my efforts.

There wont be any official tamil, official hindi, official telugu,
official malayalam,
official moresecode mailing list for ilugc.

But, anyone can run their own mailing in their own language.
Please inform here, if you start such list.
Interested people will join and discuss in their own languages.

Thanks.

Nope..

The meeting is happening today as scheduled. Only thing is that the planned 
Agenda item for this month's meet will take place next month, due to 
unavoidable situations that rose.

Hello Amachu and friends,

Sorry amachu, freedom works inside a framework, this framework is called
"rules/law/guidelines". Breaking it, is not a desirable one.
I am a born  brought up chennite, and do not endorse your stand, does this
makes me that i am coming from mars or venus?.
I am sorry to dispute with guidelines which is proposed by the co-ordinator,
but willing to help amachu with his draft

>>Amachu wrote:
>>Hence there shall be occasional mails/ replies in Tamil. New

list members who are of other kind are advised to make notice of this and
respect the freedom of localites.

Since we differ what localities are , i am framing an equation like this
Localities = "amachu and  amachu like thinkers minus other localities"(i am
in the other localities ;).

substituting the string in Amachu draft,

 "Hence there shall be occasional mails/ replies in Tamil. New
joiners-existing
list members who are of other kind are advised to make notice of this and
respect the freedom of amachu and amachu like thinkers  minus other
localities."

//
My comment on topic is 
1) There is no need for a language tag. Because when somebody sends a Tamil 
mail the subject line will be also in Tamil. So if some body see a Tamil(or 
even any non-English subject) he or she can ignore if he/she is not able to 
read it. We are much bothered about freedom 

2) Providing translation for the mail - If the original author of non-English 
mail provided translation somebody can volunteer to translate it. 

3) I am not seeing any relevancy for a Language specific mailing list under the 
roof of ILIGC. Any how we will be talking about same techno-philosophical 
matters related to FOSS. 

4) I am a non Tamil Speaker, still the Tamil mails are not at all annoying me. 
With my limited Tamil reading skill I may try to read and understand it time 
permits. Otherwise I may ignore it; like a topic which is not interesting to 
me or totally unknown to me (I think most people will do the same). So what I 
feels is that - creating a new mailing list guidelines is not required. 

5) I have seen that Malayalam mails are appearing in the Kerala based FOSS 
mailing list. Many non malayalaees are there in the list. Still I didn't saw 
any such complaints in the mailing list, or arguments for a Malayalam tag. 

6) If we increase tags what will happen if somebody says taht I am not 
interested to read "technology X" and "technology Y" related mails and the 
authors are requested to tage the mails with [technology X] and [technology Y] 
tag?

//

Thank you & all those who stood for the cause, understanding us.

We wish the change will happen at some point, until then we will keep 
reminding.

For your information, the offer did not come from a single
person.(student/staff). CSMIT offered to host it and CSMIT, in its 30 years
of operations, has seen many staff in-charge and student officials retire
and the events it had supported has only increased and never discontinued.

FYI, the servers of csmit.org(for that matter, mitindia.edu) are in USA,
maintained by Dreamhost, one of the best hosting company in the world.

Again, its not single person who offered it. The offer was made by the
chairman on behalf of CSMIT. I'm its chief executive and assure that offer
was made with full support of the board of Directors.

I was under the impression that it is one of the worst in the world. And I do 
not think a LUG mailing list should be hosted in USA. But anyway, that is 
beside the point as there is not going to be an official tamil list.

once again I would request you to please follow a standard quoting style - 
your style is very confusing and it is impossible to see what you are quoting

Whatever it may me,

Without a similar statement of that kind is included as part of mailing list 
guideline, and if such a guideline is cited as reference only to people 
posting in Tamil, please expect an immediate or delayed humble reply to such 
mails  that,

"This mailing list has a guideline that is suppressive & biased."

I request more and people to post in Tamil to make it a common factor, 
preferably with [TAMIL] tag.

Off course, it need not be Senthamizh. 

When most us here meet we communicate in Tamil. There is nothing so special 
existing here to refrain from doing the same here. 

All you have to do is to learn typing in Tamil asap.

Hi All.

I request all of you to stop the language discussions.

Amachu can send mails in only Tamil
Victor can translate it wrongly
Vignesh can give a correct translation
Amachu can again acknowledge it.

This cycle can be happen to all tamil only mails
until they all realizes that
the content should reach all people correctly and that
is possible only when the OP posts in both languages.

As amachu accepted to add [tamil] tag, and
there are some volunteers to translate the content (even wrongly)
Let us stop the discussion here.

Anyone has the freedom to post in their own language to the list.
but it is their responsibility to add/arrange for english translation.

ILUGC is not a monolingual list.
It is a bilingual list.
i.e (any language+english translation) is accepted.

I request all of you to STOP this language discussions.

if you still want to discuss further, you are welcome to the monthly meeting
on Aug 14, at IITM.
Let us discuss in person there.

Thanks for all your co-operation.

If you want to create desktop application and if you are aware of
web-development stuff like JavaScript, html5 etc then Qtwebkit is the most
easiest way to develop software.
In this program, I have created a small application.
Application contains 2 buttons and one webpage element. (It looks like 3
buttons but the third button is from test.html using html input elements )

If people arent following guidelines, why are they still active in the list?
they should be banned temporarily.

posting content in one language and translating it to english - waste of

when i joined ilugc a decade ago, it was purely a technical list. I
communicated with my broken english. and at that time, people concentrated
on linux, foss etc. not on language. but everyone followed mailing list
guidelines and posted in english (even though this is not part of
guidelines).

Need to Delete a File for Good -- not even GOD can recover.

    You have a file "secret".  The following makes it so no one
    can read it.  If the file was 12 bytes, it's now 4096 after it
    has been over written 100 times.  There's no way to recover this.

      $ shred -n 100 -z secret

    Want to remove the file? Use the "u" option.

      $ shred -n 100 -z -u test2

    It can be applied to a device

      $ shred -n 100 -z -u /dev/fd0

I guess there is no need for separate list for Tamil. One exists already
started by Mugunth - the creator of e-kalappai.

http://groups.google.com/group/freetamilcomputing

Great People are already there discussing about Tamil, FOSS related Tamil.
Please join there and contribute.

Lets not reinvent the wheel.

Since there will not be any separate Tamil list, we should post mails in
Tamil with [Tamil] content to the current ilugc list.

However I dislike this option, I will avail it and try to generate technical
content in Tamil (following the rule, of-course). I will start with
providing Tamil translations to interesting information sent in English.
Thanks.

Message-ID: <AANLkTil3ngZmLM0h5Umb3XJlcCUvrfphF8fJ7JIZp4dX@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sirs,

-  for the past few days - I am not able to get into yahoo.com - for opening
my mail.
-  I have tried opening this using - firefox, chrome, opera - but no full
success.
-  a week back or so, i was able to get into my yahoo mail account, but when
I tried opening a mail, it took such a long time (more than 5 minutes) - but
it was just a simple text mail, like there it was around 5 to 6, and I just
logged out.
- second time, I tried opening it could not get thro even the yahoo.mail
page itself.
- i could easily open my gmail accounts, my old rediffmail accounts etc,
without any problem.

My question is :

- is there any one who is facing the same problem
- is there any problem in settings (if any !!!)


Any suggestion would be welcome

Thanks

We all forget this. :-)

NRC-FOSS is not responsible for Anna University Syllabus.

As ILUGC members, can we do anything?

Friends.

"setup" is a command line sysadmin tool for redhat based distro's.
"yast" has a command line version in suse.

These tools make the sysadmin activities easier.

Is there any such utility available for ubuntu?

Thanks.

Subject: [Ilugc] Few comments..
Message-ID: <201007172225.40374.ramadasan@amachu.net>

* Thanks to NRCFOSS-AU-KBC, We are all set to hold our sixth month meeting on 
FOSS subjects preferably with Tamil as medium of communication.  (the meeting 
was conducted today) (We are part of this LUG, and we consider this also as 
one of the activities by its participants) 

* I being the co-ordinator, used to send invitation e-mails, reminder e-mails 
to ILUGC as well as other mailing list that includes Free Tamil Computing, 
Ubuntu Tamils etc., This is something that has been happening for almost five 
months now.

* And notice all mails are in Tamil. Occasionally there used to be even cross 
posting between one or two lists mentioned above about these events.

* Unfortunately, I had to be in my village (which is yet to get even computers 
in its households) and was left without any internet.

* Since it was time to send a notice about this month's meeting, I had 
requested the person (I am avoiding the name here) who sent the original 
invite to the meet. 

* I noticed it is this mail that caused all that followed. If noticed the mail 
evidently didn't have the [TAMIL] tag and it was also a cross post. And in the 
past, most of the direct mails didn't have the tag too.

* There is obviously no need of such a tag to other mailing lists to which the 
mail was sent, hence incidentally, that person could have sent it to all lists 
together. This is another case, where tagging might go missing, but can be 
prevented.

* People in this list could have hinted the sender, that the mail is in Tamil 
& could have had the tag [TAMIL] and left it at that point.

* But that is not what all that happened.  Following all the suppressive mails 
that was triggered, probably, the co-ordinator of the list, in a good 
intention of not to hurt them, decided and drafted the new guidelines.

* Something that was not there has been included, due to the deliberate 
activities of few who fuelled the flame and it doesn't have any signs of having 
listened to our pleas.  

* Probably, some one could have conveyed to them, at the outset that Tamil 
postings are part of this list for quite some time, asking them to be calm.

* Unfortunately even that did not happen. That would have even stopped it 
there itself.

* So if a guideline is set there instructing post in Tamil to be of certain 
kind, then the same guideline should also state to other side to live in peace 
on seeing such mails, even some occasional lapses. 

* There is nothing worng in reminding us time and again.

* As a whole, I would like express this has deeply hurt us.

No - to the best of my knowledge.  There is "landscape" for managing
servers but IIRC it is not free.

Very interesting. ;)

But I loved the phrase "Not even God can recover. " ;)

I have personally seen people who can read people's minds, who can see
the past, present and future.

So this cannot be true. ;)

Anyway I shall accept it for the time being.

Subject: ????? ???????? ?????????..
Happenings in today's get together

???????,

Greetings!

??????????? ?????????????? ??????????????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ????????.

Even though there was no particular topic for discussion, the
gathering was lively.

???? ????? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ?????? ???????
??????? ????????? ????, ????????, ?????????, ??????? ???????

?????????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????? ?? ?????????
?????????????.

Nagu, Vignesh, Arulappan and Amachu shared the positive and negative
experiences which they had while they participated in the World Tamil
Conference in Coimbatore. In particular, they spoke about their
experiences in the exhibition and the Tamil Web conference, all of
which were very interesting. Bringing together several people, who
were hitherto unknown to each other is the speciality of these events,
and this is what would make it good to conduct these events on a
regular basis.

?????? ?????? ???????????? ??????? ??????? ???? ?? ????? ??? ??????????????.

All participants shall soon receive a Ubuntu Guru T-shirt.

????????? ? ????? ??????? ???????? ????? ???? ??????? ?????? ????????

????????? ??????? ??????? ??????????????? ? ????????? ?????????
??????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ???????????????.

A discussion was also held on the sudden and wild discussion and
debate on the issue of Tamil e-mails on the ILUGC mailing list. The
MIT students' proposal of having a separate Tamil Nadu focused mailing
list was also discussed. Since several people intend to communicate on
a regular basis in Tamil, the practice of Tamil mails will continue.
Even otherwise, it was made known that people could continue writing
Tamil mails in ILUGC.

????? ?????????

????????? ????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????? ???????? ???????
?????????????????.

Since there would be several attendees in next month's meeting, a
suggestion was made to have a timetable for programs on Tamil
computing. "Yaavarkkumaan Menporul" organization may hold the
responsibility for arranging funds for the programs.

??????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????????. ???? ???????????

The Ubuntu Tamil group's "official" recognition expired recently. To
renew it, in the coming week, the group in-charge Nagaraja said that
he was going to take necessary steps with the logo (unsure if I got
this right). He will share details about that event with the list.
Beneficiaries and supporters of the group were requested to join in
the discussions in #ubuntu-meeting and voice their support for the
group.

?? ?????? ????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????????. ????? ??????????!

We'll meet on the third Saturday of next month, a little earlier!

I have problem only in yahoo mail site - either I cannot enter itself (takes
a long long time - more than 1 minutes), and if it opens it takes a long
time to open a mail.

I use Airtel broadband - wired ethernet.  I do not have problem in any other
mails - gmail, rediff, or my official mail site.

I found this very peculiar.

thanks

yahoo! uses very complicated html/js constructs unlike google or any other site.

their interface is very heavy and cluttered.

your issue could be with your machine speed, memory or network latency
slowing down ajax requests.

Dear Mohan,

Please remember that we never used harsh words in
our discussions even we disagree with any person.

Note that siva has tagged as [Tamil] as our members requested in
the previous threads.

Even, no one requested not to send mail in tamil.
people requested for tamil tag and siva added that.

But, as per the guidelines, siva should posted the english translation.
Somehow he missed that.

For that, your words are not fair.

Please follow good ethics while disagreeing with any person.


---

Dear Siva,

This is an example of how people get irritated when they see
just boxes in their mails.

We already added the guidelines to add english translation too.
It is your responsible to follow the guidelines.

Even KG volunteered to translate in english when I compose this mail.

But, Mohan expressed his thoughts before the translation.

We all should be in list and discuss some useful things.
Pure Tamil should not be the reason for the people to go out of the list.

Please add english translations in your mails.
We had this in our guidelines already.


I am ready getting some mails from group of people
who know Telugu, Malayalam, Hindi, MorseCode.
They request me to approve their mails that will be
in PURE language without english translation.

I strongly advised them to add english translation.
Explained them how it will be unfair to the whole list.
They all agreed to post in english or with english translation.

Let us stop the language war here.

The OP should add english translation.

Anyone that crosses guidelines regularly will be banned from the list,
as we ban the people who mails on the requesting to join social
networking sites.

Thanks a lot.

Nobody asks anyone to post to a LUG . Its voluntary . Its the passion
and an urge to share which makes some one post .

Posting in Tamil is not irritating . Please use a mail filter if you
want them to end up in trash . Its very easy to filter out now that
all of them are tagged properly .
http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6579

Your need to decrease the spiteful nature of the mail when writing to
a public list . Just imagine how thousands will feel about you .

You are not replaying the thread . You are being offensive against the
tamil mailers . They are spreading free software ( which is bash in
this case ) in tamil . Thats a good thing to do and will encourage
tamil free software community in the larger audience ( the same
audience cant be found in normal tamil groups)

PS: Sivakumar great work . Looking forward to more such mails ,but
atleast a one liner in english on mail contents will help .

Regards,
Pavithran

My intention is not to irritate anyone. Anyone can filter out my mails with
the [Tamil] tag and ignore all Tamil mails. Even though I am not entirely
happy with being forced to add [Tamil] tag, I add it understanding the need
of other members and following the list guideline.

It could be stupid from some angles Mohan. But it is valuable from other
angles. Try to understand my position. If you can not agree with that,
atleast respect that.

Keep being part of the list and help the FOSS movement to flourish and grow.

There is a reasonable way to avoid these mails. In a technical list, even a
tag is not needed to filter out certain content (use unicode character range
for eg), but respecting your guideline and some members' requirement I will
add the [Tamil] tag until better sense prevails.

Please reconsider the guideline. If someone is filtering out the mails why
translation is needed? If translation is provided why the stamping
([Tamil]).

You took it up with Mohan.

Agree with you 100%. Even though we agree on the manner of discussions, the

As I said earlier Srini, it is logical to converse in Tamil in a Chennai
list. This argument seems to be made to prevent mailing in Tamil.

Agreed.

That is unfair, comparing writing in Tamil to requesting to join social

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2010-July/058743.html

The added guidelines are in the above link.
It never talked about the [Tamil] Tag.

1. Have the subject in English
2. Provide a translation of the content in english, if we use any
other language in the content.

You did not followed any of the above guidelines.



>> Please add english translations in your mails.
>> We had this in our guidelines already.
> Please reconsider as that puts un-necessary burden.

Please dont think following guidelines is burden.

Avoiding top post carefully, Avoiding SMS Language,
Quoting properly, is tough only.
But we all follow the guidelines to maintain a good culture in the list.

I request you to follow the guidelines.

It is the same logic to discuss in hindi as we are a part of
"Indian Linux User Group".
We never prevented Tamil mailing.
We all welcome that.
But, as a major part of the people dont know reading tamil,
they have no clue on what you are sending.

They need the translation from the OP.
We should consider their request.

I dont know why you are not considering this request.


>> The OP should add english translation.
> The guidelines should Insist on [Tamil] OR translation NOT both.
>

Yes.

1. Have the subject in English
2. Provide a translation of the content in english, if we use any
other language in the content.

Guidelines insist the English translation only.
Not [Tamil] Tag. Not both.

Guidelines are to be followed.
Not to break intentionally.

There should not be any intended violation of guidelines.

---

We should know the information from the tamil mails,
without searching for a tamil known person to read the mails.

Already requested for a solution in

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2010-July/058775.html

Please give a solution.

1. you are denying deliberately some part of people from getting the information
2. you are breaking the guidelines

What shall we do?

You have me there. As per your guidelines, I am wrong.

(The guidelines were revised hastily and without considering all aspects.
But, if that is the way this list should remain, I am sorry about that).

We were keep on requesting for a solution for non-tamil people.

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2010-July/058775.html
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2010-July/058828.html

we do not get any reply for that request so far.

If there is no reply for request from the other side,
there is no meaning in blaming the decisions are haste.

I am sorry
if you could not find a solution for non-tamil people or
If you could not follow the guidelines.

Thanks.

         By default, bash uses Emacs key bindings(It can of course be

Subject: [Ilugc] Tamil in various browsers
Message-ID: <AANLkTinFOLjCNu91NMc6XsTrVDbsjRSgdknxwDrjZ9nx@mail.gmail.com>

Dear co-ordinator,
   Already Amachu is tagging subject lines of his mails. Sivakumar also did
the same. What other solution do people expect? It is not amachu's fault
that those browsers didn't have Tamil fonts. If people don't want to read
Tamil mails and hence won't install fonts they can simply redirect the
tagged mail to /dev/null.
This discussion began by people requesting(demanding) this very same
functionality. But now it has morphed into *'Don't send Tamil mails at all'
demand. Is it fair?* what can Tamil mail senders do other than tagging?
Translation cannot be always done. Please consider  the difficulty in doing
so and decide the correct course of action.

@Mohan:
  Do not to use such words in a public forum. You are free to send tagged
mails to /dev/null. If you are lazy to add a filter don't expect other
people to add translation.

When [tamil] tag is there and all non Tamil knowing people (or people who
wont install font and see boxes) have filtered it then why some people
demand translation? Doesn't this sound ridiculous? I'm in full agreement
with sivakumar and others in this matter.
It is either translation or tag. Not both. There seems to be some sinister
design to stop Tamil mails in this list.

Non-tamil people should set a filter (one time activity) to send  all mails
with [Tamil] tag to trash. They have enough content without bothering about
a few Tamil mails in the list.

You can not have guidelines which expect a lot of additional work
(translate) and defeats the purpose (Subject in English).

A [Tamil] tag serves everyone's purpose. Please revise the guidelines.

//please give a solution to the list members to know the information from the

Technology by and large is in English these days. We learn English to know 
What is there. Few of us work to get that done back in our own language. 
If some one want to know something expressed in a language other than theirs, 
they have to learn it, hire themselves one or more translator or create a 
common fund and appoint some people full time to do translations for them on 
their behalf. 
They can obvioulsy make a humble request, but if that doesn't happen, cannot 
command the others.
Nothing much can be done.
PS: Dear KG, off late since I had to be on vacation for quite a long time and 
for similar other reasons, I have chosen to read mails from ILUGC GMANE 
interface's RSS feeds. Hence quoting the mails in a different manner. Will set 
back to normal in course of time, and then come back to normal ways of 
quoting. That helped in one way that all the falmes didn't arrive at my inbox. 
I am sorry for that.

Do not reply to an existing mail thread with a completely different
unrelated mail.  This is called thread hijacking.  Instead of pressing
reply, press write/compose on your mail client and send a new mail to
the mailing list asking for help and do specify in more detail what
exactly you are interested in.

Hello luggies,
     I remember the days i used to run to TV for my favorite soap or run to
a cinema to get tickets, well now a days i got lot more in ma gmail inbox. I
run home everyday to see whats happening in ILUGC mailing list. Its so
dramatic.

   During my college starting years I used to look upon to ilugc mailing
list for every technical clarification i had, for news updates etc. and i
wish it be so that way for present college goes or new learners, this
shouldn't be lost in a melodramatic fight.

   Well its a persons choice to choose his language for communication no
doubt but when in comes to something public, it should be on the overall
public's favor of goodwill. And considering the fact that not every one may
know the regional language used, a translation of the same in english may be
provided. When a program is written a documentation is given so that a
person who is not so profound with the programming language may understand
whats happening in the program. So with the same spirit why not document the
regional post in english.

Thank you !

Requesting to add Tamil tag is fine. But commanding to give the English
translation is suppressive & biased.
The guidelines need to be revised if it's true that this mailing list gives
equal freedom for all.

Friends.

We always welcome mails in tamil.
But with a translation.

Everyone in the list have same rights.
It is non-ethical to discuss something
where some people see only boxes, question marks, non readable characters.

It means they are prohibited to read the mails in the list.

No one has the authority to prevent the readers from getting the information.
This basic right of getting information should be maintained for all
the list members.


Please give a solution to maintain the basic rights of all people.

Giving English translation is a nice solution.
If you can not do all the times, it is illegal to ask people
to bear the boxes and question marks.

As you know more about freedom, please
give a solution to the list members to know the information from the
tamil mails.

We have the following requirement.
We should know the information from the tamil mails,
without searching for a tamil known person to read the mails.

Any solution from you?

To avoid boxes, question marks and non readable characters - either install
Tamil fonts or filter out mails with [Tamil] tag. That is a one time task
and the mails will not bother in future.

If Tamil mails are not allowed, that information will not be generated at
all. Then where is the question of "preventing the readers from the getting
information", if Tamil discussions are not taking place, everyone loses.

For boxes and question marks use filtering of [Tamil] tagged mails and get
on with the regular English mails (which will continue as now).

What we seek is to generate more discussions and more participation by
having Tamil communication as an option.  This will be over and above what
is taking place now.


> We have the following requirement.
> We should know the information from the tamil mails,

If Tamil discussions do not take place, that information is simply not
available. In that case everyone loses. Without English translation, only
some people fail to get the information.

Even for that, there are interested list members who are willing and
volunteering to translate. But that should not be in the guidelines for the
poster.

You would do it only to make a point, not in day to day communication.

Please understand that whoever sends a message to the list, wants it to be
read by as many people as possible. It is in the interest of the sender to
reach as many people as possible.

Writing in Tamil loses the attention of many non-Tamil list members, that is
the sacrifice the sender is willing to take, to reach better to some other
group in the list.

Only when it is felt that a particular language (in this case Tamil) will be
received by many persons, one will write in that language.

What is the point in writing if there is no one else who will understand,
benefit and respond to it.  You will have not motivation to write.

Ma Sivakumar

Hi,

Today in The Times of India it was published that a company has made a
font for the new Rupee symbol in .ttf format. The link is:
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Heres-how-to-download-new-rupee-symbol-for-free/articleshow/6182289.cms

Then I read Gaurav Paliwal's article on how to use the  same on
Linux:http://bit.ly/cnWYQO

I searched wikipedia & found ttf is a proprietary format. Lets create
a font using FreeType2 or other open format. We can use SVG to
generate the vector image. There is a web based editor SVGedit:
code.google.com/p/svg-edit
or search SVGedit on Wikipedia.

Hi,
Let's look at it this way.
If I were born and grown in chennai.But my mother tongue is Bengali.I dont know tamil reading and writing.
Me and my friends are willing to discuss?Foss related topics in this list in our mother tongue Bengali.
A lot of our bengali people are in list and?We assure that we can generate much content in bengali.This will be so useful to the mass of bengali people living in chennai.
Hope Chennai is not only for tamil people and?ILUGC is not only for tamil members.
As Tamil people has the previleges to post in tamil,we, the bengali members think that we too have the rightsto discuss in bengali.
Please note that we can not translate in englishas it will double the work and will give much pains to fingers and brain.If requested, we can add [Bengali] Tag in the subject.
Our Hindi, Telugu and Gujarathi friends also willingto discuss in thier own languages in the list.
"Infact, lets consider loads of other people who will start posting in every dialect and language available in the country."
"So, everyone can either install ALL fonts and hmm or create 100's of filters to move them to Trash."

"Finally, you know guys, which posts will be understood by all. It will be the English posts"

We hope that there is no need for any request and we can start postingin Bengali.

PS : Is there any need that we should obey the list guidelines?Can I start replying in Bengali too?

ThanksKrish

I propose Every ILUG have a Indic translation cell at the national
level who are honoured financially and otherwise for their efforts as
per the member's opinions and metrics.

I think this thread should end here and start a new communty
beneficial open economic model.

Let language battles begin to end here in the free, open souce, well
an open, community.

Period.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT]RMS on Mono, DotGNU (from foss news-34)
Message-ID: <AANLkTimClS1EI3Pz4u_cenXsfGlnRf_d32XqJ-JZ1L0f@mail.gmail.com>

All,

It was interesting to read RMS's take on Mono, DotGNU and the whole
Microsoft's patents on .Net CLI runtime.

<short story>
Use the C# code implementations in a free platform (Mono, DotGNU) but
don't create new code in it. Just like mp3 - consume mp3 in free
players, but don't encode.
</short story>

It is no news that RMS has termed Miguel de Icaza - the person behind
Mono (who was also behind GNOME) as a "traitor to the free software
community" for being part of the Mono project.

I'm a fan of .Net platform. I personally feel Mono runtime is an
awesome experiment to bring C# into non-Microsoft platforms. C# as
such is a wonderful language and would love to see a complete .Net 4.0
runtime implemented in Mono (currently Mono is fully compatible with
.Net 2.0 and some specifications of .Net 3.0). The interesting side
effect with mono runtime is that with little effort it was possible to
bring *other* .Net languages to Linux such as F# and Visual Basic.
With Miguel in the forefront Mono runtime is bound for some big
things.

With Moonlight (Silverlight in Mono) and Monotouch (.Net platform for
iPhone and iOS 4!) the Mono suite gets really exciting.

I would like to hear from ILUG-C about their take on Mono runtime and
whether what Miguel did is useful or not. Please discuss..

P.S: Lets talk in technology!

Thanks,
Balaji

Patents are not a purely technology issue.  While C# might indeed be a
good language,  if the technology stack is patent encumbered, adoption
of it will be hindered.  Another important issue is whether
people/companies funding Mono are running a profitable business to
ensure sustainability of the platform.  Unclear whether that is the case
as of now.

We have adobe flash which can perform better then html5 in some cases. But
we advocate for html5 which open. Same thing apply with Mono/C#
Probably "Mono is a danger" by RMS will tell you some reason.
I am very far from Microsoft iceland so I cannot talk on their technology
much.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29 Page say the
license is "CLR propitiatory" This is not opensource.

One news worthy event that happened on July 17th is that, the licenses
of DLR (dynamic language runtime), IronRuby and IronPython has changed
from MS-PL to Apache-2[1]

Microsoft has further released parts of the .Net framework code in
open source (some in MS-PL and some in Apache 2) - this includes
Sliverlight controls, Microsoft's AJAX and ASP MVC.[2] - These will be
available in Mono 2.8

Microsoft so far hasn't pounced on Mono like they did with SalesForce.
Infact, Miguel got the Microsoft MVP award in 2010.

About the profitability and adaptability of Mono, this might be a
totally different thing, looks time Mono is at least claiming that it
is being well adopted [3]. I guess Ubuntu still ships with Tomboy
Notes installed (not sure) which means that they aren't gravely
concerned. Not sure about Fedora, as I used only Fedora KDE.

Yes, this is indeed a good move but one must understand the core
technologies it relies on are still not under a open source license.  If
Microsoft chooses to release it under a license like Apache which
includes explicit patent grants,  then it would resolve the patent debate.

See the history of the MP3 or GIF format to understand why this is not a
assurance at all.

Being well adopted and profitable are two different things.   Fedora
does not include any mono apps by default.  What is included is Gnote, 
Shotwell etc.  Ubuntu is replacing F-Spot by Shotwell in their next
release.  I would also note that Beagle has become unmaintained and the
latest release of openSUSE replaces it by Tracker.    The amount of
adoption seems to be getting lower in fact.

"They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety,
deserve neither liberty nor safety." (
http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin ).

Sometime back Microsoft's open source efforts were highlighted.
http://www.microsoft.com/opensource/faq-all.aspx

10 years back Open Source was a "virus to be shunned by all". What changed
now? Success of the movement and Microsoft's failure to kill it. Now, they
want to selectively do some open source activities to retain their monopoly
in Desktop operating system business.

.Net and C# can be wonderful. Why, VB was wonderful to develop desktop
applications in Windows, IE is wonderful browser to make web applications if
you are willing to disregard standards.

Consider that Microsoft could not play nice where they have the dominance.
They want to adjust a little to strengthen themselves where they are weak.

As you summarised, Mono's purpose is to run .Net applications developed
elsewhere. Spending time developing new applications in .Net by open source
community is taking away mind share from alternatives with open standards
and Free licences.

Not only bengali people living in Chennai, all Bengali people in other
parts of world will also benefit. When a Bengali student wants to
learn something technical he can reach your contents (through google
search) and benefit.

That will make ILUGC a truly rainbow list representing the whole of
India. If we can pull off this successfully, that will be a remarkable
achievement.

I am able to view
1. English

Why 100's of filters? How many languages you think will be used in the

at the most? A few more? Why you exaggerate to 100's?

1. Sorry about that. I use this google account of mine for interacting

Tamil. I will find out how to change the sending name in Gmail (for

I have no interest in political part of this issue, for the reasons 
outlined below. But, I would admit that at several instances Miguel's 
statements disappointed me. I won't use such strong language to describe 
him for sure, but having seen him and Nat (Friedman) present a brilliant 
presentation on Mono all the way back in 2003 Foss.in (in its earlier 
avatar, of course). I was quite disappointed the way it all turned out.

I'd have to disagree, really. As far as I can remember, the real reason 
why Miguel and Nat started working on Mono (as stated in their 
presentation) was that they were worried that there wasn't truly useful 
RAD-style development environment for Linux (both for desktop and 
webapps) at that point of time. Meanwhile, MS was supposedly going to 
take over the world with its new-fangled .Net thingy. The idea was to 
implement .Net CLR in Linux, and create a whole toolset around it (which 
led to MonoDevelop, I believe).

In other words, the whole of Mono project came about because people 
feared MS was going to take over the technology world (I suppose it 
seemed real enough in early part of the century). But the patent issues 
would always stalk it, and not everybody bought into the Mono vision 
that we have to re-implement MS standards, with a good amount of 
skepticism that we're ultimately serving MS' agenda after all.

> With Moonlight (Silverlight in Mono) and Monotouch (.Net platform for

As somebody already pointed out before, why do we have to bother with 
extending a single company's strangle-hold over any part of technology 
stack? Be it MS or Adobe, open technologies now have enough weight and 
momentum to drive their own standards (Flash vs HTML5/Canvas). With a 
lot of enlightened companies like Google (ok, in their own self-interest 
of course) truly embracing the open technology platforms, why bother 
with backward-looking, proprietary software sanctioned by a single 
company? Coming to Monotouch, is it even legal to make apps with it, 
given the dreaded Section 3.3.1 of Apple Developer License agreement? 
Which kind of rounds out my argument in favor of not 
supporting/re-implementing proprietary platforms - companies like Apple 
can turn around and screw you in the end, no matter their love of all 
things open.


> P.S: Lets talk in technology!
>
>    

Sorry I didn't talk purely technology - by asking to comment on Miguel's 
actions/motivations, you also made it a subjective/political issue - but 
these issues indeed go beyond the technical merits/non-merits of the 
platforms or intentions or actions of a single person - however 
influential they are. We believe in open source for a reason, and 
trusting technology companies not to look out for their own interests in 
the end, over and above whatever their professed love for developers and 
their interests in these days (after so many scary stories) is being 
extremely naive.

Actually, the rest of your mail seems to acknowledge and endorse that

Oops, you're right - guess I meant to say I can't make a statement about 
what exactly Miguel's motivations are, as we can only speculate about 
them - but I am willing to consider it folly rather than malice, as he 
and Nat seemed to be genuinely excited about what they're building. 
Perhaps they didn't have enough faith that the open source movement is 
capable of innovating and driving standards against something as 
powerful as Microsoft. That's probably the only explanation I can give 
for it. Again, it's just speculation.

As for the rest of the mail, I've always considered FOSS more of a 
personal opinion/values issue rather than overtly political, but when 
we're advocating it, I guess it becomes political indeed :)

Isn't that how most of the opensource projects begin? (I might be on a
limbo here, but I agree that there are first class ideas in oss
projects also)

I'm not an authority on deciding which technology to use in business.
Probably, if I have my own company I may not choose the .Net stack. My
views were only from a developer's perspective of some of the features
given by a language. Like a kid standing in front of a candy shop. Why
should being a opensource developer stop one from learning the stack,
after all we are developers in first place.

With people like Eric Meijer and Don Syme in the team - .Net stack has
got some remarkable features such as LINQ, lambda expressions,
covariants & contravariants, type inference which the Java world is
still dreaming out. Porting F# as a first class language on .net
platform is also a boost to the functional programming community. My
thoughts were only to bring these features to Linux.

Apple is using 3.3.1 selectively. There are still a lot of
cross-compiled code in app store that was built using mono and other
similar tools. But I agree with you on this that we can't develop
applications on monotouch and just pray that Apple will somehow make
it available in app store.

yeah, my bad. Just wanted to say that 'in this thread, we don't talk
language, we talk technology' - but it wasn't technology and wasn't

Though I am interested in conversing in Hindi, I'm sad that this issue is

It might have been the case before, but increasingly, at least in the 
area that I'm involved in (web development) the rate of innovation in 
the open source projects (especially web servers/frameworks) is really 
out-stripping the proprietary variants. I'm optimistic enough to hope 
that it will spread to other parts of the technology ecosystem. What I'm 
trying to say is, if somebody starts tries to start something like Mono 
now, they will be rightly looked at as behind the times. There's simply 
no need for that kind of paranoia now. Innovation and FOSS go together 
very well, and it's been proven plenty of times now.

Of course you're free to choose what you want to learn. But if you want 
it to grow into something of a career, even as a developer you have to 
be careful what you choose. I'm just pointing out that .Net might have a 
lot of goodies you are excited about, but perhaps your time is better 
spent looking at alternatives in the FOSS world where the pace of 
innovation is far more rapid, and longevity of your skillsets depends 
solely on the language's merits and adoption, not on a company's ability 
to control markets, which might or might not be sustainable in the long run.

Sounds like fun - but are you absolutely sure that there are no FOSS 
alternatives available that lets you play with those language features? 
There are plenty of functional languages that are implementing cutting 
edge PL research (I'm a bit of a PL geek myself, and I still remember 
the long rants and vain attempts of Jon Harrop trying to convince 
comp.lang.lisp audience how F# is better than Common Lisp, but I doubt 
if he won any real converts, except ending up alienating the whole of 
c.l.l being termed a troll :). I do remember hearing that Qi has some of 
those features, but you have to do your own research in that aspect. All 
I'm trying to point out is, your time is probably more worthwhile and 
might avoid nasty surprises down the road if you stay clear of languages 
promoted by companies with a history as that of Microsoft.

The whole point of 3.3.1 is to be able to use it selectively, I think 
:). Granted that I lost most of my respect for Apple for quite some 
time, but you only have to read some of the horror stories of indie 
developers who have invested so much time and money into writing an 
iPhone app, only to be yanked out of App Store because it's either 
conflicts with Apple's world-view or more narrowly, their revenue 
stream. Do you really want to be part of that kind of paranoid 
environment where so much rides on whether or not Apple (or some other 
3rd party) thinks highly of your app? Finally, as a developer, that's a 
call you have to make. I'm guessing for most of us in this forum, taking 
permission from the likes of Apple for doing what we love to do is 
simply not an option :)

Why are you asking coordinator. He already said you can post any language

translate it English.

True. So then, no one other than people who know bengali are going to benefit from them. Same goes for any mono languaged post.

Well then, why exclude us from understanding good discussions that may happen by writing in language only that is not understood by us.And not caring to provide an English translation.

Oh yeah, but I can't tell the difference between few language fonts. So are many other people. It will be a rainbow but people will look at selected colors only.

Nice. But I am not installing more fonts on my machine. Btw, I cant read 6, 7, 8, 9... So I do not know which language is which.

Why are you considering only 6 languages. You yourself listed 9. Why other language people do not have rights? Or is there a restriction?
100 was an understatement. ... Here's a quote from article?"The Indian census of 1961 recognised 1,652 different languages in India"

Not really.1. Not arguing
2. Its a voice to tell you guys that when you post in "only Tamil" ?lot of people feel excluded from the dicussion even though we want to learn of interesting things that may have been discussed in the post..
3. I am not denying right to post in Tamil, but supporting the nice behavior of?courtesy to provide a short english summary in the same post, so that we don't feel excluded and it benefits all.
4. If everyone goes makes small small groups inside ilugc for discussing only in their language, then it beats the whole purpose of ILUG - "Indian Linux User Group" - Chennai.Please do not make it "Chennai Linux User Group - India"?
5.

Why no body seems to understand the fact that we are not sending "General
ILUGC" emails in Tamil, but we are sending only the emails related to
Tamil-Courses / Translations in Tamil.

A translated course-work in Tamil is obviously of less interest to a
Non-Tamil reader. So, they can happily filter it out using a "[Tamil]"
filter.

No one is preventing rights of readers to know what they need to know. If a
Hind-related stuff is discussed in Hindi on this list, i would happily
filter it out. I don't feel anything bad in doing so.

I completely agree to this. Discussing about a tamil-related work in Tamil
(which is already translated from English) is possible. Again this needs to
be translated to English in Email - is unacceptable.

Dear Sir,

Please avoid sarcastic comments.

We are talking about ilugc which stands for Indian Linux User Group - Chennai

1. Chennai in the name leads to posts in Tamil.
2. Indian in the name leads to request to post in other Indian
languages (including Urdu)

Do not deny legitimate rights of people by resorting to extreme arguments.

Thanks for putting your feeling very clearly. I understand your

No, I also think the same way.

Some of the members (including coordinator) have misunderstood communication
part. Their view is "Not all people can benefit if they don't understand."
Let me counter it in two points:

1.  If People aren't allowed to post in Tamil(or malayalam/hindhi) don't
think they will post in English. They may not post at all. Many people are
only reading in this list because they can understand English whereas it is
difficult for them to write a decent English note and they don't want to be
seen writing like that in a public list. Imagine what would happen if
Thirukural wasn't published because they wouldn't let Thiruvalluvar publish
in Tamil? Then No one would have got that information.

2. As somebody told already, you cannot expect Thiruvalluvar/kamban to
provide a translation just because you don't know Tamil. Agreed that you
have to go to shop to see those books but you are getting mails
automatically in your inbox. Only because of this we agreed for a tag.
Expecting translation "is suppessive & biased" IMO.

Understood - which is why I added "in its earlier avatar". I do realize 
there was some controversy about it, about which I really don't know 
much apart from the fact that the same set of people renamed it into 
foss.in later on. At least that's what I thought.

anyway from today I am filtering out mails with [TAMIL] or [Tamil] tag - I am 
very sad to do this as I feel it is an insult to an Indian language to have to 
filter on it, but I do not think that the motives of the people posting in 
tamil are correct. For example if you look at fsm.co.in - which is a business 
website run by the 'Tamil heroes' on this list, you will understand how much 
love they have for Tamil. I will continue to post in Tamil lists.

Looks like you have missed the point . 
Script identifies with a language. 
I was not talking of any official languages used, rather the ones that are more commonly used.
When I said min 100 , I meant that It is no point in giving a speech to an empty hall.

I think it is important to understand the necessity for localisation.
The APDIP had published some documents in this regard
http://www.apdip.net/news/foss-guide-to-localization  In short,
1. it is to encourage local language computing.
2. local language computing ensures that non-English speaking people
are empowered.
To get the statistics, of the 66% literate population in India only 5%
can communicate in English.

You then have more technology oriented business transactions in the
local language.  This then creates a strong local economy.  This means
that if Wall Street and other corresponding streets crash we are still
secure from the tidal wave.

That should be your biggest motivation to support l10n.

AFAIK the mails are now being tagged so one has the freedom to
identify and do the needful as per ones interests.  So why should
ILUGC die?  It is in fact going to become more popular.

Fracturing a group is not a solution.  Forking in a FOSS project is
adopted as a worst case scenario.
I appreciate the spirit of healthy discussion in this group.

I hope that you will live and let live.

no. For example Tulu, Kodava and Kannada are all written in the Kannada 
script. Konkani is written in Malayalam script in Kasargod, Kannada script in 
Karnataka, and roman and devnagiri script in Goa. Bhojpuri, Maithili, 
Chatisgarhi and many other north Indian languages are written in devnagiri 
script

I am also a part of the team, fsm.co.in will be a bilingual portal very soon.
And you might have noticed that "kattatra menporul" book also sold
there. There are other entites in which even we have designed the logo
to be in tamil.
This list will know about those in future. Thanks for your critics
that only motivates us to do that translation part at the earliest.



The work is in progress.

I am also know necessity for localization and local language computing.
That why I am myself  trying to translate one of the open source astrology
tool to Tamil.

But what I am  trying to say is : Here  lot of people are sharing their
technical skill, learning each other in English because lots of people they
don't know Tamil (OR somebody may not interested).

That why all of us saying to start separate group , so that interesting
people  will  contribute including me.

I don't think so. This kind of not technical fights on technical mailing
list never bring more technical  people to ILUGC. I already know six people
went out from ilugc.

I don't want to argue with you. I stop here my discussion in this thread.

The options for those who do not want to be a part of certain
discussions are quite clear.
We adopted English for certain reasons which may be valid or not but
this is not the forum for that discussion.

Experience shows that this option does not always work well.

ILUGC == FOSS == local language computing == related discussions in

Yes. Things are related.

Message-ID: <AANLkTin58_oF2Y0MYpYdf8b418I9EjVlp2iKVO_zgdH7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
     I am looking for volunteers to translate
http://translate.sugarlabs.org/ta/  , looking at the work so far more that
90 % is already been done, i can use Google to translate and do remaining ,
but i am handicapped i am neither Tamil nor can i read the script , so
wanted somebody either to finish off with the strings or help me with
validations as to how the trasalations are so far.

Yes i am trying my luck with  fishing with the Tamil wave on this list  on
the high thought would also get some work done in the process :-) .


TIA

Good one :)

On a similar note . could someone get  the no of strings in the below
projects up ?
http://l10n.kde.org/stats/gui/trunk-kde4/team/ta/koffice/   35 %
http://l10n.kde.org/stats/gui/trunk-kde4/team/ta/kdeedu/  15 %
http://l10n.kde.org/stats/gui/trunk-kde4/team/ta/kdegames/ 20 %

Also a review of the existing translations and a removal of fuzzy
strings is appreciated.

Localisation includes much more than translation . Tuxpaint a drawing
program for kids can be localised with its stamp collection .
http://www.tuxpaint.org/stamps/
You can add tamil sounds and more localised stamps.

The translations for the application are almost done and can be
reviewed at ftp://ftp.billsgames.com/unix/x/tuxpaint/source/po/ta.po

I agree to this. Let me take the context English and Tamil.If every
non-english(or tamil) posters are requested to provide english translation,
then how about the non-tamil (or english ) posters, will they be asked to
provide respective tamil translation for the tamil readers(atleast, who do
not understand english) ?

I hope to see tamil people to discuss needed things in tamil, without
spending much time for english translation.

You are there. 
Kannada script is "primarily" identified with the language Kannada. 
The script is also used by the languages of Tulu, Kodava etc.
When you mention a language, it includes the script (if it has one).

I usually ignore your mails because they are often impatient, immature and
aggressive, this one is not an exception.

FSM is run by a well known person in this list, often recognized for his
FOSS Tamil computing contribution, you can't deny that of course he is a
hero in that context.

I request you not to mess up personal interest with business.

In short you seem to lack the maturity of expressing thougths in a right
way. Your earlier post confirms the same.

Please look at the Latin American countries where FOSS is encouraged.
In India, look at Kerala.
In fact you need to read the documents available on the link I sent before
from the United Nations Development Project(UNDP)

This is something I wrote quite some time ago and is still valid (more maths)

Hi,

I am looking for light weight graphichs library for developing
the embedded application. I require to perform the below
1)draw the pixel(or line) graph.
2)display the live video (video camera connected to the board)
3)user interface for configuration (with few user interface buttons such
as text box, radio button etc).

Please suggest some light weight opensource graphic library for this purpose.

Tried QT, openGL ES and looks like those are heavy(in terms of understanding
the library, development, processing) for my requirements.
Currently I am evaluating the directFB.

Please let me know which is more suitable for my requirements.

Thanks
Suresh

Hi Suresh,
Have you taken a look at EFL[1] (Enlightenment Foundation Library).
Without any skinning, it is quite fast.

Of course, if X is turning out to be the bottleneck, directfb may be
the way to go.

as a new feature, I have added option to view the matter in the website in

is possible for a person to enter the matter in any of the languages, and 
provide a translation also if he wants. I have translated one page as an

Manzanar  es el m?s conocido de los diez campos donde m?s de 110 000
nikkei  estadounidenses fueron encarcelados durante la Segunda Guerra
Mundial. Est? ubicado a los pies de la Sierra Nevada en el Valle
Owens, California, y entre los poblados de Lone Pine al sur e
Independence al norte, aproximadamente a 370 kil?metros al noreste de
Los ?ngeles. Manzanar ha sido identificado por el Servicio de Parques
Nacionales  de los Estados Unidos como el campo mejor conservado de
este tipo, por lo que fue nombrado Sitio Hist?rico Nacional Manzanar
(Manzanar National Historic Site).

Mucho antes de que los primeros prisioneros llegaran al lugar, en
marzo de 1942, Manzanar era el hogar de pueblos nativos, quienes
principalmente viv?an en aldeas ubicadas en varios de los arroyos
cercanos del ?rea. Rancheros y mineros se establecieron formalmente en
Manzanar en 1910, pero abandonaron el pueblo en 1929 despu?s de que la
ciudad de Los ?ngeles comprara los derechos del agua de pr?cticamente
toda el ?rea. A pesar de las diferencias de estos grupos, sus
historias tienen en com?n la amenaza del traslado forzado.

Henricus Jacobus Jut (19 juli 1851 ? 12 juni 1878) was een 19e-eeuwse
moordenaar uit Den Haag.

Op 13 december 1872 toog hij samen met zijn vrouw naar het huis van
mevrouw Van der Kouwen aan de Bocht van Guinee te Den Haag en stak
zowel haar als haar nieuwe dienstbode dood. Ze gingen er met alle
juwelen en waardepapieren vandoor. Moord was toentertijd in Nederland
een zeldzaamheid en een dubbele moord was al helemaal uitzonderlijk.
Jut kreeg levenslang voor dubbele moord. Twee jaar later, op 12 juni
1878, overleed hij.

Een kermisexploitant bedacht een attractie met de naam Kop van Jut
waarop de mensen met mokerslagen hun woede konden afreageren. De ?chte
'kop' van Jut werd na zijn dood op sterk water gezet en is jarenlang
te zien geweest in het anatomisch museum van de Rijksuniversiteit
Groningen.

O Templo Expiat?rio da Sagrada Fam?lia, tamb?m conhecido simplesmente
como Sagrada Fam?lia, ? um grande templo cat?lico  da cidade catal? de
Barcelona  (Espanha), desenhado pelo arquiteto catal?o  Antoni Gaud?,
e considerado por muitos cr?ticos como a sua obra-prima e expoente da
arquitetura modernista catal?. Financiado unicamente por contribui??es
privadas, o projeto foi iniciado em 1882 e assumido por Gaud? em 1883,
quando tinha 31 anos de idade, dedicando-lhe os seus ?ltimos 40 anos
de vida, os ?ltimos quinze de forma exclusiva. A constru??o foi
suspensa em 1936 devido ? Guerra Civil Espanhola e n?o se estima a
conclus?o para antes de 2026, centen?rio da morte de Gaud?. No momento
presente o m?s de setembro de 2010 ? apontado para a conclus?o do
interior e abertura ao culto e visitas.
A constru??o come?ou em estilo neog?tico, mas o projeto foi
reformulado completamente por Gaud? ao assumi-lo. O templo foi
projetado para ter tr?s grandes fachadas: a Fachada da Natividade,
quase terminada com Gaud? ainda em vida, a Fachada da Paix?o, iniciada
em 1952, e a Fachada da Gl?ria, ainda por completar. Segundo o seu
proceder habitual, a partir de esbo?os gerais do edif?cio Gaud?
improvisou a constru??o ? medida que esta avan?ava. O templo, quando
estiver terminado, dispor? de 18 torres: quatro em cada uma das tr?s
entradas-portais, a jeito de c?pulas; ir? ter um sistema de seis
torres, com a torre do zimb?rio central dedicada a Jesus Cristo, de
170 metros de altura, outras quatro ao redor desta, dedicadas aos
evangelistas, e um segundo zimb?rio dedicado ? Virgem. (leia mais...)

Vetrina L'affondamento della corazzata Prince of Wales e
dell'incrociatore da battaglia Repulse, il 10 dicembre 1941, fu uno
degli episodi pi? disastrosi e controversi per gli Alleati dell'inizio
della seconda guerra mondiale nel Pacifico. Esso fu compiuto da aerei
dell'aviazione navale nipponica  che, in diverse ondate, colpirono le
due navi causandone il tragico affondamento, con elevate perdite umane
da parte britannica; i cacciatorpediniere di scorta rimasti, HMS
Electra, Express e Vampire (dopo che al Tenedos, a causa di scarsit?
di carburante era stato ordinato di tornare all'ancoraggio di
Singapore), riuscirono comunque a recuperare molti superstiti.

In Giappone l'episodio ? conosciuto come battaglia navale al largo
della Malacca (??????, Mare-oki kaisen).

Une naine blanche est, en astronomie, le nom donn? ? ce qu'il advient
d'une ?toile de masse mod?r?e (de 8 ? 10 masses solaires au maximum) ?
l'issue de la phase o? se produisent des r?actions thermonucl?aires.
Ces objets acqui?rent alors une taille tr?s petite comparativement ?
une ?toile, et conservent longtemps une temp?rature  de surface
?lev?e, d'o? leur nom de ? naine blanche ?.

Une naine blanche poss?de typiquement une masse inf?rieure quoique
comparable ? celle du Soleil pour un volume similaire ? celui de la
Terre. Sa densit? est ainsi de l?ordre d?une tonne par centim?tre
cube, plusieurs dizaines de milliers de fois plus ?lev?e que celle des
mat?riaux observ?s sur Terre. Sa temp?rature de surface, qui peut
d?passer au d?part 100 000 kelvins, provient de la chaleur emmagasin?e
par son ?toile parente, chaleur qui ne diffuse que tr?s lentement du
fait de la faible surface de l'astre. C'est aussi du fait de cette
faible surface que, malgr? sa temp?rature ?lev?e, la luminosit? d'une
naine blanche reste limit?e ? une valeur de l?ordre d?un milli?me de
luminosit? solaire, et d?cro?t au cours du temps.

On estime que les naines blanches constituent approximativement 6 % en
nombre de l'ensemble des ?toiles connues dans le voisinage solaire,
mais ?tant donn? la raret? des ?toiles de grande masse, elles
repr?sentent le destin de 97 % des ?toiles de notre galaxie.

So, does this mean, using a [language] tag may not be the best solution?

I agree that you are very clever. Please stop doing these kind of stuff. If
there are really significant  french or german or russian knowing population
in this list and *YOU* know these languages it is justified to ask and
answer questions in those languages. Just because you are clever enough to
use google translate or copy-paste from some Russian language site, sending

You aren't helping language discussion by doing so. *No, we won't agree
these mails as valid response/reason not to send mails in Tamil.* I've been

The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It has a
diameter of about 1,392,000 kilometers (865,000 mi), about 109 times
that of Earth, and its mass (about 2 ? 1030 kilograms, 330,000 times
that of Earth) accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the
Solar System.

Better follow this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun for the rest of the email.

This means Victor did not like the solution of using tags as proposed
and thinks he can sabotage this list with SPAM. He is sending random
mails with random language tags, because, I think, he didn't like the
idea that some people will post here in Tamil.

Victor,

You missed adding a language tag and which violates list guidelines.
Please add correct language tags for your mails. Also please be on
topic, we are not interested to hear about Solar System in this list.

This is like kids game now, many email threads on a narrowed subject just 
spoiled down the mood and vanished what the list was intending to do 
for the last few days. I rarely hear "linux for humans", "device drivers", "my mobile
not detected in fedora", "school OS", "open source software development" etc. these
days rather only "linguistic" echo!

Just look at the valuable human hours collectively spent (from drafting to reading 
all these emails), now think of spending the same amount time in other way, atleast 
spending time on interacting the list's wish (aka) F/OSS vision with your neighbours, 
friends, fellow peers/classmates etc would have been a worthy thing than what we did here. 

It's perfect time for the moderator to step in and get things "on track" and I hope 
Shrini will do it soon.

spaming this list and is not asking/spreading any computer/ Free software

it's one of the "spam" in the series of translations which were sent by OP.
If you happened to see the email archive, it's more of commanding than requests

I perfectly understood the idea behind the spam :)

My question was slightly different though. For instance, I looked only
at this email since it said telugu. So, would it not irritate people
to tag a mail as tamil and write some other language in there? Many
would just have a filter to bypass the email to trash. But the few
interested would not like it, right?

Oh no, lets not pick on this. It is largely pointless.

Let better senses prevail.

Last few days on this list has taught us a lot about human egos.

I am not sure, but you might be better off using a higher level graphics sub
system (read with X) because you want to show live video. To show high frame
rates you might have to depend on low level hardware ops which would have
already been implemented for you if you chose a higher level graphics
platform. Of course this luxury might not be there for you since you are
talking about an embedded system.

Dear Victor

You are so worried about spending / wasting other people's time and by doing
all these - you are actually doing the same, with anger.

Any good deed which is done with anger / irritation / emotion gets the same.

I would have preferred you doing simply what other members been doing - just
putting your point - simply.

You are really wasting a lot of other people's time.

I am not contributing to ILUGC in any way - but i am simple user of LINUX -
for my deeds, and I sincerely appreciate and thank all those who were
magnanimous enough to give their work to all of us. I do not know whether I
deserve this opportunity to comment on others.

May be I not putting my view properly - forgive me for this.  I REQUEST you
not to proceed more on this.

thanks

SABDFL aka list admin / owner speaks

I have been a member of this list since before it was created - starting with 
adding group aliases. I have always followed the practice of letting the list 
decide its own policies; it has worked out well so far and I dont see any 
reason it cant continue to. Bigger and more affluent groups have come and 
gone, but we will go on for ever. Occasionally, it appears, I have to step in 
and nudge the group in some direction. The multilingual 'debate' has gotten 
out of hand. This list was started with English as the principal language and 
unless a majority or at least a large fraction want to change that, it will 
not change; large fraction to be viewed in the context of total list 
membership which is almost 2300 now. I have already offered, and so has MIT, 
to host new list(s) for specific language interests. Chauvinism and jingoism 
of any kind have no place in this list. I will remove the emergency moderation 
in about 8 hours from now (=1200 hrs UTC = 1730 IST). I would request members 
to not post in any language other than English, with or without language tags. 
If any list member wants ilugc.tamil or ilguc.telugu or ilugc.finnish or 
ilugc.tulu or whatever, please send mail to me (list owner) and not to the 
list. Any post (or attempt to post) in other than English to the list will be 
treated as a request to open a language specific ilugc and I will create a 
separate list. I will send an announcement about the creation of every such 
new list to ilugc along with the id of the requester who can thence claim 
credit to be the creator of the new list. A second and any further attempts by 
any user to post in a language other than English to ilugc (with or without 
language tags) will result in individual moderation, short term suspension and 
kick-off.

Anyone disagreeing with this policy is welcome to propose sensible 
alternatives. Let us all have the good sense to let the list live long and 
prosper.

Sriram (the old and original)

dear friends:
FOSS propagation has multiple aspects. While many of the active LUG members
would like to have "correct" FOSS inducted in "correct" manner, the ground
realities have to be taken into account.

At the outset, FOSS cannot be a "subject" in the strict curriculum sense.
The concept of knowledge sharing, collaborative work  (which were once
hallmark points in academia and research) have yielded to the pressure of
scoring marks, getting projects ... FOSS awareness could bring back the good
values!

Specifically, if we think of engineering curricula, FOSS concepts
(collaborative development) could be the focus for CSE/IT, while ECE/MECH
and other branches could concentrate on using & contributing to FOSS
alternatives for the proprietary they use. Biotechnology (esp in Arts &
Science colleges) uses open sources heavily -- Linux, Python are regular
papers for their Masters programmes.

The universities also have their own norms -- in anna univ, a new subject
had to be introduced as elective (theory!!) and then could grow. the rule
might be getting changed now. Anna Univ Coimbatore has introduced FOSS as
core paper. If you think 45 hrs / theory (or practical) etc., restrictions
is ridiculous teach FOSS, please remember that the restrictions are also
hampering  many other subjects. There is (hopefully was) a rule that a
theory subject should have one specified textbook (at most two). We had 1
hour discussion in a syllabus committee meeting that this is ridiculous for
subjects like software practices, software testing, etc.

What NRCFOSS (and various academicians) are trying is to breach the
proprietary wall in whichever reasonable way possible -- i hope we realise
that the awareness level in 2004-05 was much less compared to what is now.

My suggestion : let us continue to introduce subjects in the curriculum
subject to university norms, introduce FOSS alternatives in labs, draw the
students towards FOSS usage/projects, try to remove the restrictive clauses
like only specific software should be used, and be ready to take advantage
of the changing scenarios.

Often, it may be the local professor/lecturer/student groups who will have
to brave the scenario, and FOSS community / NRCFOSS & related agencies
should be willing to pitch in.

I apologise for the long msg and let me conclude with the example of Jaya
Engg College : when they introduced FOSS elective in 2005-06, the official
notification had not come, but university authorities with backup from
NRCFOSS took care of the admin aspects ; AU-KBC (& CDAC) to certain extent,
and ILUGC members in great measures ensured that their FOSS club activities
flourished. Their students did well in exams and some of them also
contributed to the FOSS repository. Of course, the backbone was Prof Kumaran
ably supported by his enthusiastic band of students and staff (lab sessions
to teach the "theory" paper, migrating to FOSS alternatives in some the
labs, etc.).

The engg. colleges have started realising the importance of FOSS in regular
curriculum and we have interacted with more than 20 engg. colleges in the
past one month, discussing about the Open Source Lab setup and the
institutions are ready to setup FOSS labs, FDPs and make their students to
do Lab practicals/Projects using FOSS tools.

I have to test L2TP protocol using openswan and ipsec utilities for vpn
connectivity.

How do i test the above scenario on LAN(one-2-one vpn connectivity)??

my reference link is :
http://www.natecarlson.com/2006/07/10/configuring-an-ipsec-tunnel-with-openswan-and-l2tpd

I was not clear on the configuration, because it was used between two diff
LAN's via VPN.

Kindly share you experience if you any.

// Anyone disagreeing with this policy is welcome to propose sensible 
alternatives. Let us all have the good sense to let the list live long and 
prosper.//
Good policy as well as an unfortunate policy in the following sense, personally,
1) The policy failed to distinguish between genuine interests and fakes.
2) Feel that it has set a bad example, that 
despite initiating and having shown continuos considerable progress towards a particular subject related to Free and Open source software for few years now in this list (in this case FOSS in Tamil), 
someone having aversion (for reasons known only to them) towards that subject can gather mob  & create noise, that will make the co-ordinators get down to their kneels to satisy them, forgetting all other factors.
Anyhow, respecting the policy & awaiting a new announcement for an ilugc-tamil mailing list.

I did many projects in audacity but after kdenlive installation, I could not

If it is broadcom, doing something like this -
http://www.stylesen.org/configuring_wireless_bcm4310_uart_card_in_debian_etch_amd64_using_ndiswrapper
may help. But I havent tested this recently and the fact is this is an
old workaround I managed to do.

Yes. Unfortunate but no better solution exist AFAIK. But my complaint is:
Why is that Victor who, instead of making constructive criticisms, created
noise and spam and behaved irresponsibly still allowed in this list?
shouldn't he have been banned?

But consensus reached in the earlier discussion was to allow Tamil
mails with tags.

So it seems to get one's views accepted, the way is to behave irresponsibly.

Hi

I wish to convert HD video files in _mkv_ format to _mp4_ format to play on
my phone. I wish to use a FOSS tool for this purpose(on Ubuntu 9.10). Can
you please suggest some good tools which do the same without loss of clarity
from the original video?

being a newbie to ILUG, would really to like to hear and if possible solve
issues faced by other persons using FOSS tools. Talking about language is a

the benefit of all hundreds of members following the list.

+1.

It does not serve any purpose to continue arguing about this issue. As
offered by Prof Sriram, we will get a separate list set up for
discussion in Tamil. Let us continue our work in English in this list
and in Tamil in the proposed new list.

mkv is a container format.

You can simply extract the mp4 video from it using one of the mkv tools.

You need to test twidding with alsamixer and use the record program by
Gerd Knorr.

You can also use the sox rec utility.

I am looking for a video capture card (composite Audio/Video - three
wire RCA connectors - yellow, red, white) or TV Tuner card (RF) that
is supported in Linux.

Please share brand/model if you have purchased something (@ Lam Road)
within the past 6 months or so and works for you in Linux.

(I realize bttv chip set is well supported however it is difficult to
find out the chip set without opening the box which the vendors
typically do not allow).

>Dr. Srinivasan

Though I heard of FOSS Elective subject through my student Shajina K.P in 2006, I was not able to take it up in my college then. Reason being the syllabus was not put up in proper place in the Anna University website.

Again in 2008, I saw a mail in our ilugc which prompted me to contact Dr. Srinivasan (formerly NRCFOSS) and I adopted FOSS Elective subject in Rajalakshmi Engineering College. 260 students have been benefited through FOSS Elective subject in last two years. I took - 2 hours for theory and 2 hours for lab session.

CS2406 Open Source Lab has been introduced for students who have joined Engg. from 2008 onwards in VII semester. Now all Engg. college students will get benefited instead of few colleges like Rajalakshmi Engg. College and Jaya Engg. College who had their faculty members promoting FOSS Elective subject.

I congratulate NRCFOSS Team and other ilugc members who have promoted FOSS to this level.

Things to do further:
1. Students doing OOPS Lab using C++ have to do in Turbo C as stated in University Syllabus. This has to change. Instead FOSS based IDE's could be used.

CodeBlocks with gcc/g++ is a better alternative option for the above and few
engg. colleges have been using this at present.

Let's say I speak (and read) Tamil. But if there is a separate list for
Tamil and if I'm not subscribed to it, wouldn't I be missing something
interesting every now and then? I mean, if the Tamil list has something very
generic to say (something not about only Tamil FLOSS) wouldn't it be nice to
have it forwarded to *this* list?

It is a good thing not to have a full fledged Tamil discussion on this list,
but why not at least have some interesting mails (announcement/FOSS event
invites) forwarded to this one with a [tamil] tag on the subject ?

+1 on not having full fledged discussion in Tamil on this list
-1 on not having 'any' message in Tamil at all (or any other Indian
languages for that matter)
+1 on using a [tamil] tag
+1 on having a separate list for full fledged FLOSS discussions in Tamil.

Just my 2 cents.
Yogesh.

Hi, Arun,

I might have access to a Pinnacle PCTV Pro PCI card (bt878 chipset, I
believe). I gave it to a friend because I wasn't using it, but I don't
think he is either. If this is not particularly urgent, then I can send
this to you sometime in August when both my friend and I will be back in
Chennai.

I'm not sure if it is still available from retailers, but you'll find it
in abundance in second-hand markets. I also haven't tested audio on it,
but it works just fine with video (I only tested with a PAL connector
from a rooftop antenna but I've heard it also supports component video -
the yellow cable).

Good luck,

Thanks.

Welcome all those interested in discussing FOSS related topics in
Tamil to subscribe to ilugc.tamil at
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/listinfo/ilugc.tamil

Have set up some initial options for the list.  Amachu will take over
as admin of the list.

A number of challenges are to be faced and resolved (starting with
Tamil translation of Mailman - The GNU mailing list manager which runs
the mailing list).

Once again thank Prof Sriram for hosting the list at iitm-ae.

Thanks and best regards,

Ma Sivakumar

Folks,
         Some disturbing news - former Elcot MD Umashankar, who has also
given a talk at ILUG-C some years ago, seems to be in a spot of
trouble:

http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_ias-officer-suspended-by-tamil-nadu-government_1413048

There were some earlier reports of lobbying by interested parties
to shunt him out of Elcot some years ago. He's perhaps one of the
few IAS officers around who is comfortable with tech and can
even program competently.

hi,

I had configured mod_perl + apache httpd + Mason.  The set-up work's fine
for a while and then the screen goes blank all for the sudden.
When I look in the error at /var/log/httpd/error_log it says,

""Loading CGI at runtime.  You could increase shared memory between Apache
processes by preloading it in your httpd.conf or handler.pl file"".

Could any body tell me how can I fix this issue. Any pointers or links to
the solution is highly appreciated. Thank you.

Dear all

On behalf of ILUGC on 22 jul 2010 I took a session on FOSS at Vivekananda College, Mylapore. About 250 students of BCA and B.Sc Computer Science attended the session. They have agreed to Conduct an LDD sometime in September with ILUGC support.

I thank the management and faculty for the opportunity, particularly Swami Vedavidyananda for this opportunity.

Shred is not completely effective on log-structured and journaled file
systems. e.g. ext3 and ReiserFS

Not effective on RAID, Snapshot based file systems, ZFS, BTRFS etc..

Not effective on Cache based systems and applications that create a "temp
file" e.g. open office.

Not effective on Compressed file systems.

using the dd command is best to destroy data on a device.

e.g.  $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/fd0 bs=4K count=5

if ==> input file [ see below ]
of ==> output file [ your device ]

input file can be a random data file /dev/random or /dev/urandom or zero
file /dev/zero

Sad. From what I gather, he lost his scheduled caste status because of
his/family's conversion to Christianity and so lost the eligibility to the
scheduled caste quota.

Also, he made the mistake of going after Maran's TV networks.

If you pre-load all your Perl modules in the mod_perl parent process,
then every child process can share memory (RAM) with the parent
and reduce total RAM usage.  Without this, each child apache
process has to load all the modules individually into it's address
space and 1) increase RAM utilization, and 2) reduce performance.

See:
http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/performance.html#Preloading_Perl_Modules_at_Server_Startup
http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/performance.html
http://modperlbook.org/html/10-1-3-Preloading-Perl-Modules-at-Server-Startup.html


Without correct pre-loading, I've had mod_perl apps taking 800MB
RAM for every apache instance.  After correct pre-loading, the RAM
usage drops 1GB total for the entire apache mod_perl process.

Getting complex mod_perl apps to perform is a little tricky. For a
practical example, study the Request Tracker start up files and the
interaction with apache mod_perl.

mkv is a container format.

You can simply extract the mp4 video from it using one of the mkv tools.

ffmpeg is simply the best command-line tool for any kind of
video-conversion. But, i prefer using "ffmpeg" using the Front-end GUI
"winff".

sudo apt-get install winff

Once done, just open-up the UI -> Set output format, folder
                                                   -> Choose input file(s)
for batch processing
                                                   -> You may override the
default bit-rate by specifying the values OR you can edit the existing
preset output formats.
                                                   -> Typically, a bit-rate
of 6000kbps should be sufficient enough for a HD video.

Hi friends,

 I have a HTML form by which one can upload a file.
the form code is

<form action="my.py" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="file" name="upload" >
<input type="submit">
</form>

I read the contents of that uploaded file in "my.py" as
req.form['upload'].value for content and req.form['upload'].filename
for its name and i store the file in my hard disk. Now i expect the
same if the user uploads any zip file. Now i testing for zip file
uploading. But i couldn't move further in zip file operation.

When  i return the "req.form['upload'].value" form "my.py" for zip
file uploading, i got the following things

PK

LUG sure is helpful in firming up your nerves and in making you 100% man.

Long ago there was a person by name ....leave it.

In those days there were several flame wars and his only job was to
prove that he was smarter than the rest.

Such experiences sure made me a better human being.

I also used Chennai LUG for becoming a good corporate trainer. And it
is only because of Chennai LUG that I got some excellent friends and
contacts.

I think overall if you look at it in a balanced fashion Chennai LUG
has surely helped me more than it has hurt me.

AFAIK, in India, the banks require that your site should be owned by a

although I welcome the resolution of the problem and the formation of the new 
list, I also wish to state that it is a very sad state of affairs that on an 
Indian list, Indian language posts are banned. If some members had only 
followed the repeated requests of the majority of members, and if they had 
tagged their mails this necessity of banning and forming a separate list would 
not have arisen. I now I see that the person responsible for this sad state of 
affairs has been 'rewarded' by being made list admin of the new list - how a 
person who has shown total disregard for the viewpoints of others can be fit to 
be an admin of a list is something I cannot understand. I have serious 
objections to this and I request the LUG to reconsider this decision.

Its not a reward! Its 'work'. No one objected when he was first nominated
and no one else stepped forward. I think though Ma Sivakumar stepped forward
he later agreed to Amachu taking over. If there are irresolvable issues with
his moderating, then he can be replaced!!

In any case I think this is an issue that has to be discussed in the Tamil
list and not here!!! I hope better sense prevails!!

Saddening.

I remember him playing an instrumental roll in promoting FOSS in govt 
depts and
he is a very knowledgeable and upright man .

In the spirit of LUG, all  members  should do  whatever possible  to 
ring fence this good man.

It's because the new list admin will give freedom to you and me & to every
one to discuss what they want in the new list. He is someone who have the
interest & dedication to Tamil Computing more than anyone else on the list.

Please stop discussing this further and allow for some peace in the list.

Why do you feel that way ? Are you just in rant mode ? It is ok. Everyone has a 
sense of disillusionment at one point or the other. However, it would be good to 
remember a few things in moments like this:

a. The principles behind free software existed *looooong* before 'open source' 
became a buzz word and appealing to the corporate houses. Except for a few 
extremely dedicate individuals *most* free software developers had day time jobs 
in full blown /proprietary/ companies (eg: Sun, Novell, IBM ...etc). That did 
not stop them from doing what they loved in their free time and exchanging the 
fruits of their labor in a free manner. Think about this a bit. There was a time 
(just about 20 years back !) when even /suggesting/ something resembling open 
source within your company would only end up making you look like a fool. ...and 
I'm not even talking about some lowly developers ...a lot of who's-who of the 
FOSS world didn't even have the choice to work at a company which was at least 
in some manner open to FOSS.
    FOSS survived those times and there are companies now who at least work with 
the community (even if the motivation is personal gain).

b. The reason a company exists is because of money. There is *nothing* wrong 
with using FOSS as a "test bed for Corporate houses, a place for them to get the 
developers work for free, finally put a logo and then earn name, fame or 
money(anone one or all)...." In fact that is the way most successful FOSS 
companies work ! The point to remember is, even doing this, requires time, 
effort, dedication and most importantly an understanding of the sharing culture 
inherent in the community. Any company that does not get this, might be able to 
leach of the community for a while but will die in the long run. Look at Sun as 
an example of this. Companies can't just take and 'not' give back. It doesn't 
work that well in the long run. Companies like Red Hat have understood this.

c. If you think anyone /owes/ you something because you are part of the 
community, you need to re-examine why you are here in the first place. Every 
FOSS developer makes a choice to use/adopt and contribute to FOSS for /personal/ 
reasons. They contribute freely knowing fully well that their contributions 
might be just 'taken' by anyone (without even a thank you note) and that they'll 
get nothing in return. This is ok ! Think about this too a bit. Say you write an 
encryption library and release it under an open source license, now /anyone/, 
including Pakistan, China, North Korean, Al-Qeada have the 'freedom' to use your 
software for any purpose (freedom 0[1]). You should /understand/ the implication 
of this before saying that you believe in FOSS. You should come to the maturity 
to understand that FOSS developers don't care what you do with the software as 
long as you stick to the limited set of rules enforced by the copyright license. 
So if greedy companies are 'leaching' off the community and not following the 
'spirit' of FOSS, let them. If however, they are breaking the law by ignoring 
the conditions of the copyright, you can take them to court[2].

d. Finally, understand that *you* are the community. Each one of us makes it 
what it is. The leaders of the community as we know it today, faced a lot of 
problems, but they stuck by their principles, some working silently to improve 
the software in their free time while their efforts were being 'taken advantage' 
of by greedy people, others being extremely vocal and refusing to compromise 
even a bit - however, in the end they won and are winning ! Perceptions won't 
change overnight. Corporate greed will *never* die. /You/ as a person have to 
make the choice whether you want to continue believing in the principles of 
FOSS. It is nobody's responsibility (least of all corporate's) to facilitate the 
community, it is just a choice /you/ make.


Hope you give up your negativity, forget about greedy companies and return to 
being part of this FOSS community, which is *ours* to make it whatever we want 
to make it.

cheers,
- steve

not so - it is my hope that once things cool down, language with tagging will 
again be allowed here and that this list will be a model for the Indian

I have serious issues with a person who has demonstrated lack of tolerance for 
the opinions of others and who has used words like 'mob' and 'oppressive' 
about this list. As to the fact that 'no one objected' - no one was asked. Ma 
Sivakumar raised this issue in a closed group of 4-5 people.

why not here? both are ilugc lists are they not?

Friends.

Please read once again this page.
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2010-July/059063.html


They requested for a tamil list and got it.
and they stopped in posting in Tamil in this list.
Victor also stopped. :-)
Let us stop too.

my wife has a usb stick which she uses for taking printouts and backup. Since 
she has to go to a browsing centre for printouts, the stick needs to be 
readable by windows. The stick has virus on it - how does one reformat it to 
remove the virus and at the same time ensure that it is both writeable by

after formatting it should be readable/writable in linux.  But, for read
only in windows,

Why reformat? Delete all the viruses from GNU/Linux
find . -name ?*.exe? -exec rm -i {} +;

I am happy to share the responsibility to anyone coming forward to take it up. 
If any one is willing to do so Please share it in the ilugc.tamil list. 

Right now, Prof. Sriram, Ma Si & myself have the admin credentials to the 
list. I am labelled to the external world as Admin. Thats it. 

In fact, I had mentioned in a private conversation of interested people 
wanting a Tamil list for ILUGC, that I have had similar oppurtunity in the

Later I agreed on the request of Ma Si.

Since all USB sticks are FAT32 formatted, the above step formats it to FAT32
filesystem.

If you know which device your USB stick is, then fdisk line is not required,
he might
have mentioned to know about the disk/partition of the USB disk

It should have been

fdisk -l /dev/sd{X}

^^^^ what is that ? Could you please learn to quote correctly ? I see that you 
use Kmail. I am sure it is capable of automatically quoting when you hit 
reply/reply-all. It might even be possible to select some text and then hit 
reply/reply-all resulting in only the selected text being automatically quoted 
properly (that behavior at least exists in Thunderbird).

The way you seem to be doing it right now is, pressing reply/reply-all, then 
deleting all the quoted text, then copying a bit of text from the original mail, 
then pasting it into your reply, then adding // at the beginning, then adding // 
at the end ...and only then writing your reply ! Why ? Computers are good at 
automating tasks, let 'em do it for you (at least they'll do it correctly, ie: 
in a commonly accepted manner)

cheers,

Kmail supports it as well.  Haven't seen a desktop mail client that
doesn't support that behaviour.

Dear All,

What are the better ways to reply when some is in digest mode or subscribed to 
list but not receiving any mails and reading it through GMANE's RSS feeds as I 
do? 

Interested to know it.

I have been using "dia" for drawing all my Network Topologies etc.  I
believe it has stencils for what you need (I know it does have one for
SDL).
While it may not do any validation of your data model, it can
certainly help with the pure diagramming aspect.

You can also look into Kivio.

(a) Reply to the message as you would normally do.
(b) Edit all the irrelevant stuff including people's email ids ...
(c) Change subject line to "Re: ..........."
(d) put your say in an "interleaved" fashion.
(e) Send to the list

That is strange indeed, if you are a member you should be receiving
the messages depending on what you have chosen i.e. digest or
indvidual messages.
Also check your SPAM folder - a few legit messages land up there.

I  use  Knode to read GMANE'S archives (not RSS feed) in USENET (NNTP)
format.   A few mailing lists allow posting from USENET format.

Neither of the above can guarantee write protect.   Besides, the
registry hack has to be made in the Cyber Cafe machine - good luck.

I have a 128MB USB stick with a hardware write protect - that is the
only way I would be sure the viruses cannot write on to my device (I
have tested it).

As for removal of *all* traces of viruses:

"dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX"  where X is the device assigned to pen
drive by the kernel.

On most desktop systems with one HDD it would typically be sdb.

Otherwise "sudo /sbin/fdisk -l" and note the device name that maps to
the capacity of the pen drive.

Then create the vfat fs as others have suggested.

The above can be scripted if this is happening ever so often - just
make sure you are zapping the right device :)

Can Windows read/mount such a FS i.e. created on the device rather
than a partition on it?

Hello ....

If you want to just draw the Data Flow Diagram, then Umbrello. But just try
Argouml, it can have some other features in it.
Try this link also.

btw, do you remember that virus we had in Kolhapur which would copy the

Yes, absolutely.  It also wrote an autorun.inf file which would copy
the files on to a folder on my Linux desktop; thanks to Nautilus's
default settings on Ubuntu at that time.   Fortunately no harm done
but it really spooked me and ever since then I am extra careful with
USB sticks that have been attached to "promiscuous" desktops.

I have not encountered similar incident yet but I tell my sister to
zap her pen drive after she has taken it to local print services.
She is a lawyer and at times needs to make urgent copies of legal
docs.  Invariably they get infected.

Message-ID: <4C4D0D3C.9050007@lawgonindia.com>

Dear all

INVITATION TO ATTEND SEMINAR ON ?SOFTWARE PATENTS AND THE COMMONS?



Date ? September 2, 2010

Venue ? India International Center, New Delhi

Organised by Software Freedom Law Center, Knowledge Commons and the
Center for Internet and Society

Sponsored by Red Hat



As the digital economy grows, software has begun to govern and
regulate almost every aspect of our lives. Therefore, the question of
whether software should be granted patents that confer a 20 year
monopoly for the patent holder, is an extremely important question
from a socio-economic perspective.

In India, Section 3(k) of the Indian Patent Act says that, ?A
mathematical or business method or a computer programme per se or
algorithms are not patentable.? Given this context, the question of
whether software can be patented hinges on how the courts interpret
the term, ?per se? in Section 3(k).

Apart from this narrow legal question, there is also the broader
policy question of whether software should be patentable at all. While
experts like Ben Klemens argue that software is essentially a form of
mathematics, Bessen and Meurer show how the abstract nature of
software leads to software patents accounting for almost 38 percent of
all patent litigation in the US. Contrary to popular wisdom, Bessen
and Meurer's work shows that instead of promoting innovation (the
stated policy rationale for patents), software patents actually
decrease the welfare of software developers who have to bear the
unavoidable risk of infringing some of the more than 200,000 patents
that have been granted in the US. Building on Bessen and Meurer, Kevin
Emerson Collins argues that a tragedy of property results from the
inefficient, externality-generating overuse of the institution of
property itself.

This one day seminar, "Software Patents and the Commons" will look at
software patents from the viewpoint of the "Knowledge Commons," as
against the more commonly explored viewpoint of "Intellectual Property."

Some of the confirmed speakers at this event are:

?  Dr. Abhijit Sen
Member, Planning Commission

?  Prof. Eben Moglen
Professor of Law and Legal History at Columbia University
Founder, Director-Counsel and Chairman, Software Freedom Law Centre

?  Mr. T.C. James
Director, National Intellectual Property Organisation

We look forward to having you join us for this seminar. Kindly confirm
your participation to me by mail or call me on +91 9019992441.

It may not open up the file manager automagically but the device
should show up under "My Computer" and then one can click on the the
USB device and open file manager.  Depending on the desktop setting,
it may also show up in system tray.

my pen drive also got the virus - which I removed, and then found doze does 
not recognise the device - so I put the virus back and used it for a year or 
two until it died.

[OT] null security Jobs

Posted by: "null null" giimale@gmail.com ? holypsyche

Sun Jul?25,?2010 9:55?am (PDT)

Greetings from null!

We are proud to announce the launch of our latest project: n|u Jobs
n|u Jobs a.k.a null security jobs is an initiative by null - The open
security community. The aim of the project is to aid and boost
employment in the field of information security. The job posters
and seekers both can post/apply for jobs online and are not
charged anything for using the service.

Website: http://jobs.nullcon.net
Email: jobs_a t_null.co.in
Working for Peanuts? Working under Hari Sadu?
Logon to jobs.nullcon.net Today :-)

About null
null is an open community and a non-profit initiative with the aim of
bringing together the best minds in the information security field and
work on innovative solutions to counter current an emerging threats.
It is also a forum to freely discuss and responsibly disclose security
vulnerabilities via project Keeda.

Websites:
null Security community - http://null.co.cin
nullcon Security Conference - http://nullcon.net

What is null Keeda Project?
Keeda Project is a database of vulnerabilities reported by the
security community at large to null. The aim of Keeda project is to
inform the vendors and govt about any vulnerabilities found in the
wild and reported to us to enable the organizations respond to that
security threat quickly and fix it before crackers can steal
confidential data or infect their systems. Keeda is a free service and
we don't charge anything to the vendors. Although a Thank you note for
the person who reported the vulnerability and Keeda would encourage
more people to report vulnerabilities to us (eventually to you
privately) instead of disclosing them in public which can harm any
organization's business reputation.

Email: keeda_a t_null.co.in
Contact us if you have found any vulns (and also if the vendors are
not responding).

Hi all,

I am planning to get a Digital Cert and was going through the TCS site - http://www.tcs-ca.tcs.co.in/index.jsp

The problem is that they insist on WinXP and IE. Is there any place where I can complete this process using Firefox/Linux (Ubuntu)?

No. You can't use Firefox/Linux. ActiveX support  is needed in your browser

For private network you can always be your own CA (Cert Authority) and
issue any number of certs for systems as well as users.

Are you buying the dig. cert. for yourself (individual - for filing
tax returns company reports etc.) or a public facing system like a web
site?

For the latter you can get digital cert from
<http://cert.startcom.org> - caveat they may not be "known" to the
browsers or other apps and you may have to add them manually when the
client cites an exception.

To the best of my knowledge, the Indian tax authorities accept
personal  Dig. Certs. only from selected CAs.   These CAs are all
based on MS platform and it is no surprise that you need Windows on
the client site as well.

I had to use Windows to download my pesonal digital cert from MTNL.
Once downloaded I could export the digital cert and install it in
Firefox on my Linux desktop.

The first step to optimize anything is to understand the bottlenecks.
Have you done any analysis to figure out the bottlenecks?

Some things to look at:
* What is causing the db to slow? DB writes or reads?
* Enable slow query logging and check those queries.
* Have you created proper indexes?
* Can data be cached - See a related post on memcached.

memcached is a great idea though I have never used it.

If you cut over from php to perl, that will help provided you know perl.

perl is very fast compared to php.

Though my experience with php is limited and I personally prefer perl,
I think such a blanket statement could be misleading.  Also, with
stuff like APC cache, the application can be made to respond faster.
IMO, in this case as the OP says DB traffic becomes high, I doubt if
it is going to help.

Hi,

I have developed an php appliaction with mysql as background. This

If your PHP application could be refactored, try using HEAP/MEMORY
tables for MySQL database. Logic could be something like below:
   - Check for existence of MEMORY table on request and if exists,
     perform all SELECT from the table. If MEMORY table does not
     exist, perform the following:
       CREATE TABLE mem_table ENGINE=MEMORY AS
       SELECT fields FROM disktables WHERE conditions_as_apply;
     and then, SELECT fields FROM mem_table;
   - For all INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations, perform the same
     on the generated MEMORY table too. Based on the database
     design, there might be situations where you might re-generate
     the MEMORY table.

Better yet, create STORED procedures and TRIGGERS for updating
data to replicate/regenerate your MEMORY tables along with disk
tables. For fetching data, create a SQL FUNCTION to abstract the logic
of accessing contents from the MEMORY table.

Your PHP application can call the SQL FUNCTION to access data, while
updates can be done by calling STORED PROCEDURES.

Of course, the above methods call for a thorough refactoring of your
database
design and also your application - best done if your application is not too
big/or
database scalability is a big concern.

Other options are to check if your SELECT queries are expensive (full table
scans, inefficient indexes and so on). Try enabling general logging on your
database, analyse your queries and try running EXPLAIN SELECT on these
queries to get a clearer picture.

Deployment level optimizations might include fine-tuning your MySQL
configuration which helps quite a lot of times.

Using memcached/APC cache are other options (which I would not
recommend without fine tuning your Database and queries in the
first place).

Good luck!

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

CouchDB NoSQL family. Apache CouchDB is a document-oriented database
that can be queried and indexed in a MapReduce fashion using
JavaScript.

If you have plan to move the new NoSQL technology, Please take a look
at all the NoSQL Databases and evaluate one that matches your
requirement. http://nosql-database.org/

[guest@localhost ~]$ sudo grep -v "^#\|^$" /etc/squid/squid.conf | nl

[guest@localhost ~]$ sudo sed '/^#/d;/^$/d' /etc/squid/squid.conf | nl

note : This commands will remove the comment lines begin with # and empty lines. 

If you want to remove any comment line begins that begins with any other

Sorry I was too fast.

My stuff will not remove empty lines. But you don't need sudo.

This is pretty good as it is.

Well, yeah. I am looking for certs primarily to file IT returns. And later on use this for email communication and wherever I can use it. Looks like I will go with TCS as it is closest to my office and home. I will pay premium for the b****y brand - at least it will not go bankrupt anytime soon.

Thanks for all the suggestions though.

BTW, members of this list will be happy to know that RKnowsys while operating as a pure FOSS services vendor (since inception) has grown enough to make e-filing of IT returns mandatory :-) 

Experienced programmers are welcome to apply. We work with Liferay, Alfresco, Pentaho(planned), RoR, Groovy/Grails. As in FOSS communities, high end skills are required, valued and rewarded. We are currently *not* into php, python or regular CMS like Drupal, Joomla. 

We are too small to be absorbing/training freshers but if you are good and can show commits to any FOSS proj, we can consider you. We are very focused on FOSS and you will not survive if you are not passionate about this.

Hi,

        linux is a multi user, when you deleted a file and if you want
to recover it, reboot the machine to single
        user mode, and then do the following ( if you have not
rebooted the machine to single user mode,
	while the other user writing some file, it may be written to that place ).
          	grep -b 'search-text' /dev/partition > file.txt
                        	OR
        	grep -a -B[size before] -A[size after] 'text'
/dev/[your_partition] > file.txt
	- This method is ONLY useful if deleted file is text file.
	  If you are using ext2 file system, try out recover command..
	- this we can use only when we are using ext2 file system,

Is dataone the broadband connection?

I face a similar issue. But mine is more of a dns resolution issue.
Once it gets it, it seems fine.  But sometimes it just about never
gets it right :(

I also have a BSNL broadband connection. But I don't find any issue with the
speed. In fact it is faster now. Only issue I face is with the DNS. I have
changed the /etc/resolv.conf entry to point the opendns servers. After that
it is normal. I get a download speed of more than 50 KBps.

Changing in /etc/resolv.conf is a temporary fix, i guess. Most routers have
the option to configure the DNS IP's. Doing it there is a permanent
solution.

Also, I found Open-DNS servers blocking Social-Networking services some
times. So, i would suggest going for Google's Public DNS servers.

The first thing to do is to power off the machine, disconnect the hard
drive and then connect it to a different machine and follow the
procedures listed in the thread.

If you have deleted a file and if you are still using the file system,
the chances are that the inode will be allocated for a different file
and it will be completely overwritten.

Good Luck!

Beware of using Open DNS. Some of the edge caching systems relies on
routing you to a nearest server based on where the DNS query
originated from. And if you are using a Open DNS server, you might be
sent to a cache closer to the DNS server resulting in unwanted
latency.

Here is a fantastic blog post that a friend of mine wrote that
explains this with examples:

Thanks for Shaswat, Ajay and HOD and Staff for their support.

Requested for a Workshop on FOSS.
Let us hope to make it sooner.

Great point.  But note that the problem is not specific to OpenDNS
alone.  Any hosted DNS service has exactly the same problem.

Perhaps the best option is to run bind as a caching name server
for local users.  IIRC, the default config of every distro is to run
bind as a pure cache only name server.

However, OpenDNS/GoogleDNS/etc have some neat technology
deployed through UDP Anycast.  Good reading for any networking
enthusiast.  And in any case, these services are far better than
the DNS infrastructure provided by Indian ISPs.


But since the OP has problems with Skype disconnects, his issue
is not with DNS at all.  Skype super node IPs are 1) hard coded in
the binary, 2) updated on every connect, and 3) cached locally.
Skype works perfectly even when DNS is not configured in your box.

Perhaps OP should consider checking the physical DSL/telephone
cable or the issue could also be due to congestion in the BSNL network.

True, but the assumption is that the ISP has some clue not to use a
DNS server half way across the globe.

I am not sure. I run a ubuntu box and it does not have bind installed
by default.

For the technology wise, yes, but again, I assume that ISPs have
atleast a caching name server installed closer to you.

I meant the bind config after you "apt-get install bind9".  CentOS/etc
make it trivial "yum install caching-nameserver".

Fully agree on the importance of proximity to end users, and the
limitations of OpenDNS/etc as a consequence.

But other than proximity, ISP DNS has limited advantages.  Main
disadvantages are lack of correctness, reliability and security where
the OpenDNS/etc score high.  However, the privacy aspects of

Hi,
Anyone here know of cheap mobile phones that can be used with
Gammu/Gnokii to send text messages ?
There is a list available [1]. But either the phones listed there are
no more available in the indian market or it is erroneously included.
BTW, do they sell GSM modems at Ritchie street? Any experiences with
mobile phones/gsm modems to send messages are appreciated..

Thanks,
Harish

I think all low end Nokia mobiles with mini USB port will work.

All replies in this thread are brilliant.

I use OpenBSD's inbuilt caching DNS server and simply point the
nameserver to 127.0.0.1.

If it is Linux I use one of 4.2.2.2 or 8.8.8.8.

I could also point to the 192.168.1/24 address of my local OpenBSD box though.

I have been a big fan of BSNL and all sarkar stuff for a very long time.

And I bank on them for my biz. It has never let me down.

Nowadays BSNL experiences DNS problems, that is all.

No issues with speed or stability.  It is better than my friend's
connection in New Jersey. ;)

I mean the gear that they use is much better since my friend always
got an Internet disconnect when he received a phone call.

Whereas the private players don't have the cash to spend on good gear like BSNL.

> Hi Arulalan,

I will be glad to share my documents with all, but I don't have system with
me. I need to sit in office and then I need to modify and upload them.

I also have some sample script for function, array, passing argument, trap
etc. To understand these script u may need little explanation, else it may
be little bit difficult to understand for a fresher how the program flow is
working.

Better meet me, and I can help you out. I don't need any money to help you.

What you can do is that arrange a PC with Linux OS (prefer RHEL or CentOS)
and call your friends those who are interested to learn it. I am ready to
teach you.

This total syllabus will take 16 hours, so better to have class on holidays.
Maximum I will be free on saturday and sunday.

You can reach me on my mobile: 9962594372, before that be comfortable with
linux basic commands.

Hello everyone.

I am anirudh singh shekhawat (irc nick Acedip), a fedora ambassador
and foss community member from quite some time now. We have also
founded linux users group jaipur around a year ago which has made up
quite an active community in the city, organizing meetings and events
regularly. Anyway, I am in chennai for a six month internship at
paypal, and wanted to get in touch with the foss community here. Does
ilugc meet often, when is the next meet up? Looking forward to meeting
everyone.

wxCam is a webcam application for linux. It supports video recording
(in an avi uncompressed and Xvid format), snapshot taking, and some
special commands for philips webcams, so you can also use the program
for astronomy purposes. It supports both video4linux 1 and 2 drivers,
so it should work on a very large number of devices.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=VZcLeUyvaedS_HyDQNWcJn-qiT6i0wk_p2h4T@mail.gmail.com>

I'm considering setting up ssh keys to access my servers. If my
understanding is correct, it is strongly advised to use a passphrase (to
encrypt the private key, I think!) as otherwise anyone getting hold of the
private key file will have unfettered access to the servers!

But it is also suggested that ssh-agent (or keychain etc) is used to manage
passphrases - so that one does not have the trouble of keying in a long
passphrase everytime! I feel this defeats the very purpose of a passphrase!!
A person getting hold of the ssh-agent config (or whatever file that holds
the passphrase) file can just as easily access the servers!!

Am I missing something here??

thanks,
mano

Host and guest can ping each other.
On the guest I have a CherryPy app running at port 8080.
I am unable to access this web application from the host.

For this reason, ssh-agent will never save the passphrase in a config file.
You are forced to enter it manually whenever you start ssh-agent and add
keys.  Once the keys are added, you can then use ssh repeatedly without
passwords.

The main security problem with ssh-agent is that it creates a unix domain
socket for communication with ssh.  This file/socket is secured using standard
unix file permissions and hence root can access the ssh keys for any local user.

Suggest you read this article for a good understanding of ssh/ssh-agent
interaction:

Please check http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_hostonly for
a reference.

Please Check whether IP tables are enabled on your host.

You need to configure port forwarding. I haven't done this myself. But see
http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html for more details.

I think you missed the point here. Firstly, you're going a good job, but 
every mail you send has a section at the end that says "To install" and 
you give a command that is only relevant to debian based distributions, 
not for rpm based distributions.

So, what Rahul suggested was, instead of saying "To install", you could 
say "To install in Ubuntu / Debian" or remove that "To install" section 
altogether.

True, ssh-agent only avoids the need to type passphrases recently.
Also, If you want you can add a lifetime for the identify it holds.
ssh-agent runs as a user process and it does not store the passwords.

For the point about root having access, if you dont trust your admin
or if your admin is not trust worthy, you are doomed. It is not about
just reading the sockets, what if he replaces the ssh binary so that
he gets a copy of the password when you type it et al.

Subject: [Ilugc] India's $35 Tablet- The Everything Killer
Message-ID: <AANLkTinQAgDdeYgnv1e=zSmn+x-bMTBV_XubdP+wNOXT@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

On July 22 a $35 (or 1500 INR) hand-held Linux computing device was unveiled
by Shri Kapil Sibal, the Union Minister for Human Resource Development of
India. The goal of the project is to lower the price to around $20 in time
and eventually reaching the amazing price of $10.

In a tablet form-factor and using an unspecified variant of Linux (that some
have said might be Android), the cost should remain low while offering a
wide range of functionality. The Sakshat descendant is said to be capable of
supporting video conferencing, viewing a wide selection of video and image
files, word processing, de/compressing files, printing with CUPS, full
Internet browsing with Javascript and Flash, wireless communications, and
remote device management.

iptables enabled on guest.
I even did a 'sudo ucw allow 8080'.

Still nmap says 8080 on guest is closed.
PORT     STATE  SERVICE
8080/tcp closed http-proxy

On the host (Windows 7) I have configured the Windows firewall not to 
block port 8080.
PORT     STATE    SERVICE
8080/tcp filtered http-proxy

Google Chrome says: Error 102 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED): Unknown error.

If what the government says is true, then we have a winner. I really 
couldn't get to see any closer pictures other than Mr. Kapil posing with 
it - Reminded me of actresses and models posing for mobile phones and 
digital cameras. The tech specs are not revealed yet - I understand that 
it is a prototype and still under active development and they don't want 
to reveal so much information upfront - if that was the case, then why 
this marketing gig anyway?

On the other hand, we also have another 'indian' tablet brimming for 
release. NotionInk Adam[1] anyone?

Could you please post the ifconfig, the command you used to run the port
scan? Do you have separate anti-virus,firewall product on your vista 7 ? Try
disabling UAC.

What about trying bridged networking mode?

Yeah. Gammu does say Huawei E1550 is supported. But looks like there
are some trivial issues.[1]
Anyways out of curiousity have you used this before ? Any glitches
that i should be aware of before buying it ?
I'm solely going to use it to send some SMS alerts using Gammu/Gnokii.

hi,

the KG group of companies - http://group.kgisl.com/ have a open source 
department - one of their initiatives is here:
http://fossible.kgisl.com/ 

I happened to visit the group and find they have done extraordinary things 
using open source. For example there is PAC which does online processing 
storage and rendering of scans and xrays - they have implemented it in 
php/msyql and have several TB of data at the cost of about 5 lakhs whereas 
other hospitals have shelled out 1.2 crores for the same. College ERP, 
construction ERP and an enterprise wide ticket managing system tied to a 
zimbra server with things like right-click on a ticket to approve it, or right 
click on a person's name to send him an sms. The have used sms extensively - 
like staff can take attendence in class using their cellphones and sms the 
result to the server.

There is an over reliance on php - but we are working to change that. Also 
they are yet to open source their applications - but that too is going to 
change.

ps. stale jokes about the name will not be appreciated

You anticipated my next question :-) I leave my laptop in suspend mode when
the lid is closed and reboot maybe once a week. Without this feature, the

Now I am sending OneDayOneCmd via sms to all over the India using  Huawei
E1550 USB GSM modem by Gammu and as well as Gnokii.. .

Its working fine for me :-)

we need to edit /etc/gnokiirc and /etc/gammurc . Thats all.

My suggestion is use gnokii. Because gammu can send sms only upto 160
character.

But gnokii can send multi msg as our normal mobile. :-)

PS : While write script to send sms to multi numbers using gnokii, you need
to set some time delay. say for eg 3 to 4 seconds delay. otherwise it
collapse by sending and receiving msgs at the same time.

For sniffing data off USB bus you have to use usb sniffers.

For ethernet network interface use tcpdump.

If the USB data card is recognized in Linux as a network device then
tcpdump will work like this.

$ifconfig

Find out the data card ifce.

# tcpdump -i <ifacename>

Dear Friends,

After heated discussions (which was civil throughout), ilugc.tamil, an
younger sibling to ilugc was born on July 22, 2009 with the
announcement by Prof Sriram to the list.

Just an update to those members who are not part of the Tamil list.

1. There are 74 members in the Tamil list as of now.
2. 153 messages were sent to the list during the past one week (though
much of the traffic can be attributed to myself and Amachu, more than
20 members participated in discussions).

We hope to have more activities through the list and supplement
current efforts of ilugc in spreading FOSS in Chennai, Tamil Nadu and
other parts of world.

The younger sibling is fortunate to have the backing of a strong ilugc
built over 9 years with tireless efforts of volunteers.

Thanks.

Best regards,

Ma Sivakumar

wireshark - you can select the interface eth0 (NIC) and most likely
ppp0 (on your USB modem connection).

port scan; replace [ip] with host and guest ips.
nmap [ip] -p8080

Disabled UAC and still no luck.

Host is Windows 7 Professional (not Vista).
Nope. No luck with bridged network adapter, couldn't even ping the guest.

This shouldn't be so complicated!

I can't comment on this article, but some how we are in the land of
getting petrol out of trees and announcing cheap computer which turns out to
be pen drive.
I expect these news comes from people who are in the labs and they may say
big breakthrough in some technology so it is possible.
I have no intention of going through merits of this article.

Ok. How did you ping ?   Suggest you to check whether  you are pinging
through the right interface. what is the default network interface on
windows? Have you tried pinging the host from the guest?

Of the late, I don't think so, we need a  separate meet for PHP. If you
interested to spread the name and fame of the PHP, why cant you people {
MIT- CS + KLUG } plan a talk on PHP in every ilugc meet. I hope it would
make sense. We have only four Saturday in a month, out  of four, three was
already occupied for some other reasons.

First Saturday being the working day for most of the people, I don't think
so more people would turn up.


Thanks

please do not do this - an occasional talk on PHP in ilugc is ok - along with 
occasional talks on other languages. For regular talks, a separate forum is 
better. We have one for python.

Waiting for this one. It seems to be a dream tablet since it has just
about everything a computer/tablet needs. However, I think it is
launching in US first, then coming to India.

Wish they would release it here along with US!

However, I am optimistic about the $35 tablet from the gov. Great power
to Mr. Kapil Sibal and the students who will first be using the devices
:)

This is a valid concern. Can we consider monthly webinars for specific topics?

Even though they will not have the same effect as physical meetings,
webinars have the potential to reach more people (who can not attend
physical meetings).

As an added advantage presentations and talks will be available in
digital form for sharing and future reference.

We tried http://www.dimdim.com/ some time back, which was quite good
and free (no cost).

You need to set the service "on" so that it is started @ system boot.

I know the CLI way.

1. Install chkconfig  (apt-get or synaptic)
2. chkconfig lsassd on

Hi Yogesh,

I know grep and sed, about awk or gawk I can get some material to u...

gawk also provides programming support, so its not a small command, it has
lot of options. About RegEx, I don't have any idea, I have never used it.

introduction / Linux Installation at Dr. Dharmambal Govt. polytechnic for
Women, Tharamani (www.drdgpcw.org). About 40 students of Dip. in Comp. Tech.
attended the session.

I thank the dept. faculty/HOD for the opportunity.

but the power of prayer is undisputed. As everyone knows there is a huge 
controversy as to the expansion of 'PHP' - some say it is 'Pray Hard and 
Patch' and others vote for 'Patch Hurriedly and Pray'. But all PHP programmers 
are of the unamimous opinion that without deep and abiding faith in prayer, 
nothing can be accomplished. They only differ on when to start praying.

What you have is a java keystore. What you need is the certificate in
PEM format. Convert the keys using openssl. Here is a set of commands
that should help you.

Your question is not very clear. If you do not want folks to use any
open proxy, you can do

* Setup a transparent proxy to allow all traffic through your proxy server.
* Block all outgoing traffic other from your own servers.

Dear Sir,
    My question is people are misusing the proxy server. Let's say I 
have a proxy server ip address as 192.168.1.10 which run 3128 port. But 
people are using open proxy server with different port.
   
    Please go through this site.

Hi,

are of the unamimous opinion that without deep and abiding faith in prayer,
nothing can be accomplished. They only differ on when to start praying.

One of such php programmer writes as

"I really feel for all those python programmers looking for truth and beauty
in web site coding.  I know Python can be used as a server side scripting
language, but I don't think it's ever going to be as easy to use as PHP.  If
this were 1997 there might have been a chance, but the world has moved on. "

Dear Vellingiri,

Port redirection/transparent proxying is very hard to get right.

Port 3128 is for squid.

First  check whether squid is running.

$nc -v squidip 3128

If it connects it means that squid is running.

To to some other machine and type this.

$ nc -v netip 80

and see if it is connecting to the squid port 3128.

It means that port forwarding is working.

I have never learnt awk and I have done several shell scripting trainings. ;)

I think in today's world perl will do what awk can.

sed is great though.

Perl can do everything that a shell can and much more :-)
Better yet, Perl scripts are more portable than shell scripts across UNIX environments and *cough* Windows too.

chinese posting with or without tag is a no no in this list ;-) Could we have

I really feel for you that you are reduced to reading such rubbish. The post 
is by an asp.net 'developer' who is attracted to php/linux hosting because it 
is 5 times as cheap as doze hosting. Fellow can't even make up his mind 
whether doze is stable or not. And actually DasBlog which he is using is 
written in asp.net. I will pray for you that you upgrade your reading material

yes, I saw this solution in the web - I managed to shrink the partition in 
doze, but I think I did something silly also in there. My big mistake was not 
rebooting doze twice before installing fedora. Now fedora works fine, but doze 
won't boot. Need to re install/repair doze and then do the whole thing once 
more without the silly step I took.

Hi,

I ended up writing a really amazing perl script which belies what it
> can in its size.


A shorter (perhaps one-liner version) below:

# Save as slowtype.pl
use Time::HiRes qw(usleep);
$| = 1 and usleep(20000) and print for (split //, join("",<>));

Can be run as a filter ;-)
perl slowtype.pl /etc/passwd  OR
ps ax | perl slowtype.pl

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

Since when ? You can still download one for free
from the following link:
  http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads

But who cares ? There are so many options:
 - http://strawberryperl.com/
 - Cygwin + Perl
 - AT&T UWIN + Perl
 - Use the source luke ;-) [http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/perl-5.12.1.tar.gz]

Hi,

A better version as below (manages to type in random periods):

#!/usr/bin/env perl
# Save as randtype.pl
use Time::HiRes qw(usleep);
$| = 1 and usleep(rand()*150000) and print for (split //, join("",<>));

Run as below:
perl randtype.pl /etc/passwd OR
dmesg | perl randtype.pl

The one-liner version could be as below (run at the shell prompt):
dmesg | perl -MTime::HiRes -e '$| = 1 and Time::HiRes::usleep(rand()*150000)
and print for (split //, join("",<>));'

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

excellent article, I agree with 99% of what the author says. Except with parts 
of this:

"I didn't mean by this that Java programmers are dumb. I meant that Python 
programmers are smart. It's a lot of work to learn a new programming language. 
And people don't learn Python because it will get them a job; they learn it 
because they genuinely like to program and aren't satisfied with the languages 
they already know."

Thanks for sharing. Sometimes I see some posts which are openly against 
to one software company and particularly to its operating system. And 
they always spell the OS name or the company name wrong - I guess they 
think they're kind of cool by doing that. I always wonder, whats wrong 
with them - Mark puts it very well.

Awesome,  so the owner of Canonical and thus Ubuntu, talks some sense 
about how to behave in a open source community, how to treat others with 
respect and how tribalism and fanboism[sic] is stupid and all we can do 
is do finger pointing? Saying 'hey, you're not perfect either'. Such a 
childish behavior! Please treat the post for what it says and not for 
the history of the person who says it.

P.S. I'm not a huge fan of Mark Shuttleworth, and disagree with some of 
his decisions in managing Ubuntu community and Ubuntu OS itself. But 
that doesn't mean I have to hate that guy and call him 'Shattelwarth' or 
'ttlewurth' or whatever fancy name which will make me think that i'm cool.

this is wrong - totally wrong. As all of us well know 'code of conduct' is a 
fancy word for etiquette. And the open source world has laid *great* emphasis 
on etiquette always. And codes of etiquette have been there long before Mark 
Shuttleworth came on the scene. 

As for tribalism - who coined the word 'linux for human beings'? Those using 
other distros are animals? Anyway it is good thing he is against fanbhois - 
maybe this will evoke some response in the fanbhois of the distro that has the 
largest number of fanbhois going?

Sorry but that makes no sense.  If someone preaches something, it is
obvious to ask,  have you followed what you preach?  Why should we
ignore the history of the person saying it?

May be because (s)he has already done the mistake and know the consequences
and/or wrongness of it? I don't know.

I suppose the above have been coined by you.

I could not find the above oblique references to Shuttleworth in
Asokan's citings; neither did Asokan make any such reference.

IMO, the discussion centers around "respect for others"  in this
particular case women.

How about the person start with an apology in that case for the mistakes
done?  Otherwise the preaching looks shallow and makes the person a
hypocrite.

True. I apologize unreservedly to all offended by my poor choice of

That is too generic and talks only about choice of language but not
about intentions or actions.   An apology if sincere should be specific,
direct and connected to the advice you give out to others.  Not within a
comment.   One is a position of arrogance and righteousness and the
other is humility.    It is tribalism when you talk about masturbation
and ejaculation in a free software keynote or attack a competition
distribution falsely for being proprietary or make claims about a better
security record without providing details or when you send a open invite
to employees from the competing vendors to join your company?  If you
did mistakes in the past, you start with an apology, talk about what you
learned from it and let others learn from it.

doesn't look like an apology to me - non specific, one year after the event and 
tucked in as a comment deep in his blog. I can do that also:

I hereby unreservedly apologise to all luggies offended by my poor choice of 
language on all occasions.

alright, I wanted this discussion to stick to the 'tribalism' and not on 
the merits & demerits of Mark Shuttleworth. I don't have any reasons or 
facts to defend him. I don't want to. Lets just hope that similar blog 
post is written by someone we respect in the industry, so that at least 
then we'll discuss whats written in it (hopefully in a php website, if 
it was in asp.net we brand him as an idiot)

Do people hate Ubuntu and Shuttleworth or what! anyways, I'm going back 
to coding.

I have noticed Redhat working close with Microsoft. 

Ubuntu even.

Why?  It is just redundant for every distro to say it is for human
beings.

This has nothing to do with my point.   Every Linux distribution is for
human beings.  There is no need to state it explicitly.

Actually, Ubuntu's website doesn't even say that its Linux!

Only when you drill deep into its documentation, you'll find this quote 
"Ubuntu is an entirely open source operating system built around the 
/Linux/ kernel."
For this, if I'm visiting its home page (ubuntu.com), I need to make 4 
clicks. (home page -> support -> documentation -> Ubuntu <version> -> 
About Ubuntu). Soon, in the near distant future, this will only be a 
part of the license formality just like what Apple does with its Mac OSX.

"Linux for human beings" is a marketing strategy used by Ubuntu till the 
recent past, I don't see their websites boasting about that now.

<ahem>
However, openSUSE is claiming that their distro is "Linux for open 
minds", how dare they think that I'm a closed minded person? This is 
atrocious. Bad openSUSE, bad Novell, bad people, #fail. my distro is 
better than theirs. #win
</ahem>

I tried this. It was unnoticeable. I saved maybe 40 ms every request
over Google's DNS so it was completely unnoticeable. Both Google's DNS
and a caching name server (on the same LAN) were huge improvements over
Airtel's stuff but the difference between the two was usually
unnoticeable.

With Airtel's DNS I would frequently be looking at time-outs quite
frequently and when I wasn't the results were slow.

now I am in the soup - this guy had bought a laptop in dubai, hp pavillion 
entertainment with windows 7 premium. Fedora cannot access the internet - 
recognises the ethernet card, but the 'activate' button on the network 
configuration is greyed out. Windows refuses to boot and he says he was not 
given a cd/dvd along with the manual. Any ideas?

solved this at least - the old problem, if ethernet card is controlled by 
network manager then one cannot activate it - now all that is left is to get 
sound to work and also wireless, bluetooth and windows 7.

service network restart ??

chkconfig network on

few services aren't started by default in fedora.

off late, that might be the case. We received a HP desktop couple of days back
with Windows, they didn't give the medium. 

Instead they expect people to back it up from the system.

More than the speed advantage, the point of discussion was
that Google/public DNS will confuse CDN, while ISP DNS
would not cause issues.  A caching name server will work
best for both speed and CDN.

For wireless, please check whether it is broadcom adapter, broadcom driver
is available in rpmfusion nonfree repositories (correct me if i am wrong).
Enable rpmfusion free/non-free repos and run 'yum install broadcom-wl'

I'd just like to add, please read the comments to the post too. Which give you a 
good balanced idea. This post was prompted by the calling out on more than one 
occasion of Ubuntu's lack of contribution:

Most recently for GNOME:
http://gregdekspeaks.wordpress.com/2010/07/29/red-hat-16-canonical-1/

Prior to that for the kernel:
http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/lpc_2008_keynote.html

...and also on various mailing lists/forums etc.

IMHO, having to defend oneself by words rather than work in meritocracy based 
FOSS is ...ahem ...sad. At the end of day this whole issue is just that someone 
pointed out that the emperor has not clothes on and the emperor says - 'hey, 
look, I thought I had them on but if I don't you should really be pointing it out'.


cheers,
- steve

PS: Branding people who are just pointing to facts, as 'The Gregs' and engaging 
in this:

...apparently doesn't qualify as tribalism ?

Try the following for wireless.

To check, if the wireless interface is supported by Fedora,

lspci -n | grep 280 (note the device id)

and to look for device module

cat /lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.pcimap | grep <device id here>

All these systems have a recovery partition to bring the PC back to
factory fresh condition. Why not try that and then install Fedora with
the double reboot that you missed?
