To all,
First of all, let me begin by saying thanks to all of you who have
contributed to Saucy. Since Trusty is a LTS version, it is even more
important to perfectionize our manual.
I have made a new worksheet for Trusty Tahr, see [1]. For convenience
sake, I have removed all the hidden columns with data of previous
versions. You will find the data of previous versions in the worksheet
"Backup Trusty".
For those of you who are already eager to start writing/editing :),
please add your name to the chapters/sections you want to work on. Even
though TT is in its early stages, you can start keeping an eye on the
subject you have chosen to write/edit. May I remind you that there are
long and short sections. If your time is limited, just pick a short
section. All contributions are more than welcome. Let's make this
version of our manual a success together.
You can download TT from [2] and install it in Virtual Box. At this
moment it is almost a copy of SS, but when you update regularly you will
see the changes.
Thanks in advance for your contribution,
Hannie

@ Baskar - a nice comprehensive list suggested by you.

Additionally, I would suggest that put such postings in ILUG-Chennai
wiki or blog with searchable tags.   IMO, it would be in one central
place rather than searching the mailing list archives.

Message-ID: <CAK2rq7wi7EUo4tSdC5OgWJrWSbz9FHMbw2iZ72rn3HQ8antHSw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I installed Mint 15 from live USB on my friend's PC which has UEFI
boot. Now after installation, earlier installed Windows 7 started but
did not boot and went to recovery mode. i installed ubuntu's
boot-repair on live-usb and tried auto-repair but no luck there. Tried
some fixes on MBR to GPT but all efforts in vain so far.


http://paste.ubuntu.com/6351911/

http://paste.ubuntu.com/6351893/

He needs a dual-boot. First preference is to recover installed Windows
and Mint 15. Does not mind wiping everything off the hard disk.

I did google for hours but all this MBR, GPT, ESP, etc just go over my
head. I am no developer just an average desktop user.

P.S. If it is not too much to ask for, we stay at Nanganallur and
would appreciate any volunteers to help in installation at my friend's
place. I know we had a installation fest hence taking the liberty for
requesting for physical presence. (Even I have registered as volunteer
but have no experience in UEFI). Please mail me if you wish to help.

I had some problem with UEFI boot. Check bios  boot order if first
boot is uefi device then try to change it to plain hard disk. It may
work.

I another case installing from cd went well while usb boot gave similar problem.

Hi Anand Radhakrishnan,

I had similar issue with Ubuntu & window 7.Without plunging in usb
drive, System not booting up to select the option.
using live window 7 dvd, i repaired the window os, it fixed the MBR.
After running the window i installed EasyBCD in window.
Then i used EasyBCD software to set a back up of booting loader.
using virtual cd drive i mount the iso image of Ubuntu in window os
.As it got the installer exe file option to run window itself to set
the installation.
After that it was working fine.when ever i want remove the linux boot
option i use easy EasyBCD software to restore the boot loader.


You can try EasyBCD software to fix the boot loader option.
if you haven't tried  Universal USB Installer (
http://www.pendrivelinux.com) software it very good tool for usb
installation work.

Arun S

Interesting post to ubuntu-quality list from a 9th standard student.

It is a good sign that young students start to contribute.

A very good evening and Happy Diwali (festival of lights) to all from
Bhopal, India! Myself Shubham Rao, 14 years, student of 9th grade. I
am fairly new to QA but not to Ubuntu. I've been running it from the
11.10 release. My experience with Ubuntu has been great, and I've been
recommending to all my friends, always advocating its (many fabulous)
advantages over its (slight) disadvantages.

There's not much adoption of Ubuntu here in my city (the only people
running it are considered too techie) and I want to change this from
the next release itself. I want Ubuntu so popular that it should speak
for itself and there should be no need of advocating it. I want trusty
to be a super dooper hit among people and I know that to make it
successful, the only people who can do this are the people who assure
Quality!!

Okay now enough of Visionary talk, here what I've done:
Installed trusty-desktop-amd64.iso on VM

Ready to go!!

Hope we have a great testing time

On a lighter note, coincidently, Trusty Tahr gonna get launched on my
birth date!!! so much is at stake for me.

Thank You

With Regards,
Shubham Rao

But then the use of ps+kill and pkill are discouraged by purists as
for example, the ping and fping processes would return the same
results.

It would have been more helpful if you have started off stating the
difference between the HPC and HA cluster.

I have deployed many experimental and production HA clusters in the
past. You have not mentioned that without fencing, HA cluster is a
disaster.

Of course I could not complete an HPC clustering as I have to switch
jobs at that time and they did not have resources for the same.

I think you should have mentioned clearly that clustering is not for
the faint hearted.

and it requires some kind of shared storage like SAN or iSCSI.

Kindly request you to make things make more clear henceforth. At the least

Have you tried tools like os-prober (Arch Linux) which detect existing
operating systems.  Not sure if there is one for Mint.

When I moved from MBR to GPT,  I had to start afresh wiping out the whole
HDD and recreating and mounting the boot partition after Ubuntu's existing
install broke.

Thanks all for your suggestions. Looks like the windows partitions
have *SFS* as file system type (from ubuntu boot-repair info)...unsure
whether it was already the case....

Will try repair from Windows recovery disk else last resort is to wipe
hard disk and start all over again with win + mint installation.

Installation on UEFI seems to be a real PITA although secure boot seem
to have advantages...

Message-ID: <CAND2794KjpFQTLyFwnKGk-OFOPF7Y7kxZapmHk33GuO3E8BASQ@mail.gmail.com>

Recently, one of my friend, who is practising GNU/Linux, struggled a lot
to do some activities in only of my production servers.

Reason: No expereince in production servers.

Though he is a RHCE guy, he has all the theory knowledge and very less
practical knowledge
on working with email servers, firewall etc.

I suggested him to buy a VPS and practise all the stuff he has learnt.

https://www.digitalocean.com gives 5$/month VPS.
It seems so cheap and will give good experience for beginners.

There may be even cheap VPS providers.

http://crazydomains.in provides .in domain for 99 Rs/year.

My friend bought a domain and VPS.
Started to install the servers he studied.
Hope this will be a good start of exploration

I suggest all the GNU/Linux Administrators to buy a VPS for regular practise.
Believe me, it will give you tons of experience and learning.

'dict' is a python built-in. Not a good idea to use it to name your variable.
So something like my_dict = {88:'c2process',89:'riskmgmt
>

print my_dict[int(i[1])] will convert the string in the 2nd column of
the csv file to an integer and use it as a key, since your dictionary
uses integers as keys.

Hi Hari,
Can you check if this is what you needed? As per your requirement this is
what I have understood.
ifile  = open('/tmp/acess_Nov5_1.csv', "rb")
reader = csv.reader(ifile)
print 'Key--->value'
for i in reader:
      if i:
          print '%s--->%s'%(i[1],dict[int(i[1])])
c2process
riskmgmt
portal

Although, the "School of Hard Knocks" is the best way to learn
practical things, there are ways to train/coach yourself on
maintaining servers on the WAN.

Before jumping into managing servers on the WAN, it would behoove to
study best practices and join a few 'global' mailing lists on the
different distros and read the postings therein.   I learnt a lot this
way w/o any CapEx (even @ $5/month) except for my time :)

Secondly, with hardware virtualization a lot can be learnt by creating
virtual networks + VMs.  With backtrack you can do pen testing.

I would recommend this as the third stage, when the person is
comfortable with rummaging through log files (or reports from tools)
i.e. mental preparedness.  On the WAN, the types of attacks a system
is subjected to, can be overwhelming even to a seasoned admin.

With regard to

https://egovstandards.gov.in/system/files/PublicReviewDocument/Framework_on_OSS_Ver0.8.pdf


I notice the following:

(please add any other points soon or submit it directly by 8th to
egov.standards at nic.in )
________________________

Adoption of free software is a great idea, but the document has
serious shortcomings and lacks vision.
We explain these below.

There is nothing specific about free software in the document.
There are serious differences between the idea and implementation of
free software and open source
which are particularly relevant in the context of this document. Do see
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
for relevant details.

The only concern for OSS seems to be 'reduced cost'. As far as "free
software" is concerned, the people drafting the document seem to
interpret "free" as "gratis" instead of "free as in freedom" (p.39).
Nothing is said about security models, openness of information,
knowledge commons and transparency of processes - that can be the
outcome of free software adoption. If the adoption process stops at
open source software that is not free software then all of the
aforesaid benefits cannot be ensured in practice. This is also
important in the context of mass surveillance by Government agencies
(Indian Govt agencies function in more draconian ways than NSA). The
concepts underlying the framework need to be stated more clearly and
the goals improved severely.

Why does the document say so little about funding free software projects?

The document propagates FUD of proprietary software developers in
regard to free software licenses like GNU-GPL. It should be required
that all software developed by the Government must be under GNU-GPL-3
and above or Affero-GNU-GPL in special cases. GNU-GPL-3+ remains the
best license for almost all use cases including commercial ones. For
more on licenses see
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.html and
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html .  Non copy-left
licenses should not be tolerated. They eventually amount to infringing
on people's fundamental rights.

Subject: [Ilugc] Outreach Program for Women: Get involved in open source
Message-ID: <CAND2796iEeveu=KGoCS5bw9kr0ocY4SV3AVV4ohDW_st_dXs3w@mail.gmail.com>

Source: http://www.muktware.com/2013/11/outreach-program-women-get-involved-open-source/

Lisa Nguyen, Xenia Ragiadakou, Elena Ufimtseva, Laura Vasilescu and
Tulin Izer worked with The Linux Foundation this summer and availed
focused internship opportunities with free software organisations as
part of the FOSS Outreach Program for Women (OPW).

Part of the first group of OPW interns, these women got a chance to
work with kernel developers at Intel, Oracle, and Citrix between June
and September 2013.

Projects handled by these interns included the x86 boot process and
vNUMA topolgy. Apart from $5,000 stipends, they benefitted from a $500
travel scholarship to attend and speak at LinuxCon in New Orleans or
Edinburgh.

?It?s not often that I?d get to say, ?I volunteered at LinuxCon North
America, spoke at LinuxCon North America, and met Linus Torvalds in
three days!? Nguyen told Linux.com. She focused on Xen block drivers
with Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk at Oracle during her internship.

?I?m not scared touching kernel code anymore,? said Izer, who worked
with Peter P. Waskiewicz Jr. at Intel on parallelizing the x86 boot
process. ?This was my first contribution to an open source project and
I?m really proud of it. I intend to keep doing this for a long time.?

If these women inspire you to add ?Linux kernel hacker? to your resume
too, you can enroll yourself in the next round of Linux kernel
internships. The application deadline is November 11, 2013 and the
internship dates are December 10, 2013 to March 10, 2014.

The applicants would collaborate with mentors from the participating
organisations to make a contribution relevant to the project they are
applying for during the application process. The accepted participants
will work remotely, while being guided by their mentor, and receive
$5,000 stipend.

Subject: [Ilugc] Happy Birthday Fedora - 10 Years
Message-ID: <CAND2796vopqo8F2vxLvvEy4PYw+wPiXVRFTvKMm7RAG_Ehdm+g@mail.gmail.com>

Released on 6 Nov 2003, the first version of Fedora called Fedora Core
1 which was based on Red Hat Linux 9 and had Linux kernel 2.4.19  and
Gnome 2.4 and KDE 3.1 as the available desktop environments.

Fedora is one of the most respected GnuLinux distributions around.
It?s been used by leading Linux developers including the father of
Linux, Linus Torvalds himself.

There are so many different elements that sets Fedora apart from the
rest of the GnuLinux distributions ? one of the most notable features
of Fedora is innovation. Fedora is a cutting edge operating system
which keeps it users at the edge by offering latest packages.

Second beauty of Fedora is heavy contribution to upstream ? unlike
many other GnuLinux projects which make changes downstream to benefit
their own users, Fedora developers prefer working upstream so that
everyone benefits from their work including products like Ubuntu.

Third beauty of Fedora is ? promotion of Free and Open Source
software. Once again, unlike many distributions endorsing non-free
software, Fedora offers only those applications which are available
under FLOSS licenses.

Fedora was born when Red Hat decided to change its development and
business model to strike a balance between fast paced innovation and
offering a stable platform for enterprise customers. At the same time
Red Hat also needed a model where they can sustain without adding any
non-free sauce to their offering and remain fully free software.

Fedora GNU/Linux Distribution is celebrating its 11th birthday today.

Though I have used it very little, might for few days in my 10 years
of life with GNU/Linux,
I installed it for many users.

I started from slackware, refered by Chandrashekar.
Then, moved to Debian, refered by Raman.

Then, explored Mandriva, OpenSuse, ArchLinux and Ubuntu.

All the distros just a wrappers for the applications we use.
Whatever the distro, we use only the Desktop Environments like KDE, Gnome etc,
and applications like browsers, email clients, terminal etc.

What Fedora provides is the nice similar structure of RedHat.

I suggest to try Fedora for all the people, who study for RHCE exam.
Most of the RHCE people I know are ignorant of the similirities of the
linux distros.
They steal the RedHat distro and they install it in their laptops and computers.
They do not want to come out of RedHat.

Poor people.
They dont enjoy the fancy and luxary stuff that a GNU/Linux distro provides.
RedHat is good for servers. Not for laptops.

To learn the GNU/Linux, we have to use it in our daily use.
We have to use to hear music, to watch videos, to connect with wifi,
to play games, to install tons of application.

These RHCE guys can not do anything that a normal computer user can do
with their RedHat computers.

Here, the Fedora gives them a surprise.
They can experience the same structure of RedHat and all the bells and
whistles of a modern GNU/Linux distro.

With tons of new applications added to the Fedora repositories, they
can enjoy a new life and experience with a GNU/Linux system.

Please refer about Fedora to all the RedHat beginners and let them
enjoy their GNU/Linux distros, by using it for all thieir activities.

IMO, it is good for one to go through a few distros.  Learn the
pros/cons and different view points of administering them.

IMO, it is a 'herd mentality' mindset.   A few months back a client
wanted a LAMP server with CentOS hosted at a Tier 1 data center.   The
tech support had no clue about CentOS!   He kept telling me that he
had the RHEL DVD and the install was not a problem.  I spent a better
part of the afternoon educating him as to why that would be bad for my
client.

Even worse, there are training institutes that still use Redhat 9 to
train their candidates for RHCE!

> Poor people.

Indeed.

Which one are you referring to?

> RedHat is good for servers. Not for laptops.

Maybe not for laptops but there are desktops.  At times a newer kernel
+ firmware does the trick for newer laptops.   Also, there are a few
commercial desktop apps that come as an "appliance" with RHEL desktop.

I have come across a few who use Windows desktop for their daily chores :(

There are third party repos for RHEL/CentOS like  EPEL, ELREPO ... the
sum of which is supports a much larger package base.

With respect to learning for RHCE, I would say go with CentOS - it is
re-branded RHEL feature for feature bug for bug.  Plus with 3rd party
repos you can get a reasonable desktop experience as well.

Topic:
Let us translate Octave GUI in Tamil



Description:

GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for
numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical solution
of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing other numerical
experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data
visualization and manipulation. Octave is normally used through its
interactive command line interface, but it can also be used to write
non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite similar to Matlab so
that most programs are easily portable.

Let us translate it GUI into Tamil.
Come with laptops, or you can write on paper.

Subject: [Ilugc] Slackware 14 Released
Message-ID: <CAND27961=a__EgqfR7oBbS_OfKFcBs5wsYozM+mSZ7o14rxgiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Source: http://www.slackware.com/announce/14.0.php

 Yes, it is that time again!  After well over a year of planning,
development, and testing, the Slackware Linux Project is proud to
announce the latest stable release of the longest running distribution
of the Linux operating system, Slackware version 14.0!

    We are sure you'll enjoy the many improvements.  We've done our best
to bring the latest technology to Slackware while still maintaining the
stability and security that you have come to expect.  Slackware is well
known for its simplicity and the fact that we try to bring software to
you in the condition that the authors intended.

    Slackware 14.0 brings many updates and enhancements, among which
you'll find two of the most advanced desktop environments available
today: Xfce 4.10.0, a fast and lightweight but visually appealing and
easy to use desktop environment, and KDE 4.8.5, a recent stable release
of the 4.8.x series of the award-winning KDE desktop environment.
These desktops utilize udev, udisks, and udisks2, and many of the
specifications from freedesktop.org which allow the system administrator
to grant use of various hardware devices according to users' group
membership so that they will be able to use items such as USB flash
sticks, USB cameras that appear like USB storage, portable hard drives,
CD and DVD media, MP3 players, and more, all without requiring sudo, the
mount or umount command.  Just plug and play.  Slackware's desktop
should be suitable for any level of Linux experience.


Downloading Slackware 14.0:
---------------------------

    The full version of Slackware Linux 14.0 is available for download
from the central Slackware FTP site hosted by our friends at osuosl.org:

   ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-14.0/

If the sites are busy, see the list of official mirror sites here:

I am one who have used all versions of Fedora, right from Fedora-1 to
Fedora-19 and really enjoyed using it, and my collections of Fedora distro

Hi Mozillians:

Firefox turns 9 on Saturday, November 9. (Fun fact. That?s called a golden
birthday.) That?s 9 years of innovation, security and a better Web.

We wanted to celebrate all of our accomplishments in the last 9 years, and
yesterday, we wrote a blog post about it here:
https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/11/07/happy-ninth-birthday-firefox/

But sometimes things happen in the world and we must set aside celebrations
for simpler things.

So let?s celebrate, but do it in a Mozilla way. Doing good is part of our
code, right? So if you wish Firefox a happy birthday on your social
channels, encourage people to help those impacted by Typhoon Haiyan;
suggest they help raise awareness that the Red Cross is accepting donations
here: http://www.redcross.org/news/article/Typhoon-Haiyan-Disaster-Alert

Thank you for an amazing 9 years. We can?t wait to see what the future
holds. Meanwhile, we?ll help make the future better for those who need a
little assistance right now.

I feel that if people put in a lot of effort, it may definitely help!!
But, the task does not end in writing petitions.. It just starts with that!!
The bigger move is to convince and train the personnel, especially the core
management, in the respective open source arena..

I have seen many people telling that they are used to that XP Screen /
Office Features and it will be difficult to change!!


They easily forget that they went through vast transitions from
Handwritten  --- > MS DOS - Windows 98 - Windows 2000 - Windows XP (and
moving on........>>).

Thus, Resistance to Change and Reluctance to  learn new are the major
issues.

But, Change is the only thing that does not change!!
Once we get over these things, (provided good help comes out even for silly
questions) Everyone will be prepared to Change!

Today, My beloved Tamil author Mr.N Chokkan, asked a question in twitter.

He asks that

People ask for download link when a new Book/Movie/Audio is released.

99.99% tweets are regarding download links. Nobody asks for a link to buy
them.

Will people ask for a how to steal rice, when they need to buy it?


This questions raised a lot of thoughts and shared them here.

Will you by a Digital Product that allows you to share and remix?

I think you meant "Will you *buy *a Digital Product...?"
There are few things to ponder upon....

When it comes to a Book, in paper format, costs come into account. For
instance, publishing cost, Paper Cost, etc.

But, except for the First Copy of a Digital Product, others do not have
such price!!


Further, if I buy a music CD, say, I cannot prevent my fellow room mates
from hearing the song when I am hearing...

Much of Music heard today has become popular just because, it was SHARED
FREE!!! (By Some media like Television..)

But, again, if a Digital Product allows me to re mix, there are
possibilities of horrible mixes..
No one would like to hear a spoiled Remix of Ilayaraja / Rahman...
Hence, Re mix must not affect the original notion!!

It depends on the lic. under which the digital product is released.

Remix -- IANAL, howwer I believe one needs to be careful about the
lic. from the original content creator(s).
For instance - CC and GNU document lic. stipulate conditions for
remixing the original content.

A book / music does not come out without an author. Their pay is an
implicit requirement.

Only Broadcasters Pay!!!
Not everyone who is listening!!!

Even if you point out that I am paying some amount as Cable Fee, in case of
TV,  that is for all sevices in collection.
But, take the alternate media, FM Radio. Millions of people hear them while
walking, travelling, bathing, etc. But, No one Pays (Directly)!!
They just hear and walk.......

Thus, they hear the music since it is being shared and proceed on their own
way!!
Remember, they do not reproduce it !! (Except for Humming)

And, even those who download it, hear it!!! They are not reproducing it!

And in most cases their royalty is based on the number of copies of
the books/CDs that are *sold*.

Yes, you do pay (with your time) when you have to listen to (watch)
the commercials, whether you buy the advertised item or not +  whether
you add any value to your time is a separate issue.

> Even if you point out that I am paying some amount as Cable Fee, in case of

and royalty fees paid by the cable operator comes from the monthly fee
you pay.  No pay they cut your service.

> But, take the alternate media, FM Radio. Millions of people hear them while

And they are subjected to listening/watching commercials.  Please see above.

There is *no* free breakfast/lunch/dinner.  You may not be paying
directly but some one is.

This is not an issue.

>

As long as they are not violating any lic. or royalty terms.  Heck if
the lic. terms allows reproducing / redistribution they would not be
in violation of terms.

My interpretation of the point that Shrini raises in the OP - people
expect 'downloads' for free (as in beer).

Message-ID: <CAK2rq7wh+b47C__yL6BFttBcEoOwyCDvjrDYOmKLUVcfUYtEvw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Many of us are already familiar with Linux Mint project in form of
their OS and can vouch for its ease of use. Not sure how many of you
are aware of their foray into hardware. Linux Mint and Compulab have
collaboratively created MintBox2 - a compact and powerful headless PC
with Mint Mate natively installed.

http://www.fit-pc.com/web/products/mintbox/
http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2441

It is bit pricey (600$) but I still went ahead and bough this rig
through my friend who returned from US recently. My impressions are so
far are very impressive. It looks compact (just the size of a router),
sturdy , lot of ports, and seems to absorb the heat well. I have it
connected to TV temporarily as I am yet to procure a HD monitor. The
set up went like a breeze, at last understood why Mint have an OEM ISO
image. :-)

I also had a look at Mac Mini which offers a similar configuration but
in case of Mint Box, i feel that it is pretty much open in terms of
upgradation / addition of hardware components such as SSD.  Also, 5%
of the revenue is shared with Mint team.

If you're looking to replace an old beast in your home or planning for
new desktop for your office, this may well fit your needs.

Extract from http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2472 by Clem:

Andrew Gregory, Mike Saunders and Ben Everard left Linux Format to
dedicate themselves to the creation of a new magazine. Linux Voice
plans to give 50% of its profits back to the community and release its
articles under Creative Commons 9 months after their publication. You
can help with the crowd-funding at
http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/linux-voice. If this happens and it
creates a source of CC licensed articles of the same quality as the
ones we enjoy from Linux Format,  we?ll consider developing a
newsstand application for Linux Mint.


Hoping that the campaign succeeds....

 Hi All,

Iam migrating my SVN Server from one centos machine to another.

OldServer Version:
Collabnet SubversionEdge *Release: 3.0.0*
CentOS release 6.2 (Final)

can we have upgraded version of collabnet and centos in the new machine.

Ex:latest of Collabnet SubversionEdge and centos 6.3

All my repos were present in the below location
*/opt/csvn/data/repositories*

*For taking dump from old sever*
*In old server*
*/opt/csvn/data/repositories/*

*svnadmin dump /opt/csvn/data/repositories/abc > dumpfile1*
*svnadmin dump /opt/csvn/data/repositories/xyz > dumpfile2*

 *In new server*
*To load it in the new server*

*svnadmin load /pathname/abc < dumpfile1*
*svnadmin load /pathname/xyz < dumpfile2*

*do i need to take dump one by one.*
*is there any other way to do all the repos as one.*

*if i follow the above steps,do i migrate all the repos from old server to
new server without any loss of revisions,tags,branches and history.*

*or do i need to do any more steps here.*

Microsoft(NASDAQ:MSFT) <http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/default.aspx> has 
revealed the results of a startling study of the banking sector in India 
today.?  Conducted by Ascentius Consulting, the study has revealed that 
some 34,115 Indian PSU bank branches are at risk due to their reliance 
on Windows XP. Windows XP will no longer be supported by Microsoft 
beginning April 08, 2014 
<http://www.microsoft.com/india/msindia/pressreleases/banks-in-india-could-be-at-major-risk-with-only-100-workings-days-left-for-windows-xp-end-of-support/512/>, 
but the study shows that the penetration of Windows XP is still high 
at 40???70% in the banking sector.

Amongst the greatest risks facing banks that maintain their Windows XP 
installations, despite the end of support, are their ability to respond 
to customers and manage waiting times.? Besides, there are several IT 
risks that will require extensive effort to manage. In the light of 
these, CERT-IN has also come out with an advisory recommending immediate 
migration.

We have been advising our customers to move off Windows XP for a long 
time now. There are a significant number of PCs out there that still 
need to be moved as per a plan. The move to a modern OS like Windows 8.1 
will not only alleviate the risks for users and businesses but will also 
open up opportunities posed by modern technology, like the cloud, for 
them, said Amrish Goyal, General Manager, Windows Business Group, 
Microsoft Corporation (India) Pvt. Ltd. 
<http://www.varindia.com/Krrish-3-Game-comes-exclusive-on-Windows-Platform.htm>

According to the most recent Security Intelligence Report by Microsoft, 
Windows XP users are six times more likely to be infected than users of 
modern operating systems like Windows 8.1, despite encountering the same 
amount of threats. Windows XP users are also twenty-one times more 
vulnerable.

I think this is the RIGHT TIME to make people migrate....
Not again to Windows but, to Linux!!

I have seen many people commenting that they prefer to stay with XP. That
is the most comfortable OS for them..
But, once they taste the flavour, they may show interest!!

We may highlight the need for migration to Linux at this moment...
If we demonstrate people that Linux is FREE (I mean, Free of Cost) and that
it can easily be managed, this can be done!!

Both the management as well as the working level are to be convinced in
this regard!!

 Hello Suresh,

My book, *Energizing Education through Open Source: Using Open Source
Software to Enhance Learning, *is now available.  I self-published with
Lulu Publishing.  It is currently available from their online store:

http://www.lulu.com/shop/christopher-whittum-med/energize-education-through-open-source-using-open-source-software-to-enhance-learning/paperback/product-21294170.html

It will soon be available through such vendors as Amazon.com and Barnes &
Noble, both in print and as an ebook.  To be honest, the title is a bit of
a misnomer as the book also covers open source hardware, such as Raspberry
Pi.

Thank you for your interest in this very worthwhile project.  My goal is to
create an awareness of the many valuable open source products that are
available.

Yours,


Chris Whittum

I think that you want to customise the Page setup in Libre Office (as in MS
Office).
If that  is the case, Go to Format --> Page.

You will find the options over there.

If you are looking for some other application, please write the name of the
application.

Dear all ,

Some happy news for all of us .


The School curriculum steering commitee of  Kerala Govt's SCERT(State
Council Educational Research and Training)  decided  3 majors points in our
interest yesterday

1. SCERT is improving Book printing infrastructure by shifting from Adobe
's softwares to FOSS based XeTeX and free licesned fonts.

2. They will shift from ASCII to Unicode . This will also help in universal
access for differentially abled via technologies like Text to Speech even
in Malayalam Language .

3. The books will be licensed under  CC-BY-SA .

Official Order is still pending. But I am posting this since it is already
in media reports.

Read a repotrt in TOI
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Now-free-software-to-set-school-textbooks-in-Kerala/articleshow/25781341.cms

The Change will be applicable to all newly publishing books from now
Starting from Malayalam Text books in 5, 7, and 11th standards

Myself, Hrishikesh K.B and a team from Swathanthra Malayalam Computing (
http://smc.org) are working closely with SCERT from last to help  them in
initiating this change process.

Thanks to Dr. P.K Thilak, Research Officer  SCERT , Director SCERT, and
Biju Prabhakar IAS (Director of Public Instruction, Govt of Kerala )  for
initiating this Change.

Using people's money the syllabus is framed, the content is created
and the books are printed. So by default the content has to be open
and distributable (at least distribution without modifying should be
possible with proper attribution).

Hi All,

My share trader's website was revamped a week ago. They started using
silverlight completely. Previously it was working fine with Linux but
now it became a problem. I found a solution that uses wine and windows
version of silverlight to the solve the problem. The technical stuff
got solved - that is not a problem.

Is there any way to stop people / companies from using these
proprietary technologies? Those companies get caught and in turn users
are forced to use them.

Thanks,

Poor choice in design/tools.  It is the limitation of the web
developer and the people who commission the developer to do the work.
 How do you control the zillions of shops out there?

Most of the web developers have forgotten or are not aware of Tim Berner Lee.

Last week I went through the process of US visa application. The
entire process was flawless from signing up to filling up online forms
and submitting it for an interview [1].  BTW,  all of the pages
served, had .aspx extension.  I was not forced to use any specific
incarnate of IE and it did not complain about my desktop OS (Debian).
The owner of the site envisioned multiple browser, various desktop OS
and ensured that the web site development team did not put any
constraint on their "customers" to do business.

This concept is lost on many businesses who contract their application
development w/o much thought as to who is their customer.

[1] it was able to handle erroneous input without backend errors.

True. Cross browser and cross platfrom testing is necessary to cover
all customers.

Hi Gowtham,


     We at Techartus have done internships as part of our recruitment
process all the time. I guess most companies do - you just have to ask them.


      Send me your profile if you are interested. We can talk about it.

I guess the best bet would be to start taking on more responsibilities on
linux servers in your workplace/outside as a passion. After a while, you
will be comfortable with the real life issues and tricks on linux, you can
actually look for a linux job.

btw, you have 'hijacked' Gowtham's thread - since you have a new question
to ask, you should have started with a clean mail instead of replying to
Gowtham's mail. Please take care of this in the future.

I have done IS audit of couple of co-operative banks.

Even the mention of Linux scares them for some of the core banking
applications run only on windows.

Before migrating to even a newer windows version, the vendosr has to
do a hell of a lot of testing.

The core banking applications are fairly well tested.

and many are two-tier applications i.e. client server.

Some provide web interface as a part of netbanking.

But not all will bite the bullet.

Mind you that to my knowledge, none of the core banking apps have been
tested with a linux client.

To summarise, it may take banks about 5-8 years to migrate if ever
they decide to.

And bankers are by far the most conservative business people.

my two paise worth.

	Ramanathapuram
Message-ID: <CACtiFJa2jZenaE3a+N5CwZKAi-L_g-gpDhibX3pShwry7XseOw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Myself conducted a three days FOSS workshop in Syed Ammal Engineering
College, Ramanathapuram (http://www.syedengg.ac.in) from 10/11/2013 to
12/11/2013.

The college management decided to train all technical staff and teaching
faculties on GNU/Linux platform.

On the first day, the session was conducted for Technical staffs of CSE/IT
departments.  An internal FOSS Repository server was setup using CentOS and
configured for Fedora-19 remote installation (the whole setup process was
done by the System Administrator following the instructions, almost quick
and faster).

The second day, an introductory session on using Fedora-19 was conducted
for CSE/IT/Civil/MBA/S&H Department faculties.  The faculty members
installed Fedora-19 using remote installation method and configured YUM
repository and after that everyone got busy with searching and installing
software through YUMEX/Apper and kept working on them.

On the last day, the same introductory session on using Fedora-19 was given
for Physics/Mechanical/EEE/ECE departments and they also practiced the same
as above.

The following were some of the FOSS tools which was introduced to them
during the workshop.

1. Scilab
2. GNU PSPP
3. LibreOffice
4. CodeBlocks
5. NetBeans
6. FreeCAD
7. BRLCAD
8. DraftSight (Similar to AutoCAD, though not a FOSS alternative)
9. ArgoUML
10. QUCS

I noticed a lot of enthusiasm among the Technical staff and Teaching
faculties during the workshop and the System Administrator told me that, he
would be implementing GNU/Linux and FOSS tools wereever possible in all
departments.

The college management encourages everyone to use GNU/Linux and FOSS
alternatives for the academic needs.

I would like to thank the following persons for organzing the workshop.

Dr. P. Marimuthu - Principal
Mr. N. Karchikeyan - HOD / CSE
Mr. Sivakumar - System Administrator

Dear Shrini,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts and let us give some opportunities for
these freshers to learn from real world experience.

My company is going to implement Fedora-20 (after its final release on
December 10th 2013) based FOSS Lab setup in 300+ Engineering colleges
across Tamilnadu in between January 2014 - February 2014.  I am in need of
atleast 20+ volunteers to complete the work during the above said period.
 I am preferring freshers with RHCE certification with no prior experience
(that's why I am writing this mail in ILUGC).

If freshers are willing to join in this initiative, they are almost
welcome.  Free training and Good remuneration will be paid to them.

Interested volunteers can mail me offlist for any additional details.

Please don't hijack the thread - even though your reply may be related
but it does not come under the same context I feel. Please write a new

Sigh! I reckon we should also have a tag for [Etiquette Sermon] that
accounts for most of the discussions here. I would be happy if my
biggest learning from subscribing to this group is *not* just mailing
list etiquette gyan on top-posting and such pedantic niceties.

Lol :). I don't like to say stop top post and such things. But I feel
hijacking a thread is going be a problem. When someone goes through

:-) Glad that you took it in right spirit. You would know what I meant
if you go through threads in archive and see that we miss no
opportunity to advise folks on etiquette but really dont answer their
queries. Newbies would take it in right spirit when we provide answers
first then advice else may only get intimidated. I am pure desktop
user but going through threads i understood how I can lead a plain
text life without *bold* and _italics_.

I really hope at least in next decade we will leave plain text legacy
behind us. ;-) It will be a good riddance?

Is there a specific reason for using pyfacebook? It is over 3 years old.
I would suggest you use pythonforfacebook @
https://github.com/pythonforfacebook/facebook-sdk

Facebook integration for an app is easy. BUT you should read the
architecture documentation of the official Facebook API @
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/. There are a series of steps which is
quite clearly explained. The oauth2 part is the only part a beginner might
find difficult.

This is make the public to aware about opensource free softwares and
also will create a good name to our group in public.
Last week I dicussed with srinivasan sir and we need money for these

Thanks siva karthikeyan, prakash prasad  for ur new ideas also we need
volunters to make it all happen , because conducting workshops need a team
to make it good to students mostly  schools runs on saturdays so we can
take workshops on saturdays too..
sure we can involve college students in this for better enforcement of our
group with young bees. this will also help them to develop their knowlegde
i have many college juniors contacts i will join them to with our  ideas...
thanks for ur support, lets also see for new ideas..



regards
naresh kumar

Any recommendations for Javascript charting libraries for forming
interactive charts? My main requirements are ease of customization
(colours, axes, labels) etc.

Something like highcharts.js but free.

Thanks,
GR

If you want complete control then go for d3.js. Bit of  a learning curve
but well worth it.

I would like to add a brief points here -

1. Are we not looking out for the objective that students should not only get and insight but also develop code. A weekly class out of their syllabus would just not be enough. We need to have proper projects also.

2. Its mandatory that we should have pratical session 

3. We should encourage students to develop new concepts where we can pool in

4. The biggest issue I feel is that apart from syllabus how much time and effort they can give. The students otherwise would just attend and loose knowledge in couple of weeks.

5. We should have a setup that where students can do development and all facilities should be provided.

6. Placements if possible should be given

There a lot of things that comes in my mind but how to state that - but primary thing is that its for them something out of syllabus, so they will take least interest for which later they will run to gain knowledge.

As such the programe should make a student a graduate in IT then? I feel our efforts meets requirement to a greater extent otherwise it would not much be effective.

Regards,
Prakash

promotion should include workshops and useful education.

It should not have textbook answers to questions like

what are the freedoms?

who made linux?

what is linux ? et al.

we have enough of theory that takes us no where. + somebody can easily find
the linux theories on net.

Try and bring good educators who can , say for example, take a class on
latex beamer to make a presentation.

Using Gimp to make flyers . and so on.

Not high level , kernel stuff. Just make people know which tool to use,
how to use kind of tutorials.

How long it takes you to get the error?
What is the video size?

Try increasing the timeout values to 600 or more.

MicroSoft Licesing and Budget Trouble for the Schools

The MicroSoft started their pinch on TN Schools,

The "Regional Partners" and the "MS Inside Sales Executive" call the
schools, one by one, and forcing them to buy MS licese for OS and Office
applications, a Minimum of Rs. 6 lakhs.
Already the schools are not giving sufficient Salary for the Staff, if this
expenses are added , then the situvation will be pathetic.

If i am correct, as per TN Govt School Syllabus, the schools should have MS
Win XP [ or Win 7 ] home edition license for 10 computers along with MS
office Home/ Student Edition. approximately 1 lakh,

where as many schools have more than 40 computers , so the budget is around
4 lakhs.

When one school member replied as "Here after,we will not use MS products,
so you will not touble us ?" then MS men replied "This is for the already
used software "?!!!" Also he added " How will you teach without MS products
?????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!".

As per the current TN Syllabus , for 10th Std, There is no computer science.
for 12th Std( only for Computer Sc. Group,)   StarOffice and C++ required.
[ Turbo C is needed, "gcc" is not practised / not accepted ]
In 11th Std, Computer Sc. Group , Windows XP is needed.


What is the Solution ?
# Format Everything and Go for any GNU/Linux [ i prefere Mint ]
# Use any "Turbo C" like complier / or train in gcc

Is it necesary to for the "Already Used MS" products ?

OR ANY OTHER SOLUTION ?

Go through the apache access and error logs and correlate the logs
with the time stamp when this occurs.  Hopefully, the logs will tell
you what is going wrong.

Thanks for the ideas we will try to practical oriented workshops that
will make them to use linux and first they understand linux is a
operating system if they are aware then we can enter coding,  then  it
would  be better we will try to teach how to use linux in the way of
workshops and some free gifts will also make them intrested in
linux.without knowing the usage we cant take them inside codings so
We will try to get dates from schools and try to make awareness of
free software later we will take it inside , this will be better I
think friends .

If you can help in organizing for a meeting with few School management
authorities, I can help in solving the problem to the maximum extent.

Hello everyone,

Good news! conf.kde.in is back with a blast in 2014 and is going to
run from 21st to 23rd February at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of
Information and Communication Technology in Gandhinagar.

While delegate registration is yet to be announced, the important part
- the CFP is open http://conf.kde.in/cfp.html

Who should you give a talk?
* KDE contributors wanting to share knowledge/experience
* People who have participated in GSoC, SoK, OPW or similar, to talk
about how their project experience was
* People who have submitted a couple of patches
   -- You are special! Share experience with other students who will
be attending, motivate them to do the same! If you found KDE amazing,
giving a talk will be the next amazing experience. (I gave a KDE talk
with just few months of being in KDE, and it was *amazing*)

As always, if you have any questions, feel free to ask! Remember,
there will always be something you can share with others :)

Cheers,

Using Linux may solve the issue. Did you try it? Another better option
is not to use Windows (and MS products) and Flash.

Can any publisher take the content, print and sell?

If they do so, will they give royalty to author?

Can they change the license of the printed book to - all rights reserved -

IMNAL - but if commercial usage is allowed then anyone can sell the content.

> If they do so, will they give royalty to author?

I don't think so, unless such a clause is stipulated in the CC lic. text.

> Can they change the license of the printed book to - all rights reserved -
> some thing else?

The share alike would have to be acknowledged otherwise the publisher
would be violating the original lic.

It is best to consult a good IP lawyer;  they understand the nuance of
the lic. language and interpret them from a legal stand point.

<personal experience>
I got a contract to become a solution partner with a company.  The
company sent the template.  I did not see anything insidious in the
content but my lawyer pointed out sections which could be used against
me in case of litigation.  She proposed amendments that were equitable
to both parties. The company's solicitor firm refused to amend.   I
did not sign up.

Yes. Of course it is necessary to acknowledge the original source and
distribute the part of the content under the same license.
Modifications should be under same CC-by-SA license.
Applies to all versions of the license.

Other parts of the book can be under a different license.

It is up to the publisher.

No. That would be violation of CC-SA and the matter can be taken to court.

We are happy to announce the next issue of the Linux Audio Conference
(LAC), May 1-4, 2014 @ ZKM | Institute for Music and Acoustics, in
Karlsruhe, Germnany.

  http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2014/

The Linux Audio Conference is an international conference that brings
together musicians, sound artists, software developers and researchers,
working with Linux as an open, stable, professional platform for audio
and media research and music production. LAC includes paper sessions,
workshops, and a diverse program of electronic music.

*Call for Papers, Workshops, Music and Installations*

We invite submissions of papers addressing all areas of audio processing
and media creation based on Linux. Papers can focus on technical,
artistic and scientific issues and should target developers or users. In
our call for music, we are looking for works that have been produced or
composed entirely/mostly using Linux.

The online submission of papers, workshops, music and installations is
now open at http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2014/participation

The Deadline for all submissions is January 27th, 2014 (23:59 HAST).

You are invited to register for participation on our conference website.
There you will find up-to-date instructions, as well as important
information about dates, travel, lodging, and so on.

This year's conference is hosted by the ZKM | Institute for Music und
Acoustics (IMA). The IMA is a forum for international discourse and
exchange and combines artistic work with research and development in the
context of electroacoustic music. By holding concerts, symposia and
festivals on a regular basis it brings together composers, musicians,
musicologists, music software developers and listeners interested in
contemporary music. Artists in Residence and software developers work on
their productions in studios at the institute. With digital sound
synthesis, algorithmic composition, live-electronics up to radio plays,
interactive sound installations and audiovisual productions their
creations cover a broad range of what digital technology can inspire the
musical fantasy to.

The ZKM is proud to be the place of the LAC for the fifth time after
having initiated the conference in 2003.

  http://www.zkm.de/musik

We look forward to seeing you in Karlsruhe in May!

Sincerely,
The LAC 2014 Organizing Team

Hi,

October 2013 stats for Tamil Wikipedia is out. We have crossed many
milestones in one jump coinciding with our Tenth Anniversary Celebrations!

* 1017 Total contributors . We have crossed the 1000 milestone after
Malayalam Wikipedia. Next in line is Hindi Wikipedia with 988 total
contributors.

* 118 active editors who edit 5 times a month. Highest in ten years and the
first time we crossed 100.

* 27 new editors joined this month. This is the second highest enrollment
in ten years after the 2010 June state wide essay contest time.

* 25 very active editors who edit 100 times a month. Highest in ten years.

* We went from 1 to  2 contributors for every one million Tamil speaking
population now.

* Registered 8.5m million page views. That is 2,83,000 per day. Highest in
ten years.

We hope to sustain this activity through various initiatives.

Thanks,

Ravi

here the question is about firefox, not windows or linux. Pls do not
mistake.


in my case, chrome and ie plays flash perfectly. its a pain to see the
firefox blink and crash with flash. While i trust firefox for many things,
this has made a black mark on the usage of firefox. any workarounds? pl. do
share.

Firefox uses the flash player plugin installed in the system for
non-IE browsers. Chrome (and perhaps Chromium as well) has its own
bundled version of Flash player (not necessarily the latest and
greatest, but tested and tweaked for Chrome). Since flash player is
proprietary software, there could be bugs in it which can be fixed
only by Adobe. Whenever flash crashes my browser, I make it a point to
disable flash on the site the crash happened and then load the flash
plugin on demand. This workaround has enabled me to use a lot of sites
that crashed the browser or caused it to hang. If you want better
answers or solution to your problem, I think it would be better to
contact Adobe via support forums.

P.S. Avoid top posting emails to the list and instead use interleaved,
trimmed posting. If you are wondering what I am talking about, kindly
read the mailing list guidelines -
http://ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines/ once before sending your next

Message-ID: <CABD5kLf-GKLRezuMmOS+N0sig_+yeGa+A=aSyFkzPg2f=h2vdw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Google Apps come with impressive features such as mail, documents,
spreadsheets - that make an entire office available on the cloud.

Is it worth upgrading to a paid membership @Rs.150 per user per month for a
100 user office? I am not aware of the other alternatives available that
are equally good or even better. Hence, posting this question here.

Any pointers with costs involved appreciated.


Thanks

I think we should try to push our respective employers to order for a

I would like to take a moment to thank all those who helped to make
this happen. Thank you Naveen and Kiran Ravikumar for sharing your
shoulders. Thanks to jury for sending their valuable time in reviewing
images. Also thanks to Pavithra, Arun Ganesh and Manoranjan for been

Duh... Where did you find Centos 6.6?

Even 6.5 is not out yet. RHEL 6.5 is out though.

Please do a

Thanks for the link.   I have also searched (magento + mod_security)
but I have not found any conclusive solution with the exception of
turning mod_security OFF.   mod_security has whitelisting wherein all
legit URI strings blocked by it need to be in but one has to sieve
through the mod_sec logs correlate the id and put them in the
whitlelist.conf file.

 Dear all,

We are launching a new celebration as announced in August, around Open
Educational Resources and Free Educational Software called Education
Freedom Day [1] which will be celebrated on January 18th, 2014
(Saturday). The registration just opened and follow our other events
process with a wiki page creation [2] and then registration [3]!

The date has been chosen as mid school year in order to somewhat make
an update on any project an education institution has been involved
with, and look at what to deploy the next school year. There are
nowadays hundreds of resources which we will try to list (a few of
them at least) in our wiki [4] which goes from specific tuition to
complete solutions depending on what your focus is. Some involve
software, some don't (except for the materials to follow). We hope
that you will be able to gather as many educators/teachers/professors
as possible and make them discover OER communities and the immense
possibilities that goes together with them.

EFD support questions will be handled on the efd mailing list[5] or
efd IRC channel #efday @ Freenode.

Thanks a lot and happy EFD!

Dish TV Receiver would have HDMI Female port which would be sending out
signals, like wise your laptop which has a HDMI female port would be
sending our signals.  What do you intend to do ?  May be every one is

Hi,

We'll be traveling across India to promote diaspora* and community
owned infrastructure. Let us know if you can help us in any way.

The time of hoping big corporates would take care of our freedoms and
privacy is over, it is time to build communication infrastructures
ourselves.

riseup.net and autistici.org has started it already. poddery.com
something we started in this direction. But we need to do more.

There is a role to be played by every one, techies like me can provide
the technical know-how, but non-techies like journalists have even a
bigger role to play if we want to see this adopted mainstream.

So we need people to help us reach these ideas to common people in
easy to understand and local languages, we need good designers who can
make striking posters and animations. Limit is only our imagination.

More details and getting involved https://www.loomio.org/groups/2759

Cheers
Praveen

I've a funny problem in vi/vim. The colour mark up shows up in some files
and does not in some others. The colour used is normal body colour through
out. Changing colour schemes changes the text colour but still mark up does
not.

Any pointers on how to solve this?

Like I said, I know the ;colo <name> command and have tried it.
Nevertheless, my problem is different. Let me explain what all I've tried.

a) Edit a file already existing. Mark in colours comes up well.
b) Open a new file for edit and mark up does not come up at all as we edit.
c) Open a recently created file and the same thing happens.
d) On any of these new files, colorscheme works in changing the colour but
all text appears in the same colour.

My surmise:
a) All characters marked as delimiters for mark up colours has somehow been
cleared. Where does vi maintain the list of delimiters?
