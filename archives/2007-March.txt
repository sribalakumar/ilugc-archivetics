And tired ;-). It's a rather simple issue getting blown out of
proportion - just use what works. We all love our mother tongues, and we
use it where it's appropriate, and don't where it's not practical to do
so. I'm sure everyone of us wants to help the user at the end of the
day. Though I think typing a technical query in my mother tongue is more
trouble than it's worth, but if the user took the trouble to type it in
Tamil, perhaps he has his own reasons.

        This is a point. I don't think I can ask, or answer, a
 question in my mother tongue. I mean, what is the hindi of file?
 directory? configuration file? script? program? how do I say init
 script in Hindi? or tamil?

        I don't think I can say that the bind daemon when started from
 an init script takes up 100% of the CPU for several minutes, and then
 crashes.  If someone said that to me in :shudh" hindi, I probably
 would have no clue as to what they were talking about.

language of a list/channel or the like is decided by the admins - or  
the people who created it. This is usualy mentioned in the list  
rules. If there is sufficient demand for a new language, a new list  
gets created. This also governs international lists - like postgresql  
or python, for all one knows, the non-english speakers may be the  
majority, but they have to take the trouble to learn english. I have  
been trying to put together a hacker dictionary in various Indian  
languages and my experience shows that our languages are never going  
to catch up with the new terminology. At the most what we do is  
combine english and the local language. And I have noticed this kind  
of combination is there in popular local language publications when  
dealing with computers/software. I have also seen this in local  
language versions of manuals - for example the manual that comes with  
the Tata Sky package. We may not like the idea, but it is impossible  
in todays world to write/learn to write good code without a good  
command of english.

Subject: [Ilugc] Monthly reminder: mailing list guidelines
Message-ID: <341165.7722.qm@web50213.mail.yahoo.com>

This is a monthly reminder on the mail posting
guidelines:

1. Use a proper subject line.

2. Do not troll in the mailing list

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll

3. Use [OT] for off-topic, non-technical discussions.
But, don't misuse this to start flame wars or to troll
in the mailing list.

4. Do not top-post:

Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting

Example of a top-post:

   Because it messes up the order in which 
   people normally read text.
   > > Why is top-posting 
   > > such a bad thing?
   Top-posting.
   > > What is the most 
   > > annoying thing in e-mail?

Always use interleaved posting. Trim the post you are
replying to and interleave your replies so that each
part of the reply is under the quoted part that you
are replying to. Further please leave a gap of one
line between the matter you are quoting and your
reply.

   what is your name?
   regards
   xyz

trimmed and replied as:

    >what is your name?

    my name is ilugc

and not as:

   >what is your name?
   >regards
   >xyz
   my name is ilugc.

5. Do not over-quote:

Example of an over-quote:

>>> On Friday you said
>>>  blah blah blah
>> On Saturday you said
>>  foo foo foo
> On Sunday you said
>  foobar

6. Do not post HTML messages

7. Do not recycle messages

8. Do not send attachments

9. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal
disclaimers. If your company uses disclaimers, don't
use your company ID for the mailing list.

10. Do not reply to a digest. (If you are in digest
mode and want to reply to a post use ILUGC Gmane blog
interface.

Link:
http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

11. Search for answers for your questions/problems in
google.com or any other search engine before posting
your query to the mailing list.

If any of the above are not clear to you, Please read
the detailed list guidelines:

Link:
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

12. Do not post messages in all capital letters. Mails
in CAPS is considered rude and is similar to shouting
during a conversation.

13. If you or your company is into GNU/Linux
migration, or you want help into GNU/Linux migration,
check here:
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/?title=GNU_Linux_migration

14. If you are looking for GNU/Linux distro CDs please
check here:
http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/?title=CDs_for_Grab

15. Following these guidelines could be helpful
http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/

16. Don't send season's greetings or birthday invites
to the group. Its not mailing list etiquette.

We must use the above guidelines to maintain better
readability, proper archives, efficient bandwidth
usage, etc.

Yes, I meant the binary nvidia drivers.
You can either install them from the restricted repository in ubuntu,
or download  the latest from nvidia.com and do a  manual installation.

Check out :
http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Latest_Nvidia_Edgy

   i also don`t get what kind of configure do you want to tell.... as in
> Debian, i configured /etc/X11/XF4Config by replacing "nv" with "nvidia"


Yes, that should be sufficient, though these days , you have a utility in
the driver package from
nvidia that does it for you.

  i tried xine,totem.


Try running xine-check - it helps in debugging choppy frame rates.

browse certain sites of mine. how can i check  whether my site is
blocked by my gateway which is located at 10.1.1.10

Dear luggies

   The preparations for the event is going well. A curtain-raiser
about the event was published in the education supplement of the
hindu on 26 feb 07.

   I request ILUGC members to volunteer for the stall of their choice
on 3rd Mar 2007. I wish atleast 25-30 volunteers from our side will
turn up.

What you need to do is server hardening, limit access to the server, choosing 
right web applications, applying security updates in time, et. al. and not an 
antivirus.

If you are on bsnl broadband a lot of their adsl IP pools are blocked by
wordpress / typepad type blog sites because of huge amounts of bots /
spam / "search engine optimizer" google spammers etc.

BSNL is an ISP that you should only use if you dont want to reach
anywhere useful .. their mailservers are widely blocked as well.

if you are using dynamic IP keep rebooting the modem until you get a  
clean IP, and then dont switch off

Limited use strategy

BSNL has only a limited range of dynamic IPs - and blocks on dynamic IP
space is often by the /24 (255 IPs around your IP) and higher levels.

Easier to get off bsnl.

this was in ooty where bsnl was (and I think, still is) the sole ISP.  
I am using bsnl here in chennai, so far havent found any sites  
blocked - could be I am lucky.

If the gw is at 10.1.1.10, then the gw is in your pvt network (and under
your control) - unless the ISP is distributing dynamic ips in the
10.0.0.0network to its customers!

Honestly, I do not understand the question!

yes but that 10.1.1.10 is the LAN interface of the bsnl router - the wan
interface IP - 59.something i guess - is what the outside world will
see, or will block

I think he is not looking for a photo to video conversion tool. AFAICT
he is asking for a tool to create a PhotoCD which is a proprietary
format invented by Kodak.

ImageMagick has good conversion tool.
e.g
convert -dealy 200 *.jpg video.mpg

will convert all pictures with jpg extension into mpg stream with 2
seconds delay [note: delay is in 1/100 of sec].
For more info look at man convert and man ImageMagick

Come on don't you know that you are not supposed to send these stupid mails.

This is a group for discussions on linux, open source, FOSS and stuffs like

i get the same. What had happened was that the remote server did not  
have X11. As it shouldnt. So when the program asked for an X11  
library, I assumed that I would have to install X11 also in order to  
get the library wanted. And a search for x11 did not reveal any  
libxt6. Anyway, someone told me to just install that library, which I  
did. It then went on the demand a few more libraries and the,  
mercifully, stopped asking. Just shows that often an approach to a  
solution is coloured by the context in which the problem arises.  
Context here being appalled at the waste of effort installing X in a  
remote server.

Some apps require just a subset of the X libraries rather than a
fullblown X install.

        Sending this to a large number of strangers, as you do, is
 likely to end up with you having to throw away all your data and
 start again -- what good is every single day of the year filled with
 several hundred people you do not know?

        Sure, I can help you fill every day of the year with rando
 people's names. How many do you want? 10 perday? 100? 1000? a couple
 of lakhs? every day of the calendar?

Message-ID: <cdc8c4430703031025o1282e377w5c2df757b274fc89@mail.gmail.com>

I have installed OSS driver on my Fedora Core 5 and run KDE.

Problem is : unable to play any kind of audio files (right plugins for
mp3 / ogg / vorbis are available too).

Error I get on the standard console is :

** WARNING **: oss_open(): Failed to open audio device (/dev/dsp):

I have configured KDE for audio alerts on minimizing / maximizing /
closing apps and on such conditions I can hear the associated sounds
from the speakers.

Here is the output of "lspci -vv" :

Dear Shri Ramadhas,

Installed language-pack-ta, language-pack-ta-base, scim-module-tables, scim-
additional-table.

Added three lines into 75custom-scim_init :
export XMODIFIERS="@im=SCIM"
export GTK_IM_MODULE="scim"
export XIM_PROGRAM="scim -d"

Now rendering in firefox (when I read mails from my gmail account) has
improved. But still I can't figure out how to input tamil characters
into say this mail composer

I will be thankful for instructions for the next step

Hi,

Saturday, March 3, 2007. The code examples and
presentation are available at:

I'd like to thank Praveen for inviting me over (which
he didn't have to do). The interaction with the
students was good.

The schedule was a bit tight, and I didn't take any
pictures.

Open gedit... or any application where u can input.. may it be firefox'

Press Ctrl + Space...

From the right-down corner of the desktop a pop-will be shown...

There are some funny websites like in the motto to spread  their
product take mail address from the account and send some nonsense on
their own. Then person who sign up for all these thing need to be very
careful. is there any way to block all these things?

Most of these alarm kind of websites actually ask for the users email
account and password of the email account. Then they will send the stupid
invitation to all the contacts in the addressbook. Please dont give the
password of your email account in any of these websites.

Thanks,

KDE will run 'artsd', which used to hold the /dev/dsp. So kill that
deamon and try to run music player OR give all access /dev/dsp to
everyone and try.

Dont change the permissions of /dev/dsp

Add whichever user you want to play music as to group "audio"

As simple as that.

Subject: [Ilugc] Live Presentation in Linux
Message-ID: <200703051520.08664.tshrinivasan@gmail.com>

Friends.

I want to teach linux to my remot friends.
We may be in a same network or may be in  internet.

I need this kind of setup.

They all can connect to my linux and get a window open in their machine.
I can show anything on that window to all.
I may show the impress presentations, my shells, my configurations files, my 
settings etc.
I have to guide them by showing them and i have to talk them in voice, so that 
they can have a very very live session in the internet.

How to do it?

Please suggest. We can create virtual classrooms if we can.

Thanks,
T.Shrinivasan.

Hello All,

I had been to FOSS.NITC last weekend. (3rd and 4th March 2007) Second
continuous year I am there and I gave a talk and organised a BoF
session.

Talk: Icarus Verilog and Free EDA Tools, OpenMoko
BoF: Students contribution ot FLOSS.

Pictures are here
http://flickr.com/photos/tuxmaniac/sets/72157594571226878/

It feels nice to see a 4 speaker , one day event turn out into a 3
day, 40 speaker event in a matter of just three years. Wonderful
accomplishment. Keep rolling.

Edit the dump file. Delete all lines other  than DMLs and DDLs. Save it and
try as  you did a bove.


Another way to import dumps:
mysql -u root -p databasename
After fetching the password, You will be dropped into mysql console.

In the console type:
source filenamewithfullpath

eg.,
mysql > source /tmp/mysqldump.dump

Ignacius

Subject: [Ilugc] Linux distribution Server
Message-ID: <382380.56840.qm@web36802.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello Everyone,

My name is Vijay and I am involved with IIT in a number of their projects and working with the TeNeT group since I came back from Canada about a year or so ago. I used to be part of the organizers group running the linux/unix users group there, and was quite involved with the community.

In any case, I have been getting back to linux (as I am getting involved with some development work) and one of the things I notice when updating and downloading from distro mirrors is the lack of any Indian distribution server. When Indonesia has a few, its sad that there is not even one for India.

I have been talking to Atul Chitnis about it, and we are trying to do something on behalf of FOSS.in. A few days ago I came across an ftp running in IITM (ironically) which had some distros on them - though it didnt seem like it was synced regularly with the master servers. We are trying to see if there is something we can formalize with IITM, or maybe start fresh with servers and bandwidth.

I would like the support of the local LUG chapter in this regard, and anything we can all contribute towards this goal. Ofcourse, your suggestions would be quite welcome as well.

You can reach me at vijay@vijayanand.name for a speedier response.

I look forward to hearing from you, and hope to meet you guys in one of the meets these days.

Regards,
Vijay

iitm does have a fairly well updated mirror - but in some cases only
widely used subsets of a particular distro are mirrored.

If you miss any packages, or find any that are stale, the mirror owner
(prof sriram) is quite easy to reach.

That would be entirely separate from your doing anything at all with
most local LUGs in India, but that's an old can of worms that's best
left unopened.

What's ironic about it?  IIT-M has been hosting ilug-c for years now.

Oh - one more reality check about the lack of mirrors in India.

Given the way the Internet in India is built up [not very much peering
at all, despite having a "national internet exchange" up, running and
exchanging derisory amounts of traffic] - it is often far faster to sync
from a mirror in singapore or hong kong depending on where your ISP gets
upstream connectivity from.  Even for me - and I live in Adyar, less
than three or four miles from the IIT campus.

just shows, unless the 'white man' says its news, it is not news.  
This was announced at a Chennai lug meet over six months back by the  
person who placed the order, and support for the move has been  
discussed in the lug meets, on this mailing list and on the lug wiki.

it so happens that the listadmin of this list runs the server with  
the help of other lug members - so you have come to the right place

I would make a point that good peered bandwidth in India is still 
prohibitively expensive for even big organisations. Most of the IITs/IIS do 
have mirrors but its for their own usage, but except for IITM none has 
announced it for public usage

IISc had a sunsite mirror, as well as some other distro mirrors - but
this is as of years back.  sunsite.serc.iisc.ernet.in is still up and
running but with a rather old looking wu-ftpd 2.6.1(1), that was the
default for I think RH 6.2 - and for example "dir" gives me a 421
service not available error.

Doubt if the mirror is being maintained now - it it is not, it'd
probably be best to take it offline till the box is patched .. versions
upto 2.6.2 (the latest) have their fair share of security holes.

One more point, cost of the CD/DVD is very less (~Rs30), when compare
to the bandwidth cost and time that we need to spend to download the
complete distro.

And already WE have to local distro (virtual) server at

Theplanet / ev1 is not bad and neither is rackspace if you want
dirtcheap colocation with cpanel boxes etc.

Softlayer (formed by a bunch of ex theplanet execs) has significant spam
problems - lots of spammers used to be hosted there, better situation
now but ..

Other places like XO (http://www.xo.com), Pair (http://www.pair.com) - a
bit costlier but well worth the money.

Dear Ilugies

Around 2 days back I was trying to convice my marketing director about
switching over to linux for certain machines in my company. In the course of
the discussion he asked a seemingly simple question "as to how is linux more
secure than windows even though the source code of linux is available
whereas the source code for windows is not available". Can anybody help me
to answer this question.

Thanks and Regards
Vinayak

US is expensive - try hetzner.de (a lot of us use this and are  
satisfied)

caveat: 1. you need to know a bit of german. 2. i dont get commission  
from hetzner

The first and foremost of security is the least dependency on the software
vendor itself. one example i heard from fsf friends. a bangalore based
company invested some lakhs to develop a software to suit their needs. they
approached a software developer and got it designed and developed to suit
their needs. they failed to get the source code or were ignorant of that.
they next year when they turned back for enhancement the developer could not
be found out. had they been aware of the importance of source code and power
this would have been a minimal loss.

as long as relationship goes smooth with the software vendor its honey. when
it starts itching, source code does matter a lot. :-)

imagine two huge buildings. he wants to rent one for an office. Both  
are in a place where earthquakes and terrorist acts are common. For  
one, he is given a complete building plan, clearly marking all the  
exits and entrances and the complete wiring etc of the building  
showing all maintainence passageways, ducts etc. For the other, he is  
told that no plans are available or can be shown because terrorists  
might get access to them - but since the details of the building are  
top secret, no terrorist can misuse the details. Regarding wiring and  
things, they say, we cannot give you the details, but give us the  
ends of the wires and we will connect them for you - same for exhaust  
pipes etc etc. Which building will he choose?

Message-ID: <600880.24401.qm@web25403.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I am trying to run a DNS server and get the ip
assigned to a name.  I use bind service for the same.

After I run the bind service (service named start):
16128 ?        Ssl    0:00 /usr/sbin/named -u named -c
/etc/named.caching-nameserver.conf -t
/var/named/chroot

The configuration file used by the "bind" is
/etc/named.caching-nameserver.conf and in that file, I
have an include directive to the list of zonal
entries.
"
include "/etc/named.rfc1912.zones";"

File named.rfc1912.zones is rightly placed.  (Until
this point, I didn't change any and all are what
Fedora provided).

I have an entry inside named.rfc1912.zones for my
zone(file).
zone "imslab1.localdomain" IN {
        type master;
        file "open-ims.dnszone";
        notify no;
};

File open-ims.dnszone is attached.  

If I give a command,
#dig @144.190.76.187 scscf

I do not get an answer

I got so many of this messages and I thought let me check out this
tagged. It forces you to give your gmail password (I have seen many
sites which gives you an option to use gmail, yahoo or hotmail address
book as an option, but this site won't let you go to next step unless
you give the password) and I refused and first thing I did was to
cancel my subscription.

That site is an utter crap.

The answer is there in the question. You have the
source code.

Tell him what is source code and what is a binary
executable.

Software intrinsically is a complex beast. When the source code is
available, people who have no ulterior motives can point out defects and
maybe even fix it themselves. Though there is no money in doing this bug
detecting and fixing, the recognition and the accompanying prestige is heady
stuff for many. More so for the brighter ones! And because of this a lot of
bright ones pore over open source applications (the popular ones) looking
for bugs. So, even before (or atleast as soon as) the bad guys can get to
exploiting it, the bugs get detected and fixed.

In  contrast, the number of people who get to look at the source code of a
closed source app - the employees of the company which builds it - is
limited.... even for someone as big as Microsoft! And the motivations of
these employees are not always prestige and recognition! Compounding this
situation is the fact that a hell a lot of information can be gleaned just
by black box testing an application. And it is usually the bad guys who
indulge in these stuff. Because good people who indulge in such stuff can be
penalized for breaking the licensing terms! So, it is always the bad guys
who know of a defect in a closed source tool ..... much much before even the
company which built it!

QED

Hope this helps in convincing your boss :-)

You got to learn to manage your mail IDs.
You just can't give your Id and passport and be ignorant.
It is his responsibilty to manage and know what mails are being delivered
from his account.

if required maintain a separate mail ID for public mails like the iluc.

Dear Ilugies

Thanks a lot for the clarifications. I think now I can go and convince my
boss about shifting to linux and saving money.

Thanks and Regards

This is one of the main problems in the views of people.  They tend to 
look at FLOSS as an approach to saving money (free as in free lunch) as 
opposed to having freedom (free as in speech).

Take a gun with you.

Some points which might help you in convincing him:
- Avoiding "Vendor Lockin"
- Return on Investment, Total Cost of Ownership
- Availability of Support (and the cost factor)
- Interoperability : high in FOSS
- Stability of the software (Industrial strength software e.g. for networks)

Now, you might need numbers, for which you will need to do some
googling on these.

However, there are certain other practical factors which must be taken
into acount. Availability of an experienced person to administer the
installations at your end, for example (yes, you might learn it on job
as well :) Next, the learning factor. You might find it desirable for
your Accounts and Administration department to use Linux desktop with
Open Office, but there should be eagerness on their side as well. Things
can be forced upon, as a management decision, but might not turn up well
accepted. All you will get is cribbing remarks (believe me, i have experienced
this!)

You need to be doubly careful if your installations has anything to do
with your clients. SLA, Client's policies etc. will come in the way, if at all.

Along side, first of foremost of all, freedom to use the software for 
whatever reason you wish to use it for ;)

Linux is not only free,  it is "open". 

A good comparison between Windows and Linux is
available in Wikipedia page. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_vs_windows

Comparisons are grouped under the topics of 

1. Total Cost of ownership
2. Installation
3. Accessibility and usability
4. Stability
5. Support
6. Security

Business understands the language of money. Their bonus and incentives
depend upon how much money they helped save or earn.

Welcome, to the real world.

if they cant save money in the long run - f/oss is no use. What is  
wrong is thinking of saving money in the short run - in the short  
run, f/oss, properly done, is more expensive than proprietary - it is  
in the long run that huge savings are made.

Can you explain how it is expensive in the short run?  You mean training 
people and stuff?  Because I've seen a similar proposal for using MS 
Windows IIRC

what everryone seems to ignore is the OP had asked the question: 'how  
is it secure in spite of the fact that the code is available' . This  
means that the assumption is: "if the code is available, then  
malicious parties will be able to crack the software easily'. The  
trouble with our people is that they are so enamoured of the word  
'freedom' that they ignore the question asked and immediatly begin to  
spout their mantras.

Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow - applies to security as 
well IMHO.

installation is expensive unless it is do-it-yourself. Good people to  
install are expensive. Training and migration - again expensive.  
Installation for doze is pretty cheap because manpower is easily  
available, and migration is not an issue at all since most people are  
familiar with it.

precisely - so talk of how open source is more secure *because* it is  
open - a concept very difficult to understand and put across

So, need to mention to the marketing folks about:

* GPG-signed binary packages in distro repositories or
in free/open source package hosting websites.

* Only developers get access to commit to CVS
repository, which is again reviewed by other
developers, and people who do testing.

* All changes/commits to CVS updated in project logs,
so everyone gets to know what is *happening*.

Apart from convincing about security, install the latest distro in one

An average company who wants to use some software does
not have geeks who can modify code of a 10k line
program,so freedom to modify code is a point which
wont impress any CEO.

The 'freedom' from 'vendor lock in' is definitely a point that will
impress a CEO. And., thats what 'freedom to modify code' gives you.

Message-ID: <4586230B-7E88-4964-8AC2-68D2226364A6@thenilgiris.com>

hi,
i was making a crude web interface to scilab. All i did was run  
popen2 to open two files for std_in and std_out and read the output  
and publish it. Code is like so:

f,g = popen2(path/to/scilab --options) #f is std_in and g is std_out
f.write(scilabcommand)
f.close()
print g.readlines()

this works fine, for some output, but if the output is more than 10  
lines, the output pauses and asks 'more?', at which time, in the  
interactive prompt, one presses enter to get the 'more'. The problem  
is unless i do f.close(), g does not get written to. And if i close  
f, i cant then use f to input an 'enter' character to get the 'more'.  
Any ideas?

If you don't have geeks in house, there are companies that provide
services which is available for you. If you don't have geeks yo pay
$$. Either way you get to do what you want to do with the software.

Dear Ilugies

I have a mail server running FC5 in my company. The hard disk capacity is

Keep watching periodically to see if the number of bad sectors increase.
If they keep increasing., there is a hardware problem with the drive. If
so., the best would be to change the drive.

Suggestion: You can run software raid using two 160GB hard-drives. It is
pretty easy to setup on gnu/linux with 'mdadm'. It'll save a lot of
trouble for you in the longer run, and is not very expensive. Just costs
another hard-drive.

Easy. Remove your hard disk from your PC, open the hard disk case with
pliers. Then take a hammer and thoroughly smash the disk.

You'll suddenly get a disk full of bad sectors.

Or maybe use strong magnets?

Message-ID: <c021e3c90703080140v7d88dd76w68a6c488644df879@mail.gmail.com>

Is there any way I can rotate a 64x64x64 raw dataset in OpenGl? The dataset
is having 4bits/pixel.  In OpenGl I could find out a method to paste the
image (of 24bits/pixel) on 6 faces of a cube and then rotate the CUBE in 3D
space.Still I am not able to do the same for 4bits/pixel.

P.S. The link that Toufeeq gave has proved very useful for
me.Everyonetrying to learn OPENGL must see it-->

Hey does anyone have an idea about how to recover data from a usb pen drive.
One of my friend has accidentally deleted a file which was very important to
him. Can someone suggest how to get back the file.

nobody will take you seriously if you keep mailing in SMPS-Speak.  
What is the meaning of 'r u ppl'? Can you not type 'are you people'?  
And why do you keep on top posting?

its usually formated fat32 and theres likely to be either a folder
.Trash in there or it can be unrecovered using tools that unrecover data
in fat32

windows only tools i think though

If he's written further data to the drive after that he's probably
screwed though

well, i dont know if spreading the message of FOSS is the raison d'etre -

i have not come across this much. if there are specific individuals who 
use unacceptable language, i will surely take a look and step in. i have 
never received any complaints in this regard.

i dont know about showing supremacy but if help is not forthcoming, that 
would be sad indeed. there may be a few individuals who insist on having 
the last word, but if the requiste help has been rendered we should just 
overlook this. free support is prone to come with this kind of add-on!

Dear Ilugies
In my company I have got a FC5 box working as the linux email server. The
main work this does is collect mails from an external mail server and then
distributes the mail locally. Mails which are generated within the company
and which are addressed to the company domain are distributed locally. What
I would like to know is that suppose a person with the id
a...<http://groups.google.co.in/groups/unlock?msg=52042eecd14526e1&hl=en&_done=/group/comp.mail.sendmail/browse_thread/thread/554960939f773714/52042eecd14526e1%3Fhl%3Den>
@xxxx.com(this id exists in the local mail server) sends a mail to a person
with id x...<http://groups.google.co.in/groups/unlock?msg=52042eecd14526e1&hl=en&_done=/group/comp.mail.sendmail/browse_thread/thread/554960939f773714/52042eecd14526e1%3Fhl%3Den>
@xxxx.com(this id does not exist in the local mail server but exists in the
external mail server) is there any way to force sendmail to try sending it
to the external mail server. Right now what is happening is that it bounces
back
saying user not found.

Google for "mailhub configuration"

Easiest way is to create "madras.yourdomain.com" - and if you have a
public, static IP (which you can get from any dsl provider), set that up
with MX and A records for your static IP

madras.yourdomain.com.	IN	MX	10	madras.yourdomain.com.
			IN	A	your.static.ip

Then you'd have to have some way of syncing the userdb across the place

There should be reasonable cookbook configs for whichever mailserver
you're running - I would recommend a common userdb across the actual
mailserver and the local one

Please do not mind, but let me give you my frank opinion, since you
persist.

Difference between 'r u ppl' and "are you people": one is a set of
characters used as shorthand for SMSing, while the other is a phrase
which makes complete sense to anyone with a decent command over the
English language.

Personally, yes, I do NOT want to understand "r u...", partly because
I take time to compose complete words and expect others on the list to
do the same. Most others do.

> damn!

You have been told not to top post so many times. Is it that you don't
understand or you don't want to understand?

Damn! (No, I never use such words, except when someone else uses it.)

Zico,

This lists guidelines doesn't recommend the use of sms-speak. "r u ppl" 
is not recognized as a proper English for conversation/interaction in 
this mailing list. Am sorry I can not help if you had joined this 
mailing list without reading the mailing list guidelines. But, all 
members in this list are expected to follow the guidelines and assumed 
that they have read and agreed to the guidelines.

This is what people had been trying to push into you. Hope you 
understand now. This is not just in this mailing list, but in almost all 
mailing lists, related to FOSS at least, as well as many IRC Channels.

        The difference, insofar as it impacts you, is that you are the
 one coming looking for information; and the people who inhabit these
 mailing lists and have the information and knowledge you seek also
 have rules of discourse.

        You do not have to follow the rules, of course, like not top
 posting, and creating grammatical and properly spelled questions.
 But then, there is no reason for people to cater to your requests;
 and not just kill file you.

        So, since in latter mails you seem to have discovered the
 value of interacting in a manner that the group deems polite:
__> man -k badblocks
badblocks (8)        - search a device for bad blocks
mbadblocks (1)       - tests a floppy disk, and marks the bad blocks
                       in the FAT 

        Also, e2fsck (check a Linux ext2/ext3 file system) can be told
 about bad blocks through n external file.

Subject: [Ilugc] configure doesn't find the installed libraries
Message-ID: <526626.18362.qm@web25405.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I am trying to install an application a that requires
libraries x, y, z.

I first compile and install x (and later y and z) in
/usr/local/lib (default).

Now, when I run configure for application a, the
configure complains "x not found.  x is a must if you
need to install a".  I could see the libraries present
in /usr/local/lib folder, but configure doesn't seem
to be recognizing it.

I tried running ldconfig after including
/usr/local/lib folder in /etc/ld.x.x.conf.  ldconfig
-p does show me the output for library x.   Tried
setting $LDFLAGS, $LIBS to -L/usr/local/lib, but the
configure of application a doesn't seem to realize it.


I am trying to install libopenikev2_impl which needs
libopenikev2.

[root@imslab lib]# pwd
/usr/local/lib
[root@imslab lib]# ls -l libopenikev2*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root      843 Mar  8 15:47
libopenikev2.la
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       21 Mar  8 15:47
libopenikev2.so -> libopenikev2.so.0.0.3
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       21 Mar  8 15:47
libopenikev2.so.0 -> libopenikev2.so.0.0.3
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  5406274 Mar  8 15:47
libopenikev2.so.0.0.3

Running configure of libopenikev2_impl results in 
checking for main in -lopenikev2... no
** ERROR ** You must install libopenikev2 in order to
compile libopenikev2_impl.

I am terribly struck here.  Please let me know if I
had missed anything.

Thanking in advance,
Vignesh

Hi,

Yesterday (8th March 2007) I went to pay EB bill at EB office in
Pondybazar in T Nagar. I saw gnome desktop on one of the PC's visible,
 that was a supervisor's PC. The billing PCs were not visible. Is TNEB

You must notice that /usr/local/lib contains the binary shared
objects. However, to be able to build your package from source, you
need the headers corresponding to these libraries. These headers are
ususally present in a "dev" or "devel" package for that software.

For example, you might have the GTK+ ".so" files, but without the
GTK+ "devel" package, you will not be able to compile and link GTK+ programs.

Have you installed libopenikev2 from source? Do you have the headers?

if there's really multiple bad sectors and its because of failing
hardware .. then you're best advised to get your data backed up

replacing the hard disk is the only cure, beyond a point

Thanks Prashanth, I shall try this.

Thanks to Bharathi : I agree with Suresh that changing the /dev/dsp
for the entire world may not be correct; killing artsd did not help
either.

Thanks Suresh : there is no group "audio" in my system files.

Hi all

Recently i heard that Microsoft is entering the Storage domain too, which
has been dominated by linux so far. We all know that MS is monopolizing each
and every domain day by day. You know the MS(with recent WinCE 6.0) handheld
market is
growing brighter! I wonder how the linux is going to survive the fight
against the gaint-MS. Or more spcifically, what are the domains/fields linux
can retain/expand its supremacy.

Regards,
Sripriyan

Good. If you compiled and installed it, just set the $PKG_CONFIG_PATH
variable to include $LIBRARY_INSTALL_PATH/lib. ie if x was in
/usr/local/x/ then do export
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/x/lib. In you case it is
just /usr/local/lib. Do this for every dependant library that you
install. Then compile the final source. It is usually the
<library_name>.pc file that resides in the pkgconfig directory that
sources the library's include details.

Note, if that did not work, try adding /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig to the
variable. I don't quite get the exact variable now!

Hope that helps.

A lame suggestion, but try adding
alias eth0 8139cp
<or>
alias eth0 8139too

to your /etc/modprobe.conf

I am not sure if that is right, though. Do correct me if that is
wrong. I wrote this because I did this a couple of times to get the
network card going.

You could probably use the following metaphor.
Say the encryption algorithms all of them are open , but the keys are
the ones private.
But still they are good at keeping the transaction secure.

Similarly , There are two different concepts , data and code.
Security in most sense is how safe the data can be , and that needs
intelligent code , more the number of participants and more trial and
error and more possible commits and development , better the code.Open
source achieves just that :) And explain to him his data will still be
confidential and its not 'open data' :)

Translation:

Am using Drupal 4.7. I want to use the Workflow Module and design a 4 
level workflow. If some one had done the same, please care to explain ?

Also, Livelink is being used for workflow related operations. Is there 
any alternative for this in Plone ?

Open a terminal and post output of:

  /sbin/lsmod
  /sbin/ifconfig -a
  /sbin/route -n

Note, you can redirect outputs to a file:

  /sbin/lsmod > lsmod.txt

Well, he talks about the market growing brighter. Following your above
lines, Linux should have the highest market share for desktop OSes as well,
but its not so, as we all know. Marketing strategy affects market share to a
great extent than the technical superiority of the product.

Does linux need to fight? Those who are intelligent enough to understand

this is my opnion arrived out of recent days conversation. I am happy
if i am wrong.

as far as i can see, the rules seeking to be enforced are:

1. posting in full english rather than sms-speak
2. putting meaningful subject lines - and not putting subject lines  
from digests which have no meaning
3. avoiding top posting
4. preventing birthday lists and tags and other invitations

can you please explain how these rules are 'axeing freedom'? How can  
you say that 'Rulers' are bullying others? Or are there other  
instances where freedom has been curbed? You should either  
substantiate your allegations or withdraw them. If, on the other  
hand, you feel the mailing list should have no rules at all, you are  
free to campaign for that and if you can convince the list admin, all  
rules may be removed and we can have total 'freedom'. but remember,  
there is a difference between freedom and anarchy.

it is now 49 euros for 320 gb hdd, 1 gb RAM, 1 tb data transfer and 6  
static IPs. Soft reboot and restart can be done from the control  
panel. Hard reboot has to be done by email - no extra charge. Comes  
with either debian or redhat, but you can put any distro you want. It  
is an unmanaged server - so far, in 9 months, 100% uptime. (at least  
it hasnt gone down to my knowledge)

The reason for using dual boot with Windows starter edition is that it
has many limitations. For example, in Windows starter edition the user
may not open more than 3 windows simultaneously (ex: firefox). Whereas
we all know, the user do not have such limitations in Linux.

As per Umashankar it would be the driving aspect for forcing them to
use Linux! Interesting aspect of this deal is the offer itself:

Desktop without OS: Rs.21800
Desktop with Winxp Starter edition pre loaded: Rs.21800
Desktop with Suse linux enterprise edition: Rs.21800

The ELCOT negotiated for dual boot for Rs.22000. Please refer to
egovindia yahoo group for tons of interesting emails sent by
Umashankar in this context.

49 euros for month!!  Good deal. But I cannot afford :(
Anyway who installs the OS? I want an customized OS to be installed.
Bio-Nix, a fedora based distro. If I ship the ISO files will the Install
it from me?  I remember Vaidhy, telling me about this.

If you pay 50SGD/month, and provide your own machine, you can host in
many data centers in SG. I had been to the datacenters, they are well
maintained, and well supported. It seems to be a better choice, as you
spend 1/3 per month, but supply your own box.

In many cases its the tone of the mail that seems rude and
intimidating than the intent of this mail, like the one I ve quoted
for! Nothing personal and I guess this topic is not very serious as of
now. We are not yet cursing the other and if we discussed this, we
just might end doing so.

Much of what looks like rudeness in hacker circles is not intended to
give offense. Rather, it's the product of the direct,
cut-through-the-bullshit communications style that is natural to
people who are more concerned about solving problems than making
others feel warm and fuzzy.

please read my original post - the skill set asked for was  
dreamweaver, macromedia and such like.  You may be suprised to know  
that even proprietary software uses the above. We use the above with  
tools like quanta, emacs, gimp, blender etc etc.

Hair splitting!

Which takes me to a deeper question (a recurring one to those who have read
my earlier posts): How does it matter to an artist whether the source code
of the tool he is using is available or not!! Say a painter has access to a
propreitary concoction that helps achieving superior results easier than
those for which the formulas are available! Should he forsake the
opportunity to create superior works of art?

Pls dont tell me that quanta, emacs, gimp can come anywhere close to
photoshop, dreamweaver with regard to ease of use!

The point is that the "any question about photoshop, dreamweaver or 
anything proprietary" doesn't come anywhere close to the purpose or 
intention of this mailing list. (exception may be if the OP is asking 
about an FOSS alternative to these softwares).

If you want to post about HTML, CSS, AJAX jobs you are free to do it 
here - but not Photoshop or Dreamweaver. You can say something like 
"Ability to work with HTML,CSS, AJAX and other proprietary tools"

But the OP's post read like "Web Designers with High creativity and 
amazing graphic
design abilities, knowledge of tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator,
Macromedia Dream Weaver, ..." so the more important qualifications being 
mentioned are no where near the interests of this mailing list.

Am afraid the OP is not looking only for an Open Source Web 
Developer/Designer with HTML, CSS, AJAX ?

** Again - this is not a job portal but a Linux User Group's Mailing 
List. Please post relevant job opportunities only.

*** I am not making a rule or trying to be authoritative - just pressing 
the original purpose of this mailing list. If you think am wrong, you 
have the freedom to neglect this mail.

I think resume download is a feature of the download manager. I am not

Linux is growing at 30% per year or more in the server market. Windows
is growing at 5% per year in server market. 
I am supremely confident that you are new to Linux and probably a MS
user.  And why is that poor programmers are very expensive ? Did you
mean the marketing guys by the way.

Zico, People are here to help you for free. The question you asked
initially was "how to configure the bad sector in linux?". Is should
probably be "How do I fix bad sector problems in Linux". And it is
better if you include other information like, what exact error you are
getting, what OS you are using, which partition has bad sectors, etc. 

There are many ways to solve your problem. If you find bad sectors in
root or home partition, then I would recommend you to get into single
user mode, and run fsck. 

http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/redhat-fedora-linux-help/60822-how-enter-single-user-mode-grub.html 
explains about getting into single user mode. 

You can also use a livecd, to boot and run fsck on your hard disc.

Am I missing something? I can understand that this is a font issue!! I
use evolution. How do i fix this problem? I can only read "Drupal 4.7",
"Workflow Module", and "LiveWire" in the above mail. Or do I have to
install Indic Evolution?

Unless the server support HTTP 1.1 fully, the download manager can't do 
anything here. For more info,

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35.2
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/229704
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/misc/known_client_problems.html (see 
the Byterange section.)

I believe since apache 1.3 this feature is supported. If I am right, the 
parallel download by some client use this feature. This you can see in 
popular window only DMs like Flashget, Download accelerator,etc.,

Poor programmers are expensive as in, imagine what would happen to a company

nope. It all depends on the level of the professional. A professional  
needs professional tools. In certain areas foss products do not  
measure up. For example in dtp, scribus is nowhere near pagemaker or  
quark express. So a professional would have to use the latter -  
whether he likes it or not. As long as he pays for it, no problem.  
Similarly, in vector graphics, inkscape is not a patch on corel draw.  
On the other hand, gimp *does* compete with photoshop and  
professionals can use it. Likewise, blender is kick-ass professional  
animation software which can easily compete with the proprietary  
competition. In the mid- nineties, i used to use corel draw,  
pagemaker and photoshop, but had to stop because each of the cost  
around 25K and the business I was doing did not generate the revenue  
for me to keep upgrading - and my competitors were all using  
'free' (as in beer) versions. In this context note that creative dot  
accepts contributions composed using closed software on condition  
that the author has paid for the software

>

gimp competes favourably with photoshop, but the learning curve is  
steep. Dreamweaver is a piece of sh*t and no self respecting designer  
would use it anyway. Existing foss products cannot yet compete with  
illustrator, coreldraw, pagemaker, quark express. That said, when you  
factor in the cost of these, unless you are a fulltime, well earning  
professional, you *have* to make do with the foss tools. Question -  
how many people in this list, who have used any of the above tools  
have paid for them?

when curl is there, why worry? I used to use curl when i was on slow  
dialup - 14400 bps - and have successfully downloaded files of around  
100 mb at nighttime - used to take about 10 days per file.

 You can try writing a module for the same and open source it. People
would love it and you would be famous.
 Sorry, cant help you in writing module as I am yet to figure out, how
come resume download  is different from normal file access over web

It matters, only if it is let to matter.

I would buy a CRY or HelpAge card, If it matters to me as to where the
money goes and whether it helps the helpless. Else I will just buy any
card which pleases my taste (might as well be the CRY or HelpAge card).

Should he ? Shouldn't he? The artist in question knows better, who ever it is.

Are you asking that if it is possible to check for a user in multiple domains ?
Well its possible in postfix . So i think it should be possible in sendmail too.
There is a free orielly guide on postfix , in which this is clearly mentioned.

Depends on the filesystem ,
if its fat32 , try the .trash as somenoe has just said.
even if it is not there , you can possibly recover using recovery
tools like 'undelete' in windows.
In a delete what happens is only the fat entries are deleted , and the
file contents say intact , so even if you recover sometimes you dont
get the right name of the file but you will get the contents.So if the
files are media files its not a problem but if you want a set of files
for a single application , dont even bother trying undelete.
Sophisticated tools take upto an hour to run the whole process for
like 512 mb or 1 gb drive.

Allow users to login  to X from remote.
And they can login to your system using telnet or putty (ssh in windows)
For voice use gtalk or jabber.org with gaim .

Hi,

I conducted a "Careers with GNU/Linux and Free
Software" workshop on Saturday, March 10, 2007 at
Osmania University, Hyderabad.

I would like to thank Dr. Atul Negi (Vice-Chairman,
IEEE Hyderabad Section), Dr. Madhav Negi (Chairman,
IEEE Computer Society, Hyderabad Section) for their
support in this workshop.

Thanks to Santosh Arjun (Vice-Chairman, IEEE Student
Chapter, Osmania University) for working with me for
more than a month in organizing this workshop.

* This is the first time that I actually "flew" to a
workshop. Indian Airlines [1] flight was delayed by
two hours. The workshop was to start at 10:15, but, I
reached Hyderabad [2] only at 1200 noon. But, was able
to catch up with the sessions: Careers with GNU/Linux,
Free Software, GNU/Linux desktop, Embedded HOWTO,
Alliance VLSI CAD Tools HOWTO
(http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads.html). 

* The posters made for the workshop are available at:

http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/posters/flyer_workshop.pdf

http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/posters/flyer_workshop_2.pdf

* There were about 180 students from in and around
Hyderabad. There were students who came all the way
from Vijayawada (300 km) by bus, overnight, and I was
elated! 

* Students from other colleges who participated in the
workshop were eager to have similar workshops for
their colleges. I have agreed for the same.

* Was able to meet folks from Free Software
Foundation, Andhra Pradesh Chapter.

* I shall provide the organizers' contacts to NRC-FOSS
(Krishnan, Kenneth, Shrinivasan, Parthan, et. al.).

* I am still awaiting some photos from the students.
Once I get them I shall upload them and provide the
link.

Regards,

SK

[1] Please avoid in future. No refreshments were
served for  passengers waiting in the lounge, due to
the delayed flight. Further delay caused due to
engineering problems.

[2] Hyderabad is a Pretty Hot Place (PHP?).  It was 30
degree celsius, but, felt like 50!

Hmm., I think  you'd be able to see them if you have some tamil
font installed. Not very sure though.

Another lame suggestion. Please use some other recent version of
the distribution. RH-8 is just too old.

LOL. Best part is new people dont see this., and thats where all
the problems start. Most of them expect
sweet-(nonsense)-talk. :P. Anyways., should appreciate Zico for
attempting to change.

Specifically you can use 'fsck -c' to invoke the badblocks program
to do a non-destructive test. 

But you'll have to keep watching for occassional errors to see if
the badblocks count is growing. I dont know whether these guys at
ritchie street are informed enough to replace a hard-disk with
bad-sectors under warranty. Try your luck.

Hey
     Which Eth card are you using?.. Is it zebronics? I read some where 
that this company is using a fake RTL chipset in their board. I had the 
same problem with Debian etch also. FC4 is also not detecting this 
card.!!!!!!

Looking forward to read your reports.

BTW, a small suggestion. Can we have a calendar of FLOSS conferences in India ?

Something on these lines available in LWN:

ILUGHYD at least is quite emphatically a LUG, not a G/LUG (long back
story but the general consensus was that prefixing "GNU/" was not going
to happen.. it should be there somewhere in the list archives)

When you mark a bcc to the list, mailman defers the deilvery of that mail. But 
then it depends upon the individual mailman configuration i guess.

Message-ID: <69621d830703111026ob765a6dqd8989cb35e576b4b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello again.

I face a lot of problem when i go to install any deb package in my box. I am
using Ubuntu 6.06 LTS. Some hours ago, i tried to install xchm with apt-get
install xchm. But it showed me that, " no package like xchm found". Then i
got the deb package of xchm from package.ubuntu.com.

After that, when i go to install that deb package with dpkg -i .... then a
lot of dependency problem occured. After that, i tried to download+install
the dependcies..... but you know... there are also many dependencies in each
any every library, which i need to install xchm.

How can i survive from such horrible condition?

Zico

Hope u haven't enabled  the relevant repository. There are four repositories
in Ubuntu 1) Main 2) Universe 3) Multiverse and 4) Restricted.

License of a software decides which package to reside where!

You might not have enabled the repositary in which "xchm" resides. Please
verify from Synaptic package manager that relevant repositary is enabled.

by the way, what for is "xchm" used?

A lot of pirated ebooks come as .chm files. It is *Microsoft Compressed 
HTML Help Files*. It is basically used to create Help files in MS 
Windows. But, have seen a lot of pirated ebook copies of books being 
available in the Internet in this format.

Might be a good idea to drop the slashdot speak as well, stuff like +1?

It never hurts to use the same fluent and correct english.

In fact, even people who have the laudable goal of promoting tamil on
the list find that when they post questions in tamil, they need to post
an english translation before their question gets answered :)

its the hesitation that a common man has in delivering correct english,
which encourages use of their native language...

people who know both language can choose to translate... some time it may
not be possible.. at those situtions other members in the group can
volunteer to translate the tamil content to english... so that others can
also get benefitted...

not ASAP. If you use ASAP in a mail asking some question, you will

true - but unfortunately, the common man has to learn english - and  
good english if he wants to be a good programmer. This applies not  
only to tamilians, but also to argentines, portugese and greeks.

one question - *must* all the tamil used be senthamizh? I notice in  
popular magazines like tamil computer, a far more understandable type  
of tamil is used. Like they say 'computer' instead of kanini.

just posting a URL, where the content of the url pointed to is  
perfectly understood is not conducive to discussion. Simply posting  
URLs should be frowned upon. When posting a URL, one must also put a  
few words as to why the OP thinks it is interesting, or why he posted  
it. Of course everyone has broadband nowadays, so bandwidth is not  
wasted, but time is wasted clicking something that may or may not be  
of interest.

true true :-) english learnt only in that perspective but not as an
replacement of any mother tongue in day to day life :-)

kanini is almost now put into pratice or atleast understandable as
computer.. a stage has evolved where kanini is now identified as computer..
the desirable sitution would be a time where equlivalent terminology exists
and easily understandable for an individual in both languages.. just like
kathirikkai for brinjal etc.,

say for example, i would certainly not force ??????? to be used for network
at this point of time but will definitely choose to simultaneously mention
both of them.. so that in course of time it evolves as a replacement of
network and easily used understandable, synonymous to network...  just like
????? has evolved and easily identified with computer .

Yes. I agree that when the cost of these tools are factored in, FOSS
alternatives do have a strong case. Since, I was looking at it from the

I think it is something like moving gui to something like it is in windows now .
Like from ring 5 to ring 0 . where it is not just a app , but loaded
before boot as a driver.

First - I'm tamilian but my tamil has a weird accent (start with a
tirunelveli accent and then layer on the fact that I've spent less than
4 years of my life in madras), I can barely read bus and shop signs in
tamil, certainly can't read long paragraphs in newspapers, or
handwritten tamil letters from my late grandmother back when she was
alive, etc without a lot of effort. Tamil newspapers not worth that
effort - grandmothers letters certainly.

I was reading an excellent english translation of Kalki's Ponniyin
Selvan (published by Macmillan India, trans by CV Karthik Narayanan) and
the introduction to it had these facts .. Kalki was very well regarded
as a tamil scholar (by people like Thiru Vi Ka and others), and a
champion of tamil in music (which brought him into contact with MS and
Sadasivam of course, much to the benefit of music) ..

However he was in favor of modernizing tamil substantially, and was
completely against the highly sanskritized and formal tamil used by some
scholars (samples of such writing can be found in for example
"devotional" magazines, and the inhouse journals of the sringeri /
kanchi math, etc).  He was also completely against "sentamizh" which
steadfastly looked for pure tamil words "untainted" by sanskrit - even
referred to it as "kodunthamizh" - tortured tamil .. something that
various tamil purists, including Thiru Vi Ka - completely disagreed
with, even while they respected Kalki.  In fact Kalki's novels
modernized tamil literature the way that Bharathiar did Tamil poetry.

But that was the 30s and 40s.  The world has come a long way since then,
and so has "modern" tamil as spoken by the common man.

Tamil needs several degrees more modernization, including freely
adapting words from English for things like computing terms. After all,
English grew to where it is now by freely borrowing from every single
language under the sun (start with old anglo saxon, germanic and celtic
languages, add french and latin under the normans, layer on several
expressions from former british colonies - all the way from australia
and the USA to India / china / the middle east and persia, etc)

That is why english, as a language, is alive and constantly evolving.
And why the oxford english dictionary has thousands of words in it that
are derived from hindi, tamil, telugu, persian etc.

Please dont stick to chenthamizh, or doordarshan style tamil. Dont coin
entirely new tamil words, or adapt old tamil words like kanini (a
"counter" right?) for computer

projects who want google to sponsor students to work for them have to  
apply. When they apply google will give them slots. for example last  
year django got 6 slots and PSF got 25. Some projects got only one.

Ok. I agree with you on this, totally. But, sarcasm does not get the
point across. Lets not tussle any further. I think more bw and time
gets wasted in sarcastic remarks and comments. Its probablly better
used reading the URL and commenting.

you will notice that the OP is still to spell out precisely what he  
wants in response to his post. Sarcasm seems to have pushed him some  
way to that goal. Maybe he will reach there. As of now he has not got  
any benefit since no one knows what he wants.

Dear All,

I am extremely happy to announce bioubuntu-0.1 based on Ubuntu Edgy Eft (6.10) 
which is a live GNU/Linux cd with 30 bioinformatics packages covering 
pairwise alignment, multiple alignment, phylogeny and other miscellaneous. 
It is a customized ubuntu live distribution updated to bugfixes which aims
to introduce linux to biology/bioinformatics community thereby bring the 
power and ease  of ubuntu to biologists/bioinformaticians/computational biologists. 

we would shorty start with packaging other bioinformatics tools and
make them available in future versions of the bioubuntu. This BioUbuntu CD was
released at a workshop on " Trends in  Systems Biology and  Bioinformatics " 
 held at madurai kamaraj university (6-8 march 2007) funded by 
Department of Biotechnology, Government of India.

hello

I used have a few troubles with this myself , tho on a diffferent distro. Till i learnt that several companies like intex do not provide original RTL chipsets. I think both the C and D in RTL LAN adapters use 8139too module, if i am correct.
Cards from Compex have no trouble like this to the best of my knowledge.

What did you try? 

What is your hardware?

Which Linux kernel version?

> I want to know if there is any special
> kernel for Linux?

Linux _is_ the kernel.

A driver interacts with hardware and the kernel
subsystems. So, you will require the essential kernel
subsystems to exist for the driver to work.

For example, if you want to use USB controller drivers
(ohci_hcd or ehci_hcd or uhci_hcd), you need the USB
subsystem (usbcore) support enabled in the Linux
kernel.

partly agreed. tamil is the language which even accepted to adopt
"characters" from other language. like ?, ?, ???? etc., to overcome
pronounciation problems... Tamil is indeed adoptable and dynamic to changing
environment.


That is why english, as a language, is alive and constantly evolving.

certainly.. as i said tamizh has done it and will do it will all your
co-operation..

But, Please do not say this to the French President. The neighbour of
Britan. ;-)

we people use ????? in day to day life. hence its common tamil for us and

Quite frankly, I hear the words for various directions (vadakku, therku
etc) used on a daily basis.  "Kanini" for computer is a word I havent
heard used .. even by those of my relatives who are far better educated
at tamil than I am (as in, can quote sangam era poetry that quite
legitimately did not have any tinge of sanskrit in it because it
predates the aryan influences on tamil nadu).  I keep hearing them say
"laptop" (madi mel?) or "computer".

i see something positive here.. if you have relatives who know better
tamizh.. can u request them to help us in our efforts :-)

ok.. np... lets make it common by using it :-)  when theru (????), nagar
(????), kiraamam (???????) which were in common practice are in danger of
becoming street, town and city..

This list may be termed Chennai Linux Users but if non-tamilians are
to contribute or benefit then use of common language is expected as
courtesy to all just like other mailing etiquette's.

Agreed. Looking at these tamil written mails from ilugc in my inbox,
gives me a feeling that there is a sub-group within ilugc who are
communicating and discissing within themselves ....
makes me clueless.

Not sounding sarcastic or authoritative.. lets hide "Chennai" and consider.

[1] I am happy that your English is good such that we (or at least I) 
could understand what you meant to say. If you are not good in English 
and you do know how to type in local language, then which language would 
you have preferred to ask the question ? (Not bringing in the argument 
that still you could have asked the question in English, that only 
mistakes make a man perfect. But people has to understand what one means 
to correct his mistakes correctly ;-) )

[2] If you don't know Tamil but only Hindi, then you can very well ask 
your question in Hindi. Am sure that there are quite a number of people 
who can understand Hindi, reply you back or at least (as I did a few 
days ago) translate your post to English.

[3] The OP's post was about assistance and contribution to Tamil 
translation for KDE and hence it is not of much problem of the OP to 
convey it in Tamil. :)

There was another mail today that was Tamil and english which at least
gave an insight as to topic under discussion - pure vs vernacular
tamil. But just a mail totally in tamil (or tamizh) is inviting only
one action "del"button and if too many of these need to be pressed
then unsubscribe option. But I have heard a lot about this list so
waiting and watching in the meanwhile :-(

Comon denominator works best. I know I can post in Hindi or Punjabi
(my mother tounge) but I would rather use something that the iwder
audience listening in is able to get involved. As I have already
commented on another post interspread with tamil and english.

And before you (or others) get impressions otherwise I am for
localisation and consider this as one of the strengths of OSS but we
have to admit that english does serve as communication and expression
medium if you have to go for wider inputs.

Kudos for your translation help et el.

Yes. I also dont have any other option too. Nowadays my delete button
is more frequently used on this list. And more fiery are the attitudes
of some people. I can be specific on a lot of "specific" issues but in
the interest of the list I am not listing them down. Also tamil is
fine but _as long as_ there is a translation of whatever is conveyed
following it. People would say that I am not the one to decide and
some such, but I am rising a voice of opinion for quite a lot of
people.
Also when a technical query is put forward I see more people trying to
find faults in the question than trying to answer them. Not a good
sign at all. Yes, you can request them to follow List guidelines but
not comment in such a way to start a flamy thread with a "Was Re: blah
bha".

Hope this is taken in good spirit.

Reggies.

LOL! You need not ever press that unsubscribe button if you have the 
patience to go through loads of flames and still hope there will be some 
really interesting questions ;)

I am sorry you feel like so because the volume of other *English* mails 
has been low. And a small tip, we do press 'delete' for a lot of mails 
which we get in the list. So, better learn to check mails which is of 
your interest and discard the rest which makes your head whirl :)

Its all because of that "Authoritative" mail sent by some member
saying "Tamil can be used on this list" or some such. Anyway nice to
see a lot of Tamil mails but my humble/sincere request to those people
is please follow it up with a English Summary (even if you are not
good at english :-) )

Easy way to go would be to come to the LUG meeting and talk, or skype
with someone you know from the list and discuss with him ..

no flames will result - a convention has started that when putting   
[thamizh] tag in the subject line, posting in tamil is allowed - and  
you can always ask for a translation. Some one will surely oblige.  
And this particular thread is concerned with tamil translation of kde  
- so it would not be of interest to a person not knowing tamil anyway

Hi
Recently my Uncle who stays at Arumbakkam expressed an interest in
trying out linux. I sent him a Ubuntu CD. However he is a total novice
with computers on the whole. I tried to help him over the phone but it
proved to be very tough. Does any of you stay close to Arumbakkam? If
so would you be gracious enough to help him set up a usable linux
system on his PC.
Thanks

Quite interesting when patti(?????) becomes kiraamam (???????) in tamizh;
then why not village (????????)?

As for as I feel, if there are certain words that are already there (or that
can be derived directly) to find a place in Tamizh lets use them. provided
that didn't bring any amusement or ambiguity;  one such example - device
driver may not be word by word translated to "?????/???????? ???????? ?" .
but some thing that gives more meaning to the context. if there is no words
already there for this term then we could say ???????????? than using the
same term as "?????? ???????"
 By the way is there any other term for the above in tamizh.

the second is correct - the first uses driver in the sense of a human  
driver

You can preview a few paragraphs from each chapter at
http://safari.oreilly.com/0672327201

For more you'd either have to buy the book, or pay to read it online

If you say it is free to download, it is most likely pirated, so please
keep that off ilugc.

Give him a ubuntu livecd so he can put it in his cd drive, reboot and
get linux .. he can play around with it, and if he's more comfortable
with it, he can install a dual boot sometime later.

in my exerience with novices, this wont work. In the first place, the  
machine is probably set to boot off the harddrive and needs a cmos  
setup change to boot from Cd - that alone would daunt him. I tried  
the other day, instructing a hardware *dealer* in coimbatore to setup  
an airtel internet connection in mandriva - where it is all gui - and  
failed miserably.

Now this is just junk;  you can claim that allowing posts in other
languages will help newbies who can't phrase themselves in English,
but have the setup to post in Tamil, but posting in Tamil just for the
heck of it, will just make everyone filter messages tagged [Tamizh] to
the Spam folder/label/whatever.

tamil is fine - it appears on the language list. For the helpline  
website, to view different languages, one has to set the default  
language in the browser - if the default is polish, i see polish. But  
telugu and kannada are not getting shown in the drop down list in  
firefox's add language dialogue

Please try perl audio converter - pacpl ,
you can search for it in freshmeat.net.
sox can also do it but quality is not good.
Or you can first convert the file to wav and use 
oggenc.

TPD.

Exactly.
If you want to help the newbies who can't follow instructions in
english, then please contribute by writing HOWTOs in Tamil.
Maybe we can have a seperate category in the wiki to have Tamil HOWTOs.

I have created a new page in the wiki

Dear Friends,

I would like to know how mail threading mechanism works. I want the
mails to be grouped Chronologically as what Gmail does, this is the
need for my application.
Is that manipulating the In_Reply_to and Reference_id tag in the
header alone will give me a finite solution to my problem. How to go
about for implementing this need. Thanks in advance for any pointers.

Message-ID: <c021e3c90703140355o55682dcahf1fc97d8daf6dcce@mail.gmail.com>

I tried to make the kernel size running on my P.C as small as
possible.Myhardware configuration is
2.4 intel Celeron,Intel 845 chipset (from GIGABYTE),Sony CDROM,80GB ATA
IDE,samsung keyborad.One among thousands of step that I tried was to remove
all the unnecessary drivers.

For this in menuconfig I selected device driver and did the following
changes:

1.In old CDrom drivers: I removed all drivers except sony drivers and
support for non-SCSI IDE cdroms.

2.In block devices I checked on Parallel port IDE drivers.

3.In ATA/ATAPI i checked only IDE/ATA2 disk support.

4.Checked all the SCSI drivers.

5.Removed all old CDROM drivers.

6.Removed multi device support.

7.Didnt touch IEEE1394, MPT device and I20 device

8.Removed all the ISDN drivers,Telephony support.

9.Left the networking support drivers in its default selection.

10.Removed most of the drivers from input devies.

11.Character devices I had no idea how to check the driver only for my
samsung keyboard.

12.I didnt touch multimedia,sound,graphics and USB support.

The GUI for Linux amazed me because of the X11 topic in it.I could not make
much out of the article.

Is there any special version of Linux for embeded systems??Where can I find
information on them??

aMBUJ

:)

P.S. I dont have any knowledge about the devices in point-7.

No. Expect for arch specific sessions, other core kernel part is same
for all the system. In the embedded system, you may need board
specific driver, that is not the part the kernel source, it may be
supplied with Board Support Package(BSP).

For more info: Visit uclinux, mips-linux, arm-linux, ppc-linux,  
project sites.

Message-ID: <45F7EB6C.5030708@midascomm.com>


Hi all,

Can anyone tell me, during installation of a linux system(say redhat 
9.0), how the anaconda is ejecting the first cd and asking for the 2nd 
cd. I want to understand how it is able unmount the cd that is in 
currently in use.

Actually I want to modify the kickstart file, so that in the post 
installation it will unmount the last installation cd and eject it, ask 
for another custom cd(similar to how the anaconda handles ejecting the 
1st cd and asks the 2nd cd), which will install some software and then 
system will reboot.

Is this possible to do? any pointers??

As Pavithran has said, you can try out Mplayer. Or, get one of the
other players, like vlc, xine etc.

But I want to know why your RHEL 4 is "eminent". :-)

Yes there is an embedded Linux available....

?Clinux (MicroControllerLinux) is a derivative of the Linux kernel for microcontrollers (?Cs, embedded systems) without a memory management unit (MMU).

Since there is npo MMU present there is no concept of address spaces (and further 'Copy on Write')

uClinux was originally derived from version 2.0.38 (1996) of the Linux kernel, it now has ports based on Linux 2.4.0+ and Linux 2.6.

The embedded os has support for many architectures, and forms the basis of many products, like network routers, security cameras, DVD or MP3 players, VoIP phone or Gateways, scanners, and card readers.

Subject: [Ilugc] GUI in Linux


I tried to make the kernel size running on my P.C as small as
possible.Myhardware configuration is
2.4 intel Celeron,Intel 845 chipset (from GIGABYTE),Sony CDROM,80GB ATA
IDE,samsung keyborad.One among thousands of step that I tried was to remove
all the unnecessary drivers.

For this in menuconfig I selected device driver and did the following
changes:

1.In old CDrom drivers: I removed all drivers except sony drivers and
support for non-SCSI IDE cdroms.

2.In block devices I checked on Parallel port IDE drivers.

3.In ATA/ATAPI i checked only IDE/ATA2 disk support.

4.Checked all the SCSI drivers.

5.Removed all old CDROM drivers.

6.Removed multi device support.

7.Didnt touch IEEE1394, MPT device and I20 device

8.Removed all the ISDN drivers,Telephony support.

9.Left the networking support drivers in its default selection.

10.Removed most of the drivers from input devies.

11.Character devices I had no idea how to check the driver only for my
samsung keyboard.

12.I didnt touch multimedia,sound,graphics and USB support.

The GUI for Linux amazed me because of the X11 topic in it.I could not make
much out of the article.

Is there any special version of Linux for embeded systems??Where can I find
information on them??

P.S. I dont have any knowledge about the devices in point-7.

IEEE 1394 is firewire [1] port for real-time data used
with camcorders.

MPT is a Fusion MPT [2] (Message Passing Technology)
from LSI that provides a SCSI host initiator.

I20 [3] is Intelligent Input/Output (I20)
architecture, that allows you to split the
functionality of hardware drivers.

For more details on specific options, you can check
the "Help" link when you do "make menuconfig". For 2.4
Linux kernels, it is present in the Config.in file in
the kernel sources, and for 2.6 kernels, it is present
in the Kconfig file in the kernel sources.

You should probably look at small footprint Linux distros like 
floppylinux, coyote linux, damn small linux, uclinux etc. Most of them 
have no GUI and are targeted for specific environments like LEAF, 
routerlinux for routing/firewall applications etc...

incorrect! there is no repodata on rh9. hdlists are parsed and the 
package order worked out from there.

the logic for what ?

Sivaram, firstly you should not be using rh9 for anything anymore - its 
not supported and the packages included in that tree contain security 
and bug issues. You should consider rebasing to something more recent 
and something supported a bit.

and yes, if you ever intend to make sense out of pkgorder - look at the 
prebuild anaconda script set.

For Anaconda? I thought anaconda expects a repodata

repodata in:
http://rh-mirror.linux.iastate.edu/fedoralegacy/redhat/9/os/i386/

unmounting the first CD, ejecting it.

look at the isos' for rh9 - you will not find anything like that in there.

that url you are pointing at is only a repo of package made available on 
the net by fedora legacy to satisfy depends for other packages they were 
helping with, not always a part of the core distro. Its not an 
installable tree.

>> the logic for what ?
> 
> unmounting the first CD, ejecting it.

I dont think you need to do that at all. There should be no real need 
for user interaction at install time. The moment you enforce a need to 
ask for user input, you break the idea of automated installs. And you 
loose the ability to install using other media eg. what about users who 
want to install from a http or nfs hosted tree ?

Any user interactive installer options should be handled as modules for 
firstboot, that is run immediately after the first time the machine 
boots, post-install.

If you dont need any user feedback at all, and the kickstart is smart 
enough to make decisions required, then the extra rpms should be 
included in the install media, and the ks.cfg file should be scripted to 
use ( outside the chroot ) /mnt/source/<path to rpms>/

kg you have hit the bulls eye. I had tried almost 30 minutes over the
phone to get this part going and failed. Any case thanks guys for the
help. Mr. Shrinivasan has agreed to help my uncle. I think this kind
of support is very crucial in spreading linux into the non-techie
community.

This requirement in RH9 came as an unavoidable emergency.
What I am trying to do is , I have my own software to install after the
Linux Installation. I want my software installation to happen before the
reboot of the system, after Linux installation(ie, on first boot of the
system my software should run). I wanted to try if that's possible by
tweaking around the post installation of kickstart for that.

Thanks guys, I will try what I can do.

One of the basic requirements of language is not whether a concept can be
expressed, but how easy is it express the concept and whether we can think
anf talk in it..  Almost all the suggestions given here would be unpalatable
to a common man.. Why are we so set on a literal translation of a engilsh
term into tamil without thinking about how to express the concept in tamil?

Device = Karuvi
Driver = Iyyaki
Software = menporul (in fact, soft = men, ware = porul)

<rant>
I still remember the translation from Sri, where the simple concepts have
such a convluted wording in Tamil that it is close to unusable. I do not
intend to demean the effort of translating things to Tamil, but the effort
should be aimed at having the man on the street be understand it.
</rant>

Having gotten that off the chest, I realized that the confusion occurs
because the term became popular in another language first. Well, maybe when
we invent things first, we will give it a tamil name and make others
translate it into their language.

Cheers,
Vaidhy

How about "device driver" instead?.

This process is starting to remind me of that khushwant singh joke about
the indian railways wanting to translate things into hindi .. and
translating "train" into "loh pad gamini yaan" (vehicle  that moves on
iron tracks).

The common people will definitely prefer "karuvaadu" to "karuvi" so
trying to coin weird words is not going to impress them.

Hi Bala,
 When I click on the xpi file, it opens for download unlike other
plugins. I am not sure what is wrong. But I downloaded your file and
opened it from local disk, then it opened for installation.

"The Code" is freely distributable under the CC

You need to buy a copy:

Nice thing. One problem I had was that it moved the icons in the menu 
bar (top row with menu entries that I'd customised to carry icons) to 
the right. Looks like you make and entry in the menu bar not expecting 
anything else beyond the menu.

Post installation interpreter(/bin/sh) did not work out as I expected. 
When I gave umount /mnt/source, it gives an error that /mnt/source is 
not identified and some of the basic commands like mount is not printing 
anything. So I think I to have find some other workaround for my 
software installation.

Anyways, thanks for the input.

What you need is Linux-Tiny kernel patches.
http://itmaze.com.au/articles/linux-tiny/

uCLinux is for arch's with no MMU. The small-footprint distro's are
good but I doubt they have kernel optimizations for size-reduction.

Look at the Linux-Tiny FAQ provided above. Get a kernel from
kernel.org and apply the tiny-patches to it. The last time I looked at
it, you could get a MMU-based kernel with TCP/IP for around 500KB.

I looked at it a long time back(1 year ago), things would have changed
now and you might need to do a bit of reading.

Choose keyboard Layout as "US" and Keyboard Rules as "xorg".

My xorg.conf has the following options under the keyboard section.

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Generic Keyboard"
        Driver          "kbd"
        Option          "CoreKeyboard"
        Option          "XkbRules"      "xorg"
        Option          "XkbModel"      "pc104"
        Option          "XkbLayout"     "us"

mmm... its not one that will say this is the final word for  this...

we are to discuss about such things in our weekly IRC meet (it happens in
Tamizh :-)) every saturday..

we have tamil wiktionary group, and we do discuss and express every other's
thought and pick the closet of the word recommended by many....

if we do not arrive at a a conclusion we stick to the word in english or
native language from it it originates... mostly english...but for little
course of time some one (it may even be u) turn up and suggest a better
word...

several words emanated the latest of the one being ??????? for library
(which confuses between collection of books & sub-programs), while in tamil
it gives clear meaning that it is intended to...

also forget that u know english while reading tamil translation....choose to
read the tamil version seperately and english version seperately (if
needed)..having got addicted to english volobulary of technical words it is
quite natural & understable to quote tamil equivalents as "convluted"..
every one of us came out of such a situtaion..

welcoming u to add wealth to tamizh vocabulary...

Check if Apache is up and running by opening up
http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1.

> But when the firefox page open, 

You have to put the file in /var/www/html, and open
http://localhost/yourpage.php

or set the DocmentRoot in Apache to where your file
is.

If someone can give a small write up as to how to make my machine to
recognize tamizh(both in linux and window env) it would be very useful.
Its boring to see the unrecognized characters for quite a long time.

As far as I remember, similar question has been asked many times in this 
list and solutions been offered. Please cultivate the habit of checking 
the mailing list archives for similar or related queries before posting 
a question.

Anyway, here is the solution if you want to just view Tamizh -

[1] System --> Settings --> Regional and Language

It will show you a list of languages, check whether you have Tamil in 
it. If not, then "add language" and select Tamil. It will install all 
support needed for Tamil language. When the installation is done, select 
the "Tamil" from list of languages available and add it to the default 
list. If needed, relogin.

[2] If you have problem in Tamil getting properly rendered in FireFox, 
please install 'language-pack-ta' (Am not sure of the package name for 
RH based distros)

* When I googled for 'getting tamil in linux', the 3 & 4 results were my 
own blog. I will again wrtie a new post for enabling Tamil support and 
scim in my blog, though already one exists for installing scim and 
trying in Tamil.

hmm ... you get a blank page and no 404 error, means file was found,
but might be that php interpreter didn't work through apache.

Check apache config fie (httpd.conf), that you have the mime correctly set
for .php files. Make sure you have the php module entry in httpd.conf.

LoadModule php5_module        modules/libphp5.so
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml

The php INSTALL file gives you all steps.

What do you get with this ? :

<html>
<body>
<?php
        print "This is inside php";
?>
        <br>This is outside php.
</body>
</html>

Also - everytime you make any change in apache config file, don't
forget to restart the server !

Hey Zico,
          Are you able to play audio in other formats (say
wav,ogg,system sounds etc.) If so problem is not with your audio driver.
Maybe you dont have mp3 codecs installed to playback files.
Install gstreamer-plugins-good/bad and ugly with all deps. then you will
be able to play back your audio. Most probably you have just ffmprg
and/or gstreamer-ffmpeg installed now. Xine also maybe having the same
problem. You may hav to install xine-extras to enable playback of mp3
audio and any other proprietary format.

Dear Zico,

if having problems with the server,

Try installing xampp from apachefriends and put your files in htdocs
folder, start the xampp server. I think this is one alter way by which
you could solve your problem. Keep us updated on your problem.

Being a tamilian, I have to oppose diluting SenTamizh. :-)
lovingly at least...

Lets remember, Tamil from times immemorial, (Before the stone and sand had
appeared...)...has always been used for poetic purposes.
It was basically suited for poetic and artistic purposes rather than
scientific.

Tamil does not have the depth or the range of sounds as is reqd for this.
Just going through the Hindi/kannada alphabets and this will prove it...
The lang has also not adapted/changed over a long time...
I sometimes get crosseyed just reading school level science books written
tamil.

So it is maybe time..(or was long since pending)..for Tamil++.
I guess Tamil puritans in this group will oppose this...

Friends.

I need help on web hosting.

I want to have some 5-10 websites.
one for my personal, one for linux, one for my classmate group, one for my
friend's personal, one for a startup etc.

I saw 1and1.com is giving 10GB space for around 3$ per month i.e Rs1800 per
year.

is that is a good one?

can i use that 10GB space for my 10 websites as 1GB per site?

I have to register 10 domain names seperately.

is 1and1.com is reliable?
is there any other reliable hosting service is there?

I am ready to pay around 2000 rs totally for that 10 sites per year.

Suggest me.

dear,
T.Shrinivasan.

If you believe everything you see on digg, slashdot etc, you'll probably

just to remind all that the chennaipy march meeting is on at MIT at 3  
pm. We will start our exploration into the guts of python - there are  
a few speakers fixed, but we expect more to give impromptu talks. We  
also hope to start planning for the ChennaiPyCon that we propose to  
hold shortly. Tea and biscuits provided - smoking allowed under the

if you want to host about 10 websites, there are two ways of going  
about it. 'el cheapo', paying around 2-3 k a year for php-mysql- 
cpanel stuff where you only have ftp access. Or going for the real  
thing, a vps hosting with about 10-20 gb of space and root access  
where you can do whatever you want, give your friends shell access,  
use languages like perl, python ruby, web frameworks like django,  
rubyonreals and generally have a ball. tektonic.net, for example,  
gives reliably vps for around 12 k a year. Of course, there is a lot  
of do it your self stuff there - but then thats where the fun comes in.

before eject the pen drive,close all applications the pen drive
used.Thenenter "sync" command will flush the file system
buffers.Then eject the pen drive will automatically power it off.If you were
transfered a bunch of files,this command will really work.

After you eject it,

Open, say, Nautilus, see if your pen drive icon
vanishes, or says not mounted?

Open a terminal and check output of df. See if you
still have an entry for your pen drive, maybe

it is unmounted and you can remove the device.

It will... in fact, remounting as read only will sync.. In fact what I
do in my system is remount as ro before unplugging and then pull it
out.. An udev script (I don't use HAL, never needed it..) mounts while
plugging and lazy unmounts it after I unplug the device...

non-FOSS way :
splashcast : You can combine audio/video/RSS-feeds and slideshows into
one meta-file which is hosted at splashcast.
http://splashcastmedia.com/

FOSS-way :
Try flumotion : Where you will setup a streaming server and play a
video file which would be a screencast created using wink(non-foss but
on linux) or istanbul (foss-gstreamer based). www.flumotion.net/ If
you feel flumotion is too much work VLC can also stream a video file.

VNC and X-forwarding have already been suggested so I won't go into
those details. I'm not sure it icecast can do video though.

If you are adventurous try Peercasting. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peercasting

I never meant to say chm format == pirated books. I meant "I have seen a 
lot of pirated books to be in chm format". If i make statement "i have 
seen a lot of pirated book as .pdf" it doesn't mean pdf is a platform 
for making pirated books.

Secondly. the books I meant are not just from M$ publications (if at all 
I have seen one like M$ publication) but from others like O'Reilly ( 
books which are not released by O'Reilly as free online ebook version).

Let me add others:

* Software Requirements by Karl E Wiegers
* Rapid Development by Steve McConnell
* Programming Windows by Charles Petzold

The last one has to be my favorite, and used to enjoy working through it
in college (didn't get too far, but that's another story). I think the
latest avatar uses C#, but the original was pure C - bare-metal
programming at it's best in windows (ahem, such a thing exists).

P.S: Interesting trivia - Petzold has a tattoo of Windows logo on his
arm - how's that for fanaticism ;-)

yes you can take. there are some extensions or function reference
available in PHP.

Following are few things which i know deals with languages
1. iconv
2. mbstring

the above deals with language interpretation. you can convert or
compare any characters in any encoding format.

Message-ID: <adc51dea0703180632m572acda3ld3c2d42a72dfcd3b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

Am re-opening the discussion on Internet Speed issues on Ubuntu Edgy.
The speed seems to suck on my Ubuntu Edgy laptop with 2.6.17-11 Edgy
Kernel. My Ethernet controller is

06:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.
RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 10)

which from the previous comment made by SRS seems to be some cheap
crap. Also I tried disabling ipv6 in the aliases file but not much
results.
As per Binand's suggestions here I give the output

RCV: 87380
SND: 16384

which is very similar to that of Mano's (OP of the previous thread)

I went through the syslog file to find any clue present there and
found that this message kept generating (and I feel that this might be
relevant)

Mar 18 12:35:09 edgy kernel: [17189842.056000] Disabling IRQ #169 quite often.

Also I face problem of disconnection every few minutes and
automatically gets reconnected after a minute or so.

Interesting part is that my other box which runs Windoze XP seems to
work just fine. Sometimes I dont even get the "Link" on my Linux box
and immediately during this time if I switch to Windoze it works fine.
I thought there might be some Hardware issue but, the same XP box also
has Ubuntu Edgy and I face a similar problem.

Any help/suggestions???

Reggies.

Based on my experience, syminet.com (aka. symonds.net) is really very
good. They offer wide range of services including enough webspace,
ssh, ftp, mysql, phpmyadmin, pop email accounts, squirrelmail, etc.
Not to mention the quality and support time around. They provide 24x7
support (not just in papers) which is not a common thing in any of
Indian based hosting providers. I've registered around 15 domains with
them in past couple of years and have no reason to look for an
alternative.

But I'm unsure if it will work within your budget. Given the amount of
domains you are going to host, i'm sure you may get a best deal from
them though. Good luck!

8139 is a commonly cloned and copied chipset and unless your chipset is
branded realtek, it might have a slightly different implementation .. so
that the standard realtek driver will suck at least slightly

Did you try the 8139too module? or the rtl8139 module? Try 8139too

Two modules 8139too and 8139cp are loaded. I am unsure about the
reason for this as AFAIK one of them should be sufficicent.

> What does cat /proc/interrupts say?  What's irq 169?

It says this
169:       1230   IO-APIC-level  yenta, tifm_7xx1, sdhci:slot0,
sdhci:slot1, sdhci:slot2, wmaster0

and it is because of a new PCMCIA Wireless Adapter that I fixed in to
replace my crappy Broadcom 4318 in-built one. :-) Sorry for the
misleading info I provided. Or hold on.. Is it because of too many
network devices enabled??? (I feel this question is stupid but yet...
)

I had a custom compiled Linux 2.6.20-1 and when run that, the internet
seems to work just fine. Seems like some issue with the edgy kernel
IMO.

That's for your PCMCIA card.  If its crappy .. get rid of it and see if
it works for you.  Nothing wrong with broadcom - 2.6.17 (which you get
in edgy) and up should have pretty decent support for broadcom wifi.

Looks a bit unrelated to your 8139 issues. Just for kicks poke through
the rtl8139 and 8139too module source and see all the sarcastic things
Donald Becker has to say about realtek ..

Make sure you have it on full duplex - if you autonegotiate it it may go
to half duplex, which on an older (10 mbps) hub, can give you real slow
speeds.  Try using a switch instead of a hub and see if that helps.

me up the other day and was totally happy about the installation and
about linux. I think we have a new convert :). Thank you Shrini for

Shutting down and restarting the NIC after the system comes up solved the
problem for me. So now I have this in my rc.local. An unexciting solution
:-) but did you try this?

 Hi All,

We have a set of non-computer sceince/non programmer friends  who wants
to be introduced to Linux.

Actually these guys are very inspired by the democratic aspects of
gnu/linux.

I am looking for a presentation /base material which we can build on
for the 1 day workshop.

Many of you have done sessions so thought it would be good to build on
it.

Find details below.

Regards
Senthil

Following is the cirteria::

A) keep it at user level - don't scare people away
   don't bore people 
   show interesting applications
   make sure they can boot up - do basic things like - office , browsing
and mails, new software installation
   brief session on philosophy - with web links

B) rough session plan
		
	installation - maybe we should do this at the last
	playing around and introducing  edubuntu - educational software
      showing how we can type mails etc in regional languages 
	web-browsing - email - chat 
	installing new applications
	gimp
      playing music - internet radio - internet chess  and videos

IMHO, please dont bore then with slides and there is no use in showing 
one if the numbers are very limited. Rather start with a basic talk 
about what FOSS and GNU/Linux is and whats all about the philosophy.

Then move to the installation session, do a dual boot with other OS. 
Just show them that the installation is not a problem at all. Just 
mention the two steps they have to take care: [1] partitioning and [2] 
installation of grub.

If feasible have an hands on session of installation, immediately after 
the above. That will increase their confidence of installing and trying 
out Linux.

Once installation is done, use the same system to show them around the 
desktop and what are the applications available by default. If you had 
them have an hands on installation then this session can be really 
interactive and live.

If possible to connect to internet, show them the browsers, mail 
clients, messengers and if they are interested the IRC clients as well.

If they want to play multimedia, show them video and audio players. Tell 
them about prop formats and why they are not supported by default.

If internet is available, show them how to install a software package 
using the distribution's packet manager.

Think this is enough for a good start and they can learn more as they 
become comfortable with their new OS. We do have a presentation which we 
use if for workshops in colleges, but its one and half hour of theory, 
story and philosophy which can not really make people adopt GNU/Linux 
until it is followed by an installation session and hands on feel 
themselves.

Does not solve the problem. And I feel that this is not an unexciting
solution but also _not_ a solution at all. I wonder how it works just
by shutting down the NIC and restarting it :-) Strange!!!

Yeah, but, did you update the entries in the

Do an install fest - find a place that has 15..20 throwaway PCs, and get
a set of fedora, ubuntu, debian etc CDs, and spare monitors, kbds etc -
they can bring their CPU over.

also demo installing other stuff for people who are interested, "cute"
demos like glade, mono, gimp effects etc so people can have fun

Have lots of eye candy available from kde-look.org etc

Friends.

Me and my friend Thanigairajan went to Mr.Thomas's Home on last saturday.
I wondered him as being a pretty aged man, he showed a lot of interest in 
linux. I hope anoop moved him.

Well. I installed Kubuntu 6.10. The process is so easy,
But the airtel broadband took 1.5 hrs to configure.

The support is nice but whrn we tell about linux, they keep on forwarding to 
another person. They made a circle on forwardign.

Atlast, i enquired them to tell on windows.
They told.

I stored the username and password in the router itself.
Viola. It worked well.

After updating the essential multimedia packages, games,  codecs.
we came with satisfaction.
Thomos also felt satisfied wth linux.

Let us hope he keep on living with linux.

dear,
T.Shrinivasan.

These presentations will be used for the followups.

What we do noramally is 

1. we conduct demo day
2. people see it
3. The go home and try
4. they have some problem
5. they ask luggies
6. mostly we dont answer it, but we comment the questions a lot.
7. the newbie gets frustated
8. some of us suggest them to read man pages, tldp.org etc
9. they try it and get more frustated.
10. they giveup
11. they keep telling that linux is tough than windows.

So, we have to give the same concentration for the followup.
we have to prepare study materials for newbies.
not big howtos, guides.

These meterials should have a lot of pictures.
Just for newbies.

They can read presentations, not huge guides.

In chennailug, someone may have linux presentations.
some may gave corporate taining.

They can share the presentation materials with us.

Thank you.

dear,
T.Shrinivasan.

This is SOP for contacting any ISP. Do not talk about Linux. Just note
all the settings that they ask you to do and then use them
intelligently and you are done.

It was nice for you to take the trouble. Unfortunately it is not
always possible and hence need to have lot of install fests (the other
concurrent thread talks about this) even though we may end up just
doing repeats.

 New York City Hackers, The Code Linux are other good ones that I've seen.
These movies are available on torrents and various P2P networks. As these
are Creative commons licensed, you can download them from these networks
legally.

Code linux is also available on Google videos
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3498228245415745977
New york city hackers also seems to be available,
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8378101651263635398
but it says that its a 30 mins video, whereas i remember seeing it as a
50mins video when i downloaded from a torrent. So, not sure if it is the
full version of it.

Hello :)

In the last few days I tried some softwares which I would like to share.

1.I used Quantaplus to develop some HTML pages.Quanta handbook gives good
lessons on PHP,JavaScript,HTML and CSS.Initially I ad problem in editing
previously created pages.But making new pages is a very smooth
process.Butstill you have to open a browse to see the created page :(

2.I made a QT application using Qtdesigner.QtAssistant is unparrallel. I
made few simple applications. Never thought that C++ is so powerful :o

3. Mostly I use Xpdf and Adobe pdf viewer to view pdf files. But every one
should try Kpdf.Why?? Because it uses kttsmgr(A text to speech converter) I
did a lot of experiments with it ;)

4. I played Solar Wolf for more than 2 hours continuously :)

I am trying to find a tool to develop applications using curses library.

Without the rc.local entries that does the shutting down and restarting of
the NIC and all other things being equal, even now I have the same problems
I reported in my original thread. With the entries in rc.local I get the
speed normally seen in BSNL broadband (50KBps to 100KBps and sometimes even
250-300KBps).

So, if you are bothered about the semantics of the word you can use
something else but the fact remains that it solves my problem! While it
solves my problem, it obviously is setting something else in motion which
actually is removing the root cause. My post regarding this in the Ubuntu
forum had a response (which I forget now - I think I linked it in my
original post) which might lead you on to the root cause.

Try this as you may have more than one running,
> sudo poff -a && sudo pon dsl-provider


I did not follow up with that because my problem disappeared after
implementing the non-solution :-)

I take it you are trying to get the user to change CD's at this point ? 
you missed my bit in one of the previous emails when I said you should 
put you rpms on the installer CD so you wont need to do this. if you 
need to change CD's - you need to recode your stuff so the installer 
knows howto handle this.

And to be honest, I'd need to be very drunk ( unlikely ) or paid a fair 
bit of money to go back and look at anaconda code from rh9. Also, I have 
issues about working on something with such massive security issues now.

you are trying to solve the wrong problem, what you are creating for 
yourself is more issues and more breakage.

Hi all,

could not get webcam working with ekiga. 
I have compiled and modprobed driver r5u870 which is known to work 
with HP Pavillion webcam on  Ubuntu (2.6.17.11).
but i donot see udev creating /dev/video0 files automatically
I have tried checking with xawtv too which  spewed:


This is xawtv-3.95, running on Linux/i686 (2.6.17-11-generic)
can't open /dev/video0: No such file or directory
v4l-conf had some trouble, trying to continue anyway

Well, did you add "load v4l" in your xf86/xorg config?

This is how I configured my webcam.

As a matter of fact, i have done the very thing some time back. but that 
seemed too much of a trouble for a simple problem, and that's why i was 
trying to find an alternative. As i could not find a better solution, i 
guess I have to live with this.

Anyways, thanks for the reply.

hardware is back up and running and the initial sync is in progress. 
unfortunately, we lost about 250 gb of stuff (not because of the hardware 
failure but because of subsequent 'human error'!) - so it will take a few 
days atleast to get fully populated and operational.

Guys,

I am looking for a LAMP based web application for betting. Aim is to
host a such a portal for a group of friends of mine for the cricket world cup.
People can register, view the matches scheduled and place their bet
on a team. (All for fun, no money ok! Now don't run to the police!)

There are a lot of such applications out there in Sourceforge. But if
any of you have tried any such thing and would recommend, that would
save my time trying them.

Minimalistic, simple interface, not feature bloated, easy to setup ...

Dear luggies,

  I,Parthan and Harish did one day seminar on introduction to FOSS at
Srinivasa Institute of Engg and Technology, Poonamalle. We did
installation, basic guis, and development using glade and
qt-designer. We also talked about doing projects in FOSS. The campus
FOSS club was also inaugurated on that day. The students were good. 

On behalf of ILUGC I thank the management and HODs of CS and IT
departments for the opportunity. I also thank Prof.Kumaran of Jaya
Engg College who was instrumental in arranging this seminar. 

Hope to see many student taking interest in FOSS.

Try installing the meta-package ubuntu-desktop or gnome-desktop if the
linux-mint uses different repositories..You should have all the default
packages...

I don't think they can meet the deadline. Right now there are 66 RC bugs 
as opposed to the planned 20. May be 1 or 2 more weeks. Even then Etch 
would be delayed by only 5 months which is not that bad.

for a testing user, freezes are those mildly annoying phases where
updates slow down and aptitude starts giving zero upgrades on a daily
refresh... hope they get over it soon :p

it moves on...

After installing the mysql client to ur system you can find the
libmysqlclient.so file in /lib/mysql.   Just add that to the  library path
and you ll get it working.
ie., ur compilation command should something like this:
g++ -I /include/mysql -L /lib/mysql  -c<your C file name>
I think this ll help you.

In my opinion redhat 9 is poor performance wise. Bettter avoid it.

Since you have celeron with 256mb on celeron, better try fc2 or fc3
or debian sarge. You can use recent distributions if you use
alternative desktops like xfce,windowmaker comfortably. 

To cut unnecessary services look at system service in guiand remove
what is not needed. Or remove unwanted services from appropriate 
/etc/rc?d  directory [do this only when you know what it is else
better use gui tools under kde/gnome].

You cannot get RHEL this way you have to buy it from RedHat visit here
if you want to buy http://in.redhat.com/rhel also look at CentOS
(www.centos.org) this is a free clone of RHEL which can be obtained
for free

avoid RH9 and RHEL.

Go for lightweight X window systems.
like windowmaker,fvwm,icewm,xfce,twm etc.

This month LFY comes with the Slackware11 DVD.
get it and install it.

Slackware is the best for even very low end systems.

Do an `svn export` and then jar it.

You can use zip(1).  The zip tool has a "-x" option IIRC which can be 
used exclude file patterns when archiving.

Ask for an ethernet based dsl router and you should be fine

I've been using tata indicom (earlier, they were dishnet) for 5 years
now, not that many hassles, touch wood.

Hello ppl,

                  I have installed ubuntu 6.0.2 TLS version recently in my
system.Iam using the Gnome desktop enviroment.
In gnome there is an option System->Administartion->Users and
Groups.Inthat,there is an option to change wat administarative tasks
an user can
perform. I removed some of the permissions like access to Users and Groups.
What generally happens when i choose System->Administration->Users and
Groups is , the root password is asked for and then tasks like
adduser,delete user can be done.
Since i removed user access to these i dont get the option
System->Administration->User and Groups.Now i want it back.How can i do
tat??It would  be better if i could login as root..Is there anyway to login
as root without using any options under System->Administration.


Thanks.
Charanya.

In Ubuntu, the first user is given the administrator privileges to do 
installation and other administration work, but this account is not 
equal to a root user account. The root user account is disabled by default.

$ sudo passwrd

If it asks for a password - first, type your current user password
Then it will ask to enter the new Unix password, enter the password for 
'root' and again renter it when it asks.

Now you have the root user account enabled. Login as root and add back 
the administrative privilege to your current user account.

** Remember not to use the root user account frequently. Use 'sudo 
<command>' to execute the command with admin privileges **

HTH :)

Dear Ilugies

The present it setup in my company is I have a windows 2000 server , an
email server which also acts as a proxy server(using linux). I am planning
to add one more machine( which will also run on linux) purely for browsing
purpose. What I would like to know is that Is there any way where i can
prevent a person accessing my windows 2000 server and machines which are
running on the windows network from the linux machine(the browsing machine).

Thanks & Regards

Put it on an entirely different network segment and block access to it.
Or put it on a different internet connection altogether

I know this is not what OP asked for but Ubuntu's philosophy of not
having root login is rather neat. You can always drop in to root with
" sudo su - " using your password if you have admin rights. This
method also records who did become root when etc. Mostly it is just a
question of adapting your thinking and running one command at a time
with " sudo comand " or series of commands with " sudo su - "

And you can always add people in to admin group.

I suppose the OP mentioned that she has removed the 'admin' privilege on 
her account in the 'Manage User and Groups' panel. Hence, she might not 
have administrative privileges to do a "sudo su -", if am not wrong. 
That is why I suggested on enabling the root user account, as she might 
not be having the admin privileges for her current account. So she can 
not add a administrator privilege to any new user account she creates.

I am myself a strong advocate of no-root-user-login, but when she has 
disabled the admin rights on her first account, am afraid there is not 
much way out than enabling the root account and getting back those 
privileges for the user account of hers'. If there is an alternative 
way, other than enabling the root account, I strongly suggest that :)

You know, after reading that message, I'm having doubts about my
connection too. I use Edgy, and mine is an Airtel 256kbps connection,
can't complain about the speed - it's always been decent. But the "link"
LED on the router/adsl modem (Beetel 220BX) keeps going down quite
often. Strange thing is, it's completely random. I don't have any
problems for a couple of days, and the third day the link keeps going down.

I thought it must be some problem with the ISP itself and I reported
this to the Airtel people, but they seem to be going in circles about
where the problem is. Does this sound familiar to any Airtel users here?
I implemented mano's solution, but that doesn't seem to fix it. Any ideas?

TIA,
V.

It is very difficult to find out the problem from the panic dump. If
you have ksymoops tool, use it to get more debug info about the error.

Or Post in redhat support list.

You mean in numbers ? :0 If you take students in MIT, a lot of them do 
use FOSS Tools.

There are indeed a lot of students who wish to have FOSS Tools as a part 
of their curriculum. I have seen a lot of students having interest in Qt 
tool kit. And I know students who did a good work with Blender.

Rather, we all want "programming" to be thought than any or few specific 
"programming tool". Teach them C, its their choice to use gcc or Turbo C.

> 2.wanted to join a existing FOSS project?

A lot of students are indeed interested to do projects in FOSS, they 
just don't know how as their teachers have no clue of them.

> 3.  wanted to contribute to projects by translation and documentation?

I am not much sure about translation, but if the students have good 
linguistic ability then they will be mostly interested to do 
documentation apart from contributing code.

Subject: [Ilugc] Pakistan Offers Open Source Training Toolkit
Message-ID: <200703221929.27248.tshrinivasan@gmail.com>

Pakistan is the third largest low-cost IT-enabled and offshore business 
processes outsourcing services provider in Asia after India and China. The 
country?s Open Source Resource Center (OSRC), a project of Pakistan?s 
Ministry of Information Technology, has developed and released a FOSS 
resource kit entitled ?OSS Training Toolkit,? originally put together in 
order to facilitate OSRC?s own training workshops in Pakistan. The toolkit 
contains step-by-step manuals in six modules covering various Free and Open 
Source Software applications. All the content is available in printed manual 
form and as OpenDocument (.odt), Portable Document Format (.pdf), and 
Microsoft Word (.doc) files for download.The toolkit covers databases, 
application servers, desktop applications, office productivity suites, 
enterprise resource planning (ERP), and customer relationship management 
(CRM) software, as well as open source desktop applications for both Linux 
and Microsoft Windows. Along with the manuals, the toolkit provides a set of 
CDs that includes two Linux distributions, Ubuntu Linux Desktop and Fedora 
Server, as well as the other applications.

The toolkit?s curriculum has been planned and laid out in such a manner that 
anyone from a basic to novice user can learn and benefit from it. It has been 
released under open source licenses through the OSRC Web site so that 
individuals and organizations interested in migrating from proprietary to 
open source networks can freely download, distribute, use, and modify the 
toolkit and its related CDs. - Fouad Riaz Bajwa

Dear ilugc friends,

I am trying to configure postfix for smtp relaying in RHEL4 Update2,
I am getting the error SASL Authentication failure message from the relay
server.
But the same configuration works with RHEL4 AS .

my main.cf looks like
relayhost = mail.myrelaysrv.com
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_security_options =

am i missing anything ?

please provide my any point to resolve this issue.

Thanks & Regards

Is postfix compiled with sasl libs?
Are the sasl rpms installed?

postconf -n

and then what error do you get when you try to auth on postfix?

Does your postfix advertise something like

AUTH PLAIN LOGIN

when you telnet to port 25 of your server and issue something like EHLO
test?

telnet your.server 25
[you get a smtp prompt]
EHLO test.example.com
[you get some stuff back]
QUIT

Do that. Then paste the results. Then try to send smtp auth'd email
through your server, check what is logged in /var/log/maillog

An interesting thread on fedora-devel, Eric announcing his concerns with
Fedora's path. Some good points about package management system as well.
A bit old though!

	March 24, 2007
Message-ID: <450379.17600.qm@web50212.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I conducted couple of sessions for the ECE, EEE and
EIE department students of Jaya Engineering College,
Thiruninravur, Tamil Nadu, today, Saturday, March 24,
2007.

I would like to thank Prof. Kumaran for his continued
support. Special thanks also to Harish for
coordinating and organizing the event.

I started off with an introduction to Free/Libre/Open
Source Software, taught them examples of Alliance VLSI
CAD tools, and embedded GNU/Linux HOWTO [1]. I gave a
demo of an embedded development kit. 

After the sessions, we had an informal discussion with
the faculty of EEE, EIE.  As such, they are kept
occupied with teaching classes ("theory") round the
clock, correcting assignments, unit tests, exams etc.
I emphasized that this isn't going to take them or the
students any further, in productive "learning", and
compared their work to what their counterparts were
doing in Universities abroad. If time permits, they
said they can work on FLOSS. But, thanks to Prof.
Kumaran's efforts, the team is growing.

After lunch, we had an informal discussion with few
students in the FOSS lab about their final year
project work. Most of them knew only about Java, as
that was what was "prescribed" in the syllabus. But, I
gave them an insight on the different domains that
they could work on, and possibilities available in the
Industry. Their total lack of exposure was obvious,
but, once they hear a lot about FOSS in the industry,
they are quite eager to know more.

The FOSS lab is running Red Hat 9. The systems have
256 MB RAM, so, I asked them to upgrade to a recent
distro ASAP. They also are in the process of moving to
PHP, mysql for their website [2] , which is not
designed or currently maintained. They agreed.

Server has been obtained from our good friends at
deeproot [3], so they can try to setup an internal
portal (PHP, mysql) for intra-department
communication, data handling.

It was here that I met the "Revmakx" [4]. Atleast,
that's what these four students call themselves. They
are awesome PHP, mysql guys. To do classic PHP, mysql
websites for clients (international, and local) at
this age, they are my ideal FOSS students.

The system administrator in the lab wanted few tips on
networking with Red Hat. I showed him how to use scp
to transfer files between two Red Hat systems. He was
so happy! During summer holidays, Prof. Kumaran wants
to do some FOSS camp for the staff. Should be fun, if
you guys can help out, and if you are in town.

I've already been there couple of times, so, didn't
take any photographs.

Sorry for the long e-mail, just wanted to make sure
that I covered everything.

Regards,

SK

Subject: [Ilugc] BMS College of Engineering - Installation and
	Troubleshooting Session
Message-ID: <adc51dea0703241117i147d35e9i8684a0379264f1b0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Praveen (http://pravi.co.nr) and myself have been working with the BMS
College of Engineering (http://www.bmsce.ac.in/) folks for around 6
months now and things are beginning to show results. Hats Off to the
students!

Today we were there for a Installation and Troubleshooting session.
The session was attended by around 50 - 60 students in one of the CS
Labs. After briefing the FLOSS Philosophy and pros/cons of proprietary
software to (new)students (How FLOSS could help in Knowledge
acquisition) , the installation session began. We had asked the BMS
LUG folks to handle it and they did it quite well. Installed Fedora,
Debian and Ubuntu on around 6 boxes that were offered by the BMS
College Management.

A lot of doubts were cleared in the discusions that followed with
active participation from the students themselves (not only asking
questions but answering questions posted by their peers)

Whats astounding is these events are now being organised by second
year students after some nice work/motivation from the current final
years. They have already quite a few sessions planned up and also a
major Awareness campaign around end of April for Bangalore Colleges.

Also there are now atleast 8 SoC project Applications going out from
this college after some morale boosting sessions which Praveen, Akshay
(BMS Final Year), Srikanth and myself had with these folks a couple of
weeks before.

Happy to see the BMS LUG begining to ROCK!! Keep Rolling mates! And
the end feedback was that the students asked for more such informative
sessions. Nice to hear this!

OT: BMS College has a Mountaineering Club!!! They do rock climbing,
mini bungee jumping and stuff during the weekends! Surprised me!!

Reggies.

Message-ID: <6279594c0703251203l344e2ca1g14490ce4236a9716@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
       I am managing a server in BITS Pilani and am running into a
strange problem. We are using Red Hat Linux 9 (2.4.20-8 smp). The
problem is that one particular user group is able to telnet while the
other is not. The server closes the connection abruptly for them as
soon as they log on. The /var/log/messages file shows the following:

Mar 25 12:48:53 prithvi telnetd[5031]: ttloop: peer died: EOF
Mar 25 15:10:36 prithvi telnetd[7633]: ttloop: peer died: EOF
Mar 25 15:21:07 prithvi telnetd[7843]: ttloop: peer died: EOF
Mar 25 15:22:56 prithvi telnetd[7905]: ttloop: peer died: EOF
Mar 25 15:47:25 prithvi telnetd[8360]: ttloop: peer died: EOF
Mar 25 15:47:30 prithvi telnetd[8361]: ttloop: peer died: EOF
Mar 25 16:54:10 prithvi telnetd[9518]: ttloop: peer died: EOF
Mar 25 17:08:40 prithvi telnetd[9898]: ttloop: peer died: EOF
Mar 25 17:14:57 prithvi telnetd[9991]: ttloop: peer died: EOF
Mar 25 17:35:22 prithvi telnetd[10489]: ttloop: peer died: EOF
Mar 25 18:29:56 prithvi telnetd[11537]: ttloop: peer died: EOF

The other user group however is able to telnet fine. One interesting
point is that all are able to ssh, ftp etc. properly. Further this
problem occurs only if telnet is started via xinetd. If I start
telnetd (telnetd -a off -debug)manually, after stopping xinetd; in
debugging mode, then all are able to telnet fine with no errors
reported. What could be the problem?

The contents of /etc/xinetd.d/telnet file are

# default: on
# description: The telnet server serves telnet sessions; it uses \
#       unencrypted username/password pairs for authentication.
service telnet
{
        disable = no
        flags           = REUSE
        socket_type     = stream
        wait            = no
        user            = root
        server          = /usr/sbin/in.telnetd
        log_on_failure  += USERID
}

The installed packages are as follows
telnet-server-0.17-25.1.legacy
telnet-0.17-25.1.legacy
xinetd-2.3.11-1.9.0

Please help me ASAP as the server is being used for a mission critical
purpose here.

Preetish

from your last post, I assume you are using Ubuntu. Then do open a 
terminal and do "sudo pppoeconf". It will ask you a few questions like 
what is the username, password, etc. Answer them and its done.

You can select auto-connect during booting or use "sudo pon 
dsl-provider" to connect. Use "sudo poff -a" to disconnect.

1. Run pppoeconf as root user
2. The username and password will be asked in the interactive setup
that will follow
3. To connect to the internet type.
             sudo pon dsl-provider

4. Disconnect
              sudo poff  -a

HTH.

Theres another way in which we can connect to the net while the system
initializes its network configuration during the bootup

GUI:
In the Administration > networking..select static
Give the machine ip: 192.168.1.x, where x!=1
Gateway address: 192.168.1.1
and in /etc/resolv.conf add
nameserver 4.2.2.1

Good Ol' Shell:
ifconfig eth0 up 192.168.1.2
route add default gw 192.168.1.1
and entries in the resolv.conf as mentioned above.

To check if it all worked...Open 192.168.1.1 in your browser wherin you
would be greeted by the admin interface of the modem..
Hint: You can enable dhcp from the gateway interface as well

IMO, i feel this is more work but still it doesnt need the pppoeconf
package to be installed, which is the case in some distros..

When configuring using pppoeconf, it asks a set of questions. One among 
them is "Whether to connect to the internet when you turn on your system 
?" If answered yes, then it connects every time you turn on your computer.

Airtel Broadband is dead simple to configure. No pon , poff nothing.

Just go to System -> Administration -> Networking -> WiredConection
properties -> Select DHCP and re-activate the connection.

Voila you are up and running!

After I left, he rebooted and said it wasn't connecting.

Hi all

        In my ealier mail i had told about a usergroup not able to
telnet the server but able to ssh or ftp to it . I have some more
information regarding it which i think may help. I have seen that if i
change the GID of the group then the users of that perticular group
are able to telnet to it . However there are 6 such groups and about
800 users per group .Is there a possibility that the GID may be
creating a problem though i have not made any changes to it .

i am having the problem that it doesnt reconnect when the connection  
goes down. Each time the connection goes down we have to use  
pppoeconf again

same here with bsnl. running pppoeconf every 5-10 minutes is uncool.  
Previously when using mandrake, pppd would continously try to  
reconnect whenever it went down, so browsing was not affected

So's the case with BSNL!

The h/w box that BSNL provides is not just a modem. It can be configured as
a router that automatically logs on to the BSNL account. It is also a DHCP
server which can dish out network parameters.

Open 192.168.1.1 (the routers ip address) in your browser and type 'admin',
'admin' for username and password, you will see the configuration interface.
You can type in your BSNL account username and password in one of the
screens and have it automatically log on!

I have never done the pon poff stuff in the last 2 years I've been having a
BSNL connection. It just works!

I hope, it is not possible. Bcoz, you are not directly connected to
the others computer. The intermediate server will maintain the
chatting sessions.

But you can capture the packets in ethereal and If you know the packet
format, try to analyze.

Eventhough you packetsniffing you will not get the original ip since the
server is acting as a gateway... So you will get the ip address of the
server only not the other peer. For that purpose you have to make a peer to
peer connection to the another end. Example file transfer.

So you people mean to say we can connect with two ways

   1. Connect using ADSL Router (Connect the phone cable from ADSL
   Splitter to ADSL Router (given by BSNL) and then ethernet cable to Machine)
   2. Use Linux as a ADSL Router itself (Connect Phone cable from ADSL
   Splitter to Internal Modem in the M/C) : Is this valid?

Yes.

No. The internal modem cannot speak pppoe! The second way is to connect
your linux box to  the router/modem using the USB cable that comes along
with it.

Thats only the physical connection part. Establishing the data-link
connection can be done on the linux box or the router! I'm using the router
for this. Am on shaky territory here :-) so use my info with caution!

There are two ways your modem/router functions, ........... as an
pppoe router or a bridge.

pppoe router :
Configure your computer as just another machine on the same network
that your rouer is in.
If your router ip address is 192.168.1.1(default) , your machine can
have 192.168.1.2 and gateway 192.168.1.1.Ofcourse you can even ask
your router o act as dhcp and avoid this.
User name and password are stord by the router
You need a mechanism for dns . Generally your router can forward dns
for you.else you can run pdnsd or somthing similar and set resolv.conf
approproiately.Your run your own set it as 192.168.1.2(ur comp) router
forwards set it as 192.168.1.1.
All such settings can be changed by going to the page http://192.168.1.1

Bridge:
When you router is in bridge, you dial from the OS to the router  and
supply the user name and password at that time , the router then makes
the connection and something like a bridge is formed between your
computer and the router.i.e two connections are merged into one.

Suggestions : If you have ethernet enabled modem , use the first
method , you get connected when you switch on the modem and there is 0
configuration.If your router is configured for windows or linux you
can simply restart to another OS and its bound to work , ofcourse  you
must set the same ip range.
If you just have a USB connection , go for the second method as thats
the only option.

Friends.

My Friend is preparing for IAS Exams.

He wants a knowledge Management System.

He highly satisfied on this.

So he wants a own copy of wikipedia for offline reading.

How to download it fully.

If anyone have, please give to us.

Thanks,

Dear Shrinivasan,

Check this www.webaroo.com and select the necessary webpack.

Hope this solves your friend's problem.

Your friend will have to be very rich first :-) He will have to build (or
buy) an entire data center  with many terrabytes of storage and incur
gigabytes in bandwidth costs! As Ravi Kumar has pointed out webaroo offers
this kind of service but do not know how viable it is!

But if your friend is preparing for IAS, what stops him from having an
always on broadband connection!!

Actually, a snapshot of wikipedia with no history, no users etc, just
articles and categories is not that bad.. you can have it running on a
decent home PC..  I do agree with the second point that spending Rs. 300 per
month on a broadband connection is a better option (if it is available where
the guy/gal) stays..

Router and bridge are different. Don't mix and match.

The Huawei MT841 provided by BSNL can be operated in
bridge mode as follows:

Login to the web interface of the box, go to
Basic->Connections.

Remove any existing PVC-6 entry. 

Create a new "Bridge" entry with VPI set to 0, and VCI
set to 35. Check on "LLC" for Encap. Click "Apply".
Click "Save All". 

After the box reboots, you can connect any PC to the
ethernet port of the bridge, and use pppoeconf on the
PC to dial, and connect to the ISP.

he wants malayala manorama and competition success review rather than

Webaroo was giving out DVDs of their software with a dump of wikipedia
bundled in at Barcamp Mumbai last summer.

I have a copy of said DVD, and I am currently in Madras. If anyone
wants a copy, please contact me offline, and we can figure out how to
get one across to you.

No I ain't mix and matching.
It is possible for the same device to operate in both modes.
At least mine provided by airtel can.
And I have mentioned both the modes so that there is a choice for the
reader to select from the two.
And each mode has been separately mentioned.

What do you mean by access ?
access as in configure your domain controller and active directory
take care of it.
access as in not acting as nat , set up firewall .
What exactly do you mean by access is important to know :)

There you go....  /etc/init.d/sshd  comes with the openssh-server package.
So, you need to install it  to have ssh service.

You can login as root without password using single user mode.  
http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-7.3-Manual/custom-guide/s1-rescuemode-booting-single.html
http://www.faqs.org/docs/linux_admin/x2179.html

I guess you know your root password, If so just logout from X, and login
again as root.

This command should tell you where you share object file is. 
$locate libmysqlclient.so 

Once you find the folder which has libmysqlclient.so, then 
$g++ -I /include/mysql -L <folder containing libmysqlclient.so>  -c<your
C file name>


If you do not have libmysqlclient.so, then you need to install mysql
package. 
"$yum install mysql"  should help

The /usr/include/mysql  files and libmysqlclient.so  comes with mysql-devel
rpm  (in fedora).  You can check if the package is installed using:
rpm -q mysql-devel

So, the above g++ command would become :
g++ -I/usr/include/mysql -lmysqlclient     ....  .

   Dear Friends,

    
   I have tried a small perl script and tried in my server.
    
   The following things I have checked with my server.
    
   1. The server is installed with

    PERL version     5.8.7                 

    
   2. I tried the perl script as follows
    
   www.rajaramsystems.com/scgi-bin/mytest.pl
    
   3. I have 777 permission for both the file and the folder.
    
   But I am getting the following error.
   The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was
   unable to complete your request.
    
   Can I anyone point out the mistake of me
    
   Regds,
    
   L.Ramkumar.
    
    
   The Script I have executed is as follows :
    
   #!/usr/bin/perl
   #
   # ===========
   # helloworld.pl
   # ===========
   #
   print "content-type:text/html\n\n";
   print "<html>\n";
   print "<head>\n";
   print "<title>Hello World</title>\n";
   print "</head>\n";
   print "<body>\n";
   print "<b>Hello World!</b><br>\n";
   print "</body>\n";
   print "</html>\n";

Try:
#!/usr/bin/perl -wT

Also check the Perl modules installed.

Hello frends!

	My configs are , ACER Aspire 1640 Laptop,  OpenSuse 10.2...

While working today, After few minutes suddenly all the applications get hang 

and it reports that  filesystem is readonly.

At the time , /var/log/messages shows some reiserfs problem.

What it means? hard disk problem? 

(After restarting the system , i cant see that messages in log file... Thats 

why i cant put that log here)

Regards,

Balavignesh

Look at the webserver error log. Actual cause for the error will be
there.

[1] What does /va/log/apache(or httpd)/error.log say ?

[2] Where have you kept this file ?

[3] Have you given the permission in your httpd.conf or apache.conf to 
execute CGI perl files ?

[4] Never give 777 permission, use 755.

[5] Internal server error also occurs due to problem in the script. 
Error message in the logs is what we need to see first.

[6] Do you have mod_perl installed ?

Classic case of filesystem inconsistency... Get to single user mode
and run fsck... If possible, back up all data before doing so...

it moves on...

Dear Suresh,
It worked when i updated the postfix & openssl packages with the latest ones
from redhat. But I was not able to identify what the actual problem was.
Thank you for the help in solving the problem .

I'm evaluating Asterisk/TrixBox for my organization. I have very
limited knowledge in these topic.
My goals are,
to have regular analog phone for each employee,
local outbound calls through 3 or 4 BSNL/Airtel PSTN lines,
international outbound calls through couple of Gizmo/SIP accounts.

Is it possible and if possible how should I approach this and what all
hardware I might require.
*Again I have a very limited knowledge in this so please elaborate you
guidance.*

Hello,

I need 16 bit processor in terms of open hardware (all ofits specifications
should be known) Can NRCFOSS help me in finding open hardwares? An article
about free hardware can be found at "
http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=1999-06-22-005-05-NW-LF".RMS
has also written about free hardware in his essays under "Secret Hardware".

How can we calculate the efficiency(memory usage, compilation time etc..) of
a C program using GCC?

Is there any online tutorial for Qt? I am having trouble in the data types

BSNL gives two types of modems. One is a modem router and the other is
a simple dsl modem. If you have the simple dsl modem then all you have
to do is set up the connection using pppoeconf and then configure to
run "pon <connection name>" when the user logs in or just create a
shortcut on desktop to run a script to run "pon <connection name>".
If you have a modem router then all you have to do is connect to the
router using a browser (http://192.168.1.1 - typically, username
admin, password admin - check the manual for the router to be sure)
and then enter the ISP username and password in the wan configuration
page and you would have an fulltime connected system

Message-ID: <406f1f3f0703290716h3a648dfejacb9ec06a80ef6d2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everybody,
We had a discussion in this group some time back regarding internal
modems that are supported in linux. I have found an internal modem
that is supported in linux. The WeP (wipro e-peripherals) Spider 56K
V.92 PCI Modem with the Conexant HSFi CX11252-412 0610y1DB chipset
(PCI ID 14F1:2F30) is supported in linux and it costs only around Rs.
375. The driver from linuxant.com can be installed very easily using
their installer. After some minor settings - username, password, phone
- in wvdial you are ready to go. Only thing is that the speed is
limited to 14kbps for the free version of the driver. The paid version
goes at 20$. I will keep on the lookout for more internal modems that
are supported in linux.
Cheers

Try Trolltech's website. http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt

You can try the documentation site: http://doc.trolltech.com/4.2/

Talking about QT licenses, a lot of people don't seem to understand how it
works and so a small writeup is includede below. Admittedly this is some
what offtopic, but in a sense it does focus a bit on opensource
development.. so I state it here.

Here goes:

Please note that the QT license is different from most open source
licenses. Qt comes under a dual licensing policy. Qt Opensource licensing
is available free for opensource development, and Qt commercial licensing
is available for commercial development.

Important:

a) You cannot start developing your product using the QT Opensource
license and then make your product a proprietary product by purchasing a
QT Commercial license later on. Once you have developed code using QT Open
Source license, it will have to remain perpetually under that license.

b) If you decide to purchase QT Commercial license, it is sold per
*developer* and not per seat. That is to say, that if you have a single PC
on which QT is installed and if two people periodically use the same PC
for doing work on QT, you will need to purchase two licenses and not one.

c) Also, QT licenses cannot be transferred between developers more often
than once every 6 months (if I recall correctly). That is to say that if
"Ram" and "Ravi" are two developers for whom you have purchased QT
licenses,  and if "Ram" goes on a holiday or leaves the company, you
cannot bring in a new person and have him use the same QT license -
actually, you can.. but you cannot do this more often than once every 6
months.

d) If you plan to develop across platforms - linux, windows etc, you will
need to buy QT licenses for each such platform.

Regards,
PK

It is not FUD, Linux does violate a number of patents.

I agree.

Talking about patents, pretty much all parts of an OS has been patented in
some way or the other.. so it is really impossible to develop any OS parts
without violating some patent or the other.

But I don't think there is much to worry about this - the big companies
IBM, Oracle, Novell, Redhat, Sun etc have so much invested on Linux that
incase any patent dispute arises, it will be handled in court.

The only danger is if someone inadvertently or deliberately includes code
into the Linux/anyother-OSS-product from some commercial product. That is
something we need to watch out for.

The best guide I was suggested by Qt Devs and I myself found to be very 
helpful is the Qt Assistant. Better use Qt4 than Qt3 as things to have 
changed a lot.

Qt assistant has in-depth explanation of each class available in Qt, as 
well as it includes a series of 14 tutorials which will give you a good 
confidence of writing Qt code on your own. Also, there are additional 
examples with complete explanation for some real time apps like 
Calculator etc.

Actually, I used the Qt4 assistant tutorial and examples and tried to 
write them in PyQt4 to learn PyQt4.

You can also try out Qt Designer once you have pass through the basic 
knowledge of Qt programming. Do not start with Qt Designer and be 
dependent on it. Just use it as a tool to quickly create UIs while do 
the coding for logic part manually.

   Dear Friends,

   Thank you all for all the comments regarding the perl script executiion
   error.

   I have made the following modification in my server and it is working.

   It was httpd.conf which was restricting the cgi and perl from getting
   executed.
   I've modified, /usr/local/apache/http/conf/httpd.conf file

   Under ScriptAlias, I've added 2 directory listing
   #
      # "/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin" should be changed to whatever your
   ScriptAliased
      # CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.
      #

Hi Suresh

Convert your videos into FLV format so that flash movies can be viewed by
all browsers like youtube and google videos.

Other ways is to broadcast via VLC player and view by browser using VLC
plugin.

wishes.
