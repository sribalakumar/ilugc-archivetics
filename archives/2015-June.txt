Thanks to all who replied.

Actually I have a client who is interested in initiating (about to
start) a FOSS technology development work. My side I have not done
much development on FOSS other than teaching to needy on technology
like Python, Arduino etc.

Hence in case he gives me an option to develop a software - what are
things I should take care - does the FOSS development is done
completely free - making a team / space, product and functionality
research etc.

In all what are the things that one needs to do if one is venturing
into new FOSS development software?

Yes the software would be free but I have some confusion here. How do
people working in FOSS technology make some earning out of it. I mean I am
ready to dedicate my full time into it - but I need some fund as I would
space / resource and hardwares.

So where does money related to all this activities / expenses comes from -
where does the monthly working capital comes in?

Is it just the credibility that the team gets for developing FOSS
technology - let us pick one example - Python - they have a huge portal /
resource and their software is free to develop apps - in case I start
working voluntary (to fix bugs / support) for Python team - what would I
get in return - this just for the concern that if I leave my job and
dedicate my work for FOSS development the basic question of survival is
defending me to do so?

Firstly, people work in FOSS because they like working with it -
freedom of source code, documentation, community etc. Earning money is
only a side-effect.

You can earn through services, support and training. There are
different business models that you can adopt. Please use a search
engine for more info on the topic. For a start:

?Save some from the earnings you are making now like any other business.?

?you may or may not get upfront Capital like for  other businesses since
its ?service oriented kind of business , so its like this you can write
free software and ask for donations or charge users for supporting your
product .You can write custom software and  charge for the services you
rendered etc.. these are some of the ways people make a living out here .
If it looks like too much of risks the easy path i advice is take a day job
in Foss technologies , the end product may or may not be Foss so it all
depends on what you need and the company can offer.

?these are too many forks of the same question, there is no straight answer
to it :P ,  you need to hangout a bit longer here and thousands of groups
and mailing lists from around the world . See how things pan out for you ,
btw you also need to start to learn about ?

I am one who fits in the above category.  My experience might give you
some idea about, how I am making money using FOSS business model.

My company (LinuXpert Systems) provide support services like FOSS Lab
setup, Training (mostly relevant to academic curriculum) and several
other services using FOSS for most Engineering colleges in the state
since 2003.

Though, we are not doing any software development kind of work, but we
do customization of selective FOSS software for our customers (ex.
Koha for Library Automation, DSpace for Institutional Repository,
OpenELEC for Media Library etc. to name a few).

Now-a-days, most colleges were suffering from Proprietary Software
licensing issues.  For them we build Custom Linux distribution (with
all the academic relevant FOSS packages) for fulfilling their academic
requirements.

If the intention is about making money, customize existing FOSS
software by adding features which will generate good revenue model.

Hi

>>I propose Shri K.Baskar for the co-ordinator post. He has been with
ILUGC for well over a decade, a fulltime FOSS enthusiast and
entrepreneur. He has actively participated, lead and volunteered in
many events.

With due respects to K Baskar, I would suggest this position can be
consider for younger people.

Please identify and propose whoever  you recommend and let  members

Dear All,

Since the suggestion for younger people came, I would suggest Shantha
Kumar, Final Year, studying at Panimalar. He has been actively
participating in meetups. More over in Chennai there are few working
professionals who were part of college level GLUGs which were mentored by
FSFTN. We can form a co-ordination team comprising of these working
professionals and students and give them responsibility to drive activities.

Probably in coming meeting we can call these people and constitute a
co-ordination team and give them guidelines for activities.

Agree with Raman. If you feel the proposed person is not appropriate,
propose another name.

IMO, discriminating on age is bad!

Hi All,

I agree with Raman.

I hope, few might remember about the discussion during May 2010[1]. When I
step down from the ILUGC Office Boy post, Alagunambi name was also
suggested for the post. At that time, he was in the final year. That is the
main reason for me, not to support him. Final year is important time,
student need to spend time with course, project, job search etc. Now for
the same reason, I am not supporting Shantha Kumar.

I suggest, Baskar to be an in-charge for a year. Next year, if Shantha
Kumar interested, he can take over from Baskar. I am sure, Baskar will be
happy to do that.

Hi All,


I too give my vote to Shantha Kumar for the ILUGC co-ordinator. I feel
that when a student is co-ordinator he will be able to speak and it will
be more easily to spread the freedom and linux to future generation. We
have a standing example as Alaghunambi welkin and many others in this case.

I am fine with Baskar as long as he draws a clear line between his
company work, and ILUG-C meet-ups.

I'd prefer that GLUG members use their own platform for their
activities. A LUG has both free and open source folks, but, GLUGs are,
by definition, strong proponents of Free Software. I am surprised that
they are even participating and posting to a LUG list!

Dear All,

For any individual there would always be hurdles in working consistently.
That is why then(last time co-ordinator change) and now I am proposing to
form a collective/committee, which can drive the activities inspite of
single person's absence, activities should continue, and it should be
restricted only monthly meetups which are happening more or like tokenism.

To come out of this stagnation mode, as a community we should discuss and
finalize short term goals which we as community would be aiming to achieve
in 6months or in a year.

Shantha Kumar, Baskar, and even few more interested people can be part of
it, with commitment by each one to take responsibility and volunteer
physically & virtually to fulfill community short-term goals.

I can think of following criteria's as basic needs of this committee,

   - The committee should be changed periodically, say once a year.
   - There should be accountability for the responsibility each committee
   member take.
   - There should not be hierarchy inside this committee.
   - There should not be one who could just give suggestions and expect
   others should execute inside this committee.

As far as ILUGC is concerned there  is no hierarchy. As Bharathi used
to say repeatedly co-ordinator is office-boy, let us not complicate
this simple system. All of us me, Shakthi, Thyagu and many others are
always doing things similar to what the proposed committee members do.
In ILUGC every member is in the committee.

I do agree with Bharathi Subramanian.

There is not much physical community activities in ILUG-C for the past
few years.  I hope if Mr. K. Baskar be an in-charge, he might organise
physical events.

             It is a figure of speech, and in the very literal sense in
this context, when Bharathi was the co-ordinator, he called the role(his
role) "Office-boy", no sexism there. In my opinion, we don't have to be
politically correct here - Technical correctness is sufficient.
Concentrating on Political correctness and the use of gender neutral words,
in a language that is not the first language, can interrupt the flow of
thought for the actual message that is being conveyed. No one wants to
discriminate against anyone in this lug. Thanks.

Rightly said by Shakthi. Individual contribution is the core of ILUGC. If
anyone say, I will contribute only if I am the co-ordinator, then we need
to make every one as a co-ordinator (office boy).

Why Co-ordinator Post == Office Boy/ Girl [I hope, now Mani will be happy
;) ]

If you take any typical office, the actual work done by the officers. The
office boy's work is opening/ closing of the office, assemble file, remind
everyone about meetings, arranging stuff for the meeting and assist
everyone in the office. And importantly, office boy is the 1st friendly
person, who will talk to you in the new office. If you closely look at the
functionality of co-ordinator, is very similar to the above :)

If this is what being practiced, and I hope it is also true that, community
is in a stagnation mode, no activity other than monthly meetups, which
turned into tokenism taking place.

Lets try to change it, what is the problem in giving new people
responsibilities and experienced members of community guiding them?

A single person co-ordination has its limitation, he/she has family,
studies, work, and entertainments, with all these I am sure he/she can
organize a meetup monthly, but is that enough? what happened to FOSS Conf?
dont we need to increase community and reach of community owned
technologies?

Single person will again lead to stagnation, form a committee officially
and give responsibilities to it, allow new people to be active and make
them drive community collectively.

Please take lead to organise FOSS conf, I will support you as much as
I can. There is no need for you to be in any committee. I am sure all
others in ILUGC will help you.

I you start planning now we can probably organise in December/Jan 16.
Please go ahead.

Nobody wants to give a talk and teach at the meet-ups, but, everyone
wants to have a say on the co-ordinator :)

Dear Raman,

I think there is a mis-understanding, I am not here to place myself in any
committee of ILUGC. I am here as Executive Committee Member of FSFTN, who
is keen on taking forward Free Software & Free Knowledge to as many people
as possible and in that motive, I see my birth community ILUGC is
stagnating and not helping for the common cause. FSFTN will provide any
support necessary when ever needed, without invitation.

I am proposing a system to make community more useful for a common cause.

That is community, so as a community, any one can discuss and involve
in setting goals, and let the active, working, physical volunteers
drive it with the people who come forward to support them.

Support to,
1) Setting Goals for Community and
2) Forming a Team to Execute the Goals with community and as a community.

Lets change this and make co-ordination more than office-boy work, by
enabling more responsibilities to increase community activity.

Available resources tend to fluctuate a lot. More so when
collaboration is involved.
IMO, the model will work only if a minimum amount of resources can be
guaranteed over a suitable period of time.

The other part is sustainability. Usually in a FOSS community, we want
our model to be self-sustaining - the details are important.

It will be nice if you can work out a draft model for more detailed discussion.

If there is a consensus among community members to explore my proposal, we
can collectively draft a model.

I conducted classes in similar angle.

For transport layer, I used simple (TCP and UDP) socket code to cover the
basics
For application layer,  I used simple web server (http and https) setup.
You can touch REST API example also.
Other tools Ping (for ICMP), arping (for ARP) and netcat. Of course,
wireshark used to show packet traces.

Few other tools (don't remember the name) to send TCP SYC and FIN packets
also can be used. Always setup own network with separate switch/hub and 2/3
nodes. Otherwise, we need to handle the noises from other nodes/network.

Bye :)

That is where the problem is :)

Your designation is within the organization that you represent, not outside.

When you come to ILUG-C, you come as an individual contributor. It
doesn't matter whether you are President or Prime Minister or what
not.

My point is to reiterate that I dont have intention to be part of the
proposed committee and have a responsibility already.

I am no where talking against individual contributors, but to amplify the
individual contribution which is no where present except from a certain few
old members.

I dont understand how that is a problem. can you please explain?

My association was after 2009 FOSS Conf. with ILUGC and later towards
FSFTN, so kindly explain me the point you are trying to convey by quoting
this?

Sorry if I have created a wrong impression. It is my personal interest to
be part of here, more than organizational need. Please ignore my footer, if
that is what makes you think I speak from organizational authority. I speak
as a one of this community member, who got introduced to the world of
GNU/Linux and Knowledge Freedom through the event FOSS Conf 2009, and to
the betterment of community.

I have great respect to you, I am puzzled why you have hatred towards
FSFTN, care to clarify?

If it is a valid criticism, FSFTN as an organization will accept it and
work towards rectifying it, if not at least mis-understandings would get
clear.

To make my intention clear, the proposal for forming a committee, and
community deciding short term goal no incentive to FSFTN, than helping the
fellow communities work effectively towards the common goals.

I have already answered that earlier. This is not the place to talk
about FSFTN, or its agenda.

Everyone is an individual contributor here, and your designation doesn't matter.

Please attend meet-ups to know what ILUG-C is, before proposing
changes. Just shooting an e-mail for the sake of it doesn't work!

Dear All,

Sorry to drag this thread this long, I personally feel, it is important
moment, and a proper discussion should be done. It is not my fault for this
drag.

Dear Shakthi Kannan,

I have already answered that earlier. This is not the place to talk
> about FSFTN, or its agenda.
>

Thank you for giving clear impression that you will not understand, I hope
it is of useless to discuss to you about your prejudice about FSFTN, which
is creating a wrong impression and dragging this thread.

Everyone is an individual contributor here
>

If having a co-ordinator has not affected individual contributors, how come
having a team of co-ordinators will affect individual contributors?

Detailed explanation will put in another mail.


> Please attend meet-ups to know what ILUG-C is, before proposing

If it is a criteria to share opinion, I would have done so, considering the
importance of this subject. Please tell me how many meetings should I
attend to speak here?

FYI, I have been attending few years of ILUGC meetings and let me know if
my presence has any advantage for community, I would happily do so.

Having a single co-ordinator is an idea, and I am contesting it with
another idea of having a team instead of single person. Without contesting
it with valid reasons bashing at FSFTN, and creating baseless accusations
is what I feel, emailing for the sake of it.

Dear All,

Let me clarify my proposal again,

*Short-Term-Goals*:
Let community decide collectively what is the goal as a community which we
are trying to achieve for a year.

*Why?* By adopting this process we create a great scope to involve
interested people from community, who otherwise remained dormant or just a
spectator, to give suggestion on what they feel as necessary and what can
we as a community to be done for a year. *Isnt it involving individual
contributors?*

*Co-ordination Committee:*
A team of volunteers, who come forward to implement the collectively
decided short-term-goal. With following basic qualities,

1) Co-ordination Committee should not have hierarchy.
2) Co-ordination Committee should have physical volunteers.
3) Co-ordination Committee members should be accountable.
4) Co-ordination Committee should be changed periodically, say once a year.

*Why?*
1) No hierarchy: is because of the practice of community model.
2) Necessary of physical volunteers: is because we need people on the
ground to organize anything to reach public.
3) Need for accountability: it is to make sure, there are no one sitting
inside committee and just give suggestion.
4) Periodical Change: it is to make sure, we give opportunity for new
people, through which they learn organizing events.

*More:*
1) Already guiding team( Raman, Bharathi, Shakthi, Baskar, Thyagarajan, and
others) are doing great in community. Can they do it eternally?
2) I hope there is already an external co-ordination happening to guide
co-ordinator outside malinglist, why not formalize it?
3) having co-ordinator never stopped any individual from contributing, how
come having a team of co-ordinators will affect individual contributions?

*Core point:* Defining short-term-goals will make a mailinglist a action
oriented community. Individual co-ordinator as a model has short comings,
which we have experienced, let us try a team of co-ordinators without
hindering the community principles.

If there people feel discomfort in my proposal, please do question it.

In that case many haven't contributed as a coder to free software and are

Subject: [Ilugc] On selecting co-ordinator
Message-ID: <CAND27953Qx6+fFQXbaP1HP8NjMn5CX_e+7kBoV7pjTnZtrZkYw@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

In chennai, there are many tech communities are doing excellent works
like ilugc, fsftn, chennaipy, chennaigeeks, chennai.rb, etc.

Each have their own goals and volunteer team to move further.

All the communities are run only by volunteers. When the number of
volunteers goes to zero, that community goes to pause mode. Example,
kanchilug.

To run ilugc meets and other activities we need volunteers.
To get volunteers, we have to run more events.

As welkin told, it will be good if we have a volunteer team to
co-ordinate the events.

we tried it few years ago. But, it failed.
http://ilugc.in/content/new-volunteer-team-for-ilugc/

But running meetings is the only regular activity, we do. It was
handled by single co-ordinator.

Other activities did not happened, as the volunteers could not make them.

As all the activities are based on volunteers and their time,
it is good, if something happens.
It is okey, if something not happens.

As meetings are the only regular events, those can be co-ordinated by
a single person. We dont need a team.

Anyone can propose extra events and call for volunteers, like shakthi
is doing for installfests.

All other historical events like SFD, FossConf were initiated by some
member in the list, as proposing the idea and calling for volunteers.
The people whoever could volunteer for the events, they contributed
and executed the events.

There was not a regular team to co-ordinate/volunteer for the event.

What we miss nowadays are the proposal for the events.

Some expect that o-ordinator should initiate the proposals and call
for volunteers, which wont happen.

If we have a co-ordinating team, people will think that they only
should initiate the things.

ILUGC is a non-structured group of volunteers. All the members are
equal and volunteers.

co-ordinaor is an office boy to help people to run the events and meetings.
This role can be played by any interested person regardless of the
age, job or year of the college.

We can form ad-hoc volunteer team for any event and execute it.

The real factor is we dont have volunteers even to give talks on the meetings.
See the history of past few meetings. Shakthi is the only regular speaker.
Most of the times, we dont get speakers till the previous day of the event.

Many times, I made calls and wrote personal emails to friends, to give
a talk, and just make sure that the meetings are happening regularly.

It will be good, if we form a speaker team on various topics, so that
the meetings are planned well, announced at least one week before, so
that we can announce the events on various media/lists.

We have to collaborate with other communities like FSFTN, ChennaiPy so
that we can share speakers and volunteers for the meetings and events.

We can do more events like InstallFests, hackathons, workshops,
seminars, FossConf. I request members to propose for their desired
events, call for volunteers and initiate the discussions.

The child projects of ilugc like kaniyam.com, freetamilebooks.com are
doing good and growing well, with volunteers from around the globe.

i request K.Baskar and Shanthakumar to discuss with themself and
select one among themself or share their roles as primary/backup
co-ordinators and announce to the list soon.

Let us help them to run the meetings by giving talks, attending the meetings.

Propose for something, start doing it and call for assistance.
People will join, if they feel it is something worth contributing.


Let us celebrate the volunteers, who make the movements.

I have found codecademy[1] very easy to learn as its learning by doing than
reading. If you familiar with basics of programming, this helps learning
python concepts.

Message-ID: <557ED1AF.2010806@hamaralinux.org>

Hi there,
Want to find out how a GNU/Linux distribution actually happens,
what all goes into making a distribution and be paid to do it ?

Have you ever worked on some open-source project, only to realize that
the potential is huge and dunno how to relate it to others ?

Have you ever been called crazy because what you know of life is that it's
an abstraction of the TUI/CLI and that's the only way life is worth living .

If any or all of the above rings true, drop us a mail. We are looking
for individuals :-

    a. Who eat,drink, sleep and shit Open-Source
    b. Who have a thousand and one ideas about what is wrong in today's
   computing and have made some efforts to change them.
    c. Who have at least have some idea of what a VCS (Version Control 
System) is, and at the very least has made an account on one of such 
public hosting sites and has contributed some time and effort to one or 
more public
projects.  If it's a patch or a pull request it is preferable.

   Duration :- The position is of 6 months .

   Place :- This could be a mix of on-site and remote internship. The
   company is based in Gurgaon. The intern would have to manage travel
   to-and-fro from Delhi to wherever they live.

   Allowance :-  Rupees ten thousand per month.

   Look forward to hearing from you on careers at hamaralinux.org

As far as emails are not received in inbox, it probably is because you 
have made filters If you remove those filters then they probably will be 
seen in your Inbox without going to any folders or whatever filter you 
have put up.

As far as the "blocked symbol" is concerned, can you share a screenshot 
so the list/I could know what you are talking about ?

Message-ID: <CACX5wchj9Yc5a64YYYf5bRgy7AnAGMaNBUvhp9y22-q_7byzNw@mail.gmail.com>

When I see and try to read / understand FOSS source code files - I get
confused or rather the code confuses me - they are so well written or
rather to complex to understand at first pass.

Why can't I write code of that quality - what is missing in me? Is it
that the FOSS developers are great coders - they know designing /
coding in-depth.?  Are FOSS developers exposed to great code under
great brains at their very early stage of career?

I come from Indian IT software background - bug fixing / support /
maintenance etc are my daily work. But still I want to learn / skill
myself like a good coder / planner. Unfortunately I do not have proper
channels to educate me or give exposure.

Now what I can do - I cannot keep reading books to understand each bit
of design / language for implementation.

Why can't I write good code? What it takes to write great code? Does
the code needs to be really complex or leverage best Industry
standards? When I reach people for clarifications they state "Sorry I
do not know" ....

Linux / Python etc or Puppet / Scilab etc etc .. there are endless
product to state - whereas we are just trying to scale. I have never
heard a fresher stating I am good at designing or companies asking
question regards to same.

Whats an average life stage (in yrs) of development of a FOSS
technology - how its gets popular - how people pool in .. how it
becomes popular .. how do they conceive ideas ..

Imagine I start a FOSS development work and my colleagues states that
its bad code and shoves away .. how other FOSS developers synchronize
on expertise ..

There is no shortcut for writing the good code.
One need to keep reading books, keep coding.
Unless one read how he/she will know whats good or bad code is.

Some programmers will really have good logic programming, and for remaining
they need develop within them.

also one can write good code if his/her knowledge on os internals, language
(c in case of kernel programming) , processor architecture, algorithms.
having this knowledge one can understand how code will translated to
machine language, how its will get executed etc.

so my suggestion keep reading , keep coding!!! Your code quality will
definitely improve. remember that there are always more than one way to
write certain logic.

What is your experience in programming?
Though it is debated now, Malcolm Gladwell in his book "Outliers : The
story of success" claims it takes 10,000 hours of practice to achieve
mastery in any field :

Just to add what other have mentioned. Enjoy while learning or Programming,
and Most important Have fun.

The people who have written great code didn't do it to prove how great
they are , It turned out to be great /well written code because they enjoyed
the process.

Paraphrasing from what Linus mentioned in the book. "Just for fun,"

Linus had great fun while working on linux, and so should you.

My 2c.

I was looking for the same a couple of years ago.
Search keywords "openldap proxy active directory" will give you links
to start your research on the implementation.

Message-ID: <CACm7z1aP0O0kCebPmU0bJLB+4gCStWT3cuHj72LQbS-PK5aa7A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello people,

FSFTN is organizing Cryptoparty this Sunday (28.6.2015) at Asian College of
Journalism, Chennai.

"Governments around the world, are greatly increasing their surveillance of
the Internet. Alongside a loss of the private sphere, this also represents
a clear danger to basic civil liberties. The good news is that we already
have the solution: encrypting communications makes it very hard, if not
entirely impossible, for others to eavesdrop on our conversations. The bad
news is that crypto is largely ignored by the general public, partly
because they don't know about it, and partly because even if they do, it
seems too much trouble to implement."

*So lets go and have a party, and teach each other how to crypto!*

For more information about the event please visit the following links:

   - http://discuss.fsftn.org/t/cryptoparty-chennai/376
   - https://www.cryptoparty.in/chennai
   -
   http://www.meetup.com/Free-Software-Foundation-TamilNadu/events/223463630/

Registration is Free, but they are limited.

I agree with other's comments but here is my take -
IMO, good Systems Analysis/ Design (SA/SD) is the essence of any
system.  Coding is the implementation part.

Unfortunately, the education system starts of with programming
language(s) with little or no emphasis on SA/SD.

The "stalwarts" usually have the SA/SD in their heads and it's result
is high quality code

Can anyone please share a practical approach to design / implement code?

I would like to understand how the design process starts , how a coder
understands the system and implementation? What are the by-products of
design phase - how there documents gates converted to coding?

Prakash

Too much analysis will lead to paralysis :-) The best way to learn swimming
is to get into the water. Begin in the shallow end and work your way
towards the deep end. You'll slip and learn some lessons the hard way,
which, incidentally is the surest way. You'll have to curb the tendency to
look up to the 'aces' and seek their approval. They don't care!

Cheers,
mano

Subject: [Ilugc] [Blog] - Compressing Large video files
Message-ID: <CAFHFDAkdwEVeje0WKg6A0jgLbNj5jn81z2ogyDqt1zKjnHTOSQ@mail.gmail.com>

I wrote a recent blog[2] and though that I could share it with the
community to get their feedback.  To avoid people telling me that I am
making others going to my blog I have copy pasted the contents here except
for the code.
Compressing Large video files
 My phone records video in HD nothing new here.  However the file size of
each and every video is enormous.  So like any other person I started
googling to see how I can compress the video files.  I came up with this
following bash script [1].  This script will basically list all MP4 files
in our directory.  Then use VLC command line parameters to compress the
file.   Oh and one more thing it can also rotate the video automatically to
Landscape mode if it was taken in Portrait mode.

[1]
http://pastebin.com/5VTBWkG5

I was able to get pretty good compression.  My file size which was 24.7 MB
got compressed to ~8 MB.

We can have the election, in the upcoming meeting, if required and if
many people show interest.

Interested people can attend the meeting and discuss.

We need a person, atleast to announce and co-ordinate the next meeting. :-)

Baskar ( baskar910 at gmail.com ) agreed to be assist on conducting
meeting, until election happens or someone else is interested in
taking the role.

Thanks Baskar.

Hi,


I request the list to consider to conduct "free and fair election", prior
to this there needs a discussion on 'panel formation' as proposed by
Alagunambi Welkin.

I feel the list members need not be included. The election exercise should
be restricted to those who physically attend the LUG events.
