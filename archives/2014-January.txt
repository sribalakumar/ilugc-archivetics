Though most SBCs are ARM based and runs GNU/Linux, Android on them, the
topic is related only to SBC, so I tagged it as OT.

I use the following SBC for my projects.

BeagleBoneBlack (comes with Angstrom Linux by default and currently I am
using Debian Wheezy 7.2 in the onboard 2GB NAND Flash replacing Angstrom)
http://s3.armhf.com/debian/wheezy/bone/debian-wheezy-7.2-armhf-3.8.13-bone30.img.xz

CubieTruck (comes with Android 4.2 by default and I am using Fedora-20 in
the onboard 8GB NAND Flash)
http://dl.cubieboard.org/software/a20-cubietruck/fedora/ct-fedora20/fedora20-nand.img.gz

Both BeagleBoneBlack and CubieTruck were bought from www.crazypi.com.
Price informations can be had from the website.

Message-ID: <CA+TDRNOUw=t5C2VDfG3J-1RyVt=5hPCLv=wmYbBOrmbtnZMB6A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

We are a startup based in Chennai and have a few internship opportunities
for recent engineering graduates.
Current students are also welcome if their teachers/department do not
object to them earning some fee and spending the time.
The candidates must have demonstrable experience on GNU/Linux and have
solid programming expertise in preferably C/C++
Experience in Golang/Dartlang would be an added advantage.
The candidates must have good understanding of software development
fundamentals.

The selected candidates would be extremely hard-working and driven to excel.
They would be able to work well with other team members and will have every
opportunity to closely interact and contribute to the open source community.
The projects they work on will be chosen by matching the candidate skills
with company needs.

The internship projects may lead to full-time consulting positions
depending on company growth need and internship success.


If you are interested in applying for the position described above, please
email your resume to rajkumar DOT natarajan AT gmail DOT com, with a
subject line
ILUGC-firstname-lastname.   If included, links to your FOSS work is a
superior gauge of technical and team ability.


Thanks,
Dennis

Message-ID: <CABe_ZfJ4o8yjb0Cqym_QL3KHyUoTM=y2ocMkywqkLJNdZdGGxw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I installed OpenERP Version 7.0-20130429-232454 in Ubuntu 12.04. I could
login to OpenERP using the local user created in OpenERP. I need to enable
LDAP authentication ( Using Windows Server 2003 R2 Domain controller ) so I
installed python-ldap library in Ubuntu  and LDAP authentication module in
OpenERP.However domain users can not login to OpenERP. The configurations
are

LDAP Server address : server.domain.local

LDAP binddn : CN=webmaster,OU=WSUS,DC=domain,DC=local

LDAP Base : OU=WSUS,DC=domain,DC=local

LDAP Server Port : 389

LDAP Password : **********

LDAP Filter : sAMAccountName=%s

Create User : yes

Sequence : 10

Template User : User1

TLS : Yes

 I posted the same question in OpenERP forum as well. If any of you have
experience with OpenERP with LDAP authentication please let me know your
suggestions.

Regards,

Jithin k

Do provide apache logs also so one can identify what's actually
happening, especially the error logs would be useful.

I have doubt with ServerName directive.

The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
the server uses to identify itself.
ServerName [scheme://]fully-qualified-domain-name[:port]

Since your Apache's DocumentRoot is /home/jagan/, you need to set chmod 711
for /home/jagan/ to work.

Try and post your results.

It will be better to write a udev rule for wvdial, so that it will
automatically connect to the internet whenever the datacard is detected.

You can use ldapsearch utility to test your configurations.

The syntax for using ldapsearch:

ldapsearch -x -LLL -h [host] -D [user] -w [password] -b [base DN] -s
sub "([filter])" [attribute list]

A simple example

$ ldapsearch -x -LLL -h host.example.com -D user -w password
-b"dc=ad,dc=example,dc=com" -s sub "(objectClass=user)" givenName

You can try with these GUI tools too.

It's lengthy, you'll have to flip through pages to see all categories.

(Usual disclaimers of a survey apply, though it's not bad to have a look
at them.)

If you are a long term follower of such surveys, some results might
surprise you.

Ubuntu tops in most of the mass categories while Debian tops in some of
the niche categories. Ubuntu laptop maker System76 tops the laptop makers'
category, while Dell tops the desktop category very closely followed by
System76.

Gnome has gone down to 5th position KDE tops, though the desktop manager
space is fairly evenly spread.

Best Android app is Google Maps. (Well.. it sucks IMHO, but no good
alternatives either.)

Mozilla thunderbird @41% is way too ahead of others as email client, mutt
appears a yesteryears' favorite now with mere 4.8% share. (I use mutt and
feel like an endangered species... danger of being driven away to some
corner of an archaeological museum, with no idea about my wrongdoing.)

Libreoffice has overwhelmingly taken over other office suites with near
72% vote share, open-office reducing to just 6.7%.

vlc tops best audio players list with 21.7%. I am shocked to see mplayer
down at 9th position with 3.9% votes. However as media player it is at 2nd
position with 13.1% and vlc at first with 60.3%.

Despite Linus' well known criticism of Nvidia, Nvidia tops the best video
chipset with 51.6%.

CVS does not even figure in configuration management / revision control
category. (I still use CVS. Endangered species again...)

Both as a programming language and as a scripting language, Python tops
leaving others way behind.

No surprises for vi/vim topping the editors' list, though it also comes
2nd as IDE (behind Eclipse)!

openjdk java leaves Oracle Java way too behind with over 65% votes.

Although btrfs has acquired a good vote share and 2nd position at 13%, it
is still way too behind big brother ext4 which tops with massive 72.5%.

We all start with limited knowledge. That is perfectly normal.

DNS queries cannot limit the network speed and cannot be the
bottleneck unless you have a really broken
  DNS server.

You can measure the time taken with the command

$ time dig www.mit.edu

or something to make sure it does not come from the cache.

Usually network slowness is caused due to either a wireless link or a
badly provisioned copper link or
 some similar issue at the exchange/ISP end.

There may also be slowness due to other computers on the local LAN
that are downloading big files.

Netflow is a tool used in the network periphery device like router or
MODEM to figure out how your network
 is being used.

But netflow can only tell you about local problems.

www.speedtest.net

can tell you about your ISP and its latency.

You can optionally use ping latency to figure out how things are
getting on but it is not very accurate
 and it is only a very broad parameter and not a very good method. But
I am sure that does serve as a
 smoking gun to prove that things are wrong and you can use it for
further testing and analysis.

The ping times should be within 400 ms for most paths.

Let me analyze this reply.

1. Generally, unless names are explicitly used the reply is directed
to list. So this amounts to addressing all the female members
(including me) as "sir"  - this qualifies as microaggression

 If it was directed at me then it is far more serious - it amounts to
hate (my profile picture is about pride).

2. Ganesh Gopal <ganeshg91 at gmail.com> is too vague, self-centered and
has not bothered to read the original post.


Who will want to work with a person who is almost certainly sexist,
discriminates on the basis of gender, does not pay attention to the
issue at hand and cannot see any larger picture?
Modern managers will tend to stick to safer programs instead.

It is possible if you or some other volunteer come forward to make the
necessary infrastructure ready (camera, internet etc) and record the
session.

Hi

>>It is possible if you or some other volunteer come forward to make the
necessary infrastructure ready (camera, internet etc) and record the
session.

With due respects to this idea.
I would reiterate the idea of inviting friends and relatives to the meet.
Our priority is 'Physical volunteers' .
Let us focus on putting on the strength of attendees for our meet.

Kindly consider to shift the upcoming meet to following saturday on account
of 'Pongal'.


regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Hi

My house is near central and say if I take the auto to come to IIT Chennai
due to my personal reasons I have to shell out ~ RS. 250 one way and would
take equally that much back to my house.  I cannot shell out RS 500 just on
travel alone :-(, Since I am interested in sharing and gaining knowledge I
feel it is more apt and easy for many people to join the meeting should
this happen over the web.

If people don't consider me cheap I can contribute RS 50 towards making
this meeting possible over the web.  I know this is a small amount however
if some more people join together I guess the fund should be enough to have
it over the net.  I have also heard about the counter comment that if money
is involved it leads to unnecessary disputes (I am really not sure how to
get that resolved).

I remember someone talking about big blue button does someone have it
installed available for free community use ?

This is just my thought say if we can get a VPS ~ RS 300/month we can
install the big blue button and have the meeting over there as well.

PS: This email is drafted and sent just for taking the next step in
reaching out to a larger community and not intended to hurt any one's
feelings :-)

you have a train which is reasonable at fare
and also by travelling in public transport will reduce the pollution
emission.

IMPO we dont need to spend anything for that, we can just have Google
Hangouts if we need.

If someone says *personal reasons*,  i think, it is courteous to not to
probe further...

You meant, Hangouts with webcam? Hangouts is fine for connectivity and
conferencing, but for broadcasting / capturing the sessions with good
quality, some better recording equipment than webcam is required?

Why can't we use skype or record it by the presenter (self) and upload in youtube? The presenter can always be called offline for quiries.

If someone says *personal reasons*,? i think, it is courteous to not to
probe further...

You meant, Hangouts with webcam? Hangouts is fine for connectivity and
conferencing, but for broadcasting / capturing the sessions with good
quality, some better recording equipment than webcam is required?

Needs a good camera capable of 720p. Hangouts does take a lot of bandwidth
but lower than Skype. Look up oneklikstreet.com - bandwidth efficient
broadcasting solution. I advise this company and can get some good deals,
possibly free too,  for our community.

        Because skype isn't a free software - At least for free
software user group meetings, we should restrict to using free
software. And, before that, please do not top post. Thanks

Same thing happens to me in Bangalore :( Travel takes the maximum expense.

        We should possibly have physical + web, if at all. Because we
are still not a country where most people have unlimited high speed
broadband. So, people might have difficulty having it over the web.
But physical + web would mean have a phone/conferencing system at the
venue and it needs to be of a reasonable quality so that the people on
the phone/conference can hear every one in the venue. This setup, I
think, might get quite expensive. But we have quite a lot of people on
this list who have expertise is these kinds of
setups(conferencing/hardware setup). They might have some suggestions.

       But there will be one pertinent counter point - Meetings over
the web are not the same as physical/real meetings where you actually
meet fellow volunteers. Because, when we have the free software user
groups meetings, it is not just the agenda that is followed - You meet
other people with similar interests as you and have a small chat and
by means of that get to know of more projects/tools etc. It is this
means of gathering/spreading knowledge that makes user group meetings
interesting. When you have the meetings over the web, you will lose
out on those aspects.

     Of course, mostly my own thoughts - But good to consider when we
take these kind of decisions :) Thanks

medium(online)...

Dear All,

i am having 2 Internet line.

Line 1 reliance
Line 2 Airtel

By default internet will serve from Line1(Reliance)
if Line 1 is down then the Internet will serve from Line2(Airtel), If Line
1 is up then it will switchover.

That was working fine with Zentyal setup



*What i want is*
*When ever there is an request from a client machine to access the url
www.google.com <http://www.google.com> it has to serve from Airtel line.*

Is it possible ?
How to do that ?

Can you please help,

Thanks in advance

        Can you do a proper trimmed posting(which means do not do top
posting) ? And I can relate to only what I have experienced(I can only
guess that mail was directed at me and not at Balasubramaniam
Natarajan)  And if you look at my response again, I said the same
thing - physical meetings are better(though we can have fully
interactive sessions online as well). Thanks

To: mailinglist at fsftn.org


Dear All.

Free Software Foundation Tamil Nadu (FSFTN) invites applications for
final-semester projects from B.E/B. Tech students in Computer Science and
IT streams. The duration of the project will be for one semester and will
be done in free software. On completion of the project, the student will
get a certificate from FSFTN.

Interested students must send their resume and list of interests to
ask at fsftn.org. The last date of application is January 12.

Eligible candidates will be interviewed over phone and a final list will be
announced on January 14.

1) All the projects will be in the domain of Free Software.

2) Students should be willing to spend a mandatory amount of hours at the
FSFTN office every week. The minimum number of hours will be decided
according to the scope of each project and after discussions with mentors.

3) Students need not have any familiarity with Free Software but must be
willing to learn on the project and quickly pick up skills.

4) The projects will have weekly or fortnightly releases. There will be
month-end reviews for each project.

Students will be qualified to manage projects and possess the necessary
skills considered premium by both the mainstream IT industry and the
emerging start-up economy.

Students will be guided by a group of mentors with a unique mixture of
academic and industrial experience. The focus will be on projects that
contribute to the building and support of the Free Software community. FSFTN
reserves the right to terminate the project if the criteria set for
students is not being met.

http://www.lartc.org/lartc.html - Check out the section on "Routing
for multiple uplinks/providers" - But from what I know, I doubt if you
can do it based on an URL. Based on ip addresses may be possible, but
not very sure about URLs. Thanks

I am very much interested in attending one ILUGC meet.
But, the thing that prevents me is Distance and the associated Travel!!

Imagine travelling 650 kms!!

Nice :).

> But, the thing that prevents me is Distance and the associated Travel!!

The problem is just an illusion I could say. I think there will be
GLUGs in many parts of our country and you can just go to a nearby
GLUG, share and gain knowledge. If there is no GLUG it is a great
chance for you to start one.

> Imagine travelling 650 kms!!

Effectively you need not travel for such distance. You can actually
just travel less than 10s of kilo meters.

There are people who have to travel 10s of kilometers to get good water...
Do you think GLUGS are more nearer??

        Initially, all of us start as very basic end users. But if you
start a GLUG near you and spread the news(word-of-mouth, or GLUGs
etc), you will soon find people (from beginners to experts) joining
you. And gradually, with the effort of all you guys, all of you will
learn more and benefit. So, you need not be worried about being just
an end user :)

            Definitely :) To get water, you need it to be available.
For GLUGs, you just need to decide to start one if there is none near
by  - So, yes, starting(and hence participating in) a GLUG is far
easier than getting water :) . Thanks

Hi,

I recently joined to this group.

I too suggest that video conferencing would be an optional one, but not the
replacement for physical meet. We will consider to broadcast our meet over
to the registered members and I think fund will not be an issue ( there
will be volunteers like me ).

Is there a way to find how many are planning to attend this meet?. I am
planning to attend.

Message-ID: <52CE4CB3.2010700@gmail.com>

Hi,

It would be great if some one could bring camcorder to ilugc meet. That 
would be the first step, events could be recorded and put on youtube. I 
have software called chm cheese on my laptop which I can record videos, 
possibly with sound. But I can tell nothing about the quality.

Right now I don't think ilugc has the power / money or resource to have 
a live streaming session.

I have long told other ilugc members that money is important, if we had 
money we can do something like this. But that would involve politics and 
other stuff which ilugc members are totally not interested.

Lot of people are interested in ilugc, and we must take democratic 
decisions, for which I have created a group in loomio 
https://www.loomio.org/groups/3100 , hope it will be useful.

I had spoken to the Project head of Msc.CS (Foss) they said that if the
meeting is on weekdays then they can arrange. if its on weekends then they
said no(because they are running class on every weekends).
If Planning to host the Meeting online through Anna university Msc.CS
(Foss) then coordinator(admin) of the Group has to communicate with the
Project Head, So that they can get approval with University.
You can reach the Project head with his email id: *sksaini at au-kbc.org

I have never been able to attend these meetings earlier due to my work - we
worked saturdays and now can't attend because of a young family and
associated saturday responsibilities :)
But, I want to see / be part of these meetings.

Let me take a proactive step - this is what I can do/provide:

   - I have a VPS for experiments and pet projects. This can be used for
   the live broadcast. It's comes with 3TB bandwidth so it is not a problem
   for me. It's got 4 public IP addresses and hence can even associate a
   unique URL.
   - I have installed and demoed Big Blue Button before and can do the same
   in this VPS. But I do not have prof experience. Anybody willing to learn
   can join me anytime
   - The server has got only 2GB ram. I do not know how this affects BBB in
   production. But I have demoed it with 2GB
   - I have a 720p high quality webcam which I can provide whenever
   required.
   - Uplink from site has to be taken care of by meeting volunteers. There
   are 2 workable options to my knowledge -
      - Most reliable - Windows/Mac Laptop + Adobe FMLE Flash Media Live
      Encoder
      - Hack/Rig - Linux laptop + FFMPEG

Let me know if this is useful.

Message-ID: <3a44d410d2e6aad5b19540851d3a99c7@felicity.iiit.ac.in>

 

Hello everyone! 

Felicity, the annual festival of IIIT Hyderabad, brings to you Felicity
Threads 2014, the tenth annual edition of the celebration of spirit of
computing and engineering. We bring to you a wide range of online
contests in various fields of programming and mathematics. Our series of
online events includes contests on algorithmic programming (Codecraft),
parallel programming (Kernel Cruise), combinatorial search and game
playing bot design (Strange Loop), and an unconventional programming
challenge (Time Limit Exceeded). 

Our second event, after Gordian Knot, a math contest, is Break In. 

Break In, is a Jeopardy-style Capture The Flag (CTF) contest, starting
on 1800 IST (1230 UTC), January 11, Saturday for 36 hours. It will be
filled with challenges from diverse areas of systems programming and
security (description here [1]). Participants will have to crawl the
depths of the web, pry open encrypted exchanges and reverse engineer
binaries to finally emerge victorious. 

The only prerequisite to participate is the urge to learn. Let us learn
and rejoice the spirit of computing and engineering together. 

There are exciting prizes for the event too! 

So be prepared for some and to know more about Threads, visit us at :

Hi,

We are launching an intensive 8 weeks software apprenticeship program.
Who is it for?

   - Programmers who are looking to up their game and get a better job
   - Programmers who want to enter the Ruby ecosystem

About Launchpad

*Learn by doing*

C42 Launchpad is not a classroom training, it's an intensive workshop. You
will learn various concepts by building actual, working software.

*Intensive*

C42 Launchpad covers a lot of topics in a short timeframe and is very
demanding. You will have to work hard to keep up with the pace.

*Duration*

C42 Launchpad is an eight weeks full-time course (8 hours a day, 5 days a
week).

*Language Agnostic*

While C42 Launchpad is delivered in Ruby, these programming practices are
applicable for any language or platform.
What will you learn?

C42 Launchpad was designed based on what top technology firms look for in
potential hires. Here is a rough outline of the concepts we will cover:

*Technical*

   - Understand what constitutes a clean, maintainable codebase
   - Object Oriented Programming, concepts and beyond
   - Design patterns and anti-patterns
   - Ruby and Rails
   - Test driven development
   - Git
   - HTML, CSS
   - Javascript - language and frameworks
   - OOP in Javascript

*Soft Skills*

   - Pair Programming
   - Collaboration
   - Agile development methodology
   - Giving and receiving feedback
   - Presentations and mentoring

Interested?

If you are interested in attending the Launchpad program or have any
questions, drop me a note at launchpad at c42.in.
Regards,
Niranjan

Subject: [Ilugc] Dual booting Win8 + Mint - Questions on Secure boot & GRUB
	boot loader
Message-ID: <CAOs2p9UbmUdH_YJ80HFPtvHhGOz2VyJuwHa6xw4Y2JvJ9KV6Yg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I recently bought a  new Laptop running Windows 8.1. To have some hands-on
experience with Linux, I decided to install Linux Mint.
As I am a newbie, I prefer prefer Windows running along side Linux Mint.
By googling, I came to know that Secure Boot (from now on SB) needs to be
disabled in order to install other OS, in my case Linux Mint 16 (Mate).
Going through the web I also noticed that disabling the Secure boot may
open the gates for rootkits (or malwares) to get installed.

My questios are

1. Is it OK to Disbale SB.
2. There is another option, to generate a key instead of entirely disabling
the SB. I just noticed this and I haven't went through the steps to create
the key.
3. Going through the Mint forum, I came across the word GRUB loader. Is it
necessary to install the GRUB?

Previously while installing Ubuntu in my desktop (BIOS), I had no problem /
confusions with new terms like SB, UEFI or GRUB loader.

Message-ID: <CALFmRoFvabukNEWZ31O3SdUjGfg_=XfBZsQq0dWR4dHuxWu+8w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

My office uses a proxy.pac file for the proxy configuration which has rules
for external urls to go via proxy while internal resources to be accessed
directly.

The issue is that I use a linux VM for development purposes where it is
possible to set an environment variable (http_proxy) which routes all
requests through that server. Becase of this , the internal resources stop
working inside linux. Is there any way for linux to  parse a PAC file and
apply the rules based on the URL requested?

Thanks,
Ganesh

Hello People,

Two guys from Sairam College have volunteered to present talks in the

another guy called Dinesh will speak about Rho mobile (getting started 
with it).

As I promised about video recording of the meet up, well, that won't be

The meet up is from 11 AM to possibly 1:30 PM. Held in:

Spritle, 1 A, M.G. Chakarapani Street,
Saligramam, Chennai. (opposite to Avichi School in Arcot Road)

And ya, there is a Linux meet up in IIT Aerospace building @ 3PM , will 
be glad if some of you would go there too.

Message-ID: <CAH6oG61-mxEdB=CBb45O2fxWvpS3bryCwjEbeK=9KCqnp3_z2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

     Facing issue while doing renewal of ssl certificate in Apache Tomcat
using below steps.


*Creating CSR:*


keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias root -keystore "app.key"
keytool -certreq -alias root -keyalg RSA ?file app.csr -keystore app.key

Another team is generating "cer" extension file by using above CSR.

Now I am importing app.cer using below step,

keytool -import -alias root -keystore app.key -trustcacerts -file app.cer


Now while opening application in browser, its saying "This CA Root
certificate is not trusted. To enable trust, install this certificate in
the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store".

Can any one please help on this?

Thanks in advance.

One of the possible ways is you need to work with iptables to get the
routing fixed up for both internal http access and external ip access.

Hi,

It is quite sometime that I worked on Apache tomcat. Don't you need to
mention the keysize?. Is it self-signed or purchased from third party? I
think, installing the new certificate and renewal involves the same steps.
This link may be helpful

Isn't squid a proxy server? I am not looking to deploy a proxy, just
trying to make my development linux machine work with my office proxy
server. In Windows, IE uses a .pac file (a javascript like syntax config
file http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config ) where you can specify
a rule which chooses the proxy based on the request URL.

I am just looking to replicate this logic of choosing the proxy/Direct
connection in linux. Firefox supports a pac file even on linux but chrome
looks for the system settings which is http_proxy environment variable.

Thanks,
Ganesh

I don't think Mint supports UEFI booting, atleast it didnt an year back.
All support forum guys asked me to switch to BIOS.

I have Arch and Ubuntu installed and both work fine with UEFI booting,
though I didnt try with SecureBoot because there isn't any windows
installed on the machine.

Can I have a show of hands of how many people participated in this event ?

My intention is to develop contacts of like minded people and when I
checked with people who I knew they were not interested in CTF for me to
build a team.  There was one guy who joined me however was unable to
continue since he had work.

I have not changed the topic to [OT] since most of the work required in the
CTF was done using GNU\LINUX.  The CTF did enable me to learn about my
strengths.

http://www.zdnet.com/uefi-boot-with-kororafedora-and-mintubuntu-hands-on-7000025085/
>> Mint support EFI boot.

Am no expert on the subject. On my friend's desktop I disabled
Secureboot and installed Mint using a Live USB without much issues.

1. I don't think desktops are that vulnerable. In the sense, we are a
minor group and not sure if someone would bother to hack. ;-) And for
years, we have been using BIOS w/o secure boot. If you're paranoid,
;-) go for option 2). BTW, Mint itself blocks kernel and Xorg upgrades
(level 4 and 5), some people even say Mint itself is vulnerable.

http://segfault.linuxmint.com/2013/11/answering-controversy-stability-vs-security-is-something-you-configure/

2. In my limited reading of the subject earlier, I think your UEFI
setup should support signing. Not sure if all vendors give this
option.

3. GRUB is automatically installed during any installation. It is the
program (bootloader) that loads the OS. there are other bootloaders
like LILO but GRUB is the common one, i suppose.

In case you have not seen this, the below link helps in understanding...

http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/

As you have done > Mint Forums are the best place to consult - with
some luck, you can even get option 2) done.

I requested a while ago for a session on UEFi when we were running
installation fest.

Also a training on correlation. pls buzz me with your interest, profile.
It may not be an attractive engagement, but certainly satisfying that we're

 Delhi government has expressed interest in adopting free software.
 RMS held discussions with CM and many other political leaders across
the political spectrum in the capital.

As far as the report in this link is concerned:
"  http://mathrubhuminews.in/ee/ReadMore/4280/delhi-government-for-free-software/M
"

RMS did not say that.

It is blatant misreporting mixed with extra falsehoods by the
right-wing newspaper.

AAP has no clear ideology and is a mess of all kinds of interests -
some of them seem to have done a bit on petty corruption, but many
backward anti-freedom views have been expressed by others.

Hi Chennai Rubyists

vakilsearch.com, a 3 year old Chennai based company is looking for great
hackers who *love Ruby* and *want to make a difference*.

Many of us have started our own businesses. Travelling in rush hour
traffic, fixing appointments and paying exorbitant fees are a few of the
painful experiences you might have had.

And again for getting your Trademark protected. And yet again for getting
your business registered to pay tax. The story is pretty much endless.

*But it doesn't need to be this way. *We believe that technology will
transform the services industry in India. And you have a chance to engineer
that transformation.

*About us:*

 With a team of 50+ people in Chennai and Bangalore, we are young, growing
and excited about creating a revolution in professional services.

*Young, enthusiastic hacker? We want you!*

Are you a hacker with a passion for creating great products on Ruby? Do you
share our vision to make the legal process simple for the common man and
businesses? Apply immediately to sahil at vakilsearch.com or call +91 9042 00
77 00.

Hameed

Indian IT is awash with success and failure stories of Infosys, TCS, Wipro, CTS.

But that is not something to be proud of.

Not for engineers of course. Maybe for MBA guys and people not capable
of thinking for themselves.

The true value created by India as a country lies in creating
technology and knowledge that people respect us for.

Here is the list of companies I know that have done that.

1) Zoho
2) Druva backup software
3) Fusion charts charting
4) jijitechnologies (Microsoft shop, ex Zoho)
5) visualwebsiteoptimizer.com (AB testing of websites)
6) Vembu storegrid ( ex Zoho)

Many more I dunno.

Each of these companies are making more than 5 million dollars.

Not all but most.

And Zoho has a product suite that touches the alpha to omega of computing.

So our country still manages to outlive the mediocrity mindset eh?

Just an example, A budding product:

http://www.linkedin.com/company/fortune-grecells-p-ltd
http://grecells.com/blackbox/

There are many such small companies who lack the marketing muscle and
branding related issues.

In old days, I used to whine about it. But nowadays google helps one

Hi,

I am using gnuplot for plotting data. I have a specific  problem.

I have a data file which has titles in its first row.  I want to generate
separate plots  for each data. Each  plot should be named after its
header.

Say, for instance

TIME    DISPLACEMENT   VELOCITY   ACCELERATION
0        0        15          0
1        10       100        5

set terminal png
set output "***.png"
plot for [i=2:4] **** using 1:i

I need the output of 1:2 as DISPLACEMENT.png, 1:3 as VELOCITY.png, etc.

Is there any way of doing it??

I help a NGO in Bangalore that works on identifying disabilities, one of
which is deafness. I learn that deafness is scientifically measured by
seeing responses to pure tone sounds from 250 to 1500Hz. Currently, special
equipment needs to be bought and is not very handy.

It occurred to me that this could be easily achieved using mobile phones.
Can some one on this list or their friends help out with this?

Need:
A simple UI driven program to choose frequencies from a radio button list
with a drop down list of time period for which the pure tone needs to play.
Possible inclusions - volume control, spectrum sweep across the whole set
of frequencies with display showing the frequency being played etc.

I would love to help.
I can develop the app both for Android and iOS.

The issues are:

   - Though the software can produce perfect perfect tones, the speaker of
   the mobile phone will be incapable of handling these low frequencies.
   - Suggest we take the output off the audio out and provide a super low
   cost amplifier and a speaker. A typical sub woofer circuit is specially
   tuned for these low frequencies and are available in plenty in Ritchie
   street.

If anyone else have suggestions, please add to this thread.

I also believe this can be a nice small Open source project for both
software and hardware.

It is my mistake and am sorry. Meant to be audible range and should have

Does the camera work with other software like cheese or gstreamer? If
so use html5 instead of flash.

Hope this helps,

This is called pure tone audiometry. I have never seen it being done but you can visit any practicing ENT surgeon in your neighborhood and ask him about it.

Anwat - Did you try entering the command as per the error instruction?
Open Terminal (Konsole if you are on KDE) and type the command 'sudo
dpkg --configure -a' and hit enter. It will prompt you for root
password and once you enter you should be good.

GNUOctave or Scilab come with toolboxes for Signal processing and Image
processing.

As you are familiar with Matlab you can easily adapt to GNUOctave, as its
syntax is very close to Matlab and GNUOctave is functionally as good as
Matlab in terms of speed as well when compared to Scilab.

QtOctave is GUI tool for octave and its look and feel are similar to Matlab
so you wont be having trouble adapting it.

Thanks, I understand your point. I am familiar with MATLAB but the issue I am facing is - how and what to do within MATLAB for Image Processing and DSP - actually I need information on implementation side. A completion of a couple of projects will give me a high boost.

Say I want to measure the temperature of eyes by its thermal image and similarly for other projects (starting from basics to advance). Since I am at beginner stage I am not sure how to implement these in either of the software.

Is there any help related to same I can avail?

Regards,
Prakash

Dear Members

We are moving our systems from Windows 7 to Ubuntu. However, we are facing
serious issues with internet connections dropping off frequently which is
pushing us to switch back to Windows 7. We found some solutions on the
internet applicable to realtek adapter, but still we have been unsuccessful.

Can someone from ilugc help us out. Our office is located in Kilpauk,
opposite Pachayappas College.

Subject: [Ilugc] bitcoin ramblings
Message-ID: <CALDskyziXfvmCnKHtU53Yd3KQLRNZr_uNgRw0+J+tQcEiu5dGQ@mail.gmail.com>

Bitcoin is becoming increasingly popular and until we learn it fast we
will end up receiving bitcoin money and we won't be able to withdraw
it.

I have seen a few youtube videos on this topic and I am not quite
familiar with bitcoin.

But I have enough data to make an ilugc post.

Here goes.

Apparently bitcoin is all about cryptography.

At least its implementation and advanced use requires you to
understand crypto, stuff like PKI, SHA256 message digest, fingerprint
and some math like zero knowledge proof and all that.

At any rate bitcoin is highly domain specific just like facebook is
about social behavior and human psychology.

Likewise bitcoin requires you to understand how a nation prints
currency and what gold and currency mean in the real world.

Since I have zero grounding in the world of money and currency note
dynamics I am not getting an idea of how bitcoin can serve as an
alternative to currency.

That way if you see even Paypal ain't a bank. I have sent and received
Paypal money and I know that it talks to banks.

Just like skype can talk to PSTN.

But bitcoin has nothing to do with banks or physical currency.

At least that is what I understand.

It can apparently serve as a real global currency and the transaction
fees are very low to facilitate funds transfer without commissions,
currency conversion charges, fluctuation in value of dollar etc.

Since we all are affected by dollar rate this is both a plus and a minus.

A plus because we are immune to it if bitcoin takes off which it already has.

And a minus because bitcoin rates are really volatile.

I was looking for a method to convert physical money into bitcoin
currency but that is not explained anywhere.

Okay then that is all I know.

I just did not want to end up with bitcoin in my name but without the
requisite know how and means to benefit by the cash. ;)

How many of you know that cash came from Tamizh kassu?

hi

iam using mint 15 oliva i coudnt update my system it is showing following
error

E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'
to correct the problem.

E: _cache->open() failed, please report







Anwat - Did you try entering the command as per the error instruction?
Open Terminal (Konsole if you are on KDE) and type the command 'sudo
dpkg --configure -a' and hit enter. It will prompt you for root
password and once you enter you should be good.


i have solved the as per mr .anand radha krishnan instruction

Glad to see that you have solved the problem, but don't start a new
thread with a different subject for each of your emails. You could have
replied to Anand Radhakrishnan's email, quoting appropriately so that a
future search of the mailing list archives will have information in a
single thread and also people will know that your problem was solved.

Also use the email quoting formatting provided by your email client
instead of copy pasting stuff which destroys the context on who said
what. For instance, the whole of the text I have quoted appears to be
said by you though it is not the case.

Do read about posting styles and quoting before you send your next email
to the list. Feel free to ask if you have any questions or doubts and we
will be glad to help.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

LocalBitcoins.com is a marketplace for trading bitcoins locally to cash or online payments of your choice.

Bitcon is cool stuff and has tuff competition with Paypal and other E-Commerece sites which uses CC / user's balance to do money transaction.

http://blockchain.info/wallet/paypal-vs-bitcoin

Clearly Bitcoin wins ......

How many of you would know that Visa is also trying to come in the same market - they have setup a development center at Chennai.

http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-ebay-uk-paypal-and-zynga-are-bringing-bitcoin-to-the-mainstream-1954321

Though Ebay abd Paypal are in plans to accep Bitcoins as a method of payments but they have a huge loss as the transaction would be very low.

Quote:

Bitcoin is a payment choice along with Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. ... ?Bitcoin is well suited for online transactions?

I have rather a question (dumb) - If Update Manager itself can recommend
the solution - why cant system apply the fix automatically? Maybe am
missing something and it is not a trivial implementation as it appears.
Note - Mint Update manager starts with root privileges so sudo rights is
not an issue.
Any thoughts? Especially folks who have experience with packaging.

https://github.com/linuxmint/mintupdate/issues/22 >> Meanwhile have raised
an issue here seeking clarity.

I arbitrarily choose this thread instead of the other one ;-)

= January Monthly Meet

== Date & Time

25 January
3:00pm to 5:00pm

== Venue

Zilogic Systems,
Fourth Main Road,
Kamaraj Nagar,
Thiruvanmiyur,
Chennai

Location map: http://www.zilogic.com/contact.html

== Agenda

Talk 1: Jenkins and Python
by Vijay Kumar
Duration: 30min

Jenkins is a continuous integration system. Jenkins has various plugins to
display results of Python unit tests, code coverage reports, style
violation reports, etc. This talk will discuss the various plugins and
demonstrate their usage.

Talk 2: Unit Testing with Mocks
by Manikandan
Duration: 30min

This talk will show how to use 'unittest.mock' to simplify unittesting
of modules that have complex behaviors like sending/receiving SMS,
email, sending/receiving data through serial port, etc.

The 'unittest.mock' module in the Python standard library allows
programmers to replace parts of the system under test with mock
objects. The programmer can configure the mock object to return
specific values, when a method is invoked. The programmer can also
assert if the mock object was invoked in a certain way.
Links: http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/unittest.mock

If you would like to give a lightning talk, just come prepared, we
will be able to accommodate you.

If you are new to Python, the tutorial at
http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/ will give you a quick
overview of what Python is all about.

Regards,
Vijay

Message-ID: <CAOdw4WsvHNLa=NYCJzQN_HSstWpRviVeN3Hv7K-VKGvJUf-PcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,


*First - the rant:*     I was driving by a Software Major's office today,
and saw a line of a few hundred youngsters waiting to get in for an
interview.

     It is true that the software industry needs thousands of youngsters,
but as a nation we have millions of them.

    Sadly everybody seems to have been boxed and packaged into one with the
engineering label. Some of these guys are artists, some are musicians, some
are accountants - by nature. But they wait in vain for a software job.

    OTOH, we are a growing nation, which can use some help. We need better
mechanics, better construction workers, more artistic output. There are
opportunities everywhere - one could start a company that supplies road
traffic management personnel, and this would be in high demand.

    We walk over slush, jump through gutters and enter a fancy office to
improve the lifes of humankind halfway around the globe, while our kids
suffer from diseases that could be prevented with sanitation improvements,
our parents struggle to cope up with the increasing cost of medical
facilities.

     I can go on and on. Am sure each of you will have your stories to
share.


*Can we do this?*
     Am wondering if we can provide counselling to these graduates and
realign them to solve some our nation's problems. I know its a tough
change, given the peer pressure we are under - we might even find some gems
to contribute to open source and get companies to sponsor them.

     What do you all think? I would be really glad if some of you can spend
some time with me on exploring this.

Sorry for replying to this mail as it is marked as [OT], as somehow my
reply is related to the topic of this thread.

The problem will never come to an end if the situation continues

2013 Regulation for CSE

http://www.annauniv.edu/cai13b/UG2013/CSE.pdf

Look at the end of the document (Note: in the last page).

The same old tools used in 2008 regulation is going to continue in the 2013
regulation.

2008 Regulation for CSE

http://www.annauniv.edu/cai13b/UG%20-%20PDF/CSE.pdf
(Refer page no.12 to 16 for Semester III to Semester IV)

Though the links points to 2013 regulation, actually it is 2008 regulation
without changes.

I share your concern, ...but I have stopped thinking about this since
whatever intellectual / arm chair debates we can have, we cannot change the
fundamental cause of this:

"No Pay parity"

In a family-centric society like ours, family responsibilities and
commitments almost always overshadow one's real passion. Money matters. If
and only if the other professions can provide parity in pay, people are
going to follow thier passion. It is a practical problem. There will be a
solution for this - but sadly it will be after a disaster. Once we have
practically all talented people absorbed into IT and ITES, our social
fabric will fail. That will be the time when pays will become equal.

Arun

Well said, Arun. thats exactly my concern. Even if we could bring out a few
of these talents back with some writing/counselling, it will make a big
difference to those guys.

Have you independently checked if the webcam and red5 are working?
Can you play the sample videos in red5 in a browser, and can you access the
webcam from another app?

This is a valid point. In a society where there is no social security net,
an individual will always strive to first achieve the most immediate needs
(food, clothing and shelter) first before striving for higher needs like
fulfilling his/her passions.

The question whether to go for engineering/arts/medicine/others is not
decided based on what the person wants to do, but rather on which field
promises the maximum income for the minimum resources/effort. Unfortunately
it is easier to tell these people to follow their passions but the economic
realities almost always takes them in a different direction.

When someone starts their career they would need financial security more
than anything else. Maybe once they are secure enough, having developed
enough conviction on their aspirations/need-of-society they might choose
it.

I won't ask others to put their career on what i deem as nation's problem.
Maybe if i am part of the solution might recommend to others. Also all they
might want is 9-5 job after all!

I think one can educate & expertise them either topic of their interest or which they want free 


This way they actually get expertise on the path they want to travel and opp. will be best suited when it comes to them ..

I think there is huge scope in almost all fields in India. Only thing is it
is not explored. It may be due to many reason including economic, peer
pressure, fear of success, force from society.

Just telling people to follow passion may not work. One has to become an
example first.

I remember the road not taken poem but Robert Frost...

ya prasanna its a valid point but just think of our engineering syllabus..

for DIPLOMA STUDENTS (DOT anna univ)  as changed the syllabus and they
included cloud computing,system administration lab that includes WIN
SERVER  2008 practicals and RHEL 5.8 praticals  even with SAMBA as exercise
only this year they included it...
 but  think about engineering,  same syllabus only the year of publishing
book is 2013 changed thats alll..........

TO SAY A REAL FACT..

my friend brother is studying in VELTECH they got campus interview.. the
first question TCS HR  asked is ANY ONE CERTIFIED IN SERVER ADMINISTRATION
EITHER WINDOWS OR LINUX ARE SPOT SELECTED TO PROJECT ..


but no one is aware about it but all are having marks above 90.......

but its only in the hands for engineers to fight in their own... they
should study more than book then sure they will be placed..

I don't think blaming syllabus has any use. It is about interest of
the students in learning things and the way things are thought. If
student is not interested in engineering there is no use in having a
good syllabus.

If anyone is certified in server admin they are spot selecting? So
just having a certificate matters more than have a skill / knowledge.
This is the sorry state of Indian IT services companies :(. I
understand what you want to explain but looks like your example went
wrong.

I met a couple of RHEL certified system administrators. They had a
laptop with RHEL (sad thing is it is a pirated copy), track pad was
not working in that. And both of them had no idea of what went wrong
or where to look. Looked like they did not even spend some in
searching the internet for solution. I feel this is the mindset of a
common engineering graduate towards learning. Part of the problem is
in the system and rest is with society and student.

May be if china catches up in software then Indian software companies
will be in a difficult state. If that happens things will change.
There will be chaos and difficulty for a few time but things will
settle and become better hopefully.

Thanks and Regards,
PrasannaKumar

Can you spot few organisations which offer them in India?

Even the likes of Infosys and TCS squeezes them especially after the
"honeymoon period" they usually are away from home for 12-14 hours.

Let's give the family overheads their due.

If due to family a project gets extended to 180% of estimated time, So be it.

India's cell of primary social fabrics is ones family and extended
family and workplace family.

I can  expound on this enough as I have invested enough time and
resources on all these aspects for over 30 years.

We cannot afford to be workoholics considering Indian Infrastructure
(family, relations, commuting, self development, laxity, etc. etc. ,
and the cost hence).

We just cannot implant the westen "Protestent Work Ethics" on Indians
as yet. (India had about1/3rd of word GDP till  17th CE, Now 3% after
imposition of the "western" ideas -- Angus Madison)

It simply reduces our natural productivity otherwise.

I have never seen that in other countries as they have it drilled in them.

Well said... My rant is that if all this hard work is spent on innovations... We would really benefit from all the advances... But all we have is another brain drain of sorts... Only that this time engineers get paid peanuts...

The govt spends money on education and growing the social security, while our engineers use their time and brains to develop Systems that benefit other countries.... I understand the foreign inflow benefit... But that's like selling ourselves cheap... Not a long term outlook...

Btw, does anybody Reply ilugc from their mobile? Is it not too hard to not top post from a mobile? Our its it just me?

M

9-5 is figure of speech, should have been more explicit.

Staying in line OP comments.

I try communicating my nephew the need of education, he is doing secondary
certificate. Education that helps one in life situations, education that
helps to achieve financial self-sufficiency. Earlier i was prejudice
towards former and my recommendations feel in deaf ear. When i am balanced
he atleast listens. When i am titled towards latter, everyone in my family
participates.

What do you want?

You want to get RHCE?

Who should give you reference?

This is a mailing list where people ask questions for which free help
is rendered
 when the question relates to people who have found similar problems
and solved them.

People should not be slaves of backward oppressive systems linked to
'family values' and such and should work towards changing them.
Always work as you want to and pursue your interests and not as per
the diktats of the corporatocracy.

Dear all,

FSFTN and EML Team, IIT Madras are organising a lecture in relation to the
Education Freedom Day programmes. The lecture is delivered by Prof. S. K.
Brahmachari, former DG of CSIR addressing the theme of the open innovation.
Prof. Brahmachari is the chief mentor of open source drug discovery, one
such initiative which focuses on developing drugs for diseases that affect
the third world, largely. Please find further details below:


*Extra Mural Lectures Team, IIT Madras and Free Software Foundation, Tamil
Nadu *

Present

an Extra Mural Lecture
 by


*Prof. Samir K. Brahmachari*
Chief Mentor for OSDD and Former Director-General of CSIR


On


*'**Open Innovation, Big Data and Crowd Sourcing : The Next Frontier *
*' *

*Tuesday, 28th January*

*Venue: IC & SR Main Auditorium*
*Time: 7.30 PM*

The phrase open innovation is used to refer to a development model first
came to the forefront with the advent of the Internet. The ideology,
pioneered by the development of the free and open source software movement,
has found considerable following in a variety of other fields, one of which
is drug discovery. Open Source Drug Discovery (OSDD), a research consortium
based in India, is one of the groups spearheading this developmental
philosophy, encouraging research in the spirit of free and open source
software. Their ambition is to provide affordable health services for all
by developing better treatment for diseases such as tuberculosis and
malaria that are often neglected by big medical companies.

Professor Samir K. Brahmachari is the Chief Coordinator and Mentor for the
OSDD. He is a biophysicist and the former Director General of the Council
of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR). He holds the distinction of
being awarded numerous national and international honours, and was named as
one of the 25 Most Valuable Indians by The Week magazine in 2009.*
?GNU/Linux?, ?Firefox? and ?Wikipedia? have taken the electronic world by
storm, and the field of drug discovery seems primed for such a revolution.
Do not miss out on this opportunity to hear from one of the pioneers of an
idea that could lead to very real and tangible benefits in India as well as
around the world.*

Is one not allowed to have a different point of view? Perhaps family values
would not allow it!! :)

        Of course they can have a different point of view. That's what
freedom is all about :). Just like  Mani feels family values are
backward(at least that's how I read that statement), in my opinion
calling family values "backward" doesn't make sense. Thanks

Site is
www.codelearn.org/android-tutorial

They ask users to download an Eclipse plugin for their tutorials which
is then used for tracking user errors and showing hints, which I think
is pretty cool.

You misread my statement.
I was referring to a class of 'family values' that are inherently
sexist, gender discriminatory, hetero-normative and serve the
patriarchy.
Given marriage equality, the concept of 'family values' is much broader.

@Mani,
I am completely in support of your community and your aspirations. I
believe in choice and equality in love. Don't take me wrong. But either you
did not read the whole thread or you are hijacking a thread towards
patriarchy and LGBT issues. The family values we are talking about is about
responsibilities of a young adult in a typical Indian family and nothing to
do with orientation.

Arun

Check your updated kernel for the wireless usb adapter support.

1. Look for the kernel module 'rtl8192cu.ko' in debian.  In fedora, it is
under

/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/rtlwifi/rtl8192cu/rtl8192cu.ko

2. cat /lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.alias | grep 0846 | grep 9041

post your results.

I am not hijacking the thread. I was pointing out that if we assume
infrastructure to include discriminatory dynamics,
then we will end up in aiding discriminatory practices. The local IT
industry in particular will end up losing too much of talent as a
consequence. I know about quite a number of cases.

for all i know its a competitive world. The rule of nature, even artists,
singers and other professions would also feel the heat of competition,
there is no one single solution. Passion works till it meets the ends,
otherwise it goes down into history.

Message-ID: <52E77C15.1090305@gmail.com>

Hello People,

Arguably  a top Rails company (100% pure services company) in Chennai, 
India wants me to recruit Ruby on Rails developers for them. I am not 
promising any good work or easy life or no politics. All I can say that 
is you might get a higher pay. Thats it. We want Rails developers for 
various caliber, as Coders, TL, PL, PM.

People with 1+ years of experience please apply. Freshers who have 
interest in web technology, who know HTML, CSS, JS nd possibly PHP / 
.NET / Java may apply too (but please start having a idea about Rails).

Please mail you resume to 77minds at gmail.com

Message-ID: <CAGvWd_uws9b7fxpZgkoaQZ3WsLzmKB_45q2vV7_Q-79s9Dheqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I was checking out anymeeting.com for organizing a free Drupal Webinar and
saw that the presenter cannot be on GNU/Linux although the viewers could
be. I then checked out gotomeeting.com and see that they also do not
support GNU / Linux for the presenter. Mikogo.com needs to dial in to a US
number for voice. Are there online webinar services that work with
GNU/Linux for the presenter (as well as for the participant) and that
allows all web presenting and viewing? I am alright with paying a monthly
fees as well.

Thanks in advance for your inputs.

Thanks
Anoop

Go to Training institute if you want to spend money and feel almost 
cheated. Most training institues don't have any stuff. Save that money, 
get good android online tutorial, study by your own. You will get it.

Hi Siva,

If you want to learn your own through videos here you go:

http://www.onlinevideolecture.com/computer-programming/slidenerd/android-programming-course-android-tutorials-for-beginners/?course_id=2369

If You have *Very Good Exposure in Core Java/OOPs* and want good Hands-on
training in Android Application Development then I recommend Bitcode
Technologies Pvt Ltd (http://www.bitcode.in/).

In Bitcode Technologies Android App Dev training is Hands-on, trainers are
having in depth knowledge.

NOTE: Last month I attended a corporate training program conducted by Bitcode
Technologies. It was was practical, hands-on. *Mr. Vishal Jagtap* expertise
in the subject and presentations skill are remarkable.


Thanks
Mohan L

Thanks Ganesh for the reply. I had checked out OpenMeetings but I was not
too keen on setting up and maintaining a full webinar server for me to run
an infrequent webinar. It would be easier and cheaper for me to rely on a
service provider.

It might be due to terminal width. Try setting it with os.environ. Also
popen is deprecated, use subprocess.

No you can't do it with PHP / MySQL.

Learn tools like Phonegap if you are targeting multiple platforms. Or 
try following Androids documentation if you just want to target andriod 
platform.

For all practical reasons no.
The next best thing if you want to use web technologies is Apache Cordova
(PhoneGap)
If you are not looking for multiple platforms with single effort (Android,
iOS, Windows Phone) there is nothing to beat developing apps using the
native SDK (Android/Java SDK from google)

Just for the sake of mentioning:
You could use the inbuilt webkit webview of the sdk and load your PHP/MySQL
application running on your server. Of coarse you will require an internet
connection to run this kind of an application.

 UK Government Leaves Microsoft Office For Open Source Technology!    *UK
government will save millions after this shift as the country has spent
over ?200 million on Microsoft's ubiquitous software suite in the last
three years.*
Rate this news:   (0 Votes)
*Thursday, January 30, 2014*:  In yet another blow to the proprietary
technology and boost to open source tech, UK government has now given up on
Microsoft's Office and is resorting to open source alternatives. The move
has come in order to restrict expenditure and put an end to 'oligopoly' in
the IT market.

According to reports, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude is working to
outline plans, to make the desired shift from Microsoft Office to free
productivity software such as OpenOffice and Google Docs. Maude shared an
update on the plans at a cross-government event. UK government will save
millions after this shift as the country has spent over ?200 million on
Microsoft's ubiquitous software suite in the last three years.
Maude said, "We know the best technology and digital ideas often come from
small businesses but too often in the past they were excluded from
government work. In the civil service there was a sense that if you hired a
big multi-national, who everyone knew the name of, you'd never be fired. We
weren't just missing out on innovation, we were paying top dollar for
yesterday's technology."

Office minister Francis Maude, Proprietary software, Open source technology]



The government believes that this will put an end to the 'oligopoly'
amongst suppliers of technologies. Maude said, "The software we use in
government is still supplied by just a few large companies. A tiny
oligopoly dominates the marketplace. I want to see a greater range of
software used, so civil servants have access to the information they need
and can get their work done without having to buy a particular brand of
software. In the first instance, this will help departments to do something
as simple as share documents with each other more easily. But it will also
make it easier for the public to use and share government information."

The government is already working in the direction. "We have been talking
to users about the problems they face when they read or work with our
documents - and we have been inviting ideas from experts on how to solve
these challenges. Technical standards for document formats may not sound
like the first shot in a revolution [...] but be in no doubt: the adoption of
compulsory standards in government threatens to break open Whitehall's
lock-in to proprietary formats. In turn we will open the door for a host of
other software providers," he stated.

msg["To"] is essentially what is printed on the letter. It doesn't actually
have any effect.

# single recipients,
s.sendmail(me, 'hariprasadh89 at gmail.com', msg.as_string())

# for Muliple recipients,

recipients = ['hariprasadh89 at gmail.com','ramesh at gmail.com','
example at gmail.com']
....
s.sendmail(me, recipients, msg.as_string())

Do you know in India there is almost no net neutrality and almost none 
knows about it? A citizen powered Internet, where every home has a 
router connecting to n - neighbors may be the answer. The truth is many 
Indians prefer buying gold than a computer for their home even today, so 
how can we educate people? So this net neutrality in India (forget the 
west) will always be a dream.

As part of Education Freedom Day celebrations, FSFTN members conducted a
session at Chennai Girls Higher Secondary School at Perambur,Chennai on
Friday, 24-01-2014.

The crowd comprised nearly 120 class XI students and K. Sibi, Executive
Committee member, FSFTN, took a 2-hour session. The students were from
Computer Science and Commerce groups.

The students showed great interest in learning new things and were a highly
inquisitive and responsive group. The depth of understanding and
perceptiveness they showed matched that of many engineering students.

Those students who asked good questions and of course, gave brilliant
answers were given short story books.

The topics covered were:
What is free software ?
How is it different from proprietary software?
The basic philosophy behind free software.

Due to time limitations, a hands-on session was not possible. However, the
students were very much interested in one and after discussion, it has been
decided to have a practical session next month.

FSFTN would like to thank Mrs. G.P Kamalavathy,  Head Mistress  of the
school. Mr. S.K Gulam Thasthahir , Asst.Head Master of the school had a
great contribution to make in the success of the session and FSFTN would
like to thank him too.

Mr.Tamizhmani, Computer science teacher of the school also helped with the
arrangement. FSFTN volunteers Suthir, Anupama and Nappinnai also
participated in
the session.
