Subject: [Ilugc] SAMBA PDC ROAMING PROFILE ERROR
Message-ID: <CADiLUEvqfswhngPy-fWvQ4mk4+MDh20HW7n_qbJ7b2vqcB8R4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Techies

I am running samba PDC on CentOS 6.3 . The windows xp could able to join as
member of the PDC domain.But could able to be a roaming profile.

My Doubt is should i have to do any patches in the registry of the Windows
XP ? Kindly help me clear this below error.





Your roaming profile is not available. You
are logged on with the locally stored
profile. Changes to the profile will not be

copied to the server. Possible causes of
this error include network problems or
insufficient security rights. If this problem


persists, contact your network
administrator.


Thanking you
C.V.Udayashankar

This list is not for cheapskates who do not want to shell out money
for proprietary software nor have the smarts to use free open source
alternatives. So, pls find someother place where you feel at home.

We are working regularly on spreading Free/Open Source Software.

We are against using proprietary software illegally.

Please dont ask/answer any such illegal questions.

Read the mailing list guidelines
http://ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines/

and remember those stuff while sending mails to our list.

One more thing Your mail has the tone and tenor of an order rather than a
request.

If it is a former, F***k you.

Members spend their valuable time in this list to help others.

What you are asking is asking members to commit a crime.

Best solution:
Stop piracy: Use Open source.

Period.

Yes, nobody stops anyone from contributing to FOSS projects, I shared my
experience above and I have heard similar from others too, we need to see
both sides of a coin and that is the reason why mentioned about this side.

+1.   This mailing list is all about Open Source.   It is also
archived publicly @ GMane etc.   This is *not* the place for

IMO, becoming a single-dimensional programmer is a bad idea. A good
programmer typically learns to code in multiple languages, understands
multiple programming paradigms and over a period of time assimilates the
fact that programming is not about syntax or about the features of any
given language or framework... and good programmers are always in demand
and easily identifiable by their approach to how they can design and reuse
systems.

So, sure, by all means if you are interested in learning perl please do so.
But, as the Buddha said, don't get attached to it.

Cheers,

+1.

It will help to choose feature reach programming language for the problem.

Hi,

I'm looking for simple games that can work without the need for GL / 3D

I apologise for the late reply.

I had spoken to KG in 2010 that I would be willing to help with the costs
of server hosting and also with development if a website were to be setup
for hosting data specific to India because the documentation available in
India is in such a deplorable state that hardly anyone is sure about
whether it is accurate or not.

If you go to a government department each person present there will have a
different idea of what the current policy is with respect to all sorts of
things.

About the software - I was considering something that allows both adhoc
unstructured document style data (wiki-style data) as well as structured
(read: columnar) data. A sort of a wiki but with the ability to host
searchable columnar data.

Taking about data, I am considering all sorts of data. Some example data:

a) Data on crime categorised by nature of crime in taluk, panchayat,
district, state etc.

b) Government schemes and policies across departments.

c) Government procedures and policies - example:
- What are the licenses and permits needed for setting up a restaurant
- How does one deal with the loss of a voter's id
- What are the banned fertilisers and agrochemicals, etc.

d) Contact numbers for various people in government and local bodies
Example: the contact numbers for the Additional Engineer, Lineman etc,
local beat constables/SI, municipal councilors, MLAs, etc all categorised
by locality.

e) Other example data:

- Prices of food, grain etc across time in different parts of the country

-  Native bird, animal and fish species in different parts of the country.
With the Pallikarnai marsh being actively destroyed by the government in
just a few years a lot of these native species in these marshes could
become extinct.

- Local utilities, libraries, parks, daycare centres, schools, colleges,
theatres, malls, PDS shops

- Places of interest - museums, beaches, sports clubs

- Dates and times for the local government meetings, panchayat meetings,
and other meetings open to locals.


This is just a sample.

There should be an ability to attach PDFs and other documents to all data
- example: application forms for various government departments.

Also, the policies and procedures should have support for it to be
ratified by one or more government officials to indicate that the data is
indeed correct. If the data is not ratified, it should be marked as such.

A more informal ratification by ordinary citizens who have actually
verified that the procedures/policies actually are correct should also be
provided.

Also, all procedures and policy documentation should have a counter which
indicates how long it has been since it has been updated - to indicate
that it may not be current. Once data goes past a threshold in terms of
"currentness", it should be marked as such and be brought to the attention
of moderators for review and updates or archival.

I was also considering building in moderated forums, and also having a
local petitioning system which will direct an email to be automatically
delivered to the correct authorities.

Also, if this could be developed with a web service API such that the data
can be queried remotely and also updated remotely it may be possible to
integrate this into existing solutions.

Example use cases:

- Local weather data from 2007 November 12 compared with today's data in a
desktop or mobile app.

- Compare data on the price of wheat in 2010 January vs today's data -
again in a desktop or mobile app.

- Take a picture of a fish on your mobile phone and upload it to the
website tagged under the name of a local fish species. This could then be
checked by moderators and experts and then either accepted into the
website or moved into a different section.

It is pretty ambitious but I am seeing it as a public utility and not a
commercial venture. Most of this functionality is already available in
Mediawiki, Alfresco etc, but it would be good to tie in Openstreetmap etc
into it and also include better tools for searching and querying columnar
data and ofcourse, there will be work required in developing a secure web
service layer which allows for API key generation (similar to Google map
API keys) etc, different levels of access, moderation etc.

Apart from the software development work, considerable work needs to go
into getting content and keeping it current. All software that needs to be
developed should be developed as open source and so yes, something like a
hackathon by FOSS enthusiasts would definitely help.

Prem Kurian Philip

Whose future? Your future? Your company's future? Your enemy's future?

Anyway it took me 3 years to learn perl. So that is a piece of data
you may not know.

And perl is a nice handy language because of the rich repertoire of
tools in CPAN.

You can do just about anything in perl as long as you know UNIX rather well.

I learnt UNIX in not less than 10 years.

why when we have a platform like data.gov.in , also the software is
available https://github.com/opengovplatform/opengovplatform-beta, can you
repost your mail on to http://datameet.org/discussions/ , we can talk more

Hi all,

[Forwarding the reminder mail 'ashwin kesavan' used to send]

This is the monthly reminder mail to ILUGC users to remind them of
guidelines to follow while posting on ILUGC (found at
http://ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines/ ). New members are requested
to go through the following page also for better communication at
ILUGC http://ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines/mailing-list-etiquette/

Mailing List Guidelines
========================

1. English is the medium of communication in this mailing list, so use
only english in the mailing list. For people wanting to expressing
themselves in Tamil, ILUGC?s Tamil mailing list exist. For joining ILUGC
Tamil:
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/listinfo/ilugc.tamil

2. Use a proper subject line.

3. Do not troll in the mailing list
Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll

4. Use [OT] for off-topic, non-technical discussions. But, don?t misuse
this to start flame wars or to troll in the mailing list.

5. Do not top-post:

Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting

Example of a top-post:

> > Why is top-posting
> > such a bad thing?
Top-posting.
> > What is the most
> > annoying thing in e-mail?

Use interleaved, trimmed posting

Hi,

Sure.

> CTAN doesn?t seem to give me anything.

Check this example (Observing Time Application Form):

http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/observing/applicationForms.php

?
Bar Foo

6. Do not over-quote:

Example of an over-quote:

>>> On Friday you said
>>> blah blah blah
>> On Saturday you said
>> foo foo foo
> On Sunday you said
> foobar

7. Do not post HTML messages

8. Do not recycle messages

9. Do not send attachments

10. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal disclaimers. If your
company uses disclaimers, don?t use your company ID for the mailing list.

11. Do not reply to a digest. (If you are in digest mode and want to
reply to a post use ILUGC Gmane blog interface.
Link:

http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

12. Search for answers for your questions/problems in any search engine
before posting your query to the mailing list.

13. Do not post messages in all capital letters. Mails in CAPS is
considered rude and is similar to shouting during a conversation.

14. Following these guidelines could be helpful

http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

15. Don?t send season?s greetings or birthday or social networking site
invites to the group. Its not mailing list etiquette.

We must use the above guidelines to maintain better readability, proper
archives, efficient bandwidth usage.

Ah! good. Thank you for sending this link. I wasn't really aware of the
opengovplatform. I don't recall reviewing that software in 2010.

Seems pretty neat, but yes, I have some ideas as to how it could be
improved. Will continue the discussion at http://datameet.org/discussions.

Subject: [Ilugc] file editing with perl Tie::File
Message-ID: <CALDskyzi0Q4paKnXShmu8TTpA+aHSjLzZSmPGdMEOfCgw-6s6w@mail.gmail.com>

Perl is my favorite.

Not because of any other reason that is meaningful and convincing.

I had to learn perl for my job in 2002.

And I gradually developed a liking for it. Today I do all my CGI,
daemons, important
 coding work in perl. C is also there, but much more perl than C.

I do plenty of file editing in perl.

Always configuration files that are used either by my own C or perl
code or some other application's
 configuration files need to be edited.

Instead of hand editing a web interface is given where the user
chooses based on text input, drop down
 menus, select boxes, radio buttons or text area widgets.

The user's intention which is presented in plain English in the way
the user understands have to be
appropriately translated in a manner machine understands.

Perl would do this even without any outside help. But a module called
Tie::File that is installed with
 standard perl helps us do simple file edits and even complex edits.

Usually I resort to using a perl function called splice() that is
somewhat messy but gets the job done.

It turns out perl does not have very many useful ways to manipulate arrays.

Tie::File is a handy way to convert all lines of a file into a perl
array and you can directly
 modify the perl array which can be "untied" and all changes are
written back to a file.

A simple example is :

$ cat fileedit

use Tie::File;

tie @farr, "Tie::File", "/home/foo/file.txt";

for(@farr) {
    chomp();
     if(/search/) {
               print "String found\n";
     }
}
@farr = @farr[0..20];
untie @farr;

Here we not only print a line by searching,we also
 truncate the file to 21 lines.

Tie::File is a useful way to do configuration file editing.

Usually configuration files are organized linewise.

But certain sections are also found. In order to do that you have to do some
 more low level perl coding.

Message-ID: <CAPV1RACv7FAmpYV8twDh=Q=KdFCKGPSsjQ+fZ2vmEcMRZurBrQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Recently I got into trouble when an useless repairman damaged my sony
vaio's laptops's  keyboard strip attempting to open it. Because of the
damage, the keyboard and keypad are not working as the strip connects both.
I only realized recently how  difficult is it to get this spare part
replaced and I am not finding it.
Could someone help me out if I can find it in chennai? or anywhere else ?
My lap-top model is  13.1"  Sony vaio VGN-Z12GN (model no. PCG-6XGP)
running ubuntu.

Thanks a lot!
Regards,
KM

Find a Sony service centre, hopefully they should be able to help you
to get a replacement.

Subject: [Ilugc] How to get all the posts URL from a blog?
Message-ID: <CAND2797hdzN8dc=pfj4vr3ves8srOiRkY6zyQ_ZmjUew35VYgQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on creating Free Tamil Ebooks to read in kindle or tablet devices.

Read more here on how I am doing manually.
https://onroads.wordpress.com/2012/11/23/how-to-read-tamil-books-in-kindle-ebook-reader/

We have to copy the content from various websites/blogs and paste in
libreoffice write to generate pdf files.

To automate this, I wrote a script, which can read the links from a
text file, download them all, clean them all,
merge them into single html file.

Then, I convert the html into odt using xhtml2odt tool.

Here is my script.
https://github.com/tshrinivasan/html2odt

Now, I am stuck with the process of collecting links and storing in a text file.
This is a manual process.

How can we automate this?

For example, I want to get the URL of all the posts from a blog.

Example.
http://kaniyam.com
or
http://365process.blogspot.in/


How can we get the URL of all the posts?

For blogs, and websites created using blogging software, you can access 
all current and upcoming(future) links via RSS feed no? Not sure if RSS 
will fetch info from archives.

Just check at  A related URL link - 
http://fskrealityguide.blogspot.in/2009/02/fsk-asks-fetching-old-items-on-rss-feed.html 
- RSS doesnt give older feeds, but you can get around this on wordpress 
and blogger based sites by manipulating the URL parameters(pageid,etc)
sharing what crossed my mind.

Dear All,

Few weeks back, your valuable comments helped us come out with an
interesting article on rooting one's Android device. We are back with a
story idea and would really appreciate if you chip in and share your
views on this. So the story idea goes like: How
important are FOSS certifications when it comes to the job market?
Please let us have your insightful suggestions on the same.

Looking forward to see some great takes...

Thanks and Regards,

      o Reading and composing mail
      o Browsing the web

Hi,

Thanks for the info but it unfortunately wasn't helpful.

When I tried using global proxy settings or HTTP settings the connection 
failed with
the error as "SSL connection failed" yet again. On opening the debug 
window, I saw
that pidgin was blocked by the hproxy saying 433 tunnelling is forbidden.

Cheers,
Abraham

You can use vim as an IDE that smart UNIX people want.

Not some Windows ordinary souls wanting hand holding all along the way.

You can:

:make

You can

:cn

for going to the next error, warning and so on.

Vim , make and UNIX shell make it an ideal IDE.

Vim's syntax highlighting, editing capabilities, quick productivity improvements
 you can have with 3 years of learning all make it the world's best editor.

However all this is beyond the pale of beginners and people used to
 graphical UIs that squeeze our one's brains and independence.

Any specific reason you do not want to use XCode IDE? The iPhone SDK is
designed to be used with it...

If you do want to develop iPhone apps in Linux, it is no easy task. But if
you are ready for the challenge, take a look at:
http://www.pjtrix.com/blawg/2009/07/21/iphone-development-on-windows-linux-with-open-source-tools/
It involves cross compilation, download of headers from the iPhone, MAC
development kits and probably violations of tons of licensing terms.

If you do manage to build apps with an open source tool chain, please share
the experience.

Arun Venkataswamy

I am assuming that you don't want to use XCode. Is that because of
cost? You may want to check Xamarin Studio if you intend to create
apps in C#

The number of IDEs with libre licenses who are built to work with the
SDK for iOS is extremely constrained, there's not much by way of
choice.

     If you are unable to understand, allow us to take the initiative of
explaining you again. As an initiative to promote FOSS in  the Indian
community, we have done and have been
     doing a number of articles in our publication and on our website.
The interesting part is that we ask the esteemed members of the LUG
community  to share their thoughts on a
     story idea so that we incorporate their suggestions (which are
indeed enriching) and come out with a good story. In a way, we put in
our best to bring real and live information to our
     readers, who are also FOSS enthusiasts. If you have been actively
following the  posts, you will chance upon a post wherein we have asked
our cherished LUG members to share
     their views on a story based on Rooting your android phone. We did
get a lot of interesting takes from them and that helped us in coming
out with an article. Here is the link:
     http://www.linuxforu.com/2013/03/to-root-or-not-to-root/. So, this
time we are doing a story on how important are certifications related to
open source when it comes to
     employability. We would really appreciate if you also let us have
your views on the same.  Please feel free to write back if you have any
queries.
 
     Regards,
     Priyanka

Hi, 

>  How important are FOSS certifications when it comes to the job 
>  market?

Here are couple of my thoughts in this regard (and please be kind
on my typos and possible grammatical errors):

Certifications are useful in the field on Systems and 
Network Administration in general. In relation of FOSS, there are
numerous certification programs provided and supported by companies 
and their partnered vendors. For instance, there's RedHat Certified 
Engineer (a.k.a RHCE) program by RedHat Inc (and there are many more
similar certifications by RedHat), Ubuntu Certified Professional by
Canonical Software, Novell Certified Linux Engineer (NCLE) 
by Novell Inc., LPI series of certifications from Linux Professional 
Institute.

Most of the above certifications cater to administrators. This makes
sense because, administrators are employed in companies that span 
beyond IT domain (banks, hospitals, schools for instance). However, 
it might be a little difficult for recruiters from non-IT organizations to 
evaluate or gauge the skill-sets and technology competency of 
candidates that they might be recruiting as administrators; 
especially in current times where FOSS technology awareness among 
non-IT sectors are still low. Certifications from a reputed 
institute or a company would go a long way in boosting the 
recruiter's confidence on the candidate's skills.

IMHO, it makes no sense in getting certified as a developer 
or a programmer. Certifications that cover programming languages and 
application/web development frameworks are merely an eye-wash. Most 
candidates who get recruited in these domain are generally 
interviewed and evaluated by a technically competent personnel 
(preferably a tech-lead or a hired technical consultant) in at-least 
one of the evaluation spins. Certifications might not necessarily 
help in improving the employability of the candidate in this regard.
Programmers and developers are best evaluated based on their
track-record and their problem analysis and problem-solving skills.

Having said that, developer/programming certification if taken 
seriously by the candidates would help them in learning the 
technology well, though it might not guarantee their employability.

I don't know what wireless device to buy for linux, But I know what
device not to buy, don't ever think about broadcom.

Sometimes I get details from linuxwireless.org. Here is one list you can
take a look at,

http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Devices/PCI

Linux have atheros driver in mainline (ath9k). But I didn't get a chance
to use atheros product. If someone is using it, please give your review.

By the way, broadcom is not that bad if you install their binary-only
driver (wl - comes with broadcom-sta package in most of the distros).
I'm using broadcom and sometimes its irritating to stop loading b43
drivers and enable wl driver. I was informed that b43 driver works great
with some broadcom cards, but it never worked for me.

OK, I think this is about certification, personally I think 
certification does no good. All boils down to ones interest. I have seen 
people shfowing they are certified in this or that and they are junk. 
Other people are genuinely interested in technology and they don't care 
about employment, money, pride and blah bah. Its that kind of people I hire.

In fee software world I don't think certification is important as all 
knowledge is free. Any one having the interest can learn it. And free 
software is not about money or employment.

This is remarkably graceless.

Priyanka did clarify (in response to a question I had) that the
article is about the relevance of certifications when candidates are
evaluated for opportunities in open source technologies. That is a
paraphrase of what she said (her exact statement is in the archives).
I do think it is a good initiative that inputs to an article are being
solicited and, crowd-sourced. It provides EFY/LFY with an opportunity
to identify voices as well as helps establishing a relationship that
is not based purely on "commissioned pieces". At some point perhaps it
would also help in pitching ideas for articles and features.

I would refrain from opining on whether certifications are useful or,
otherwise. My employer offers a fairly well-known and diverse set of
training offerings and, it would be difficult for me to keep adding
caveats for everything I say.

However, consider this aspect - employers are commercial entities who
provide services against contracts. Contractual obligations require
that a specific set of skills be certified by passing an examination.
And, hence, there is a reason why employers do put some emphasis on
certifications and, their ratings.

This is not limited to IT. Consider for a moment the medical and
health services industry - you have certifications. Or, traditional
engineering - you have certifications there too.

So, if you do have a generic statement along the lines of
"certification is useless and junk", that fallacy needs to be tested.

If your intention is to develop an "app" for iOS, unless you need the
native OS's features a lot, you can develop a HTML5/CSS3/Javascript based
app and get it to run on the iOS platform. What more, using this approach
you will be able to write code once and be able to run it on multiple
mobile platforms without having to write code specific to each platform. To
me, this is a huge win - especially when I would just like to "test" a
product/concept and refine it. It is also a huge win because from the
beginning you get to develop a web-accessible version of your application
that can be accessed even from a desktop machine. This inclusiveness, I
like!

I found http://trigger.io to be the most pain-free way to achieve this
using the HTML5/CSS3/Javascript approach - the reason this works is because
most modern mobile platforms have a WebKit or equivalent that supports
HTML5 specifications. The typical "Conventional" way to achieve this is to
use PhoneGap / Apache Cordova project - but I have found setting up
PhoneGap to be a pain (actually I couldn't - I gave up after 1 hour of
"trying") and trigger.io Just Worked!

Trigger gives a python tool that can run on GNU/Linux. The tool will submit
your code to trigger.io servers, generates a build out of it and downloads
the build. Then you can 'run' the build. If you have a device connected, it
will load it into the device or, where applicable (like with Android)
trigger will start the emulator if you have installed the Android
Development Kit. However, for iOS, you will still need and iOS device like
an iPad or iPhone.

There are other alternatives to trigger like sencha or even many so called
'do-everything-on-the-cloud' services like Tiggzi, etc.,  I haven't tried
those (I tried sencha and found their 'free' version too restrictive to try
out what I wanted to do and ExtJS is a whole framework I'm yet to wrap my
little head around) and I found Tiggzi and their ilk to be targeting
"developers" who don't want to write any code.

If your intention is to develop "games" or other such "multi-threaded"
stuff, then a Javascript based app may quickly turn into a bottleneck and
will have visibly poorer performance (unless you are a JS guru or have a
team of JS gurus... like Rovio*). In such a case, the best bet would be to
develop a native iOS (or android) app. However, if all you need is a decent
user interface, then Jquery Mobile / Zepto / etc., can be of help and may
be a smarter thing to do especially if the 'solution' you are providing
involves the Internet (ie., the mobile device is just the "user interface"
while the 'brain' of your app sits on the cloud).

* It is worth noting that the famous AngryBirds also has a HTML5 version
but it still doesn't work as smoothly as the native version of AngryBirds
(unless one possess a high spec device). So, writing native apps has its
uses - but I'm assuming 80% of typical "app" development needs can be met
using the HTML5 approach. YMMV.

Cheers,

I would like to arrange a competition of certificated ppl against the

are junk. 99.999% of it . Even most people having engineering degree are 
junk. Perhaps we should rename certification program as justification

massacre of technology / love for knowledge right in front of my eyes.

And, what would that prove ?

Let me clarify this line of thought you have proposed - "almost all IT
industry certifications are junk". Wherein one can infer that there is
a small slice of certifications which are not "junk". Could you point
those out ? I'm certain that they'd be interesting in context of the
article.

Now, you follow that statement with "most people having engineering
degree are junk". So, how do you validate who are not "junk" ?

I am tempted to say "One swallow does not a summer make, nor one fine
day; similarly one day or brief time of happiness does not make a
person entirely happy." But then again, you do have the chance to
posit Zoho as the black swan.

Certifications can help in situations where employers want to employ
people for the sake of demonstrating the existence of infrastructure
in their organization. In these situations "under-qualified otherwise"
but "certified" people can be paid less for more work.
Competence may not come into the picture and certifications can have a
face-saving value.
It happens in private universities.

FOSS is extensively used in Internet-based companies. I worked at Yahoo!,
Amazon and InMobi and have been doing business with many startups in the
Internet space - such as Flipkart, Exotel, etc., as a Talent sourcing
consultant. What we see as a common theme across all such companies' hiring
policy is they give preference to those who are self learners than those
who do certification courses. With all due respect, I can also vouch for
the validity of this policy that we "typically" come across shallower
engineers when we see a "certification logo" in their resumes. Not to say
all those who do certification courses are of poor quality - but the
difference is wide and obvious.

Most companies these days are also beginning to be open about what they
look for in a person when hiring - they don't care if someone has a "B.E."
degree or not - nor do they care if they cleared their exams. What they
really care about is "Can you think? Can you do?".

Bulk hirers have to be `scaleable'## -- so they use such 'metrics'.  They
need to merely ensure that
those who hire are not below their set bar.

People who hire smaller numbers tend to focus on skills and look for those
who are above their bar
and try to figure out means to identify key skills reliably.

If it's a ext3 partition, you can try using ext3grep [1]. I have got

Message-ID: <CANSdqMq7SM59H+d77hovALp_9e9kK_266s7j+zteEH_YBgAmww@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I need a help regarding creating a query in Libre Office Base.

Suppose I have two tables A and B each having few columns (identical in
headings). Both the tables are linked by a common primary key (ID No).

Table A is completely filled while Table B has only few data filled.
(though all records  are equal)

Now, I wish to write a query that could do the following:
* If Value B is not blank (or less than 1), Take Value B
* If Value B is blank, Take Value A
* Input the result into another table/ query.

For instance,

Hey Friends,

I?m about to complete my final year project based on Linux. In that I am
trying to initialize communication between two systems on the network.

To begin this process, one needs to do encryption and decryption algorithm
using the Shell script.

It?d be highly grateful on your part if you kindly help me by giving ideas.



Awaiting a positive reply from you.



Thank you.

This sounds like you have already completed or a last minute effort for
help from this group , if you have already some work where is the code ?

Until here everything sounded fun and cool.

These four words ruined it for me. Either I am understanding wrong or your
approach is wrong. You *never *use shell script to implement cryptographic
algoritms. You can use it to chain together an array of tools to accomplish
your goals.

Like others have mentioned, take a look at openssl.

Javascript is a very nice and complex language.

You have to learn closures and jQuery.

For me learning it was very tough but I got there.

You have to learn CSS, DOM of HTML, HTML and few other related areas.

It can be quite daunting and boring in the beginning but with lot of
hard work you can
 get there.

It took me not less than 2.5 years if I remember right.

I started learning it only in 2009 or so.

I haven't seen a non junk certificated candidate yet. But there should

Not sure I'd recommend W3Schools.com. It has no affiliation with W3C
in any way. The quality of their tutorials is not very good as well.

I would unreservedly suggest Flanagan's 'the rhino book'. The first 20
chapters are absolute necessity if you want to make a career out of it. IMO
its a good general programming book which happens to use javascript!.

You may also simultaneouly read through Javascript - The Good Parts, a
shorter book.

More than the above two, lots of practice writing code :-)

Rest assured it will attract a lot of career opportunities in the
foreseeable future.

Message-ID: <CACtiFJaAgCSKFq41M2QmHoWWCzt1Rdo0d65NPQOBEogi+Xozcg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Two days Faculty Development Program on FOSS was organised by Dhaanish
Ahmed College of Engineering (http://www.dhaanish.in), Padappai,
Kanchipuram Dt. on 08/03/2013 and 09/03/2013.

The following topics were covered

The need of FOSS in Engineering Education
Fedora-18 Installation
Network Configuration
Package Management using RPM / YUM
Introduction to FOSS Applications
Introduction to GCC and GNU Toolchains (gcc, make, gcov etc)
Version Control System using Subversion (SVNEdge)

Totally 27 participants from the Dept. of CSE/IT/MCA attended the FDP.

In the end of the program, Principal requested the Dept. HODs and staff
members to move away from Proprietary OS/Applications and migrate all labs
to GNU/Linux.  Soon this institution will be migrating most labs to
GNU/Linux.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank Dhaanish Ahmed College Management and the
following persons for organizing the FDP.

Dr. Nalini Joseph - Principal
Mr. G.A.Senthil - HOD/CSE
Mr. ArunKumar - AP/CSE

 There have been sporadic flame on this list regarding your activities. But
IMO what you are doing is perfectly fine and even good for the community.
But just to caution you, it would be better you do not use ILUGC's name in
this as it looks like it has ILUGC's sanction - *u*nless it actually does
have, that am not aware of!

Not to forget that, most colleges in TN have been watching the ILUG-C
mailing list and most enquiries from colleges for conducting Workshop/FDP
comes after reading my mails posted in ILUG-C.  So, I don't see anything
wrong in using the name of ILUG-C in my post and I am also a long time
member of this list promoting FOSS and ILUG-C activities in colleges.

Message-ID: <1362846551.20895.25.camel@mohanlaptop.silentcrooks.org>

Remember Jurassic Park?? and that moment the girl say these words??

"Its a Unix System!! I know this"

Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=fvwp&NR=1&v=dFUlAQZB9Ng

The comments section on Youtube reveals that the girl is actually
navigating one of Unix's experimental File Manager called FSN (File
System Navigator) developed for IRIX by SGI
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fsn).

FSV (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_System_Visualizer) was a project
inspired by this Jurassic Park scene and written with gtk 1.2 and opengl
(some old version). Two years back, I was trying to compile Fsv on
linux, but not able to do so, but now, someone spent his time and bring
back Fsv to life and put his work on github.

https://github.com/mcuelenaere/fsv

I tried this and was able to see my directories in Fsv, I hope you can
also have fun with Fsv.

Thanks,
Mohan R

+1 Actually Baskar is kind enough to inform us of all the activities
he performs in the colleges regularly .  Most of his workshops as  far
as I know would have some community members participating in the
events .

We should all encourage such business model over FOSS which baskar has
been successfully running .

Message-ID: <CAFe1ooLtqLD-rBbSSgL29_PBcoE0ZD+UvLBH5rN_zm7Ay=rW5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I had a seemingly simple problem till I started the implementation.

I have two GNU/Linux servers, one in Erode and another one in Coimbatore -
both inside respective LANs which is connected to the internet. I also have
one VPS server (Linode) running with a static IP connected to the internet.
Now, I have to sync two folders - one in the Erode machine and the other
one in the Coimbatore machine. Files can get added and deleted in each of
the folders. At any given time, the Erode machine's folder should contain
all the files added by both Erode users and Coimbatore users. Same
expectation on the other side also. The project is a hybrid content
management system. Latency is not an issue. It can even take an entire day
to sync the two folders.

Based on my research the Unison project (
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/) seems to fit very well in the
star topology.

Any comments? Any better tool to achieve this? Am I in the right path?

Arun Venkataswamy

Simple rsync tool should be sufficent. It can operate over ssh and sync 
only the differences. Thus saving you time and bandwidth. But afaik it is 
a command line tool and i am not if any GUI wrapper tool exists. The 
biggest plus is all Linux system have it. cron job a rsync with ssh keys 
and your job is done.

The advantage unison would provide over rsync is bi-directional mirroring.

To my knowledge, rsync works great with unidirectional updates. I guess
there are options for update and delete, but I have doubts regarding
working with two masters. I would be very happy if there is some method in
which I can use just rsync. Love that tool.

GUI is not an issue. In fact both the systems are servers and I have not
even installed X windows.

rsync will be first back up tool u want to consider. But in your case
there are more things to worry about. Your internet connection more
specifically, do you have static ip at both ends or do u get assigned
dynamic ips on each connect. If so you may need to do some dirty work
to keep track of your changing ips

Yes I have that problem.
The IP addresses of the internet connections of the two machines will keep
changing, and they are also behind a modem connected to the LAN. That's the
reason I would like to use a `client initiated` solution. I have a 3rd
machine with a static IP on the internet which can act as a passive/bridge
between the 2 servers.

I do not know much about unison to comment on it, but your 3rd machine
is boon for you. You do not need to make it as a bridge between the 2
servers. But you can use it to keep track of your ips. You can
overcome the problem of being behind the router by setting up port
forwarding in the routers.

I think it should be possible to document all the steps in the process.
OP has not yet replied. It will help if somebody else chips in.

I am a teacher (Professor).  I am also a serious and committed

As part of my responsibilities at Kathmandu Univ,  where I teach
cryptography and security, I plan to set up a lab for security related
experiments. It will consist of a LAN with a https server connected to
the web. People can try different kinds of attacks and coutermeasures
etc, in a controlled, "real-time"  environment. Do you know anyone who
has set up something similar ? Can you connect me to that person ? I
would also like to visit Chennai sometime, and see some institutions
which do such kinds of things. Can you suggest some institutions (and
contact person) ? Any other suggestions in this matter will also be most
welcome. Tell me which period is best for all this.

Of course, I do not want doze users to bother about this mail.

Please respond directly, off the list. Sometimes I miss the messages
which I receive from this list, in digest form.

Dear all,

Thanks  for your replies.
I need to host these repositories locally  and I see the web interface of
git is closed source. I will not be able to host them online on github.com.

I have tried gitlabhq but the got stuck with ruby/gems configuration. There
are very few git-web-intefaces with user authentication built in.
I have been playing with gitblit based on java but its heap size cannot be
more than system memory.
Fish eye is  excellent but is again closed.
Any thoughts ?!

Regards,
KM

Try cgit(http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/about/). cgit is web interface (cgi)
for git repositories, written in C
licensed under GPLv2. I am using gitolite for access control and  cgit web
interface.

I will recommend you build tunnels (recomend OpenVPN)  from each of your
machines to the third machine with IPs in the same subnet with forwarding
enabled on the 3rd machine. The tunnel end points will have statically
assigned private addresses thus resolving your issue.

As a general rule, I'd think that certifications around "functional skills"
may be of value to the Industry (ex: PCI compliance, ITIL, etc.,). I've
seen some service companies value such certification. A rare exception:
Amazon Bangalore hired one PCI guy (but he was a pure PCI "product manager"
- not a techie with PCI-too certification) in order to build Flexible
Payments Service.

What he means to say is Zoho turned things upside down by hiring rural folk
and trains them in-house on PHP/MySQL/etc.,. It challenges the fundamental
mindset that "engineering graduates (starting from IIT and _below_) are
better" - but, IMO, this changing (Zoho) trend is already widespread. I run
a business which finds raw talent (people with computer programming / open
source inclination) and incubates them by providing inspiration / guidance
and infrastructure (specifically free access to AWS). When they have built
something worthwhile to be showcased, we place them at internet-tech
companies (like InMobi, Flipkart, etc.,). Some of these companies have
specifically asked us to NOT go to engineering colleges because they have,
out of experience, found better quality Arts & Science graduates! We
instead tell these companies to keep their mind open and hire only those
who pass their (usually very tough and long) technical interviews.

Cheers,

dear bhaskar,
continue the good work.
as you might have noticed, most of the students use turbo c, though i keep
hearing from many lecturers that they have to motivated to shift to gcc.

as usual, a sizeable number of lecturers themselves need to be
educated/encouraged.
And the students rarely listen to the teachers -- but talks from experts
like you might have a bit better impact.

i presume you must already be doing it -- but can make some additional
pitch to use the foss alternatives, esp., gcc, libre office, etc.

thanks and best wishes
Srinivasan.

I conducted hacks against web pages and defended them . I don't really 
understand on what granularity you are talking about. Any thing, even  
apiece of embedded hardware can be hacked. In short no system is 100% safe.

Orthogonal to your request, I'd suggest leveraging Amazon's "VPC" and
Amazon's EC2 to achieve this: Since all these services are highly
configurable APIs you will be able to create restricted multi-node networks
and be able to open it up for potentially the entire world to play with.
Since AWS has the notion of a "machine image" you can have pre-configured
vulnerable (or secure, as is the use-case) vulnerable machine images that
get booted up on demand for as many people as you want. Amazon also
provides many other controls that may not be possible in real world
computers - such as being able to restrict uptime or restricting whether
the state of a machine must be saved or not, etc.,.

Above all, since you are doing it for an educational purpose, it will be
possible for you (with some "rewording" of your intent) to leverage
Amazon's Education grant to fund the needed resources. You can get your
students to develop this system itself and in the process also give your
students a much sought after skill. Even if the grant is not possible, AWS'
"Spot instances" is a unique concept that bodes very well during Indian
timezone and especially for this "use and throw" stateless machines
use-case -- you can get fully functioning internet servers for as little as
(as of yesterday's AWS market pricing) $0.005 per hour (25 paisa / hour? :)
).

= Document Freedom Day: 2013 Event registration now open =

[Read online: http://fsfe.org/news/2013/news-20130226-01.en.html ]

Today event registration opens for Document Freedom Day 2013, March
27th. Local teams can add details of their activities to
DocumentFreedom.org[1], and have them marked on the global campaign
map[2].

Last week 50 promotional packs were dispatched to hackerspaces to kick
start event preparations. They contain posters, fliers, stickers, and
advice, including how to apply for financial support. Packs are now also
available to order online.

"Last year trail-blazing Open Standards advocates introduced thousands
of people to better standards" said Sam Tuke, Campaign Manager. "Teams
now have more resources at their disposal, and fresh ideas including
switching from Adobe Flash to HTML5 technologies".

"Markets for digital products such as audiobooks and cloud documents
have grown dramatically in recent months, but without Open Standards
customers are victims of vendor lock-in and anti-consumer market
control" said Erik Albers, Community Manager, Free Software Foundation
Europe.

This year the campaign aims to have more events, in additional
locations. In 2012[3]groups of volunteers ran 54 events in 23 different
countries, including Brussels, Colombia, and Indonesia.

== About Document Freedom Day ==

  Document Freedom Day (DFD) campaigns to celebrate information
  accessibility and introduce non-technical audiences to Open Standards.
  Open Standards are a basic condition for freedom and choice in
  software; ensuring the freedom to access data, and the freedom to
  build Free Software to read and write information. Started in 2008,
  the campaign last year had 54 events worldwide. It will happen on 27th
  March.

Subject: [Ilugc] CERT Advisory : SSHD root kit targeting Linux Systems
Message-ID: <513E09BF.20601@gmail.com>

QUOTE

Attacks through SSHD root kit targeting Linux Systems
http://www.cert-in.org.in/

It has been reported that a USER-mode root kit is in the wild targeting
major Linux flavors (majorly RPM based) which logs user names and password
pairs that are sent to the network and sent across the attacker controlled
domains  randomly generated- and additionally opening a backdoor onto
the system.

The rootkit apparently replaces the library libkeyutils with a trojanised
version as

"	/lib64/libkeyutils.so.1.9 (64bit)
"	/lib/libkeyutils.so.1.9 (x86).
It changes the links lib64/libkeyutils.so.1 (and /lib/libkeyutils.so.1 to
point malicious library therafter.

The malware is capable of:
"	stealing passwords, ssh keys & /etc/shadow from the system and sent to
remote IP hard coded in the file
"	used as a backdoor to access server at any time
"	sending out spam mails

Detection

The library is normally found in /lib (/lib64)and hence can be traced by
the package manager and possibly outputs "file /lib64/libkeyutils.so.1.9 is
not owned by any package" for apparent rooted box.
"	For instance:
on RHEL
rpm -qfV /lib*/libkeyutils* /(file /lib64/libkeyutils.so.1.9 is not owned
by any package---this is a symptom )


"	Debian /ubuntu ( not reported as of now)

dpkg -l libkeyutils*
dpkg -L libkeyutils* (list the files associated with)


"	 The malicious library has specific network related strings embedded
which can be verifed by using the 
strings /lib64/libkeyutils.so.1.3 and
'grep' ing for gethostbyname|connect|socket|inet_ntoa|send strings and the
genuine library is normally having no bussiness with these strings.
run in the terminal

strings /lib/libkeyutils.so.1.9 | grep
gethostbyname|connect|socket|inet_ntoa|send strings /lib/libkeyutils.so.1.3
| grep gethostbyname|connect|socket|inet_ntoa|send



"	Interprocess communication is reported as achieved through shared
memory, if the system is rooted, SSHD owned memory may be seen.
"	Some of the known and in wild samples are:
o	libkeyutils.exe
o	vti-rescan
o	471EE431030332DD636B8AF24A428556EE72DF37
o	471ee431030332dd636b8af24a428556ee72df37_libkeyutils.so.1.9
o	ecea5cc15532ffac4b8159bf860c63c1

"	  the fuzzy hashing can help detect the similarly matching files:
ssdeep:768:KkGyZKfTRlHCxuT965gvghuBec2X4yxE9rW7owJ:tZKtELEFW7o+
"	occurrence of many sleep processes (lsof may reveal), sleeps may be
running from SSH, and check the SSH_CONNECTION environment variable (not
tested)

Recommendations
"	Remove the malicious library and restart SSH server, run the below
given in shell prompt
o	# rm lib/libkeyutiils.so.1.9 /lib/libkeyutils.so.1
o	#ln -sf /lib/libkeyutiils-1.3.so /lib/libkeyutiils.so.1
o	#sync
o	#echo 'b' >/proc/sysrq-trigger / simulate a hard power cut to ensure the
rootkit cant reroot it its memory resident (not tested)
"	Change all credentials, SSH passwords, Web Host manager -WHM(cpanel),
and any other admin passwords on the server.
"	Prevent Access of SSH from outside- firewall it, allow only the
trusted.
"	Nessus released a plugin to detect the rootkit
o	http://www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=64913
"	Keep update the system as well as the 3rd party applications. (java,
flash in particular)
"	Changing the LOGLEVEL to verbose. It is learnt that the ssh connections
specific to these rootkits are not logged in the SSH log files
(/var/log/secure) or (/var/log/auth) . Hence recommended to enable the
verbose logging mechanisms (set loglevel to versbose /etc/ssh/sshd_config
and (in ubuntu box))
"	Consider installing snoopy logger which logs all the commands issued
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/snoopylogger/)
"	Monitor the traffic to random domains (.biz, .info and .net domains,
78.47.139.110 (hard coded and XOR ed )  over port 53/UDP, the
communication is mostly encrypted

"	Run Linux Anti-malware solution
"	Keep up-to-date the system as well as the 3rd party applications (java,
flash)

dear professor partha,
hope you recall our meeting and discussions during CDAC meet at Hyderabad.

Anna University CEG and Distance Education Programme (MCA) are having
subjects such as Network and Security. In fact, I have just come from the
syllabus committee meeting of M.Sc. (CS-FOSS) online course where we are
introducing this as one of the subjects during 3rd sem (of the 4-sem
programme).

Will try to rustle up contact info and pass it on to you. Let me know when
you plan to visit chennai -- the general time period -- so that i could get
you to meet some of the people in this arena. You can also check up
www.au-kbc.org, and get in touch with
Prof C N Krishnan cnkrish at au-kbc.org who is coordinating the online M.Sc.
programme and Prof Sethuraman who is the AU-KBC expert on network and
security.

with best wishes

All Charted Accountants, ICWA Grads are also certified professionals
only, who just got certified.

On the IT front, I have seen people who have finished their
certifications for the sake of it, and there are those which have real
value. One of the real value certifications is Oracle Certified Java
Enterprise Architect. A certification that becomes junk if not
properly done is - Oracle Java Application Developer Certification.
Both of them from the same stable. These are just examples. There
should be tonnes of others out there. There are others, which only
when you cross, would you under the concept at all. You don't have to
write the certification, but once you learn it - why not? Eg: TOGAF.

What you are referring to is called "cracking". Yes, the media has
misused the term for decades. Don't fall into the trap!

In all the recent Workshops / FDP which I do in colleges, I give preference
for training them on GCC and GNU Toolchains (gcc, g++, gdb, make, gcov,
autoconf, automake etc).

The interesting fact is, both the staffs and students are getting attracted
when demoing GNU tools

Instead of compiling a C program directly through GCC and creating
executable, I demo the various stages during the GCC compilation process
separately like C Source code -> Pre-processed code -> Assembly Code ->
Object File -> Linking -> Executable

Illustrating with an example of the above process.

program: hello.c

#include<stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
  printf("Hello GCC\n");
  return 0;
}

$cpp hello.c > hello.i (here hello.i is a pre-processed file)

$gcc -Wall -S hello.i (creates assembly file hello.s)

$as hello.s -o hello.o (creates object file)

$ld <linking the object file with 'C' run-time libraries> (or for
simplicity)

$gcc hello.o (creates a.out, the final executable)

When the above process is demonstrated, even the faculty members are
getting excited to know about the power of 'gcc' compiler.

Similar case with make / Makefile also.  Once they understand the
importance of make, they automatically create Makefile and simply do 'make'
to compile their 'C' programs.

I have seen good results on the above things and continue to do so in
future programs.

as usual, a sizeable number of lecturers themselves need to be

I am maintaining a separate list to keep connected with all HOD's / College

http://www.freelists.org/post/linuxpert/FREE-Printed-Books-on-Open-Source-Software-and-Development-Tools-for-All-Engineering-Colleges-in-Tamilnadu

So far 70+ engineering colleges have applied for these books and we are
already in the process of distributing the same to colleges.

And the students rarely listen to the teachers -- but talks from experts

Definitely yes.  That's why I have planned to do atleast 50+ workshops in
this year.

Believe me, today I went to 7 engineering colleges and all HOD's expressed
their interest to switch most labs to Linux.

Hello everybody,

Hot on the heels of the announcements of the Ubuntu SDK and the Touch
Developer Preview, we bring you the first ever Ubuntu SDK Days.

On Thursday, 14th March and Friday, 15th March a number of app
developers and Ubuntu SDK creators will get you started writing apps for
Ubuntu on multiple devices. It's surprisingly simple, and since the
announcement we've seen many early adopters try out the SDK and the
first apps up and running. We will answer your questions, talk about
best practises and show you the power of the SDK.

Here a quick overview over the sessions we'll run:

    Installing and Configuring the SDK
    Writing your first app with the SDK
    Writing games with QML and Javascript
    Live update from the development progress of the Touch Core Apps
    Several Q&A sessions
    Making the best of the Ubuntu App Design guidelines
    More about the SDK skunkworks projects
    Introducing Friends and Gwibber QML
    Writing a new generation of Scopes
    Lightning talks and Project demos

How to join

Participating is easy: just head to http://ubuntuonair.com to watch the
sessions on the schedule. Videos will be available after the event, to
ensure you can watch the content even if you couldn't make it to the
session you wanted.

Check out https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuSDKDays/ to see the timetable of
the event, be there for lots of fun and bring your friends - and your
questions too!

Have a great day,
 Daniel

Yes, I am using Brian Gough's 'An Introduction to GCC' as reference and
thanks for your good presentation.

Some suggestions:

* More detailed explanation is required when creating shared libraries
using GCC and linking as in
http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/shared-libraries-linux-gcc.html (slide
no.21 is little bit complex for beginners to understand as there is not
much explanation)

* The coverage testing program *cov.c* can be included in the presentation
itself with some explanation on how 'gcov' can be used to analyse the
number of times each line of a program is executed during run (this
actually creates interest among the participants, how to find the areas of
the code which are not used or not executed during a run)

* Regarding 'ldd', you can add one more point that 'ldd' can be used not
only on *executables*, but also on *shared libraries itself*

* Looking for a similar presentation separately for gdb, autoconf, automake
and using make/Makefile (with some detailed explanation on
target,dependencies,commands)

TIA

You mean, like "lint"ing?

This stackoverflow thread may be of help to you:

Cracking is misusing the hacks. These were paid by the companies who 
design the software that runs on server.

There are several mistakes developers make in the case of tight deadline 
implication. Our job is to spot them.

Nope. That is precisely why I gave the links for reference. Also, the
real hacker culture was prevalent from the days of PDP-10:

Truth is always bitter?

You can continue to reply for the sake of replying, without reading
the documentation, or giving any reference. But, I am afraid, it
doesn't add anything to your credibility.

Another experience of the actual hacker culture was given by Guy L.
Steele, Jr., in a Foreword he had written [1]:

"I also enjoyed, in that summer of 1972, reading a brand-new MIT
research memo called HAKMEM, a bizarre and eclectic potpourri of
technical trivia.

Why ?HAKMEM?? Short for ?hacks memo?; one 36-bit PDP-10 word could
hold six 6-bit characters, so a lot of the names PDP-10 hackers worked
with were limited to six characters. We were used to glancing at a
six-character abbreviated name and instantly decoding the
contractions. So naming the memo ?HAKMEM? made sense at the time?at
least to the hackers."

You can either read history and learn from it, or you can accept facts
and reality. The choice is yours. We have nothing to lose.

With due respect to the patience of the list members, I'll stop here. Period.

Thanks for the considered response Shakthi.
Mr. Karthikeyan: please do consider reading up the references. A historical
understanding is very useful for the seriousFOSS student.

Source: http://news.opensuse.org/2013/03/13/opensuse-12-3-free-open-and-awesome/

openSuSE 12.3 is released today.

The Highlights:

Finishing touches
openSUSE 12.3 finishes the integration of systemd and delivers a
better system log experience with journald. Reliable graphical package
management tools and a new theme bring a consistent experience from
boot to desktop. The 1GB live images are now optimized for USB sticks
and the ARM team has stable openSUSE 12.3 ARM v7 and experimental ARM
64bit images ready for this exciting architecture.


Polishing up
The latest desktops bring additional polish with much faster metadata
handling, a new print manager and improved bluetooth integration in
KDE?s Plasma Desktop and improved notifications, better file
management and account integration for Exchange and Windows Live in
GNOME Shell.


New Features
12.3 brings new technologies to users with the inclusion of PostgreSQL
9.2 which comes with native JSON support (noSQL style). We?ve moved
over from MySQL to MariaDB as default. This is the first openSUSE
release with a complete OpenStack ?Folsom? for cloud fans and this
release debuts the E17 desktop and the Sawfish and awesome window
managers.


Moving forward
openSUSE moves forward with the inclusion of updated applications.
DigiKam 3.0 comes with much expanded abilities for batch processing of
images and new and improved filters & plugins; the major PIM
applications received updates with Evolution now having an

Do you have the DNS server implemented in your network?

Give a proper hostname for the machine and you can call it using the
hostname itself.

If there is no DNS, add the following entry in /etc/hosts

10.243.96.73    <hostname>


in all the machines.

Then you can access the server, with the hostname.


In the subversion edge admin panel.
i.e
http://10.243.96.73:3343/csvn/server/edit

select "server settings" and in the hostname text box, give the
hostname of the server.

and save the changes.

You would need to do a 'svn switch --relocate' to change the
repository path for a working copy.

Hi,

Some of might have started a bit and left in the middle. You have a
chance to rejoin as we have more people and more fun than ever!

We have a nice status tracking page created by Anish and Jishnu
http://vps.aneesh.nl/diaspora.html (we have 56% completion now)

It is easier to find gems without much dependencies
http://people.debian.org/~boutil/diaspora/ thanks to Cedric
Boutillier, a debian developer from France (though you might still
find a few more dependencies for running tests).

We have great documentation created by Nandaja Varma (3rd year
computer science student from NSS Palakkad) and Markus Nadir Tornow
(from Germany) http://wiki.debian.org/Diaspora/Packaging Many common
issues like test failures are documented now.

We have ruby gurus (Srihari, Vamsee, Hemanth) to help with ruby
specific issues. They are helping us make gem2deb even better.

We have regular irc meetings every saturday at 8pm IST, so join in
(most of the time someone will be hanging out there so hop on any time
you are free).  #debian-diaspora on irc.oftc.net or via web
http://mibbit.com/?channel=%23debian-diaspora&server=irc.oftc.net

Its really great learning opportunity and you can see how her work
with debian diaspora team helped get an internship any time she
chooses! https://nandajavarma.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/minidebconf-at-nit-c/

All in all, its the right time to jump in and help us get to apt-get
install diaspora, have lots of fun doing it and learn with the best
people in technology.

Note: We can even have packaging session at a time convenient to you,
just talk to us on irc

Cheers
Praveen

Sub. Main JEE site is discriminatory, non standards compliant and
excludes non-IE Users

Dear Sir/Madam,

                   I am writing on behalf of the following Free
Software groups* based in India. We notice with great alacrity that
the main JEE website (http://jeemain.nic.in/jeemain2013/Welcome.aspx )
excludes all those who use standards compliant browsers like Firefox
and Google Chrome and makes the use of Microsoft Internet Explorer
mandatory.

The attached file documents the problem with handling admit cards on
the site with non IE browsers.

It is well known that this practice of favoring Microsoft
preferentially (despite its anti-freedom machinations, technical
incompetence, noncompliance with standards and dwindling user-base
(see [6]-[9] and related links)) has its roots in systemic corruption.
Also any browser-specific 'lock-in' is a direct violation of clause
7.6 (b) of 'Guidelines for Indian Government Websites'
(http://darpg.nic.in/darpgwebsite_cms/Document/file/Guidelines_for_Government_websites.pdf
).

"It is a MUST that Indian Government websites are tested for multiple
browsers and versions of browser, operating systems, connection
speeds, and screen resolution to ensure access by all"

We (and all other honest freedom-loving people) will be pleased if you
do take appropriate remedial action in this regard.


Thank and Regards

This list is not the right place to ask questions about Windows XP
imho. That said, did you try using Virtualbox
(https://www.virtualbox.org)?

Nice. Just change the word 'alacrity' to maybe 'alarm'? Alacrity means
'cheerful willingness'.

Sub. Main JEE site is discriminatory, non standards compliant and
excludes non-IE Users

Dear Sir/Madam,

                   I am writing on behalf of the following Free
Software groups* based in India.

We notice with dismay that the main JEE website
(http://jeemain.nic.in/jeemain2013/Welcome.aspx ) excludes all those
who use standards compliant browsers like Firefox and Google Chrome
and makes the use of Microsoft Internet Explorer mandatory.

The attached file documents the problem with handling admit cards on
the site with non IE browsers.

This practice of favoring Microsoft preferentially (despite its
anti-freedom machinations, technical incompetence, noncompliance with
standards and dwindling user-base (see [6]-[8] and related links))
suggests many things. Also any browser-specific 'lock-in' is a direct
violation of clause 7.6 (b) of 'Guidelines for Indian Government
Websites' (http://darpg.nic.in/darpgwebsite_cms/Document/file/Guidelines_for_Government_websites.pdf
).

"It is a MUST that Indian Government websites are tested for multiple
browsers and versions of browser, operating systems, connection
speeds, and screen resolution to ensure access by all"

We (and all other honest people) will be pleased if you will take
appropriate remedial action in this regard.

Thank and Regards

Nice work by you Sir!

Most of the govt websites designed by NIC are like the JEE websites. 
Another example is here. http://ssconline.nic.in/
It asks to use either IE or Opera, both being proprietary.

Funny, it says netscape not supported . I was using chromium browser
which is webkit based . Does it do the same for every browser ?

On a serious note, yes many such websites exist and Delhi LUG has
(oops had) this "hall of shame " page on its wiki where it lists such
website .
Delhi LUG wiki http://www.lug-delhi.org/wiki/HallOfShame/ is no more ,
but its archived at
http://web.archive.org/web/20070220071634/http://www.lug-delhi.org/wiki/HallOfShame/Websites
Do read the policy and selection criterion for the websites,vendors
and ISP's to be listed
http://web.archive.org/web/20070224002958/http://lug-delhi.org/wiki/HallOfShame/

^^ Its really sad that such huge efforts by community are gone to
archives . Its high time we move those contents to other wiki ?

Hi,

Can anyone know / confirm that raspberrypi has TrustZone support? There are
some forum threads in raspberrypi.org website saying it is supported while
some other say it is not supported. It will be great if someone could
clarify this.

Thanks and Regards,

This will only be seen in the Broadcom processor specification sheet
which is available to developers and partner of Broadcom on a NDA.
This is the reason why R-Pi cannot publish the spec sheet on their
site.

Does anyone here have access to the specification sheet? Their brief
spec on the website does not carry more than 5 lines of info.

You would get to see TrustZone on microcontrollers as a need more than
on SoCs. BCM 2835 is a SoC for multimedia applications and thus has
little reason to have a TrustZone implementation.

This is not kosher in LUG but I will answer anyway.

Find out the competitive prices and price it somewhat low.

I have never regretted pricing low for my customers as that always
 gave me satisfaction.

Money can be made later also.

What is required is that we should learn enough to do more work.

So in order to keep getting work we have to price low.

For a small we app anything less than 10k INR is okay.

Charging by the hour or by one time quote?
Easy way - see how long it will take you.
Say 8 hours
Next see how many hours you want to work a week - say 40
So now you have 5 days of 8 hours each.
How much do you want to make a month?
Divide that amount by 5*4 = 20 working days
Now you have a daily rate and can extrapolate an hourly rate.
Add a percentage for expenses such as Internet, electricity.
Use this hourly rate and how much time the project will take to guide you
on the rate to quote the customer.
Use some of Girish's suggestions as well ;-)
BTW, non Linux topics - please add (OT) to subject. It means off-topic.

Dear all,

KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology, Arasur, Coimbatore Dt. (
www.kpriet.ac.in) organized a two days National Level Workshop on Open
Source Software on 15/03/2013 and 16/03/2013.

Myself conducted a session on 'GNU/Linux and FOSS in Engineering Education'
on 15/03/2013.

Around 70+ participants from 20 engineering colleges attended the workshop.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank KPR College Management and the following persons
for organizing the workshop.

Dr. K.P.Arulshri - Principal,
Prof. Pon. Harshavardhanan - HOD / CSE
Mr. T. Rajasekaran - AP / CSE


March 16, 2013:
---------------

A 32 seat FOSS Lab was setup in CSI College of Engineering, Ketti Valley,
Near Ooty (www.csice.org) using Fedora 18/14 for the Dept. of CSE.

Contact person: Mr. Prasath / Lecturer - CSE

This FOSS Lab implementation is dedicated to our beloved KG (as he asked me
last year whether I had done for this college and it was done now).  A
three days FOSS workshop has been planned to be conducted from March 25th -
27th, 2013.

Subject: [Ilugc] rss , xml and free education
Message-ID: <CALDskyyJETkrHKGGqywRPBbB53ytYigscP-DCptr2nX0Av7yDQ@mail.gmail.com>

I had a very interesting conversation with my customer.

He says that education in the biggest colleges worldwide are becoming free.

This must be because of Khan academy and wikipedia.

And generally because of the culture of the Internet.

And this happens with the power of XML.

Let me explain.

RSS is the magic in a lot of places.

Just like HTML and JS can be displayed in many ways using CSS, the same
 RSS Feed can be interpreted in many ways.

Resulting in lot of ways in which we can view and access media info
like podcasts,
 video and plain text.

RSS which stands for I dunno what maybe rich site summary or
syndication is nothing
 but plain XML(plain text) that publishes content.

And RSS is a pull model in which you express interest like a facebook
like and the
 channel will give you updates.

In many portable devices like phones and tablets the media is
downloaded for offline listening/viewing/reading.

I also did not know that books are now available in mp3 formats in
which someone reads out the text.

The original RSS specification was apparently created by Netscape but
it has taken more than a decade for it
 to become popular and accepted.

Anyway I will discuss how to create and parse XML with XML::RSS Perl
CPAN module one of these days.

I am doing a project involving podcasts and publishing XML.

Many of the websites apparently use html but they actually use xml.

Even Amazon S3 uses it.

It is  a silent power like India's role in world religions.

Hi ILUGC!

     We (Kumaran and Dr. Easwar) are excited to announce that we have
achieved a stable base in AuShadha development. The current development
stage of AuShadha has largely been the effort of Dr. Easwar himself.

AuShadha is an Open Source Electronic Medical Records (EMR) & Public Health
Management System for Small Clinics. It might be even suited for speciality
medical practice after some customisation. It is being developed with
Python, Django and Dojo.

There are many, great Open Source EMRs that are available, but most of them
lack a good front-end. The purpose of AuShadha is to provide a
state-of-the-art, visually appealing, easy-to-use intuitive front-end
interface that is suited for traditional desktop interfaces. This is the
first step in creating a polished open-source EMR. Look out for more UI
improvements to come in the future.

We strongly believe that any open-source project is only as good as its
community. To help improve AuShadha beyond the current state, we thought it
would be fun to invite anyone who is interested to develop and contribute
to it along with us. We would also like AuShadha to benefit from
user-inputs and feature requests.

Check out the current state of AuShadha demo
here.<http://dreaswar.com/2013/01/02/hosted-live-demo-for-aushadha-open-source-electronic-medical-records-project/>

To start developing and contributing to AuShadha, please join our
mailing-list here<https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/aushadha>
.

Charge $15 to $25 per man hour depdendig on your / your workers 
capacity. We charge $25 and we are overbooked anyway. So that would be a 
reasonable price.

Who told you to use that command? Never heard

chmod u+rwx  <file>

and before that you have to

chown <username> <file>

or directory.

about Lua scripting on wikis
To: Wikimedia India Community list <wikimediaindia-l at lists.wikimedia.org>


Hi, Wikimedia India community!

We enabled Lua on all Wikimedia sites last week. Lua
<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Lua> is a scripting language that
enables wiki editors to write faster and more powerful MediaWiki
templates, and is reasonably easy to learn.  We're pretty excited about
this, partly because of the promise of Lua + Wikidata
<https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/03/14/what-lua-scripting-means-wikimedia-open-source/>.
 You might have heard about this on the Wikimedia tech blog
<https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/03/11/lua-templates-faster-more-flexible-pages/>
or the tech ambassadors list
<http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-ambassadors/2013-March/000171.html>.

If you have questions about how to convert existing templates to Lua (or
how to create new ones), we'll be holding two support sessions on IRC
this week.  You're probably more interested in the one on Wednesday 20
March
<http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=02&min=00&sec=0&day=20&month=03&year=2013>
(for Oceania, Asia & America). There's also one on Friday
<http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=18&min=00&sec=0&day=22&month=03&year=2013>
(for Europe, Africa & America).

See m:IRC office hours
<https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC_office_hours> for details. If you
can't make it, you can also get help at mw:Talk:Lua scripting
<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Talk:Lua_scripting>.

If you'd like to learn about this kind of event earlier in advance,
consider becoming a Tech ambassador
<https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Tech/Ambassadors> by subscribing to the
mailing list
<https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-ambassadors>.

Thanks,

It's time for another hackfest! This time around, we're able to expand
the hacking to automated (autopkg and autopilot) and manual tests.
There's something for everyone to help and contribute. You don't need to
know code, or be a programmer to help write tests. All you need is your
testing mindset and your keyboard. Of course, if you are a developer
there's some great opportunities to contribute autopkg and autopilot
tests as well, with folks around ready to help.

So what is this hackfest? "A hackfest is a gathering of interested
contributors with the goal of contributing new testcases as well as
fixing and enhancing existing testcases." In other words, it's a virtual
party on IRC to help write new tests!

The hackfest will occur Tuesday, March 19th, from 1200 UTC to 2300 UTC.
To participate, see the pages below and show up on #ubuntu-quality on
IRC. We picked a 12 hour window to help accommodate the different
timezones and schedules -- pick a good time for you!

Please take a look at the following pages for more information (a
special thanks to Javier and others for helping set these up, great job!):

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Hackfest
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Hackfest/20130319

Thanks everyone, and I hope to see you there!

Fedora-18 has about 30K packages overall.  Our kickstart based remote
installation installs about 7.5K packages (almost all package groups in
F18, excluding languages).

After the lab setup, the college system admin told me that he would
immediately discuss with HOD, Principal and Management to change most labs
to Linux/FOSS.  This experience I had in almost all the colleges I visited
/ setup labs.

Repeating again that, the colleges have completely lost interest in
Proprietary OS / Applications and all institutions wants to switch  to
Linux.  By 2015, about 70% of engineering colleges in TN would be using
Linux in their IT infrastructure.  Changes in curriculum and avoiding
proprietary applications in lab requirements could make this process a lot
easier and earlier.

Subject: [Ilugc] converting wsdl based soap to REST api
Message-ID: <CAND2794WcAxYO8xvY-VBbrP8s8QOHQuDXpixNrYA3nt=dhR8LQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a web application running remotely which provides soap service via wsdl.

I am using python code to interact with the application via SOAPPy libraries.
It is tough for me to create required objects in that application
specific format.

Is it possible to convert the wsdl objects to REST based json objects
and use in the python code
without changing anything on the server.

The application is not providing REST api so far.

Thanks.

Subject: [Ilugc] A serious issue of Amazon Elastic Load Balancer
Message-ID: <1363763060.7033.YahooMailNeo@web125905.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi all,
?for last few days I am facing problem while configuring ELB at Amazon cloud (EC2). The issue is, I am not getting client IP address while I have configured the ELB listener in Layer 4(TCP) mode in server variable, while I am getting that in Layer 7(HTTP) mode. I need client IP for my application.

?Still ELB has the issue of?SSL/TLS Renegotiation?vulnerability. So, I am not able to use ELB listener in Layer7(HTTP) mode, rather I am using ELB listener in Layer4(TCP) mode and handle the?SSL/TLS Renegotiation?vulnerability through Apache web server.

That means......
Mode of Listener ? ?| ?Client IP address ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?| ? ? ??SSL/TLS Renegotiation?vulnerability? ? ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Layer4(TCP) ? ? ? ? ? | ? Not Available ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? | ? ? ? ? ?Vulnerability can be overcome
Layer7(HTTP) ? ? ? ? | ? ? Available ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? | ? ? ? ? ?Vulnerability can not be overcome



I need both the feature(Client IP and Vulnerability overcome).


I have written to Amazon support, but till now got very poor support from them. Now I am posting this issue to these list, so that if anyone have any idea to resolve that can share with everyone.


Below is the mail that I have written to Amazon support......
---------------------------------------------------
Hi,
?as per the document published at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-listener-config.html ....

"When you use TCP for both front-end and back-end connections, your load balancer will forward the request to the back-end instances without modification to the headers."

But unfortunately I am not getting IP address of client from the server variable "REMOTE_ADDR" on Layer 4 configuration of ELB. I am getting modified address on that variable. How can I get the actual one?

I have no option to create Layer 7 configuration of ELB because still ELB has issue with SSL/TLS Renegotiation. Currently I am handling this issue from ?Apache server of back-end instance.

Now I need to know the process to know the IP address of client through Layer 4 configuration of ELB. Without client IP our application will not run properly. I am not able to run the application.?

Waiting for prompt reply?
.. thanks.

You have to solve the problem by using cookies and custom HTTP headers
to include
 the original client IP address before rewriting.

The custom HTTP header can added from client side only (as of my knowledge). But how can I get public IP address if the client is running behind proxy?


Can you please explain me the term rewriting? For that what I have to do? I have to write any code?

You can use openbsd relayd(8) for that.

No code. Just configuration.

Message-ID: <CACqthKHb80_pZtxmRYdoWUTpO3FHZ=SiFaMuPyhSBaRn=FE-FA@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,
you might be aware (thru earlier mails sent by Ramadoss) that Anna
University is offering M.Sc. (CS-FOSS) 4-semester programme thru distance
education mode.
The lectures are delivered in online mode on saturdays/sundays and the
programme is coordinated through AU-KBC Research Centre, MIT Campus,
Chromepet, Anna University Chennai.

You can get details about the course curriculum at the "M.Sc. (CS-FOSS)"
links the following url : http://au-kbc.org/

Primary Target group : working/non-working persons who have completed B.Sc.
Maths/Physics/Comp Science. (though B.E. students have also joined the
programme).

Course duration : at least 4 semesters, but the students (especially the
working persons) are advised to not to take the full load of 5 subjects per
semester, but spread it over 6 plus semesters.

So far about 100 plus students have registered and attended two batches of
this programme. The third batch is about to begin by end April 2013 and the
registration is likely to close by 2nd week of April.

I would appreciate if you could spread the word about the programme so that
students across the country could check it out. For further details,
contact me <srini.it at gmail.com> or Prof C N Krishnan <cnkrish at au-kbc.org>
or Mr. Senthil Anand (senthils at au-kbc.org> at AU-KBC

I am sure FOSS community members will have many
queries/comments/suggestions regarding this programme and alternative modes
of drawing students into FOSS. We could discuss in the group mail or you
could catch me at my personal gmail id.

A half-day seminar is being organized at AU-KBC on 27th March (10.00 A.M to
1:00 P.M.). Those interested, especially in and around Chennai could attend
the same -- preferably pre-register by contacting AU-KBC.
[Since the Arts & Science Colleges in TN are closed, you could help out by
forwarding this mail to your acquaintances -- students/staff/alumni-mail
groups or give me the contact info so that I could reach out to them.]

thanks and best wishes

would be grateful if  you could forward this msg to other LUG groups.

Girish,
?That means you are suggesting me to replace ELB with an amazon EC2 instance running relayd as a load-balancer. Am I a correct?

It is not perfect solution. Because Amazon ELB has redundancy support, that means if an ELB somehow goes down another ELB will come alive to support the load-balancing service. If I run a single EC2 instance then how can I overcome from this situation?

So, I need a solution without replacing ELB.

You can use openbsd relayd(8) for that.

No code. Just configuration.

These are not questions that can be answered offhand.

I gave you ideas. Look at ha-proxy.

Even if it is a cloud old ideas do apply.

However there are guys with enough cloud background in LUG and elsewhere who
 also can perhaps help you.

I suggest you hire a consultant and spend some cash if you are not in
a position
 to benefit by list feedback.

Best of luck.

Message-ID: <CAFHFDAkwSH+m1ZLdMqy92iq0RMcr0O7AOcJ160TSDG=4CKzTOg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am tasked with finding a solution for monitoring 500 Dell server and the
DRAC card on them.  One thing I found it that these DRAC cards are capable
of just sending out snmptrap should something go wrong,  since I do not
have experience setting up something like this previously so I
investigating about what I could use and started with

1. opsview and later quit that idea because I don't want that agent on the
server apart from snmpd running on it.
2. mrgt - I did not like the interface
3. cacti - Trying to see if it could accept snmptraps
4. opennms

If you feel you have a very good tool that I should look into do let me
know about the same.

Umm, I'm sorry, but I don't know much about the second part -- could you 
describe what you exactly you mean by SSL/TLS Renegotiation vulnerability.

As far as getting the client IP is concerned the 'accepted standard' way of 
doing this behind an ELB (when using http)  is by looking at the X-Forwarded-For 
header. There are a few quirks you should be aware of but there is enough info 
available online to help you out.

PS: @SK : I think this is a valid question and not OT. What if he had just 
phrased it differently as "I have a debian EC2 instance running behind an ELB 
server, which responds to http requests. I need my apache server running on this 
debian instance to get the client IP ..."  ? It is a tech question to do with a 
linux stack -- it's valid IMHO

The problem is multi-fold:

1. We do not know what the ELB server does or doesn't do. So, any
assumptions or decisions made, will affect the prior testing done. It
is still a black-box in the setup, and the vendor is the right person
to ask for help. That is why it is called "vendor lock-in".

2. Whatever advice given, whether implemented correctly or not,
without informing the vendor, will affect the terms and conditions
agreed by the customer. The Service Level Agreements will have these
clauses.

3. Also, the customer is paying for a service from the vendor. They
have every right to ask them for support, and escalate the issue if
required.

I am glad that people come forward to help. But, at the same time, we
need to ensure that they understand the implications of their actions.

Hope this clarifies my reply.

Regards,

SK

you can try icinga, which is a fork of nagios with more features and good

Pl visit  115.249.106.147/mscfoss/  and the menu items on curricula and
syllabus for course details. Other menus give background etc.
The programme targets working/non-working science and comp science
graduates - B.Sc, B.C.A though B.E. graduates have also taken it up.
Essentially a computer science course --language, database, networking, dev
practices, etc. -- with focus on only FOSS  tools and packages.

Hi,

      I have 11 years experience in system administration. Currently I am
working as Assistant Manager - IT to handle windows and Linux environments.
My educational qualification is Diploma in Computer Technology(Three
years). I have RHCE certification. I have been looking for change. But I
dont get any chance. It makes me think about pursuing degree. I read so
many articles and books. But still unable to come for conclusion about the
importance of degree. If I decide to pursue, I have to go for distance
learning only. Then I need to decide for course(like BCA,BBA) and
university. I dont have support from my current company to attend classes
and exams. Hope this list is having lot of experienced system admins and IT
managers who crossed this kind of situation.

    Kindly share your experience to overcome this.

    Thanks for your help.

I got a laptop which is some 6-7 years old.

Processor is Intel Pentium M Processor 1600 MHz

The laptop has 2G RAM and 40G hard disk.

When I tried to install ubuntu 12.04, It can not boot with the OS itself.

Showed the following error.

It comes with all the media codecs and all

If you need still more light-weight (comes with Openbox), debian based distro, consumes less memory from ram (~30 Mb of Ram memory when everything is up), looks beautiful, got a active community behind it try Crunchbang Linux (http://crunchbang.org). Though it does not comes with some pre-installed tools, automatic short-cuts are provided with the Openbox menu to install LibreOffice and other basic tools.

I just loved the script that runs only once initially after installation on reboot (which actually gets you set-up your development environment). If someone is curious, go ahead, give it a try.?

I am running crunchbang on my 5 year old desktop which has just 356 Mb or Ram with 40 Gb HDD, Intel Pentium IV. So far too good.

Hi everyone,

KDE will ?- for the first time this year - participate in the
"Outreach Program for Women"[1]. This was originally started by GNOME,
but has also other participating organisations like Wikimedia,
Mozilla, Fedora and others.

With KDAB as our sponsor we will be offering one internship. This is
in no way only limited to coding, but includes user experience design,
graphic design, documentation, web development, marketing, translation
and other types of tasks needed to sustain a Free Software project.

Prerequisits for application: Any woman who has not previously
participated in an Outreach Program for Women or Google Summer of Code
internship is welcome to apply, provided she is available for a
full-time internship during this time period. This program is open to
anyone who identifies as a woman regardless of gender presentation or
assigned sex at birth. Genderqueer and genderfluid people are welcome
to apply.

The application deadline for candidates is already on May 1st, while
the program runs from June 17 to September 23.

Please all, suggest suitable tasks on this wiki page [2] and volunteer
to mentor. Feel free to contact me or Lydia for more information.

 After 11 yrs of experience, doing some course just for the sake of getting
a degree is a waste of time. It will not add an iota of value in the eyes
of a prospective employer. It might even have a negative effect.  Time
would be better spent learning programming.

The reply is misplaced. It is necessary to get a degree.

I have around 30 years  of experience in the Indian IT minefield (Industry).

the "Manokaran" is spouting a stupid idea.

Rather than calling them evil, call them non compliant web sites (per
open standards) and cite the specific reason for each.  For instance
site requires a specific browser or a proprietary plug in to function.

Okay now.

It is a long time since I sent a non technical mail for technical people.

Right now my life is revolving around hacking just as it did since 2003.

Hacking is the art of programming in such a way that you enjoy it so much that
 you lose your interest in everything else.

In order to attain that joy and gratification one has to patiently
learn programming for many many years.

Just coding and doing some work for the sake of doing some college
project or fulfilling some professional
 need cannot be qualified as hacking.

That is just contract labor.

Hacking happens when you solve a problem for your own personal need;
to improve your productivity,
 to upload your photographs to facebook after writing a script with
ImageMagick convert(1) or using
 mplayer or mpg3info to process your audios or some such thing.

Hacking enhances the richness and quality of life, the same way Hindu
religion gives us so many
 different richness all around us thereby defining an entire nation
and even many nations.

Hacking is the art of coding using scientific principles and
mathematical accuracy with the artistic
 elegance of a painter.

Alright now I really have to get back to work.

Hacking that is.

Have fun.

As computers are just huge state machines I think it is better to
teach your kid mathematics. Teaching mathematics conceptually let your
kid think or rather visualise mathematically will make her take up any
challenge (be it to related to science, economics / finance, biology,
computing or any field found or yet to be found) and shine in that.

Even better would be teach helping tendency, humanity, showing
kindness towards all creatures, righteousness and other values. These
ideals will make your kid shine more than learning mathematics.

PS: I like mathematics and this may look biased but still learning
mathematics makes a huge difference.

PrasannaKumar.

But will it give a 4th std kid the same the joy as owning a tablet

OK
'Non-compliant with basic standards' looks like a usable umbrella term.

Mohan,

Without going into details I can tell you this much.

There are a few ways to do channel bonding.

But the best way seems to be aggregating multiple VPN endpoints like a
 German company pioneered many years ago(10 years).

TCP is a higher layer protocol. This project may have applications but
TCP is already
 a very complicated higher level layer. Adding this on top does not
make much sense
 according to me.

Instead the IP and data link layers are best to do this.

Without playing with routing we cannot achieve good bonding.

I have done a rudimentary aggregation with Tenet's CORDECT wireless
devices long
 ago when I was working in Banyan in Teynampet.

That was Nucleus OS. And all I did in the outgoing router choosing code is just
 do a round robin with the two wireless links.

Then I also remember testing it in another Tenet company in Adyar,
forget the name now.

But I think such half baked incomplete solutions are not good.

In the UNIX world, you can achieve this with BGP AS policy. You can do
this with
 ML PPP.

You can do this with ECMP which is what I normally use.ECMP is equal
cost multipath routing.

Then for simple link priority and failover I can use the trunk(4) idea
in OpenBSD(not VLAN trunk).

I feel that VPN approach is best.

I am yet to test this idea.

+1 to that , actually tablet or other "smart" mobiles hinder the
process of learning .

Yes. Yesterday, I had 3 of my ~5 year old cousins over in my place, and all
of them were so glued to their Apple MP3 players, Galaxy S2s and Android
tablets that they actually failed to interact with each other except for
exchanging game app titles and downloading them via the app markets. And
even though my cousins and almost all of my friends have smart phones they
aren't any closer to learning Linux than they would have been without the
smart phones.

A Tablet can be a good addition. But please consider better alternatives
like GCompris. A pet kitten or puppy can be a really good companion. And
math can be fun too. :-)

Message-ID: <CA+kPnB=aPBCdZHXck5Atvv5ZZfchVTmGO5jzu+QoYKxT-bD=og@mail.gmail.com>

I have been struggling with Omnet++ install for past few days on Mac, it
has to be compiled from source. whenever I run configure file, the say
tcl/tk is not found, though it is installed (compiled from source, version
8.6). I tried specifying directories in configure.user, as they said,
pointed to directory with " "tcl.sh" and "tk.sh" , still the error
persists. Omnet's install guide is not of much help regarding this.
Still I could successfully install it without TCL/TK, but can't see any
visual outputs on running simulations. Any solutions?
Only once Omnet is installed properly, we can start adding other
components, (again, all have to be compiled from source) which's another
mammoth task!

Is it easier to install on Linux by any chance? I'm little not comfortable
with Mac, but Linux package downloads are blocked by proxy of our
university, and to install dependencies for Omnet, we'll have to manually
download each package from repo, thats why I thought of sticking to Mac
itself!

I would say, its a good idea to start with raspberry pi. Both of you
can learn togather, instead of giving her a tablet. If you give her a
tablet, the only thing she will learn is how to play games and to get
more games. Desktops will do better what a tablet does, whether
teaching or playing games. Start with raspberry pi, and both of u work
togather to set it up and get it running. Pretend u don't know simple
things like how to connect the display cable to the board and let her
'help' you overcome your trouble. You can take it further in similar
ways. Anyway, the tablet seems like a poor way to start.

While creating the database in mysql/postgresql change it support Unicode
UTF-8 standards.

I don't have personal experience with that. just google for the procedure
to do.

Teaching her to follow good qualities and humanity to other creatures in
life will
be more useful. These will lead her to view the world in a different angle.

Tablets won't teach anything other than games at this age.

Teach her to enjoy learning mathematics.

Message-ID: <CAND2796Ocz1hDpv=gOuX=ts4hCBuHrF6qR3C0vZbD_3ANYyJTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

We are planning for developing a free tamil corpus.
To build such one, we have to develop  a web based portal for this.

Find the requirements here.
https://goinggnu.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/requirements-for-creating-a-free-corpus-for-tamil-language/

I am checking the options to host the code.

github seems famous and flashy.

But to develop a project, we need a place to host the documents, wiki,
issue tracker, mailing lists etc.
github lacks all these.


My search results are.

Sourceforge.net provides all but looks little older.
launchpad.net is fine but it is bzr friendly.

code.google.com is fine, but we need a googlegroups for discussions.

How you are running your open source projects  for collaborative development?

Please share your suggestions.

VPN is a very specific scenario. Cannot be used to access servers that
belong to others not giving VPN.

SCTP is an alternative transport protocol and has a lot of advantages
over TCP. Suffers from lack of support from boxes in the middle. TCP
though a bit flawed has a very wide adoption.

The key is the application is impervious  of TCP or MPTCP. It thinks
it is calling TCP as the call interface is the same. I wonder if the
TCP subflows are just like TCP such that session information will get
created at the CPE that is allowing the outgoing connection to allow
reply data through. This was my doubt.

Hi

Have you people experienced a situation where in Debian Ethernet link speed
settles for 100 Mb/s even when it is connected to a gigabit port on a
switch.  I have checked the switch configuration and found that to be on
auto status for link speed.  I used the ethtool on debian and it says that
I am connected to 100 Mb/s link.

Hi Shrinivasan,

(Am not sure how relevant this info with the topic)

Pls have a look in to

http://sourceforge.net/projects/tts-indianlang/files/

which is under GPL developed by a consortium under TDIL (Technology

This is completely OT , not 100% related to Linux, but related to
Programming


Back to my request  "I need a low cost or used Tablet for my Daughter [9
years old ] to learn" computer programming
I wanted her to learn how to manage machines by simple scripts.
When She was playing "Cut the Rope" in my iPhone, she asked me "Who Made it
?"
I gave answers, But she asked me , "Why you did not make it ?". I was
blaming others as my answer
Then she asked me, "When I will make a game ?". Then I told her about the
process., 
I helped her to try Scratch, seems she can manage. 
My choice for her is C and python programming.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Also, just few words about me

I am a School Teacher , with 16 years of experience in the same school
My Wife is also a School Teacher with 6 years of experience
I persuaded Master Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science [ Studied with
enthusiasm, not for just marks ]
Also B.Ed , which has child psychology [ again, with enthusiasm, not for
just marks ]
My Wife also persuaded Master Degree in Mathematics and Hindi , Also B.Ed.
I live with my Parents.
Because of my mother, my daughter does the "Kolam" once in a week, Started
learning simple "stitching". Also as a kid, playing with clay and toys
I also observe, where ever there is a group of kids, my daughter drops the
iPhone and other alien devices, Jumping into the play field with the kids. 
I am a Middle Class man, My Kid is growing like this.

--------------------
Once again, kindly help me to fine a low cost Tablet

Hey all,

We'll be hosting MozCafe Chennai - meetup of Mozillians and FOSS community members in and around Chennai region - this Thursday (28th March). For a change, we've planned to have it at Marina Beach at around 5 o'clock in the evening, to make it less formal.

All are welcome to join the event. If you're interested to participate, please check the agenda and add something if you feel like. Also, put your name down at the attendee list[1]

If you have questions of any kind and of any number, I always have my mobile phone turned on. Reach me at +91-9003297595.

Dwarak.

Having these info before would have helped. Get a raspberrypi and make
her to use scratch. No need of C or python (at least as of now). Let
her concentrate on game play (if it is a game) than letting her learn
C or python. Once she is good in logical thinking, problem solving and
other skills let her learn how things go inside when she does
something (let her learn C).

Everything can be done with C but no one is doing so now for practical
reasons. Let her know how to use the blocks available to create a
building and once she learns it to some level let her learn how those
building blocks are made.

Hope this helps,
PrasannaKumar

Hi,

    authorize.net is a good one. However the usual choice is PayPal.

    Hope you are aware of the RBI restrictions about payment gateways.
He are a couple that come to mind - Am told by PG sales guys that
Indian PGs should not transact foreign currencies (though I have seen
ccavenue accept euro payments). PayPal will not take INR payments
within india, but will take it for US destinations and vice-versa.

    So, essentially we are stuck with two mutually exclusive sets of
PGs one set that cater to India to India market, and the other for
foreign to foreign markets.

     There are also players like moneybookers (now skrill) - but not
sure how they operate multi currency and destinations.

Regards,
M

You could use

Paypal as default
Authorize.net
2Checkout
Sagepay
Google payment
Based on your client country it differ. It is all based on terms and
conditions and commission per transactions.

Nice,

I wish if somebody from IIT madras, could take a initiative to bring FabLab
to Chennai.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab

http://fab.cba.mit.edu/about/labs/

http://nirzaree.wordpress.com/2012/03/23/fab-labs-india/ .

I was at a Fablab in Germany, I see kids from 4 year old, playing around
and doing some creative and scientific things.
On the other side grown-ups are trying to get their innovative idea to
reality.

Dear All,

We value and always love to have your thoughts on our story. We did get
an interesting set of comments from you all on our last story idea ' How
important are FOSS certifications when it comes to the job  market?' We
have incorporated your views/ opinions in the story and we will soon
share the article with you. (This is scheduled for our forthcoming print
edition).
Well, we bring you another idea and we would appreciate if you share
your thoughts on the same. The latest news that is generating a lot of
buzz in the open source circuits is that Linux and Mozilla smartphones
may hit the markets this year! So this prompts us to come up with a
volley of questions...'If phones based on Linux and Mozilla OS make
their way in the market, which open source OS you would prefer to switch
on to..and why.?' (Linux, Mozilla, Ubuntu or will you stay with
Android?)..Do you see this a long term threat to Android? What's your
take on the same?

Please let us know!

Regards,

Priyanka

If many people are interested in getting such kit, I can ask one of my
friend who is dealing with the same controller to make this as well.

Message-ID: <CAPV1RAC7A1exb6Yw4gbbY8nXRy9fAt-ewC+0=O+2d2CJGsneLg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I have a Intel 82567LM (rev 03) Gigabit network card onboard on my laptop.
I am using ubuntu 12.10 OS and the default driver e1000e does not work. I
do not see ethX with ifconfig -a

ethtool -e eth0 emits this error message:
Cannot get driver information: No such device

So I have tried to download the latest drivers from
http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&ProdId=3003&DwnldID=15817&ProductFamily=Ethernet+Components&ProductLine=Ethernet+Controllers&ProductProduct=Intel%C2%AE+82567+Gigabit+Ethernet+Controller&lang=eng

and tried modprobed the new drivers of e1000e and e1000. Still I could not
see ethX network devices.

lspci shows the following entry :
00:19.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82567LM Gigabit Network

uname -a shows:

How do I solve this problem ?

Firstly I am not representing FabLab.

You can't generalise somthing like "4 Year Old", every kid has its own
unique quality.
If it is encouraged or in other words if he/she is  let to do what they
are  interested they can do wonders.

>From what i see FabLab is a open platform with machines and devices and
resources which cannot be afforded by common parents.
If you want to know more about it , Just google yourself.

I believe that the default linux drivers for intel GE cards are called
ixgbe. Just check for the latest one and try with them.

Try setting the switch to 1000mbps and the nic interface to auto. See if it
negotiates correctly? Or set both to gig and see if they work fine?

I had a chance to attend an OLPC meeting early this year and must say that
it was a pretty nice 'kit'.  I had an OLPC with me till early this month
and had to pass it on to a village where it is going to be used.  I wish i
had brought it to one of the ilugc meets!

Having said that, i must concur with the idea that kids should resort to
tablets/pc/mobiles only on an experimental basis to know that 'they exist'
and venture out in the wild to know the 'nature'. Avoiding the web/pc is
not a possibility in this digital age, but the primordial instincts should
make us see the sunlight too.

Hello Anyone know about SAP and is any books are available for SAP.

otherwise we need to study only thro SAP Institutes.

The Price for the course is really high They are asking around 3Lakhs for

Your driver is absolutely right. But sometimes new revision boards doesn't
support the existing driver.

Post the results of

lshw -C network

dmesg | grep e1000e

ifconfig -a

Let see which one is culpirit ?

You can check cables. Make sure cable has all eight wires. If it has
only 4 wires speed, it will work only at 100Mbps.

Subject: [Ilugc] Why is domain important?
Message-ID: <CALDskyyPRK43LGhGx6mh9QEQAWvRymmzo=ygUrySP7vbnaGZEw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear fellow hackers,

A lot of people when asked what domain they work on they say
insurance, finance and so on.

Or name the client,eBay, Ford.

That is not the way techies speak.

Domain is networking, database, server management, network monitoring etc.

Coding is done in programming languages which itself takes a lot of
time to master.

Alongside one also should focus on gaining domain know how.

A basic knowledge of networking and crypto,security is essential.

That is even true for non engineers.

I have met a lot of successful MCA "engineers" in my career.

Actually MCA is not engineering. And some do well due to hard work.

To do successful coding one has to think like an engineer.

Which means that you should know not just coding in which you obviously learn
 something like C or C++ or Java, perl or python.

In addition you also should master a technology area that is of your
interest and that demands
 your knowledge for the job.

Only in so doing you can achieve proficiency and truly enjoy hacking.

So to summarize in order to do well you have to know not just coding
but also a domain.

The concepts, the latest trends, the foundation knowledge, the tools and so on.

Message-ID: <CAHCS4gHMAZC2u2EOOgyNZCwQLbMMGiR90irnAJ-c4g8z7jP6Cg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This is just for a hobby work. I want to control a hardware device from my
android phone like how a RC toy works. I have hands on with Android. I can
code in python as well. I am planning to purchase a ready-to-assemble robot
kit from a local vendor. And I would like to have an interface with the
robot and my phone over blue tooth. I hope we can create that interface
with Arduino. I don't have any hands on experience with hardwares. Does
anyone have experience with these kind of work before? Can anyone point out
where can I start with?

And also it will be good if you can mention where can I buy appropriate
hardwares. My budget is around 5k.

Most standard robot kits or micro-controller kits won't come with
a Bluetooth interface. Typically you should have some hardware skills
like soldering to attach a Bluetooth module to the robot controller or
micro-controller. Bluetooth modules are available in India here:
http://www.rhydolabz.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=130_132&zenid=33bec775ec53e194fdbf361c65b1cb99


Typical arrangement will be like this:
Micro-controller<->Serial Interface<->Bluetooth Module <------ Over the air
---------> Android phone's Bluetooth subsystem <-> Android Bluetooth API
(RFCOMM)

Most Bluetooth modules are serial drop ins in which case no setup from
software (embedded, micro-controller) is required. Some devices might
require you setup the device from the micro-controller (like device name,
baud rate etc.)

In principle, setting up a Bluetooth link between a mobile phone to a robot
controller or micro controller is not very difficult, but not child's play
either if you are not a micro-controller regular :)

The reason being it is a self signed certificate and not by any of the
Certificate Authorities programmed into your FF.

Being a public server run by the Govt. of India, the site
administrator ought to have installed one issued by a recognized CA.
It does not create a good impression IMO.

What is the Ubuntu version 12.04.x or 12.10.y?  Have you applied the
latest bug updates?

Does the visual display look the same, both in Ubuntu and Windows?

The driver seems very recent because their update date is 03/11/2013.

I think, the driver is conflicting with ethernet controller..

 I have some questions.

Is the ethernet not working from the first boot itself (mean after
installing ubuntu 12.10) or after you made any changes for wireless drives
or something ?

Is the ethernet worked in previous versions of ubunu / fedora / redhat or
any linux distros ?

If it is worked , what is the distro, kernel version and driver?

I think the new intel driver are doesn't have backward compatibility with
your ethernet controller (not sure).

OK. First of all, Go to the directory where you installed e1000e / e1000,
remove the modules by,

make uninstall

And check with kernel driver e1000e itself (Don't use the external driver
downloaded from intel).

 If it is not working again, we have to do some kernel patches to make it
work.

For the Arduino boards you have selected, the following Bluetooth module:
http://kitsnspares.com/user1/productdescription.asp?id=1074
from the same dealer might be a good match.

One problem with Arduino is that the single serial port in the device is
used for programming and monitoring the device from the PC. If you decide
to use the Bluetooth module in serial mode, you need to disconnect and re
connect the BT module every time you program the Arduino. Unless of course
you use the BT module in SPI mode. There is not much technical information
in the kitsnspares website for the BT module.

I had asked a question regarding Oment++ Install in Mac few days back, but
did not get any response. I managed to get it up and running in Linux Mint,
now am trying to integrate components.

I tried integrating ReaSE in Omnet++, from IDE and through command line.
INET built without any errors, except few warnings in Omnet++ IDE itself.
for ReaSE, through IDE, I get some 115 Errors, and building won't happen
(they list errors like : "no such component: IP", some errors regarding
IP_hack etc.). Through command line, 'opp_makemake -...' command
here<https://i72projekte.tm.uka.de/trac/ReaSE/wiki/InstallInet4CommandLine>runs
without error, but 'make' gives following output:

In file included from applications/ddos/TribeFloodNetwork.cc:7:0:

I tried searching for the file, the file doesn't exist in real. I
downloaded the package from ReaSE download

Any solutions?

Subject: [Ilugc] Open Sundays Chennai - Idea Proposal
Message-ID: <BAY173-W4791789F30F3C0E0923C8EA6DD0@phx.gbl>

Hey there,

Geek culture is not something new to Chennai. For years, this city has been home to numerous geeks, developers, bloggers, hackers and a multitude of free software enthusiasts. ?Chennai also has a large number of OSS communities ? much of them being splinter groups. But, the problem inherent to the communities here is that they are small in size, there is no proper outreach medium and above all there is no coordination between the various groups.

Of course, each of us have different motives and goals. But, on the whole, in one way or the other, each community envisions the same thing - promote the web, technology and ?software freedom in an ?open way?. That cannot happen unless we have a unified approach.?

Also, it has been a very long time since Chennai has played host to any big OSS conference, meetup or movement as such. I guess its time we change things.?

This is where we introduce ?Open Sundays? - a day full of activity sprints, unconferences, workshops, talks, hackathons, where various community members, enthusiasts, students and geeks in Chennai region come together - all under a single roof. Open Sundays can provide a great platform for like minded people to come together, promote inter-community coordination and exchange of knowledge and know-how.?

As such, let?s not try to hit big at the very beginning. The event can take place once every two or three months during weekends, preferably Sundays. What we require is a set of rooms - probably an office space with internet connection can get us started. All that we are aiming, is to create a banner under which all the communities in Chennai region can come together and work towards something unique and constructive.?

Let us all be a part of this initiative and create something big. If there are any ideas or suggestions, that you may have to improve this, I?m all ears :)?

Thanks,

Subject: [Ilugc] My experiences with SpamCheetah
Message-ID: <CALDskyzG9gKtMWKpmb_KowLQiNqA5tyjMe2de4OG-5TEUNivhQ@mail.gmail.com>

Actually e-mail flows from one point to another using a text based simple
protocol
 called SMTP.

It has commands like HTTP.

HTTP only has 7 or so out of which normally browsers only use GET, HEAD,
POST
 and so on.

In the case of SMTP the commands are

HELO/HELO
MAIL FROM: <foo at from.org>
RCPT TO: <bar at to.org>
DATA

How are you?

.
QUIT


That is the client part. This SMTP client is actually the SMTP server
 of the sender.

The mail client like Outlook or web mail like hotmail, yahoo! or gmail
 actually sends the mail to the target mail server's port 25.

The target mail server is identified from the MX DNS record of the
 domain of the recipient e-mail ID.

When you type the mail and click send or if you use mutt like me,
 when you type 'y', the mail is first uploaded to the mail server,
stored in a Q and then dispatched to the destination mail server using SMTP.

My product being an e-mail security gateway sits in between the recipient
 mail server and the client mail servers that send mail inward.

So I see a lot of SMTP traffic daily. ;)

I have written a C SMTP proxy that uses UNIX semantics doing a fork(),
 and uses poll(2) to ferry packets between the client and server.

Thereby I receive the whole mail from the SMTP sender and store
 it in a file and then do virus and spam scanning on it.

If it looks alright I read the file and transmit to the mail socket.

In case it looks bad I drop the mail.

That in short is how my product works.

In seeing the SMTP packets on the wire and how mail servers send
 e-mail I find that usual mail size is of the order of 5000 bytes.

And the mail protocol is quite simple to use and understand.

As and when my experience unfolds more info I shall post to LUG.

I have been developing this technology for more than 6 years and
 even today I have not become successful.

I must be really dumb no?
