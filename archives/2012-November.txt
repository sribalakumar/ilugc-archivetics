If feasible it is better to switch from moodle (if you do not require other
functionality of moodle except quiz) and create a custom tool, may be
something around node.js (with nginx as webserver as suggested by others)
or anything that scale well even with less resources.

certainly there are many people on this list can be of help but the
messages are so cryptic as though trying to hide some details and still get
some free help , anyway i have looked around Khanacademy code last year and
now Course builder specifically not to land into these kind of
scaling/maintenance issues , but the flip side is we have to pay Google for
there services and getting ourselves locked in there Environment . I am
also looking at p2pu.org code base as an alternative .

one idea is if the work is of not for profit nature  then Google can give
certain credits.

Tool of the Day: MRTG


The Multi Router Traffic Grapher is a tool primarily used to monitor
the traffic load on network links.MRTG generates HTML pages containing
PNG images which provide a LIVE visual representation of this traffic.
MRTG typically produces daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly graphs.
In addition to monitoring via SNMP, MRTG can also generate graphs
based on the output of any application, allowing one to generate graphs
of anything that needs monitoring (for example, CPU and memory usage,
email volumes, web hits, etc). For faster data collection, MRTG can also
interface to RRDtool.

I configured apache Loadbalancer Using mod_proxy_balancer.

I followed this tutorial

http://www.howtoforge.com/load_balancing_apache_mod_proxy_balancer

I dont know whether apache load balancer can serve 15k concurrent
moodle users. I will post this issue in moodle forum.

Ubuntu Core On The Nexus 7

Jono Bacon writes about plans for the Ubuntu core on Nexus 7 project.
Bacon pointed out very clearly: ?This is not going to be a tablet
Unity interface running on the 8/16GB Nexus 7, but instead will focus
on getting the current Ubuntu Desktop running on the Nexus so that we
can ensure pieces such as the kernel, power management and other
related areas are working effectively on a tablet device.?

Along with the project description, Bacon provides information for
potential project contributors (testers and developers) and points out
the UDS-R session schedule for getting Ubuntu core on Nexus 7.

Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) end-of-life reached on October 28, 2012

Kate Stewart sends out a note ?to confirm that the support period for
Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) formally ends on October 28, 2012 and
Ubuntu Security Notices no longer includes information or updated
packages for Ubuntu 11.04.?

Ubuntu 12.10: Windows 8 for the open source crowd?

John Breeden II of GCN highlights changes to desktop, server and cloud
in Ubuntu 12.10. Breeden states: ?I?ve always thought that Ubuntu was
one of the cleanest flavors of Linux, but it wasn?t always the most
cutting-edge. The release of Ubuntu 12.10 and Ubuntu Server 12.10
could change that, adding more Internet capabilities to the desktop
and more cloud optimization to the server side.? Breeden then reflects
on comments from Canonical CEO Jane Silber that that the new desktop
version of Ubuntu is a good alternative to Microsoft Windows 8.

10 Things To Do After Installing Ubuntu 12.10


After the thrill of downloading it, and the jagged nerves from
installing it, you may be wondering what to do next with your freshly
installed copy of Ubuntu.

That question is especially true if you?re new to Ubuntu or haven?t
used it for a while.

So, to help get you settled, we?ve listed our top 10 post-install must-dos?

Ubuntu Software Development Kit Announced

An important item discussed in Copenhagen this Monday, regarding app
development, was the emergence of an Ubuntu SDK at some point in the
not too distant future.

>From what I've read, there are multiple areas you need to look at.
a) In Linux, the system allows a maximum queue of 100 per port. To
accommodate this, it is recommended that the application/server listen
to multiple ports and IPs.
b) Every TCP connection will take 1KB for a TCP block in memory.
Parsing this table will become slow as number of connections grow. You
will need to fine tune the stack parameters to allow connection blocks
to be dropped fast (FIN time) and a lot others. Enough material on the
web.
c) Apache itself has a hard limit of 256 clients. You will need to
modify MaxClients parameter and maybe
recompile.http://www.mycomputerforum.com/tutorials/Apache_server_limits.html

I've seen recommendations for building apps using asynchronous web
servers and message queuing apps to beat these limited and go upto
500K connections. Your application is going to have 15K connections
that will be kept open for the duration of the test. Maybe worthwhile
to either look at building asynchronous apps or throw more hardware at
the problem.

Subject: [Vtigercrm-developers] Vtiger CRM 6 - Source code on SVN for Early
Access
To: <vtigercrm-developers at lists.vtigercrm.com>

Today we reached an important milestone on the road to Vtiger CRM 6 - we
are pleased to announce the
early access of source code for our developer community to enable extension
development and contributions on the new platform.

SVN: http://trac.vtiger.com/svn/vtiger/vtigercrm/branches/6.0.0

Our primary goals with Vtiger CRM 6 are the following:

   1. Make Vtiger easier to use (UX)
   2. Make Vtiger easier to develop for.

*A long journey*

We started work on Vtiger 6 over 8 months ago. On the UI end we worked off
a fresh slate and arrived at the current design
after several iterations and the continuous process of collecting and
integrating feedback. We then shifted our focus to new libraries,
and refactored some of the server side code to provide a clean interface
for the front-end code.

After more than 10,000 hours of work, we are thrilled to finally release
the code that we've been working on
for your feedback and use in your extension development.

*A brand new UI*

With Vtiger CRM 6, improving usability was our main goal. Completely new
front-end code has been written from ground up using new libraries
(Bootstrap, jQuery...). The new UI aims to provide a better user
experience, while simultaneously making future development for Vtiger
easier.
Developers will, for example, find that it is now quite easy to add new
layouts and skins.

*New features*

On the journey to a better UI, we added some features to improve user
experience:

   1. Module level dashboards
   2. History widget in the dashboard showing recent actions in the CRM
   (updates and comments)
   3. Summary views added to offer useful information at a quick glance (in
   Leads, Contacts, Opportunities, Projects and more modules)

*Key improvements for developers*

   1. New UI follows the MVC model, which is easier to maintain
   2. Simpler folder structure (easy to follow the code)
   3. Simpler structure for Language files
   4. Simpler structure for Themes (layouts) and Skins (colors)

Please refer to the following developer guide for more details.

Developer Guide: https://wiki.vtiger.com/index.php/Vtiger_6_Developer_Guide

*The road ahead*

The following areas are yet to be completed in the new UI

   1. All Settings pages
   2. Calendar sharing, Report Charts, and some minor features
   3. Mail Manager
   4. Dashboard widget for showing custom filters

We plan to release the complete UI overhaul around the end of the year.

*We need your help!*

To ensure the successful release of Vtiger CRM 6, we need your help to:

   - Port extensions to Vtiger 6.
   - Test for gaps in security
   - Validate Vtiger 6 (keep us posted on issues you notice (trac - please
   mark the version as 6.0 ea.))

We plan to have all extensions working with Vtiger CRM 6 by the time of the
GA release.
Receiving early feedback on porting issues will help us ensure that a
strategy and process is in place to make this happen.
We really look forward to working with you in the coming weeks to help make
the public release Vtiger 6 a tremendous success.

Warmest Regards,
The Vtiger Team

Tool of the Day: Kernelcheck

KernelCheck is a graphical user interface program designed to make
the kernel-compiling process as easy as the click of a button. A
kernel is the base of any operating system - in our case, the Linux
operating system. KernelCheck will fetch the latest information from
http://www.kernel.org, which hosts the source packages for the
Linux kernel, and ask the user which one they would like to compile
into a .deb package (with the option of installing the kernel after the
compilation). This automated process is a fork of AutoKernel by
Robert Wolterman (xtacocorex), Timothy Janssen (mentok), and
Kristof Verbeken (PingunZ). KernelCheck is currently licensed under
the GNU Public License version 3.

AutoIt is for windows, it may start with the WINE, but all the scripts and
functionalities will not work with it.

You can also try AutoKey(http://code.google.com/p/autokey/) or SIKULI(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikuli) for Linux. SIKULI is more powerful
tool than AutoIt and it can be used in all the platform.

Topic: Discussion on India's IT Rules and threat to Internet

Description: The recent rules notified by the Government under the
Information Technology Act, 2000 regarding
intermediaries affect bloggers, online media and intermediaries by placing
stringent controls on
content that can be posted online. The rules have the potential to be used
as a means to censor the
internet through the back door and could have chilling effects on free
speech and dissemination of
information. The rules also go far beyond the IT Act, under which the rules
have been framed, and
have provisions that affect the fundamental rights of citizens including the
right to freedom of
speech and expression as well as the right to privacy.

Duration: 30 Minutes

Tool of the Day: Valgrind

Valgrind is a GPL'd tool to help you find memory-management
problems in your programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's
supervision, all reads and writes of memory are checked, and calls
to malloc/new/free/delete are intercepted. Valgrind can debug more
or less any dynamically-linked ELF x86/Linux, amd64/Linux and
ppc/Linux executables, without modification, recompilation, or anything.

Valgrind provides a generic infrastructure for supervising the execution
of programs called "tools". This is done by providing a way to instrument
programs in very precise ways, making it relatively easy to support
activities
such as dynamic error detection and profiling. The Valgrind distribution
currently includes three tools: a memory error detectors, a cache (time)
profiler and a heap (space) profiler.

version: 1:3.7.0-0ubuntu3
size: 31.7 MB to download, 117.7 MB when installed

Subject: [Ilugc] A brief look at OpenBSD pf firewall
Message-ID: <CALDskywWD25vVhiKdJThdA+zLx__4+dTC-+LN7c3VF0EVmvc8Q@mail.gmail.com>

pfSense is  a fairly successful and popular open source project built with
FreeBSD.

The name is derived from pf which came from OpenBSD.

And I wonder why nobody ever confused Sreya with Simran or Sneha but
everybody thinks OpenBSD is FreeBSD.

FreeBSD is completely different. It sounds similar and some things are
similar, that is all.

So OpenBSD pf is a kernel firewall subsystem. That is backported to other
operating systems like NetBSD and FreeBSD as well.

In the case of pfSense firewall the web interface acts as a config tool
like cPanel or something to write the backend pf firewall rules.

OpenBSD pf rules are really easy , readable and pleasant.

You can easily implement a NAT device, a simple URL blocker, a  port
forwarding. DNAT rule or give restricted access to certain local hosts.

In the following days we will look at each of the features this firewall
offers.

But for you to try it you have to install OpenBSD.

Don't be happy with pfSense or FreeBSD.

This is the real thing.

@ Girish - great ...  but I suggest that you put such articles in a blog
(there are many free sites) and give us a link to them.   IMO, that would
be more beneficial to the FOSS world.

Additionally, you will get more global exposure and also feedback from all
corners of the world.

I don't see anything wrong with Shrinivasan's mail. It is about Linux and
Open Source. That's it. And the subject clearly says "commercial". Those
interested will subscribe. Others will just ignore.

Hi

When I try to watch a video on my ipod touch the video never takes time to
buffer and the quality is also really good,  However when I try to do the
same with my laptop on the same internet connection it takes lots of time
for buffering,  When I reduce the picture quality to less than 360 then it
work fine however the quality of the picture is lost.  How can I get to
play the same video on my lapi without the buffer time ?

I find that your post is very insightful on this. Can you give me links to more 
on scaling to 15K request with apache. I have worked on servers serving greater 
than 15K request. But those were more complex setup. Not like single server 
trying to server 15k . It was a farm of servers serving 15k+ request behind a 
hardware loadbanlancer with tuned kernel and geographically distributed servers 
split into multiple components. Can you give me article that talk more on those 
numbers you have said, like, 256 clients and 100 per port.

This may be due to tearing. Try to use a lower resolution. Screen shot will
be clear as it takes copy of the framebuffer (available in RAM) and not
from the monitor.

Hope this helps,

Ideally, you could use AWS/EC2 platform to host such infrastructure which
could scale up/down as required , throw it away when done and just pay for
what you use.

Few inputs:
- AWS offers Elastic Load Balancer which is massively scalable.
- You could split your application into Apache | NFS \ Backend DB and scale
each part individually.
- Use In memory cache such as memcache for db,  varnish for http cache.
This will reduce the load on the backend servers a lot.
- Use Autoscaling to scale up and down as your traffic changes
- Use spot instances for web servers with autoscaling. You will end up
doing considerable cost savings.


I have not setup scalable infrastructure for moodle in specific, but have
done it for multitude of other LAMP stacks such as magento, drupal, custom
php apps and so on.  Each has its own specific challenges, but underlyting
architecture  remain same.

The recent arrest of a businessman in Puducherry for making a comment
on twitter about Karti Chidambaram is a classic example of how the
vague provisions of the IT Act can be used by the poweful to harass people.
What the businessman seems to have said is a comment made in many
forums...this  kind of harassment is truly unfortunate...More on the issue

http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/iac-volunteer-tweets-himself-into-trouble-faces-three-years-in-jail/article4051769.ece

The operative part..

"If you write a book that annoys or inconveniences me, even deliberately,
I have no civil or criminal recourse. But if you send an e-mail message,
or post a tweet, you could face three years in jail", says lawyer Pranesh
Prakash. "That's higher than the two-year imprisonment for causing death
by negligence."

Tool of the Day: OProfile

OProfile is a performance profiling tool for Linux systems, capable of
profiling all running code at low overhead. It consists of a daemon
for collecting sample data, plus several post-profiling tools for
turning data into information.
OProfile leverages the hardware performance counters of the CPU
to enable profiling of a wide variety of interesting statistics, which
can also be used for basic time-spent profiling. All code is profiled:
hardware and software interrupt handlers, kernel modules, the
kernel, shared libraries, and applications (the only exception being
the OProfile interrupt handler itself). Note that different
architectures can use different hardware mechanisms to collect
data.


version: OProfile 0.9.8

Subject: [Ilugc] Simple pf rules
Message-ID: <CALDskyxXSZ+5hqF57b0rkW7wLCMApPVfkDv-3QGGraoHu=gfKg@mail.gmail.com>

Let us begin with simple rules.

All rules in the firewall are written into the file /etc/pf.conf
 and the rules are loaded with the command pfctl.

Let us start.

How to do simple NAT?

# cat /etc/pf.conf
pass out on egress from 192.168.1.0/24 to !192.168.1.0/24 nat-to 5.5.5.5

# pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

will load the NAT rule.

And to see the rule, you type:

# pfctl -sr

sr stands for show rules.

Normally pf is useful only on multihomed hosts. Machines
 with more than one egress interface, physical network
' interface to send and receive packets.

You can setup a simple firewall with these rules.

# cat /etc/pf.conf

set skip on lo
block all

table <allowed>  {
    2.3.4.50
    2.4.5.200
}

pass out on egress from $local_net to <allowed>

#pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

We will look at other rules later.

For now just see if you can get things working at this level.

That's because you are trying to extrapolate lesser pixels onto a larger
number of pixels.

Option 1. Upgrade to a faster internet connection.
Option 2: try using a lower resolution monitor

Pandaboard is capable of the handling high resolution. Please make
sure in Kernel, the OMAP-DSS is configured to handle your Monitor
Resolution mode. Are you connecting the display using HDMI or using
any converter boards like chalk?

In Ubuntu edit the sudoers file in /etc folder, you can come across allow
members of group sudo to execute any command. There you insert a new text
"username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: command path to execute like /sbin/shutdown
etc..".

Also make sure the user is in standard account privilege.

I would add one more thing - create a group, restrict this group to
the set of commands.  Make it the primary group for all users under
such restriction.

Hi Ravi,

Go through the below steps,


1. Create the restricted shell

cp /bin/bash /bin/rbash


2. Modify the target user for the shell as restricted shell

for new user
useradd -s /bin/rbash localuser
for existing user
usermod -s /bin/rbash localuser


3. Create a directory under /home/localuser, e.g. programs

mkdir /home/localuser/programs

4. Now if you check, the user localuser can access all commands which
he/she has allowed to execute. These commands are taken from the
environmental PATH variable which is set in
/home/localuser/.bash_profileModify it as follows.

# cat /home/localuser/.bash_profile
# .bash_profile

# Get the aliases and functions
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
. ~/.bashrc
fi
# User specific environment and startup programs
PATH=$HOME/programs
export PATH
Here the PATH variable is set to ~/programs directory, as /usr/local/bin is
binded to /home/username/bin and /bin is binded to /home/username/bin so
replacing that


5. Now after logging with the username localuser, user cant run a simple
command too. The output will be like this,

6. Now create the softlinks of commands which are required for user
localuser to execute in the directory /home/localuser/programs

    ln -s /bin/date /home/localuser/programs/
    ln -s /bin/ls /home/localuser/programs/

now user can execute only date and ls command. likewise you add the
commands you want

Thanks for your comments,

ACL helped me out.  Removed the specific commands rwx permission  for the
user. That's it problem solved.,

Eg: User 'ravi' should not be allowed to run rm command in his default
shell

setfacl -m u:ravi:--- /bin/rm

Give the exact command line you used to list the file.

Try the  -Q and -b options in ls.

Message-ID: <CACm7z1aCkrubAk+9Z_73YZ8Pr9wak=ckFxXrbgTeay6zJL26SQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Marco Tempest - who calls himself a Virtual Magician uses Technology to
create Magic tricks of this Era. I hope some of you might have seen his
video's at TED.

For those who missed, check out his latest trick, He is using OpenCV to
achieve it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX8MBBohX3s

And at one of his previous video he said, he wants to take this to all by
using Open source tools and allowing people to Innovate by contributing
ideas.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ8eyWBQmfU

And here in this video he shows the Open source tools that he uses

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABBBUgy1--o

This clearly shows Open Source has the leading edge on Augmented reality.

I have seen similar behaviour in vt100 terminal days. It happens when the filename contains some escape characters (non-printable)
doing ls -l >someoutput may show it.

Tool of the Day: Munin


Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create
graphs of virtually everything imaginable throughout your network,
while still maintaining a rattling ease of installation and
configuration.
This package contains the grapher/gatherer. You will only need one
instance of it in your network. It will periodically poll all the nodes in
your network it's aware of for data, which it in turn will use to create
graphs and HTML pages, suitable for viewing with your graphical
web browser of choice.
It is also able to alert you if any value is outside of a preset
boundary, useful if you want to be alerted if a filesystem is about to
grow full, for instance. You can do this by making Munin run an
arbitrary command when you need to be alert it, or make use of the
intrinsic Nagios support.
Munin is written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's excellent
RRDtool.

version: munin 1.4.6-3ubuntu3.1

Those are installed from your distribution. Please don't make any
changes to them. You can put custom templates in your ~/.texmf folder.

After adding custom files, you need to run:

  $ texhash

Thanks,
Vijay.

Subject: [fsug-tvm] News: Python Blaze. Power tool for FOSS maths
To: "Free Software Users Group,  Thiruvananthapuram" <ilug-tvm at googlegroups.com>


Hi everyone,
  We have a new development which could be a giant leap for FOSS
numerical computing (a la matlab, mathematica). It also calls for and
requires participation of FOSS community -especially CS and math
enthusiasts and those who need a replacement for matlab (those who are
interested, please read the end).

A company named Continuum Analytics is developing a numerical
computing engine called 'Blaze' for python language. It is touted as
the next generation of Numpy. For anyone who doesn't know yet, Numpy
is a library that makes it possible to do Matlab type matrix
calculations in python. Continuum Analytics is headed by Travis
Oliphant - the creator of Numpy.

What is new in Blaze?
I got to read some of the early docs for Blaze. Here are some of my
early impressions. It is a generalization of numpy concepts, and has a
fresh new data model and computing paradigm.

Data model:
The data model of Blaze has arrays/tables that combine concepts of
software like numpy, pandas, pytables and theano. Its features are:

1. You can combine multiple data buffers (called chunks) into a single
array or table. These chunks can include RAM buffers, GPGPU buffers,
hard disk locations and even network streams. This makes it possible
to defines infinitely huge arrays. Numpy could accept only arrays
which span a single RAM buffer, and pytables used to handle storage.

2. You have array/tables whose rows or columns can be tagged by name
(like python maps). For example you can name columns as time,
temperature, pressure etc. This was a feature provided by Pandas and R
language.

3. The 'Dtype' of numpy is generalized and extended. Dtype defines how
raw data buffers in memory have to be interpreted. As a consequence,
you will be able to define arrays with very complex type layout.

Computation model:
The computation engine (for crunching numbers defined by the arrays)
is designed like a virtual machine that accepts python inputs. Its
features are:

1. It can be optimized for the target processing system. For example,
different algorithms can be evolved for CPUs, SMPs (ie, multicore
processors), clusters, GPGPUs, DSPs or vector processors (like Intel
MIC, Nvidia Fermi, Adapteva Parallela).

2. It supports 'Lazy evaluation' - a very significant feature which
makes blaze behave like Mathematica, Sympy or maxima. Numpy presently
evaluates expressions as soon as they are executed. Blaze on the other
hand by default, will wait until an evaluation is forced. What this
means is that when you write a blaze expression in python (like x = a
+ b,  y = x**2), blaze will create a data structure called AST
(abstract syntax tree) instead of executing the specified operation.
AST is a machine representation of the expression. ASTs from multiple
expressions are combined (you will get y = {a+b}**2 ), and finally
executed when a result is required.
This allows optimization of expressions before evaluation - for
example (a*b + a*c) can be optimized as (a*(b+c)), since
multiplication is expensive. You also get advantage of symbolic
mathematics- for example, when you do sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2, you can
get an array of 1s without even evaluating the expression.

Blaze has many more features like these, but I could figure out only
these so far. An official announcement is yet to come. To know more
about Blaze, you can refer these:

1. Slides presented for PyCon:
https://github.com/ContinuumIO/blaze/raw/master/slides.pdf

2. Docs within blaze repositories:
    Principles:
https://github.com/ContinuumIO/ArrayServer/blob/master/docs/principles.txt
    NDTables doc:
https://github.com/ContinuumIO/ArrayServer/blob/master/docs/ndtable.rst

3. GitHub repositories:
    https://github.com/ContinuumIO/blazeprototype
    https://github.com/ContinuumIO/ArrayServer

 Blaze could boost FOSS numerical computing if done successfully. It
will create a powerful and versatile numerics tool for multiple target
machines. But there is a catch. Continuum Analytics is a company with
commercial interests. In the principles.txt document, they state that
they intend to publish the specifications for blaze and a 'reference
implementation' as open source, but an optimized version will be
closed source. This is just like Bittorrent, whose protocol is open,
but the canonical implementation is closed. Other developers have
produced good free implementations like Transmission. Just like that,
blaze will require optimized free implementations for various
backends. There is a need for developers to step up to this and there
is good opportunity too. For example, someone could do an
implementation for Intel MIC or a DSP coprocessor as a college project
(a very large one).

If anyone is interested, please share your comments. More insights on
the design documentation, your thoughts about the project, and
expression of interest are welcome.

Regards,
Gokul Das

For pdflatex, version should be high enough.

Creating new packages and contributing them to Debian is another good idea.

Check out this thread to find out how Praveen (a debian developer) and
friends are mentoring students from an Engineering College in Kerala:

Their efforts have resulted in perhaps getting the first woman Debian

I appreciate your enthusiasm for finding interesting tools and sharing
them.  Some of your posts has been a memory jogger for me.

However, do a look at the project activity.   The last activity on the
web site is 2008.

I have been using LAM (LDAP Account Manager - a PHP based Web UI).
It integrates with openLDAP (with Samba schema) pretty well.   For the
CLI enthusiasts - smbldaptools suite works well.

Also, with the eminent release of Samba4, we may have other options
for deploying and managing DSs.

Thanks,

From:   Free Software Foundation <info at fsf.org>



Hello,

Yesterday /WIRED Magazine/ published RMS's newest article on software
patents. In "Let?s Limit the Effect of Software Patents, Since We Can?t
Eliminate Them," Richard Stallman points out the failings of familiar
half-baked attempts at reforming software patents and proposes a new
solution that cuts to the core of the problem.

You can read the article at:
http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/11/richard-stallman-software-patents/

    This approach doesn?t entirely invalidate existing computational
    idea patents, because they would continue to apply to
    implementations using special-purpose hardware. This is an advantage
    because it eliminates an argument against the legal validity of the
    plan. The U.S. passed a law some years ago shielding surgeons from
    patent lawsuits, so that even if surgical procedures are patented,
    surgeons are safe. That provides a precedent for this solution.

    Software developers and software users need protection from patents.
    This is the only legislative solution that would provide full
    protection for all.

    We could then go back to competing or cooperating ? without the fear
    that some stranger will wipe away our work.

This is a radical and exciting idea, and there's already some
interesting discussion around it in the article comments. We encourage
you to join in and advocate for serious action against software patents.
You can also help out by participating in these threads:

Tool of the Day: AIDE Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment

AIDE is an intrusion detection system that detects changes to files
on the local system. It creates a database from the regular
expression rules that it finds from the config file. Once this database
is initialized it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has
several message digest algorithms (md5, sha1, rmd160, tiger,
haval, etc.) that are used to check the integrity of the file. More
algorithms can be added with relative ease. All of the usual file
attributes can also be checked for inconsistencies.
This package contains the statically linked binary for "normal"
systems.
You will almost certainly want to tweak the configuration file in
/etc/aide/aide.conf or drop your own config snippets into
/etc/aide/aide.conf.d.

Hello Members,

The Centre for Internet & Society, Bangalore is hosting a talk by Erik 
Moeller, Vice President of Engineering and Product Development at the 
Wikimedia Foundation, at its office in Bangalore on November 12, 2012, 
from 11.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m., followed by a lunch discussion.

Talk Summary:
Wikipedia's technology platform is rapidly changing, with improvements 
being deployed every day. Unlike other top websites, Wikipedia is run by 
a non-profit (Wikimedia Foundation) and all its technology is open 
source, ready to be improved and extended by you.

Learn about the recent and coming technology changes to Wikipedia and 
Wikimedia's other projects: the new Visual Editor, improvements to 
mobile sites and apps, Wikidata, and projects with mysterious codenames 
like "Echo", "Milkshake", "Agora" and "Flow". Learn how to get involved 
and ask anything you'd like to know about Wikipedia.

This event is public and free to attend, so no registration is required.

I would appreciate if you could share your thoughts/ experiences with
integrating a payment gateway in to a portal (based on a CMS like
Joomla/ Drupal).

I am specifically interested in Vendor that

(a) support sites based on the FOSS stack.
(b) provide documentation to their API and/or sample code,
(c) are easy to do business with etc.  (cost, release of funds,
problem resolution).

Preference is to go with an IN based vendor.

TIA.

Subject: [Ilugc] FreeBSD
Message-ID: <CALDskywMMV6Q3y78ziPt_a9Lej8GObn55Ow0E33vxwbtpvQVLA@mail.gmail.com>

It is more than 5 years since I used FreeBSD for pleasure or business.

Now I am doing a ZFS encryption project and I now run it for everything.

For LUGgies scared of OpenBSD FreeBSD may be a good change from Linux and
its various issues with kernel compilation, network and audio drivers and
incompatibilities, crashes and package installation blues.

In fact FreeBSD is pleasant from the surface though of course if you go
deep inside and dig the kernel and base system you may not like it.

But I think there are very good C programmers here, so that question does
not arise.

Overall I think FreeBSD gave me skype(not in OpenBSD) which I use for my
business, I had audio recording and playback working out of the box.
Browser plays flash videos from youtube, also mp4 I guess just like
OpenBSD. Sometimes I have to download with youtube-dl python script.

mplayer can avail the Xvideo extention. I have certain BSD semantics that I
can feel comfortable, for instance the ports system and package tools
though they are similar only on the surface.

In fact all BSDs share a common history and over the years they have grown
very different mostly due to different cultures and focus areas in the dev
community.

Even in a family you have different family members with different cultures.
So having different cultures is very much like approaching God...

>From the lowest fetishism to the highest absolutism has a place in Hinduism
says Vivekananda.

Today DragonFlyBSD has come along. I have never used it.

There is an idea that Apple OS uses Mach kernel and is derived from
FreeBSD. I have no experience with Apple and I dunno if that claim is
meaningful.

To conclude FreeBSD is pleasant and gives me the same experience and in
some ways better than Debian does.

I have dabbled with phpldapadmin.   Personally, I have found the LAM
WebUI more intuitive and easier to use.

An answer to "What is ERP?"  *cannot* be short and simple in any language (IMO).

I would suggest that you understand what is ERP (search erp and read
the hits)please search erp) from an business/enterprise point of view.
  What are the workflows and processes, inventory, raw material, bill
of material, sales order, invoicing, CRM, SCM and more.

openERP is a application suite that has modules to help you implement
the business process of an enterprise.

@amachu - you may want to add to this.

you think of an organization, it has many things to take care.

sales, purchase, warehouse, human beings, manufacturing, accounts and many more.

each of these have their own work-flows/ processes defined and followed.

each will have group of people or departments to take care of each one of these.

to manage an organization without an ERP would require lot of clerks, paper works and time.

with ERP it happens, over click of a mouse.

a software that helps in efficiently managing an enterprise is OpenERP.

It comes with a Web interface (CherryPy framework) & Client interface (Gtk+) and picking up good these days. You don't have to worry about these, unless you want to develop OpenERP itself.

You need to learn Python, Object Relational Mapping, PostgreSQL, XML for views and RML for reports. And when it comes to real time deployment, much deeper understanding of all these would be needed.

Better to take up subscription from OpenERP at serious cases.

Overall it gives you a framework and in almost all cases we end up customizing it following steps at: http://doc.openerp.com/v6.1/developer/index.html#book-develop-link

Start with small steps, like installing a particular module say sales, understand its entire workflow, think of a change like adding a new field, functionality etc., try achieving it.

for the module that you have learnt functionally, there are apps that extend or modify its core features at: http://apps.openerp.com/

Download few of them, install and go through their code. Understand how they inherit another module and the changes are implemented. This is what you will end up doing practically unless you create your own fork like Tryton :-)

You know what a module and package is in Python you are all set to go after this ;-)

Please prefix a [JOBS] tag to your subject line.

Also there is no such thing as "writing rhel."
Do you mean code contribution to RHEL or taking the certification exam?

Subject: List of still incomplete languages for Debian Installer...
To: debian-i18n at lists.debian.org


There has recently been a great effort by many translators (and me!)
to get as many complete translations as possible in D-I.

Out of 70 supported languages, there are currently 55 where ALL
strings are translated. This is the highest number we ever had for
100%.

Still, we have a few languages that are not so far from being complete
but aren't.

For most of these languages, I tried as hard as possible to ping
people who contributed to these translations, in order to  get them
completed. While it succeeded for some, it failed forsome others.

So, here's the list. If by any chance you happen to be someone
speaking one of these languages, you're very welcomed to try bringing
them to 100%. Of course, the lower the current translation ratio is,
the harder it will be...:-)

Lituanian: 99%
Bosnian: 98%
Tamil: 98%
Lao: 97%
Icelandic: 95%
Macedonian: 95%
Dzongkha: 94%
Nepali: 84%
Norwegian Nynorsk: 84%
Albanian: 83%
Alharic: 82%
Kurdish: 82%
Tagalog: 78%
Wolof: 75% (language currently disabled because too many important
       strings missing)
Tibetan: 49% (enabled because it has the most important strings translated)

It might also help to be consistent about your identity! With an email id
like lobestar, attaching a name like 'Priya' to it and signing off as
purushothaman makes one wonder if you are using someone else's id!!

You must first get approved from the ministry of Information Technology to
ask question in technical form like this one. Next you must be certified as
a terrorist from ministry of home affairs and must know to make pizzas and
masala vadai while driving a car simultaneously must have ability to
operate AK-47.

These qualification is absolutely must to ask question. And you must have
never see color blue after you have asked a question because we consider it
offensive as it was the default color of microsoft desktop for a long time.

You move biz process to electronic format, so that things can be data-mined
and paper work can be avoided and hopefully things become more efficient
and automated. Thats ERP.

dear all
   thank you very much for your reply.
i am an electrical engineer in an nuclear  power station.
we take vvibration readings and pump temperatures in a week for monitoring
purpose and putit in ms excel for comparision
rows we have description of the parameter and column will have dates..
i wanted to put it in php- mysql .
mysql accepts a record as a row.
i wanted a help to display as we do it ms excel.
any script or any tutorial will do.

----m.purushothaman
----------- quote ends--------

Is the mail from Priya or Purushothaman?

Anyway all you have to do is convert the data to simple CSV format, comma
separated
 values and you can import it in MS Excel.

Figure out how to do it.

Google is your God.

Tool of the Day: Snort

Snort is a libpcap-based packet sniffer/logger which can be used as
a lightweight network intrusion detection system. It features rules
based logging and can perform content searching/matching in
addition to being used to detect a variety of other attacks and
probes, such as buffer overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks,
SMB probes, and much more. Snort has a real-time alerting
capability, with alerts being sent to syslog, a separate "alert" file, or
even to a Windows computer via Samba.
This package provides the plain-vanilla version of Snort and does
not provide database (available in snort-pgsql and snort-mysql)
support.

version: snort 2.9.2-3ubuntu1
size: 2.1 MB to download, 11.2 MB when installed

It has lost it ability to support database as it needs to work on analyzing
the traffic which is captured.  barnyard2 is the program which takes the
output of snort and updates the mysql database.

dear all
 thank you very much for your replies
i think i have not clearly expressed my problem
i am using windows xp os with wamp server
in mysql i have created a database and a table
through php myadmin
the table is having  fileds -date, pump to brg temperature, bottom brg 
temperature, vibration level and so on
through a html form iam  filling these datas daily
each day values is getting stored as a row.
when  a query is being given with select statement  between to dates result 
is coming in rows
my doubt is whether the table can be displayed vertically ie decription in 
first column  and results for firstdate in second column and so on  so that 
for comparision it is easy between dates
i prayed  GOOGLE  GOD  no result
 hope i have explained my problem
i will be happy if somebody is helping me
thanks in advance

to begin with have proper subject lines in your mails

right now it is displayed like this

Date  |Pump to brg | temp bottom brg |  temp |  vibration level

using a SQL statement you can create r view read more from here
http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp and figure out the statement.

First of all +1 on a proper subject line.   If you continue with your

This should come from your functional specifications/requirements.
Prima facie, it appears you are coding first and your design (UI/UX)
is an after thought.

Google is not  God.   The search engines are designed by humans and
are subject to flaws just as we are.

Having said this, searches are based on key words/phrases.  You  have
not shared what key words you used in your search effort(s).   Perhaps
the problem lies there in.

You need to establish your identity.

Are you priya or are you purushothaman?   Some people use an online
handle but they are consistent with it though.

To me it appears like an identity crisis for whoever is "lobestar at gmail.com"

Its a matter of displaying the query results. Not sure where exactly you
are facing a problem. Probably a code snippet should get more help.

It definitely is a win that gnu/linux is the base operating system.
However, IMHO, in systems of this type, the integration tools on top of
the base operating system weigh more. Most of the performance gains come
from how those tools are built. Not sure how many of such tools are Free
Software.

With gnu/linux in the bottom and a whole stack of proprietary stuff on
top is not exactly a win for the community, IMHO.

What I did was to convert PDFs to epub format on my Linux desktop using
Calibre and import it into Aldiko. It then stores it into it's bookshelf.
More convenient than having one app per book.

To:

Hi

It's time to get ready for Shaastra 2013, the annual technical fest of IIT
Madras. We, from the Shaastra team, proudly present to you, the FOSS event
at Shaastra: Hackfest.

What is Hackfest all about?
Hackfest is more than a FOSS event. To us, it's a movement to gather
enthusiastic programmers together and get them on the tracks of open source
development. It teaches them the sleight of the developer's hand and gives
them a chance to peek into the world of development.

Hackfest's Objective:
Our primary objective is to help the participants take their first steps
into the world of contribution to open source.

Past glories:
Over the past three years Hackfest has been a fantastic way to gather
enthusiastic programmers together and get them started on contributing to
open source projects. It gave an opportunity for the participants to learn
what separates developers from regular users and coders and to interact
with the Indian open source community. In the previous editions of the
Hackfest, participants have fixed bugs and have even got patches! This has
had a lasting effect; some of the participants have enthusiastically begun
to contribute to their favorite Open Source projects, and have participated
in the Google Summer of Code.

What's new this year?
We have workshops on 4 renowned software projects this year : Tor, GNU
Mailman, KDE and Django; where participants will be mentored by experienced
developers (1 per project) who can guide them through their baby steps into
the FOSS world.

Registrations are open. Visit us at
http://www.shaastra.org/2013/main/#!events/hackfest

Hope to see you there!
Have fun hacking.

Subject: [Ilugc] What is the difference between OpenGL and CGAL ?
Message-ID: <CACm7z1YwCYS+=nFEBqSPwqbyNOvJJC5SywGMspcsqmZ-7ffSRw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

We have OpenGL [1] - Open Graphics Library which consists of libraries
written in C / C++ which touches GPU for 2D/3D rendering.
We also have CGAL [2] - Computational Geometry Algorithms Library which is
also written in C++ and that consists of libraries for carrying out
Geometric algorithms.

I am not able to understand if both are dependent on each other or both
does the same work in their own way using C++ as primary language.

One thing I understood is CGAL consists of set of algorithms for carrying
out Geometric operations and these algorithms are also implemented in C++
and available as a library which can be used by calling it's functions,
whereas with OpenGL, we need to implement those algorithms programatically
if needed ( Correct me, if I am wrong, even in this sense).

[1] - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL & http://www.opengl.org/about/
[2] - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGAL & http://www.cgal.org/

If someone could help me out in this regard, thanks in advance.

OpenGL is a set of API that exposes the graphics card capabilities.
Graphics cards just offload and accelerate all graphics related operations
(from drawing simple lines, curves to complex lighting or other effects).
These can be done with CPUs also but it will be way slower than Graphics
cards as graphics cards are designed for this purpose. (Using CPU is like
implementing multiply and divide instruction using addition and subtraction
in software, using graphics card is like using the multiply and divide
instruction provided by the processor.)

I think in CGAL things are done using CPU. This seems to be another set of
API. If you wish you can implement CGAL API such that it will use graphics
card for doing the computations instead of the CPU.

Both are APIs exposed for different purpose (there may be some over lap)
and both can be implemented using CPU or GPU - performance will differ
drastically.

Message-ID: <CALDskywe1bSRBXWcJxDbTrtDP6PwpiBidU9zksEOpDM4HY9fnw@mail.gmail.com>

tmux is a great program.

The developer was directly invited to become an OpenBSD
dev by Theo.

He is no ordinary chap. The innovations done by him are
 simply dumbfounding.

The most interesting is his ability to display the currently executing

It also shows a colorful status bar with other info.

Here is a screenshot.

http://spam-cheetah.com/downloads/tmux.png

tmux is terminal multiplexor which means you can run multiple
 shell programs in the foreground you can split a window into
 vertical and horizontal panes.

This is quite sexy. For a long time I did not know it.

Here are shots:

The biggest use of this great idea originally envisaged by
 the author of screen(1), a great way to do the same thing
 albeit in a somewhat less capable way than tmux.

The biggest use is that this is a default nohup capability
 added to your playing music or download.

If your machine powers down or your network cuts the
 remote ssh session will continue to do your job if you run your commands
using tmux.

Another fun thing is that you can connect to it from anywhere and continue
the session.

tmux also helps you to do remote debugging and support
 conferencing in which you collaborate with others or even
 demo your code.

In other words this is a text mode teamviewer.

you can script this and do various other things.

But the clock on the bottom in the default green status
 bar is good enough for me.

Message-ID: <CAFHFDAkY+aoj0Lk3=Qu+m=bNkFk0_GkjbVTMoy7y6A75iGkf0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have an Intel P4 machine with mercury motherboard which I got in 2004,
It has 1GB DDR1 with no other features,  Recently I connected a 1080P LED
monitor to it.

This machine would not install any of the linux distros except for Debian
6.0.1 or RHEL5 :-( and the response from the computer is also very
sluggish.

I asked for suggestion in ILUG-C meeting and as per the advise

1. I did try to reduce the resolution size to 1024x768 it did take away
some amount of sluggishness however mp4 videos are not playing on it.
2. I even installed xfce as per the suggestion and tried to play the video
still the same result.

Is there some way by which I can fix this ?  How can I find out what is
wrong or is that machine really that old ?

What is the clock speed of the CPU?  Also the chip set make a
difference to the performance.

I have a P4 (2.4GHz) with 1GB RAM - mobo is some generic brand that I
cannot recall.   Response time for desktop apps is slow but
acceptable.  I have not tried playing any multi media stuff on it
though.

Have you tried DSL on this system?  <http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/>

Okay I know your problem.Unless the Xvideo extension works nothing will
work.

xvinfo will help. This uses the GPU in the mobo.

Really the monitor is idiotic info, it is like my friend said,I connected a
speaker LG brand and
 the sound card does not work. ;)

Subject: [Ilugc] Using starttls with twisted
Message-ID: <CAMbkTg+2Ps5PL_gCCULnt5J_eEH+U7vbQ8GVUYrTDTa4hR3jdg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

           I am creating a simple SMTP server that would handle TLS
connections as well. I am doing this to test some stuff at office. I
am using twisted, and the basic plain text part works fine. But I run
into issues when I use STARTTLS. When I use starttls(I tried with
openssl s_client), openssl says SSL Handshake failure. Captures show
that the script sends a FIN, ACK.


 My code for tls looks like this.

tls_context = SMTPTLSContext(privateKeyFileName = something.key,
certificateFileName=somthing.pem)
self.transport.startTLS(tls_context, SMTPServerFactory())


SMTPServerFactory inherits Factory and runs the SMTPServer class. This
Factory class works fine(when tested with plain text emails)

SMTPTLSContext is like this:

class SMTPTLSContext(ssl.DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kw):
        kw['sslmethod'] = SSL.TLSv1_METHOD
        ssl.DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory.__init__(self, *args, **kw)


I guess the FIN,ACK is because of the self.transport.startTLS() method
starting off a new SMTPServerFactory instance. Can someone help me on
how to implement the STARTTLS part of it ? Thanks

You're really mistaken here. Do give it a try. And since these distros are
optimised for low power PC's, they're likely to run much better.

Oh no, I did not mean the ISO organization.

tmux is not that all great idea as you are describing. tmux simply builds upon 
the idea of program called screen. I dont know how improving upon a idea can be 
called a great program. screen has been around for long long time.

runs on Debian and backups many systems on the LAN?  Consider Bacula

         If the improvements make the job easier/better it certainly
can be called a great program. For eg, the GUI, originally was an
improvement over the command line interface, but there are millions of
people who call GUIs great, but look down upon command line
interface!. Thanks

Agree. Largely commandline but I think I saw some GUI for it too. In
case you are looking at a two way sync over rsync, unison performs
very well. Have used it for a long time.

I would suggest the following:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LuckyBackup
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicati_%28software%29
Both are based on Rsync only with very good GUI

Also, go thru the following good URL:

http://www.freehackers.org/Backup

All the best and post your experiences

Tool of the Day: Wireshark

   Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for
networktroubleshooting, analysis,
software and communications protocol development, and education. Originally
named Ethereal, in May
2006 the project was renamed Wireshark due to trademark issues.
   Wireshark is cross-platform, using the GTK+ widget toolkit to implement
its user interface, and
using pcap to capture packets; it runs on various Unix-likeoperating systems
including Linux, Mac OS X, BSD, and Solaris.


   - Data can be captured "from the wire" from a live network connection
   or read from a file thatrecorded already-captured packets.
   - Live data can be read from a number of types of network, including
   Ethernet, IEEE 802.11, PPP, and loopback.
   - Captured network data can be browsed via a GUI, or via the terminal
   (command line) version of the utility, TShark.
   - Captured files can be programmatically edited or converted via
   command-line switches to the "editcap" program.
   - Data display can be refined using a display filter.
   - Plug-ins can be created for dissecting new protocols.
   - VoIP calls in the captured traffic can be detected. If encoded in a
   compatible encoding, the media flow can even be played.
   - Raw USB traffic can be captured.

rsnapshot

It's a wrapper script over rsync but it gives you "time machine" like
functionality and you can see what a particular file looked last night or
last week or last month or last year depending on how long you configure it
to maintain hourly/daily/weekly/monthly snapshots.

When reviewing software it helps to be grounded. Leave the superlatives to a
certain fruit company that makes "magical" products.

Just because someone has done great things doesn't mean everything he does is
awesome/should be praised sky high.
(You've not even mentioned this "no ordinary chap"'s name.)

GNU Screen does all that too and has been around since 1987. (25 years!) So
tmux is just a rehash/clone of a 25 year old program and probably an even
older concept.

Ignorance isn't a feature/doesn't make a product better.

This is something that is absolutely baseless and I have been hearing from
every single person that has "discovered" tmux. 

As someone who has been using "GNU Screen" since my initial foray into Linux
(~15 years now), I have yet to find a single way that tmux is "more capable".

The only difference is tmux has a client server model, so all sessions are
tied to a single parent process. 

That is supposed to make it more memory efficient, but I doubt the realworld
gain is in anyway significant since RAM sizes are constantly growing and
prices constantly dropping.(My current laptop has 8GB of RAM and it barely
cost me INR 22k for the whole machine.)

As someone who at any given time always has over a dozen virtual terminals
running under 4-5 different screen sessions. I don't want to put all my eggs
in one basket.

21/11/2012 for all the teaching / non-teaching staffs covering 16
departments in the college.

The college management has decided to migrate around 1500+ computers across
16 departments and all computer labs (about more than 90% of entire IT
infrastructure) from proprietary OS to GNU/Linux OS (no dualboot options)
throughout the college campus and also decided to train all staff members
to feel comfortable working on GNU/Linux platform.

Both teaching and non-teaching staffs from the following departments
attended the workshop

Department of English
Fashion Technology
Computer Science and Engineering
Computer Applications
Information Technology
Aeronautical Engineering
Mechanical Engineering (CAD/CAM)
Electrical and Electronics Engineering
Electronics and Communication Engineering

On the first day, 40+ technical staffs from the above departments were
introduced to the following with complete hands-on practice

Mageia GNU/Linux OS installation
Software management in Mageia GNU/Linux
User and Group management
Applications for regular desktop use (office / internet / VLC and Gstreamer
multimedia framework etc.)
File access / permissions (participants got familiar with commands like
setfacl for granting/restricting file access permissions to others)
Printer configuration using cups (installing HP ML-1005 MFP was really a
breeze)
Windows/Linux file sharing using samba etc.
Comparision of Proprietary applications and it's FOSS equivalent
applications

On Day 2, 60 teaching faculties from all 16 departments attended the
workshop.  All of them were introduced to Mageia GNU/Linux.  Apart from the
above topics, they were additionally introduced to few
programming/development related tools and stuffs.

A Remote Installation server was setup in the college for smooth migration
process and almost everyone enjoyed installing Mageia GNU/Linux and
applications from the server repository few times till they become
comfortable with it.

The college has planned to conduct continuous workshops and encourage all
staff members to use GNU/Linux as the primary OS platform for all academic
and research purposes.

I would like to thank BIT college management, The Director, Dr.P.Thangaraj
/ Prof and Head - CSE for the opportunity to conduct this workshop.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After conducting several FOSS workshops in the recent years, I have
realised and noticed many changes with higher education management
authorities with respect to FOSS software, and wish to share few of them
here.

1. Like BIT, in TN, many engineering colleges has lost interest in
proprietary OS / applications and also paying repeatedly for other
proprietary software licenses and have decided to move towards GNU/Linux OS
platform to maximum extent and stay with (reason due to huge software
licensing cost and increased placement opportunities for the students on
FOSS platform).

2. So far, I have received invites from 10+ engineering colleges (in
Coimbatore and surrounding region alone) to conduct workshops mainly for
the teaching / non-teaching staffs in their colleges (arts and science
colleges, polytechnics will be joining in this list soon).

3. Colleges are looking for some kind of external support in the migration
process, and they find none who fulfill their requirements.

4. They are looking alternative for almost all the existing proprietary
software apps (mainly engineering kind of software than the regular apps).
 Their wishlist is somewhat huge and will post that list in my next mail.
 We need to find some good alternatives for those software which would
enable them to try and give us some feedback.

5. In my personal opinion, ILUG-C community has done a great job in the
past several years to bring FOSS in TN education system.  Now that system
is ready for switching over to FOSS. Unfortunately, institutions who wishes
to migrate to GNU/Linux platform find difficulty in getting commercial
support from outside.  I am looking for some useful discussions on, how
this problem can be addressed and how ILUG-C can help colleges to move
towards FOSS.

Looking forward for useful discussions on the above.

While these tools are deadly poweful and useful, I have found that to use
them corporate environments, one has to go through the maze (hell?)  of
approvals and authorisations.

Many organizations have a distinct policy for usage of such probing and
evesdropping tools.

If you ever try to run them, an alert network monitoring team can be
breathing down your neck within no time.

Remember, a knife is a knife as tool. but any tool can be used both ways.

So please be _VERY_ careful and confident before you use them.

I hope I understood your requirement...
Do you want to create a deinterlaced version of a source video file?
In that case, you could use `ffmpeg` with the `-filter:v yadif` at the
input.
yadif is `yet another deinterlace filter`

More information here:
http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html
search for `yadif`

+1 Better a 2p advice than let some irresponsible member think that
these tools can be used without any legal/financial consequences.

I recall a couple of years ago, there was a discussion (in this list)
about nmap, where an over enthusiastic member was contemplating a nmap
scan on popular web sites (hopefully he did not).

Note to OP - please put in a caveat emptor that such tools are to be
used with utmost care / responsibility and at their own risk.

The request from the college was

'Users should feel comfortable when working on GNU/Linux platform, for
their day-to-day work."

The reason for choosing "Mageia":

1. On the usability front, Mageia provides the look and feel similar to
Windows 7 when used with KDE4  for the users.

2. Software management using rpmdrake is much easier for the users, when
comparing with other distros.  All teaching faculties easily configured the
software repository in their PCs and started searching/installing software
from the local server repository without requiring any assistance from
system admins /  technical assistants.

3. Once the users become familiar with Mageia, then in the later stage
there won't be any difficulty when moving to other distro's. We have
planned for implementing distros like Fedora/Debian for Development &
Research purposes.

One of the problems with BSDs is that they do not have a common upstream.

I can't quote anymore I think. Gmail has completely removed mailing list
etiquette. ;)

Anyway this article and the interview and post by Marc I read all.

Marc Espie is the author of the pkg_* tools and is a very senior OpenBSD
dev.

When you guys said BSD I thought you were talking of FreeBSD.

The article that has been linked to also is level headed and not bad.

The real issue is not having enough developers in OpenBSD but that of non
UNIX thinking invading the development of open source projects.

I agree with Marc(what is surprising here?). Long ago I installed Redhat
and was shocked to find that  there was no make in the default install.

Kingsly , i totally agree with you. I have been using screen extensively 
and tried tmux for some time. I usually have 15 or 20 windows inside 
screen and there are 3 or 4 screen sessions running for months in my 
office PC. bash-completion package and ssh and screen makes a powerful 
combination, that makes my life simpler. After giving tmux a try for 3 
months, i didnt find anything very impressive that can't be done in 
screen. My screenrc has the status bar similar to tmux or from my 
perspective better. In my screenrc, i have status bar at bottom with each 
window of ssh named after hostname i ssh. So if i login to 15 hosts in 15 
windows then there are 15 tabs in status bar each titles after the 
hostname of the machine i have ssh'ed.

with regards,
ashwin

You should've tried slackware linux instead. It still maintains the

When I meant traditional UNIX, I meant the UNIX
 culture and the way of doing things which is what
 Linux and BSDs are based on in the first place.

There was no mention of obnoxious proprietary
 implementations of UNIX anywhere in my earlier
 reply. The OP was expecting a Linux distro that is
 more similar to BSD (the traditional UNIX way of
 doing things) and Slackware Linux fits the bill.

> Respect Linux

I do, and that's why I still prefer and have been using Slackware Linux 
since 1995.

Why do you need 'make' in the default install when there are pre-built
RPM package files for everything that Redhat provides in it's distro?

There are other Linux distros like Gentoo that may have been to your liking.

management with enterprise-grade network and systems
monitoring for a fraction of the cost.

features:

* Monitoring availability of network devices using SNMP, SSH, WMI
* Monitoring of network services (HTTP, POP3, NNTP, SNMP, FTP)
* Monitoring of host resources (processor, disk usage) on most network
operating systems.
* Time-series performance monitoring of devices
* Extended Microsoft Windows monitoring via Windows Management
* Instrumentation using SAMBA and Zenoss open source extensions
* Event management tools to annotate system alerts
* Automatically discovers network resources and changes in network
configuration

        It may not be for what ever is already in the distro's
repositories. What if I write a simple C application, with the source
code over 3-4 files ? I would use make. I guess it is alright to
expect make in the default install. Thanks

To the best of my knowledge and the deployments I have seen, RHEL is
meant for server setups.  Thus, the development tools may not be part
of the "default" installations.   That is the USP Redhat has built up
for RHEL.

If I had to build something then I would do it in a "development"
machine.   To have a "development" machine, during the "install"
process, I would choose the "Development" package group and voila I
would have all the necessary tools to build my apps.   I would then
test it on a pre-production system before deploying it on the
production server.

I would not give the developer a "production" machine to develop and
test his/her code.   I think the OP needs to understand the different
philosophies of the various distros  and select the one that meets his
requirements.  In this case he probably missed the screen where he
could do package selections during install time; really it only adds a
few extra minutes to the install process.

openBSD has only one flavor and perhaps it installs every thing
including the kitchen sink to cater to *all* the needs of it's user
base and that sets up a different set of expectations when those users
move to Linux.

The same would apply to Linux folks trying *BSD.  I have a couple of
FreeBSD setups and there are differences in the way it is administered
v/s a Linux distro.  It would be comparing apples to oranges to say
the default FreeBSD install lacks blah blah vis-a-vis some Linux
distro.

       Redhat and "long back" made me think he was talking about
RH9(pre-fedora) and before and hence my reply. Otherwise, if it is a
server install with RHEL, I agree with what you say. Thanks

Can you be a bit more specific?  For instance, give an use case scenario.

I suspect you are asking from a DR perspective.

Message-ID: <CAFHFDAnzQDsiTHb=92oPdPCkY29qBWcjQ9yVorJ_pmyb63oj_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have two boxes Bodhidarmar -> server and backup (as backup_server) , I am
trying to backup the /var/log/ folder from the server on to the backup
machine.  What I found is while trying to restore the files from the backup
machine to the server rsync is changing the owner.  I am not sure why this
happens even when I use the -a switch while using rsync.

*man pages of rsync*
              rsync -*a*vz foo:src/bar /data/tmp

       This  would  recursively  transfer all files from the directory
src/bar on the machine foo into the /data/tmp/bar
       directory on the local machine. The files are transferred in
"archive" mode, which ensures that  symbolic  links,
       devices, attributes, permissions, *ownerships*, etc. are preserved
in the transfer.  Additionally, compression will
       be used to reduce the size of data portions of the transfer.

For example let us consider just auth.log

*Step1:* Here I show that auth.log has syslog and adm as owner and group.
root at Bodhidarmar:~/.ssh# ls -ltrh /var/log/auth.log
-rw-r----- 1 syslog adm 147K 2012-11-17 06:25 /var/log/auth.log

*Step2:* I am trying to backup just auth.log
backup at bala-desktop:/backup$ ls
backup at bala-desktop:/backup$ rsync -avz -e 'ssh -i
/home/backup/.ssh/backup' root at bodhidarmar:/var/log/auth.log /backup/
receiving incremental file list
auth.log

sent 30 bytes  received 9501 bytes  6354.00 bytes/sec
total size is 150330  speedup is 15.77
backup at backup:/backup$ ls -ltrh
total 148K
-rw-r----- 1 sebackup adm 147K 2012-11-16 19:55 auth.log
sebackup at backup:/backup$

*Step3:* I am deleting the auth.log on my server, so that I can restore it
from the backup which I just created.
root at Bodhidarmar:~/.ssh# rm /var/log/auth.log

*Step4: *I am restoring the auth.log
backup at backup:/backup$ rsync -avz -e 'ssh -i /home/backup/.ssh/backup'
/backup/auth.log root at bodhidarmar:/var/log/
sending incremental file list

It is not changing the owner. At the filesystem level ownership is in terms
of UID/GID etc. and not usernames.

If your users are not in sync across different machines (ie., same UID but
different usernames) Obviously the ownership will not appear correct.

In your case sebackup and aravind share the same UID on different machines.

Wonderful, however in that case when trying to get the auth.log from
Bodhidarmar in to the backup server why would rsync assign the file to
itself, Rather then syslog & adm ?

backup at backup:/backup$ grep backup /etc/passwd
backup:x:1001:1002:backup,,,,:/home/backup:/bin/bash
backup at backup:/backup$ grep syslog /etc/passwd
syslog:x:101:103::/home/syslog:/bin/false
backup at backup:/backup$

root at Bodhidarmar:~/.ssh# grep aravind /etc/passwd
aravind:x:1001:1001::/home/aravind:/bin/sh
root at Bodhidarmar:~/.ssh# grep syslog /etc/passwd
syslog:x:101:103::/home/syslog:/bin/false
root at Bodhidarmar:~/.ssh#

backup user's ssh pub keys are present in authorized_keys of root user on
the server, so I guess I need run rsync with sudo, Kindly correct me if I

I understood the problem, you are correct I had to run the initial rsync
with which I was trying to back up files with sudo so that proper ownership
is imparted to the file while getting copied in the first place.

If you are running the backup script as an unprivileged user, you can't
chown files to different users and groups you don't belong to. So all files
would be owned by the user running rsync.

The other list-member's suggestion of using sudo/running rsync as root should
fix it.

Message-ID: <CALV9oma1qL894+917vKcDr-O=FrvunOayrCYN+tvA_58tYgTXA@mail.gmail.com>

Tool of the Day: Amanda - Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver
(Server)

Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers
on a network to a single large-capacity tape drive. This package is
suitable for large amounts of data to backup. For smaller solutions
take a look at afbackup, tob, ...
Features:
* will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk,
  blasting finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as we can write files
to
  tape. For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
  with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
* built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
  later GNU Tar and others.
* does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
* supports tape changers via a generic interface. Easily customizable
  to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
  via the unix command line.
* for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
  backup image on the tape for you.
* recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
* reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
* will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
  no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
* includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks
  on both the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and
will
  send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
  fail.
* can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
  either compress or gzip.
* can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
timesharing
  computers where you want to do full dumps when the system is down in
  single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active filesystems):
  Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
* lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.
  For important notes, see /usr/share/doc/amanda-server/README.Debian.
- perl is needed for some non essential server utilities
- gnuplot is needed for plotting statistics of backups
- to backup the tape server, you need to install the client too

version: most recent stable release is version 3.3.2, released on July 25,
2012.

This tool is in OpenBSD.

$ iostat -w 4

will display all the block devices, optical media, hard disks, USB media
and the data transfer rates.

Instead of displaying for all storage devices you can choose any particular
disk also.

If you are doing a dd this can be helpful.

Also dd will understand a SIGINFO signal which kill can send using which we
can know the status, bytes transferred and speed of transfer.

top can show generic info but not this I think.

to create graphs and populates them with data in a MySQL database. The
frontend is completely PHP driven. Along with being able to maintain Graphs,
Data Sources, and Round Robin Archives in a database, cacti handles the data
gathering also. There is also SNMP support for those used to creating
traffic
graphs with MRTG.
  This package requires a functional MySQL database server on either the
installation host or remotely accessible system. If you do not already have
a
database server available, you should also install mysql-server.
The primary features of Cacti include:

 ? unlimited graph items
 ? auto-padding support for graphs
 ? graph data manipulation
 ? flexible data sources
 ? data gathering on a non-standard timespan
 ? custom data-gathering scripts
 ? built-in SNMP support
 ? graph templates
 ? data source templates
 ? host templates
 ? tree, list, and preview views of graph data
 ? user-based management and security

version: cacti 0.8.7i-2ubuntu1
size: 42.8 MB to download, 138.7 MB when installed

Subject: [Ilugc] Full system backup with rsync, ?
Message-ID: <CAFHFDAnRGNB24rK6VmNPpk_aZJSZR2RsaPm1aupyC714Xatshg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I made rsync to backup the entire / (root partition) of the server and
excluded some unwanted folders like /tmp /proc as shown below, Can I
introduce a new disk and write all the contents over so that I get a mirror
copy of the original server ?  Without formatting the new disk I cannot
copy the backed up files over to that, So I tried copying the existing
partition table using sfdisk and imported on the new media, Then I am
totally lost as to how to perform the back up.

rsync -avz --progress -e 'ssh -i /home/sebackup/.ssh/backup -l root'
server:/* /home/bala/Users/Documents/SE/backup/
--exclude={/dev/*,/proc/*,/sys/*,/tmp/*,/run/*,/mnt/*,/media/*,/lost+found,/home/*/.gvfs,/var/www/*}

Subject: [Ilugc]  ToD - tcpdump
Message-ID: <CALV9omZm7gNTcFvjfOYzR9Gm5zmjxvSnhqbr0nkvpWOiE8AcCw@mail.gmail.com>

Tool of the Day: tcpdump

   tcpdump is a common packet analyzer that runs under the command line. It
allows the user to
intercept and display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or
received over a network to
which the computer is attached. Distributed under the BSD license, tcpdump
is free software.
   Tcpdump works on most Unix-like operating systems: Linux, Solaris, BSD,
Mac OS X,HP-
UX and AIX among others. In those systems, tcpdump uses the libpcap library
to capture packets.
The port of tcpdump for Windows is called WinDump; it uses WinPcap, the
Windows port of
libpcap.
? Tcpdump analyzes network behavior, performance and applications that
generate or
  receive network traffic
? It can also be used for analyzing the network infrastructure itself by
determining whether
  all necessary routing is occurring properly, allowing the user to further
isolate the source
  of a problem.
? It is also possible to use tcpdump for the specific purpose of
intercepting and displaying
  the communications of another user or computer
? A user with the necessary privileges on a system acting as a router or
gateway through
  which unencrypted traffic such asTelnet or HTTP passes can use tcpdump to
view login
  IDs, passwords, the URLs and content of websites being viewed, or any
other unencrypted
  information.
? The user may optionally apply a Berkeley Packet filter-based filter to
limit the number of
   packets seen by tcpdump; this renders the output more usable on networks
with a high
   volume of traffic.

version: 4.3.0

Found a great blog post on this.

<quote>
web cluster powerful enough to handle 3 million requests per second.
This first article describes my limited experience with a few load
generator tools, and will hopefully save someone the time of having to
stumble through each one like I did.

Load generators are programs that generate traffic of some type for
the purpose of testing. They can show you how your server performs
under heavy loads and can give you an idea of where the server's
weaknesses may be. Learning your server's limitations through load
testing is an excellent way to gauge your server's resilience and can
help you be prepared for anything.

dd won't account for differential changes :-(  I am still investigating the

While reading on spreading gnu Linux cd, come across about freedom toaster,
a kiosk setup where users can

touch the screen
select the distro and version
get the cd burnt out.

has anyone seen that in India?
how much it Will cost to setup?
how can we build such system with low cost?

share your thoughts on this.

Yes, it was fun and informative.  It was heartening to see the
projects displayed by students from different colleges.

Yes.

For those not living in Chennai/TN, let us know how we can help.

(a) To spread the FOSS concept into the Small/Medium Enterprise space
- invite chambers of commerce to attend the conference.  Their members
will learn FOSS solutions can fit into their companies.

(b) Colleges/Institutes that have adopted FOSS into their
infrastructure/curriculum (e.g. Baskar's efforts) can show the
benefits they have reaped and encourage fence sitters to adopt FOSS.

There was a discussion on this on ubuntu-in, a few years ago, when it
was first launched. Not sure if it was setup anywhere in India though.

In LinuXpert Systems, we have more than 70+ distros including all the
recent versions (few with complete repositories) and also for multiple
architectures having more than 5+ TB of Collections.

Mr. Arun from PSG-Tech and myself had already discussed on the above,
and we assured to provide the required hardware and FOSS resources for
building a Freedom Toaster kiosk.

If anybody interested to join in this, kindly mail me offlist the list.

I have already discussed with Technical Director (a GNU/Linux user and
a FOSS enthusiast) of MSME/TDC*, Chennai  who is more interested in
introducing FOSS in SME.  We can get help from him for inviting
members from SME sector.

Why don't you invite him to our monthly meet, to give talk on
opportunities in SME for FOSS. As a person, who meet and handle SME
issues, he can share better practical ideas/suggestions.

Message-ID: <CAND2797Vd7aNvnzF5ApXE30B0Y-phG=N0OC11W+w3BoOz94how@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

I have ubuntu 12.10 and Reliance data card.
It connects to internet but in 5-10 min disconnects automatically.

/var/log/syslog has logs about the disconnection.

 <warn> CDMA connection failed: (32) Sending command failed: 'Resource

Nov 27 23:48:00 shrinivasan-laptop NetworkManager[1309]: <info>

[120 30 0]


What may be the reason?
How to make the connection persistent for longer time?

I am sure it would be an interesting project.   However, what is the
"value add" for such device today?

IMO, CD/DVDs are legacy - RIP.   There is no CD/DVD drive in the bill
of materials for systems I configure.  I have a bunch of unopened
CD/DVD spindles, I had purchased a few years ago.

Even MS is providing tools to convert the MS Windows 8 DVD install
media on to a (bootable) USB pen drive for installation.

No doubt software is still packaged / distributed in ISO format; many
are in the hybrid ISO format which facilitates installation from an
USB pen drive.

I carry the ISO files on my laptop hard drive, "dd" the relevant ISO
file to a pen drive should I need any specific distro for
installation.  It also reduces the weight of my backpack :)

My ten paise.

yes FossConf 2008 does bring me memories of Kenneth who has been
instrumental in bringing up this event for not just chennai but also
people all over India

Unfortunately as most FOSS events in India ( with exception of
Gnunify) this could run only for 2 years (2008 and 2009) . Ilugc did
get to organise some colective events like SFD but nothing on the
scale of FossConf later .

It would be a nice time to revive Ilugc's own event FossConf and my
suggestion would be to plan in advance, post regular updates of the
event in as many mailing lists as possible all over the country and
offer a regional(tamil) track where talks / discussions should be in
common language and  have simple to understand topics .

Personally this would be my chance to visit chennai & FOSS community
around there , I put forward my name to volunteer for the event as
much as possible :)

Pavithran

Cost will be depending upon
1)Touch Screen
2) HDD
3) Computer
4) CD/DVD writer
5) Beautiful box

I think Bhaskar and Arun is discussing on the same in ILUG-CBE list.

Does this happen while there is packet transfer over the connection?
or there is some idle time out setting?

It could the service provide perhaps :(

> How to make the connection persistent for longer time?

Try  "heartbeat"  ping to a friendly site on the WAN (see -i option of ping).
If this does not help then contact service provider's tech support;
from your log the problem does not appear to be on your side.

If you are using QT based application; installing Netconnect software in
GNU/Linux will create issues. Any QT based app may not work. But your
netconnect GUI will work. I tried it in Fedora 16. Finally I removed the
software to work with QT based apps.

I am facing some similar issues. Exactly at 09.58 P.M my net will be
disconnected. Even I confirmed the same with one of my Friend too.

They have not given the any GUI tool for Linux. I am using wvdial. I faced
the same issue. To keep the connection persistent, just keep pinging some
url. This might be silly idea. But it works for me. It is getting
disconnected because your device is losing connection to their tower/server
if it is idle for around 5 minutes. Try changing your DNS entry as 8.8.8.8
but I have not tried this.

Tool of the Day: puppet

    Puppet is an opensource configuration management tool. It is written
in Ruby and released under the GPL until version 2.7.0 and the Apache 2.0
license.
    Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate
elements normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and
hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services,
and files.
    Puppet's simple declarative specification language provides powerful
classing
abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while allowing
them to be as
specific as necessary, and it handles dependency and prerequisite
relationships
between objects clearly and explicitly.

version: puppet 3.0.1
size: 3.2 MB to download, 12.5 MB when installed

home page: http://www.puppetlabs.com/

Some service providers reset the connections periodically.  For
instance, in Mumbai MTNL Triband DSL service used to reset the DSL
every 6 hours or so.

Message-ID: <CAHCdRWjQsmZj3np97yABf2+ZGsgV2UYL-QZyZmsxRkBLH5xKdQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have been using ubuntu from 9.04 (of course dual-boot with XP). I have
BSNL - wired broadband (not the mobile broadband).

Now, have bought a new core i-3, HP desktop (of course pre-installed with
Win-7).  The same day I installed Ubuntu 10.04. But when restarted found it
is "not detecting the inbuilt network device at all".

After 2 -weeks yesterday re-installed Ubuntu 10.04-4, (downloaded
seperately once again), but found the same problem exists.  I could not get
into the internet at all.

there is no problem when using Win-7, it automatically goes to "auto DHCP",
whereas Ubuntu 10.04 - could not connect, always says "no network device
found"

Please suggest what could be the problem.

AFAIK,  HP creates OEM images of Windows with the hardware specific
drivers integrated into the OS.

It appears you have laptop which is "newer" than Ubuntu 10.04; it's
kernel may not have the driver for the NIC chip set. Try the latest
version and see if that fixes your problem.

Please do, so that we all know your problem was solved

Put the  word "SOLVED" some where within your message and *not* the
subject line.

It helps others who encounter similar issues and see the word in
search engine listings - indicates a closure of the problem.

IMO, no pain no gain.   Driving a high end sports car requires a
different level of skill set vis-a-vis a Maruti 800.  Need to scale up
the skill set.

Alternately take look a 'chef'

Hope you are reading the kaniyam pdf files.

We use LibreOffice Writer to generate this pdf files.

Is there any other text formatting system that supports tamil
to generate such pdf files?

I like asciidoc but it is not supporting unicode.
Latex seems a overkill.

Is there any other system?

Tool of the Day: chef

 Chef is a configuration management tool written in Ruby. It uses
a pure-Ruby, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system
configuration "recipes" or "cookbooks".

 Chef was written by Opscode and is released as open source under
the Apache License 2.0. Chef is a DevOps tool used for configuring
cloud services or to streamline the task of configuring a company's
internal servers. Chef automatically sets up and tweaks theoperating
systems and programs that run in massive data centers.

 Chef can run using a client/server model, or on a consolidated
configuration
named "chef-solo". Chef can be integrated with Cloud-based platforms such
as Rackspace and Amazon EC2. Traditionally, Chef is used to manage Linux
but later versions support running on Windows as well.

current version: 10.16.2

Subject: [Ilugc] ffmpeg transcoding
Message-ID: <CALDskyy2MtAv+6he+s6XkoahpDvQoc941E0s635=p+3Fm_Rixw@mail.gmail.com>

Anyway this mail is about how ffmpeg has evolved to bypass mencoder in
features and convenience.

Before we begin what is ffmpeg and what is mencoder?

Before that what about mplayer and vlc?

All these are multimedia applications. By multimedia we mean
 audio, video, images and text.

You can actually have a subtitle file in text format and play that
 alongside the video with mplayer.

And you can rip DVDs watch TV, take video and pictures with your webcam
using mplayer.

mencoder is its companion program for video transcoding, conversion,
effects and so on.

mplayer also has effects by which you can convert a video into B&W, reduce
the hue and saturation,
play with RGB values.

vlc is a famous video player in the Windows world which also works on UNIX.

ffmpeg is not a player. You have ffplay which can play but mplayer is far
superior.

Long ago ffmpeg was not as powerful as mencoder for background video
transcoding.

For stuff like dumping images from a video(frames), or extracting audio
from video, or
for creating video with a static image and audio background ffmpeg was not
the right tool.

But now I see that ffmpeg has adapted lot of great things from mencoder. I
can see the man page
 and figure out.

Moreover I also find it is stable and supports more options.

ffmpeg is also a great tool for screencasting. I always find a lack of
color fidelity but that is something
 we have to live with. Nothing can be done about it.

It is very easy to use and can be used for a mute video session.

This poses the real problem.
I can list down the equivalent of most general software. But, when it comes
to Engineering related apps, we need to do some research.

For instance, lets speak about Plotting of Graphs.

GNU Plot is a good plotting software which has many features. But, it is in
command line mode which most people (analysts) wont prefer.
Plot Drop is a graphical front end to GNUPLOT. But, you can't analyse the
data over there.

There are few more applications like Labplot, SciDavis, etc which are very
good to handle with versatile features.  But, I fear whether they they
could not handle much voluminous Data from a Data file or Spread sheet
(with more than 15000 data lines) .

I personally found that plotting huge data in them is not much feasible or
rather, I can't sit idle before the computer (Core2Duo Processor ; 2 GB
RAM) for more than 30 minutes.
{Which gets done within few minutes with GNU Plot or Some properitary
software!!)

I am not sure whether I am doing it in the right way. Others may also
comment on this!!

 Their wishlist is somewhat huge and will post that list in my next mail.

However, "No Pains; No Gains"

Let us get the list and try our best to find out the best alternatives!!

A small suggestion.

Sometimes it becomes difficult even for experienced users to search
which distributions provides these as binary packages in their
repositories.

So, simply do a package query in pkgs.org website and it lists the
package names alongwith the additional informations like, which
distributions provides these packages. You can paste  the link below
the Homepage.  It will be helpful for the users who may need the
binary package for their respective distribution.

I use vim to read .log files. I don't think you need a special software for
this. Any text-editor should be able to read the file.

I dunno, the file size sounded lil scary:) Don't think a  normal machine
with normal editors will be able to handle it!

grep and tail are also helpful when dealing with log files.

The article you posted is wrong. It is html quoting. We require plaintext
quoting which we can
get if we turn on plain text just above compose textarea.

Doesn't this list the contents of a directory ordered by modified time

Hey guys,

I was wondering if I could ask for some help. Victor Grigas, a

produced a fantastic video featuring wikipedia editors and about them,
where and why they edit and the impact they feel their work has.

http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Impact_Of_Wikipedia.webm

We would really like to get the subtitle translated into as many
languages as possible with one of our focuses be languages that belong
to the Indian subcontinent and we were wondering if people would be
able to help us out.

If you would like to help you can translate the messages from the
following page by selecting your language:

http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&taction=translate&language=en&group=page-Fundraising+2012%2FTranslation%2FImpact+Of+Wikipedia+Video+%28subtitles%29

Also could you relay this relay to the regional and associated
language mailing lists to spread the word? The more languages we can
get this in the better :)

Thanks for you help guys

Kumar, hostgator is not cheap. Not anywhere close. Here the discussion 
about cheap hosting providers, not just any provider. The one i am using 
gives VPS of choice of my distro for 9USD/month and hostgator offerings 
are not even close to that even for shared hosting , forget about root 
access and choosing the distro.

Hi Ashwin,

Thank you.

Please let me know your choice ? Do cheaper hosting will have relevant up
time and good bandwidth ?. If you found any hosting with more features with
lesser price is good. I am looking for the same.

The method works for both plain text and HTML.  In HTML composition
you see the vertical line bar and in plain text you see the char ">"

I concur with Guruprasad.

man watch, in Debian Wheezy, gives the following:

watch - execute a program periodically, showing output fullscreen

*periodically* is the key word above.

While your *subject line* seems to suggest that  "the" process is
running continuously and one can watch it's std out/err periodically
for instance what  top does in default mode.

In the example that you have cited, ls -ltr runs once, it's std out
displayed and that PID is gone.   The next time watch executes ls -lt
is a *new* process i.e. new PID.

I am not sure I follow this discussion but 'watch' command is awesome.

We all know that cp command doesn't give any feedback on how much of
data is copied. So to see the amount of data copied while copying around
45 GB of data, I used watch.

$watch du -s -BM 'target-file'

This monitored the file size of my target-file. Thanks for the command. =)
