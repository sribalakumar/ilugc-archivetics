Hi,

Can VLC stream 3gpp content? Darwin can do it of course but can VLC do it ?

Hi,

I have an amd 64 bit (Turion) HP laptop which has a broadcom bcm4310
wireless card. The following is the lspci output:
30:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4310 UART (rev 01)

I use Debian etch (amd64) with all the updates installed. The kernel
which I use is given below:
Linux stylesen.home 2.6.18-4-amd64 #1 SMP Mon Mar 26 11:36:53 CEST
2007 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I configured the wireless with the help of ndiswrapper with the driver
obtained from ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp33001-33500/sp33008.exe

Everything went fine and my wireless card is getting detected. I use a
Linksys wireless router WRT54G. In my office I use the same wireless
router and the same configuration. There with the help of the key it
works fine. But at the same time in home when I use the same
configuration with the wireless router with the corresponding key, am
unable to get the dhcp offers.

The following is the output of my iwlist scan:

Since output suggests that your wlan0 is waiting for dhcp offer it
seems more likely that your home router is not set to offer dhcp
leases. Look that up. It is pretty trivial to setup on that router.

It does offer dhcp, since I also have ports to connect ethernet cables
to this wireless router and from these ports I am able to get dhcp
offers. Also as I mentioned previously the other windoze clients (
there are 2 such clients) which are contacting the wireless router are
getting ip address through dhcp request. So I think the dhcp is
working fine. Is there any other possibility that I can look into?

Assign a static IP address for wlan0 on your laptop
such that it is in the wireless network, and test by
pinging the wireless router.

One way to go would be for you to use something like networkmanager (and
knetworkmanager / gnomenetworkmanager) instead of the standard wireless tools /
command line, see if it works that way ..

Are you sure you are associated to the new access point .. and try with native
drivers (broadcom and atheros both have madwifi etc that you can install and
use instead of windows drivers + ndiswrapper)

 Are you using WEP or WPA? I believe WPA requires a different configuration.
 I second Shakti's opinion. Add a static IP and then try. This will atleast tell
 you if your interface gets associated with your access point or not.

Yes I tried this, I assigned a static ip(within the routers netwrok)
to wlan0 and tried pinging the router but in vain.

When I first installed ndiswrapper, I got the wireless card as a part
of gnome network manager applet. Once I rebooted it is not showing up
in the network manager applet. But this wireless card is detected and
I am able to configure it using the
Desktop->Administration->Networking.

Yes I can try this, instead of using ndiswrapper. But one thing I am
still puzzled is the same configuration (ndiswrapper) works fine in my
office network with the same Linksys WRT54G router. Am I missing some
configuration in the wireless router end?

If hard disk cloning is what you meant,

"g4u ("ghost for unix") is a NetBSD-based bootfloppy/CD-ROM that allows easy
cloning of PC harddisks to deploy a common setup on a number of PCs using
FTP"

Maybe you need a different profile in your wireless client, or something?

Yeah true. The only change required is the change in the key. I am
trying to connect using different WEP key in office and home.

Linux file systems do not need defragmentation. This site has a nice
explanation for that:
http://geekblog.oneandoneis2.org/index.php/2006/08/17/why_doesn_t_linux_need_defragmenting

But if you have mounted some FAT/NTFS partitions and want to defragment
them, I have no idea on how to do it.

Subject: [Ilugc] Sound problem with Acer Laptop
Message-ID: <200704021354.40437.kbalavignesh@gmail.com>

Hello friends!

	I am using ACER-Aspire 1640, Open Suse 10.2. 

Sound was working well but  Yester day while working the system 
i have used hibernate. After reloading the system, sound not works for me.
Everythings looks normal.... 
My kmix have full 100% volume .... 
Alsamix have 100% volume. 
If i play songs with mplayer , it simply runs the song without sound (seconds 
for the songs are running)...

To diagnosis this problem i have done the following things,

1.) I have repeated alsaconf... but no response...
2.) I have tried to boot using ACPI=off    (from some forums )
      But, disabling ACPI stops my network.. And also while using alsaconf
	it gives the following error
	"alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device"
	(But after disabling ACPI, i can hear  the Beep sounds in console.)
	So, i think no use for disabling ACPI.
3.) Also tried with APCI off but no use..

Is there anyway to solve this problem? Pls give suggestions... I am in urge to 
solve this problem.( i have to do some audio conference).

Regards,
Balavignesh

Check this example (Observing Time Application Form):

Google for "application form tex" for more examples.

Updating the kernel for new hardware support(latest nokia phone,

Never, ever, blame the software if there is little/no

Message-ID: <ddd4b0590704030457j1be570edl12cf9875b386bc8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
        I am unable turn off  rx and tx checksum on VMware ESX 3.0 service
console (based on RHEL 3) and Arch Linux (now Ark) with ethtool.

On ESX
=======

#ethtool -K vmnic0 tx off rx off
Cannot set device rx csum settings: Function not implemented
(vmnic0 is a broadcom nic here)

On Arch Linux .8
===============

#ethtool -K eth0 tx off rx off
Cannot set device rx csum settings: Operation not supported.
(eth0 is an AMD PCnet32 nic )

Could somebody explain me why am I getting this? Would it be because the
NICs don't support it?  Any other way to achieve this?

TCP Checksum or Ethernet checksum? Anyway here is my experience:

Recently I wrote a program to read raw eth packets. In the emb boards,
I got the packet with ethernet checksum. But in desktop with same
code, I didn't get the ethernet checksums.

I really don't know, Is it specific to controller or driver ? Now just
ignoring the checksum bytes of the packet.

Bye :)

There must be a /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory with some text files.
These files have URLs where you may find some of the rpms. But, then i
guess google can find more.

Make sure your soundcard is not muted. Does sound play in Windows ?
Sometime people mute sound using the special Fn keys and it doesn't
un-mute in Linux using the same key.

As much as I would like to own one, Zaurus' are not available in
India. You'll have to get one from Japan or HongKong.

OTOH though, the standalone PDA is a dying breed now thanks to smartphones.

Or the NIC does not have the functionality? Here

Yes. Bcoz NIC know only the Ethernet protocol and don't care/know
about the upper layer protocol.

There's sometimes a lock file in /tmp/ or somewhere similar for alsa,
and that being stuck causes this issue. Restart (or stop, if necessary
killall, rmmod and modprobe the modules and then start) alsa and see if
that works?

Hibernate / suspend sometimes breaks sound, X settings etc in Acer
laptops (got a travelmate 290 myself so experienced this for myself)

my biggest gripe is how to pronounce 'linux'  - according to a  
finnish friend it is to be pronounced as leenoox - lee as in leeward  
and ooxs as in 'books'. But my tongue doesnt wrap around this.

Just add an entry to your Ubuntu in the bootloader
installed by OpenSuSE, if it was not added.

You might have to reinstall grub to the MBR. Google
for HOWTOs.

I have a Acer Aspire 3002NLC, but never had any such problems after

OP: Do you use Suspend2? Try your luck with that for hibernation and
see if the problems persist...

The following is a very good tutorial which explains how to setup a
pptp server in Ubuntu. This serves both the Windoze and *NIX clients
to connect to a private network.

something about a broken bios in Acer travelmates, setting

Take a look at the openvpn project, there is a very good chance that 
packages are already available for your distro.

Any user will expect ease of use from any software. There is nothing wrong
if a person expects software to support his new hardware. Why should he/she

Only when you clap both your hands, you can get sound.


In other words, only when the hardware vendors release
data sheets of their hardware, can software guys write
drivers/software that can drive the hardware.

True, but try and tell that to the average person when he finds his
printer is not working on Linux. A seasoned Linux user would make sure
he buys compatible hardware, but most people who make a sudden attempt
to shift to Linux would fall back to Windows only because their
existing modem doesn't work etc.

Of course, Linux is not to blame. The OP wanted a list of troubles
people face. Who is to blame, or whether software guys can do anything
is [probably] a different issue :)

Do you think a non-technical guy is bothered about whether the hardware
vendor is giving the data sheets? If his hardware is not working in linux
he is simply going to say linux does not support this hardware. Once
someone has experienced this kind of problem, it is difficult to make him
try linux again.

Well, it is our responsibility to explain to the

This question came up in most of the workshops that I
have conducted, and I have explained about the vendor
problem to the audience. Now they know. (1)

Talking about clapping with both hands - it is also the Linux OS
developer's responsibility to present a reasonably stable interface to the
driver developers which will allow the kernel developers to write drivers
which works across point releases of kernels for drivers in *both* binary
and source. That will make the job of writing drivers for Linux much
simpler.

Right now on Linux, every time the kernel changes even if it is a small
point release, the drivers will have to be recompiled. This does not make
any sense. On Windows, every time a service pack is applied or a hotfix is
applied, the users don't have to either recompile their entire set of
drivers or download binaries of the drivers for *that specific* kernel
point release.

If a driver is loaded on a computer with a 2.6 linux kernel, it should
work across all 2.6.x releases of the kernel without requiring a
recompile. But that is not the case right now.

Right now, Linux users have to wait for a long time after a latest
hardware comes out. They will have to hope that the company will either
release the complete hardware specs, and there is atleast one talented
kernel developer who has a personal interest in the hardware and is
willing to maintain the driver for a long time.

In my humble opinion, this is the wrong way of doing things. It should be
the hardware vendor's responsibility to write the drivers - they have the
greatest to gain from it. However, these companies may not be willing to
release the full specification of their device because they want to
protect their competitive edge for a while longer.

However since Linux OS developers have decided not to fix an interface for
the drivers, these companies will have to either a) release the driver as
source for the linux user to compile and load or b) release a binary
driver for each point release of the kernel. Nvidia has gotten around this
problem by creating their own kernel interface layer for the driver which
must be recompiled every time the kernel is changed. This allows their
binary-only drivers to be used on Linux machines without requiring
recompiles.

But that is strange - why would a company have to write its own kernel
interface layer? shouldn't this be part of the linux kernel? If it were a
part of the kernel, I am sure Linux hardware compatibility would be far
better than it is now.

Because Linux drivers are so closely tied up with the kernel, each version
(or point release) of the kernel source includes the source for many of
these drivers as well. So the binary of the linux kernel which ships as
default with many distributions of Linux will include a whole bunch of
drivers (including for some esoteric hardware) which the user does not
require at all.

Linux users are expected to recompile their kernel for their computers by
specifically turning off/on drivers which they don't want. These drivers
can be marked as compiled into the kernel or loadable as external modules
prior to recompilation.

Again, this would have been unnecessary if there was a clean interface
between the drivers and the rest of the kernel. It should be possible to
download the basic kernel (without the drivers) and then the drivers
separately or update the kernel without updating the drivers or update the
drivers (binaries) without changing the kernel.

That is not to mean that there won't be periodic changes to the driver
interface which will require companies to release drivers which work
against this new interface, but these changes shouldn't happen very often.

I am sure most users would be annoyed with Microsoft if every  update to
the kernel required the user to download and install a new set of drivers.
But for some reason we think it is ok if it worked that way on Linux.

Thoughts?

Firstly, I think your email is based on many assumptions - a few that 
are not correct at all.

Then here is a question for you : When was the last time you did a 
kernel upgrade on Windows ?  afaik, XP had 1 kernel update, and that too 
was a patch into filesystem code to fix a security issue.

> Right now on Linux, every time the kernel changes even if it is a small

This is absolutely not true. eg,. I've had a stable driver on my home 
server for the 3ware 9550sx working fine for almost 2 years now ( the 
machine has gone through, I've just checked, 11 kernels in the mean time 
). My laptop has been running ati prop drivers ( yea, i know :> ), since 
Nov 2005 and I've only had to rebuild them earlier this year, since I 
choose to rebase to a newer version of these drivers.

well, thats a bit harsh - are you saying that no development work should 
happen on a kernel once its released ? Also, you seem to be confused 
about what constitutes the 2.x.x release factors.

> Right now, Linux users have to wait for a long time after a latest
> hardware comes out. 

why ? My Jmicron based kit was working on Linux before it worked on 
Windows...

OK, i know thats an exceptional case, but they do exist - but the time 
it takes from release -> usability is decreasing drastically. Specially 
a the userbase grows and more people become "visible" as users, hardware 
manufacturers will support more stuff ( classic case is the Xen people 
working with AMD when pacifia was evolving, and support was rolled in 
before the hardware even went into major production )

politics and the blame games of 'your responsibility' and 'my 
responsibility' are usually shunned in the open source world. Hey, you 
think I am going to hang around waiting for someone to write a driver 
that I might want right now ? if I have the time, just do it myself and 
push it back upstream.

Thats again assumption and gross mass generalisations.

there is dkms, which is open source, and if you really really do use a 
unstable distro and need that sort of functionality, feel free to use 
dkms, or one of the dozen odd kernel module management tools that are 
already out there.

you seem to be pointing fingers at these 'linux developers' but you seem 
to forget there is no single entity that is the linux-developers, 
contributions come in many and varied forms.

hey, you mean kind of like every distro also includes a lot of other 
packages that most people dont use ? You just distroyed the one thing 
that the debian guys are so proud of :)

thats a very wrong assumptions - most linux users are _not_ expected to 
recompile anything at all. Where did you get this misconception from ? 
eg. One place I do some work at, has about 500 machines running linux. 
Can you imagine everyone rebuilding their kernel and kernel modules 
eveyr so often ( and why? just for the sake of it ? ).

Linux isnt Windows, what you get with Linux comes with a few 'issues' 
but there are workarounds to most such issues.

Also, I dont see why people seem to moan and groan about driver support 
in Linux anymore. eg. OSX supports a very small subset of devices that 
Linux does - how many times do you see people on OSX complain about such 
things ? Finally, I remember a couple of years back sitting through this 
tech meet at a MS-Vendor, and what came across was that 90% of all 
crashes and reliability-of-platform issues were in the drivers and 
driver handling code. hey, dont know about you - but I like to not 
reboot my servers ( or even my workstations ) every day :)

RMS said in his interview:::: "Ask your hardware vendor to give Open sources
driver for the hardware.if he is not providing any open driver"DONT BUY THAT
HARDWARE"..

I dont have any doubt that open drivers are far far far better that closed
drivers.

Simple users like myself often don't know the ABCs of writing Device 
drivers. We expect them to be shipped on CDs or to work off the box.

OSX is meant to run on a mac and a mac _only_. The amount of hardware 
that they need to support is limited to what they ship on their mac. 
Apple would not provide support, if you were to install a modded version 
of OSX on your PC.

Tried the same on broadcom 5703 which has tcp checksum suppport.

Result

* Works on Linux

* Does not work on VMware ESX.

Looks like it's lack of support in VMware driver for the NIC.

you see therein lies the confusion - in an open source world, there are 
no real users and providers. Some of the recent commercial stuff does, 
however, feed this confusion much though :(

Everyone can contribute in some way or the other, and the circle / 
process works for everyone as long as there are enough people doing 
enough for the important bits, and there are some people still working 
on the fringe/related issues.

Having said that - I totally take on board the fact that there is much 
hardware out there that does not work well with linux at the moment - 
but the rate of adoption is changing ( increasing ) and hopefully this 
will get on top of stuff. Eg. its easy to see how the user density on 
server and enterprise linux users has already had a massive effect on 
hardware vendors who compete in these markets. And, on the Desktop sides 
as well there is major movement, but I suppose it takes longer there 
since h/w diversity is much greater there in a very competitive environment.

Exactly, and therein is the issue : OSX users are only using a very 
small subset of h/w that is available out there ( and hey, its all 
mostly PC compatible now :D ) - so if you are looking at a solution, 
talk to a provider who certifies and provides hardware that works on 
Linux - its *one* option.

Having said that, I already know how hard that can be in the 
always-moving markets of suppliers in India :(

Hi,

To avoid cluttering my Panel, I am trying to move the some of the 
applications to another Desktop.  When I do so, the application is shown 
on the desktop I had sent to (icon comes), but still all the 
applications are on the Panel.    Even when I switch to a new desktop, 
all the applications that are open are visible and not the applications 
on that desktop alone.

When I was using Red Hat earlier, only those applications that are 
running on a specific desktop are visible on the panel.  I am currently 
running Kubuntu (6.06) on my PC.  Am I missing any option that need to 
be specified or is this a bug or Kubuntu does not support the feature?

You may have installed Flash player, but probably not the plugin. Get
the .tar.gz from

http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash

and install it using the script. Or, manually move the
libflashplayer.so to the ~/.mozilla/plugins/. That will install the
plugin.

A request, do NOT reuse threads. That is, create a new mail to
ilugc@... instead of replying to an existing mail.

As for your problem, I am guessing that you are using KDE. To view
only the current desktop's applications on the taskbar,	go to the
Control Center, select Desktop->Taskbar, and ensure that "Show windows
from all desktops" is unchecked.

Oops, so there are  kernel updates for windows??? Whenever I installed
any of those hot fixes for windows, i ve had to reinstall windows
jeopardizing every thing else. The only kind of update i ever do on
windows is virus scan db!

> This is absolutely not true.
Maybe I don't agree. Some times, the drivers expect specific things
from the kernel or just are too coupled to it. Again, I presently
don't have concrete examples on hand, but I ve installed new kernels
and reverted because I didn't want to compile the drivers. There are
cases where I just copied the ko file from the previous kernel and it
worked. But, I am not sure that happens every time.

Some times, the "if" is a very big question and can have people use
the second boot until something stabilizes

But I thought the topic was about non-developer linux users! I don't
expect them (in fact even a developer me) to contribute to the kernel!

There have been multiple upgrades to the Windows XP kernel and the
subsystems. Service Pack 1, and Pack 2 were major upgrades, besides these
there have been many, many more.

Please see the following URL for a list.
http://support.microsoft.com/

The reason you didn't notice that these were kernel upgrades proves my
point that the MS update mechanism for kernels works well. If the kernel
upgrade had required you to recompile your drivers every single time, you
would have noticed it by now.

You can install compile drivers provided with *source* into the kernel if
you have the kernel headers without recompiling the entire kernel. But if
you don't have the source for the driver, you are out of luck.

Even Nvidia (and I think ATI too) ship binary drivers with multiple
precompiled kernel interface layer code - one for each point release of
the kernel. When a new kernel is released and if you don't have a
precompiled header for it, you must compile the kernel interface layer
code provided.

My point: If binary drivers can be supported by requiring companies to
provide their own kernel interface layers, won't it be simpler to just
provide the kernel interface layer as part of the kernel itself?

I am not a kernel developer. So if there are kernel developers here,
please enlighten if I have anything mixed up or if I am wrong.

Did I say that or are you assuming that I did?

What I am saying is that the driver interface should be fixed, not the
kernel. It is possible to write a driver for Windows which will work
across service packs, kernel updates etc. Major changes to the kernel can
be made without changing the driver interface. On occassion when the
driver interface has to be changed, it should be. But it is unlikely that
each point release of the kernel requires such a change. The kernel
developers can try and keep the driver interface as stable as possible so
that even binary drivers can be used across kernel updates.

Hardware manufacturers have an interest in selling their products and so
they will try and have drivers available for as many mainstream OSs as
possible. Is that a difficult to understand concept? The reason they can't
do that very effectively on Linux is because they have to provide the
source.

>Thats again assumption and gross mass generalisations.

If I am making an assumption, specify it. The same applies for
generalizations.

Some questions for you:

a) Why don't you get the source drivers for ATI?
b) If that is not available, how is that you have not gotten around to
writing the drivers for your ATI card yet?
c) Oh, you mean ATI hasn't released the specs for it? Why not? (hint: see
my "assumption" above")

Your answers will explain my point.

>you seem to be pointing fingers at these 'linux developers' but you seem

>contributions come in many and varied forms.

Linux is not some amorphous entity which comes about (evolves) all by
itself without anyone making the decisions concerning its architecture.
Decisions about something like a fixed driver layer has been discussed
multiple times on the linux kernel developer lists, but for some reason it
has been decided not to stabilize on a driver interface because the linux
developers want the freedom to modify the interface anytime they want.

I can understand that they want this freedom to be able to make changes to
the interface, but they must contend with the fact that they are making
things much more inconvenient to users and to hardware vendors.

And yes, such as thing as a "user" does exist. Not everyone is going to
sit down and write a driver or make changes to the linux kernel. How often
have you done this yourself and this despite the fact that you perhaps
fall in the < 0.01  odd percentage of people out there perhaps with the
skills and the interest?

>Also, I dont see why people seem to moan and groan about driver support
>in Linux anymore. eg. OSX supports a very small subset of devices that
>Linux does - how many times do you see people on OSX complain about such
>things ?

This is an oft-quoted answer to a question about the driver interface so I
will address this.

1) It is a myth that Linux has more drivers than any other OS. What is
true is that Linux kernel *SHIPS* with more drivers than that comes with
any other OS. That is to say that the Windows installation CDs won't have
the same number of drivers as Linux.

But the point is that Windows does not *NEED* to ship with all these
drivers because the windows driver architecture allows hardware vendors to
ship binary drivers with their hardware on driver CDs.

2. OSX - OSX like windows also does not *NEED* to ship with all the
drivers. Also, OSX is shipped by Apple on the hardware they produce
themselves so they have greater control of what hardware to support.

Please note that I fully accept that I may be wrong about the benefit of
having a stable driver API. But if I am, I would like to hear the specific
reasons. Linux fanboy statements don't count as specific reasons.

Thanks for you patience,
PK

Not to be nit-picky. But I believe, a copy into the directory is 
supposed to cause some instability. A wise old man advised me to symlink 
the .so file into the ~/.mozilla/plugins/ directory.

Your experience is not typical. There have been cases where windows
service packs have caused problems, but it is not very common.

We use windows in our company and we have multiple computers with Windows
XP installed and we keep it updated regularly. We are yet to experience
any of what you seem to have encountered.

I do not know if I want to appreciate your reply. I added my

perfectly well with periodic online updates!

Once you do this, open a browser and enter "about:plugins" in the
address bar and see if the Flash Plugin is listed there. If "stuff"
still doesn't load, we have a problem.

You didn't use any search engine? 

Debian on an emulated ARM machine:
http://www.aurel32.net/info/debian_arm_qemu.php

Running GNU/Linux for ARM processors under QEMU
http://nepotismia.com/linux/qemu/arm/

Google for "qemu for arm" for more examples.

To cross-compile your own kernel set the following in
the kernel Makefile:

ARCH=arm
CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/arm-linux-gcc

In future, please use a search engine for answers
before posting a question.

Dear all

   Kenneth,I and Parthan conducted a two day workshop on FOSS to the
1 and 2 year student of MCA in VLB Janakiammal Engg College 
Coimbatore on 4 and 5th Apr 2007.

Kenneth inagurated the session with a talk on contributing to FOSS. 
We covered intro,installation basic gui-cli, visual programming,
networking, scripting langugage and ltsp. 

   The students were enthusiastic, the faculty and management very
supportive. I am sure to see growing use of FOSS in this college and
hope many of forthcoming final year projects will be in FOSS.

   On behalf of ILUGC I thank the management,Prof Thilagu HOD and
other faculty members for giving us an opportunity. I also thank
NRCFOSS for arranging this.


Raman.P

Dear all,

   On 6th Apr 2007, I and Parthan visited Kongu Engg College,
Perunthurai,Erode at the invitation of CS and IT HOD's. I gave two
talks - one on LTSP and other on Linux High Availability using
heartbeat and drbd - to the Kongu Linux Users Group (KLUG).

    I am impressed by the work done the group. They meet once a week
and make presentations. Many of the active members are first and
second year student an commendable effort. This group gets very good
support from the faculty and management also.

    We suggested them to open up their activities to colleges near
them also. 

    I thank the mangement, faculty and students of the group for
giving us an opportunity.

     I am sure this group will do more work in future. 

Raman.P

which OS are u using? normally when a plugin isn't available, firefox does
show them on the top of the browser instructing to install the missing
plugin. a button "Install Missing Plugin" should also be generally
displayed. clicking on it will search for the plugin (in this case its
flash) and it will be installed most of the cases. re-starting firefox
should make the plugin installed, functional.

If your OS is Ubuntu +, then from the terminal install the flash plugin in
Multiverse repository,

$ sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree

this should help on re-starting the browser...

I just need 1 line at least for now to test things. I don't really know I
can use a regular modem. How should I configure this, just like any FXO

Message-ID: <9a9bfc170704071002o1caf5b77g19bf54ccb3648473@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

When a package is upgraded and a configuration file changes as a
result, dpkg usually asks the user whether the new conf file should be
installed if it has local changes. Is it possible to make it ask this
question even when dpkg is just reinstalling the same version? I know
its possible to unpack the .deb file and replace/diff manually but
would like to know if this is possible...

it moves on...

IMO the new name is more appropriate and professional than GAIM.
After all GAIM is not just GTK+ AOL Instant Messenger anymore.

Subject: Etch in the hands of the Stable Release Managers
To: debian-devel-announce@lists.debian.org


Hi,

You might read about now in debian-announce [1] that we have just
released. Please don't upload all your new software instantly, but
wait a few days until the archive is set up properly for Lenny.

At this point, we would like to thank all people who have helped to
release Debian 4.0 (Etch). Only through the work of the community we
were able to get to this point.

It's hard to write "thank you"s for a project as big as etch because there
are *so many* people involved in pulling this off, but they deserve
recognition for etch as much as we do -- people like the ftp team, the
installer team, the CD team, the mirror team, the porters, the release notes
editors, the translators, and an amazing group of "release minions" who
just worked wherever it was necessary like Steinar Gunderson, all of whose
contributions were essential for getting us to this point.

Special thanks to all those who have worked through the weekend for those
finishing touches that brought the release together, including Ryan, Anthony,
Frans, Steve McIntyre, Frank Lichtenheld, Mattias Wadenstein, Alexander Schmehl,
and many others.

And of course, thanks to the Debian Project as a whole, including
the innumerable mass of people who have provided patches, reported
bugs against testing or contributed in some other way.  This is your release,
friends.

We also want to apologize to the translations teams and thank them for
their work on the localisation of the release notes, our provided
deadlines were quite tough. Thanks for handling this so well.


Preparing the first point-release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are already some packages known that will need an update in stable
soon.  Best known is the kernel, which has some annoying bugs with pending
fixes. If you are aware of any important bug that is waiting
in unstable and didn't make the release because of time constraints,
send a mail to debian-release@lists.debian.org.  The usual rules that
were in place for freeze exceptions are also mainly valid for the first point
release of the Etch life cycle. It will be possible to accept packages
directly from unstable to stable-proposed-updates. If you want the stable
release team to do that, wait with new uploads until you got a confirmation
that the package was accepted.

Also we might accept bug fixes to meet our release goal of LSB 3.1 compliance.


Continuing with Lenny
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After the release is before the release. We don't have too specific plans
for the Lenny release cycle yet, but there are a couple of things that
are already known:

 * Lenny should be kept in a releaseable state most of the time (with the
   exception of breakages caused by one of the big transitions; but we
   should try to keep even these as small as possible).  This
   means that there are no excuses for not fixing an RC bug.  The problems
   that were uncovered by piuparts runs in the past two weeks have been
   mostly ignored for Etch, but they need to be fixed for Lenny.  These
   are trivial fixes, please apply them and upload soon.

 * Please coordinate your uploads a bit, so that the testing transition
   of packages stays possible.  Everybody uploading new software
   usually makes britney cry and hinders the transition of new versions.

 * We will work with release blockers and release goals again for the
   Lenny release cycle.  If you have anything that you feel belongs in
   one of these two categories, send a mail to -release, so that we can
   include it in our plans.  However, we want you to remember that
   -release is not a discussion list.

 * We want to restrict the release cycle for Lenny to less than 2 years,
   we want to discuss experiences of Etch first though to get a more
   accurate time planning.


We'll soon send a more in-detail information about what we think we learned
from Etch, and a few more things for Lenny. We'll also try to have an
Lenny-kick-off-meeting soon - we'll announce that in time as well, so that
anybody can feed us with ideas.


Now, we'll party and let the SRMs do the rest until Etch is out.  Thanks
again to all of you for the great support Debian got.


Yours Debian Release Team

  It can't be done - PCI-e is a different bus standard
from PCI-X. In any event, it's trivial to swap out the
old motherboard and replace it with a new one
with PCI-e support, faster processor, more RAM, etc.

Any specific reason for starting with this topic "Contributing to
FOSS". Could you tell us more about this? In user perspective, I doubt
if it would be productive to tell them the importance and benefits of
contributing to FOSS when they are still unaware or new to FOSS.

Generally in our introductory talks, what we mainly cover is 
philosophical aspects of FOSS and try to make them understand the 
advantages. The talk "contribution to FOSS" was aimed at implying that 
what we call as FOSS is more about Contribution and Collaboration. It 
explained how things work and how things are done in what we call as FOSS.

The talk was small, simple and covered practical details of 
"Introduction to FOSS". I request Kenneth to make the presentation 
available so all those who did not attend your talk can get to know what 
you spoke about.

Check the files in the /lib/kbd folder. Looks like a file
corruption. OR change the font/keytable and try.

$1 value is valid?

The article doesn't say so, does it? Anyway, bugs will be there, but
most people won't be affected, provided they read the release
notes. And, the release notes itself says the kernel will need some
cleaning up and it will be done pretty soon.

I check the folder /lib/kdb i could see the unicode font there

Subject: [Ilugc] Tamil keyboard layout(s)?
Message-ID: <20070409224800.A27085@Snorkel.rtfm.net.au>

A simple question for the list. Maybe.

What is the most well-known or appropriate Tamil keyboard layout to configure
on a bilingual system? I have the "Tamil Unicode" keyboard working on Ubuntu,
and am told this resembles typing in MSWord with a Tamil font selected; but
hunting around on the web I can't find a graphical representation of this
layout; instead I'm finding Inscript, Remington, Tamil99 and who knows what
else. All I want is a single layout to standardise on, which will be worth the
time spent to learn/teach on it. If USB keyboards with the appropriate Tamil
and English glyphs printed on their keycaps are available, so much the better!

If you could identify the appropriate lyout for me by name, with an image, and
by how to enable it in SCIM (I take it that's the easiest way to get both
Ubuntu desktop and OpenOffice working uniformly) I'd be muchly appreciative.

Cheers,

Doran

By default, selecting the "Tamil Unicode" gives me the
option of entering text in Gnome. I use only Chinese
with SCIM. 

Under Keyboard Preferences -> Layout Options ->

If u need the physical presence of Tamil letters in the keyboard then Tamil
99 is recommended.
TVS has released a keyboard  (TVS Champ) based on Tamil 99 Layout. It costed
Rs 450 some five months back.

Layout of this keyboard can be had from the following URL,

http://ubuntu-tam.org/tamil_ubuntu_wiki/index.php/?????_99_??????_????

The picture of TVS keyboard is also given....

incidently the sole criterion as to whether a thing is foss or not is  
whether the code is shared or not. You will note that the 4 freedoms  
do not mention tools or platform. Just how the code is to be share.  
It is important for people to understand this from the start -  
especially in India where sharing of code is very low priority

50K a year in Boston isn't really a "wow" job, salary wise, trust me.

the wow wasnt really about the salary. It is more the difference  
between the level of organisation and professionalism of not-for- 
profits in the west compared to what we have here. I was looking at  
the organisational tree of creative commons the other day - looks  
like a medium sized corporate. In fact even a large corporate in  
India may not have such a galaxy of talent.

  Well... it isn't :(

> What is the most well-known or appropriate Tamil keyboard layout to configure

  Most well-known : (among Tamil population) Remington layout (aka Old
Typewriter layout).
    This layout is the equivalent of qwert for English
    (inefficient & non-intutive but most widely used)

  Most appropriate : depends ...
       (for people familiar with English keyboard):
             Phonetic (on scim)
       (keyboards with the appropriate Tamil and English glyphs printed):
             Tamil99 (on scim?)

What you have as "Tamil Unicode" (uses xkb) maps
closer to what one might call as New Typewriter layout.

Now some *history* of Tamil Keyboard layouts:

* Remington layout (Old Typewriter layout)
  The initial Tamil typewriter layout was
  designed by Ramalingam Muttiah. (circa 1915)
  (see http://www.tamilnation.org/hundredtamils/muttiah.htm)
  This is has been the standard for typewriter.
  Most widely used layout.
  Typwriting institutes still use the mechanical typewriter
  (and hence this layout).

* New Typewriter layout:
  Changes were made to Remington layout to make it a bit intutive
  (probably during the advent of Electronic typewriters?).
  Except for a few geeks and my wife,
  I have'nt quite seen anyone else use this :)

* Inscript layout:
  Proposed by CDAC.
  Many systems using CDAC's *Gist* use this.
  I know of atleast one organization that use this extensively.

* Tamil99 layout:
  Proposed by Govt. of Tamil Nadu in 1999.
  For this layout, you can get "keyboards with the appropriate Tamil
  and English glyphs printed on their keycaps" at Chennai's Richie street.

* Phonetic layout:
  first created by Murasu. Meant for people familiar with English keyboard.

   When talking of Tamil keyboard layouts, the ideas is to get a Tamil character
   when one presses a key or a combination of keys.

Microsoft is frequently dinged for having insecure products, with
security holes and vulnerabilities. But Symantec (Quote), no friend of
Microsoft, said in its latest research report that when it comes to
widely-used operating systems, Microsoft is doing better overall than
its leading commercial competitors.

The information was a part of Symantec's 11th Internet Security Threat
Report. The report, released this week, covered a huge range of
security and vulnerability issues over the last six months of 2006,
including operating systems.

The report found that Microsoft (Quote) Windows had the fewest number
of patches and the shortest average patch development time of the five
operating systems it monitored in the last six months of 2006.

During this period, 39 vulnerabilities, 12 of which were ranked high
priority or severe, were found in Microsoft Windows and the company
took an average of 21 days to fix them. It's an increase of the 22
vulnerabilities and 13-day turnaround time for the first half of 2006
but still bested the competition handily.

Red Hat Linux was the next-best performer, requiring an average of 58
days to address a total of 208 vulnerabilities. However, this was a
significant increase in both problems and fix time over the first half
of 2006, when there were 42 vulnerabilities in Red Hat and the average
turnaround was 13 days.

The one bright spot in all of this is that of the 208 Red Hat
vulnerabilities, the most of the top five operating systems, only two
were considered high severity, 130 were medium severity, and 76 were
considered low.

Then there's Mac OS X. Despite the latest TV ads ridiculing the
security in Vista with a Matrix-like Agent playing the UAC in Vista,
Apple (Quote) has nothing to brag about. Symantec found 43
vulnerabilities in Mac OS X and a 66 day turnaround on fixes.
Fortunately, only one was high priority.

Like the others, this is also an increase over the first half of the
year. For the first half of 2006, 21 vulnerabilities were found in Mac
OS X and Apple took on average 37 days to fix them.

Bringing up the rear were HP-UX from Hewlett Packard (Quote) and
Solaris from Sun (Quote). HP-UX had 98 vulnerabilities in the second
half of 06 and took 101 days to fix them. Sun, though, really dragged
its feet, taking on average 122 days to fix 63 vulnerabilities. It
wasn't doing much better in the first half of 06, either. It took 89
days to fix 16 vulnerabilities.

Alfred Huger, vice president of engineering for Symantec Security
Center, said the real problem is with Web applications, where
two-thirds of all vulnerabilities are found. Operating systems are
fairly minor, and despite the long time periods, the vendors are doing
"an ok job, just not stellar."

The response from vendor's mentioned in the report was mixed. A
Microsoft spokesperson issued a statement to internetnews.com that
said in part "As a part of this industry, Microsoft continues to adapt
to address these threats and continues to work with others in the
industry to protect customers as a whole."

Anuj Nayar, manager of Apple's Mac OS X and developer relations, would
only say "Apple takes security very seriously and has a great track
record of addressing vulnerabilities before they affect you."

Sun specifically disputed Symantec's data and conclusions in a
statement emailed to internetnews.com:

"Symantec's data on security vulnerabilities simply does not match
Sun's. We can't verify Symantec's sources and consider their report on
Sun inaccurate. From 7/1/06-12/31/06 we published 54 Security Sun
Alerts, of which 36 were for Solaris - substantially less the 63
Solaris vulnerabilities claimed in the Symantec report. Past analysis
of our vulnerability response shows we responded within five days for
the vast majority of vulnerabilities, but averages are skewed by a
small minority of 3rd party applications (or code) that are
included/bundled with Solaris. Sun responds to all reports of security
vulnerabilities, and we stand by our reputation and established track
record of responding to security vulnerabilities with Sun Alerts and a
quick turnaround time for patches.

Analyst Charles King with Pund-IT said Microsoft has had to be
aggressive about dealing with security issues because it's such a big
target. In that regard, the company has met the challenge.

"I think in a way that a culture of having been under attack for a
decade or more has led to the company taking a very proactive approach
to fixing those problems," he told internetnews.com. "In the last 24
months, they've taken a very aggressive stance toward the security of
their system. In review after review of Vista, despite its faults, the
security of the system has been considerably better than XP."

Two questins to be asked:
1) What were these vulnerabilities? How severe and how easy to activate?
2) Is the average a good indication of how much time it took?

If a high-priority issue took several weeks while a low-priority one took only 
days, or vice versa, how does this affect the study?

12 severe vulnerabilities vs only two for RedHat and one for OS X. That's 
something to measure also.

Without knowing more details of this study, I don't think it's prudent to come 
to any particular conclusions.

Subject: [Ilugc] [JOB] Systems and Network Admin
Message-ID: <461C41B5.60609@karan.org>

Hi,

We ( DSource Plc )  are looking to hire 3 ( three ) sysadmins in India.
I am going to try and cover the details, briefly - feel free to send
questions my way; either onlist or offlist. Also, if you know someone
who might be interested,feel free to forward this email to them.

Job Spec:

While the job is primarily system admin and network management, there is
a fair bit of 'script coding' that is also required.

Required:

The Indian operation is just starting off, so initial work will require
a fair bit of remote 'pairing'. We are also going to be spending a few
months in India onsite at a client, so expect to be thrown right into
the firezone.

Technologies that should not be strange to you : Linux ( we are a 100%
CentOS / RHEL shop ), Xen, selinux, puppet ( and/or cfengine ), isp
grade networks ( routing, packet monitoring and performance testing ),
high performance database's, high density storage, large data volume
handling.

You *must* be able to write scripted code in ruby. Python and php are
also handy to know - but not required - since lots of our legacy stuff
is done in python and php ( dont ask, the php stuff was before my time
... ). We dont really care about what degree you have. we also dont care
if you got 60% or 90% in your exams or what certificates you carry along
with you. But, you need to be able to communicate in English, must have
atleast a few years of working in a related environment. Common sense
and an ability to rationally think are, however, critical! General
sysadmin skills are essential ( we will test you on these ). People with
a well thumbed copy of 'unix power tools' should definitely apply!

All assignments are permanent, full time and come with the govt
requirements for benefits etc.

Location:

We are looking for people based in Pune, Delhi and Chennai as a base.
However, for people based in Delhi and Chennai there will be a frequent
( not exceeding 4 working days / month ) requirement to travel to Pune.

Type of Employer:

The Company is a infrastructure management consulting service, where we
offer systems and network services to clients. We have 27 people working
full time and 8 people part-time in the UK. And a further 6 people in
Australia. Agile and XP practises are a cornerstone of the management
style ( in that there is really no management, the entire organisation
tree is very flat ).

Salary and Benefits:

You get paid pretax's Rs.80,000/- a month. We expect you to work 38 hrs
per week. We also only work half-days on Wednesdays. There maybe a
requirement to work weekends, but only after suitable advance notice (
mostly to handle infrastructure outage that cant happen during the work
week ). There is a 6 months trial run period, wherein you get to see
what we do and if you want to work with us, and we get to see if we want
you working with us.

Interview process:

1. Send me a CV.
2. We call you for a quick chat on the phone. ( 20 min ).
3. Have a longer  ( 3 hrs estimate ) sysadmin 'pair' session.
4. Fix a time and have a longer ( 1 hr ) developer 'pair' session.
5. People get hired. ( 1st week of June 2007 )

Configure and build busybox to create the necessary
executables and shell that you want. For example, it
will create bin/, sbin/, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin
directories.

You can then add the other directories like /var, /etc
as per your need.

This is the method to build a customized filesystem
image for use in embedded systems.

Do you want to build file system like ext2 or a directory structure,
collection of commands/tools/files, on top the file system?

My talk will usually start my talk by asking 
Do all of you understand Tamil?

Can I talk in Tamil and English?

During all our seminar we encourage people to ask question in Tamil
also.

I too follow the same style. Sometime, I may ignore the 1 or 2% of
non-native audiences, for the benefit of others. The reason is, when
we speak in the local language, it will go into their mind with-out
much effort.

Hi list
Can any one *donate* me some web space and a domain name? The bytes
could be anything more than 20 Megs.

I currently host my homepage at http://amitsaha.in.googlepages.com
and want to move it to something like a .org or a .in

If not free, please point out some really cheap , very cheap web space
providers.

I am afraid I might get a kick on my back because of this mail.

nrc-foss can give web space for students as long as they code the  
website themselves, the code is available online and the content is  
related to free/opensource software. Domain name '.org.in' is  
available for 400 bucks a year

Mmm can I second that request: in particular, if there's any chance that
someone could burn a mirror of Edubuntu Edgy/main I'd be eternally grateful.
Universe would be nice but that might be a little much to ask :-).

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0704111811470.13112-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

LJ TECH TIP:

This tech tip comes from the book Beginning Ubuntu Linux by Keir
Thomas (Apress):

After using Ubuntu for some time, you might find that the disk begins
to get full.  You can keep an eye on disk usage by using the following
command in a GNOME Terminal window:

   df -h

This will show the free space in terms of megabytes or gigabytes, and
also expressed as a percentage figure. If the disk does start to get
full, you can take some steps to make space more available.

* Emptying the /tmp Folder

An easy way to regain disk space is to empty the /tmp folder.  As with
the Windows operating system, this is the folder in which temporary
data is stored.  Some applications clean up after themselves, but
others don't, leaving behind many megabytes of detritus.

Because the /tmp folder is accessed practically every second the
system is up and running, to empty it safely, it's necessary to switch
to run level 1.  This insures few other programs are running and
avoids the risk of deleting data that's in use.  The following series
of commands will switch to run level 1, empty the /tmp folder, and
then reboot afterwards:

      sudo killall gdm
      [login with your username and password]
      sudo init 1
      rm -rf /tmp/*
      reboot

Tip: On a similar theme, don't forget to empty the desktop
Wastebasket. This can hold many megabytes of old data.

* Emptying the Cache of Package Files

You might also choose to clear out the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT)
cache of old .deb package files.  On a system that has been very
frequently updated, this can free many megabytes (possibly gigabytes)
of space.

You can empty the cache by typing the following command in a GNOME
Terminal window:

     sudo rm -f /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb

Caution! Be careful to type the command to empty the APT cache exactly
as it is written.  Even inserting an additional space can lead to very
bad consequences.

If you want to restore any packages later on, simply locate them in
the Synaptic Package Manager list, click the check box, and click Mark
for Reinstallation.  This will cause the package to be downloaded,
installed and configured.

HTH :)

Looks like they are shipping only to the contributors. In other words,
they need an account in launchpad, Ubuntu project management software.
It's sensible!

I assume that you can write script-fu with GIMP to
automate adding text to images.

Check their documentation.

I think not. I guess they allowed everyone to request for the CDs even
though they did not have account with any of their websites (wiki,
launchpad, subversion repos, etc). Even now it is possible to create a
fake account in launchpad and request for the CD. But, at least now
they start tracking whom they are sending the CDs to and their
association with Ubuntu project teams.

I think for you to have a complete account in Launchpad you need to sing 
with your GPG/PGP keys, so it takes an extra effort to become an Ubuntero ;)

Isn't there an option to disable that feature? Digital
cameras, for example, add the date information to the
image, and under Setup you can always disable this
option.

Anyways, this is off-topic to this list, and I'll stop
here.

I think he is asking about the EXIF metadata.
If you use flickr, you can view an image's EXIF data by seeing the
right side bar under Additional Information.
All the details like - camera, exposure, aperture, focal length, etc
are all stored in the jpeg.
Is there any tool to change that data?

Yes. But for requesting CDs, you may not require to upload your
SSH/PGP keys. The keys are required when you are going to share your
patches with other developers using the bazaar version control system
integrated with launchpad. The keys are also required when you want to
become the member.

But I'll not be surprised if they expect the user to upload the keys
for requesting free CDs from feisty+1 release!

Subject: [Ilugc] IIT Madras Linux Users' group
Message-ID: <20070412034636.GA9772@localhost>

Dear ILUGC,

For the past 6-7 months, we have had an unofficial IIT Madras Linux
Users' group. The group is, basically, for residents and students of
IIT Madras who want to get a head start with using GNU/Linux and other
free/open source software in IIT Madras. The group has been lively,
and it is heartening to see even first year students
participating. Though there's nothing official about it, we do try to
meet up and talk about some things. For details, see:

http://groups.google.co.in/group/linuxusers_iitm/about

Regarding the success of this attempt, I strongly believe that it is
because students are allowed to access the internet from the
hostels. That, I feel, has allowed Googling and encouraged students to
try things out on their own machine, rather than depend on a machine
installed at a computer centre, where you can't (su)do whatever you
want.

And, of course, many thanks to Prof. Sriram, who's supported this
attempt, and has been maintaining the mirror at ftp.iitm.ac.in, which
is indispensable for Debian and Ubuntu users at IITM. Also, thanks to
Bharathi for helping out in the group, and ILUGC in general for
teaching some of us some things on and off the list.

Kumar

  IIRC, when you registering a launchpad account, there is an option to 
sign in GPG/PGP keys and in the profile there is a "Ubuntero: " option 
which becomes yes only when you have submitted your GPG/Keys. They can 
check whether the person requesting CDs is a serious Ubuntu user who has 
taken effort to register his keys and become an Ubuntero ;)

This means that it is for newly registered users. For
people who have been requesting from versions 5.10,
aren't asked to submit their GPG Keys?

And one can make GPG key only using Linux distros, right?

Kumar,

As far as I have seen only a very few like you attend ILUGC meets. Why 
do not bring in those from IITM Linux User Group to attend our ILUGC 
meets also, we will register more enthusiastic attendees then and 
probable we will get more speakers, volunteers and contribution ;). 21st 
is an opportunity :)

Well, very true. But then, even for our "mini-meets", people ahrdly do
come, for various reasons... but I hall forward the ILUGC talk mails
to the list.

(In fact, even I haven't been coming lately, due to various
reasons. But I'll make it on 21st.)

great news - now a days, among foss circles, we have more or less  
written off IITs for contributing as we have seen very little  
activity there. I am glad that old traditions are being revived

This is why I love apt:

$ apt-cache search exif
exif - command-line utility to show EXIF information in JPEG files
exiftags - Utility to read Exif tags from a digital camera JPEG file
exiftran - transform digital camera jpeg images
jhead - manipulate the non-image part of Exif compliant JPEG files
libjpeg-progs - Programs for manipulating JPEG files
 (among many others)

jhead looks the most promising. "apt-cache show jhead" provides:
 Upstream is: http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/

YMMV, etc.

Message-ID: <8ee1e7110704120003v39f1a1d5pa109e9cbfa98eb67@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
Im planning to get a R60 thinkpad. I would like to know if anyone has faced
any issues
running linux on it...
I've heard internal modems may be of some concern (but anyways i wont be
using that..so its OK)

Apart from this I need some expert advice/suggestion on choosing an
appropriate display for it.
The lenovo site gives me a choice like this:

1) 15" XGA TFT LCD with Wireless LAN
2) 15" SXGA+ TFT                                 -- A $50 extra for this one

Firstly, I really don't understand what a wireless LAN is doing in a
display. Next thing is in the
later part of the form when cutomizing the laptop.. I have options like
these to choose from

1) ThinkPad 11a/b/g Wi-Fi wireless LAN Mini-PCIe US/EMEA/LA/ANZ
2) Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG (US/CAN/LA/AP) --- $5 extra for this one..

So independent of the display i choose i can select either of these wireless
cards...
which I guess it means to say that the "Wireless LAN" thing in the display
options(opt 1)
is senseless. (or am I wrong?)

Now i want to know what is special in SXGA+ (other than the resolution
aspect of it)..
and the performance issues with the two wireless cards mentioned above...(ie
which is recommended)

and  also want to know what would be sufficient/recommended to run
compiz...among the below
1) Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950, 1394
2) ATI Mobility Radeon X1300 64MB,1394
3) ATI Mobility Radeon X1400 128MB, 1394

It'll be nice if people who have used a R60 or any thinkpad for that matter
.. could share
their experience on this regard.

Rgds
Harish

a friend got a lenovo notebook the other day - came with vista pre- 
installed, and when the license agreement came up, there was no  
option to reject the agreement, so he is being refused a refund for  
the cost of vista - be careful, you might wind up paying for vista

I have a R60 with 15" XGA and I don't see any shortcomings with the
display.
AFAIK, SXGA offers a higher resolution at 1280 x 1024.

The chipset I have is Intel 945GM and X.org has drivers for it, so I had
no problems.
Check if X.org has drivers for the chipset that you are choosing.

The default Thinkpad WLAN chipset is an Atheros chipset.
Mine has it and I have absolutely no problems using it.
I have used it in 11b and 11g modes, with WPA2.
Ubuntu has introduced the restricted drivers policy, so installing
madwifi drivers for Atheros' chipsets is a breeze now.

I haven't used Compiz or Beryl extensively, though I did try it once
and it ran well using the onboard Intel 945GM chipset.
Choosing ATI would surely enhance the experience, I guess.
And maybe, ATI's tradition of horrible linux drivers would change after
AMD's acquisition.

Happily running Gentoo :)

BTW when I got it couple of months back I got it without any OS 
pre-installed, which I don't think is an option now.

You have a license agreement screen with only a single button on it (you 
can easily guess what that would be ;)

Some of the R-series Thinkpads do come without windows pre-installed (I
got my R51 this way) - just ask them if they could provide the system
without Windows - normally they should have that option. In this case,
it will only come with DOS.

Thinkpads work very well with Linux - haven't heard anyone who I know
who got a Thinkpad complain about Linux compatibility - just get the
laptop without Windows, load up Ubuntu and you're good to go. Things
like hibernate, suspend, etc should just work.

IMHO, a 15" screen with just 1024x768 resolution is pointless (its
what I have btw) - it just adds on to the bulk, with no additional
utility. You'd be better off with smaller (wide-)screens (Dunno if
such configurations are available for Thinkpads). Or go for SXGA.

The R51/R52 are both IBM Models. The first R series model that's
designed by Lenovo is the R60. There are significant changes,
including some blatantly obvious and poor (IMHO) elements such as USB
ports on the right side, very plasticky and cheap-feeling build of the
keyboard and some buttons (like the sound buttons) makes

My point is that the R60 is not just a newer version of the R52 - it
is a redesigned machine that Lenovo wants to use to target the same
market segment as the R52 (folks on a budget). As such you should be
careful not to generalize linux-compatibility issues across the entire
R Series.

I haven't used a Thinkpad, but Beryl works great for me with Intel
915GM integrated graphics card (and I know others for whom it works
too) with an average of 40-90 fps depending on how many apps are open,
so my guess is that it should work fine for 950 :)

Haven't tried it on an ATI yet.

Dear Harish,
             ATI Proprietary Linux drivers are great and offer very
smooth performance with high frame rates. The only problem is that they
lack the support for Composite Extension, needed for AIGLX (Indirect
rendering). Even the Open Source radeon driver doesnt support the R500
series (to which both X1300 and X1400 belong). I use a X1800XT with XGL
and ATI Propreitary fglrx drivers here. Both Beryl and Compiz run
smoothly. GMA 950 has good open source driver support with the i810
driver and also supports AIGLX. But, the chipset is a damn slow one, and
few effects may be slow like Rotating cube with transperancy enabled,
water effects, snow effects and all. Especially water and snow as they
use pixel shaders, which are a sore point for the GMA 950. I'd say go
for the X1400. ATI Rocks.. :)

Regards,

Karthik

What would be your recommendation for this ? Also mention the price if you know.

I have zeroed upon LinkSys WRT54GL, a vendor here in chennai quotes it
at 3.6k. Would be running one of the 3rd party firmwares like dd-wrt
or openwrt ...

Searched for WRTSL54GS, but it seems its not available in chennai, the vendor
told. This one has a usb port where one can hook up an external hdd. would have
been cool as a music/file/download server ...

I'd prefer with the USB port.

You should have an account in launchpad website. When you create the

I guess you may create GPG keys if you have cygwin installed in any MS

Hi

Dont Know about the  Price  but please don't use any WRT54GS -- not worth
it.

You may go ahead and use WRT54GL--

http://www.sveasoft.com/modules/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=18286

 I was working as a linksys trouble shooting techy once-- so take my word --
do not buy - a regular  WRT54G  or WRT54GS or the so called pre-N or Draft-n
MIMO- WRT 300N--  THey are all useless-- none compatible with third party
firm ware

Raj

Hello,
     There is an s/w in opensuse 10.1 with the hep of which you can comment
your images. The application name is "fhoto". What I think is that your
mobile phone is storing the details of your photo in its header
information. You can always change the details of the image. You will have
to remove the header information contained in your photo.How to do that??
try to search for any convertor.Search by extension name. You can get help
from the mobile vendor. Just commenting the image will not help (but still
you may try).

>now, ant application that helps to edit, erase these metadata?
Can you explain a bit more..

Offtopic: but why would anyone want to buy any Thinkpad product in India
since Lenovo offers criminally bad deals in India (hint: check their US
site. Or were you considering buying from the US in the first place?)

Other companies such as Dell, HP etc offer much better notebooks in India
at a price point lower than Lenovo's Thinkpad. At a lower price than a
R60, you can get a AMD Turion X2 machine with WIFI, DVD Writer, 512MB RAM
etc from Dell and the Dell Inspiron 1501's WiFi does work with Linux
Kernel 2.6.20-12 with NDISWrapper.

IMHO, you cannot compare Dell, HP notebooks to Lenovo ThinkPads.
Just curious, have you worked on ThinkPads before, would you rate this 
comparison to be a fair one?

Yup. Im buying it from the US. The lenovo site I was referring to was indeed
lenovo.com/us. In fact the lenovo thinkpads for india are heavily priced and
also do not offer any cutomization options..

Message-ID: <809586140704122041q6431dd1du6b4654e51cda8733@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
        I would like to know the recommendation of the best wireless
adapters known to work under linux (pref under CentOS 4) for setting
up as a AP. I did a bit of google on this and came to know about the
Atheros and Prism chip sets.

I would like to know which brand/model supports these chipsets and its
availability in Ritchie Street.

Are there any other adapters known to work under linux and suitable to
work in master mode, that is available in Ritchie Street.

I also have a doubt, can ndiswrapper drivers be used for setting AP in linux.

Please let me know about these.

PS. I am new to the wireless world.

Thanks,

Depends. Compare a Dell Latitude to a Thinkpad T60 or X60

And their lower end notebooks (Inspiron etc) to lower end Thinkpad
series like the R series.

Hi,

 I dont know if these models will be working under  AP mode or not. But
these models  do work under  cent OS-- actually - RHEL 4 and fedora  with
out any need for ndis wrappers--

wpc54g--- This is a laptop model
wmp11 and wmp54g-- PCI cards for desktops-  802.11b and g models.

Heard even dlink ones will work  but am not sure

regards
Raj

If you google for 'voice modem asterisk' - there are quite a lot of

Actually, you will find that very very few patches are directly made to 
the kernel itself - the Windows kernel runs very different from the 
Linux one. Also, technically SP1 and SP2 were considered to be different 
releases as far as I know. And I do recall there being a lot of noise 
about drivers not working on SP2 when it came out initially. Sort of 
like the new Vista stuff - its taken them almost a year and half to get 
*some* of the drivers working right, a lot of hardware out there is 
still not really running ok on Vista.

You have this very wrong. MS dont update and add functionality at that 
level of the system once its released. You never see the -devel or 
-trunk version of the Windows system level at all. you only see whats 
been released and called stable from them. What you are doing here is 
comparing an evolutionary process of the Linux kernel development to the 
waterfall process of the Windows system.

It seems from your statements that you havent really ever used a stable 
distro before ? Could I ask what distro you really use ?

I actually meant what I said, I have a single binary kernel module that 
drives my 3ware 9550, without needing a recompile, for 2 years and its 
seem quite a few kernels. I dont even need to do anything at all beyond 
a yum update kernel. The machine has no kernel-devel or kernel sources ( 
also, you dont usually need the complete kernel-sources to build 
drivers, you should only need the headers - there are a few exceptions 
though )

Ok, so you are completely wrong and mis-informed about this. ( as I type 
this from my Acer Ferrari 4005, running an ATI prop driver, that I 
_didnt_ need to recompile or do anything to, when I upgraded my laptop 
last night from centos-5/beta to centos-5/final x86_64 ).

Also, whats a pre-comiled header ?

> My point: If binary drivers can be supported by requiring companies to

Your point is mostly irrelevant since its based on an assumption that is 
not really correct at all, might I even dare call it FUD spreading ?

Ok, again you seem to be comparing oranges and apples. eg, a driver 
written for win98 is not really going to work on win vista. ( iirc, it 
was driving abstraction that held up vista work for a fair portion of 
its 5 year delay to release ) - so expecting a 2.4 driver to work with 
2.6 is ... maybe a bit too extreme.

While it would be nice to happen, and yes - there are things that might 
be done to make it happen, feel free to submit patches.

Not they dont, have you seen the souces for nvidia or ati ?  And while 
these companies might get some stick from the linux users, one thing 
that people dont say is that these drivers dont work ( well, I dont 
anyway and I have both nvidia and ati installed all over the place ).

You are also grossly generalizing when it comes to hardware vendors. Not 
  everyone even wants to support Linux or any non windows product base 
since they lack the technical ability to do so, and the users are not 
asking for the support - remember this is not windows land where one 
might expect drivers from hardware vendors, we prefer a driver in the 
included kernel. hell, most people will frown upon vendors who are not 
pushing the driver upstream for adoption - and guess what ? once that 
does get adopted - no more worries about hardware not working, whatever 
stable / unstable / head / branch you might be using!

hopefully I would have cleared out some of these in the email now ?

> Some questions for you:

> a) Why don't you get the source drivers for ATI?

to be honest with you - as long as they dont push for upstream adoption 
( and going by the conversations we had with ATI a few weeks back, some 
serious wackage will need to happen before they even think about it ) - 
I dont really care. Vendors on Linux have 2 options, the one most 
preferred by users and linux (ab)users is of upstream adoption. However 
if companies choose not to do that - guess what ? its a free world.... 
they can choose to support their hardware from the outside. As long as 
things work, I am fine with that.

why would I even want to ? everything just works for me anyway... yes, I 
am using the ati prop drivers on my laptop. I have suspend to ram, 
hibernate to drive, I can dual head my laptop with no problems ( hey 
even tripple head it! ), the wifi card works out of the box ( bcm43xx ), 
bluetooth works, tv-out works... i even get 11,000+ on glxgears ( 
important, since I do fancy a bit of Wolf3D:ET at times )

humm...

ok, so we've established that your point is mostly irrelevant.

so stop using upstream kernels. And if it really bothers you so much, 
fork it. Like i said before, its a free world.

You seem confused about exactly what constitutes an 'upstream' 
development process and what is the user deliverable 'distro'. While in 
a lot of ( Majority ? ) cases they might seem fused, in most of the 
linux user world people dont use upstream. ( gentoo [ab]users excluded 
*duck* )

Havent made double figures since I left the job that required me to, but 
I did work with the team that made it to 9 drivers. Also, I've done a 
lot of stabalisation work with the ahci stuff ( specifically jmicron and 
areca hardware ).

yes, the user expectation is very different on Windows and Linux. Most 
linux distro deliver a complete user experience in a consolidated manner.

again, you are very wrong on this - Windows does ship with a fair few 
drivers, and I'll try to explain why this is. When WinXP went completely 
bottoms up and prompted MS to look at SP1, a team of analysts were 
brought in to find out exactly what was going on and why the system was 
so unstable. The findings of these people were a straight pointer to 
badly done drivers from third party vendors. Most hardware vendors dont 
actually write their own driers, they farm the jobs out to consultants 
and outsourcing companies. And *this* was the biggest problem with 
stability that MS had to contend with for a long time.

on the other hand, apart from one exceptionally wierd SMC sata hotswap 
bay driver that seems to leek memory and needs a reload every 4 to 5 
months, I've not had any issues with linux drivers. And before you say 
it, I know its a generalisation - but, I *do* use a lot of kit, some in 
obscure setups too.

that is exactly what my point was, they ship commodity hardware mostly, 
things that work fine on PC's a well - but the user base actually looks 
up what works before going out to buy it!

I'd suggest the best way to find out is to actually use this thing, I am 
starting to wonder if you even use linux at all, and that too in a 
stable environment where these things matter.

If what you mean to ask is regarding the Windoze virus, please go
ahead and remove it. Many of us consider Windoze itself a virus, and
have either removed it long back, or never installed it.

I don't think you will get a better answer than this in this
forum. Please consult a more relevant forum.

Fransic, Just because you have a Edubuntu installed doesn't prove your 
question to be relevant to this mailing list. Please avoid asking 
questions not related to the purpose of this mailing list, until it is 
closely related to it or you are looking for an alternate solution in

Hi,
Its less expensive in US and Singapore. I have a R51,
but the internal modem does not work. Guess its a
winmodem.

I heard from my friends (sysadmins who work lot on
linux) that thinkpads were robust . Toshiba is pretty
good too. 

Finally, its requirements that matters. I find the 15"
screen better for programming than smaller wider
screens.

I did not have the option of getting without windows. 
Thinkpads come with recovery discs. If u resize
partition, recovery discs dont work. Tryin to upgrade
to bigger drive and stuck because I cant clone the
drive. Maybe I should try dd or maybe mondo. any
ideas? going to connect new disk through usb.

regards,
sanjay

I came across this gem of a tool to view images when you are in
command line mode. and if you are a cli person, this is a blessing.

the tool is fbi. 'apt-get install fbi' will install it on a debian based
system.

to use fbi, you need to pass the 'vga=' param to kernel to specify
resolution and depth for framebuffer. i use 'vga=0x315' for 800x600
res. and 24 bit depth. (edit your lilo.conf or menu.lst)

now once you reboot (if you added the vga option), you can invoke
fbi from command line with the image name as an argument, to
view the image. however it can do more than that. man fbi.

my original itch was to be able to view images while using lynx. now, once
fbi installed, and when you are in lynx interface, go to options and do
the following two changes:
1. Set X-Display to 'fbi' (type in fbi)
2. Set 'Show image' to 'as links'

Save it. (unfortunately the above two options do not get written to lynx
conf file. you need to set it for evey session with lynx)

Now lynx will start showing the images as links. navigate to the image
link and press right arrow. you will be able to see the image - all in
command line.

cheers,
saha

fbi is part of fbida project:

fbgs is useful in viewing ps/pdf files on the

There is also another tool called zgv (apt-get install zgv) that 
works on machines with SVGAlib configured.

For using graphics capable web browser from command-line, you can 
try Links2 (apt-get install links2).

Its nice to see Tamil in Ubuntu and other stuffs. It would be nice if you
send messages both in tamil as well as english as many would (including me)
find it difficult to read in tamil :(

Hey all,

I found a 40GB hdd. As i heard, it has problem that it cannot be detected.
But, when i inserted it into my computer, it got it. And from /dev directory
i found that, it is
hdc
hdc1
hdc2
hdc5 (vfat)

Now, i wanted to mount it with

sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hdc5 /mnt/other_hdd

and the message came:
"can't read superblock"

Now, how can i read the datas of that hard-disk. Those datas are really

I would like to request some one to take a session on fonts, encoding,
input methods, keyboard... the inter relation between them...

would expect the lecture to cover:

1) brief history of fonts, encodings, keyboard layouts, input methods

2) Keyborad Layouts... (from indian languages perspective... not
QWERTY or Dvorak, particularly Tamil...)

2) Different types of fonts etc., how computer manipulates ??+? = ??
and displays its etc.,

3) Encoding... Unicode in particular and basic intro as to how to
write a C/ C++ program with the replacement of "Hello World" to be
something like "??????? ???????!" :-)

4) Input Methods.. SCIM, SKIM etc., and how to design our own keyboard
layouts...

5) how are all these inter-related...

any one?

Hi,

My thoughts below:

Most of us, I believe, have a copy of the video
lectures by Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman on
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs".

http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/

We could play three lectures a day [1], and then have
a discussion?

There are twenty lectures, so, we can have three
lectures every Saturday?

Saturday, May 12, 2007
Saturday, May 19, 2007
Saturday, May 26, 2007
Saturday, June 2, 2007

Now that colleges have "exams", we won't be able to do
any workshops. So, we can use this time to learn Lisp.

If people are interested to come on Sunday too, we can
finish faster.

Appreciate your feedback,

This is a nice idea, trying a new thing for LUG meets especially when we 
do not have volunteers to give a talk. At least we can watch the lecture 
  and have a discussion about it :)

Yes, when the college opens we will be able to give a hour talk from 
what we got from SICP.

Think so, I have seen people storing Lays and kurkure inside some labs. 
We just have to make sure we do not litter around.

Check the partition type from the output of the 'fdisk -l /dev/hdc'
and then try to mount. Also check the /var/log/messages for any
errors.

Aye, if there is nothing else, a live talk on something is always better, imho.

What discussions?  Anyone who has worked a large program in scheme?
Maybe we can have a general lisp/scheme talk after/before/around the
lecture? :)

This sounds good.

Seconded. It's a confusing mess out there for the uninitiated (as my
"keyboards" thread touched upon) and an overview of what's what and where it
belongs would be very useful. I'd be more than happy to take notes from the
talk and turn them into an online resource if that would encourage someone
who can speak somewhat authoritatively on the topics to give the
presentation!

I can try this one: Scheme is after all my language of choice and any
opportunity I get to talk about it I can be rather hard to shut up! Can
anyone source a wizard hat and robe like Sussman's? ;-)

I can't promise anything about my presentation style, or failing to leave
you confused about the plethora and diversity of Scheme implementations, and
opinions of what Scheme Should Be, that exist; but am more than happy to
attempt a mass conversion to the Cult of Funtional Programming. As for
Common Lisp, I'll have to refrain from mentioning it as I know very little.

Cheers,

I could give a talk on Lisp, specifically Emacs Lisp (just the
language aspects). I had given such a talk a long time back at a ilugc
meet, and wrote up the following based on the talk material.
http://www.cs.utah.edu/~karra/tutorial/

The talk can last upto 2 hours depending on interaction. Further, I
will not be in Madras for the next ilugc meet, and for the forseeable
future. So if there is interest in this topic, it has to be this time.

+1 for this weekend's meet.

Nice to see a few people ready to talk, though we did not have many 
replies for Bharathi's earlier mail ;)

We can have a talk on Lisp and if possible, an introduction to scheme 
this time. Based upon the interest, we can fix up the dates to show the 
lecture video starting from this Sunday or next Saturday :)

As much as I feel it violates my Sixership [*] I'd be quite interested in
such a talk myself. Maybe I can rant about Scheme at a future meet. Or just
heckle throughout about Scheme's obvious superiority ;-).

You are right in that the Linux kernel and Windows kernel are implemented
very differently with Windows XP (not 95/98) implemented as a microkernel
with a lot of the functionality implemented using subsystems.

However, Windows service pack updates do change kernels as well. For
instance, Service Pack 2 update included support in the kernel for
additional memory protection including DEP (Date Execution Protection).
>From Microsoft's page on this:

"Data execution prevention (DEP) is a set of hardware and software
technologies that perform additional checks on memory to help protect
against malicious code exploits.  In Windows XP SP2, DEP is enforced by
both hardware and software."

Please see:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/sp2mempr.mspx

If your statement that windows does not make kernel-level updates is to be
believed, how is that you claim that windows service pack updates cause
problems with drivers?

>"a lot of hardware out there is still not really running ok on Vista."

Please list one or two. My point is not that these service pack updates
work perfectly. Occassionally, service pack updates will cause disruptions
with the drivers. However, that is an exception and not the rule. A
service pack update has yet to cause *ALL* the users to download *ALL* the
drivers.

With Linux, when you install Linux kernel via yum update, you will also
download the driver modules for that version. That is, you will be
downloading *ALL* the drivers for that version of Linux that comes as
standard with the Linux kernel tree.

This statement makes no sense. I made no comparison between the
development models of Linux and Windows and in anycase that has no bearing
on the discussion.

I have used Linux since 1994 and I have used a variety of distros starting
with slackware, Redhat, Suse, Mandrake, Vector, Fedora Core x etc.

You seem to be unaware that all Linux kernel releases from 2.4.3 already
includes the 3ware 9550 driver.

I restate myself here - when you install Linux kernel via yum update, you
will also download the driver modules for that version. That is, you will
be downloading *ALL* the drivers for that version of Linux that comes as
standard with the Linux kernel tree. Yum would have downloaded the binary
version of the driver.

If 3ware 9550 *BINARY* drivers are compatible across kernels, why are they
providing these kernel specific driver downloads?

See:
http://www.3ware.com/kb/article.aspx?id=14546

For clarity and emphasis - There is NO SUPPORT in Linux for *BINARY*
drivers which work across kernel releases. If the source driver for 3ware
9550 did not exist as part of the Linux kernel, you would have had to
download and install a binary version of the 3ware 9550 driver for each
version of linux kernel that you use.

Both ATI as well as NVIDIA provide binary drivers but they utilize a
work-around to solve this problem of lack of support for binary drivers.

Both Nvidia and ATI utilize what are known as "Kernel Interface Layers".
These "Kernel Interface Layers" are compiled during the installation of
the drivers from either ATI or Nvidia and for this the Kernel Headers must
be present on disk. These kernel interface layers provide the interface to
the binary drivers.

Besides the kernel interface layer provided as source, Nvidia (I am not
sure about ATI) now comes with precompiled  kernel interface layers for
the popular linux kernel releases. The driver installer will choose what
precompiled kernel interface layer to use during installation time. If a
precompiled interface layer is not available for the version of Linux
kernel installed on your machine (even if it is just a point difference),
the installer will attempt to recompile the kernel interface layer code
for that version of the kernel. That is the reason the kernel headers must
reside on your machine.

See:
http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-9755/README/chapter-02-section-03.html

For ATI:
http://ati.amd.com/support/drivers/linux/linux-radeon.html

NOTE: Please notice the text on this page that mandates that kernel
headers are required if the entire kernel source is not present.

Also see:
http://linuxhelp.150m.com/ati/ati.htm

So my point:

1. No, Linux does not support *pure* binary drivers without an
intermediate layer which must be compiled separately for each point
release of the kernel.

2. Please take time to do some research first. Any of what I have pointed
out could have been verified if you had bothered to take 15 minutes to
research it.

3. I have used Linux for 13 odd years now. But whether I have used Linux
for a day or a hundred years doesn't matter. What matters is if I what I
am saying is true or not. Judge what is said based on its own merits.

4. Linux is a good OS and I use it a lot. But it has faults. If saying
that is FUD, so be it. Sue me.

Linux kernels 2.6.14 (and NOT 2.4.3 as stated in my last email) and newer
include a driver for the 3ware 7000/8000/9500S/9550SX/9550SXU/9590SE

One question - Why is it that Linux Kernel API is not backward
compatible? What is the design logic that goes with this. Why not hold
back major overhauls and use workarounds until major revisions.
Cleanly document and maintain required overhauls and implemented
workarounds in a public repository until application/driver developers
get around to fixing it by the time for the major revision?

you seem to be having the argument for the sake of the argument now.

thinks this is pure noise, perhaps we should move it off list..

that is sort of my point, the service packs are considered to be a major 
update, a sort of snapshot in time release.

perhaps you need to look at how drivers work on windows. there is an 
abstraction layer and most interfacing is done via there. anyway, I have 
near zero interest in discussion windows architecture here.

connextant adsl2 pci modems, is one thing I know about since a friend of 
mine ( works for MS in their OS team, at that ) has this modem and is 
unable to get it working with Vista...

Also, I know personally that lots of the promise raid drivers have 
massive issues with windows.

there you go, 2 specific issues.

that is a packaging issue, nothing to do with the kernel specific. feel 
free to use a delta/rdiff format for packaging delivery if you so wish, 
last I heard there were a few options for that.

perhaps it makes no sense to you, but it defines the devel to user 
delivery policy. Which, some might argue, is the crux of your confusion 
in the matter here ( see below for more explanation )

none of these are either considered enterprise grade or stable by anyone 
really. So my question still stands - have you used a stable enterprise 
distro ? eg. look at Suse - they had kabi stabalisation worked out 
before pretty much anyone - or look at centos-4 and the whitelisting / 
kabi assurance system built in. I fear you are making a lot of noise 
without actually having used a system that provides the very platform 
you are looking for.

you seem to have pulled this one our of your ass really. I am running 
2.6.9-EL branch on my home server, there was no 9550sx support in it 
till U4 really - and even then I continue to use the .ko since I have 
some xfs specific code in there.

( saw your email that 2.6.14 had the driver... thats ok, i dont use 
unstable upstream kernels :) )

again, this is based on assumption from you - tell me, do you see a 
driver for each kernel released on rhel4 ? or only for the installtime 
kernels ? as far as I can tell, they are only install time drivers there :)

One of the developers on CentOS has been talking to them to start using 
the whitelisting process that vmware use so as to not need to do this at 
all, and hopefully they should adopt that soon.

thats a falacy you seem to have convinced yourself of, and now seem to 
want to push that as an argument. And you seem to completely ignore the 
fact that there is another option that exists, you just (a) dont know 
about it (b) refuse to accept it.

I thought that I cleared that one of your issues out with my details on 
the ATI setup I have here ? Dont make me repeat all that please.

I have repeatedly pointed out with specific details, as to why that is 
not true - but yes, its a free world. If you have convinced yourself of 
this, then feel free to believe it.

umm... this is strange, since its you who has repeatedly ignored 
specifics that I have pointed out - its really you who needs to go do 
some research. Btw, start with weak-updates and ko whitelisting in el5 
as a starting point on how a stable distro sort of gurantee's that a 
driver stays usable as kernels update during the life of a distro. The 
suse guys have some really good docs on this as well.

I dont think you are completely wrong, but I am quite sure what you are 
saying is not a true reflection of the state of being. If you really 
dont care about anything else that a distro does or what a users uses 
and just want to focus on the nightly kernel build with a nightly 
snapshot of absolutely everything else on your system - you might then 
start to get into a situation you describe. but even then, you will find 
that its not completely true.

> 4. Linux is a good OS and I use it a lot. But it has faults. If saying

Like I said its a free world ( or atleast we like to think it tends to 
be ) so I dont really care what you think - But what I do care about is 
that when you do send out a blanket statement to say something that is 
not correct, someone needs to point you in the right direction.

NOTE: talking about specifics, do you know that nvidia only rebuild the 
.ko they ship for el4/centos4 when they themselves update code, and not 
when a kernel update takes place on these distros ?

Topic: Introduction to "Emacs Lisp - The Language"  By Sriram Karra

Abstract:

If there is one fundamental thing that distinguishes Emacs from its
competition, it is that the extension language for Emacs is a variant
of Lisp, a highly elegant and full blown high level functional
language. In this talk, we will explore the basic building blocks of
Emacs Lisp; at which level it is very similar to Common Lisp. We will
discover how it is different from other procedural languages, how many
of the 'modern' programming concepts in popular languages of the past
decade are really old ideas built into a fifty year young language.

This talk will not help you use Emacs better. However, you *cannot*
call yourself an expert Emacs user or realize its full potential
unless you can understand Lisp. This talk will certainly help you get
started on that life long journey. Further, the talk is *really* about
the language. So even if you never intend to use Emacs, come along if
you just want to know what all the hype about Lisp is.

Topic: "Introduction to Haskell" By Rajagopal Natarajan

Abstract: 

This talk will cover the basics of Haskell and then on how well it
fits in for some real world applications like Music generation, Music
processing, Bio-informatics, etc.

Subject: [Ilugc] Indian govt FLOSS initiatives?
Message-ID: <20070417220854.A26072@Snorkel.rtfm.net.au>

Hi,

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but my google-fu has been weak. Is there a
portal (or something to the effect) for Indian Government FLOSS initiatives? I
spent a silly amount of time trying to track down the much-publicised work on
localising Linux and OOo before the release (?) announcement of
http://bosslinux.in/ was posted. Given the absence or staleness of sites
related to BharateeyaOOo I can only assume that work has been absorbed into
OpenOffice core localisation projects. In particular, I have recently been
informed of the existence of a project building software for medical practices
targetting rural India, but given past disappointments, and not much idea of
where to start, I am not very hopeful of my chance to track this down.

Surely there's some place where information and more importantly links to these
projects is collated?

Alternatively, can anyone report on simple FLOSS solutions for a rural medical
practice? Honestly the biggest barrier to entry is frequent power failures, but
I'm in the process of building a patient database using that wonderful tool
called a Spreadsheet, and the question has been raised as to the feasibility of
computerising a lot more of their work. If I can find a suitable software
solution, funds for a suitable UPS can be raised :-).

You should subscribe to egovindia yahoo group. The group is meant to
discuss about initiatives taken by various Govt. organizations in
India. It is not just about the FLOSS, but they also discuss about
eGovernance, RTI and FLOSS initiatives.

*WARNING* - LONG EMAIL

My point has always been:

1) Linux does NOT support BINARY-ONLY drivers. If you are contending that
pure BINARY drivers are supported on Linux, then I will need to see some
references/URLs for that. This has been discussed multiple times on the
kernel mailing lists and the Linux maintainers have consistently refused
to include support for BINARY-ONLY drivers in Linux. One of the reasons
stated against it is that it would violate GPL.

See:
http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/stable_api_nonsense.html

The Linux maintainers contend that *ALL* linux drivers must be part of the
Linux kernel source tree.

2) Binary drivers from companies such as Nvidia and ATI are supported via
kernel interface layers which are provided by these same companies. These
kernel interface layers are provided in two forms - a) Precompiled for
specific kernel versions b) In source form. If a precompiled version is
not available for your specific kernel release, then you must necessarily
compile the kernel interface layer and for this kernel version and for
this you will need a minimum of the kernel headers on your machine.

I am resending the links which will explain this:

See:
http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-9755/README/chapter-02-section-03.html

For ATI:
http://ati.amd.com/support/drivers/linux/linux-radeon.html
NOTE: Please notice the text on this page that mandates that kernel
headers are required if the entire kernel source is not present.

Also see:
http://linuxhelp.150m.com/ati/ati.htm

Address these points without using offensive language.

So, whats your point?

The reason I had posted that link was to inform you that unlike what you
had stated, service packs do sometimes update the kernel as well.

And despite that, most *BINARY* drivers will still continue to work on
windows - you may come out and say that the driver for this one device or
two devices didn't work - but what you forget to mention is that the
drivers for literally 1000s of other devices continue to work without any
disruption even with a kernel update on windows. I am referring to
*BINARY-ONLY* drivers.

See my previous comment.

No, I am not referring to any packaging issue. I am referring to the fact
that the drivers have to be recompiled for each linux kernel release or
someone else has to provide the precompiled drivers for you for each
kernel release.

Also, see my initial set of points - Linux does NOT support BINARY-ONLY
drivers. This is NOT a packaging problem. Again, see my Point 1 at the top
of the email.

Let me repeat. It is NOT a packaging problem. Neither is it a delivery
problem and it has ABSOLUTELY NO bearing on whether Linux supports
binary-only drivers or not.

I am not going to get into a pointless debate about what is a "stable"
distro. In anycase, that is not the point of the discussion.

Also, by the way, the architecture for the Linux kernel on poor "unstable"
distros such as slackware and those on the enterprise linuxes is the same.
What is different about the enterprise kernels is that some drivers may be
removed, some new drivers may be added in, some parameters may be tweaked
etc.

OK, I know there are additional tools:

for example:
http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/Using_the_SLES9_kernel-update-tool_to_Update_Kernel_Modules

and differences in the userland etc in enterprise linuxes.. and also the
far more rigorous qualification process,  but I am constraining my
discussion to just the kernel for now.

Talking about kABI - that is just an acronym for Kernel Application Binary
Interface. When you refer to the "kabi assurance", I am guessing that you
are referring to the kABI notification system available for those such as
partners of the Novell Partner Linux Driver Process.

See:
http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/Partner_Linux_Driver_Process

Under the Novell Partner Linux Driver Process, hardware vendors can
register their drivers with the Partner Linux Driver Process. When a user
tries to download a driver, YaST will check to see what version of the
driver to download (corresponding to the user's kernel version) and will
fetch the appropriate driver from the repository.

About kABI, kABI is NOT a mechanism which allows BINARY-ONLY drivers to
function across kernel updates on Linux.

About kABI, from Novell's site: "kABI Notification Service - The term
?kABI? refers to the kernel Application Binary Interface, the set of
in-kernel symbols used by drivers and other kernel modules. (kABI does not
refer to the syscall interface used by user-space programs). The
mainstream Linux kernel is a dynamic entity and as such, there are
frequent changes to the kABI. While SUSE Linux kernel engineering teams
endeavor to maintain a stable kABI between service pack releases, security
updates may occasionally necessitate kABI changes. As part of the PLDP,
the kABI notification service has been created to provide Novell partners
with information about how their modules could be affected by upcoming
kABI changes. The kABI Notification Service also allows the SUSE Linux
kernel engineering teams to proactively assess (as part of their research
process) how proposed kABI changes might affect partner modules.

When a partner submits kABI information for a module, Novell Partner
Engineering places the information in its partner module repository. For
each new kernel release, Novell/SUSE checks the module's symbols against
the new kernel's kABI, then sends the partner an email detailing any
observed kABI incompatibilities. The kABI Notification Service thus gives
partners the information they need to ensure that their drivers and kernel
modules will work with upcoming SUSE Linux kernel releases."

If you are able to make a BINARY-ONLY driver work across kernel updates,
then that is a feature of Linux which even Linus Torvalds isn't aware off.

If there are *any* updates to the kernel headers, the driver depending on
them must be recompiled. There is no way around it.

Can you give me more details about this? How will this process help Linux
users to use BINARY-ONLY drivers?

There is a third option. c) You don't understand what I am saying (or may
be even a fourth) d) you choose not to.

Perhaps. Please furnish a few URLs which proves your point.

Are you also aware that the nvidia driver has to be rebuilt (by Nvidia)
only occassionally because of the kernel interface layer which they
provide and which must be recompiled for each kernel point release unless
a pre-compiled version for that kernel release exists? Again, please see
the link I have posted about this.

guys, that looks like a mass-grab-host-for-pay-per-click sort of site, 
does the .in registry not have a policy against allowing people to do 
that ?

If so, noise needs to be made about linux.in...

Is there anyone on this list who might have a legal interest and might 
be able to look at the .in registry toc/aup docs and make some sense out 
of those ?

we started talking about version specific stuff in the linux kernel and 
how that has an effect on users during the life of a distro... you seem 
to have taken off on a tangent, so in the interest of my own time, I am 
going to short circuit this conversation and not reply to your email :)

I have absolutely no interest in carrying on what people perceive to be 
an argument, just for the sake of doing so.

You want to join all the icann politics about "domain tasting" (or

My contention from the start has been that Linux does not support
BINARY-ONLY drivers and that as the linux kernel is updated on a user's
machine, he will need to recompile the drivers other than for one or two
specific cases ( a. The kernel interface layer is provided by the vendor
or b. The kernel headers and symbols remain exactly the same between the
two versions of the kernel)

I am quite happy to drop this conversation with you since it appears that
you haven't bothered to read my emails properly or to even visit the
links. However, there are others in this thread who may be able to give an
intelligent response to my email.

To bump this request:

I could really do with CD images of Ubuntu & Edubuntu 6.10. If someone is able
to bring these along to the meet I'd be more than grateful.

In fact, here's a far out idea: IITM maintains a mirror of the Ubuntu
repository, right? Is there any chance if I brought along a USB HDD someone
could arrange for the mirror to be mirrored onto my drive? A community-spirited
IITM student or staff member affiliated with ILUGC, for instance? I can start
the wget myself (under appropriate supervision, of course) and provide witty
banter and coffee/snack runs while it transfers. I could even use the time to
teach you some Scheme! :-)

This is very valid, but there is no systematic way to do this...

If you can find someone in the hostels who would be willing to allow
you to do this, you can do it. But I'll ask Dr. Sriram whether there
is more systematic way to get this done.

inspite of having given you specific examples ( which you seem to ignore 
completely ) I dont know why you continue to blow this horn... You are 
either (a) pushing an agenda and/or (b) clueless about how these things 
really work on a stable distro :)

eg. ( once again something specific here ) - the vmware kernel modules 
for their vmware-server download, is from the U1 days kernel on 
centos-4, they have not needed to rebuild anything since then, their 
drivers work fine for all kernels upto now. And to give you an idea of 
what that translates into, there have been over 900 modifications to the 
kernel since vmware built that .ko set ( bugfix, enhancements, new 
drivers being added, driver updates, stability fixs, security fixs etc ).

Across the same kernel version, with minimal changes in kernel headers?

This guy's point seems to be more suited to "across kernel versions" -
which you dismiss as you dont use "unstable upstream versions" and stick
to the RHEL kernel which backports stuff onto a single kernel version.

It is a packaging issue. And you're approaching it from different
directions entirely, refusing to believe either of you is right. Apples
to Oranges comparison ..

This end sem time, most of us are busy in finishing the assignments
and preparing for the final quiz. So I feel, sometime in 1st week of

Subject: [Ilugc] Help regarding configuring NAT in Redhat Linux
Message-ID: <38b8d1a50704182239u424cc5a4l26ff7401d88aaa9b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
In my project I needed NAT for connecting to external LAN (not internet)
from internal LAN . For this, I created IP alias eth0:1 to the interface
eth0 of single NIC and trying to use that system as NAT.

The steps I followed are ;;

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth0:1 -m state --state
RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0:1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT


*In **/etc/sysctl.conf*  *net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

while entering these commands, it is giving some kind of warning with eth0:1
about IP aliases

And later, the system in internal LAN is not pinging to the system in
external LAN. The NAT system itself is pinging well both to the internal and
external LANs.

Can you pls tell me wether I can use aliases for NAT and if yes how to
implement them using Iptables or some another way in Redhat Linux. Iam very
near to the project deadline and got stuck with this . Urgent pls help...

iptables doesn't support virtual interfaces?

You have to do SNAT based on the packets:

Hi,
Have any of you tried kmil, scim and pango in ubuntu for any indian
languages. I had successfully set up ubuntu 6.10 for reading and
writing(using trasliteration) in malayalam but could not replicate it
in ubuntu 7.04. Setting up for reading seems to be fine but writing
seems to get stuck. Is there somebody who has worked on this issue
here?

Subject: [Ilugc] [Job] Have ideas -> Need hacker(s)
Message-ID: <462A7540.6050904@gmail.com>

Dear group,

Hello. I have been a passive member for a long time in the group. 
Appreciate the efforts taken by the guys - especially after seeing 
today's meet.

A bit of introduction is in line here - please bear with me for just a 
minute. I am a freelance IT consultant/developer/manager (yes, different 
hats) working on various platforms (J2EE, Python, Rails, etc.) and in 
various domains (retail, insurance, etc).

Anyways, coming to the point of the post, I am working seriously on two 
start-up ideas - one to do with SaaS in the financial services industry 
in the US and the other (probably more interesting to the guys here) has 
got to do with music. In fact in the latter, we (another person and 
myself) are amongst the final 7 of the business plan competition being 
held by Intel and are in serious talks with various VCs.

On both fronts, I am looking for serious hacker(s) in the true sense of 
the word. The potential person needs to be:
* a technology guru - if that was not very obvious :)
* ability to learn and adapt to new technologies/platforms/approaches
* problem solving needs to be your passion
* probably either already work for a start-up and want to join as a 
founder or wants to get out of routine services jobs and wants to do 
something on their own
* wants to work on a variety of new (and some old :) ) concepts and 
ideas in an ever-changing environment

If you noticed, I didn't mention professional experience - because I 
don't really believe in that - if I did, I would not have started out as 
a freelancer right after graduation.

I am open to a variety of terms of engagements ranging from part-equity/ 
part-compensation to pure compensation to pure equity. Basically I am a 
very flexible person and I am sure we can work something out based on 
your current requirements.

Guys interested can ping me off-list via the same email ID or via  my 
mobile on 94441 01706. Would love to have a chat with you and see how we 
can take it forward.

Thanks and sorry for the pretty long email. Just thought I had to be 
very clear whilst putting across my points.

Thanks and good luck.

Hi,

Assume there is a kernel module for a simple usb device(surely, this is not
a block device).
it does not have major and minor number assinged, instead it has attribute
files on /sys directory. so that user application can access.
then, what kind of driver this is? still, is it a char device driver?

device?

> (surely, this is not

USB is an interfacing protocol. Depending on the
device that is connected, the corresponding USB class
driver is used, which determines its mode of
operation. 

If you connect a USB thumb drive, then it is a mass
storage device, and /dev/sda1 (for example) is a block
device.

If you connect a USB-to-serial converter, you will use
/dev/ttyUSB0 (for example), which is a character
device.

Then how will you access the device?

sysfs [1] provides device and driver information to
user-space, which is implemented as part of the driver
[2].

Ohh, Ok. I now see what you meant. This is an example
for USB device access using /sysfs.

A good example for what you are trying to do is here:

Your questions are too generic.

It depends on what context you mean by "driver" in the
above.

> we can access this driver through files on sysfs.
> right?

Again, what do you mean by "access"? There are no
files in /sysfs. It is a "virtual" filesystem. You can
only read/write variables exported by the driver (for
configuration) through sysfs. You didn't read Chapter
14: Linux Device Model [1]?

I'll stop here.

Do you want to bust linux from your hard drive in the process or you
want linux on a fat32 partition?
You could use gparted. Theres even a livecd for gparted (quite a small
cd image)

I know couple of Ubuntu Members are here. This is just an FYI. Please
cast your votes for electing one of new member for the Ubuntu
Community Council.

 Members of the Ubuntu community,

 We have 5 nominations to expand the community council, and voting starts today.

 Each candidate is standing individually, so there are 5 separate
votes. If a majority of the voters approve that candidate, then (s)he
will be confirmed as a new member of the CC with a two year term.

 I would urge all formal members of the Ubuntu community to vote. The
formal members are those who are currently listed at:

   https://launchpad.net/~ubuntumembers/

 The polls themselves are listed at:

   https://launchpad.net/~ubuntumembers/+polls

 Please vote in all polls where you have a personal opinion on the
candidate's contribution to Ubuntu and their competence to sit on our
top governing board. There are candidates from a variety of
significant communities within Ubuntu, such as the Forums and the
documentation team, but once confirmed to the CC they will represent
the community as a whole and not any particular subteam - even if they
retain a position in one of the other team councils of the project.

 The Community Council is our highest governing body of the project,
and makes fundamental decisions around our community structure, and
code of conduct. They serve to mediate disputes and also appoint the
leaders of key community teams.

 We specifically have 5 independent candidates because we believe that
it's important to have a broad coverage of timezones and areas of
expertise on the CC.

 I'd like to thank Dennis Kaarsemaker, the CC secretary, for setting
up the polls, and the candidates for their willingness to serve. I
would ask folks who lead various communities within Ubuntu to draw the
attention of their members to these polls so that we get the broadest
participation in each of the decisions.

Hi All,

Is there any way to avoid file delete confirmation in unix ( apart
from rm -rvf  option ) while using rm command ?

Thanks,

Check the bashrc installed by your distro ($HOME/.bashrc or 
.bash_profile), most likely it has an alias for "rm".  Remove/Comment it.

Confirmation of delete while using rm command is an added precaution 
from accidentally deleting something. I wonder why you want to bypass it ?

The easiest way it to create an alias named something like 'deleteyes' 
for the command "rm -rvf". Beware this can erase something without warning.

( I will personally suggest having a alias delete for 'rm -iv' and 
rather use it instead of rm)

Message-ID: <260970.16995.qm@web52005.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

Hi all!!
I have written a GDBServer for Nucleus OS - PowerPC platform. The Server follows the GDB serial communication protocol (over RS232). 
The problem is I am not able to set the remote target as COM1 (or /dev/ttyS0). It shows the following error: -

(gdb) set remotedevice /dev/ttyS0
(gdb) set remotebaud 115200
(gdb) target remote /dev/ttyS0
Remote debugging using /dev/ttyS0
Ignoring packet error, continuing...
Ignoring packet error, continuing...
Ignoring packet error, continuing...
Couldn't establish connection to remote target
Malformed response to offset query, timeout
(gdb)

Is it mandatory that the device connected serially should acknowledge the packets sent by gdb (if at all its does so) while setting the remote target?

Please help !!
Thanks in advance.
Rajib

Doing `rm -i *' in a directory with 1000 files wont be your idea of fun :-)

Anyways, zsh has a nice option to confirm _once_ in case you use wild 
card characters for rm.

For safety (undo-ability), and neatness; un-alias "rm", and move
the-files-to-be-deleted to "/tmp" instead.

To also ensure privacy, create "~/tmp", move the-files-to-be-deleted to it
instead, and clean it up periodically.

*groan*..Just happened to bust about 12 gigs of data from my hard

When it comes to 'rm -rf'...Be Afraid..Be Very Very Afraid

File confirmation can be good in some cases, as you can see..

Well yeah... more so if it happens to be your friend's home folder...
:p Don't ask me what I did ;) (I am no con... I did it once to my
personal pic collection as well... I am happy I had the presence of
mind to do a Ctrl+C in time and reduce the damage to 20% of the
collection :) )

Hi,

may be we need to start contributing towards CD if we are really capable..
however the smaller amount it may be.. its the choice of the person who
gives the CD.. but he/ she can always suggest the beneficiary to contribute
to ChennaiLUG, BOSS, FSF & Ubuntu Tamil Team ;-) etc.,

also this will help to take it strong to the minds of people that "free as
in freedom and not free as in free beer" :-)

I could find very little people @ http://www.gnu.org.in/thankgnus (or the
list is not up to date??)

so time to think :-)

By the way, I have Feisty Fawn... both Kubuntu & Ubuntu... in T Nagar...

Noooooooo ... Think twice before do this.

Some months before , I had lots of .php files and also some temp files which 
was ended with php~ (tild) sign .
So i want to delete the temp files . I thought to give the following command

#rm -fr *~

 Buttttt , i had typed   #rm -fr *   then to type the tild sign instead of 
shift+~  i entered ENTER button . ;-(

( I had incremental backup for those files ..So my head escaped ;-)  )

So BECAREFULL with rm command ... particularly after lunch ;-).......

This thread has become the 'horror stories' thread :)

If i need to use * or any expression for rm, i usually would type the command
with command name as 'm' or something, read it carefully, and then replace
m with rm, and press return - specially on a server. it sort of guards against
accidental return key press.

m: command not found.

well, i _try_ to follow that, not that i follow it every time.

I had my share of frustration as well. In one case my file was a text file,
and i had to use 'dd', read chunks, search through using grep .... it was very
painful,  but worth it because the document was very important. could
automate it to some extent, because i knew exact phrases from the doc.

 Having the location of the device on board as part of the address. Like
having the slot no as part of the address, so that you can find out which

I respect the original Unix philosophy that the user knows what he/she 
is doing.  So, thats why most of the commands are designed in such a way 
that they don't prompt whether you're sure about doing the "correct thing".

A lot of folks have had bad experiences (or probably never had the 
experience to work on the original SYSV or SunOS, Solaris with "lame" 
shells -- not even KSH) and have been much comfortable only with recent 
fancy shells like Bash/TCSH/...

Of course there are chances of typos, but I would just check the command 
I type before hitting the Return key.  I would never like something like 
"WARNING! Are you sure you want to delete all files? This action is not 
reversible!" when I'm invoking "rm *" -- of course I know what I'm doing 
damn it!!

Just my view of this "horror stories" thread.

Maybe I am evil to the core, but I cant help wishing that you delete
your '~' with an innocent 'rm * -rf' after a heavy intake of lunch ;).

It may happen, if you are running the minicom on same serial port or

Hi,

I'm in the market for a TV-Tuner card with a hardware MPEG-2 encoder.
Will be using this for MythTV. I earlier had a Pinnacle el-cheapo
tuner card and found it really slow for recording TV and decided to go
with a hardware based encoder this time around.

Was wondering if anyone has managed to buy the WinTV-PVR series of
cards India ? The manufacturer is Hauppauge[1] and here is a list of
the products[2].

The market seems to be flooded with the "el-cheapo-sans-mpeg-encoder"
ones and all online references w.r.t these card's availability in
India are disappointing.

Hi,

        I think zsh has the best of both worlds in this:
__> rm -rf *
zsh: sure you want to delete all the files in /tmp? (waiting ten seconds)
 [yn]? n
__> rm -rf foo*
__>

        So, it makes you wait for 10 seconds if you do rm -rf *, so no
 knee jerk responses are likely to make it through, but rm -rf of a
 smaller set (where you are likely to have considered what you are
 deleting) just go through.

        manoj

 RM_STAR_SILENT (-H) <K> <S>
        Do not query the user before executing ?rm *? or ?rm path/*?.

 RM_STAR_WAIT
        If querying the user before executing ?rm  *?  or  ?rm  path/*?,
        first  wait  ten seconds and ignore anything typed in that time.
        This avoids the problem of reflexively answering  ?yes?  to  the
        query  when  one  didn?t really mean it.  The wait and query can
        always be avoided by expanding the ?*? in ZLE (with tab).

Hi,

as of this week entilre sun java stack is down loadable for Ubntu --
starting with feisty-with just an apt-get

I  do under stand that  sun stack was not the way to go earlier-- but with
this -- surely other linux implementations will follow?

i am not trying to  flame or some thing but i am really not good in this
aspect -- so if there is some thing that iam missing . specially since you
mention that  a make file for he identical binary that sun ships is not to
be available - is ubuntu  being available with this  aolution to the
predicament you mentioned  -- if not  how so ?


Regards
Raj

Strictly speaking, this deal is about Collabnet buying a proprietary
software product and doesn't have much to do with open source as such.
VA retains control of Sourceforge, correct ? The LWN coverage has an
interesting link to the history of Sourceforge fork.

Unlikely. Distributions which only want to include Free and open source 
software won't include the Sun stack unless it is free of proprietary 
encumbrances. Sun Java is not completely under a GPl+ Classpath 
exception license yet.

That particular distribution is merely including binaries with 
proprietary parts that a vendor provides without the complete source 
code under a Free and open source license. That isn't a solution for 
everyone.

I think Pixelview has a card with a hardware-encoder. Check out with
some dealer. I should be able to find the model number for you if your
dealer cant help you.

'kosher'?

There is a simple rule from the wise people - Ask Google before asking
in a mailing list.

Google --> "ls and du showing different file size"

Message-ID: <1177640456.7789.17.camel@Appu>

Hi,

I am having trouble configuring Beryl on Feisty Fawn.  Everything seems
to be
working ok with beryl execpt for windows decorations. The themes do not
seem to be getting applied to the window decorations and also the close,
minimize and maximize buttons are missing on the window.  The problem
exists when I choose beryl / compiz window manager.

I also found from Beryl forums that others have faced with the same
problem (http://forum.beryl-project.org/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=5947) but
no solution to the problem.  

I use NVIDIA Go 7300 graphics card.  Is the problem due to some beryl
settings or is it a problem with the nvdia driver?  Any pointers are
welcome.

Kmail rocks. But it has some limitations.
Thunderbird is only a mail client, no to-do list, no calender, no 
appointments etc.
Evolution has more but i feel it is heavyweighted.
We use KDE and dont like to load a GNOME app as it takes more memory.



Which app you use?
Any addons to Thunderbird to make it full with todo, calender etc.?

Thanks,
T.Shrinivasan.

Did you try only Kmail or tried Kontact also ? Kontact is supposed to 
the PIM which uses Kmail for mail.

For Thunderbird try Lightning 
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/ for calendaring. 
Remember it is still very early code and may not be suitable for production.

Thunderbird is not so userfriendly as kontact.

Try Thunderbird 2.0 with Lightning 0.5 (nightly).  I've been using it 
and I'm really happy with it.

It has vCalendar support, and can send invitations for events as well.

I would recommend you to try out the latest builds, since you get new 
features and also can report bugs/send patches if something doesn't work ;)

That's news for me and I'm unaware of the accuracy.

I meant the Sourceforge is now moving to different hands. The reason
for me sharing this information is, more companies are showing
interest to adopt or encourage open source community. Obviously they
have commercial reasons for do this and it is one of the marketing
tactic to advertise their product.

For instance, Canonical is improving its launchpad community web site
tremendously. They do their own version control system, issue tracker,
polling system and many other components integrated in the web site.
If we closely watch the improvement, we get a feel that their
intention is to make it as a product for commercial reasons.

KDE's Kontact seems to be the most feature complete. However, what
'groupware server' are you going to use?

VA Linux had a product called Sourceforge Enterprise Edition which is 
J2EE based proprietary product that CollabNet has brought. This does not 
affect the Sourceforge.net website. There is no public news of that 
being brought. Have you heard of anything to the contrary?

CollabNet buying a proprietary product does not by itself show any 
adoption of open source software.

Not necessarily. It can just function as a proprietary web service with 
commercial gains.

Oops..there was another part in the programming which was creating problems

You cannot "always create the file" as the file could exist already...
Three solutions if the file already exists:

1. Truncate the file: Use "w"
2. Append to the file: Use "w+"
3. Return with the error: Not sure how to do this with fopen. But the
UNIX open with flags O_CREAT and O_EXCL will serve the purpose.

it moves on..

I think this can be the easiest way :D,

if os.path.isfile(str_file_name) == False:
                outfile=open(str_file_name,"w")

Check for the file existence before writing it to , so if its there already,
dont write. And yes, it depends on the necessity.

This is insecure, as it has a race condition... Make sure the race
condition doesn't affect the program.

How? A company buying a proprietary product from another company has no 
impact on the open source community.

Kontact is good.
But, It is not showing the images in the mails properly.
It shows the images in the bootom of the message seperately.

Then, It is not connecting with the exchange server.

The sourceforge.net could be a proprietary product, but as everyone
knows, it's an open source community. The community is heavily
dependent on the company/entity who is hosting that community. If it
is moving to different hands, they may still keep going. In addition,
they may improve the service much better and make it a wonderful place
to host open source projects. On the other hand, they may also
shutdown the service, if they have justifiable reasons, in which case,
the community may move to different hosting service provider. Anyway,
it is just my opinion.

You seem to be again confusing the product with the website. The product 
was brought. The website hasn't changed hands. Buying the product has no 
change on the website and thus does not affect the community.

Maybe a analogy would help. Microsoft Office is a product. Google Office 
(non enterprise edition) is a web service. That's the difference.

Message-ID: <69621d830704271117o2ddc8d0ewd735c1441e65a832@mail.gmail.com>

I have to make a process scheduler in linux. The specification is something
like this:

The input will be taken from file. The input format is as follows:

No of processes(N)
arrival time cpuBurst IOBurst..........0.
.
.
.
(N such entries)


The output will be in the following format:
cpuUtilization
Throughput
Waiting time turnaround time
.
.
.
(N such entries)

How can make it possible?

Let me get this correct. Have you been asked to write a scheduler for
linux (wow!) ? Or have you been asked to run some processes and do
accounting of the resources they used and their performance ?

If the later, you might use the /proc/<pid>/ to gather stats for the process.
man proc. You might as well use the various system calls to gather this
information. From what i can think of now, you might write a program
with fork() in it, so that the parent process can do the accounting, and
the child process can exec() the Nth intended process (out of your N
processes). The parent process can always monitor, because it knows
the pid of the child. (I am having strace in my mind - like it tells you
all the system calls your process makes).

If you want to set the scheduling policy for your process, you can use
sched_setscheduler(). man for it. The man page will show you other
useful function calls at the bottom.  Note: I have read about it, have
not used it.

Now after all this - i believe you might already have tools to do the
above :)) But its good to write your own program and understand stuff.

Sure there is. The traditional norms of Free software have never 
involved web services and none of the licenses (except for Affero GPL) 
treat web services as a form of distribution.

There is a take at http://log.ometer.com/2006-07.html#29 on the impact. 
The latest GPL v3 draft at 
http://gplv3.fsf.org/gpl-draft-2007-03-28.html includes a compatibility 
provision with (yet to be released) Affero GPLv2. This along with the 
related rationale document explaining the changes shows that there is 
indeed a difference between a web service and a product.

Qhwn you formatted the Suse partition, the boot loader was still GRUB.
Thus, it could not find the image to boot the OS and hence the error.

This is a bit confusing, when the Kubuntu installed where did the
Ubuntu 6.10 come from ? You said you have removed the Suse and the
GRUB should have got reinstalled now. So, it should point to the
current Kubutu installation. If not, you can manually edit GRUB's
menu.list to point to your Kubuntu installation.

Kubuntu = Ubuntu with KDE. You can have KDE (kubuntu-desktop) in
Ubuntu or Ubuntu (ubuntu-desktop) in Kubuntu installations. You want
KDE with Ubuntu or a seperate Kubuntu installation along with Ubuntu ?

boot the PC with the Ubuntu Live CD..

go to terminal..

$ sudo grub

it will take it the grub prompt,

gives you locations..(if more than one)

chose the location where grub need to be installed..

then give,

then to install grub,

Finall to quit,

Reboot the PC...:-)

It is possible.. I do have like that.. The grub boot loader (am not sure or
the debian installer)  which writes to the /boot/grub/menu.lst has some
problems in Ubuntu.

When one have a distro of Ubuntu already and tries to install another in
some other partition it creates more entries in this menu.lst

u can manually edit them and customize..

It is this menu.lst entriy that appears while we boot our PC... Check there
for your installations...

Hope this give some idea.. it helped me some time back :-)

would have been installed there... b4...

In the GRUB screen, press `e' to edit the kernel line, and add an `S'
to the end of the line, press enter and then `b' to boot. That should
take you to single user mode, and you can reconfigure xserver-xorg or
manually edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf and go to the ordinary runlevel
using init 2.

HTH.

Message-ID: <69621d830704280920x42648dc5ufe9b986482752923@mail.gmail.com>

My graphics card is Nvidia Geforce 2 MX400. I tried to install the driver
named "NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-7185-pkg1.run". Before that i tried to install
the kernel source of my Etch system kernel. But, i didn`t find any
kernel-source in my package.

Anyway, i installed the kernel-header and tried to install
NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1....
But i failed.

I installed nvidia driver in Sarge. By this way:

1. installed kernel-source
2. installed kernel-headers
3. init 1

Why not try the deb packages in Debian non-free repositories. I am sure 
they have the latest driver for the old card you are having.

instead of editing xorg.conf you could just run

The Java 7 JVM and compiler are already developed under GPL as OpenJDK. 
These can be used to bootstrap the GNU Classpath Libraries. The Sun JDK 
Class libraries are not under GPL yet.

Sun said it would put Java class libraries under GPL except for code 
licensed from other companies by March. On reading Classpath developer 
blogs and Javalobby forums it seems the process will be completed in 
around a month. Even then there might be parts missing which would 
require reimplementation.

None of the ditros currently package the GPL portions of the Sun Java 
stack. They all seem to be waiting for the libraries to come under GPL. 
The Ubuntu packages in multiverse are repackaged JDK from the sun 
website and are distributed by Ubuntu under the old Java Distributor 
License.

Senthil

interesting, so I am not the only person who's heard of this - gpl'd 
java end to end, within the life of java-7..

We've been in touch with Sun on this issue ( we = centos ). And there 
are a few legal grey areas as well, including the issue of assumed 
liability which is a major factor in business grade platforms. And no 
one really wants to take on that task.

We had a look at those as well - Sun was pushing it really hard, but 
again it was legal and not technical issues that prevented it from going 
out ( dev.centos.org actually did get some testing rpms as well )

While I can ssh just fine to ::1

Stop the torrent. Find a rsync mirror and rsync it.

Are there no seeds for the torrent? Then downloading it from another
place is the only solution. Or if you think its a problem with
Ktorrent, try opening the torrent with another client and point the
"save to" location to where Ktorrent had saved it. Most bittorrent
clients can continue on a torrent saved by another client (I've tried
that with Azureus and uTorrent).

Are you sure this isn't one of those weird 32-bit file access
problems? The number 4.2 GB sounds familiar :)

Just to confirm, which filesystem does the disk you are downloading to
use? I had a very similar problem using a FAT disk, wherein wget would
crash and dump core.

Hi,

The Kubuntu Server for download had been inactive in-between.. Even I was
downloading the DVD and it stopped in between but using Ubuntu.

http://torrent.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/feisty/release/dvd/ is this the
URL from where you are trying to download?

That reminds, what's the status of the tracker? That might give you some clue.

I hope the Etch DVD you have everything within.
So comment all the external links in the source.list file.
Put only the entry for DVD.

Then give apt-get update.

Now install whatever you need from the DVD itself.

In addition to the steps/workaround provided by Shrini, please see if
the following document is useful for you. This document is specific to
Ubuntu 6.10, but I'm guessing you should find it useful for Debian
Etch as well. Good luck!
