        Can't you simply do apt-get install apache2 ? It has mod_ssl
by default, IIRC.

        OpenSSL is installed by default. I guess we have to install
libssl and/or libcrypto dev libraries for ssl based programs.

I am installing from Ubuntu mini OS so it is a stripped down version so we
need to manually install just what we require inside it.  I tried
installing dev package with "apt-get install libssl-dev" still the same
result.

Dear Madan

Kind request , do not top post, consider interleaved posting style.

>>   Excellent arguments and counter arugment, but can we spend our energy
on the open source cause here on ilugc - any such arguments could be taken
up in a 1:1 email.

I guess this is not a private query which i raised!. I am asking for
"equal opportunity" to compete with the cartel formation by some members of
ilugc.
Further the mailing list "trainers" clause is stripped from the guidelines,
as a trainer I want it and hence i am asking about that clause.

regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Thats fair, can you start a new thread to discuss that? Maybe you can help
lead our efforts there?

     I object to the use of the term "cartel" here. It was explicitly
mentioned that we are contacting HoD, CS at DG Vaishnav college. A
"cartel" would never do that. No one in ilugc said,
"As a member of ilugc, you cannot conduct training for people who have
approached ilugc".

Only when such a scenario occurs, you can call it anti-competitive.
People have been asking you to reach out to the HoD, and talk about
your training. You said you do training as a job. Then, I don't
understand the reluctance on your part to reach out to the people
concerned.

I agree that we need to put the clause back. But again, if people want
the training from ilugc, I don't think many people in ilugc would
object to that either. So, we need a slightly modified clause than
what it used to be. Thanks

I would like to add that in my interactions with Thyagarajan, he comes across as being very opinionated and self-centred. These are not good traits in a community.

If Thyagarajan wants to compete with ilugc, nobody is stopping him from doing so. All the contact details are given and he can get in touch with the users directly if his ideologu differs from ilugc.

Hi Bala,

Thanks for your reply..

now coming to the word 'cartel'.

Cartel
"Noun: An association of manufacturers or suppliers that maintains
prices at a high level and restricts competition".

If a programme is conducted say for 60 hours , I charge X amount.
This may be high or low to that of professional charges what ilugc charges.
If I go with ilugc, I have to take a slice of a cake.
so the word 'cartel' is used in that sense .

>>"As a member of ilugc, you cannot conduct training for people who have
approached ilugc".

I do not understand how this is not possible.
I was asked by ilugc to do a training programme in Bhubaneswar Odissa
India which i did it.
To work in chennai, do any local permit needed ?

>>I don't understand the reluctance on your part to reach out to the people
concerned.

On health grounds I am struck. Any way, will try to reach them out.
Just passing a email will be a courteous one.
In pursuit of a job, I thought ilugc will be helpful for people who
are ready to do the job in their own terms, for me it appears
otherwise.

>>I agree that we need to put the clause back. But again, if people want
the training from ilugc, I don't think many people in ilugc would
object to that either. So, we need a slightly modified clause than
what it used to be

Personally I am not against this training programme, I am against the
manner in which it is operated. Giving the email id to the list helps
many people to seize the opportunity..
My plea would be, "please open the gates ;) for all ".

In life, we win some and lose some.
All that matters is the delivery of work.
I believe I am better when I am on my own.

Cheers,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Shri Baskar Selvaraj suggested booting to Level 3.

What were the result.

Also ensure that gpm service is running -- for checking mouse in CUI.

The run level 3 also did not help me in making both the input devices functional and I am keeping my fingers crossed as to huv to proceed further?

K.We will take a close look into this problem.,

 Go to single user mode and modify the line

id:5:initdefault:

into

 id:3:initdefault:

and boot the machine normal.Now your X wont start.

Login as root user and check udev is started or not.

  Ok. I get what you meant. But the term as such, has a lot of
negative connotation.

   Gmail introduced a line break and misquoted my sentence. I meant to
say, if ilugc does something restrictive, that is bad. But here, no
one says you shouldn't do the training. So, ilugc is not being
anti-competitive.

     Sorry about you being stuck on health grounds. But as Raman
pointed out, in this case, the institute had wanted it to be under the
banner of ilugc. May be, we could make that appoint up front when ever
that is the case.

    It would help genuine people to pursue it. But it also gives an
opportunity for the "criminal elements" to exploit the person whose
identity has bee shared :( There is no way we can ascertain that some
person X(I am not talking about you. You have been around for a long
time here, but others ?) is genuinely interested in promoting free
software, and help people by training them. Thanks

Hi

the udev service appears to be running as I could observe the display of "udev service is starting OK" in boot message when I boot the m/c. in run level 1

<quote from my mail in the same thread>
No harm in being "open" by sharing the details.
But, then more people will be contacting the college in the name of ILUGC,
even without the knowledge of any of us.

How can we prevent this?

I dont want some X to use the name of ILUGC to make their business,
without our knowledge.
</quote from my mail in the same thread>


If the college wants to have a training on PHP and Python from a
training center, they could have posted an advertisement in any media
like newspapers, mailing lists etc.

Then they might have got many proposals for a fair competition.
They would be ended with a confusion on whom to choose.
Conducting interview for all the trainers to choose a better one is impossible.

That's where the HOD believes ILUGC.
He believe that we have some proved great trainers in our list, who
have real time experience in the field.

He wants do to training programs JOINTLY WITH ILUGC.
So that the problem of finding the good trainer will be solved.
And that's why I posted the request for trainers here.

The fun part is, I got mails from 4 training centers, that are very new to me.
They got the mail forwarded by multiple times and approached me.
Even one is from banglore.

I dont know how to evaluate them and refer to the college.

Fortunately, I got reply from Asokan, for Python training.

Waiting for a trainer from ILUGC for the LAMP training.
If no one comes up, we may ending with choosing a commercial training center.


If I am too open and share the contact details in the public list, it
will lead to

1. more proposals from completely unknown people
2. confusion in choosing the trainers
3. problems in organising the sessions for ILUGC with those new people.
4. Choosing not good trainer will endup with bad name for ILUGC.

Though these all may not happen, chances are there to happen.

Dear Thyagarajan,
If you wish to join with ILUGC in this training program for LAMP,
please reply here with your interest. So far, you did not replied here
on your interest in training on PHP or Python.

If you want to do a separate programs, you are always welcome to reach
the HOD in person. We are not the marketing people for individual
trainers.

Let us stop the discussion here.

For want of a Rs. 1000/year, you are willing to go through hoops.
IMO, it is better to get it hosted if the company is unwilling to
shell out that kind of money to run a "public facing" SMTP server.

Sorry, I am a private lancing trainer . Not an institute.
The best way to help him out is , give the details to many and help him in
his process.
The HOD is a techie , he knows how to weigh things , he asked me to present
a sample class which i agreed upon.

regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Dear Sir, there has been some confusion in the lugc group as to whether
individuals can conduct classes in your college in their private capacity
(not as part of lugc). I'm herewith adding you back to the thread so that
others in the thread can respond. Pl. do add your thoughts too. We are an
open group and would love to hear your thoughts on organizing these classes.

Mr. Thyagarajan : Can you pl. respond to Mr. Santhanam's query.

Nevertheless, it presumably has the Debian package management tools.
You can install the apache2 deb package rather than compiling from
source as mentioned by Balachandran Sivakumar.

Any particular reason for compiling it from source?

Also suggest try version 12.04.1, it fixed installation of 3rd party
repos like Zentyal.

I don't have any particular reason,  I want apache running with SSL on port
443 and make PHP work along with it.  I am following this link to do the
same,  If there is any other better link do pass it along.

Are all of the 2GB DDL statements?

Is it possible to filter out the DDL statements

It beats me as to why one would need DML and a huge amount of data to
figure out schema.

Hi Madan and HOD sir

>>.Dear Sir, there has been some confusion in the lugc group as to whether
individuals can conduct classes in your college in their private capacity
(not as part of lugc). I'm herewith adding you back to the thread so that
others in the thread can respond. Pl. do add your thoughts too. We are an
open group and would love to hear your thoughts on organizing these classes.

I am struggling to understand what the mail means.
Since I have not got the copy of Prof T Sudaram's mail.

However I would like to add few thoughts.

I have approached Prof.Santhanam at DG Vaishnava Chennai.
Conducting workshop , honestly I believe this It is my job.

I have done such exercises
some snaps at: http://openvidya.fossfactory.in/workshops

To me openvidya is my identity, if my client wants 'thyagarajan' and not

If Prof.Santham is okay with me, I am open in working with Prof.Santham .

[Personal Opinion]
Unfortunate that such a large college wants free beer. In the spirit of
"increasing employment opportunity" I think they should choose a commercial
provider who is making money with/through open source products and
services.

While the post is good, it is not necessary for your case.

Most distros build apache with SSL support.  You just need to enable
the SSL module.  In Debian and Ubuntu "man a2enmod" is what you need.

IMO as a standard practice,you should look under /etc/ for the
configuration files for the package you are working with.  Debian (and
derived distros) package manager are quite painstaking in making their
packages easy to configure (albeit from the CLI).  (dpkg -L <pkg name>
for file/util listings etc.)

This is not free beer. The trainers will be paid by the college.
Many colleges had bad experience with many commercial entities.
This professor has some keen interest in promoting FOSS. Almost all the CS students are already trained in basic Linux. He also made his students to contribute to spoken tutorials project.

He has offered us place and facilities for any event that ILUGC will be hosting including monthly meetings.

I am afraid by needless discussions we have reduced our standings in his view.

Subject: [Ilugc] Help regarding resizing /boot Partition
Message-ID: <CACm7z1YngjvpiqdEzWGR6MeAtZqMXsMJxv29d_HNpHOgMAUv9g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have 320gb hdd, and have separate partitions for /, /boot and /home.

Using Fedora 16, I have created the /boot partition with size of 100mb
initially thought, it would be enough to handle it. But the problem arose
when I tried to update using yum update.

It said /boot partition become full at the midst of the update and the
update could not be completed. So now I have to resize the /boot partition.

I have got 200mb freespace and I wanted to merge it with /boot partition
in-order to extend the size of the /boot.

I wanted to know how to increase the size of /boot with the available 200mb
free space.

Screenshot link:- http://i.imgur.com/02Isu.png

Note:- Using gparted and trying to resize the /boot doesn't show the extra
200mb freespace to extend.

Guide me, how can I achieve it.

Do I need to delete the /boot and merge it with freespace and then create
/boot again? If so, how to create /boot again?

I also googled but could not find simple explanation for it.

Execute the entire file in an MySQL engine (thats mysql server). Now
truncate data in all tables and then take backup of your schema. That will
be ur DDL ;-)

Don't Panic

/boot is supposed to contain files related to booting the system.
Therefore files that reside in it are are the linux kernel, initrd
ramdisk and grub files.

I fail to understand what do you have there to occupy 85MB!    My
/boot is about 32MB with the above files + extlinux boot loader as
well.   I have only kernel though.

Are you updating the kernel for your Fedora setup?  Otherwise, it has
no business complaining about disk space in /boot.

Please look at your own screenshot.   The free space is @ the end of
the disk and *not* alongside your boot partition.  Filesystems
*cannot* span non contiguous space on the disk;  file systems on
logical volumes (LVM) being an exception.

On second looks @ the screen shot, where is the extended partition
that holds sda5 and sda6?   Going by the PC style (DOS) partitioning
scheme, one of the sda1, sda2, sda3, sda4 should be an "extended"
partition but your screenshot does *not* show it.

In gparted, the extended partition shows up with a light blue border,
containing the logical partitions within it.

For your benefit, I partitioned a 50G virtual disk in LKVM, to
illustrate what a traditional PC (DOS) partitioning looks like in
gparted.

See the gparted screen shot of the 50GB virtual disk -
http://imagebin.org/230597.

It shows sda4 as extended with logical partitions contained within and
the free space.

What tool did you use to partition the hard disk?

Your best bet would be to merge /boot with /, change the grub settings
and update MBR.  I personally do not see any point for a separate
/boot partition for a desktop setup.

Sometimes the answer is in front of us but we cannot see it :)  It
happens to all of us.

Hi Prasanna,

You only merge free space with a partition that is nearby. If there are
partitions in between they cannot be merged. The 200Mb free space must be
next to the /boot partition.

Make sure you allot some more space for /boot (you may need it in future
while installing multiple distros etc). You cannot resize a mounted
partition I guess so use a live CD to resize /boot partition.

Hope this helps,
PrasannaKumar

Concur 100%. Unnecessarily bringing him into the loop ( on something which
should have been a pvt conv among affected parties in the first place),
does not show ILUGC in good light.

Read the .sql dump file properly.   It should have statements to
create tables and define fields within them.   It will also have
statements to "insert" data into those tables/fields (some of them can
be default).   These 'insert' statements are a NOP for you.

You can filter out create sql statements since you are only interested
in the db schema, into another file and you will notice that the new
file is much smaller than your 2GB SQL dump.

I suggest that you brush up on SQL basics (I am not a DBA).

This was never mentioned anywhere in the thread. As a person who was
following the thread, I assumed the entire circus was about someone wanting
to do this at a cost (to make his living) vs. a bunch of people who wanted
to do this free.

This is so sad. We need better commercial entities who are involved with
FOSS then. If I were a decision maker, I would choose a commercial entity
because:

   - I have commercial/legal binding on the delivery of training
   - Can question quality of training
   - Can demand what I want and not accept what is being offered.
   - Plan my courses and classes based on my time, and not based on the
   trainer's full time employer's.

I agree my comment on free beer was not warranted, but as mentioned
earlier, the fact that money was involved for trainers was never mentioned
anywhere.

@Raman, my post was not directed against any one. I am awed by the efforts
put in by you and a few others in promoting FOSS. Specifically people like
you who have put in years. I still remember meeting you over a decade ago
in one of the ILUGC meetings at IIT.

When money is involved, it is better to be clear and transparent.

Arun

I have been watching this thread for quite some time. This should have 
been managed in professional way. The moderators could have dealt this 
with certain level of maturity. I wish our KG should be here to see all 
this. He would have sorted  this out with a single mail.I feel bad by 
seeing even experienced people have down to argue on this topic. I think 
we have silent observers who is looking this group to  get knowledge. 
such  topics  will lower the dignity  and a wrong message  convey to 
those users.
its my humble openion.  I hope my comment will not start another thread mail

KG used the iron hand against repeated top posting in particular.
Kindly follow the mailing list guidelines and avoid top posting.
Interleaved, trimmed posting style is the recommended one. Hope this
doesn't go to /dev/null as it usually does whenever people point out
such things to you.

I have never used itrans. I just compared Phonetic and Tamil99.
Difficulty is not the matter what I meant.

For writing in phonetic methods, we have to convert them into English
format and then get what we want!! We are typing only as Tanglish.
In my view,

For instance, to write, ????? ????? ?????????
We are first converting it to
????? ????? ????????? --> nii~Nga tamiz pesupavaraa ? (itrans) OR wEngka
thamiz pEsupavarA? (phonetic)
Typing that and getting the output.

Thus, we are forced to convert in Tanglish and write...

Why should we use the help of another language to write and express what we
desired to express in our own language???

Transliteration methods are OK for freshers.. But, is it good for regular
users ? Definitely NO...

This one is for Oracle. Tailor it to your needs. May be one or two

If any of the FLOSS accounting packages can have it as a plugin

Thanks for responding.

I am interested in joining forces.

Shall we start a thread having an open review of say accounting
standards and the way CAs and authorities look at the whole thing?

I am not a commerce or accounting professional by any standards. But I
do know a bit or two about technology.

To begin with let us start deciphering this entire accounting business
in technical terms.

Let us not for a minute forget that ICAI is money minded...

While doing the above, remove the existing /boot filesystem entry from

To: mailinglist at fsftn.org



Hey all,

I would like to introduce you to Project NeMo [1]- (short for News
Mozilla). This is a community project led by Communication Reps of
Mozilla in association with Mozilla PR.

Over the years, there has been a tremendous scope for Open Source and
web technologies. But, all the knowledge and the know how of that has
been restricted only to the so called 'netizens' albeit several
efforts and promotions. A common man or a regular internet user does
not know much about all that's happening around. We believe, that a
significant population still relies on the newspaper and other forms
of the print media for hobby, passion and information and that its the
best way to reach them - across all ages and people's interests.

And so, in that regard, this project, NeMo aims at creating short
articles on various topics concerning common web technologies - like "
why and how css works ? Do we need Javascript at all, how is it
helpful, What is PHP and HTML5? " and about Open Source Software too.
The articles are written in about 300-400 words in a manner that can
be understood by all - from a student, working professional to the
Grandpa down the street - perfectly suited for print media to reach
all.

All the articles are being localized into various languages as well,
thus providing opportunity for a wider reach. Check for sample
articles here. [2]

Sounds interesting ? You may contribute to - Content Generation - to
write articles or for Localization - translating purposes.[3] Sign up
here. [4] Subscribe to the mailing list and say "Hi !" [5].

Thanks,
Dwaraka

<quote>
A computer scientist has come up with a proposal to replace
cryptography's Alice and Bob with characters from Hindu mythology.

For decades, techniques to encrypt and decrypt communications have
been explained using two imaginary characters, Alice and Bob, and
potential eavesdropper Eve. Alice sends a message to Bob, and Eve is
always trying to intercept it - the little sneak. Alice and Bob first
came to light in 1978 in a groundbreaking paper [PDF] on the RSA
algorithm for public-key cryptography.

Dr S. Parthasarathy, a part-time lecturer and full-time employee of
Indian biz Algologic Research & Solutions, suggests a cast change in
the dramatis personae of cryptography with Sita and Rama, two central
characters in the Hindu mythological epic Ramayana. The proposed
sacking-and-hiring also replaces Eve with Ravana the rogue, as the
doctor explains.

Indeed, its funny..

The placed proposal could create a confusion with modern technology and old
Hindu Mythology. If not thought properly there might even come a situation
where the students would actually believe such mechanism such as
deffie-helman was there in ancient India.

Alice and bob, is portrayed to the students as 2 random people of everyday
life who's name has nothing special and can't be confused easily. Some
random Indian name would have been more appropriate, than using
Ram/Sita/Ravan

*this is my view only

I didn't mean anything disrespectful, but a name that has no special
significance would be the best and would avoid confusion. ( of course this
confusion arises only in the chance if it not thought properly, or if this
example is mentioned to school children )

Thanks to all those who responded with suggestions.

Unfortunately, after a week of several tries, the suggested tools were
unable to recover anything intelligible.

I sent the disk to a "data recovery service."   They kept the disk for
about 12 days trying their software based tools and were not meeting
with much success.   When I told them to return the disk back, they
asked for 2 more days; apparently they a few more "ace" tools in their
toolbox.  A couple of days later I got a call that they had been able
to recover 560GB of data.   From what they reported it ran for a long
time (they would not disclose the exact duration).

When I visited their lab to verify the recovered data, the disk was
connected to a "special" card [1] running on a Windows 7 desktop.   I
guess the hardware/software combo went down to the sector level and
re-assembled the files.   Pretty much all the files (from what I could
recall) were there.    I got the files back on a NTFS formatted disk.
The cost was Rs. 12K.

[1] The only thing the lab technician was ready to disclose - that the
hardware had been imported card at considerable cost (Rs. 5 lacs) and
it came only with Windows drivers.

Lesson learnt:   Tread with extreme caution when you are using disk
and filesystem utility tools like dd, dd_rescue, fdisk, mkfs etc.
Review and confirm the "target" location *before* hitting the return
key!

   This might actually help them understand better. It is the
responsibility of the teacher to explain that this is just an
example/analogy :) Actually, there is nothing wrong in explaining a
technology using stories/epics that are easy for us to understand as
an analogy. Most students know the story and can relate to it well,
and understand concepts like "man-in-the-middle", "secure channel" etc
easily than if we use some hypothetical, slightly more difficult to
imagine examples. Thanks

Dear all,

          I have the cloud server in rackspace with ubuntu 11.04 and there
i configure the mail server (postfix+roundcube).Now i receive the mail from
rackspace regarding my server was accessing caltech.edu without permission.
And they send the log details like


The Corresponding server was observed probing caltech.edu for security holes. It
has been blocked at our border routers.

And i login to my cloud server through ssh and i check the "nmap
localhost" there i got some error and i could not get the port and
respective service. I made the software update and reboot the
machine it was working fine.

 But i want to know the " issue about caltech was there, or what was
the nature of that problem" then only i can manage the issue.

Your machine has most likely been compromised/r00ted by some worm and is now
looking for other machines to infect. (The other possiblity is you have some
kind of open proxy configured on your server and it is being exploited to
scan other machines).

The nmap run is absolutely useless since the worm/scanner won't be listening
on "localhost'.

Running software updates after you've been compromised is not useful either.

Try running "lsof -n |grep TCP" and see if you find anything suspicious,
chances are there will be a rootkit installed which would hide the process
from you.

>  But i want to know the " issue about caltech was there, or what was the

Also look at the output of "last -a" and see if you find any logins from any
IP/IPs other than yours.

If you don't have anything critical running on the server you are probably
better off just re-imaging it and using more secure passwords or switch to
keybased auth.

This is probably the account that was used to compromise the machine.

h1913085.stratoserver.net has address 85.214.64.43

inetnum:        85.214.16.0 - 85.214.139.255
netname:        STRATO-RZG-DED2
descr:          Strato Rechenzentrum, Berlin
country:        DE

I guess you had a weak password for the account like test/testing or test4.

Hi

The m/c. in trouble is running as a trial server for our organisation's library repository on CENTOS 6 and it is supposed to be transformed into regular production server on IBM X server with the same CENTOS 6. As I have been unable to find solution to the present issue, I am quite reluctant to go ahead with the CENTOS for regular production service. Hence, I wish to seek epxerts opinion in this regard from this forum. 

with thanx

'pwgen' is a handy tool to generate random passwords (default 8
chars).  Pick one that you feel you can remember.   Give sudo access

You may know the wc command for word count, line count and character count.

But inside vim you can just press, 'g Ctrl-g' for word count.

It is a nice feature I sometimes use.

Join the FSF and friends in updating the Free Software Directory
>From September 21st:

Tens of thousands of people visit directory.fsf.org each month to
discover free software. Each entry in the Directory contains a wealth of
useful information, from basic category and descriptions, to providing
detailed info about version control, IRC channels, documentation, and
licensing info that has been carefully checked by FSF staff and trained
volunteers.

While the Free Software Directory has been and continues to be a great
resource to the world over the past decade, it has the potential of
being a resource of even greater value. But it needs your help staying
up to date with new and exciting free software projects.

To help, join volunteer leader Andrew Engelbrecht on most Fridays from
2pm to 5pm EDT (18:00 to 21:00 UTC). Meetings take place in the #fsf
channel on irc.gnu.org, and usually include a handful of regulars as
well as new volunteers. Everyone's welcome.

Quoting Ravana as a rogue is not correct.. He was also a King who had many
capabilities.
What makes people to make a rough statement that he is a rougue?

He committed few evils. Agreed... But, there are many kings and emperors in
this world whom we praise, who had committed the much more evil!!

The above statements are IMO

UPDATE:

I got a Huawei E173 USB modem + BSNL 3G connection.
Works with Ubuntu 12.04 64bit Server after modifying modeswitch rules for
minor device ID.

Getting consistent download speeds of 400 kilo bytes / second.
Upload speed test with wput is showing only 26 kilo bytes / second. But I
suspect it is higher with other apps. Will post after checking this. Any
better way of testing upload speeds from the command line?

       Just an indirect way that I could think of. Doing an scp will
show the speed. If we scp a large file(say 50 MB), we should be able
to get the speed from the progress output. But, I don't know how
reliable that is as a tool to measure speed. Thanks

Your mail can be put in a much more professional manner no?

I mean the formatting, thinking on how to ask and so on.

It is not true that if you have an A record MX is not needed. It may
work due to luck but
 it is better to stick to standards.

Yes, you can point 100 A records to the same IP.

If your MX is not setup properly mail will not come even after 1200 hours. ;)

Check with mxtoolbox.com

       The  formatting looks a little messed up. Probably gmail did
something "intelligently". For the DNS entries, this is how it should
be in bind

mydomain.com    IN    A   ip.addr.ess
                          IN   MX 10 mx.mydomain.com

mx.mydomain.com IN A ip.address.of.mx

Normally, lists will be on the same  box as the mx. So, you need to add

lists.mydomain.com IN CNAME mx.mydomain.com

Having these should work ok for Bind. What DNS server are you running
? Based on that, the syntax would vary. But conceptually, this is how
the entries should be. Thanks



PS: If it is just mailing lists, and you are not very specific about
the domain, you can use freelists -  www.freelists.org

methinks, an IT technical person should be master of at least two
domains: IT and another business vertical. That would be the value

Can you then suggest wherein ilugc members also can participate?

The idea was to provide a public view of genesis of discussions,
exchange of ideas etc. that precedes before even a line of code in
publicly visible archive.

That would have been very useful from the students perspective in the
sense that it would help filling the gap between learninig n the
college and real world.

That would have also helped many other members evaluated at least one
of the "patterns" of evolution of a project.

I would term that as open source.

I do not have the energy to spend on yet another mailing list, git/svn
and the such.

I solicit other members opinion on the matter.

We just had a long philo

Hi

IMO, Alice, Bob, Carol, Eve, Rama, Ravan, Sita are all fictional
characters. In this example, they have been used just for names. And
names don't matter, it can be X,Y or Z. What actually matters is the
way it is taught. Using a simple real-life example using 3 PCs in a
network for demonstrating evesdropping and man in the middle attack
will be much better than using names. Here IP addresses are much more
useful than any other names.

Replacing English names with Indian ones won't make any difference. It
is like replacing 'Hello, World' with 'Vanakkam, Ulagam' - It changes
nothing.

Hi!

My experience with 3G USB Dongles has been this: speed and signal
strength totally depend on the location and weather. And you can
forget about underground floors - they simply stop working.

So I would suggest you to take a kutti survey in your neighbourhood to
find out more about which 3G dongle will be the best for you.

And IMO, if you have a GUI way of doing anything on a GNU/Linux
machine, it can also be done using CLI. And this applies to 3G modems
too.

What is it:

Qt Mplayer front-end, with basic features like playing videos, DVDs,
and VCDs to more advanced features like support for MPlayer filters
and more. One of the most interesting features of SMPlayer: it
remembers the settings of all files you play. So you start to watch a
movie but you have to leave... don't worry, when you open that movie
again it will resume at the same point you left it, and with the same
settings: audio track, subtitles, volume...

I downloaded latest silpa code from
http://smc.org.in/silpa/source.html


I am trying to run as standalone server in GNU/Linux Without
installing\http://smc.org.in/silpa/install.html


To start it, I gave the following.

shrinivasan at shrinivasan-laptop:~/tamil/silpa/silpa-master$ python
src/silpa/__init__.py
Silpa server loading ...
Listening on port : 8080
Silpa is ready!!!


I open it in browser as http://localhost:8080

But when accessing the links, for example
http://localhost:8080/Spellcheck

it throws the error "http://localhost:8080/Spellcheck"

on the console, getting the error as below

Please suggest a command line tool that will do it from a server  (of
course no GUI) to the next hop which would be the ISP's gateway
address (in this case the other end of the 3G connection).

Thanks for sharing your progress.  It is very helpful.

To the best of my knowledge the network stack will take up all the b/w
that is available, I do not think it is app dependent.

The weakest "link" is between the IP you get and the ISP gateway.
The best alternative is a "speed test" page hosted by your ISP.

A quick search for "BSNL speed test" throws up the following:
<http://bsnlspeedtest.in/>
but it does only download speed.

You can hookup up the 3G dongle to a laptop (assuming your browser
support java/flash etc.) and get an idea about the speed between "you"
and the BSNL end.

Speedtest.net (with the closest server  to your location) is a fairly
accurate picture for both download and upload speeds but the utility
is flash based.

This is the best way to get things done i.e. look for pre built
packages for the distribution.

The exception being when there are problems with the pre built
packages or they do not support certain feature(s) that are an
absolute must for you.  But then be prepared for dependency hell
(potentially).

No.There is no need to create new section.Already there will be a section as

ServerFlags .Add it in the section.I asked to post your xorg.conf.

The advertised speeds for 3G (or any shared wireless link GPRS/EDGE/EVDO/LTE
etc.) is the theoretical maximum. You'll rarely(read never) achieve those
speeds in the real world.

Also the speeds are the maximum speed "per tower" not "per user". So in
densely populated areas with lots of active users, your speeds can quite
easily drop to worse than dialup, or even prevent you from getting on the
network if the tower already has the maximum number of users.(Happens
regularly at concerts/rallies and other crowded places.)

So any speed test you do run today are absolutely meaningless tomorrow when
the operator has added more subscribers.

I was quiet sucessful, but it was before, pinguino released the new version
which supports both 32 and 8 bit.
I used sdcc and arduino like language, to generate binary for 8051. Tried
only digital IO, and it worked.

I followed this entire thread (26/Sep to 3/Oct) on the gmane archive
and noticed the OP mention that this is a "trial" server.  Perhaps the
OS can be thrashed and the OP can start a fresh installation.  (You
may want to keep a back up image of the OS for analysis offline)

If this is the case, then I would strongly suggest to OP to do a fresh
install of CentOS 6.3 (the latest incarnate of CentOS 6) rather than
fighting this problem on CentOS 6.0.   Time is of essence and there
comes a point when a fresh install is a faster solution.  Don't forget
to back up your data though.

AFAIK, very few actually put CentOS 6.0 into production (see CentOS
General mailing list archive).    CentOS 6 gained traction when 6.1
release came out.

I followed this entire thread (26/Sep to 3/Oct) on the gmane archive
and noticed the OP mention that this is a "trial" server.  Perhaps the
OS can be thrashed and the OP can start a fresh installation.  (You
may want to keep a back up image of the OS for analysis offline)

If this is the case, then I would strongly suggest to OP to do a fresh
install of CentOS 6.3 (the latest incarnate of CentOS 6) rather than
fighting this problem on CentOS 6.0.   Time is of essence and there
comes a point when a fresh install is a faster solution.  Don't forget
to back up your data though.

AFAIK, very few actually put CentOS 6.0 into production (see CentOS
General mailing list archive).    CentOS 6 gained traction when 6.1
release came out.

Dear Mr. Arun

I am in appreciative of your suggestion and proposal. However, the concern is that if the centos produce such undesirable results within one month during its trial period then What would be its consequences on production server? In fact, it has been put under observation for one month to study its function and charactersistics. Erasing and resinstalling can be done without wasting time but what is the solution to existing malfunction? It is a case study whose end result could become beacon light for those who encounter such secnario in future. But unfortunaetely, the solution is becoming elusive to our effort.

I have a few CentOS 5.x server installation (no X windows) in
production that are humming along :)

With ref. to CentOS 6.0:
No matter how well a release is tested through it's beta and release
candidate program, it is not possible to  encompass the entire gamut
of hardware that a released product may face.

Typically, the first version of a major release of any software,
especially a general purpose OS, is likely to have some unresolved
issues.   The vendors are under pressure (competitive and/or market)
to release the product.   Newer hardware are supported in the newer
kernel, back porting drivers to an older kernel release is extra work.
  You will notice that a .1 version update is available within 4-6
months time span.  Typically, it fixes a lot of annoyances in the .0
version.

Most IT departments seldom deploy a .0 version of any release into
production.   When 6.0 was first release around Oct/Nov 2010 I did a
quick eval; I also observed other's experience  with it (in this case
the CentOS mailing list) and decided it was best to stick with 5.x.
I have started 6.2 fresh installs (for production) only about 4 months
back.

You choose to install CentOS 6.0 when CentOS 6.3 was already released
around 9/July/2012 and that is your prerogative.  For production
deployment, I would have (a) read the Release Notes, (b) persue and/or
join the mailing list/forum + search it's archives, (c) wait for a .1
or .2 version for evaluation (in your case 6.3 was already available).

>In fact, it has been put under observation for one month to study its function and charactersistics. Erasing and
>resinstalling can be done without wasting time but what is the solution to existing malfunction?

As has been discussed in the thread, the issue appears to be with the
X server.  However, from your responses it is not clear to whether you
are not getting any Key/Mouse in the login display manager (GDM most
likely) or  does it disappear after the user is logged in.   For the
latter case, create a new user and then login.

>It is a case study whose end result could become beacon light for those who encounter such secnario in future. But >unfortunaetely, the solution is becoming elusive to our effort.

Absolutely agree in principle, however see my comment above.  One
option is to open a bug report on CentOS 6.0 (be ready to follow up
and provide information to the bug owner).

Had it been in production the answer would be no.

In the context of a "trial" and a CentOS *6.0* installation when 6.1,
6.2, 6.3 was already available;  I question why 6.0?

While reading Indian Language processing, found a great project called SILPA.
Find the online application here. http://silpa.org.in/

It can do major linguistic tasks like spellchecking, dictionary,
n-gram,sorting, encoding converter, language detection, transliterate,
text to speech, webfonts and more in major indian languages including
Tamil.

Thanks to the developer Santhosh Thottingal for the wonderful contribution.

It is fully developed in python.

Get the code from http://silpa.org.in/doc/source.html

Mailing list : https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/silpa-discuss

It needs more contribution.

It seems your card is an ATI. May be you can take a look at this link,

It provides instructions to install The graphics driver properly, Most

What is the advantage of this over Arduino ?  I know Pinguino uses PIC and

I have 12.04 and python 2.7.3 but Spellcheck works for me. I used to get
the same error a year back, was failing because dependencies had issues.
Thanks to your mail now, I tried again and it now works :)

Basically, Spellcheck page(or any silpa page if I am not wrong) tries to
render fonts using silpa's render module (which is failing for you). The
immidiete dependencies of render module of silpa I could think for this
could be missing python-cairo, pango-graphite etc packages . After that
install the following python packages cairo, pango, pangocairo. If it
doesn't work even after that, you need to debug modules/render/render.py
and figure out yourself :)

IIRC, I have seen you in IITB FSD couple of years back as a keynote

Hi All,

Recently i have started fancying the idea of Tamil typing and did some

I believe many of the ilug subscribers are active Tamil typers(If i may

Please suggest me a good application to start my Tamil typing learning

Yes as you said hardware wise it is different

In arduino FT232 used for USB communication whereas in Pinguino there is no
need for another smd ic (FT232)
so it is easy to assemble.
even u can use breadboard(8 bit version) to assemble it.

I don't know how  learned Tamil typing in Ubuntu, bust some how I did. 
One way to do it is write letters to your girl friend in Tamil . That 
will force you to think in Tamil ans make use of the keyboard ;-)

However, the concern is that if the centos produce such undesirable results within one month during its trial period then What would be its consequences on production server? In fact, it has been put under observation for one month to study its function and charactersistics. Erasing and resinstalling can be done without wasting time but what is the solution to existing malfunction? It is a case study whose end result could become beacon light for those who encounter such secnario in future. But unfortunaetely, the solution is becoming elusive to our effort.

Centos is more or less binary compatible with RHEL which comes with
paid support.

There is a very vibrant and responsive centos mailing list centos at
centos.org .

The primary targets of this distribution (and RHEL) is Enterprise and
datacentre market place as production or De/Testing before production
which could be having RHEL paid subscription. The key point is long
term support - 10 years for centos 5 and centos 6.

The long term support implies that the base packages do not so
considerable jumps in the point releases. i.e. if the base comes with
php5.2 it will remain that for support duration. so one may not find
the latest and greatest office version with this distro.

More importantly the fixes and patches are backported.

The first thing an administrator would do is to apply all the updates
before deploying.

In fact every administrated is strongly advised to update.

The difference between the point releases say 6.0 and 6.1 is like
service packs of  other products. For example a technology preview
(say XFS filesystem) in 6.0 may be production ready by 6.3. I am
quoting XFS as an example only. read the release notes.

The update process is fairly well tested and runs smooth almost all the time.

Rarely it breaks the running system. Most Security patches (CVA),
bugs, issues are handled upstream by redhat.

So in you scenario, I would try to ssh into the machine after booting
into level 3 and do an "yum update"

After that if you find problems, Centos list is always there --
sombody there might have faced the same problem as you have.

If you are into paid support from redhat, they are the first one to be
contacted.

Many members in that list are managing hundred and some thousands of
centos instances.

I agree with arun , you should not be compiling from source. That
should be the last option. Installing php, httpd and ssl is very easy
and can't be simpler. I would do the following on a rhel6 system. it
is similar in ubuntu. Most probably you will have to replace yum
command with apt-get.
" sudo yum install httpd php mod_ssl"

So installing php also gives me mod_php.

Hope it will be more interesting to see, if someone could give talk on
the below topics, as it would help many newbie programmers to
understand and follow GNU coding styles / standards when developing /
contributing to FOSS projects.

* GNU coding styles / standards
* Using gcc and g++ compilers (with detailed compiler options / optimizations)
* Using GNU make utility
* Using GNU autoconf and automake tools for generating configure
scripts and Makefiles
* Developing shared / static libraries with GCC
* Linux Kernel Module programming
* Guidelines to be followed when developing/contributing to
new/existing FOSS projects

Hi

In response to your valuable feedback and suggestions, I had executed the shell command

Xorg :1 -configure whose output is pasted on the pastebin.com with the URL 

http://pastebin.com/WAfBSea4  -----........Xorg :1 -configure

Unfortunately it generated the error output however it has created the xorg.conf file with the identification of mouse and key board whose config details are also pasted on pastebin with the URL

http://pastebin.com/4Z7bB1Zh  ----.........cat .../xorg.conf.new

Hopefully, it leads us to a conclusive solution with your valuable feedback.

Application: Shutter

What is it:

Shutter is a feature-rich screenshot program. You can take a
screenshot of a specific area, window, your whole screen, or even of a
website - apply different effects to it, draw on it to highlight
points, and then upload to an image hosting site, all within one
window.

Features:

    * take a screenshot of your complete desktop, a rectangular area
or capture a website
    * take screenshot directly or with a specified delay time
    * save the screenshots to a specified directory and name them in a
convenient way (using special wild-cards)
    * Shutter is fully integrated into the GNOME Desktop (TrayIcon etc.)
    * generate thumbnails directly when you are taking a screenshot
and set a size level in %
    * Shutter session collection
    * keep track of all screenshots during session
    * copy screeners to clipboard
    * print screenshots
    * delete screenshots
    * rename your file
    * upload your files directly to Image-Hosters (e.g.
http://ubuntu-pics.de), retrieve all the needed links and share them
with others
    * edit your screenshots directly using the embedded drawing tool

To know more about it:

I have built appliances using LEAF project of which I was a member.
Soekris was a hardware used by many. Since we were looking at 2/4GB
flash/CF, we used syslinux (Peter Anvin's project) and it worked well.
Syslinux is small and suffices when you need to use one OS alone.

+1
And I add Please ditch CentOS/RH and happily go for Debian/Ubuntu
solution adding few lines and running apt you will  have a eprints
library .

http://wiki.eprints.org/w/Installing_EPrints_3_via_apt_%28Debian/Ubuntu%29

I heavily recommend debian stable  for your production server instead
of a free /cheap alternative CentOS installation .

Dear shrini,

Scott, John, Stephen and I are happy to announce that the class website for
our Coursera course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python"
is now open. The class's homepage is viewable at


https://class.coursera.org/interactivepython-2012-001/class/index

The class website includes the first week of class materials as well as a
welcome survey that we encourage everyone to take. Class will officially
start on Oct. 15th, and your first quiz will be due on Oct. 18th. If you
have no previous programming experience, we strongly suggest that you start
looking over the first week's material this week and get an early start on
the first week's activities. (A typical week has 7-8 videos, but we've
included more videos in week one to provide more detail.) We'll be
monitoring the class forums this week for your questions.

We'd like to conclude by sharing a little bit of our philosophy for this
class. We've built a new tool (CodeSkulptor) that will make the process of
creating, saving and sharing your Python programs easy. We've designed the
class curriculum to be fun (focusing on making simple games). However,
learning enough programming to be "dangerous" is a challenging task. We're
going to ask you to work hard (we estimate 7-9 hours a week). For our part,
we have four instructors and lots of community TAs who are committed to
answering your questions on the forums and helping you succeed.

We're all very excited to be offering this class, and we hope you are
equally excited to be taking it.

I would recommend you try *Tamil 99*..
It is very simple and Easy to learn and adapt....
Keyboard Mapping:  http://blog.ravidreams.net/tamil99/

To start learning Tamil 99, you may try typing
http://www.tamil99.org/tamil99-typing-tutor.pdf

Later, when you have enough confidence on your typing method, you may try
typing tamil articles over the internet (For instance, There are thousands
of wikipedia articles in Tamil to help you learn typesetting)...

All the best!

Hope I helped you...

One way to configure Xorg, just remove the config file and restart,
Xorg will create one automatically with sane defaults.
So, try to rename the Xorg file into some thing else, connect the
components and restart. See if it works. (Worked for my monitor)

I did not make any changes to the bootloader, I used the existing
bootloader which flashes via serial( P89V51RD2).


Yes,  the source is open but i did not update the last changes i made, yet
as far as python scripting is concerned you can understand by making diff
with original.

https://github.com/codelectron/Neo51-IDE

For flashing the controller I used this project, which i incorporated
within the tools section.

Message-ID: <CAJLBBzxkaE0RNi0OGDEe6gzd4ahTMAJztsau_aC1m9G=V8rbUw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Recently I started using the linux traffic control (tc) utility for
setting up the QoS.
I came to know, there is another utility called "tcng", which serves
better & more features.
IS tcng completely different utility? Has it built from scratch (or)
developed on top of "tc"?

Basically i want to compare "tc & tcng", which one have more features
and easiness.

Can someone share their experience?

regards
suresh.

tc is part of iproute2 package which comes standard with the distro.
Do not know about tcng. tcng is supposed to be far easier to use as
compared to tc. Have no personal hands on time with tcng and thus
cannot qualify this with experience.

Apologies for my earlier top post and reply to my own post.

Just went thro' the tcng documentation. It is indeed far simpler as
compared to tc to declare classes, filters, rates etc and also
examples include a two rate three colour meter example which is pretty
difficult in tc. Reading through it, it also seems to avoid the
potential to make mistakes of precedence/ hierarchy easily with tc and
wonder why the prescribed traffic is not getting the bandwidth
configured.

All examples given typically talk of a single tiered configuration
which is generally true for most small office LANs. Will need to read
through configuration examples to see how a multi-tiered configuration
is built.

Class declarations, filtering apart, this seems to default to HTB
which was a fairly new qdisc in the late 1990s/early 2000s. Seems like
it has matured and used in conjunction with SFQ gives good results.

Dear mahalingam,

  If xorg,conf file is not found means, xorg will recognize input devices,
graphics card by autodetection.So please check the two daemons are started
properly,

1.hal
2. udev

Hi Vignesh

The output for the above service to check is as follows

[root at eprints autostart]# chkconfig --list | grep hal
haldaemon       0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off

As the XkbModel and XkbLayout options are missing in the InputDevice

with *) and copy the xorg.conf.new to /etc/X11/xorg.conf and test it
with running 'xinit' from the terminal (instead of startx).

Nice to hear about that.

But, SORRY for differing in view.
In my view, any foundations/ organisations should reward people when they
are with us (except in case of few awards related to bravery). That will
serve as a proper recognition to his/ her service. That would make them
also proud of their service.
 This is purely my personal view.

Dear All

In response to this thread, I have activated the haldaemon and restarted the service for the same. Hence the keyboard & mouse has been reactivated to its normal function. Now it is fine. My Sincere Thanks to one and all who have contributed and patiently, repeatedly taking response to my queries.
Thanks once again to all. Our patience and resilience paid off.

Congrats on finding the offending service that kept tripping you.

In my CentOS 6.2 setup (default server installation); hal daemon is
"active" by default.   I did *not* tinker with any of the services
post installation.      It begs the question why is it not enabled by
default in 6.0?

It reaffirms my point about avoiding the .0 version of software
release that I made in an earlier post.

For your production server, I would suggest upgrading to CentOS 6.2 or
6.3 if CentOS is what you want.

Alternately, as Pavithran has suggested you could also look into
Debian, the Debian users will vouch for it.   I have even deployed
it's "testing" release (kind of  beta/release candidate)  into
production - in gateway devices.

>From your email id, looks like you are from a research organization.
BOSS Linux [1]  has been developed by CDAC
targeted for the government organizations.   CDAC provides support via
 CDAC locations across pan India.     I have
no experience with it.  However it is Debian based.

Hi

I agree with Mr.Arun that I have downloaded and kept ready the Debian unix 6.0 in the meantime. However, I don't want to skip from  finding solution to this issue whose end result shall be useful for every others who follows the centos. It all happened suddenly as it was working well all these days which kept worrying & surprsing me as to what would have gone wrong with it? I could find solution with the help of everyone including Mr.Vignesh, Mr.Pavithran, Mr. Mohan, Mr.Baskar, Mr.Narendran, Mr.Rajagoapal and every others.

As far as concerned, C-DAC's BOSS, I was bit reluctant to experiment it on productio service due to unfamiliarity & unpopular among the professinals though the C-DAC has assured its full support and assistance.

with regards
s.mahalingam

My first few centos 6 installs were 6.0. I did not face any such problems.

No tinkering.

Of course later I added some packages from EPEL etc.

Still rock solid.

Later I updated them. Things are running smoothly even after updates.



To the deb fanboi calling centos "cheap": Debian's so called LTS is
only 5 years. Centos has had 7 years for a long time and now it is 10
years.

People who develop "real production" software will mostly agree with
me that an application of medium complexity takes about 18-24 months
to go from Initial point of contact to production ready state signoff.
Now if one selects a deployment platform having 5 year support and
which is already 12 months old, they have effectively only two to
three year support for the platform after the system goes into
production.

Try convincing the CFO/CEO/CTO for anything less and you are staring
at not so palatable possibilities.

BTW who gives commercial support for deb?

Not individuals/humans, entities like companies only please.

Companies like companies who can be blamed or sued.

So don't badmouth other distros. they are cousins after all.

The alternative is of course closed proprietary software, vendor
lock-in and the such.

Each distro serves a purpose.

And oh, IT would be interesting so see how many RHEL/centos/other
derivatives boxes are out there in the wild purring along...

It probably is a case where all the external IPs or a bank belongs to
the same organisation. Their internal routers would route these and
also private ranges using static routes.

Problem of how they would have built the network. Using public IPs for
internal networks instead of creating private subnets and keeping
public IPs part of their ISP core routing infrastructure. When this
luxury is available, they may have used these to avoid NAT'ting and
being able to use negotiated port protocols without worrying about
ALGs etc....

What about these then?

72.25.81.133 (172.25.81.133)                        176.625ms asymm  6

All of them are RFC1918 IPs. Not to be used in a public n/w

Looks like your router/gateway could be misconfigured. There is no way
a packet with 192.168.2.10 allowed to go out on the public network.
That it gets routed some home to some other machine with a private IP
is a different issue altogether.

Valid observation and point being made. Check if your routes excludes
RFC1918 addresses from going out to the Internet facing interface. If
not, modify routing table using static tables to do so.

There is no misconfiguration. The "default route" is used for networks which
the machine doesn't know about.

This looks like the LAN interface of your gateway.

This is the IP at the far end of your leased line connection.

Your packet  goes into a "public" network segment.

and then it traverses through a private "network segment" within  the
public network segment.

To you the "Public" network segment is the ISP.

I have seen this technique being used since the early days of consumer
ISPs (c. 1994).    It is an efficient usage of a scarce resource i.e.
IPv4 numbers.

Expect to see more and more ISPs adopting this technique within the "ISP" cloud.

When you traceroute to 8.8.8.8 (which is outside the ISP's cloud), you
will see the egress point from the ISP with a "public" IP number.

Thats good spirit which is kind of lacking these days , Very Happy
that you solved your problem without switching the distro . :)

I happen to have a Tata Indicom DSL service, so decided to do it
myself and here is what the traceroute to 8.8.8.8 looks like:

$ traceroute 8.8.8.8
traceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  172.16.0.1 (172.16.0.1)  0.371 ms  0.639 ms  0.562 ms

My LAN GW (bastion host)

 2  192.168.192.1 (192.168.192.1)  1.370 ms  3.781 ms  6.432 ms

My ISP GW.

 3  114.143.97.1 (114.143.97.1)  161.518 ms  165.061 ms  166.895 ms

This is the far end of my DSL connection in the TI cloud.

 4  192.168.176.9 (192.168.176.9)  45.981 ms  54.189 ms  54.546 ms

Traverses through a router 192.168.176.9 in the "private IP" range within TI.

 5  202.149.208.68 (202.149.208.68)  52.857 ms  56.895 ms  95.901 ms

Packet goes out to the "Public" segment within TI.

 6  115.113.139.233.static-lvsb.vsnl.net.in (115.113.139.233)  63.403
ms  50.644 ms  53.538 ms
 7  115.113.165.98.static-mumbai.vsnl.net.in (115.113.165.98)  57.162
ms  40.019 ms  41.990 ms

This is the egress point to the Internet WAN from VSNL (M&A'd with TI).

 8  72.14.232.99 (72.14.232.99)  44.094 ms  40.412 ms  41.891 ms

There is no in-addr.arpa PTR for above.   This is most likely Google's
ingress point.

 9  google-public-dns-a.google.com (8.8.8.8)  44.319 ms  48.145 ms  49.922 ms

the Destination IP.

Interestingly, TI is honouring ICMP echo request from  192.168.176.9

$ ping 192.168.176.9
PING 192.168.176.9 (192.168.176.9) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.176.9: icmp_req=1 ttl=252 time=45.8 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.176.9: icmp_req=2 ttl=252 time=40.6 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.176.9: icmp_req=3 ttl=252 time=39.2 ms

Question:  Had my LAN network address space been 192.168.176.X instead
of 172.16.0.X, would I still have gotten the ping responses?

Are you saying that the 'haldaemon' in your 6.0 setup (without your
tinkering) was 'on' by default in the installation process?

If so, then OP needs to audit how the heck it was set to 'off' in his setup.

One possible reason why you may see this is if you have a VPN established
with an office at another location.  The other location could be using the
IP 192.168.2.10/24.

Subject: [Ilugc] [DIRE-HOPE] - suggestion for Ilug threads considering
 (fast) forwarding technology, education and career related threads
Message-ID: <CA+Ydgap_nVJxahT8YMPXwpGBV+18oeHCu5RfwKkBBVDd+jM7NA@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

Purpose:
To initiate and sustain a thread which will endure, contribute
accurate, practical and useful knowledge and skills for generations to
come by endowing them with the "inside" knowledge and hence giving
them the Occam's razor and necesary crisp tips and tools  to weed out
salestalk and succeed in life using open source methodology.

Locii standii:
I have been a subscriber of this list for a very miniscule period
considering the list's lifetime.

I wish The list outlives me by decades.

I know a bit or two in technology, be it electrical, carpentary,
civil, metullurgical, financial and the such: call it occupational
hazard.

I am not a PhD. I will never arrogate myself beyond a SSC/HSC/high
school pass maverick. (You have been warned, "Graduates" ;) )

I am a man with family responsibilities which more or less excludes me
from following my dream. I am an "aam-aadmi" not an "aam khane waala
aadmi" (mango eating person)

When faced with solving an open source query, I more often than not
have to choose catching a train or a bus.

I have spent over a quarter of a century in the treacherous trenches of IT.

I *do* expect somebody to respond to this post.

Precedents:
I have posted several links in the past to get a discussion going on
various aspects of getting respectability from the "industry",
whatever it is, for an aspiring "professional"

I don't have the "missionary zeal" of KG, but make no mistake, I too
have dream -- a big one at that. Dreamers are "poor" by definition of
course.

Assumptions:

Given that everyone have the luxury of following their passion,  it is
not possible and probable given the nature of Indian scenario, that
everybody has to agree with what is being set out here.

Academia has the most horrible intake of technology in India. contrast
western academia which *produces* technology. I won't blame them. They
are bound by the draconian politicians and the "system"

Intentions:

To have a holistic approach, not piece meal approach.

The entire IT landscape is to be mapped and open and closed source
software used in every domain where IT is used.

Endeavor to develop an subcontinent wide support ecosystem. At the end
of the day, any solution's success depends upon the ability to get a
neighborhood support person to fix a problem.

Past efforts and weaknesses:

Self-centeredness. ego-centricism. "fanboi" mentality. patronising
attitude. Lack of humility.

eg: There was an effort to write a text book for CBSE in in doldrums.
The entire opportunity was wasted away.

Every community effort initiated is viewed with jaundiced eye, or
worse, by ignoring it and worst, by not appreciating it.

Lack of feedback on solutions provided.

Observations:

Trust. Trust is the building block.

Verification is the cement.

Possibilities:

Every one in this list is trusted. Hence every idea/statement is
valid/true because somebody has taken effort to make it public.

Of course it is obvious and necessary that it has to be verified.

Of course it is possible that some people can and make money off it. so be it.

The key point is let the idea take the leadership.

Multi-lingual oral transmission in colloquial and local paradigms.

Some suggestions for way forward:

1. FSF India / various ILUGs ratification of
courses/methodologies/products/projects (with Due credits  and
_respect_ to the initiators)
2. Initiate projects in association with the govt to get traction
(Govt has money and lot of scope for such projects)
3. Collaborate with SME/Pvt/BFSI players for commercial aspects
4. Focus on solving existential problems though it is sometimes
excruciating to our beloved ego.
5. Design for failures.
6. Exploring Multiple deployment patterns
7. Acting (and not re-acting) on negative feedback (any control system
would know it instinctively)

Parting thoughts:
We as a community should be driving force.

India with over 1/6th of population should better start leading the
knowledge transmission with confidence and not with fear of being
overtaken -- a Guru never fears a shishya.

I will request the readers to contemplate last sukta of the oldest
known open source text to humans -- Rigveda -- from our very own soil:

http://sanskrit.safire.com/pdf/RIGVED.PDF -- Page 2

1. Agni, showerer (of benefits), thou who art the lord, thou verily
combinest with all creatures, thou art kindled upon the footmark of
Ila, bring unto us riches.

2. Go together, speak together, know your minds to be functioning
together from a common source, in same manner as the impulses of
creative intelligence, in the
beginning, remain together united near the source.

3. Integrated is the expression of knowledge, an assembly is
significant in unity, united are their minds while full of desires.
For you I make use of the integrated expression of knowledge.

4. United be your purpose, harmonious be your feelings, collected be
your mind, in the same way as all the various aspects of the universe
exist in togetherness,
wholeness.

I submit with Regards,

Subject: [Ilugc] [Commercial] Hardware and system admin support in Bangalore
Message-ID: <20121009225829.GA16693@panahar>

Sorry for cross posting. I have posted this on Bangalore lug mailing
list sometime back but got no response. I am hoping that there will be
someone on this list who can help.

A small academic organisation I am associated with is shifting its
office to Bangalore. The organisation is hoping to find office space
near Indira Nagar.

The organisation was earlier based in Kolkata where the setup was
something like this. The organisation has about 15 computers. Most
computers run linux (mostly ubuntu or debian), there are two macbooks
and a two or three computers running windows XP natively. Some linux
computers run windows XP over virtualbox for one or two applications.
The computers were networked: some computers were connected using
wires while others connected over wifi. There are three printers that
were used over the network (served by CUPS). One computer doubled up
as a database (MySQL) server to which most other computers need to
connect (using ODBC).

The entire setup is expected to move from Kolkata to Bangalore.

We are looking for a person/company to provide hardware/software
maintenance for the organisation in Bangalore.

Since the systems mainly run on linux, we are looking for a service
provider that can provide good support for it. The company will have
to provide maintenance, with promise of fixing problems in a specified
maximum time, and provision of substitutes if the problems cannot be
addressed. The company will have to ensure that its personnel are
adequately trained and can provide these services quickly, without
compromising security, and with least disruption to the users. The
personnel of the company will have to make regular visits (twice a
week) and do the routine administration.

If anyone (individuals, or individuals representing companies)
provides such services in Bangalore, please do get in touch.

I hope that we can find somebody to provide such support.

Assuming it is a 192.168.176.0/24 subnet is your local subnet, your
router will not route the packet destined for 192.168.176.9 out of
your subnet. Answer -  you will get a reply from a m/c in the LAN if
it exists.

Hi,

I have a headless Ubuntu 12.04 server and I have a C application which has
to run on system startup *AND* the C application has to have access to an
USB keyboard. I am using a small USB numeric keyboard. The program need not
run in the background as it is the only program which will be running. It
would be great if it can run on tty0 and allow getty to run on other tty's
for debugging. Is this possible? Some searching on the net gave me
directions, but would like to hear from somebody on the list who can help.

Is it interactive that it requires a keyboard?  Can it be modified to
remove this hardware requirement?

> The program need not
> run in the background as it is the only program which will be running.

If it is not interactive and is supposed to be *always* running, then
it is better to run it as a daemon and redirect it's output to a log
file like all other daemons do.   The log file location and file perms
is up to you if want to give access to non root users to read it's
content.

For input it you could program it to take it from a FIFO file.

You could hack an init script wherein you redirect std out/err to a
logfile(s) and run the program in the background like
[  -x /usr/local/bin/myCprog  ] && /usr/local/bin/myCprog
1>/var/log/myCprog.log 2>&1   &

Don't forget to create a log rotate conf file to rotate the log files.

I suppose so.   Just like you can redirect kernel logs to a tty + log files.

Message-ID: <CALJ7LH9Xhog4eAXPWR6Ku3dVMDJ30h4A5gVFaAg7XnCkDL+MWA@mail.gmail.com>

Application: BleachBit

What is it:

BleachBit deletes unnecessary files to free valuable disk space,
maintain privacy, and remove junk. It removes cache, Internet history,
temporary files, cookies, and broken shortcuts.

It handles cleaning of Adobe Reader, Bash, Beagle, Epiphany, Firefox,
Flash, GIMP, Google Earth, Java, KDE, OpenOffice.org, Opera,
RealPlayer, rpmbuild, Second Life Viewer, VIM, XChat, and more.

Beyond simply erasing junk files, BleachBit wipes free disk space (to
hide previously deleted files for privacy and to improve compression
of images), vacuums Firefox databases (to improve performance without
deleting data), and securely shreds arbitrary files.

To know more about it:

Hi,

I am selling a FreeRunner [1] phone running QtMoko [2] distribution.

Everything from bootloader, to kernel, to rootfs can be modified. The
Qt UI screenshots [3] are available. There are quite a number of Qt
applications available [4] for the device, and the wiki [5]
documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date.

I am also providing a 512 MB micro SD card, battery, USB cable,
stylus, and pouch for the phone.

If you are interested in buying the same, please send me a private
e-mail (and not to the list).

The device can also run other supported distributions, like Android [6].

  You can append the line suggested by Arun Khan to /etc/rc.local.
That way, you don't have to change/add anything in /etc/init.d/*

pardon my ignorance i could not follow anything below these lines ,
can you put in the following format

What is that you trying to solve or fix? which you think is not
working ok with the present system.
How do you plan do it?
How do you propose to sustain this effort.

Subject: [Ilugc] Need help on configuring A Loadbalanced Apache Cluster
	Based On Ubuntu
Message-ID: <CALJ7LH_ABXXuSDBYN8nAZm-J=RJB7nec7pJBh3yhOwShzGrnyg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi geeks,

For the last two days, i am trying to configure A Loadbalanced Apache Cluster.

I have a virtual box, in which i installed 3 ubuntu 10.04 server machine

I did as following


System          Name            IP

Virtual IP	evergreen	10.129.50.185
Load node 1:	load1		10.129.50.182
Apache node1:	Apache01	10.129.50.183
Apache node2:	Apache02	10.129.50.184


1.  Enable IPVS on load balancer.

echo ip_vs_dh >> /etc/modules
echo ip_vs_ftp >> /etc/modules
echo ip_vs >> /etc/modules
echo ip_vs_lblc >> /etc/modules
echo ip_vs_lblcr >> /etc/modules
echo ip_vs_lc >> /etc/modules
echo ip_vs_nq >> /etc/modules
echo ip_vs_rr >> /etc/modules
echo ip_vs_sed >> /etc/modules
echo ip_vs_sh >> /etc/modules
echo ip_vs_wlc >> /etc/modules
echo ip_vs_wrr >> /etc/modules

modprobe ip_vs_dh
modprobe ip_vs_ftp
modprobe ip_vs
modprobe ip_vs_lblc
modprobe ip_vs_lblcr
modprobe ip_vs_lc
modprobe ip_vs_nq
modprobe ip_vs_rr
modprobe ip_vs_sed
modprobe ip_vs_sh
modprobe ip_vs_wlc
modprobe ip_vs_wrr

2. Install ipvsadm and ldirectord ,heartbeat. Get perl-doc also in
order to read the ldirectord help pages.

apt-get install ipvsadm

apt-get install ldirectord

apt-get install perl-doc

apt-get install heartbeat

3. Enable packet forwarding on the load balancer in /etc/sysctl.conf.
Then load the new setting.

# Enables packet forwarding
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

sysctl -p

4. Configure ipvsadm. Running dpkg-reconfigure will create the two
files ipvsadm.rules and ipvsadm.

dpkg-reconfigure ipvsadm
Load on boot:  No
Daemon method: none

/etc/ipvsadm.rules
# emtpy rules file for ipvsadm

/etc/default/ipvsadm
AUTO="false"
DAEMON="none"



5. Configure ldirectord.

/etc/ha.d/ldirectord.cf
checktimeout=10
checkinterval=2
autoreload=no
logfile="/var/log/ldirectord.log"
quiescent=yes
virtual=10.129.50.185:80
    real=10.129.50.183:80 gate
    real=10.129.50.184:80 gate
    service=http
    request="ldirector.html"
    receive="Test Page"
    scheduler=wlc
    protocol=tcp
    checktype=negotiate
virtual=10.129.50.185:443
    real=10.129.50.183:443 gate
    real=10.129.50.184:443 gate
    service=http
    request="ldirector.html"
    receive="Test Page"
    scheduler=wlc
    protocol=tcp
    checktype=negotiate



Point to this file in /etc/default/ldirectord
CONFIG_FILE=/etc/ha.d/ldirectord.cf

Status of ldirector:

ldirectord ldirectord.cf status

The actual output should like below

\1 better written as $1 at /usr/sbin/ldirectord line 1252.
\1 better written as $1 at /usr/sbin/ldirectord line 1252.
ldirectord for /etc/ha.d/ldirectord.cf is running with pid: 2629

but for me

\1 better written as $1 at /usr/sbin/ldirectord line 1252.
\1 better written as $1 at /usr/sbin/ldirectord line 1252.
ldirectord stopped for /etc/ha.d/ldirectord.cf

7. Start ldirectord.

/etc/init.d/ldirectord start

ipvsadm -L -n
IP Virtual Server version 1.2.1 (size=4096)
Prot LocalAddress:Port Scheduler Flags
  -> RemoteAddress:Port           Forward Weight ActiveConn InActConn
TCP  10.129.50.185:80 wlc
  -> 10.129.50.183:80             Route   1      0          0
  -> 10.129.50.184:80             Route   1      0          0
TCP  10.129.50.185:443 wlc
  -> 10.129.50.183:443            Route   0      0          0
  -> 10.129.50.184:443            Route   0      0          0


The load balancer should list the virtual IP:

ip addr sh eth0

2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether 78:2b:cb:11:93:9c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.129.50.182/16 brd 10.129.127.255 scope global eth0

8. Configure the apache nodes to accept requests on the virtual IP
10.129.50.185.

/etc/sysctl.conf

net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore = 1
net.ipv4.conf.eth0.arp_ignore = 1
net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_announce = 2
net.ipv4.conf.eth0.arp_announce = 2

Load the new settings:
sysctl -p


9. Configure /etc/ha.d/haresources (to start ldirectord from heartbeat).

load1   \
        ldirectord::ldirectord.cf \
        IPaddr2::10.129.50.185/16/eth0 \

10. Configure network interface for the virtual IP on the apache servers.

/etc/network/interfaces
# Load balancing virtual interface
auto lo:0
iface lo:0 inet static
  address 10.129.50.185
  netmask 255.255.0.0
  pre-up sysctl -p > /dev/null

enable the interface:
ifup lo:0

Run ifconfig to verify interface is up:
lo:0      Link encap:Local Loopback
          inet addr:10.129.50.185  Mask:255.255.0.0
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1

11. Create /var/www/ldirector.html on the apache servers.

Test Page

12. Test.

Browse to 10.129.50.185 (virtual IP)

Everying done without error. But Virtual IP not displaying anything
and i can ping load balancer 10.129.50.182 but i can not ping
10.129.50.183 and 10.129.50.184 apache servers.

Hi,

I followed the below link for implementing LVS for Apache load
balancing on CentOS 5.5 / Fedora-14 (without using ldirectord) and it
worked well.  Though the article looks pretty old, but still the
instructions were good enough for implementing them.

Yes it is interactive. I am using the keyboard instead of  hardware
switches (it is an embedded project). Few keys are used to change modes and
one key is used to start the work. The modes are displayed in a 16x2 alpha
numeric LCD module.

It is interactive, as explained above.
It is like a POS device without a monitor.

Sure. I am still working on it. Will keep the list posted about the final

Simplest solution, the program starts, but receives no keyboard input.

Thanks Arun, Balachandran & Vignesh
Ok, I got it working

As mentioned earlier, simply adding the app to inittab did not work. It was
running, but was not taking any keyboard input.
BTW, I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and there is no /etc/inittab. There is a file
/etc/init/tty1.conf which configures what runs in tty1.
The solution involved wrapping the app in a shell script like this one:

#!/bin/sh
exec </dev/tty1
exec >/dev/tty1
exec 2>/dev/tty1
/path/to/app

and then calling this wrapper script instead of the app from init/upstart :

[/etc/init/tty1.conf]
.
.
.
respawn
exec /path/to/wrapper-script



Thanks and regards,
Arun

Did you use 15 or upgraded from lower version? I experience the same effect
in my FF 15 from the day I upgraded and I'm yet to update to 16.

Anyone else facing this issue in 15? I run it on Ubuntu 11.04.

You can give sudo access to your user, and will be able to run yum with sudo:

Hi

I have some Tamil books downloaded from projectmadurai.org which are in pdf
format.  I would like to use an eBook reader (Kindle or Nook) for reading
them. For that first I need to convert the tamil pdf books into eBook
format. I tried some tools in windows without any success. Tamil fonts are
converted into  junk characters.


Is there any open source software which I can use in Ubuntu 12.04 for
converting the Tamil pdf books into eBook format?  I shall very much
appreciate any suggestions from ilugc members in this regard.

Use the html versions to convert to epub format. It is more easier. I tried
with calibre for ponniyin selvan once and I was not able to do it correctly
- mostly its my mistake and I did not try again. But calibre is great and
it works for many (I have seen many people using it).

Who hasn't gotten excited about a new Internet service, only to discover
that it falls short on free software values?

The Web is full of services for posting, sharing and commenting on media,
but most of them require you to run nonfree software or share your data
with third parties on their terms. It seems like these problems are just
getting worse, with more and more of our media and personal information
hoarded in the hard drives of a few giant corporations, and previous uses
of nonfree Flash being replaced with nonfree JavaScript. Determined to find
a better way, FSF member Chris Webber started the GNU MediaGoblin project.
He's leading a community team to write a next-generation social web system
where users will share their experiences through photos, videos and audio,
all without running proprietary software or centralizing personal data in
the hands of a corporation.

Right now MediaGoblin is partially developed, but the team needs financial
support so that they can quit their day jobs for a year and perfect
MediaGoblin's features to a professional level. The FSF believes their
project is important to the future of the Internet and free software, so
we're partnering with them to launch a crowdfunding campaign, complete with
creative prizes for donors (give $350, and Chris will make you a 3D-print
of Gavroche the goblin, the project's cute mascot).

A search for 'debian automated install'  comes up with quite few
potentially helpful links.

Your link appears to be a replica of an official Debian doc; the 'tmp'
in the URL string suggests (at least to me) that it may not be there
when you need it.

For Squeeze, this is what I found
<http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/apb.html>   It appears to
be the best fit that is out there.  From cursory look at other links,
the base functionality is the same.

In the same search, I also found FAI which claims to do automated
install for a bunch of Linux distros.   YMMV,  I have no experience
with it.

Please share your experience if you do explore FAI.

Message-ID: <1016755201.315560.1350136156196.JavaMail.root@mail.kgisl.org>

Can anyone point me to a Linux tablet with minimum 7" display with USB support for keyboard and mouse?

Can I run Linux (Puppy or any other light distro) on a low cost 7" Android tablet?

I don't  need things like camera, mic, accelerometer etc- just the basic display, kbd, mouse, WiFI will do under Linux.

Thanks

Call it a frustrated linux user , whats wrong with tablet/hardware
makers ? Why cant they bring some some linux based tablets , by linux
I mean the ones which come with linux kernel and hopefully free
drivers instead of binary blobs and other junk we get out of android !

I understand with phones they have an issue of lack of GSM drivers ,
but with tablets whats the issue ? Or did google steal the show with
android ?

I also would just love to run debian with gnome or kde or xfce or even
unity on a tablet ! Hope hardware manufacturers listen :(

Archos tablets are famous for Linux Support, even though by default it's
coming with Android.

You will have your hardware but no drivers to use. In the embedded world
manufacturers are thinking of keeping things very close as even a small
margin in profit (0.1 $ or 5 rupees per unit) due to difference in code can
and will make a very huge difference. I do have seen things similar in
other products. So they are not ready to provide documentation for their
devices which means no drivers for devices (especially graphics cards,
video decoding units) and also due to Digital Rights Management (which
makes it clear that people should not be able to see how things are going
in inside - mandated by hollywood and other business people).

You are more than welcome to buy an android tablet, root it and try to
figure out how a graphics card or video decoding unit works. There are
similar projects already - lima driver for Mali GPU, freedrino, etc.
Figuring out how a PowerVR SGX graphics card (used by *many* embedded
manufacturers and in high end to mid end phones) works is listed as high
priority project by fsf but things are not moving very fast. Interested
people can contribute to those projects.

Thanks that answers some things , any idea who is the bul manufracture
of graphics chipset ? Noveau is a good project but I am not sure if
something similar exists in tablet graphic components .

Hello, everyone.

We need to finish any final editing before Tuesday.  So if there are
any changes that still need to be made, please make them now.

You can review the public draft of the PDF at
<http://ubuntu-manual.org/proofread/gswu1210/en>.  I've incorporated
most of the suggestions and feedback from the public so far.

Starting on Tuesday I will be finalizing the manual for publication.
We will publish the manual on Thursday to coincide with the release of
Ubuntu 12.10.

Thanks!

Dear Knights;
 Low cost tablets aside any comments on Raspberry Pi, an alternative!

PowerVR graphics card is licensed (not sold in units) I guess - similar to
how ARM is getting licensed. Imagination technologies is the company behind
that. Qualcomm has its own GPU unit called adrino (AMD sold its embedded
GPU business unit to qualcomm). Nvidia has its own GPU for embedded
systems. Mali graphics core is from ARM itself.

I am not sure of the bulk manufacturers. Many companies use different GPU
in different products / models. In embedded world if I choose a particular
CPU, the GPU comes along with it in most of the cases. The tight
integration helps to reduce cost drastically. I am not aware of
manufacturers manufacturing embedded GPUs stand alone.

Check for hackberry boards. It seems to be good - higher cost than
raspberry pi but way more powerful.
https://www.miniand.com/products/Hackberry%20A10%20Developer%20Board has
the details like spec and price.

Hope this helps,

Message-ID: <CALJ7LH8P3sovpta4RgbC48Zujq=Ct26+9CEEKYZZr2A60BewzA@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Figaro's Password Manager 2

What is it:

Figaro's Password Manager 2 (FPM2) is a program that allows you to
securely store the passwords. Passwords are encrypted with the AES-256
algorithm.

If the password is for a web site, FPM2 can keep track of the URLs of
your login screens and can automatically launch your browser. In this
capacity, FPM2 acts as a kind of bookmark manager. You can teach FPM2
to launch other applications, and optionally pass hostnames, usernames
or passwords to the command line.

FPM2 also has a password generator that can choose passwords for you.
It allows you to determine how long the password should be, and what
types of characters (lower case, upper case, numbers and symbols)
should be used. You can even have it avoid ambiguous characters such
as a capital O or the number zero.

To know more about it:

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install fpm2

In a nutshell, the Linux Foundation will obtain a Microsoft Key and
sign a small pre-bootloader which will, in turn, chain load (without
any form of signature check) a predesignated boot loader which will,
in turn, boot Linux (or any other operating system). The
pre-bootloader will employ a ?present user? test to ensure that it
cannot be used as a vector for any type of UEFI malware to target
secure systems. This pre-bootloader can be used either to boot a
CD/DVD installer or LiveCD distribution or even boot an installed
operating system in secure mode for any distribution that chooses to
use it.  The process of obtaining a Microsoft signature will take a
while, but once it is complete, the pre-bootloader will be placed on
the Linux Foundation website for anyone to download and make use of.

I was invited to a panel discussion on the topic on 14th Nov in
Bangalore at OSI, 9th Edition.
Apart from myself (Kolkata GLUG), the panel included Raj Mathur
(ilugd), Kingsley
John (Bangalore lug), T. Shrinivasan (ilugc).  Shrivathsa of Bangalore
LUG/HP coordinated the discussion.

Of course, I mentioned the importance of GLUGs, activities of GLUG
Kolkata, FSMWB, importance of organisations like FSMK, problems with
Govt policy, etc, The discussion was lively with few disagreements and
the audience was quite active.

Other ilugc menbers were also present on the day.

Please add more details.

Open Source India Days [ OSI Days ] is an annual event to promote Free
Open Source Software by Electronics For You Team.

Two years ago, When they had this event in Chennai, I was part of a
discussion panel. Met many people involved in FOSS World.

This year, they had the event in Banglore for 3 days with various
talks and sessions. I attended the last day only.

I was part of a discussion panel on ?Role of LUGs in FOSS Promotion?.

We had Myself for ILUG-Chennai, A.Mani from Kolkatta GLUG, Raj Mathur
from LUG Delhi, Kingsley John  from Bangalore LUG and Shrivathsa of
Bangalore LUG/HP coordinated the discussion.

We discussed about the importance of GLUGs, activities of GLUGs in
India, Importance of organizations like FSMK,  FSFTN, Problems with
Govt policy, etc, The discussion was lively with few disagreements and
the audience was quite active.

In the after noon, I gave a talk on ?How to contribute to FOSS without
Programming?. Many people think that contributing code is the great
way of contributing. No. There are so many other same important tasks,
looking for people to contribute.

The session was so interactive and good to see more people are already
contributing in many ways.

Here is my slide:
http://www.slideshare.net/tshrinivasan/contribute-tofreeopensourcesoftwarewithoutprogramming

I met some great people from various parts of India. Mani, Raj Mathur
are known persons for ages. But meeting them is so interesting.

Got to meet some ILUGC friends too. Girish, Sathish, Atul Jha, Yogesh,
Kumaran were discussing about various stuff.

Thanks for the EFY team. Niraj, Diksha Gupta and their Team did a
great job of organising such a nice event. Thanks for all the
speakers, participants and the sponsors.

Hi All,

I have made a small contribution to Minix (an open source operating system
with BSD license). Most of the people would have known about this. I am
putting this here cause seeing this people may get encouraged to contribute
to open source projects. Please see the discussion at
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/minix3/-/Olq83HlEZGgJ. Contributing back to
community is really helpful in many ways - improves the coding skills,
understanding the software development work flow, learning SCM, learning to
work with community, etc.

Message-ID: <68249124.326496.1350355186054.JavaMail.root@mail.kgisl.org>

So, can I summarise like this:

1. There are no low cost tablets pre-loaded with Linux.

2. 'Some' Android tablets can be tinkered with and one can load Linux on them - Ex: Archos tablets. But these are expensive, so it does not answer the original question.
-------------------------

In which case, let me rephrase the question:

3. I see Zync, Wespro and other companies giving away low cost Android tablets with 10" display at Rs. 7,000/- to Rs. 8,000/-

Can anyone help me load Linux on these devices, so that I can connect a keyboard and mouse and use it as a low cost laptop?

Thanks
...KRS

project.
We can load Ubintu in FriendlyARM. Cehck it out.

Subject: [Ilugc] Databases and open source
Message-ID: <CALDskyzGWrLpGL7V+8x_MYwWZ29WUn6UxyZxXe4wRkThkrQ8HA@mail.gmail.com>

I think everyone knows mySQL.

It is a popular brand like Linux. How many know Postgres?

How many SQLite?

Like the debate between emacs and vi or between Linux and BSD there
are people who prefer
 Postgres to mySQL.

And with the commercial giant Oracle acquiring mySQL a lot of things change.

In fact a very funny anecdote will make you laugh.

I grew pally with a Postgresql booth member in the recent conference
where mySQL was being
 talked about in sickening length and detail. None of the delegates
were very good, the Japanese guy
 had lot of trouble talking English and the only good presenter was
the only girl speaker in the conference.

Lot of Oracle shirts and lobbying.

Then after the girl stopped talking I spotted this Postresql guy who I
befriended. In fact in traditional Indian
 style where multiple competing political parties and religious
beliefs can coexist without conflict or bad
 blood, this fellow was attending the talk.

Then he said that he just turned up and that the next talk was going
to be on Postgres.

He actually ended up there to take photographs of his friend.

In the course of conversation I got to know the scoop. Oracle paid 15
lakhs for the conference. And mySQL
 was what they were talking about ;perhaps they could have talked about ZFS.

Since I happen to know the inner realities of databases, their history
and as most of  my hair has turned grey
 I got a deeper insight into the situation.

Postgresql is a BSD licensed piece of software with no strings
attached. It is built on processes and not threads
 like mySQL.

And I wonder how one can talk about mySQL in that many tracks as there
is really not much to talk about.

This also reminded me how in Madurai Redhat came and spoke in an open
source NASSCOM expo.

How did Redhat become 1 billion company if it were that keen on open source?

Politics aside sponsorships give us some really entertaining situations. ;)

Mele A1000 or A2000 is low cost board. It has everything except keyboard,
display. It is not a tablet but can be used as a small computer (with VGA
monitor, TV). It seems to be portable.

Modding the flash in these devices are doable, but with risks of bricking
the device etc. If you are into DIY, then a good place to start are with
these devices:

I tried this kiscsiadm which is not good enough. It has some library
dependency which is not available in ubuntu repository. I manually
downloaded and installed the library package libdb4.3 and the libdb4.3-dev.

After the installation I can't able to see the application.

Is there any other tool apart from this.

There is a difference between Opinion and Facts. You haven't quoted any
Facts in here,
and hence i presume you should have tagged this as 'Opinion'.

It is much better to say that X is better than Y due to A, B, C and let the
group discuss
about the intricacies.

This one is just a blunt thought.

It would have been nice if you had mentioned so in your OP [1].
Members can then suggest alternate solutions to resolve your specific
problem.

If you have access to Virtual Box or Linux KVM, you can install a
"legacy" version of any distro with KDE 3.5 in the Guest OS and try it
out.

For such things I am a command line guy.    Over the years, on a few
occasions, the GUI wrapper (because of bugs) has failed wherein the
CLI worked fine.

Any particular reason for not wanting to use the CLI tools?

Hi Arun,

My apologizes for the incomplete communication.

The problem I am going for GUI, when I try to run the command iscsiadm -m
discovery -p X.X.X.X:3260 -I iface iqn.2011-03.freenas.local:target1, it is
not authenticated with the ISCSI target server. The output is

# BEGIN RECORD 2.0-871
discovery.startup = manual
discovery.type = sendtargets
discovery.sendtargets.address = X.X.X.X
discovery.sendtargets.port = 3260
discovery.sendtargets.auth.authmethod = None
discovery.sendtargets.auth.username = <empty>
discovery.sendtargets.auth.password = <empty>
discovery.sendtargets.auth.username_in = <empty>
discovery.sendtargets.auth.password_in = <empty>
discovery.sendtargets.timeo.login_timeout = 15
discovery.sendtargets.reopen_max = 5
discovery.sendtargets.timeo.auth_timeout = 45
discovery.sendtargets.timeo.active_timeout = 30
discovery.sendtargets.iscsi.MaxRecvDataSegmentLength = 32768
# END RECORD

I also added the chap username and password in the iscsi.conf available in
the /etc folder. Same above output is the result.

And also I run the command  "iscsiadm -m node --targetname
"iqn.2011-03.freenas.local:target1" --portal "X.X.X.X:3260" --login" where
it says "iscsiadm: no records found!"

I think any cheap chinese allwinner A10/A13 based tablet can be tinkered to
run a linux based distro.
See https://github.com/linux-sunxi  and
http://rhombus-tech.net/allwinner_a10/
Not sure if you can run puppy linux though since they don't seem to provide
arm distro. But you can use
yocto to get a root file system image for ARM combined with the kernel and
boot tools from linux-sunxi repos.

Try ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=keyboard-interactive -o
PubkeyAuthentication=no -p 2500 xx.yy.zz.44
It will not try the publickey authentication at all and prefer password.
But, this is a workaround, you should find the actual problem. Maybe
it's to do with the fact that you have DSA key and your server isn't
configured to handle it and is expecting only RSA key.

If you have access to the server by other means check logs mainly auth.log to find out why server rejects/delays the connection.

These lines don't make sense if you have configured them in the conf

Way to go Postgresql.

I did not succeed in turning around the MSRTC ETIM project from the
stupid mysql to postgresql though I did succeed at other places as
they did not had the "damned" dba.

It would be a capital crime to choose mysql henceforth,
nothwithstanding my typos

What is it:

OpenArena is an open-source content package for ioQuake3 licensed

OpenArena is a free replacement for id Software Inc.'s Quake 3 Arena,
it is NOT compatible with the proprietary game!

OpenArena might be considered unsuitable for children.

This package installs the OpenArena client.

Hi Bala,

Please add ilugc to the cc list or use "reply to all". Your questions will
be helpful for others.

You can grab some OS book and start reading it to get the idea. You can
even start from wikipedia to get a glimpse of OS and can figure out if OS
interests you.

Thanks and Regards,
PrasannaKumar

Hi

vakilsearch.com is looking for a Ruby on Rails Rockstar to head its
technology team to build the backbone of India's largest online legal
services company (like legalzoom / rocketlawyer of the US). The challenge
is to build and package the product in a way that makes buying a
professional service - as simple as - buying a phone on flipkart.

If that sounds exciting and want to discuss the technology challenges that
need to be solved, please email me at hameed at vakilsearch dot com with a
brief summary of your experience and contact details.

If you'd like to have a quick chat over the phone, 76677 13366 is the
number to reach us. The chosen rockstar would be working closely with the
core team at vakilsearch.com's Chennai headquarters.


Regards

Hameed

In fact its hard. We here are finding lot of problems even getting a guy
who has heard about Ruby programming. When I say to engineers I know Rails,
they look at me with suspision. The problem is people just master tech that
will earn them quick buck rather than to love it and know it. That's why
hey end up  under horrible bosses who will pay them ans snatch their
freedom. All the best any way.

Subject: [Ilugc] some sockets
Message-ID: <CALDskyzZr82sbD7fXh8xxF2+5KUDPNxsaVw=-D+0bmgs0xA1UA@mail.gmail.com>

I was quite shocked to know that people I met in a recent conference
knew me whilst I did not. Due to
 ILUGC.

In fact it was quite embarrassing as I wish I knew them as well. If I
had any sense of ego or wish for
 fame then I could not have continued with ILUGC. I would have left
like everyone else who rise
like a volcano and die after the lava dries up every now and then.

Recently someone wanted to get some knowledge bytes. I have become
lazy now and I don't have much
 good cheer or mood to send tech mails with a lot of energy. Moreover
I have become old now with
 more than half my hair grey. One day I may also pass out like KG.
Strange are the ways of
Yama. So enjoy it while it lasts.

My fervent wish is to see more techies in LUG and hopefully with
better social habits than myself.

Let us get to the tech part now.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A TCP or UDP or UNIX domain socket is an endpoint in an inter process
communication.

In the case of UNIX domain sockets it is between two processes in the
same host. Often it is used
 to talk between userland and kernel though more commonly it is used
to communicate with a
 daemon from a management interface.

A network socket however  is meant to talk to a remote process. In
fact sockets are not only
 a way to talk to remote processes , it also is the standard way of
communication on the Internet.
So much so that email or web or chat would not work without sockets.

So this has a lot of parallel with the electrical socket but then
there are plenty of differences.

Every TCP or UDP socket is full duplex. It has ability to send and
receive data simultaneously.

Although at a physical level, say ethernet or WiFi or something this
is not possible. CSMA/CD or
CSMA/CA only allows bits to flow in one direction. But sockets are at layer IV.

There are also raw IP sockets at layer III in which you can broadcast
and you have to build
 your own TCP and UDP Checksum. I have not had to mess around with them.

User domain sockets easily used from a perl or python or C code is fun
and a lot of useful
applications can be developed with them.

If you combine socat and netcat you can do some really amazing things with it.

lua is another cool language with this ability.

One of these days we will see some nice code to play with sockets.

Learning a programming language is fun if you start with sockets. The
utility of sockets are
 so high and of practical use that this will keep you engaged sparing
you the boredom and
 effort of knowledge acquisition.

I remember how chatting with netcat became a hit with girls sitting
close to each other
 in a UNIX training I did long ago.

Zim is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wikipages

Each page can contain links to other pages, simple formatting  and inline
images.
Pages are stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and can have
attachments.
creating a new page is easy as linking to a nonexistent page.

All data is stored in plain text files with wiki formatting. various
plugins provide additional
functionality, like a task list manager, an equation editor, a tray icon,
and support for version
control.

zim can be used to:


   - keep an archive of notes
   - Take notes during meetings or lectures
   - Organize task lists
   - Draft blog entries and emails
   - Do brainstorming

Minix is long dead. Nobody uses it.It was a college experiment.

Do some hacking elsewhere.

Don't waste time beating dead horse and find out uncompetitive areas like some
 companies do.

They want to focus on African markets, South America and colleges. I now know
why. They are afraid of competing with the best talent.

Death is better than such unfounded fear.

 this experiment  brought us the linux and why we are here because of
minix.

 There are no developers in minix to support yet.If you not interested,
keep it yourself.Dont blame if others do.

It is a research project kind. If some thing is not in practical use it
does not mean it is dead. You can think of research in physics,
mathematics, string theory etc etc. If you were correct people will say
doing research in mathematics is junk but I think no one is saying so.

Minix project was provided with some 2.5million euros of funding some years
ago and 1million euros before that. If people are ready to provide *so*
much money then there must be something really good going on.

    Can you explain why it is a waste of time ? Do you think there is
nothing that could be learnt from it ? In what detail have you looked
at the Minix source code to conclude that it is a waste of time to
contribute to that ?

There are still people who contribute to proejcts from 70's and 80's,
just for fun. Likewise, this is done for fun as well. If you don't
like Minix, leave it at that. Please do not discourage good work done
by someone.

       Minix was a pet project of AST, intended at helping college
students. It doesn't matter whether its focus is on African markets or
Asian markets. There are a lot of things that college students can
gain from Minix.

if you are trying to write any Tamil article, using this word,
use the same word - command line - in Tamil too.

as this is noun, no need for translation.

if your name is raja, English people Will call you as raja only. not as
king.

just my thoughts.

Found the reason, it is because of egress policy filtering at the local end

Message-ID: <CALDskyx+ExoSDP_gyKSNY6XfbFp48-PdaQM8G0ft=1bok0cGcw@mail.gmail.com>

Okay some crypto now.

Cryptography is the art and science of concealing information in such
a manner as to defeat
 compromise.

A security compromise could be losing your Paypal account and some
cash or losing your
 email ID to someone or some useless files on your desktop computer.

Crypto cannot address every security problem just like jogging cannot
prevent common cold.

Crypto has a goal specific to encryption, authentication and
integrity. Which is it allows you
 to identify who you are, protect your privacy and also ensure that
the communication is
 not tampered with.

Let us turn to Internet banking.

I was slow to wake up to it. But now I pay my rent, phone bill, EB
bill and even get my cash from
clients using net banking.

Of course paypal is not a bank but I can withdraw from it to my SBI account.

ICICI has done a truly fantastic job of securing online banking. Now
SBI also has a very secure portal.

Over a long usage period I can say that these two services have been
very satisfactory.

But since poor Girish does not make much money I have never stress
tested this. ;)

Jokes aside now let us turn to the technology.

First thing is that TLS v1 or SSL3 which is a bug fixed or a security
enhanced version of SSL2 which had
 lot of attacks exposed by cryptanalysts is the basis of all Internet
banking sites.

Your username and password goes encrypted and your session which is if
you are transferring funds,
 that is also encrypted.

There is a problem called replay. In which the packets though
encrypted can be used to carry out a double
transfer or even authenticate you again.

These are all old known problems and there are multiple ways to guard
against that. From crypto math
 we know that nonce is the technique used to safeguard against this issue.

There is a very interesting topic called zero knowledge proof which is
proving that you know something
  without actually revealing the secret.

This has very interesting applications in practical life. Usually this
is used in authentication.

And using several forms of identification like sending an SMS to the
mobile,using the data on your ICICI
 debit card grid and so on add to the security since multiple layers
of security ensure higher protection.

But security always comes with an expense and if you make things too
hard and boring for people
 then something like net banking used by millions with different
technical abilities will not work well.

Let us even study the case of the ATM machine and the ATM plastic and
the magnetic strip itself.

I think ATM kiosks communicate with a central server using satellite
microwave communication.

And they keep a log of the cash dispensed. Once I did not get cash but
amount was debited from my
account.

I complained and they fixed it by end of the day tallying.

So ultimately security is only useful if applied in a practical context.

-Girish

Sundaram, how about you provide the technical snippets with detail examples and work-flows of the entire operation. Let see how good your post can be .....seriously man this is a community don't you ever think about the newbies!!

Those are the four tiers of support offered by IT technicians. Each level
having more experience and education with computers. Some IT departments
have less tiers, but generally there are four. (The L would be for Level.)
It could generally apply to any form of technical support.

Any problem first come to L1, if can not be solved then goes to L2 and so
on.

So basically L3 is solving major issues.

Subject: [Ilugc] Linux DC++ going berserk in RAM usage
Message-ID: <CAOjpnk_UxkcK8OYLBk7mz08mnFzntP6RgDjWdCDEFSdamF+Y+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
      I am using ubuntu linux for around 6 months now. I am using Linux
DC++ to share and download files directly in the LAN.

     Of late, (From yesterday) Linux DC++ is taking up the whole RAM for a
minute(!!) to just connect to the hubs and retrieve the users list. Not
only that, it is eating the RAM space occasionally even when idle, for
almost two full minutes.During these periods, the DC++ window is dulled and
system lags a little.
Can someone help me out with the reason of this problem and how i can solve
it ?

And, btw, my system is running Ubuntu 12.04 on a 1.75 GB RAM, intel pentium
4 desktop.
Also, this is the first instance of such problems.

Thanks,
Jhana

Hi Girish,

One small doubt, why is it that your text appears to be broken on g-mail ?
That is there is a line feed in unwanted places.  Are others seeing the
same ?

Subject: [Ilugc] how irctc works
Message-ID: <CALDskywM93f_xtr1LOkAp=0hJ8qeVtz5yETEzrJHtD6p73-dMQ@mail.gmail.com>

irctc is the site I use for booking train tickets.

Mostly tatkal but sometimes even general ticket.

The site is designed by a crazy fellow like myself since it uses old
CGI technology,
 thereby being conservative and smart it delivers value where
something like RoR
 or some perl or python framework would have failed miserably.

Because it was designed from first principles recognizing the load it
is expected to
 handle it does remarkably well though the Tatkal issue was sorted out recently
 by shifting the time from 8 am to 10 am.

Anyway this is a classic example of database locking, concurrent
access and other
ACID semantics.

At the same time the railway clerks in counters are accessing the DB,
you are accessing
 either from India or abroad and still everyone is accessing the same
DB and booking
 the same seats in trains.

This also has to accomplish crypto in a small way since the protocol
between multiple
 payment gateways for collecting money has to be secure and trustworthy.

What is a payment gateway?

It is a standard protocol/mechanism for others to access financial
information for the purpose
 of fund transfer/payment. Think of this as the protocol between
multiple ATM kiosks run
 by different banks.

How does the business model work? Why will you run a God forsaken bank's ATM if
everyone comes to your ATM to withdraw from their ICICI account?

Obviously there has to be some commission or payback for complying with the
 payment gateway protocol.

Anyway when you book a ticket in irctc and are ready to purchase the
ticket control is passed
 in programming speak from the train reservation site to the bank and
then back. One has to
 ensure that information is appropriately transmitted.

Zero knowledge proofs I discussed yesterday comes into force.

irctc is not bothered about your net banking password. It only needs
to know whether the ticket
 is paid for.

There are also other complications to consider. Since there are
multiple steps involved in getting
 a ticket transaction can fail at any point; and you can lose net or
better still power can go.

How to handle this?

And sometimes in spite of everything being there the transaction
itself will fail.

Who will reimburse you? The bank? Or Irctc?

As you can see the design of a software system involves a lot of
technical and real life complexities.

       Delivers value ? I have been using it regularly for a long
time. And I can tell you - It is among the worst piece of crap I have
ever used.  Here is some information - no inferences, just info.

1) It uses MS IIS 6.0, and probably ASP.NET. This sends the weirdest
of HTTP responses - Some 6XX that I have no idea about.
2) It randomly intentionally logs people out saying they either
double-clicked or clicked refresh, when all they do is stare at the
screen.
3) They timeout a lot during the tatkal hours, esp. on Thursdays,
Fridays and Saturdays.(Right now, its about 10:25 - people can telnet
to irctc.co.in  port 80 a few times and check for themselves.)

I haven't used it much, must all my friends say its total crap. he fail
rate below 40% is just misleading. I can say for sure about that. Mostly
one must try at least 3 times to get a successful booking.

the railways must reform itself, beef up its system for high loads.

IRCTC is not designed for high loads. It does not scale well. I guess there
is no proper infrastructure. Install wappalyzer addon in firefox - it shows
IIS Server is being used for IRCTC. The money for maintenance, software
update and OS everything boils down to the user (as charges being put on
the user). If IRCTC had had used Linux (or LAMP) it would have been able to
save a huge amount of money I could say.

Thank God the counters in the station use dumb terminals and Unix (?). If Railways had chosen to go with DOS or Windows for the counters, it would've been a huge catastrophe.

I remember reading about some higher official in Railways quoted
saying that they have not scaled up their systems and the website to
handle high loads as it would deprive all those rural people booking
tickets from stations. :-/

Btw, isn't this discussion going OT?

Subject: [Ilugc] some perl hacks
Message-ID: <CALDskywEOA9nq6Y6+tVLGWcD9nEOxD3nLEs9aSyUTuRbJ9Z04Q@mail.gmail.com>

1)

$ cat i.pl
for(<>) {
        print uc;
}

This is a simple tr(1) implementation.

These two lines and a closing brace do what tr does to
translate from lower case to upper case.

You run like this

$ perl i.pl
foo just trying
<ctrl-d>

You will get upper case results.

2)

$ cat i.pl
for(<>) {
        print if /peter/;
}

Use same technique for running. You will only get lines that contain peter.

Now the / / operator is actually a regex match pattern in perl.

You can match for literal words like above or actually regex classes
like digits like this:

3)

$ cat i.pl
for(<>) {
        print if /\d/;
}


Now you will get lines that contain digits 0 to 9. This also will work.

print if /[0-9/;

Another interesting sample.

4)
$ cat i.pl
for(<>) {
        print $& if /\d+/;
}

This not only prints the match but also matches multiple digits.

That is what \d+ does.

regex is a complex topic and all perl code you find will go through a
file line by line and look for matches.

So remember the diamond operator <> for reading a file line by line and
 the regex match / / operator.

You can easily do an if else condition match and execute code in perl using
 regexes.

This finds plenty of practical use.

I will come up with some practical instances tomorrow.

Hi,

I am experiencing a problem with my Seagate 1TB usb external harddisk.
When I try to connect to my Ubuntu 12.04, it is not getting detected.
I see the following messages in syslog.

At this point, the system tries to spinup the disk, but the usb
eventually disconnects.

Hard disk does not get detected in Fedora 16 as well.

Has anyone faced this issue ?
Could anyone direct me to any usb debug software in Linux?

Thanks

A few answers might help us narrow down the issue:

1. Did it behave like this from day 1 or after some usage?
2. Is it attached to a laptop or a desktop?
3. Have you tweaked any power saving mode in the BIOS and/or the
desktop settings?

Could be a power issue. In my desktop, my USB hard disk works if it is
connected to the rear (MB) usb connectors. If I connect it to the front
panel connectors, the light in the hard disk will glow but not spin up.

Hello all,

The Wikimedia Language Engineering team[1] invites Indic wikipedians and
people who are interested in language support for their wikiprojects for a
meetup with us. Language teams are Wikimedia community members with a
common interest (compare with SIG) to help improve, provide feedback and
help educate our language communities of readers and editors about
Wikimedia software enhancements and tools built by the langauge engineering
team. This meetup is to get a face-to-face introduction to language
technologies available on the Wikimedia websites and learn more about how
to best use these. We will be in Pune[2] on the 4th November and
Bangalore[3] on 11th November. (For a change a Bangalore Wikimeetup can be
held in a different part of city :)). Please sign up on the page, looking
forward to meeting you and working together on improving language support :)

Message-ID: <CALV9omZphbg-O2C1M7Pcyo3yjnK=CbJmECJ04PmA+sOAKiaPqw@mail.gmail.com>

Tool of the Day: Gip IP Address Calculator

 Gip is an application for making IP address based calculations.
 For example, it can display IP addresses in binary format. It is also
 possible to calculate subnets.

Gip provides system administrators with tools for IP address based
calculations.
For example, an administrator who needs to find out which IP prefix length
equals
the IP netmask 255.255.240.0, just types in the mask and gets  the prefix
length
presented.But Many more advanced calculations can be made. Gip can convert
an address range into a list of prefix lengths. It can also splits subnets
using a given
IP netmask or IP prefix length. Many more calculations are possible.

current version:  gip 1.7.0-1-3
size: 1.2 MB to download, 5.7 MB when installed

for more details: http://code.google.com/p/gip/

#1 How are you providing power to the laptop? Explain your setup.

#2 As the log (Read Capacity) mentions, the USB gets disconnected when
system tries to read the disk capacity. Can you try re-connecting the
external disk, say five times, and see if it fails at this same
instant?

#3 You could try to use a different cable and see if it isn't a cable problem.

#4 You haven't mentioned which laptop you are using. If the USB cable
is for USB 3.0, then make sure you plug it in the USB 3.0 port.

Hi Thala,

I am using Airtel fixedline broadband connection. I went with the WiFi
modem they gave (Beetel - 450TC1 - ADSL2 + Router).

They said since March 2012 they are imposing secure WiFi and provide
software only for Windows and Mac. What this means is that Linux devices,
iOS / Android tabs / phones can't use the Wifi. I guess there is a limit to
the nmber of systems that can use the Wifi at the same time too.

I need a way to use the Wifi in my Ubuntu 12.04 laptop and Android 4.1
phone.

Ravi

Subject: [Ilugc] some socket code with perl
Message-ID: <CALDskyw2b18iTgvthAf2WZFOR0dutjGKN0UPFBjwoLG8dhdZ+w@mail.gmail.com>

I have some perl code but a short intro to sockets.

There are TCP, UDP and UNIX domain sockets.

Most of the communication happens using TCP, be it web or mail or FTP.
UDP is used for
voice, time synchronization, broadcast and so on.

Be good with TCP sockets and you are fine.

Also TCP sockets are asymmetric. The server is very different from client.

TCP is connection oriented, session based. It maintains several states
in client and server in transport layer.

The kernel maintains TCP state machine and establishment and closure
involves several states, FIN_WAIT, CLOSE_WAIT
 and so on.

Most importantly from the coding angle a server in TCP has an ability
to accept multiple TCP connections but a client
 can only talk to one server.

And each TCP socket can only talk to one peer be it client or server.

It will get more and more boring, so let us look at code instead. ;)

-----------------

1) cat client.pl
use IO::Socket::INET;

$sock = IO::Socket::INET->new(PeerAddr=> 'localhost:1234');

print $sock "how are you";

close $sock;

This is a simple TCP client program in perl.

You start netcat like this:

$ nc -l -p 1234

and you can see this msg printed.

You can create a simple TCP server in perl,

2)
use IO::Socket::INET;

$sock = IO::Socket::INET->new(Listen  => 5,
                                LocalPort => 1234,
                                Proto => 'tcp');

$acc = $sock->accept();
while(<$acc>) {
        print;
        print $acc $_;
}

close ($acc);
close ($sock);

This will simply echo the stuff you type with,

$ nc -v localhost 1234

client.

Even in Tcl, expect, python and several other languages this can be done.

Instead of netcat you can use socat also.

One of these days we will look at socat's magic too.

It is an amazing project.

Mind blowing.

If security settings are on the modem, what stops him from logging into the
modem's admin interface and changing them?

For anything more, he will need to tell us more about what kind of security
have they put in place. I recently had trouble with wpa2 enterprise
security setup that network manager (on debian) and android 4.1 could not
handle.

Could be. Your lappie usb ports may not be able to sustain the current
draw by the hard disk.   BTW, is the lappie running on battery *or*
power?

Some devices come with a Y USB cable wherein there are two USB
connectors that go into two USB ports on the system.  The extra
connector is for additional power draw (I have an external DVD Writer
with such a cable).    Do you have such a contraption?

I suspect power issues or some intermittent hardware failure in the
external disk system.

I have had dry solder problem with a branded external disk drive case,
when connected it exhibited symptom similar to your experience.

Connect the disk to other systems  (if you have access), use the on
board USB ports.   See if the problem manifests.

To my knowledge this security model would have to be enforced by the
AP point built into the device *and* follow open standards like WEP,
WPA, WPA2 PSK or Enterprise.

The Airtel chap gave your friend a nice smoke and mirror logic.

Hog wash -- assuming the device supports open standards WEP, WPA, WPA2
(PSK or Enterprise)

Assuming your friend had the foresight to extract the admin password
to the Airtel device,  there is nothing preventing your friend from
disabling the WiFi functionality in the Airtel device and connecting
his own AP and give access to any of his machines.   Of course your
friend must make sure that he is using WPA2 PSK with a *strong* pass
phrase for the Pre Shared Key (PSK).

I think the above phrase was replaced by " Your wish, our command ". There
was some severe debate over the phrase  on windows in google + and once
some senior Ubuntu person noticed the critics it was changed.

Unless your app needs write permission (very seldom) 550 should be
sufficient.   The dir and file ownership/group s/b the uid/gid for
apaches as defined in CentOS.

Check for User and Group definitions in the apache configuration. Make sure
that this user/group has access to the folder in question.

Thanks for the clarification.

Finally was able to fix it after a call with the customer support.
When we got the connetion 6 months back they said all these rules but
now it seems they have revoked everything and things are back to
normal.

Tool of the Day: Graphical Disk Map

Display disk space using tree maps
 GdMap is a tool which allows to visualize disk space. It shows why our
 hard disk is full or what directory and files take up most of the space?
 With GdMap these questions can be answered quickly. To display directory
 structures cushion treemaps are used which visualize a complete folder or
 even the whole hard drive with one picture.

 Cushion treemaps display directories and files in rectangular areas. The
larger a
 file is the larger is the rectangle which represents it. All files in one
directory are
 painted within the rectangle of that directory.

version: gdmap 0.8.1-2
size: 53.2 kB to download, 335.9 kB when installed

Hi Dinesh,

Please always provide reproducible steps with your problem statement. It
will get you quick response from list.

1). what are you doing while getting the permission problem?

Note : It seems SELinux security context is enabled in the server.

Thanks

In your CentOS 6.3, temporarily disable SELinux using

setenforce 0

and try accessing  the '/folder'

Subject: [Ilugc] ISP load balancing
Message-ID: <CALDskyxp+O9gPs--ZTLCb5-k56Vu6nDZZsFKToXo_2D6jxKc=A@mail.gmail.com>

Normally an office or home has one Internet connection.

With data card and laptops and cheap access to Internet nowadays having
 more than one connection to the Internet is becoming increasingly common.

Some businesses like share trading and Internet based businesses are
increasingly
 dependent on having stable uptime of their net connectivity.

In order to ensure this companies normally purchase a UTM with that
capability. It is a
 hardware appliance that can take care of multiple Internet lines with
different providers
 and different IP blocks and ensure that traffic gets shared between
the links with
failover capacity.

In certain situations where a UTM is missing this capability can be
provided by devices that
 specifically cater to this need.

How this is done is actually not standard. There are multiple ways to
achieve this goal.

Equal cost multipath routing is one. called as ECMP. You have two
default routes.

You could do it using firewall rules. You could do it using different
other ways.

But there is a lot of confusion in the marketplace about what to expect.

Will you magically get the sum of the bandwidths if you aggregate the
links in a single download?

What about upload?

And will fail over happen for live connections like a skype talk?

And companies have varying needs too. Some businesses are happy with
an ability to use
 both links and do basic fail over.

Some companies require real aggregation that is beyond the laws of
physics and law of nature.

I feel that we are in the same state that we were when ISDN came and
we wondered how
 voice and data can be carried on the same copper pair.

777 is a *no* *no*

Please take time to read other posts in the thread.  This has already

ZaTab :ZaREason's Open Tablet-

Kevin Bush, Linux Journal has reported about this tablet which is currently
running (or install) Cyanogenmod 9 Android 4.04.Means by default its a
rooted device.

The author mentioned in the article -

"This is the ideal device for Android developers or Linux developers
looking to shoehorn a traditional Linux distribution onto a tablet. There
is a good chance you will see a full Linux distro running on the ZaTab in
the future. ZaTabs are in the hands of KDE and Edubuntu developers, and
surely on the wish lists of many other free software developers out there."

Subject: [Ilugc] some shell counters
Message-ID: <CALDskywdQRJz3qL+6oq=ne_ZpNO2CRRnTiNw3-bLW1otO7pRJQ@mail.gmail.com>

We cannot do sockets programming with shell script since sockets
require a networking
 library and shells do not have any libraries. But we can obviously
invoke netcat and
socat or any other software using shell scripts but we cannot do low
level socket
operations with shell scripts. Low level operations like closing
sockets, accepting a socket,
 reading and writing a certain number of bytes etc. can't be done.

In fact even higher level scripting languages do not permit much control.

But shell scripts are very powerful for many common applications like
say simple counters.

In OpenBSD I use jot. In Linux you use something like rs or seq.

$ cat s.sh
for s in `jot 100 1 100`
do
        print $s
done

This will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100. One each line.

Instead of this you could do something 100 times. For instance, invoke
the fortune
 command 100 times for getting 100 random fortune cookies.

$ cat s.sh
for s in `jot 100 1 100`
do
        #print $s
        fortune
done

You can do some cool things with randtype, cowsay, fortune or any such
nice game,
 sleep and jot.

Look at this creative attempt.
$ cat f.sh
for f in `jot 10 3 1`
do
        sleep 3
        print "World is ending... $f"
done

print "Now go back to work"

You have lot of useful tools in the UNIX shell that can enthuse
learners to fall in love and
 thereby smoothen their painful learning curve.

Apropos of curves that reminds me something else.;)

We can do socket programming in bash but yes we cannot do fine grained control

I am not familiar with jot. But if it is just printing 1 to 100 in one line each 
, you could do it the bash way , like
$ cat i.sh
for i in {1..100}
do
echo $i
done

Message-ID: <CA+MGHirK_DUt6wi1z3=-Tpkq0xcvtbC22T_waZ5b0GEK1uENrA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Gmane is a awesome cool thing. It gives you cool view types. You can
use the flat blog type interface with threads and then there is the
frames and threads. Both the ways are cool in their own ways. Allows
you to read more mail quickly than you can usually do with your
regular mail client like gmail. I see that about 80 % of ilugc
memebers are gmail users. But digging older mails is better done in
gmail. But i dont think anybody will be interested in replying to a
very old thread. So i tried posting from gmane and it works. But a few
gotcha. You need to be subscribed to ilugc in order to post via gmane.
If you are posting from gmane for the first time, it sends you a mail
with instructions on how to subscribe to ilugc, which is crap for me.
All you have to do is to reply to the mail. Just reply and doesn't
require anything more in subject or body. It is a cryptic to email
address and make sure you dont touch the to address. Once you reply
you become authorised to post in gmane and gmane will post the reply
to ilugc on your behalf and you should be able to see your mail in
ilugc in 10 mins from authorisation. Note authorisation is one time
thing and ofcourse you dont need to authorise everytime. Which would
them defeat the very purpose of replying in gmane. One advantage of
replying in gmane is gmane is good at handling mailing list mail than
you filters in mail client. So off i go to set my mail as nomail
option and read, reply from gmane.

with regards,
ashwin

Laptop was on ac power. I tried in desktops also. Ubuntu, Fedora and

Hi all,

Slightly off topic depending on how we perceive this.
Posting this here as I assume most Free Software people will be opposed to surveillance as a matter of principle. I am sure most people on this forum are familiar with Dr. Stallman's views on surveillance, facebook and mobile phones.

Though the stated objectives of Aadhar is improving govt. delivery efficiency and fighting corruption, in reality it is also enabling a massive surveillance structure over all Indian residents.
I think there some free software / open source components to the Aadhar project and in my opinion that is an irony.


Mr. Matthew Thomas and his team have started a legal battle against Aadhar. They are using RTI and courts to unravel the facts and publicise the truth.
Apart from my other contributions, I am trying to do my bit in trying to raise support for it.


You may find more here: http://www.thefifthestateworld.com/

Here is a gist of Mr. Thomas's appeal in his own words:
>"What we need is people to 
analyse the UID scheme and take appropriate decisions. They should not 
be carried away by the media image or political affiliations of the 
prime-movers of the >project.?

>People who understand the dangers of UID could contribute by taking the 
message through any media they have an opportunity to bring out the 
truth.

>I request you to email, suggesting to the community to 
register on the website, post articles, news, blogs, mails to MPs, CMs, 
post comments on news, like the one on 'IBN Live' today. >They could 
promote the website.

>Please post your comments on the lies he is saying. He said that the trials 
for LPG delivery is successful. Reply to my RTI query on this is that 
the trial is NOT complete.

>I have two Google groups, one called 'Citizens Action Forum' and the 
other called, 'UID - India's Orwell'. They could register on these 
groups and post there too. "

If you care about this cause, please register on the sites and the forums. If you think other lugs across India will be interested, please do spread the word on those forums too.

Thanks and Best Regards

Your counter example is good, I tried. It worked in bash.

ksh, public ksh called as pdksh is the best shell.

Your socket example however is not very useful. Better to use
 perl or python or lua for sockets.

Thanks.

Hi,

I want to gauge my 6 year old daughter's interest in programming. She seems
fascinated with what I do... If she is interested, I would like to
introduce her to the joy of programming. Any recommendations for a first
programming language? My first choice would be BASIC with which I learnt
programming some 24 years back. Any better choices? A language which will
be a foundation for her to explore and make better choices later and
a language which is not imposing and is fun?

Great!  I also started with BASIC (GWBASIC).

In my opinion, "python" is a decent, good first choice to introduce to
children (very basic python is enough considering her age).

YYMMV.

    This is a tough question, because most of us program with the
language that we use, because it is fun :) Having said that, python
would be really nice. You can use the interpreter, and do everything
from 1+1 and print "Hello" to somewhat complex stuff.

Another option(given that she is just 6 years) might be LOGO(KTurtle ?
) with which kids can draw alphabets, small diagrams etc and will be
fun. Thanks

Have seen posts from parents online who started the kids with Scratch and
then moved to pygame. Kids seem to love these :-)

For my son who is in ICSE school, they taught him Scratch and Alice when he was 7. Both these 'free' software packages are very good first languages for kids - they are fun, easy to learn and very powerful programming concepts can be taught. 





After 8 to 9 years, I have started with BASIC and he is fascinated by what he can do with that. Although many people say Python is better than BASIC I am not convinced. Indentation is not for kids. Simple GOTO constructs are far more powerful for learning. 




YMMV

Teach Scratch. If possible buy a raspberrypi and teach scratch or just use
your system for using scratch. It is like drag and drop (not only GUI but
code also). It will instill real skills not just learning some coding
syntax and using it.

Hope this helps,

I've heard good things about Scratch.  Why not try some of the
suggestions and tell us how it went.

In an attempt to induce my then 10-year old niece to learn programming, I
did some research, and got a copy of Squeak -
http://www.squeak.org/Unfortunately the DVD lay unused for a long
time, and she eventually lost
it without having tried it even once. So I can't speak for its
effectiveness.

Anyway, the project appeared highly promising. You should definitely check
it out and compare against other options.

I see many of my friends have internet connection in office and home,
spending time on social networks.

Often, they realise that they waste time and worry for not doing
anything useful.

Thinking of collecting some list of small tasks to contribute to Free
Software in any way.

some tasks are

1. write article on wikipedia
2. write review on any free software on their blog

Reply with such tasks, so that we can create more contributors.

Let us change the internet consumers as contributors.

Thanks.

Hi all,

This Question may seem to be funny or non conventional for many but, I am
looking for a solution for this for a long time...

I have a good music library in my computer (running under Ubuntu 12.04).
The library consists of a huge collection of songs. Most of the songs have
the properties of the singer, music director, etc.

Now, I wish NOT TO HEAR (or rather filter out) the songs sung by/ directed
by some person.  Is there anyway out?

As of now, I manually skip the songs when it comes for play.

I use either Banshee or Rhythm Box!

P.S:  I just want to filter them out.. Not delete them

Sorry if I am talking very much out of topic...

As a child of age 6, I would recommend her to learn the worldly languages
(A few of them excluding what is being taught in schools)..
I wish that she must learn the very BASIC language to express her
thoughts.. I mean her mother tongue!!
Let her learn to program herself to adapt with the world, to interact with
the people and to deal with them!
Let her learn the art of programming to express her views in a nice, sweet
way!

I am sorry if I had replied too much out of topic!

I assume library, means your music player indexed all your songs.

Do you create a playlist or have a playlist? or you hear the songs
randomely from the library (in other words from the index)?

Not sure about banshee or Rhythm box having a plugin, but I can do the
following steps if I'm in your position,

1. traverse the directories where you have your mp3 files.

2. for each file, generate a line with following data.

	filepath,composer,singer,moviename

 There is a package called id3lib (http://id3lib.sourceforge.net
currently this site is not available, but major distros provides id3lib
package). It contains tools(id3v2, id3info id3convert etc.,) to extract
the singer,composer and lot of id3v2 tag information from mp3 files.

3. use 'grep' to remove the lines which have the person name I don't
like.

4. take out the filepath using 'cut'.

5. give it to my preferred music player as a playlist.

May be you can try writing a plugin for banshee using id3lib, its a c++
lib capable of editing mp3 tags. I use it mostly to remove crap posters
from mp3 files.

Thanks,
Mohan R

Currently we are in the process of setting up 100+ FOSS Labs in the
Coimbatore and surrounding region in the next 6 months.  If your
friends (especially freshers and not currently employed) are
interested in physically volunteering the efforts, they can join me.

Hopeless and useless questions. I have two sons aged 20 and 18 and
both are from CBSE Schools (Which prompted me to write one chapter on
CBSE-065 or something)

Both dont want to program anything. One wants a high=end WS for
64studio other uses a laptop with w7(shame on me) for chatting

Get them android and spoil them meticulously.

Khan Academy has started a CS stream. I have not looked into it entirely so
am not sure how appropriate it will be for a 6 year old. But I think it
should be good because John Resig (of jQuery) is implementing Bret Victor's
ideas of an interactive programming environment to make programming fun.

Google's Blockly has just one maze which my 8 yr old learnt to solve in a
matter of minutes and lost interest after that. Unless they add more
exercises it is not useful.

Basically this illustrates how an array can hold different data types
in the same array.

All high level languages support this.

Higher level languages are weakly typed.

The @arr array contains numbers, string, an array reference/pointer,
[2,4,5] and a function reference.

By accessing each array element I am able to invoke not just nested
array but also
 call the function whose pointer is stored.

Hope you can follow...

Otherwise pick up a book on perl or browse online and learn.

Thanks to everyone who gave their inputs. I will go through the list of
options and keep the list posted about how it went. There seems to be an
interesting mix of options. Especially the remark between "GOTO" and
"Intended code" is interesting.

I finally found the solution for this problem. I disabled CHAP
authentication in freenas and tried to connect the lun in Ubuntu.

It works.

I am not sure why ubuntu is not supporting CHAP authentication.

My ubuntu version is 11.10

For a 6th standard, may be yes. For a 6 year old, definitely not. I've seen
it.

And I don't think (many people lest) a 6 year old can be fascinated by the
pleasure of coding. She just might be fascinated by what's happening in the
screen.

At that age, she should be given intelligent puzzles to solve. My manager's
3 year old has her own iPad with loads of apps made to improve kids'
thinking skills.

Instead of teaching a kid to write a+b program in BASIC, give her a tablet
or PC with kids apps that does the same thing in a kid-friendly way. :-)

I would say it depends on what you would call `coding`. Well I remember
incredible fascination when a 3 line BASIC program could generate
multiplication tables. I was 10 then and it was on a Spectrum ZX computer
connected to the TV.  What got me even more excited was assigning a sound
note to each key.

...and I assume a 6 year old today is way more informed/exposed/intelligent
than a 10 year old 25 years back :)

a+b is what the calculator does for her. I am sure printing her name or her
friend's name 10000 times on the screen is way more interesting.

And as a general reply, I am NOT trying to force my kid to do anything. I
have a feeling she might be good at it. So I want to gauge her interest and
if she likes it, I would provide the tools for her to pursue it. ...Before
the school curriculum in computing can spoil it forever.

I wish a lot more LUG members to follow this simple process so that
others on the 'Net can benefit from the question and the solution.

May be it is wishful thinking on my part.

No idea about workbench but finding

Seems to be a dead project.
Has it been revived somewhere else?

Thinking of starting a SMS service to provide OAOD/GNU/Linux Tips/Meeting info.

Is there any decent SMS service provider to send bulk sms?

What is the current SMS limit per day?

Is it possible to ask the mobile users subscribe themself for these service?

We tried sending SMS via USB dongle with sim card with gnokii.
http://www.slideshare.net/arulalan/sms-frame-work

But  can not scale much as it requires more manual work to send sms
and no auto subscription.

I think the limit on SMS per day from any number is 200, but please check
yourself.

Automation could be achieved using Gammu and Procmail.
You can setup mail filters using Procmail and use it to call gammu
scripts(to send sms).

If you need any assistance in setting up gammu or procmail, I will be glad
to help.

Subject: Copyright Office fails to protect users from DMCA

Link: http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management

The Copyright Office picked Sony over you; fails to expand DMCA
(http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management
) anti-circumvention exemptions to devices other than cell phones, or
to the sharing of anti-circumvention software.

The FSF has fought for years against the threat of Digital
Restrictions Management (DRM). Users should have the right to modify,
share and learn from the software on their devices, and technical
measures put in place in the name of DRM offer a substantial
roadblock. It's even worse when those measures have the force of
criminal law behind them, threatening people who simply want to change
the software on their computers with jail time. The FSF wants to
create a world in which there is no DRM. Until then, at the very
least, users shouldn't have to worry about legal consequences for
disabling these malfeatures on their own devices.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of course circumvents the
rights of users by making it illegal to modify your devices in ways
that would give you actual access to them, or to share tools to help
others do this. Congress did create one small carve-out from this
belligerence; that once every three years the Library of Congress (via
the Copyright Office), would consider making exceptions to this broad
rule. In 2010, the Office recommended exempting the freeing of
cellphones. They did not, however, make clear that this exemption
extended to people who distributed tools for freeing these devices. In
2012, we had hoped to expand the exempted class of uses, and
encouraged the Copyright Office to extend exemptions to tablets,
gaming consoles, and computers running restricted boot. We were on the
side of organizations like the EFF, and the Mozilla Foundation as well
as hundreds of other individuals calling for the protection of those
who simply want to be able to use their own devices in freedom.

But we were not the only ones to send recommendations to the Copyright
Office. Large corporations like Sony, and corporate-backed groups like
"Joint Creators and Copyright Holders" also sent comments opposing
these reasonable exemptions. And the Copyright Office fell for their
FUD. The Copyright Office has announced that while freeing your phone
in order to install your own software is still permitted, unlocking
the phone in order to switch carriers will be phased out. And even
that minimal remaining protection has not been extended to tablets.
Offering the duplicitous explanation that they weren't sure what a
tablet was, the office completely abdicated its responsibility to
protect users' rights to run their own software on their devices, as
well as their rights to works locked down on those tablets. They
similarly rejected exemptions for users wanting to install their own
operating system on game consoles, and even worse, failed to extend
protection to users who want to install their own operating system on
computers with restricted boot.

This means no longer being able to switch your own cell phone carrier
without permission. This means no modifying tablet operating systems
without legal threat. It means that trying to install a different
operating system on your game console could result in the FBI breaking
down your door. It means that you cannot even be sure of your right to
remove proprietary software from devices encumbered with restricted
boot.

The Copyright Office picked Sony over you. They had an opportunity to
protect users, but instead chose to protect corporate interests. This
is a terrible outcome for users everywhere, and just proves that we
need wholesale elimination of the anti-circumvention laws.

We need to band together. Here is what you can do to help:

Join our Boycott Sony campaign to let Sony know that this sort of
behavior is not acceptable.
Sign our statement to Stop Restricted Boot.
Donate to the Free Software Foundation to support our efforts to fight
bad laws like the DMCA.

Subject: [chennaipy 1449] October Meet Minutes
To: <chennaipy at googlegroups.com>

Hi Everyone,
we had a great meet this time, with about 10 people participating.

We started with the customary introduction to Python, since there were
lot of people who had just started with Python.

We then moved on to the "Classes and Methods" talk by
Rengaraj. Rengaraj demonstrated classes and objects by creating an
empty class called `Point`, instantiating it, and then adding members
to the object.

------

> class Point(object):
>>>
>> ...     pass

> p = Point()
>>> p.x = 10
>>> p.y = 20
>>>
>> ------

He then showed how to create a initialized object by defining the
`__init__()` method. He also explained the mandatory first argument,
which is used to pass the object itself. He then added another helper
method to calculate the distance of the point from the origin. One
question worth mentioning was raised by Gurpreet. He was surprised
that attributes get created by just assigning to them. He wanted to
know if this is good or bad? Vijay explained that the Python, unlike
languages like Java, doesn't constrain the developer too much. It
gives freedom to the developer, and the developer is supposed to use
freedom with responsibility.

We then moved on to the "Idioms and Anti-Idioms" talk by Vijay. Vijay
first explained an anti-idiom with module import. He explained why
`from module import *` is bad. He showed how that can overshadow
built-ins, local definitions and definitions from other modules. He
said the better way to do this is to explicitly specify the
definitions required from the module, as in `from module import x, y, z`

He then moved on to another anti-idiom with exceptions. He explained
why a blanket `try ... except` block, as shown below is bad.

------
try:
        fp = open(filename)
except:
        print "error opening file"
------

He showed what happened when the `open` function was misspelt, and how
it mattered more in Python, than in other languages like Java. He then
explained the right way to do it, is to explicitly specify the
exception to catch.

After the talks, Vijay wanted know anybody was interested in
giving a talk next meet. Arunram, Rengaraj and Gurpreet offered to
talk in the next meet. He also asked for suggestions, for Chennaipy,
and the following topics were suggested for the upcoming meets.

  1. GUI toolkits
  2. Socket programming
  3. Algorithm implementation

Vijay also suggested that we take up a small program, implement it and
then review the implementation during the next meet. He also suggested
that we could iterate this by adding more features. He said he will be
sending out a mail asking for suggestions on the program to implement.

Gurpreet, raised a question about doctest. He wanted to know if that
was good way of unit testing code. Vijay, put the audience to
perspective by telling them what docstrings are and what doctests
are. He then explained that doctests were used to ensure that the
documentation is in sync with the code, and not the other way
around. And that, it is not the best way to do unit testing.

With this, we came to the end of another wonderful Python meet.

Regards,
Vijay

Sir,
Thank you!!

I found the solution at last.
The problem was not in the CUPS or printer configuration.
*It was rather in Evince.*

In Evince, the print time was set to some fixed time by default. This held
the jobs from printing.
(I discovered this accidentally when a print, which was held and left
unnoticed,  came out when I switched on the System the next day).

 I searched the Options and changed it to "Print Now".
Now it is printing without any problem.

Thank you once again.

Depends on edition.
The community edition is under gnu-gpl.

It uses lgpl libraries and those may be used by non-free s/w.

The windows edition has proprietary dependencies and that is not good,
but by definition it is free s/w..

In addition to the above it is not clear whether the OP wanted to
initiate a discussion themed around aspects of the OS or, merely
wanted to pass across a collection of reviews. The latter is easily
done via <http://www.techmeme.com/search/query?q=Windows+8&wm=false>
for example.

Yes, somebody seems to have deleted/changed it. It is a wiki and the
history is not really public.

Anyway http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Windows_Error_Edition is not
so well written

You should not use phone for bulk SMS. As the SMS flows thru the
Signalling Channel of the GSM, it will take more time to deliver. To
speed up, you can use 5-10 phones to distribute and deliver the SMS.
Major issues, you cannot customize the FROM field and member may get
SMS from different numbers at different time.

Talcos may have HTTP, FTP, SMPP based service for the bulk SMS. Plz
talk to them.

Google search gives different links than sms.

Hi All,

             In my current company we have 500 employees working on windows
platform. we have planned to move to ubuntu for day to day use. we would
like to have an customized ubuntu iso which contains all the  required
packages like eclipse , qt and much more so that we can reduce the
repetitive installation  tasks. I am looking for some pointers , things to
note , links to how to articles on the following topic.

Creating customized ubuntu iso which contains all our development tools.
Creating an intranet repo server so that all the updates are served from
intranet.

Please share your experience and tips.

At our company we created a similar setup, we called it *ROSE* ( *Ruby's
Operating System for Enterprise* ). What we did was we installed all the
softwares commonly preferred, documentations of the languages and libraries
we used, tools like the ruby interpreter version 1.9.3 into a fresh system
and made a backup ISO of that system. The backup was generated using
http://www.geekconnection.org/remastersys/

One important thing you should keep note is that, it is hard to tell
everyone what all tools and facilities are available in the system. In our
case we solved this by setting the home page of firefox and google chrome
to an FAQ page on ROSE.

And to prevent the OS from downloading from the official ubuntu repo, we
removed the repositories that were in there, with link to our local server
which mirrored the Ubuntu repositories. In this central repo, we even added
provision to install the customized OS via LAN.

So far doing so have helped us reduce considerable bandwidth and increased
the productivity of the engineers as the commonly used documentation,
libraries and tools are already in the system being used.

Would be worthwhile exploring Landscape - released by Canonical with
12.10 meant precisely for this purpose. Combine it with the local repo
cache, I think you will be able to do what you want.

This seems to be a paid option. May not suit you if you want to do
this free of cost.

To: chennaiocc at googlegroups.com


CloudMint is looking for a Ruby on Rails developer with 1-2 years
experience. It will be helpful if you also know PHP. We are a services
company (for now) - we build custom applications for our clients. We
also work on some websites (in PHP and CakePHP).

The applicant must have a good understanding of:
- The entire Rails stack

We don't split responsibilities like larger companies. Add to that the
fact that our work is mostly from scratch beyond the basic framework
and a few admin-related gems. That means for example that knowing how
to use Devise will not be useful. You should have a grasp of how user
authentication works and the security implications and so on.

- HTML, CSS (including cross-browser issues), JavaScript (including jQuery)
- Git (or some other SCM system)
- Server setup and basic server administration would be a bonus
- PHP and CakePHP knowledge would also be a bonus. But if you know
Rails, that won't be a problem.

If you're interested, please email jobs at cloudmint.com

Thank you,
Palaniappan,

You might also want to consider using a lightweight VM, in which case,
irrespective of the base OS, you can have dev environments on every
developer box.

Try

http://www.fogproject.org with APt-cacher and I think this will be suitable
for you as FOG can be integrated with AD also.

FOG project can be implemented in Virtualized environment also.

Create a machine or couple of machines with different sets (one with
Ubuntu+Eclipse etc.,  and another with Ubuntu+RoR etc.,with all the updates
possible) and these master images can be cloned on to desktops using PXE.
It will take maximum 7-8 minutes for the total desktop to be ready.

Hope this is what you are looking for and let us know your progress and
also what solution you have deployed.

Regards

Ravi Kumar Tenneti

Subject: [Ilugc] OAOD (Cain)
Message-ID: <CALJ7LH_JWT_pEYv-9_66uzdTYJ6adF-oi0C_+tNqfjTEsQXkyQ@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Cain

What is it:

Cain performs stochastic and deterministic simulations of chemical
reactions. It can spawn multiple simulation processes to utilize
multi-core computers. It stores models, methods, and simulation output
(populations and reaction counts) in an XML format. In addition, SBML
models can be imported and exported. The models and methods can be
read from input files or edited within the program.

The GUI (Graphical User Interface) is written in Python and uses the
wxPython toolkit. Most of the solvers are implemented as command line
executables, written in C++, which are driven by Cain. This makes it
easy to launch batch jobs. It also simplifies the process of adding
new solvers. Cain offers a variety of solvers:

    Gillespie's direct method.
    Gillespie's first reaction method.
    Gibson and Bruck's next reaction method.
    Tau-leaping.
    Hybrid direct/tau-leaping.
    ODE integration. This package provides the architecture
independent files for cain

To know more about it:

http://cain.sourceforge.net/

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install cain

Hi Friends,


As part of doing a substantial project w.r.t. Computer Science Engineering
domain, I'm thinking of doing a project regrading "Network Installing of
Windows OS using Linux"!


I have been trying regarding this project for around 2 months but couldn't
break the ice yet. Hence, I request you guys to come up with any sort of
idea that would in the development of this project!

Ideas, suggestions and corrections are all welcome. Mail those to
linuxramesh007 at gmail.com

I would be extremely grateful to all kind hearts who would come forward to
help me in this regard.



Thanks!

Message-ID: <CALV9ombj6eTFBbY4QSNxEVvrP7T1-tV4c7oNuPMFtD9HSe+dPg@mail.gmail.com>

Tool of the Day: SWAT

Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for
Unix systems, providing support for cross-platform file and
printer sharing with Microsoft Windows, OS X, and other Unix
systems.
This package allows us to administer a Samba server via a web browser.
SWAT is no longer actively maintained, and its default configuration is not
secure for use over an untrusted network.SWAT will also rewrite smb.conf,
rearranging the entries and deleting all comments as well as include= and
copy= options, so is not suitable for use in conjunction with hand-edited
smb.conf files or the default package-managed configuration.

version: 2:3.6.3-2 ubuntu2
size: 2.1 mb

Hi,


I have done it. you configure a linux server with pxe boot/tftp and then
keep your Windows Image on tftp server.
this way you can install your Win OS.

Do a performance test using jmeter.

http://www.skill-guru.com/blog/2010/05/25/apace-jmeter-load-testing/
http://blogs.atlassian.com/2008/10/performance_testing_with_jmete/

Then, you have to reconfigure apache with proper values.

      I haven't used jmeter, and so I can't comment on what all it
does. But for apache, the tool that is normally used is 'ab' - The
apache benchmark[1]. But just to answer your question, apache, with
proper configurations, will be able to handle 15k. Thanks

My experience has been very bad.
Moodle is extremely heavy on resources.
Failed miserably for a friend of mine with just 300 concurrent users
running on a shared VPS instance, I forgot about the configuration, but it
had 2GB RAM for sure.

>From http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/Installing_Moodle
*The general rule of thumb is that Moodle can support 10 to 20 concurrent
users for every 1GB of RAM, but this will vary depending on your specific
hardware and software combination and the type of use. 'Concurrent' really
means web server processes in memory at the same time (i.e. users
interacting with the system within a window of a few seconds). It does NOT
mean people 'logged in'.*

Adding to the above, from their own estimates, you would require 15,000/20
= 750GB of RAM!
Would suggest you go for a load balanced system with multiple Moodle/Apache
instances with a MySQL cluster.

Moodle Quizes are not static content deliveries and they require PHP and
MySQL CPU usage. So do be careful for such a large project.

If it is just a quiz, you might not want to consider Moodle.

     Oh, I forgot the moodle part when I replied initially. I am
sorry. When I said apache can handle 15k connections, I was talking
just about apache, not in combination with moodle. Thanks

For such high loads, you might want to consider clustering, load
balancing etc. at the different components in the software as well as
the hardware (network) stacks.

Consider nginx it has been designed for load balancing and reverse proxy.

For Moodle resources, it would be best to query the moodle guys in
their forum.   I am sure someone somewhere on the planet has tried
such a load.
