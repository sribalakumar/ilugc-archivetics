Wow. That is one old box you have. You might want to try to install
Redhat Linux on that box.

Greetings!

This is in regard to one of the new GNU/Linux
Vidyashram initiatives - Careers with GNU/Linux. 

I have put up a small list that is very brief at:

http://www.shakthimaan.com -> Careers

If you are working/developing GNU/Linux at your work
place, please do send me an e-mail (not to ilugc
mailing list) with the following info:

Company/Institution name:
Logo:
Website:
Location(s):
Domain(s):
Opportunities:
Skills:
Hiring (if any):

I shall add the same to the list. We also need to
elaborate on the existing companies (and
institutions). As more information flows in, we can
expand the database.

Looking forward to hearing from you all,

Regards,

SK

Message-ID: <766FD1B393382B41BA553AE9FED30D60088D4F@chnmsg03.gavsin.com>

Hi,

Me running 8.12.8 on RH 9.0. For local delivery of mails withing
the box, the mails are dispatched only when the 'To:' is of the
form <username>@localhost.localdomain. I would like the mails to
be locally dispatched when the 'To:' is:

	<username>
	OR
	<username>@<(local)hostname>
	OR
	<username>@localhost
	OR
	<username>@localhost.localdomain

I have entered all my machine aliases in the file /etc/mail/local-
host-names. Still the problem. Any hints ?

Also - why does it take so much time (2-3 mins) for sendmail to 
startup from /etc/init.d/sendmail ? Can this be tuned ?

For programming jobs, please also ask them whether the programmer gets
to write free software. This is more important than just working on
GNU/Linux.

One should work on free software projects during free
time to gain knowledge/expertise, which will in turn
help in in-house/billing projects that use GNU/Linux.

Message-ID: <20050502095023.18955.qmail@webmail50.rediffmail.com>

In one of our server the KBD stopped working suddenly. Also, I was able to ping the server but I was unable to connect it through SSH. 
(We have RHEL 3 in that server. We are running squid, named, in that box)

As I left with no options we did a improper shutdown and after restart there was no problem in the box.

I don't have clues about why KBD stopped detecting and why SSH didn't work suddenly. I checked messages, boot.log.

Can some one give inputs on what might have went wrong?

Hi Viji,

There may be several factors responsible for this problem. Linux is
typically a very stable operating systems and I have personally
experienced uptimes of nearly a year. Others report fews years at a
stretch. Usually these problems tend to be power/hardware related. A
blackout or a brownout can cause the machine to hang without leaving a
trace in the logs that might help. The problem may also be RAM
related. If the problem persists, please run memtest86 and make sure
your RAM is ok. Check your power connections for loose contacts. But
it can as well be an isoloted, rare, random event. You need to wait
and see if it shows up again.

One Day One Command 
===================

route -- Show / Manipulate the IP routing table.

Summary:

Route manipulates the kernel's IP routing tables. Its primary use is
to set up static routes to specific hosts or networks via a network
interface (like eth0 ...).

Example:

$ route -- Show routing table. It will try resolve the name for IP.

$ route -n -- Same as above. But won't resolve.

$ route -ee -- Show more detailed info.

$ route -A inet6 -- Show IPv6 related route info.

# route add -net 127.0.0.0 -- Adds the normal loopback entry.

# route add -net 192.168.14.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0 -- Adds 
                     a route to the network 192.168.14.x via "eth0".

# route add default gw midas-gw dev eth1 -- Set the default Gateway 
                                            for eth1.

# route del default dev eth0 -- Remove the default Gateway of eth0.

# route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 reject -- Sets rejecting  
                                       route  for  the "10.x.x.x."

# route add -net 192.168.13.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw wify1 -- Adds 
               the net "192.168.13.x" to be gatewayed through wify1.

What type of server is it? Do you have adequate air-conditioning where
the server sits? I find that this syndrome happens when certain
classes of servers overheat.

 From my understanding $i stands for entries in the /root/allowed-sites and
-dport stands for destination port.
-sport stands for source port.

Iam using xine on my PCQ linux 2005 (FC3), It hangs
when ever I open any media file (avi,mpeg, etc.,). I
can't even able to shutdown the PC unless resetting.

I even installed Kaffeine 6.0 and Mplayer, thses also
react as same as xine.

If simply I open and close the xine or kaffeine the
system hangs up. 

Is there any lib to be install or what would be the
reason for this prob.

Please help.

FYI raid-1 is mirroring that is what ever the data stored in first
partition (hdc1) will automatically replicated in second partition
(hdc5). It provides some sort of fault tolerance.

Having two partitions on the same disk doing RAID-1 is quite
pointless, in my opinion. If the disk starts to fail, you might be
able to recover your data, but since the mirror is maintained on the
same disk, chances are high that you will lose data anyway. RAID-1 is
best if you have two disks of identical size, and you can setup
mirroring between them. By using two partitions on the same disk to do
RAID-1, you lose half the size of the disk - you will get only 40GB
storage from an 80GB disk. Also, disk writes become much slower (since
each chunk of data has to be written in two places on the same disk).

The cons outweigh the pros, so to speak. Get another disk of the same
size and then setup RAID-1 between them.

on the same physical hard disk?  you are wasting your time configuring
it.  if this was across two separate disks, then fine.

The command '/sbin/lilo -M /dev/hda' should install
MBR on /dev/hda. Try 'man lilo' for more information.

Message-ID: <ed2d3c0005050419197e75c0de@mail.gmail.com>

Dear members,
Warm greetings, I have an issue right in front of me. 

One of my client is having a browsing center.
He was running M$windows 2000 Adv server.
Every thing went all well till March 19 2005.
 Suddenly the entire browsing center got paralaysed because of
connectivity due to virus problem.
when i checked with netstat -n it showed too many ports (about say
nearly 60 to 70) ip ports opened. The client had a tough fight with
the ISP(Airtel).

My client is too fixed with m$windows and my suggestions of turning
all the nodes to linux turned down by the client fearing the
adaptablity of their customers.

Finally i gave a filtering solutions
by keeping a linux proxy server , supported by squid proxy in fedora core 3

I am lucky enough in configuring squid.conf and squid is ready to
serve. When i disabled iptables -F firewall the nodes able to browse.
but keeping so , i feel of security issue i want to configure ip
tables for the nodes.

I seek pointers what to do from here on.

I have one ethernet card in my machine eth0
and the other computers in browsing station are windows 98.

Kindly give me some notes  what should i do with respect to iptables
to enable the traffic flowing to all the windows 98 system (about 6 of
them in number) from my linux squid proxy machine.
 
Thanks in advance.

I've got a couple of questions

1) Is there any program\tool-chain that can be used to create Macromedia
Flash files on Linux? Or if anyone can tell me what the magic words to
enter in google are. "Flash" is such a common word, I don't get any
useful results.

2) What do you use to view pdfs?
I've got kpdf,gpdf,xpdf and evince.
evince is really nice (the only one to support incremental search and
displaying an index) but its somewhat buggy and refuses to render a few
of my pdfs.


Thanks,

Subject: [Ilugc] Xen-concept doubt
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0505050233420.9002@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,

I understood from the web that xen is
para virtualization and it is similar to
IBM OS360/370 mainframe architecture and
performance.

I also understood that Xen concept is beter
than bochs or WINE or QEMU or VMWare which
uses pure virtualization and therefore these
have performance hit when compared to Xen.

I read that the operating system to be put
as guest OS has to be modified in code.

My understanding is,

To install multiple OSes, first I need
to install Linux1(any distro). Over that I
need to install Xen.
After that I will able to install
Linux2(any distro) NetBSD and OPenBSD.

The doubt I have is
1.Does the kernel code of the guest OSes(Linux2,
NetBSD and OPenBSD in the example above) has
to be modified.
2.Does the host OS(Linux1 in the example
above has to be modified).

3.If I need to run different versions of Windows
or Linux (say version1, version2, version3),
do these versions' source codes need to be
changed. If that is the case, why would any user
take the pain of changing the code and run
different versions of the OS.

I am aware that, as of now Windows is
supported only with academic license.

Please correct or clarify me if any of my
understanding is wrong.

Thanks and Regards,
Carti

Yes. Some CPU Instructions pertaining to memory will be disabled.
mem.c (?) in the kernel sources will be modified for this.

> 2.Does the host OS(Linux1 in the example

Some shared lib's pertaining to memory have to disabled.
Read the Xen-FAQ and README.

I presume you mean the Kernel when you say "Linux".
If so, then yes, the kernel will be different for the parent host and the vhosts.

Why do we need to do it?
Kernel Debugging, Security, dedicated web hosting etc.

Xensource, a company founded by the Xen dev's is providing vhost based products.
( I'm not sure about the details)

Message-ID: <ed2d3c0005050505344d32dc00@mail.gmail.com>

Dear members,
Warm greetings, I have an issue right in front of me.

One of my client is having a browsing center.
He was running M$windows 2000 Adv server.
Every thing went all well till March 19 2005.
Suddenly the entire browsing center got paralaysed because of
connectivity due to virus problem.
when i checked with netstat -n it showed too many ports (about say
nearly 60 to 70) ip ports opened. The client had a tough fight with
the ISP(Airtel).

My client is too fixed with m$windows and my suggestions of turning
all the nodes to linux turned down by the client fearing the
adaptablity of their customers.

Finally i gave a filtering solutions
by keeping a linux proxy server , supported by squid proxy in fedora core 3

I am lucky enough in configuring squid.conf and squid is ready to
serve. When i disabled iptables -F firewall the nodes able to browse.
but keeping so , i feel of security issue i want to configure ip
tables for the nodes.

I seek pointers what to do from here on.

I have one ethernet card in my machine eth0
and the other computers in browsing station are windows 98.

Kindly give me some notes  what should i do with respect to iptables
to enable the traffic flowing to all the windows 98 system (about 6 of
them in number) from my linux squid proxy machine.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Kannan,

-s and -d Specifies  Source and Destination IP Addresses
Source (`-s', `--source' or `--src') and destination (`-d',
`--destination' or `--dst')

we can specify source or destination  in 4 ways
1.Full name ->`localhost' or `www.linuxhq.com'
2.Direct Ip-> `127.0.0.1'or 192.168.0.1
3, 4.   allow specification of a group of IP
 addresses, such as `199.95.207.0/24' or `199.95.207.0/255.255.255.0'.

--sport or -source--port specift the tcp port or  a range of port

Your server conatin the scripts which run iptable rule
 iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.x.x/24 -d $i -p tcp -dport 80 -j ACCEPT

The rule specify that any tcp packet coming from any source
192.168.0.0/24 can  forward to  destination with port 80(system given
in /root/allowed-sites  )

Dear Luggies,

    On behalf of ILUGC,I,Bhaskar and Srinivasan conducted a workshop
on OpenSource software at the Ramakrishan Mission Institute-College,
a polytechnic teaching mechanical engg. It was held for 3 days from
3-May-05 to 5-May-05

    We covered basics like installation,desktops, gui tools like
OO,GIMP, programming like glade, quanta plus etc. More than 80% of
time was practicals to the participants.

    There were about 14 participants - Polytechnic mechanical engg
faculty, Computer science faculty from Vivekananda College,
Sys.admins from RK Math, Teachers from RKM schools, and a swamiji
from the Math.

     The participants were very enthusiastic and I am sure FOSS will
be a part of the RK Mission.

      I will also be co-ordinating in developing software for
computerising their administrative, student and donation management
system.

      Whoever is willing to contribute to the software development
please contact me offlist.

Dear all,

Ma Foi is looking for developers with good open source toolset knowledge
and development experience.

Other than a strong preference for debian - we are not biased about 
platforms/languages. Ideally you should know one or more of 
Python/PHP/Perl/java and be willing to learn the others.

Development experience between 2 - 5 years is expected - web-based 
application development would be preferred.

Experience in ASP+(SQL-Server|Oracle) is useful - we need to enhance and 
migrate a lot of applications from those platforms.

We like our people to be well-rounded: you will be expected to roll-up your
 sleeves, install linux, configure apache/twisted/moodle or whatever we are
tinkering with currrently.

Location: Chennai

Please send your CVs to vamseekrishna@mafoi.com. If you match our 
requirement, we'll get in touch with you.

Categories? What are you referring to by categories?

I don't see why you can't ask C questions here. Start
with Schaum's series for C programming. Check this

C doesn't have categories of functions, or you haven't expressed
yourself very clearly.

Subject: [Ilugc] NRCFOSS need your suggestion to design Electives for CS in
	FOSS
Message-ID: <e2f046c050506015029f03ec1@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

The National Resource Centre for Free/Open Source Software (NRC-FOSS)
which has been established at MIT campus of Anna University, is going
to conduct training for 100 teachers, from 50 different engineering
colleges in Tamilnadu (2 per college) to provide two elective courses
for Computer Science students in the area of FOSS.  The training will
help the teachers to handle the elective courses in their respective
colleges.  The first batch of 100 teachers, training is planned some
time in June 2005.

I would like to hear from the LUG members what are the things that you
want to include in the elective courses (to CS students in the 3rd
year).  Remember we have only 45 hours per elective.  Thus we can't
include each and every possible topics in FOSS.

I will collect all your suggestions and pass it to the respective
authorities at NRCFOSS.  It is time for us to react and provide
constructive feedback to design a proper elective course for CS/IT
students to spread FOSS in India.

Let us brain storm the topics first and then come up with a time slot
for each topic to fit in 45 hours for each elective.

Note: I am not an employee of NRCFOSS and simply doing it voluntarily
inorder to provide them the feedback as a member of FOSS community to
device some good syllabus for the FOSS electives.

You can force the users to log in to edit. Since ILUGC is using 
MediaWiki, putting this in /var/www/wiki/LocalSettings.php will do that:

One Day One Command
===================

vlock -- Virtual Console lock program

Summary:

vlock is a program to lock one or more sessions on the text console.  
This is especially useful for Linux machines which have multiple users
with access to the console.  One user may lock his/her session(s)  
while still allowing other users to use the system on other consoles.
If desired, the entire console may be locked and console switching
disabled.

To unlock, Password of the user, who locked it, Or root is needed.

Example:

$ vlock -- Lock the current session.

$ vlock -c -- Same as above.

$ vlock -a -- Lock all console sessions and disable the console 
              switching.

Read: man vlock

General C question

Anto,

If I am right you are looking for the functions in C language

The best book for functions in C is Yeshwant Kanetkar's Let Us C, 
Exploring C

Its even simpler to understand than Dennis Ritchie's one

 2. send instant message to anyone - fine its working...
 
 3. now, change ur system date to 19-Jan-2038, 03:14:07 AM or above

 4. Confirm weather ur date is changed
 
 5. again send instant message to anyone...
 
 Your YM crahes....
 
 * * * YES ALL NETWORK BASED APPLICATION WILL NOT WORK NOW * * *
 
 Why.....
 
 What is it?
 
 Starting at GMT 03:14:07, Tuesday, January 19, 2038, It is expected to
 see lots of systems around the world breaking magnificently:
 satellites falling out of orbit, massive power outages (like the 2003
 North American blackout), hospital life support system failures, phone
 system interruptions, banking errors, etc. One second after this
 critical second, many of
 
 these systems will have wildly inaccurate date settings, producing all
 kinds of unpredictable consequences. In short, many of the dire
 predictions for the year 2000 are much more likely to actually occur
 in the year 2038! Consider the year 2000 just a dry run. In case you
 think we can sit on this issue for another 30 years before addressing
 it, consider that reports of temporal echoes of the 2038 problem are
 already starting to appear in future date calculations for mortgages
 and vital statistics!
 
 In the first month of the year 2038 C.E. many computers will encounter
 a date-related bug in their operating systems and/or in the
 applications they run. This can result in incorrect and wildly
 inaccurate dates being reported by the operating system and/or
 applications. The effect of this bug is hard to predict, because many
 applications are not prepared for the resulting "skip" in reported
 time - anywhere from 1901 to a "broken record" repeat of the reported
 
 time at the second the bug occurs. Also, may make some small
 adjustment to the actual time the bug expresses itself. This bug to
 cause serious problems on many platforms, especially Unix and
 Unix-like platforms, because these systems will "run out of time".
 
 What causes it?
 
 Time_t is a data type used by C and C++ programs to represent dates
 and times internally. (Windows programmers out there might also
 recognize it as the basis for the CTime and CTimeSpan classes in MFC.)
 time_t is actually just an integer, a whole number, that counts the
 number of seconds since January 1, 1970 at 12:00 AM Greenwich Mean
 Time. A time_t value of 0 would be 12:00:00 AM (exactly midnight)
 1-Jan-1970, a time_t value of 1 would be 12:00:01 AM
 
 (one second after midnight) 1-Jan-1970, etc.. 
 
 some example times and their exact time_t representations:
 
 Date & time time_t representation
 
 1-Jan-1970, 12:00:00 AM GMT 0
 
 1-Jan-1970, 12:01:00 AM GMT 60
 
 1-Jan-1970, 01:00:00 AM GMT 3 600
 
 2-Jan-1970, 12:00:00 AM GMT 86 400
 
 1-Jan-1971, 12:00:00 AM GMT 31 536 000
 
 1-Jan-1972, 12:00:00 AM GMT 63 072 000
 
 1-Jan-2038, 12:00:00 AM GMT 2 145 916 800
 
 19-Jan-2038, 03:14:07 AM GMT 2 147 483 647
 
 By the year 2038, the time_t representation for the current time will
 be over 2 140 000 000. And that's the problem. A modern 32-bit
 computer stores a "signed integer" data type, such as time_t, in 32
 bits. The first of these bits is used for the positive/negative sign
 of the integer, while the remaining 31 bits are used to store the
 number itself. The highest number these 31 data bits can store works
 out to exactly 2 147 483 647. A time_t value of this exact number, 2
 147 483 647, represents January 19, 2038, at 7 seconds past 3:14 AM
 Greenwich Mean Time. So, at 3:14:07 AM GMT on that fateful day, every
 time_t used in a 32-bit C or C++ program will reach its upper limit.
 
 One second later, on 19-January-2038 at 3:14:08 AM GMT, disaster strikes. 
 
 When a signed integer reaches its maximum value and then gets
 incremented, it wraps around to its lowest possible negative value.
 This means a 32-bit signed integer, such as a time_t, set to its
 maximum value of 2 147 483 647 and then incremented by 1, will become
 -2 147 483 648. Note that "-" sign at the beginning of this large
 number. A time_t value of -2 147 483 648 would represent December 13,
 1901 at 8:45:52 PM GMT.
 
 So, if all goes normally, 19-January-2038 will suddenly become
 13-December-1901 in every time_t across the globe, and every date
 calculation based on this figure will go haywire. And it gets worse.
 Most of the support functions that use the time_t data type cannot
 handle negative time_t values at all. They simply fail and return an
 error code.
 
 A quick check with the following Perl script may help determine if
 your computers will have problems (this requires Perl to be installed
 on your system, of course):
 
 #!/usr/bin/perl
 
 # Use POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) use POSIX;
 
 # Set the Time Zone to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) for 
 
 date calculations.
 
 $ENV{'TZ'} = "GMT";
 
 # Count up in seconds of Epoch time just before and
 
 after the critical event.
 
 for ($clock = 2147483641; $clock < 2147483651;
 
 $clock++)
 
 {
 
 print ctime($clock);
 
 }
 
 For example, the output of this script on Debian GNU/Linux (kernel
 2.4.22) (An affected system) will be
 
 # ./2038.pl

 Fri Dec 13 20:45:52 1901
 
 Fri Dec 13 20:45:52 1901
 
 Solution
 
 "The best way to predict the future is to engineer it." Consider
 testing your mission-critical code well ahead of time on a
 non-production test platform set just before the critical date. For
 more general applications, just using large types for storing dates
 will do the trick in most cases. For example, in GNU C, 64-bits (a
 "long " type) is sufficient to keep the
 
 time from rolling over for literally geological eons This just means
 any executables the operating systems runs will always get the correct
 time reported to them when queried in the correct manner. It doesn't
 stop the executables you may still want to be worried about
 Well-written programs can simply be recompiled with a new version of
 the library that uses, for example, 8-byte values for the storage
 format. This is possible because the library encapsulates the whole
 time activity with its own time types and functions (unlike most
 mainframe programs, which did not standardize their date formats or
 calculations). So the Year 2038 problem should not be nearly as hard
 to fix as the Y2K problem was.
 
 Admittedly, some don't feel that this impending disaster will strike
 too many people. They reason that, by the time 2038 rolls around, most
 programs will be running on 64-bit or even 128-bit computers. In a
 64-bit program, a time_t could represent any date and time in the
 future out to 292 000 000 000 A.D., which is about 20 times the
 currently estimated age of the universe. The problem with this kind of
 optimism is the same root problem behind most of the Year 2000
 
 concerns that plagued the software industry in previous years: Legacy
 Code. Even if every PC in the year 2038 has a 64-bit CPU, there will
 be a lot of older 32-bit programs running on them.
 
 The greatest danger with the Year 2038 Problem is its invisibility.
 The more-famous Year 2000 is a big, round number; it only takes a few
 seconds of thought, even for a computer-illiterate person, to imagine
 what might happen when 1999 turns into 2000. But January 19, 2038 is
 not nearly as obvious. Software companies will probably not think of
 trying out a Year 2038 scenario before doomsday strikes. Of course,
 there will be some warning ahead of time. Scheduling software, billing
 programs, personal reminder calendars, and other such pieces of code
 that set dates in the near future will fail as soon as one of their
 target dates exceeds 19-Jan-2038, assuming a time_t is used to store
 them.
 
 Good luck, and hope no ones flying car breaks down in 2038

This is all bunkum.  None of this is going to happen.  Because none of
these things will EXIST in 2038.  Peak Oil is here.  As I see it, modern 
industrial civilisation will have come to an abrupt and catastrophic end
long before 2038 :-) !  No worries about flying cars breaking down
because we'll all be too busy sharpening our little stone spears!

There are lot of newcomers and I see a lot of
top-posting in the mailing list. We need to post a
mailing list FAQ every month to keep reminding people
not to top-post.

Each list evolves its own ettiquette. Personally, am more comfortable
with 'top-posting'. But if the majority here feel top-posting is
bugging, I'll change my style for this list. So, will the majority
raise their voice and say 'aye' or 'nay' for toppsoting!

thanks,
mano

Lets see, you want to figure out whether list etiquette conforms to
your personal preferences on top-posting. After having received mail
saying "don't top-post" you want majority to let you know wether they
share your preference. Hmm... here's a simple way :
1) Point your web browser at http://www.google.com
2) In the search box type : "top-posting" OR "top-post" ilugc
3) Read results.

On a personal note, I'm not aware to lists that look too kindly at top
posting, but I'm not subscribed to man, and I could be wrong...

cheers

  Top-posting is considered rude, fairly universally - whether
you're replying to an e-mail, a USENET post, a mailing
list, or on an online forum/group. It suggests that you haven't
bothered to read the message you're replying to.

  Two categories of users top-post heavily - clueless newbies,
and Pointy-Haired Bosses (aka PHBs). Both are considered
undesirables on most lists.

  If you want to avoid being ignored or flamed, don't top-post.
Period.

... on mailing lists at any rate

If you try to do interleaved quoting like this in what is basically a
top posted thread, you break readablity quite easily

At least when replying to work email, it is quite easy to just glance at
the first line or two in the email, see the reply and move on to the
next mail.  Top posting does have its uses there.

So it all depends on the context.

Just to re-iterate SRS' point about value of top posting in corporate
environements...

At work, people top post heavily, and not just PHBs.  Selective
quoting (and deleting 'unnecssary stuff') works in a forum like ilugc,
where the entire interested popluace is expected to be following the
discussions on list, and the list is archived anyway.'

Where these assumptions are not valid, top-posting is very handy.  To
take an example, let's say a team are discussing a bug in their code,
and after a few mails they realise that it is really a problem in
another subsystem, then it is extremly convenient to just forward a
single email to the relevant team, and have that single email have all
the necessary context and prior debugging that has happened for the
problem.

So, yeah, top-posting is extremely handy in many situations.  But
ilugc does *not* present any of them.  So do not top post in ilugc :-)

Hi all,
 
Is it advisable to connect the cable from the cable operator to the computer's TVTuner card? What made me ask this question is a thread in our ILUGC which discussed about ISPs, stressed not to opt for cable ISPs, since they electrocute the PCs. Some body pls suggest.
 
Thx in advance.

In latest mandrakes-mandriva, there are  kernel rpms for 586, 686
separately,(after installing the default kernel initially, after
installation update to the i686 kernel. There is a noticable increase

  (Please use Carriage Returns in your text - if you rely on line
wrap, it messes up formatting for lots of people.)

  If you isolate the external cable electrically from the cable
you plug into the tuner card, you will obtain a measure of safety.
The easiest way to do this is to use a two-section back-to-back Balun
to convert the 75-ohm unbalanced impedance of the coax to a 300-ohm
balanced impedance suitable for a ribbon cable, and back again to
75-ohm unbalanced, suitable for coax, which can be plugged into the
TV tuner card.

Cable -> Balun-> 300-ohm Ribbon Cable -> Balun-> 75-ohm Coax -> Tuner Card

The Baluns and 300-ohm rubbon cable should be readily available at
any TV parts shop. The Baluns provide the isolation, and will save you
from garden-variety shorts with 230v and 440v mains, but it still
won't save you from a lightning strike or a short with a 11-KV HT line,
both of which have been known to happen in Madras.

Incidentally, I'm not sure if a stock DOCSIS cable modem will still work
after this isolation section is inserted, so if anybody has done this,
please post to the list to clarify (Downlink will probably work, I'm
not sure about the uplink).

Free Software, Free Society
28th -30th May, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.

The Free Software, Free Society (FSFS) Conference, organized by Government and 
civil society organizations from Brazil, Italy, Venezuela and India, is 
scheduled for 28-30 May 2005 in the Southern Indian city of Thiruvananthapuram 
(Trivandrum), the capital of the province of Kerala. The Conference is 
primarily an attempt to initiate a South-South-North dialogue on the use of 
Free Software as a useful paradigm for non-software realms and its role as an 
instrument for development. In the process, the countries involved will share 
their perspective and experiences in using Free Software.

Vision

Over two-and-a-half decades, Free Software has inspired an alternative approach 
to creation, use and redistribution of software. The values of Free Software 
has been the inspiration for other kind of intellectual content as well, as 
illustrated, for example, by the Creative Commons initiative. Located at the 
intersection of Free Software, Development and  Society, the FSFS Conference 
will examine the application of the Free Software
model for the purpose of evolving more equitable development and information 
sharing models for humanity.

In particular, the Conference will discuss the use of Free Software for 
addressing issues of technology access and the digital divide and also develop 
further the alternative paradigms for sharing intellectual content.

Participation and Registration

Apart from the Brazilian delegation (4 delegates), Venezuela (20 delegates) and 
the Italian delegation (3 delegates) about 40-50 delegates from various parts 
of India are also expected to attend the programme. In addition, delegates from 
South Asia (Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh) and from UN organizations 
are expected to attend the programme.

A delegate fee of Rs. 1000 (for Indian citizens) or US$ 50 (for non-Indian 
delegates) is payable by delegates in order to cover the costs of the 
Conference. Delegate fee includes Conference kit, food during the conference, 
participation in sessions and cultural programmes. Delegate fee does not 
include travel or local accommodation. However, accommodation can be arranged 
by us on request on direct payment basis. A wide range of hotel rooms are 
available from budget (INR 500 / US$ 25) to luxury (INR 4500 / US$ 150). For 
students delegate fee will be Rs. 500. Click here for Online registration form.

1. Post the output of:

ls -l /dev/dsp

2. Check if your sound is not muted. This happens most
of the time.

It is fairly clear that top-posting has its
uses in particularly in an environment where
there is quick 'tap-back a one-liner' type of
exchange. I often end up with such exchanges in my
current organization - a hr consulting company;
had a lot in the previous company too - sw dev.

Often in these cases you are engaging in a short-term,
many - 5 -20 msgs - quick exchange. That is the mails
are part of a series that are expected by the recipient
and need to quickly fall into a pattern - the typical
participants in such exchanges have 4/5 such 'conversations'
going.

Literally this is an InstantMessnger type interaction,
with a very liberal definition of 'instant'. And in this
environment top-posting is probably preferable.

Of course none of these is applicable to the type of
discussions that take place on mailing lists.

In sum: top-post within yr company; not merely to
toe the PHB line. Stay off top-posting in mlists

PS: Nice to a vintage BGa post - with a new  nice sheen
to that characteristic incisive style.

Knowingly or unknowingly, you have the beginnings of what is known as
a segmented network design.

Hmm... if you run a WINS server, I think windows networking works over subnets.

> *The 10 members r having their emailid in mailserver we dont know how to

It ought to work by default. All you need to do is to run the command:

ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.254

and make sure that (a) your windows machine has packet forwarding
enabled, and (b) your 192.168.2.0/24 subnet has default gateway set to
192.168.2.254.

If you are not particular about your gnome applications settings, you can just delete the .gconfd directory.If the problem still persists, then delete the .gnome* folders.
All the gnome settings will now be reset to default.

Same as /tmp dir. But setting up permission for each file is users
responsibility or use same umask.

Hi,

I want to know what are the possible reasons of router connection failure 
other than the correct entry of router address ? 

Is traffic on a particular server a reason for nopt connecting to host.

Are there any other reasons for NOT GETTIN CONNECTED TO SERVER ?

Bharathi S, Can you please help?

Anyone please, Its getting harder and harder to find a solution?

OK. I get it that top posting is frowned upon in this list :-) 

I thought I'll go one step further and stop quoting earlier messages
at all as those interested can browse msg by msg (Gmail makes it so
much easier). For others, as Sriram Karra points out "the list is
archived anyway".

Perhaps we should make this a part of this lists ettiquette!!

Not only on this list, but on every mailing-list which takes part in active discussion.

No, that just makes it even worse.
Not everyone has GMail and not everyone can refer to old mails just to follow a discussion.
Imagine a thread with more than 100 posts.Do you want a person to refer to 100 mails just to find out who has posted what, on a particular topic.

As for archival, the above mentioned point holds good.
Do you want to do a google search just to find out what the other person has said in an earlier mail.
 
> Perhaps we should make this a part of this lists ettiquette!!

There is no specific "ilugc list-ettiquette", we just follow rules that have been laid down to make e-mail easier to read.

We will be having our regular LUG meeting this
Saturday, May 14, 2005. 

Can we have it at Ma Foi Academy (than IIT-M)?

We shall start our GLV meeting on May 21, 2005 at Ma
Foi Academy. If anyone is interested in giving a talk,
well and good. But, I want this 21st to be a meeting
where we plan for workshops/seminars/talks and discuss
topics for the upcoming semester. We can need to
discuss on projects for final year students, and
career options/"networking" - the two new initiatives.

Last semester was fabulous. We have even more
volunteers this time, and hence we can double our
efforts this semester.

We will be having a talk by AB in the first week of
June.

More interesting news to follow :) ... will keep you
posted.

Message-ID: <1115688919.4107.2.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I went to this url:
http://www.nivi.com/blog/article/greasemonkey-and-business-models

today, and soon after I started viewing the page, I started getting an
audio narration of what was written in the article. I looked at the html
source, but couldn't find anything that looked like a link to an audio
file.
I also couldn't seem to find any firefox preference to turn this off.

Is this happening to anyone else?
How is it happening and how do I turn it off?
I'm running FireFox 1.01 on Fedora Core 3.

Thanks,
Haran

Hah., what of people who read mail offline., who are not gifted
with a 24/7 connection, who are still stuck up on a dialup
line.. (like me).

Stop reasoning out., `top-posting` is out of the question. And,
quoting is necessary. `No quoting` is just as bad as `over
quoting`. Read ESRs smartquestions. (google for it)

are you able to reach it over the network, via a ping.

Is your telnet `time-outing`? then you should check for timeout
values in your `telnet` program, and increase it so that your
telnet program waits for the router to respond.

There can be a number of reasons.

Cool.., We know that, in some corporates the accessing the external
mail services are blocked. In this situation, if member nicely format
his mail then this kind of problem will not arise. :)

So Every one should check his Mailer setting. Otherwise, you will be
bombarded by this kind of mails.

Well, if you think for a moment from the company's perspective
(however misguided it is):

If a company blocks email sites, the employment agreement would also
have clauses like "you will not use company-provided email for
purposes that are not related to the business of Foobar Pvt. Ltd." -
and by posting on ilugc from their company emails, people are
violating that, thereby jeopardizing their own employment and career.
This is something that should not be encouraged.

Kicking them off with an advice to subscribe from an alternative
address ought to be just fine. That is what linux-india-* lists do.

anybody else is getting this problem. I try to search for something in 
firefox, and the second time, firefox just blanks out. Where ever the

        I have no choice but to restart, each time I search for a term. 
It's painful. It happens even if I get the latest version of firefox. 
I'm beginning to think it's a GTK problem (I'm on Gnome). Any ideas?

Did you check with a new profile.
Many-a-times a new profile helps me out of some screwedup extension.

start firefox wit profile manager as "firefox -profilemanager" 
create a new profile and try with the new profile. Good luck.

I'm using Firefox 1.0.3. This problem was present even before I upgraded 
from 1.0.2. I tried googling around, but I can't find any references to 
this problem. All my other GTK apps function without any problem.

Hi friends,

       We had some controversial conversations in the recent past
here. I was also involved in some of those like top-posting issue,
company's confidential disclaimer etc. I know we have some rules or
netiquettes in here. We cannot expect a new comer to know all these
stuff. If some one violating this should be warned, but how is the
question now. Most of us immediately replied to them, on the list to
STOP THAT (hope you can understand why this is all caps). This will
make a new comer nervous and leads to an unnecessary controversy.

	OK here is my suggestion if some one makes any mistake or violation
please inform them off the list by sending them a private mail. If
they keep doing this again warn them on the list and if still they
haven't corrected their mistakes we can kick them off the list.
Chennai LUG is a public forum it's available to everyone who wants to
learn Linux and GNU stuff we can expect very dumb new comer here so
it's our duty to make them feel comfortable in here. After all there
is nothing wrong in being kind to others.

I'm sorry if I missed out something else, but this doesn't look to me
as what students should be taught in 6th semester of CS.

This is what students should be learning in their third year (5th/6th
semesters):

The course will be offered as an _elective course_ in the 6th. semester.
There will also be an associated laboratory course covering the same
material.  This is _in addition_ to the `standard' CS curriculum in the
6th semester like the one in the link above.

Later,

Anand.

Reading MKS' mail (asking for suggestions for this syllabus), I thought 
that this elective course would be more oriented towards the philosophy 
behind FOSS (motivation) and techniques, tools, customs, culture, etc. 
in a FOSS development environment, which may provide them with the urge 
and skills to involve themselves in FOSS development.  Of course, this 
will also help them in whatever commercial job they get into.

The syllabus given here is also nice.  But, in my personal opinion, it 
may better be called a *system administration* course, since it is more 
oriented towards _configuring_ certain applications/server/etc.  Of 
course, units like Linux OS Kernel, network programming, compiler design 
and programming tools are interesting.  But is the time enough ?

This is just my personal opinion.

> I want to know what are the possible reasons of router connection failure
I dont have a listing of reasons for failure, but here is how to
generally troubleshoot linux router issues.

* Check if the routing table has the entries to the destination
network/host. (use route command)
* Try pinging the destination.  
* If unable to ping the destination, try pinging intermediate routers, if any.
* Try traceroute to see if any routers are blocking filtering traffic.

I cant understand what exactly you mean by "router connection
failure".  Also, if you have hardened your linux router, make sure the
iptables/tcpwrappers allow packets from the destination.

If these dont help you, then you could try posting more specific
information regarding your setup.

Hi,

6 hours? Are you kidding?

This is a good chance to bring in excellent courses to
bridge the gap between the academia and industry.
Don't _ever_ make the mistake of having only theory. 
Focus on practials.

Compare yourself to the standard of Universities
abroad. If you come to the industry, you have to meet
high standards. 

Most operating system courses, are atleast two levels.
Understanding of the Linux kernel needs to be made
into two courses: Operating Systems I and Operating
Systems II, with 20% theory and 80% practical
coursework. Prerequisites (in order): Programming in C
-> Data Structures -> Device Drivers.
 
> Network programming:
> Networking implementation under Linux, Socket

This needs to be a separate course. You can use
Richard Stevens UNIX Network programming for
reference. This is a laboratory course: 10% theory,
90% practicals.

> Embedded Linux and Device drivers:
> Components of embedded Linux, Embedded Linux Kernel,

8 hours? You gotta be kidding me.

Make this course as device driver programming course.
Needs to be a separate course: 20% theory, 80%
practical.
 
There is no embedded Linux. Linux is the kernel.
GNU/Linux is the entire system. Depending on where you
use it, it becomes a desktop/server/embedded system
etc.

Again, universities like Rochester Institute of
Technology, have three courses, System Administration
I, II and III. 
 
Use this to get an idea:
http://www.it.rit.edu/~netsyslb/net_sys_index.html

You can incorporate GNU/Linux servers/administration
pertaining to understanding the RFCs in the relevant
coursework.

> Servers 
> Email, Web, Samba, Squid and Application server
> setup, TCP/IP Firewall
> setup, IP Accounting. Code review on Apache (Web
> Server) and Module 
> development - 6 hrs

You can put this under any of the system
administration courses.
 
> Compiler Design - 4 hrs

It needs to be a separate course. Follow Aho, Ulman
book on Principles of Compiler Design. Use lex, yacc,
flex, bison to write a simple compiler. 
 
> Programming tools
> Make, Lex, Yacc, Perl, Python, scripting, Tcl/Tk) -
> 5 hrs

These should be incorporated in the coursework
mentioned above, not as a separate course.

I would recommend you look at universities in the US,
Germany, Australia etc. to see how they do more
practicals than theory. This is what the industry
expects. To learn, you need to use GNU/Linux tools to

The syllabus needs lot of pruning.  That's why I sent a mail to ILUGC,
LUG Bangalore asking for suggestion.  Looks like my mail gone to
/dev/null

Personally I want to see the following topics: (need to sort it out
later based on the avl. timing).  It can be divided between the 2
electives (45 hours each).


- Brief overview of Free and Open Source Software and their differences

- Brief overview of GNU, Linux and BSD Operating Systems (no need to
go into too much details)

- Brief overview of FOSS licenses.  2 or 3 examples like GPL, BSD,
Creative Common License, FDL

- simple tutorial on shell scripting, and basic UNIX commands (to
refresh them).  Simple tutorials are enough.  Tell them where to look
for further information.

- how to use make, diff, patch

- Simple tutorial on software configuration management. How to do
basic operations with CVS.  For more details they can refer CVS
manual/HOWTO.

- How to file Bugs.  Simple example of filing a bug.

- Brief Introduction on Dual booting, using LILO/GRUB, partitioning.

- Brief intro on file system used on FOSS OS: ext2, ext3, ufs,
reiserfs, loop mounting (don't go into too much details)

- A demo on Linux installation (FC3??)  and FreeBSD Installation

- A demo on Live CD (Knoppix) - since that is highly useful for
emergency trouble shooting, etc.

- Introduction to run levels and various configuration files for basic
operations

- Introduction to TCP/IP networking, using network tools such as:
ifconfig, iwconfig, tcpdump, ethereal, netstat, route, traceroute,
ping

- How to set up dial up networking and using minicom

- Set up a simple web server, telnet/ssh server, ftp server, samba
server.  Tell them where to look for more details for advanced
configuration.  Based on interest optionally can have lab exercise on
setting up a simple mail server, DHCP server, DNS server.  Remember
all these should use simple configuration to avoid confusing them. 
Later they can always pickup from manual/howto for more advanced
config.

- Brief Intro on Localization and Internationalization (don't tell too
many details).

- Brief Intro on Xfree86, GNOME/KDE Desktop Environment

- How to do kernel compilation for fine tuning (add/remove modules).
Linux can be used for example.

If still time left, you can include one unit on FOSS use in embedded
systems.  Either uclinux or RTLinux can be used for demo.  The
Institutions can buy ARM7 based simple demo board (like the 8085, 8086
uP kit they use in the lab) for lab expt.  It won't cost much .  This
embedded system area is growing very fast where lot of skilled labour
is needed, I feel this should be included.  I am sure students will
easily pickup wherever there are interesting practical experiments.

These are my preliminary thoughts.  We can refine the syllabus and fit
it into 45 hour slot after the discussions and feedback from others.

these are not what would go into an engineering syllabus, even for an
elective

if you are designing a linux course for a training institute (sort of like
niit or aptech but much more competent) then your syllabus would be good

I do agree that these sysadmin type modules are not really what's needed in

not to mention that they've already used these before, if they've been
writing unix code anywhere (note: not just the gnu toolchain, there are
lots of other toolchains that people would definitely have to use at work,
so while it is ideologically tempting, dont just stick to one toolchain)

advice would be to fork the course into two parts - compiler design,
embedded systems using linux etc in one part and the general sysadmin /
usablity stuff like configuring mail and web servers in another part.

Hmm., I dont think that people get `flame`d the first time when
they do something like this. They are usually corrected., the
flaming starts only when someone gets totally irritated about it
because of repeated violation, and some rare cases when he/she had
a bad day. ;)

I think the mailing list introductory mail tells about posting
rules. (if not it should be put there). I've seen people
conveniently ignore that entire mail, and walk in all-proudly and
do mistakes irritating other people here.

Ok, disk space is getting cheaper but surely the strategy you suggest

surely other mail clients should start giving this functionality! Or

By list-ettiquette am suggesting that the rules are not just 'laid'

This is specific to the disclaimer issue:

1. It is definitely a company requirement to have such things
attached to any email coming out of their systems.
2. The legalese in those is considered
	* Irritating by many
	* An imposition by many
	* Anyway unenforceable
	* My take is that it forces me to take a position about
	the legality of someone stopping me from  using/forwarding
	the advice/suggestion on the list; which I find distasteful.
3. Many such companies also prohibit employees from using
yahoo/other mails.
4. So such lug members are 'forced' to impose their footers and
disclaimers on the rest.  Those among the rest who don't like
the idea are asked to put up with it or explain kindly (for the
nth time) and so on.
5. My pov:
	Such people should post to the lug from outside office
		 or
	Accept other peoples admonitions.

Those who think this is an extremely harsh stance, please
reconsider the language of such disclaimers. It violates
the spirit of a LUG (IMO) and tries (however ineffectively)
to bar the very interaction which is is the mission of a LUG.

I agree. That is why I don't use the official ID for

Software tools, if used, are at a very
basic/introductory level, except, maybe the IITs,
RECs, and few other institutions.

During the talks last semester, I asked the students
on how many hours they spend in the lab. They said 6
hours, two lab sessions per week. This definitely has
to change. At work, on an average, we spend atleast
12-14 hours per day before the computer.

If you take a compiler design course, one needs to
basically implement a compiler, or, some phase of the
compiler as a module. If you take an operating systems
course, one needs to implement a filesystem or
scheduler or one component of the operating system as
a module. You don't need any state-of-the-art
equipment to learn. Even on an PII x86 with GNU/Linux,
you can learn all these.

It will be good to have loads of practical work in the
coursework in a majority of the educational
institutions in India. Even if it is not brought in
the near future, it shouldn't be an excuse for the
student for not learning. It is their future and their
responsibility to take the initiative to learn. If
they don't make use of the time, it will be extremely
difficult for them to catch up, when they join the
industry.

Just my thoughts,

SK

That is the point I'm trying to make too.  I must clarify that I have no
hand in the framing of the syllabus (neither the draft, nor the final),
and so my influence with Anna University is the same as everyone else's
-- exactly zero!  Apparently, the draft is just some arbitrary starting
point for a debate.

I think it's important for students to get a historical perspective, in
spite of the argument that it has no place in a technical course.
Mention must be made of the licences but there would be no point in 
splitting legal hairs between them.  Of course, this will have to go into
the classroom course -- I can't imagine doing practicals on the GPL
except if were a lawyer ;-P !

Autoconf-automake-libtool should be included as well.  I am aware that
there will always be advocates for other build toolchains, but since it 
is not possible to cover them all, and since the autotools are the most
widely used anyway, autotools it will have to be.  CVS (no, not svn :-)
!), gnats (no, not bugzilla :-) !), and diff/patch are an absolute must.
Naturally, all this goes into the laboratory course.

I think we should lose that compiler design unit.  Nothing useful can be
said about compiler _design_ in 4 hours and I think that time can be 
used more productively elsewhere.  Anyway, since the CS curriculum is
already supposed to have a separate compiler design course, I don't see
the point of talking about it here.

... with exercises using GNU gettext and also some of the
standards/RFCs involved.

The success of the programme will depend crucially upon the kind
of `experiments' that are done in the lab course.  If these are
intelligently designed, I think students will have a better than even
chance of making useful contributions of their own in FOSS. 

So, question to gluggers: what laboratory experiments would you like to
see?  Specific examples would be nice.

Later,

Anand.

I fully agree with you, regd. historical perspective.

We have to just tell them what each of this license is and the
differences.  Forgot to add LGPL.

20 to 30 minutes on this topic is enough.  This topic is not for
examination but just for awareness.

When it comes to examination I am afraid of the kind of 
questions the students will face. Question setter should 
understand that the students mind are not database and questions 
like "what is the command line option for unified diff" should 
be grossly discouraged - What purpose the manpages are for.

The quality, over a long, period will be evolved only based on 
the type of questions asked in the exams. This ask for a greater 
role for the staffs aswell. Whatever the syllabus is arrived 
after the debate, care should be taken that quality is imparted.

No mistake with you. This is the default behaviour of 'host' 
command. When you give a server name in dotted decimal it 
performs a reverse DNS. Since you dont have a reverse DNS entry 
for the ip provided, the lookup fails.

Hello Friends

My friend has got a new system.He would like to have a distro installed not
a Live CD.He has not used Linux much though he has little knowledge of it.
Which one should he go for. Debian Sarge or Fedora Core 3. I would be doing
the installation for him. Which one should i install and he has got BSNL
Data One so i guess apt-get install or apt-get update would be a breeze but
other than that which would be the apt distro.

Regards
Balaji

Similar discussions has come up many times earlier in this list. 
Asking others to select a distro for you is like giving others 
_the_ chance to select _your_ dress. This way you are 
sacrificing your freedom of choice.

Since I am given this chance now, I would happily ask you to go 
for Ubuntu.

That doesn't help at all. 

What is the system specification? Is it an x86 or AMD
or powerpc or risc? How much RAM does it have? What
motherboard? What hard disk? What dvd/cdrom drive?
What partitioning scheme do you intend to have? Do you
want to setup a multi-boot system? What is it you
intend to use the system for?

Please provide full details while asking a question.

Subject: [Ilugc] [Etiquette] Don't top-post
Message-ID: <000001c5564c$2cea8f40$5125e2dc@i0r1b2>

I never thought this was an issue but after this discussion I checked
the list I frequesnt now (ofbiz.org) and found it was all top-posts
there! And the discussions there are far from inactive!

-----------------
You refer to some other mailing list and trying to transpose the rules to
this list!
> No, that just makes it even worse.
> Not everyone has GMail and not everyone can refer to old mails just to
follow a discussion.
> Imagine a thread with more than 100 posts.Do you want a person to refer to
100 mails just to find out who has posted what, on a particular topic.

Ok, disk space is getting cheaper but surely the strategy you suggest
is a guzzler.  I dont suggest that everyone starts using GMail but
surely other mail clients should start giving this functionality! Or
does this feature depend on Google's search might!
-----------------------
It is not only that everybody does not have Gmail, but many pepole have mail
clients wich follow the threaded architecture (I don't). For them,  it  will
be a real irrritant.

And you are asking this functionality to be provided in a mail client, that
people having Gmail need  not bother, so on so forth, but fellow listers
point out about top posting, but that small step  to be avoided is so
difficult  for you !
-------------------------
> There is no specific "ilugc list-ettiquette", we just follow rules that
have been laid down to make e-mail easier to read.

By list-ettiquette am suggesting that the rules are not just 'laid'
down but also linked to on the website so all can read.

Subject: [Ilugc] [NRC-FOSS] RFC: Syllabus v0.2.0
Message-ID: <d5ua3t$n7a$1@sea.gmane.org>

Based on feedback received in the previous thread on this topic, here is
a revised outline of the draft syllabus.  Many thanks to all those who 
contributed to the discussion.

This is the first iteration of what will hopefully be a useful set of
suggestions to take to the meeting on Saturday as the consensus position 
of ILUG-C.  We can now debate the utility of each of the points below.

The additions/modifications are divided into sections to facilitate easier
referencing.  Every point is up for discussion, except II.0 which cannot
be modified.

For background information on the NRC, see http://www.au-kbc.org/nrcf/.
These pages will be superseded by C-DAC's FOSS portal when it comes on 
line.

Just to give you an idea of the sort of curriculum followed by most AU
students in their BE (CSE) course, I've also included the curriculum 
taught at the MIT Campus of AU in semesters I-VI.  CEG and AC Tech. may 
have a slightly different curriculum.  Please note that this curriculum 
is representative, not definitive.  The course under discussion will be 
offered as one of the electives for semester VI.

This is a unique opportunity for the community to do something about
university curricula in India in an area that is of vital interest to
everyone.  Let us provide constructive feedback so that we can achieve
this goal.

Many thanks and best regards,

Anand.


RFC: FOSS Course Syllabus v0.2.0

Action is required on:
1. Further pruning the syllabus, Section IV, to satisfy the 45-hour requirement.
2. Dividing contact hours for classroom/lab sessions for each unit.
3. Any other changes found necessary.

-------------------------------------------------
Proposed changes to the syllabus. 

I. Objectives
=============
0. To develop a broad understanding of FOSS activities and methodologies.
1. To enable the student to become proficient in the use of FOSS tools and
   development methods to the extent that she is able to make useful
   contributions to FOSS projects.

II. Structure and scope
=======================
0. Total contact hours: 45 (NB: this is really a constraint!)
1. The course will have regular classroom sessions as well as associated
   laboratory work approximately in the ratio 1:3.
2. Students who opt for this course will be expected to do their final year
   and pre-final year projects in a FOSS-related area using FOSS tools
   and methods.

III. Canonical Platform
=======================
0. The distribution used to illustrate and implement examples and
   exercises will be Debian 3.0r5 (`Woody') (or whichever is the latest
   stable version at that point) for GNU/Linux systems, and FreeBSD 5.4 (or
   the latest stable version) for BSD systems.
1. Where it makes sense to do so, the canonical platforms will be assumed
   to be i386-pc-linux-gnu and i386-pc-freebsd.

IV. Syllabus
============
0. Overview and history of FOSS -- the UNIX heritage of GNU and BSD; FS
   licences; some prominent FOSS projects and resources. (1 hr.)

1. System Administration -- installation; the boot process; shell 
   scripting; user management; device management; network configuration;
   setup and configuration of mail/web/telnet/ssh/samba/dhcp/DNS servers.
   (? + ? hrs.)

2. FOSS Programmers' Tools -- make, flex, bison, m4, sed,
   gawk, bfd, ctags/etags, binutils, textutils, diffutils, etc.  (? + ? hrs.)

3. FOSS Development Methodology -- versioning (cvs); build and
   configuration (autotools); bug tracking (gnats); l10n and i18n (gettext);
   introduction to savannah/*forge; testing (DejaGnu); brief introduction to
   porting and cross compilation tools (crosstool); brief introduction to
   POSIX.  (? + ? hrs.)

4. The Linux Kernel -- compiling the kernel, kernel tuning; what are
   kernel modules, simple exercises; overview of the source (aprs Lions' 
   commentary but scaled down drastically).  (? + ? hrs.)


End of proposed changes.
------------------------------------------------


Representative BE (CSE) Curriculum at MIT:
------------------------------------------
Legend: LH=lecture hrs/wk; TH=theory hrs/wk; PH=practical hrs/wk;
P=practial/lab course; T=theory/classroom course. (Don't ask me what's the
difference between `lecture hours' and `theory hours!'  I think that was a
typo in the original that probably stands for `tutorial hours.')

I think now I understand what is top posting. On reading the other
thread on top posting(I read it partially), I thought that top posting
means replying to an old mail in the thread instead of the last one.

Dear Srikanth,
If you take your zealot's blinkers off you'll notice I've stopped
topposting after there were quite a few mails riling against it. To be
precise, from may 9 onwards.

> Please go through ILUGC guidelines  fully and then come back here.

Thanks for the advice. After doing a Google search for ILUGC
guidelines, I eventually went to the guidelines page and did notice
the advice against top posting. Incidentally, there was also a
guideline which said 'dont over-quote'. So one really has to read 100
mails (OK with a reasonable amount of quoting say 50 mails) to
understand what the thread is about (and not heed Toufeeq's advice
that all 100 mails get quoted...... lest you get riled by someone else
for 'over-quoting'!)

I was hoping an interesting discussion would ensue when I suggested
that other mail clients also emulate GMail's features and raised a
tech question whether Google's search might is behind the mail threads
feature (I dont know! I have not tested its features). But
unfortunately, clouded minds seem to only latch on to questions of
etiquette (or 'perceived' lack of it at least after may 9) and miss
the larger questions raised!

If those souls wounded by my previous topposting will not heal until I
apologize: SORRY. Pls get on with life.

With reference to the top-posting vs down-posting - would appreciate if
these discussions stopped soon. Lets just use a format which takes the
least amount of space and is the easiest to read. Thanks.

Sridharan - With reference to the AU syllabi - 45 hours is too little to
cover such a wide range of topics; would be better to slim down the
syllabus considerably so that at least one topic gets sufficient coverage.

Also about the representative MIT (AU) syllabus, are you sure those are
the hours? how does one cover data structures in 3 hours? If this is
indeed truly representative, it goes a long way in explaining the abysmmal
quality of engineers who land up for interviews.

that is 3 hours per week for theory and 1 hour per week for practical.
 Roughly 11 weeks per semester will be available for a course.

Almost all of the courses are bound to 45 hours at the maximum.

This book was named after his essay "Hackers and Painters" 
(http://paulgraham.com/gh.html) which is, in a way pretty popular. Only, 
it doesn't stand in front of a *real* hacker and painter. Maciej 
Ceglowski was a painter before he became a hacker. A pretty good one at 
that. Here's his article refuting Paul Graham's article:

Just to put things in perspective ;-)

NRCFOSS is proposing 1 elective or 2 elective?  I am under the
impression it is going to propose two electives.  In that case, what
is going to be covered in the 2nd elective?

One example of setting up a basic firewall either in Linux (iptables)
or FreeBSD.

Details of telnet, ssh, DHCP, SMTP, IMAP/POP, DNS at protocol level
should be covered in network courses and hence should not be repeated
here.  Here the focus will be on, how to set it up using FOSS
softwares.  Only a brief intro wherever it is needed.


> 2. FOSS Programmers' Tools -- make, flex, bison, m4, sed,
>    gawk, bfd, ctags/etags, binutils, textutils, diffutils, etc.  (? + ? hrs.)

Mention about "cygwin" tools, since it is also heavily used for
carrying out FOSS projects from Windows for various reasons.

How the exam is going to be conducted?  Theory or Practical?  In case
of both, what kind of theory question will be asked?  It can be made
as another Lab course where continuous assessment is done, like for
e.g. Microprocessor Lab or Network Programming Lab course.

-------
Any unit on FOSS usage in Embedded/Real time systems?  May be building
a RTLinux image with a simple root file system and basic networking
utilities and a hello world application.  ARM7 demo board can be used
in the lab.  It will help them to take embedded systems project also
in the final year.  Here we should not focus on Embedded system
concepts or RT concepts, instead how to build the firmware for such a
system using RTLinux.  The limitations between normal Linux and
Embedded Linux can be explained.  If you dont want Linux, then netBSD
can be also be used for embedded systems.  I think too many OS in a
single course is not good and hence if possible we can stick to
RTLinux or ucLinux.

I personally think this should be an interesting lab experiment for
the students, since they will be more curious to see linux running in
the demo board.  It may trigger them to play  with Linux based PDAs or
Routers (like the Linksys wireless router).

Looks like many topics suggested here can better be put under a
"GNU/Linux System Administration" course.   So why can't that be a
second elective ?

Other FOSS topics should better be as general as possible - ie, not
just talking about Linux and not just specific to any particular
application.  That will tie them to those particular applications -
same as what M$ had been doing.

Many of these students may be more interested to write free software
for windows.  (This may not sound pleasant in ILUGC list, but this is
the reality.  Sometimes, limiting discussion to just linux and linux
related stuff can keep out some students.  The aim here is FOSS
promotion - not Linux promotion).

This is not enough.  In my opinion there should be a thorough
discussion on the Licencing issues.  A good comparison of not only
FOSS licences, but also proprietary licences (and semi proprietary
licences).  This is important since this _is_ what makes the
difference between  FOSS and any other Proprietary software.  I would
suggest 4 or 5 hours - with some case studies.


Also missing in the draft syllabus is a discussion on *The Economics
of FOSS*  - in short, how to make money with FOSS. 
Misunderstanding/misconceptions prevailing in this area makes many
people run away from FOSS.  Here also we can have some case studies -
each student can analyse the business model of one company like
RedHat, etc.  Or we can just put this as a case study by students and
then them presenting - with no classroom teaching by teachers.

I think this will be the most difficult issue to be agreed apon by any
University.  But it should be radically different from our traditional
examinations.

A good idea.  This was in the first version (or v0.1.0 ??)

Two: one in sem. VI and another in sem. VII.  Both these courses will
have a classroom component as well as a lab component.  The draft for the
second elective (sem. VII) that has been circulated has some really vague
stuff -- DBMS, middleware components, SOA, J2EE, SOAP, etc.  In short, it
is full of the latest industry buzzwords.  I find it very hard to correlate
with FOSS activity although, to be sure, there are FOSS projects in those
areas, and there are lots of people clamouring for `enterprise-level' FOSS.  
Maybe this is a good thing, but anyway, that syllabus is not up for 
discussion this week.

I really have no clue whether NRC-FOSS will be setting some guidelines
about exams/assessment and also lab exercises.  My opinion is that the
theory exam, if there is one, should be of the short answer type.
Memorising command options must not be required.  Questions must be
problem-orientated, perhaps of the type `write a small HERE-document that
does foo.'  This is the most crucial part of the course.  Even with the 
best syllabus, if the delivery is flawed, students will not only learn 
nothing, they may even become anti-FOSS, like the way many are anti-maths 
and anti-`theory'!

I like this idea.  The only question is where to fit it in.  Logically,
it should come after the unit on Linux.  How to satisfy the 45-hour
ceiling?  What to leave out?

Later,

Anand.

Since the elective is on FOSS should not an hour (the first) be
dedicated to inform the students about FOSS philosophy, the motivation
for contributing to FOSS and perhaps even business models that are
based on FOSS!

Paul Graham has a really inflated view of his talents .. and seems to believe
bayesian filtering is a cure all for spam.

I was in boston in late 2003 .. I and a few friends went to a "meet the expert"
type meeting he was speaking at, and asked him a few questions he wasn't too
happy with ..

Well, I don't know about that!  Often, the best way to kill a student's

I am not all that sure that NRC-FOSS will end up promoting FOSS, after 
all.  In fact, they may have better success by banning FOSS altogether 
in the university curriculum on the grounds that it corrupts the moral 
fibre of our vulnerable youth :-D !  A ban is what will make FOSS really

AU, I know that they will meekly surrender and do whatever they are

What do you mean, spam?  Didn't you know that Bayesian reasoning is the
cure-all for _all_ human problems, including Chennai's water problem
which is a result of Bayesian thinking by Bayesian humans living in a

Evidently, your sense of irony and humour is not compatible with mine,
but we will let that be :-) !  I was taking barbed swipe at AU and its
culture!

Anyway the point is, this is true not only of AU, but of almost any
institution whether it is in academia or industry.  Ignorance and
individual malice has little to do with it.  By the very fact that it is
an institution, it institutionalises and bureaucratises (if I may make up
such a word) modes of thinking that do not promote creativity.  This is
inevitable (I might almost call it a natural law of degeneration of
institutions, somewhat like the second law of thermodynamics) and it
happens even in the NITs and IITs, even the very best of foreign
universities.  It is no use whining on ILUG-C about sadistic faculty
members.  The only people who can break this mould are the students.  
If students really want to be `non-conformant', as you say, and they
really care about things like freedom and other things, why isn't there
that air of defiance and creative rebellion on AU campuses?  Where is the
buzz that one expects to see on college campuses?  Why do I get the
distinct impression that students have little other than their CGPAs on
their minds?  I don't see too many students who are animated by deep and
abiding passion.  Why?  Unless this happens, no amount of _promotion_ of
FOSS by the govt., or the university, or NRCF, or FSF, or anyone else,
is going to work in this country.  Students need to sit up on their arses
and think hard about what they want in life.  This may not happen in a
day.  What is required is nothing short of a grassroots revolution
of sorts which would reach beyond the educational institutions and into
the general population via the students: the goal will be achieved, and
you can rest on your laurels only when your grandma is able to expound
on the benefits of using GNU/Linux!  If you're more ambitious, you should
not stop till your grandma can write a how to do a Canadian-cross gcc
build!

Later,

Anand.

Agreed.  Now, this particular course that we are talking about is 
supposed to be an *elective*.  This means that only those who are

	<quote from your other mail [OT rant]>
	`non-conformant',... defiance and creative rebellion, animated
	 by deep and abiding passion, ...
	</quote>

will ever take these courses as their choice.  Others will safely select 
those other courses which they feel are safe.

Now, what we are trying to do is to suggest a syllabus that will not 
only aide their passion and their determination to do something 
different, but also help them learn/understand certain issues, 
techniques and tools that are prevalent/relevant in the FOSS culture.

That is why, I feel that it is useless to have certain "System 
Administration" topics in this course - this, they can get in any Aptecs 
and NIITs.  Look at what issues lack understanding (or should I say 
"issues that are misunderstood"?) elsewhere (ie., the industry, 
academia, media, etc).  Look at what are left out elsewhere (ie., in 
other courses).  Don't make it just another boring course.

Touch!  We need a course that is Disruptive (with a capital `D') but
one that appears, on the outside, to be an `easy' course -- otherwise no
one will take it!  That is the thin line we have to walk :-) !  But
seriously, I think these are not totally incompatible: it's possible to
make the course attractive and fun without diluting the content.

Yes.  I will also be stressing this point tomorrow.  It looks like there
are so many things we want this one course to be :-) !  I will try to
post another revision of the syllabus later tonight.

Subject: [Ilugc] Linux device drivers: code examples
Message-ID: <20050512150926.28622.qmail@web50204.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

The original code examples of Alessandro Rubini and
Jonathan Corbett's "Linux Device Drivers" were too
long with lot of ifdefs, and I found it difficult to
follow them. 

Hence I decided to modify them, and also write simple
application code wherever needed. There are 14 driver
examples that have been written and tested for the 2.4
Linux kernel:

hello-ex1/
  init_module and cleanup_module

current-ex2/
  prints current process PID

register-chrdev-ex3/
  registers character driver

param-ex4/
  passing parameters to a driver

read-ex5/
  reading from the driver

readminor-ex6/
  reading from a specific minor number

write-ex7/
  writing to a driver

writeminor-ex8/
  writing to a specific minor number

kmalloc-ex9/
  kmalloc usage

ioctl-ex10/
  simple ioctl example

waitsleep-ex11/
  sleep and awakening example

fasync-ex12/
  asynchronous reader example

sbull-ex13/
  simple block device driver

snull-ex14/
  simple network loopback device driver

The examples don't cover all the aspects of Linux
device drivers, but, are meant for newbies who are
entering into the field of device driver programming.

You can get the above code examples from here:

http://www.shakthimaan.com -> Downloads

I would appreciate any feedback/suggestions w.r.t the
above.

With regards,

SK

Even students suffer from the same (attitude) problems as the MS swearing
managers do; they just do not want to move on to a new way of life. Even
some CS students I've met gave me a lacklustre response about their
knowledge of GNU, Linux and the like. Most of them haven't even heard of
sed, awk, Vim and Emacs!

As a student who is exposed to GNU/Linux etc., I can assure you that there
are a few (like me) who advocate GNU/Linux to elders, the GNU/Linux
grandma, I feel, has to wait for at least a few decades.

Like ? Just Curious, you know. That kind of anecdotal evidence leaves
you wondering ...

Bayesian spam filtering was a big improvement, though it may not be an
answer to all questions - But then, which technology is an answer to
every problem ? Achievers like Paul Graham usually tend to have
inflated egos and hold forth on a range of topics, many of which they
know nothing about  and push their own agendas. Eric Raymond's essay
on "How to become a Hacker" is a great example.   It's for the
discerning reader/listener to winnow th chaff from the corn.

Excellent level headed post, this one and Sureshs' -  good to know
that folks are not drinking directly from the "open source

Anyone with a real job , try telling your boss not to top post ;-)

To anyone who might be able to throw some light on this,

I am just curious as to how much real research happens in universities
like IIT and Anna University. I would like to hear from people in these
places - having been to the other MIT (Boston, no - I didn't study there),
but from what I have been able to witness, the amount of research and
development going on there far outweighs anything seen in any of the IITs
or any other educational institution there.

I have gone through some of the IIT websites (IIT Madras especially) and
there is very little being said about any department or any work going on
there. When I look at the profile of professors in IIT (by which I mean,
the number of papers published in top journals, the number of real-world
technologies produced etc) and compare that with that of the people in the
top tier US schools, the disparity is stark.

You can verify this quite easily by just visiting any of the IIT websites
and comparing that with even the second tier schools in the US.

Disclaimers:
1. I don't mean to be trite or patronizing. This is an honest question.
2. I am probably quite misinformed about this.

I ask this because I think it is vital that we develop a culture which
nurtures great research in this country - I can see that this is starting
to happen, but I am wondering where it is happening the most - in industry
or in academia. This question might be stupid and I do realise that this
is perhaps not the right forum for asking it, but it is atleast somewhat
on topic considering that we have been discussing the quality of students
vis-a-vie professors in AU.

Thanks and regards,

Dear Mr. Prem Kurain,

Any Inventions/Discoveries happens after a long and hard strants of
work. The Universities and colleges are places where sparks/lights are
being poured. The students who wipes it becomes an inventor.  No one
knows when a spark will happen in human brains.  Website is just a
visiting card. We have enough work to do rather than updating website.

Just few days back you would have heard about 10,000 Rupees Computer
(Linux Enabled ) Just a sample for you....Where many universities are
involved.  If you pierce into technology/invention/ sites you will
probably land up in an university website only.... just reverse your
thought.....

FYI

Putting together a computer at a low cost is somewhat complex and I
understand that there is some of research involved in it, but that is not
core research. That is to mean that no significant technological
breakthrough resulted from it. Here I am basically interested in hearing
about research where such significant breakthroughs result which alter our
lives (atleast those of geeks) in a fundamental way - example, the
invention of the X-windowing system, Ethernet, Laser printing, DES, RSA,
WiFi, Internet..etc.

Please note that I am in no way trying to belittle the achievement of
those who built the low cost computer (whose progress I have been watching
with some interest); I am just trying to explain my question better.

Also, I am primarily interested in hearing about research conducted in
academic institutions - I am fully aware of the research happening in
companies here these days. There is a lot of good research happening in
Biotech now, for instance.

Prem

I think it is mostly because the websites are not up to date with the
research going on in the institute. I can talk only about Aero/IITB,
but what I have seen there is second to none. Remember our own LCA and
the missiles that keep launching themselves and the satellites and the
indigenously built passenger plane and so on? IITB's hands are behind
each of those projects. Then there is this: http://www.zeusnumerix.com

Message-ID: <4283D827.9000006@gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to set up a common email client which will pull emails 
through pop and store them in a central storage. It should also store 
all the sent emails in the same common storage. These emails will then 
be accessible from different email clients (outlook express and 
thunderbird).

This is required because different members of my team would like to 
check and respond to emails for the same account (xxx@yyy.com). At the 
same time, we dont want multiple responses to be sent for the same 
email. If one has sent a reply to an email, the other person should be 
able to read what was sent and not send another reply.

thanks.

Is this post OT? 

Your requirements look very similar (or exactly) to what a mailing
list setup provides? Mailman (http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/) is
your friend.

sounds like a job for either

1. IMAP, with the sent messages also stored on the imap server and you can
look them up

or

2. A ticketing system like RT

The word 'inevitable' is anathema to any society's progress. More so
in the FOSS society! And I guess equally so in institutions that are
involved in research that will carry our society forward. In industry
a company that is too bereaucratized will just whither away. Law of
natural selection. Unfortunately, in academia, like in the case of AU,
'natural selection' has been curbed and they just turn into resource
guzzling monsters far removed from their original mission. One might
even say it is working against its mission of producing thinkers!

It is not sadistical faculty, but the administration and the culture
that makes such sadistic faculty feel at home. I'll give an example:
MIT (Mass) for all its institutionalization still fosters rebellion. I
mean not just the students but the administration itself. I read
somewhere that at MIT climbing on to the top of the main building is
not permitted and any student who still manages to climb becomes an
icon (RMS says they are hackers too). Some even put up grafitti there.
Administration just forwns... no action taken against that 'hacker' .
Imagine someone writing something on CEG's dome!! Am sure he/she will
be suspended and perhaps even failed a couple of semesters. So, pls
stop blaming the students for this state of affairs. Tell the students
that they can buzz all they want and that the occassional
transgressions will be pointed out benignly you'll hear the liveliest
buzz ever. But tell them you want 'pin-drop' silence and then complain
you dont hear the buzz.... i do not know what to say.

Agree with you about the revolution but no use putting all the

Binand - thanks for the information; yes, I have been aware of the work of
IITs in the projects you have named. And thanks also for the zeusnumerix
link - it was very encouraging to see the work being done there.

Please do understand that my contention was not that no research is
happening in IITs, just that it is far less than what I have seen abroad.
The difference is especially disproportionate in the IT and Telecom fields
- so many indians are in these fields but even the Dutch, Swedes, Finns
and the Norwegians with far fewer people are ahead of us in conducting
core research.

There could be many reasons for this - one important one being that
companies in India have not seen R&D as a core activity and are therefore
not willing to invest in either doing the research on their own or in
acquiring research from academic instituitions like IIT and IISc.

I am personally aware of this reluctance on the part of the industry -
ISRO has been trying to monetarize many cutting edge technologies without
much success. As a result of which, the culture of research even in
leading academic institutions in india is still nascent - especially
collaborative research when more than one person is involved.

Anyway, I shall not belabour this point any further. Please do email me on
my personal ID for further discussions since I don't want to use up this
forum for that.

Thanks and regards,

Try something like smtp.gmail.com:587

1. upgrade the qube 3 to use a more usable distribution of linux - i
think rh 7.3 is the last version that you can safely install that, and
then a ton of security patches on top of it

after that - search google for whatever else you want to install.
mailscanner comes with detailed instructions, and they're too long to
type here.  So stop being this lazy and search google for download URLS
and instructions

hi all,
 I am unable to kill a process in <defunct> state (i.e Zombie state). Even I issued 'kill -9 pid' command, but no effect.  (the process is 'bash',  created by ssh ). But, I see the process is dead after some time.
  any solution?  & why this does happen?

You cant! Technically speaking, the process doesn't exist anymore.

The parent process hasn't reaped the dead child process on time. This
happens if the signal-handler of the parent process (which is responsible
for trapping SIGCHLD signal) isn't invoked when its child processes die.
Again, there are many reasons for this situation to arise - some reasons
that I could immediately point out are:
    * The parent process could be stuck in some form of dead-lock.
    * The parent process could be stuck in a CPU-intensive task.
    * The CPU load is abnormally high.
    * A bug in the code/design of the program that does the forking.

Of course, there are other reasons that I would've missed. In any case,
having a zombie process that vanishes on its own after sometime isn't
much of a trouble.

The trouble is only when these zombie processes pile up over time
flooding your process table entry. In such a case, killing and
restarting the offending parent process should do the trick
(yet the better solution would be to fix the bug in the offending
program).

Hope this information helps.

Short answer: find the PPID of the process (ps -ef and look in the
PPID column of this process) and run:

kill -CHLD <ppid>

If that doesn't work, just kill -TERM <ppid>; kill -CHLD 1

Long answer: A process becomes zombie when it has finished execution,
but the parent process has not "reaped" the child process. Typically,
any process that spawns children has also got to install a signal
handler for SIGCHLD, and reap the children within the handler (using
one of the various wait() system calls).

A process can become a zombie if (a) the parent process does not have
a proper SIGCHLD handler installed, or (b) "forgets" to reap children.
The first kill above deals with (b), and the second deals with (a). In
essence, if the parent of a process is also dead, init (PID 1)
inherits the process, and usually does the right thing on the arrival
of a SIGCHLD.

Hi all....

I have a HP Deskjet printer, installed it on my PC running FC3. I used the 
portal http://<host name>:631 to install ( connected to the USB port 
/dev/usb/lp0 ).

I installed it through this portal since it failed detecting the printer 
in /dev/usb/lp0, when trying to install manually.

Now, any documents I send for printing (command line or GUI ) , its 
getting queued. 

What would be the problem ?

Sudheer

Don't just imagine, do it!  But on the other hand, merely writing
something on CEG's dome just for the sake of writing something on CEG's
dome won't make you an icon.  To my mind, you'd probably be just a 
publicity-seeking exhibitionist :-) !  Which is all right because then
I could completely ignore you!

Would you be surprised if I told you I'm a student at AU-KBC and
still on the right side of 30 (though not 25 -- but I'm not such an
`oldie' yet, you know!)?

I'm trying to say that the `oldies' won't ever share it.  They don't care
and they don't matter.  So there's no point whining.  You have to save
yourselves.  And you can't save yourselves unless you think big.  If
there's one phrase that can sum up all that is wrong with the current
crop of students, it is a total lack of ambition.  I think you'd be
better icons to your fellow students if you had had the courage to aim
for something bigger than your selves, and if you'd had the courage to
be ready to sacrifice _everything else_ in pursuit of that aim.

I dream of a time when even grandmas will be able to cross build and
bootstrap gcc like they make dosas today, of a time when they will exchange
Python recipes with their neighbours!

Actually, I am looking for a way to download all my emails that I 
currently recieve into some kind of a server running on the company's 
local network. Then members of my team should be able to access  the 
emails through their email clients running on the same network and then 
reply to them. The replies should be visible to all the other members.

this is primarily because our company has limited bandwidth and we get 
hundreds of emails.  we dont want everyone downloading these to these 
individual desktops and send replies on their  own clashing with other 
replies sent from the team. I am not sure if i can access the emails 
that I currently get through IMAP (most probaby I cant). i think the ISP 
provides only pop access.

thanks

Subject: [Ilugc] [GLV] Meet: Saturday, May 21, 2005 (Ma Foi Academy)
Message-ID: <20050514175417.59670.qmail@web50205.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

We will be resuming our GLV sessions from Saturday,
May 21, 2005. Our next meet will be at Ma Foi Academy,
Chennai. I am planning to do a talk on "Introduction
to LaTeX". Or, if anyone is interested in giving a
talk, do let me know.

We will begin our new initiatives after the talk:

a. database review: We will review the database of
companies who use/develop GNU/Linux. Right now it is
available at:

http://www.shakthimaan.com -> Database

We will constantly refine it in course of time. This
is a work-in-progress. 

b. company review: In this session, we will research
about a company: products, careers, skills required,
locations, contacts etc. 

If possible, we can also invite people from the
companies to explain to us on what they are doing,
what they expect from prospective students, their
products, services etc.

We can also look into recent news updates or
announcements of walk-in-interviews or ads.

c. skills review: In this session, we will look at the
skills required for a particular designation, how you
can keep your skills updated, understand interview
questions, etc.

If anyone would like to share their interview
experience, we can do that too. 

We also need to prepare a database of questions that
are frequently asked, and that each one of us are
expected to know. For instance, if a skill requires C
programming, then, the database will contain problem
questions on C code. 

d. project-work templates: In this session, we will be
designing/discussing project-work timeline schedules,
where a newbie or an expert can use it to complete a
project. 

The project can be a final-year project or a learning
experience project to be done at sourceforge.net. We
can discuss on the resources/links that can help us to
learn (for example php), the ways of getting help from
the community and so on. This will _not_ be an
advisor-student initiative, but, a means by which you
can get help from the community as such.

Regards,

SK

Hi all,

I have 2 ISP connection connected to the system with Fedora core 3 in
it.  This is the network plan.

                              __________

In eth0 'A' I have the IP 10.0.0.1 and a virtual IP 192.169.0.1. Now
the plan is to make the 10.x.x.x n/w use ISP1 in eth1 'B' and
192.168.0.x n/w to use ISP2 in eth2 'C'. I tried SNAT and iproute2,
but was not able to use them properly. Can any one give me an the
commands? Does SNAT need any configuration to be done in sysctl or
/proc?

Are you able to configure 1 connection.? 
You have to enable ipforwarding in sysctl.

The three categories of C functions are
1, Function that dont accept any parameters and returns no value.
2, Functions that accept parameters but returns no value.
3, Functions that accept parameters and returns a value.

These are more like prototypes. 

Prototype is the right word to use in such contexts.
The word 'category' doesn't really reflect anything
w.r.t. to C functions.

Here goes...

ip rule add from 10.0.0.0/24 table lan1 prio 100
ip rule add from 192.168.0.0/24 table lan2 prio 100

ip route add 10.0.0.0/24 dev eth0 table lan1
ip route add 192.168.0.0/24 dev eth0 table lan1
ip route add default via <def.gw.ip.isp1> table lan1

ip route add 10.0.0.0/24 dev eth0 table lan2
ip route add 192.168.0.0/24 dev eth0 table lan2
ip route add default via <def.gw.ip.isp2> table lan2

The two routing tables (lan1 & lan2) are identical, except for the
default gateway. The two rules tell the system which routing table to
use, depending on the source network of the traffic.

I expect you can figure out the SNAT part.

I can't imagine where you got this gem from. Why stop here? Why not have:

Functions that accept an int and return nothing
Functions that accept a char and return nothing
Functions that accept a struct and return nothing
Functions that accept a pointer and return nothing
Functions that accept two ints and return nothing

and so on ad infinitum.

And who is that? Did he also tell you that void main(void) is OK? Does
he follow Kanetkar's books and make you include conio.h in every
program? Does he tell you not to refer to K&R, it is too difficult to

Better end this thread here. He is a professor in some college. He may
be teaching it as part of the syllabus. I don't know his name and it

It should be as simple as:

modprobe st
tar cf /dev/st0 /path/to/backup
mt -f /dev/st0 rewind

The rewind command will eject the tape once rewinding is over.

Looks to me this cannot be done from entirely within cron. I think the
best way is to run your script from cron every Saturday, and let the
script decide whether a particular Saturday is the last of the month
or not.

Hi,
 I think my problem is similar. When i download a file to the desktop it is 
visible not the next moment after the download is completed. I can see the 
downloaded file only after i restart the xserver. So I checked with the 
rpcinfp -p, there is no sgi_fam or fam in it. how can we start fam ? Which 
is the package we have to install sgi_fam ?
Regards 

Hitesh

Hmm. Ugly it is :)

I was thinking of a code snippet like:

set `date '+%d %m %u'
case $2 in
    01|03|05|07|08|10|12) start=25;;
    04|06|09|11) start=24;;
    02) start=22;;
esac
if [ $1 -ge $start -a $3 -eq 6 ]; then
   # We have last saturday of month
fi

With the logic implemented entirely using shell builtins - no spawned processes.

The skype faq has how to start it ..

1. use the OSS drivers (snd_pcm_oss, snd_mixer_oss) & oss device (/dev/dsp)
2. start skype using esddsp /path/to/skype

The skype website has a faq for linux

You need the path to the berkeleydb lib directory in ld.so.conf

Then run ldconfig once you have edited that file

Though if you have berkeley db libs already around in your distro it makes
sense to use those (db4 and db4-devel in redhat / fedora, different stuff
in other distros)

If you're using Arts or ESD, kill them before you connect. Also, be sure that 
you've got the Alsa-OSS compatibility turned on in the kernel (Either as a 
module or inbuilt), before you start skype.

Hi Manivannan,
I used the same command line as yours it downloaded for me and it didn't 
show any problems ... 
i use the wget version 1.9..
$wget -r -U Mozilla 
http://www.netbeans.org/files/documents/4/442/J2EE-NBTutorial.pdf
I think (not sure) the problem should be the as part of some older version 
not supporting redirection.

Regards

Hitesh

Throw your web designers out and hire people who know html and web 
standards better, not just point click drag drop in frontpage types

That should solve your problem

It is highly probable that the site you are developing isn't
comformant with W3C standards. Try validating your website
via http://validator.w3.org/ and fix the broken HTML
appropriately.

Hi all,

  content of  temp.txt.
one two three
one two four

If I give position to the above file It has to add 10 Spaces from that 
position.

For example If i give the position as '9' for the file temp.txt
After using the sed by giving temp.txt as a input then the file should be

one two                       three
one two                       four


I want the above result for the file temp.txt


I mean after the 

with warm regards,

I dont know much about FreeBSD so I won't be of much help in this.
Better you should try at FreeBSD mailing list. There seems to be a 1.4
version available(http://www.freebsd.org/java/dists/) but it is not
stable. Some other links are
http://www.freebsd.org/java/ this contains lot of info on Java support
on FreeBSD.

Yes, pick up the Linux version and install Linux binary emulation in
FreeBSD. Works like a charm.

cat filename |sed "s/^\(.\)\{9\}/&         /"

Change the 9 to the amount of characters you want and after & the number
of spaces you want

Message-ID: <20050517203901.18263.qmail@webmail50.rediffmail.com>

Hi,
  I have been trying to install ffmpeg version 0.4.9-pre1. i used the command 
  ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared

This is the command given in the documentation.
 it gives me an error saying
 that 'avcodec.h : File not found'. but this file is 
there under the folder /libavcodec. 'make' and 
'make install' also give me some errors. 
i downloaded this from sourceforge
and i need it for my project to convert raw audio to
 mpeg-4 audio. 
it is available at 

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=16082

could you please tell me what is wrong
with this and how i can install it. i need to install it on 
either a redhat 9 or a fedora core 3 system.

You may be able to get most of the files needed from
http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/debian, but for othrs, you necessarily have to
go to cdimage.debian.org.

There are three tables available with iptables
    1. NAT
    2. Filter
    3. Mangle

In simple,
1. NAT table is responsible for address translation
2. Filter tables is responsible for Filtering the packets
3. Mangle table is  responsible for packet marking

There are many chains available,  such as prerouting, postrouting, INPUT, 
FORWARD, OUTPUT.

PREROUTING and POST ROUTING are only used by NAT and MANGLE tables.

PREROUTING  takesplace before all the routing table processes.That is, when 
the packet is arrived at your gateway, before that packet is processed, it 
gets done with the PREROUTING rule.

POSTROUTING takes place when the packet goes out from your system, that is, 
after all the processing and when the packet is about to leave the system, 
the postrouting rule will be executed.

There is a flowchart in the following  link which will give you  the overall 
packet flow in the iptables.

Message-ID: <1116400407.11761.234386387@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hi,
I came across this question in C faq's.
Could some one explain the #define statement specified below.

2.14:   How can I determine the byte offset of a field within a
	structure?

A:      ANSI C defines the offsetof() macro, which should be used if
	available; see <stddef.h>.  If you don't have it, one possible
	implementation is

		#define offsetof(type, mem) ((size_t) \
			((char *)&((type *)0)->mem - (char *)(type *)0))

	This implementation is not 100% portable; some compilers may
	legitimately refuse to accept it.

Thank you,
Mohammed Riyaz P.

This takes the address of the field within the structure, and
subtracts the address of the structure itself. The difference is
assumed to be the offset of the field within the structure.

1                      2                    3                     4
|----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
start of struct/        start of field2      start of field3       end
start of field1

(view in a fixed-width font please)

If you need the offset (in bytes) of say field3, then you can see from
the figure that it is the address of (3) - the address of (1).

Subject: [Ilugc] CD for Grab - Expansion
Message-ID: <20050518080245.13178.qmail@web50207.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

The "CDs for Grab" page has been very useful.
Recently, I had sent CDs to friends at Pondicherry,
Trivandrum and New Delhi. It takes only about Rs.25/-
to Rs.50/ - to send a set of CDs through SpeedPost. I
received blank CDs in exchange from my friends. Fair
enough.

I am wondering if we could expand the "CDs for Grab"
page to spread across the different cities/states in
India. 

Let's say person A, living in city X can't find a CD
that he wants or doesn't have the time to download it.
But, he/she is going to city Y for a conference. If he
finds a person having the CD in city Y, he can get it
from him. Especially in the industry, when you travel
a lot, and don't have time to download ISOs, this
information can come in handy. We can also simply ask
them to mail the CDs, and we can send them blank CDs,
in return. 

This will definitely be a huge database, considering
the number of cities in India, and the areas within. 

I see two methods of implementing this:

1. Sourceforge.net project:

We can maintain a repository that contains the list of
people with the CDs they have, and other relevant
details. Of course, a person needs to be able to
download this huge file. This is better than having to
download sets of CDs.

2. Online:

We can implement this database online, so that,
through different search methods, the database will be
searched, and list of entries will be displayed. This
can also be a final year project - writing the user
interface (php) and connecting it with the database
(mysql).

Maybe, phase I can deal with expanding the databse
with data from different cities in Tamil Nadu. We must
make requests to different LUG group members to add
the list of CDs they have to the "CDs for Grab" page.

We can then expand our database to the states of
India. 

In course of time, we can span across countries and
finally continents!

Any thoughts?

Yeah i understand that, but i dont understand the #define statement

#define offsetof(type, mem) ((size_t) \
                       ((char *)&((type *)0)->mem - (char *)(type *)0))

Basically, what you should remember is that the binary -> operator is
essentially an offset-operator, in the sense that it just figures out
the offset within a structure of its member. Instead of 0, you could
pick any address - for example, if you had a declaration like

type *fubar;

You could very well have written the above macro as:

size_t offset = fubar->member - fubar; /* disregarding all the casts */

and gotten the same result. The whole idea of using 0 address is to
make the macro portable across all structure names and members.

It should be noted that nowhere in the macro does it -dereference- any
pointer. If it were doing that, you'd get segfaults. The -> operator
does not dereference.

The idea of casting to char * is also a portability trick - ISO C of
today would require using void * (or not using a cast at all). If you
remove those casts, the macro becomes very much readable:

((type *)0)->mem - (type *)0;

Which is almost identical to what I gave you above with fubar. :)

Well, this makes perfect sense. But,

dosent make any sense to me. isint (type *)0 a null pointer??  so how is
it possible to offset mem, when we dont even have a structure there??

It probed the monitor as unprobed monitor. I don't
know how to specify the monitor type.

In Windows XP the Display card is Mobile Intel(R)

But in linux it shows as. 'lspci'
VGA Comatible Controller: Intel Corp Unknown Device
2592
Display Controller: Intel Corp: Unknown device 2792.


Even linux did not probed the Dell Wireless 1350 WLan
Mini-PCI Card (as per Window XP)

linux shows Wlan card as: 'lspci'

CardBus Bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1510 PC Card.

Plese help to configure monitor type, VGA card, and
WLan.

Thanks in Advance.

Best Regards.

Just to add what has already been pointed out earlier in this thread, it
doesn't make sense only to *dereference* a null pointer.  It's perfectly
legal to do arithmetic with any number of null pointers -- which is what
we're doing here.

IIRC, the rationale (on the dkuug site; the section that deals with
library headers) says somewhere that the reason for including this
macro in stddef.h is to have a generic way of computing member offsets in
programs that use a large number of structure names: it is useful to
have routines that work with only the *structural* information of the
structures, and not on the structure declarations or structure names
themselves.  This way, even when you add new structure names to your
programs, routines that worked by computing member byte-offsets will
continue to work without modification or recompilation.

There's more in the rationale on portability and other equivalent
examples of how this could be done, but I don't recall that now, nor
have the patience to look it up :-) !

HTH.

Anand.

Probably not the answer you are looking for, but I think you should
try with FC3 (or if you are brave enough, with FC4test3). Newer
hardware -requires- newer distros :)

You have to keep in mind two things.

1. Data structures exist only in the brain of the programmer. As far
as the computer is concerned, it is all a stream of bits (logically
ordered into bytes).

2. A pointer is a memory address. As with any kind of sequential
addresses, it has to start somewhere - and 0 is as good a place as
any. Thus, memory address 0 is a perfectly valid address (though
usually not within your program's realm).

So, combining the above two, if you want to consider the next
sizeof(type) bytes starting at memory address 0 as a data structure of
type type, you are perfectly welcome to do so. It is only when you try
to -access- those bytes (by dereferencing pointers) that the
OS-enforced memory protection kicks in and you start getting
segfaults. But you are allowed to do pointer arithmetic with those
addresses without the OS frowning at you (pointers - memory addresses
- are just unsigned longs in my linux x86 box, I can certainly take
the difference of two unsigned longs - who's stopping me as long as I
use the ISO C ptrdiff_t type to store the difference?).

You can try http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net and run the windows drivers

It'll require you to repatch your fedora kernel to include a 16KSTACKS patch

Hello,

I would like to have a multiboot system with Linux, FreeBSD and Windows
2000.
I use a Dell AXi series laptop. It has got 20GB HDD and 192MB RAM.

I installed Windows first on 4GB, used the remaining space and made a 10GB
partition
and installed RedHat 9 with GRUB. Now Linux and windows are working fine.
While doing
a partioning in Linux installation I allocated the remaining free space for
FreeBSD and finally
installed FreeBSD. But after reboot I see only Linux and Windows in GRUB and
I don't know
where FreeBSD has gone. Could you please tell me where I went wrong or lack
something?

Thanks,
Franklin

You need to manually add the entry for Freebsd in the grub config file
which will be something like

title   FreeBSD-5.21 x86
        rootnoverify    (hd0,3)
        chainloader     +1
        BOOT

replace (hd0,3) suitably

<tongue-in-cheek>
Actually, this is caused by a nasty bug called Windows 2000.  Just get
rid of it and GRUB should detect your FreeBSD installation just fine.
</tongue-in-cheek>

But seriously, how on earth is GRUB supposed to know that you installed
FreeBSD?  Magic :-)???  R the `Booting' section of TF GRUB M for what to
do to your grub.conf to boot FreeBSD from GRUB.  BTW, what you get to see
at boot time is not GRUB but just a menu interface to GRUB.  The
difference is enormous, you know ;-) !

HTH.

In one of my installs, I had set it like this in
grub.conf:

  ###Title FreeBSD 4.9###
    root (hd0,2,a)
    kernel /boot/loader

===================

strings - Print the strings of printable characters in files.

Summary:

For each file given, strings prints the printable character sequences
that are at least 4 characters long & are followed by an unprintable
character. Strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of
non-text files.

Example:

$ strings /bin/ls -- Prints the strings from initialized & loaded
                     sections.

$ strings -a file -- Scan the whole file for the strings.

$ strings -f /bin/* | grep Free -- Print Filename before each string.

$ strings -t o file -- Print the offset within the file before each  
                      string [o = octal, x = hex, d = decimal].

$ strings -n 10 file -- Print sequences of characters that are at
                        least 10 characters long (Default 4).

NOTE:  Write one "Hello World" Program in C and try this command on
the binary file(a.out) of that program.

Hi Veera,
                            
      There are 2 type Of NAT(Newtwork Adress Translation)
               1.SNAT(Source NAT)
               2.DNAT(Destination NAT)
      
   Source NAT is when you alter the source address of the first packet:
  i.e. you are changing where the connection is coming from.  Source NAT
  is always done POSTROUTING, just before the packet goes out onto the
  wire.  Masquerading is a specialized form of SNAT.
         For example 
                         Any Packet coming form your  internal
netwwork(192.168.0.x) comes to your  firewall box , where the source
address of each packet can be changed according to the rules specified
in the NAT tables.When the packet leaves the box its source address
will be changed to new one.
 
  Destination NAT is when you alter the destination address of the first
  packet: i.e. you are changing where the connection is going to.
  Destination NAT is always done before routing, when the packet first
  comes off the wire.  Port forwarding, load sharing, and transparent
  proxying are all forms of DNAT.DNAT is always done with PREROUTING

eg         iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -j DNAT --to 10.1.1.1
              (Change destination addresses to 10.1.1.1)
Any packet coming to   your interface "eth0"  will be routed to another 10.1.1.1

AFAIK, ext2 only marks the inode deleted without zeroing out the block
pointers, whereas ext3 also zeroes out the block pointers.

Yes.  mc's undelete command can do it on ext2 partitions.  See also the
undelete FAQ at http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Ext2fs-Undeletion.html

Huh???  Did I understand you correctly?  Or were you asking for something
to securely wipe your files?  There is shred, of course but there are a
lot of situations in which this not secure enough.  Or else, there
is PGP, for example, or even wipe (wipe.sourceforge.net), and there are a
lot of tools that claim to do similar things, but beware of snake-oil!
You may have to do some research before you can really convince yourself
that any purported wipe method is secure enough.

HTH.

your kernel .config sure ...

or you can compile it externally, copy it to that directory and then
modprobe, insmod etc from your initscripts / modules.conf

Mr Anand Babu (FSF-India Member) has developed the BiosConfig tool,
which reads/writes fields in the CMOS non-volatile store, most of
which are associated with various functions of the BIOS. 
URL: http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/biosconfig

One Day One Command
===================

tac -- Concatenate and Print files in reverse order.

Summary:

`tac' copies each file to standard output, reversing the records
(lines by default) in each separately. It is doing the reverse
function of the CAT command (TAC).

Example:

$ tac myfile -- Print the file (Line by Line) in reverse order.

$ tac -r -s '[^a-zA-z0-9\-]' myfile -- Print the file (Word by Word)  
                 in reverse order, by passing the Regular expression.

$ tac -r -s '.\|' myfile -- Print the file (Char by Char) in reverse 
                            order.

Read: man tac

how can i do that ?

Yes.You need edit the *Makefile* under the
/usr/src/linux.x.x/driver/net/wireless/ directory.Also You need to edit
the* Config.in* inside the same directory to get, "Module Enabling
option" when you do make menuconfig/xconfig. Then you can continue with
default steps from make dep.

Let me see one example like,In Linux-2.4.25 how Cisco/Aironet PCMCIA
802.11 wireless cards driver has implemented.

The driver source code should be placed as below.

*#cp  airo_cs.c  /usr/src/linux-2.4.25/drivers/net/wireless*

airo_cs.c is not using any seperate .h file. It just using kernel
existing headers like,<linux/netdevice.h>,<asm/io.h>,<pcmcia/cs.h>..etc.

Perhaps,If you have any seperate header files with your driver code, you
need to copy that header files,inside the /usr/src/linux-2.4.25/include/
directory.Then give apropriate path in the driver souce code ( example
if header file airo_cs.h is inside the  include/linux/drivers/wireless
directory, then you need to edit in source code as
#include<linux/drivers/wireless/airo_cs.h>)      

Edit /usr/src/linux-2.4.25/drivers/net/wireless/Makefile and add this
line as,

*obj-$(CONFIG_AIRO_CS)           += airo_cs.o airo.o

*Edit /usr/src/linux-2.4.25/drivers/net/wireless/Config.in and* *add
this lines as,*
 
# If Pcmcia is compiled in, offer Pcmcia cards...
if [ "$CONFIG_PCMCIA" != "n" ]; then
   comment 'Wireless Pcmcia cards support'

   dep_tristate '  Hermes PCMCIA card support' CONFIG_PCMCIA_HERMES
$CONFIG_HERMES
   tristate '  Cisco/Aironet 34X/35X/4500/4800 PCMCIA cards' CONFIG_AIRO_CS
fi

*These line will help you to get "Cisco/Aironet 34X/35X/4500/4800 PCMCIA
cards" option when you do make menuconfig.

If you wish to provide help document associated with this driver when
you do make menuconfig then append your info in
/usr/src/linuc-2.4.25/Documentation/Configure.help file.

Select this module thru, make menuconfig -> Network device support ->
Wireless LAN -> Wireless PCMCIA support.
Finally use the default commands set to complete kernel compilation (
make dep bzImage install modules modules_install).    

Thanks,
bharthix.

i386 sources can be optimized for i686 using the compiler flags, yes.
Binaries targeted for 386 will run on 386 or above without
modifications, too. With minor slowdowns.

btw, rpms usually contain binaries and only the srpms contain the
sources. If you are looking for sources, rather get the tarballs.

Start here -> http://www.gentoo.org/

Alternatively, you might also be interested in http://www.archlinux.org/  
(i.e., if you dont have patience compiling each and every software, and  
tinkering with various compiler flag settings).

I don't know anything about MiniWeb. I just tell you, how to setup the
tunneling interface in Linux.

1) insmod tun
2) mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200
3) chmod 666 /dev/net/tun
4) tunctl -t tun0
5) ifconfig tun0 192.168.1.100 up

There is a facility to limit the CPU time and memory size consumed by
a process. See setrlimit() system call man page for details. You can't
set usage based on percentage, however.

It actually does not make sense to limit a particular process to 85%
of the CPU. Most of the time, CPUs spend time idling. During that
time, it would only be wise to let the program use up full CPU and
finish sooner.

However, if system responsiveness is the problem, then you can try the
"nice" command. The nice command reduces the process's priority. Thus
when you run the problem program with nice -n19 <program>, the
process' priority is lowest. When you start another program, it
usually starts as a normal priority program and thus is provided with
more favor and is scheduled more often.
At the same time however, when there are no other processes to run,
the problem program runs, utilizing full CPU. This is much better than
fixing the % of CPU a process can use.

Please note that, however, if the program in question is very resource
hungry, uses up a lot of other resources other than CPU like memory,
etc, then you are in trouble again. The nice command affectes only CPU
usage.

There are a few kernel hackers researching on class based resource
allocation. There were patches avaiable as well. Using these patches,
I think you can limit resources based in network usage, cpu usage,
etc.. I read this long back and can't guaruntee its correctness.
Please google.

Hi,

> The Master disk alone gets detected.

Try out the command:
$ dmesg | grep hdb

and see if there is any output. If you have SCSI, replace hdb by sdb.
If there is output from this command, then it is likely that your hard
disk got detected. But are you aware that you need to mount your hard
disk partitions before you can use them?

Yes. In the GNU GPL there is no point saying that all free software
must be called as GNU.
It would be absurd.
Linux distributions are made by taking free softwares like linux
kernel, and other GNU utilities and packaging them right. It is the
right of the company to call the product in any way they want.

Try 

fdisk -l
sfdisk -s

check whether any other partition/disk is listed other
than your master disk.

if listed it means it has been detected. you just need
to mount it

Freedom is precisely that. Let people call it the way they want to. Its
important that we have more & more users and "known success stories" for
linux to become a household use. 
Once people see its power, they stick to it. So, let's show them the
power ( & now the beauty of the graphics) and let them use it.
I prefer calling it Linux, but if someone gains happiness in life
calling it Gnu/Linux, I don't care, as long as we don't force each other
to adopt another way.

One Day One Command
===================

shred -- Overwrite/Delete a file securely.

Summary:

Overwrite the specified file repeatedly and remove, in order to make
it harder for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the
data.

Example:

$ shred file -- Repeatedly overwrite the file content with random data.

$ shred -v file -- Show progress info.

$ shred -n 5 file -- Overwrite 5 times instead of the default is 25.

$ shred -x file -- Use exact size. Don't round of.

$ shred -z file -- At the end of shred, overwrite the file with zeros.

$ shred -u file -- Overwrite, Truncate and Remove the file.

Read: man shred

Yes, there was no need to be surprised upon reading it. It was just a
statement of facts in a clear and consistent way.

I'd rather say RMS is biased not the author of this article. And the
statements made in this article are in no way irrational. This can be
taken seriously, just as people tend to take the RMS talk seriously.

You can not simply add directories inside the kernel source directory
and expect things to compile automatically.

The driver/net/wireless/Makefile will usually have the targets to compile.

>From what you have said, it looks like they request you to put the

Well, try compiling the modules from outside the kernel source
directory, in case it compains then make the xxx dir under wireless,
and re-run make in that dir.

> Is there anything to add in Kernal Makefile ?.

Yes - but most of the times the coders will give you a working
Makefile which takes care of compiling the modules without editing
Makefiles, unless you did not get a production status set of files.

Boot into your system with a bootable CD, like Knoppix. Try the following:

Mount your Sarge root to /mnt/hda(something). You should know which
partition Sarge is present on. Then, say chroot /mnt/hda(n), and say
grub-install /dev/hda.

Subject: [Ilugc] Microsoft buying out Red Hat ??
Message-ID: <428F6D8F.6080100@gmail.com>

Hi,

This news item (read rumour) seems to be making the wave among the OSS
bloggers lately.

I picked it up from Ian Murdock's blog,
http://ianmurdock.com/?p=207

further probing lead me to the actual sources, the Ziff Davis Network..
here are a couple of links to ZDNet OSS blogs..

http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1369
http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/index.php?p=274

Also CNet seems to have dedicated a news item..
http://news.com.com/A+Microsoft-Red+Hat+warming+trend/2100-7344_3-5701700.html

At first, this looked like FUD spread over what could have been a casual
meetup between two head honchos of tech firms.But on analysis MS buying
out RedHat seems like a good idea after all(for MS obviously).

** It stops IBM in the Server OS market.
** It gets a foothold in the OSS market
** It gets to have better operability with RHEl and Win NT
** It has nothing to loose other than a couple of billion $$ but in turn
  remove a big splinter that's been a pain for the last couple of years..


Coming back to the OSS Community, how much should this worry us?
If MS buys out RedHat, who will be next? Novell ?, Mandriva?
Is MS just going to buy out its competition till there's none left to
stand up against it ?

your comments.. ?

Hi

I tried to install OpenLX in my system (Intel PIII /RAM 256 MB/ HDD 40 GB).
It has Win xp and MDK 10.1 with Grub. I wanted to replace Mandrake 10.1 with
OpenLX. The installation started smoothly and went upto time zone selection.
After that it failed to detect any of the exisiting ntfs / fat32 / ext3
partitions and gave a warning message to create new partition. When I
clicked No, the installation got terminated and the system rebooted.

What do you suspect is the cause?

Subject: [Ilugc] FLOSS, how the term came into being...
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.60.0505230108180.1148@news.goa.bytesforall.org>

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOSS

Free/Libre Open Source Software
>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
Redirected from FLOSS

The term Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS as different from FOSS) is  a 
hybrid term for both free software and open source software, which are 
different terms for the same substance.

"FLOSS" was created as a project acronym by Rishab Ghosh[1] 
(http://flossproject.org/people.htm), and popularised after the European 
Commission in June 2001 funded a study on the subject [2] 
(http://flossproject.org). In July 2002 a survey and study [3] 
(http://flossproject.org/report/) and a report of the workshop [4] 
(http://flossproject.org/workshop/) portion was produced and gave wider 
publicity for the term.

The aim was to create a term which didn't alienate the advocates of either the 
free software philosophy, or the open source philosophy. It was hoped that such 
a term would ease friction between the two movements and thus improve 
cooperation. Indeed, Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software movement, 
has publicly recommended[5] 
(http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/audio/rms-interview-edinburgh-040527.txt) the 
use of this term for those, especially in the research community, who wish to 
appear neutral.

The L in FLOSS is meant to emphasise the "has freedom" meaning of the word 
"free" rather than "no charge" (gratis), while FOSS, for Free/Open Source 
Software, can give the impression that "Free" refers to "no charge".

Some non-English speakers prefer this acronym as it can be translated to 
languages other than English:

 	the F can stand for Frei in German while the L was explicitly
 	drawn from Libre in French and Spanish, Livre in Portuguese, and
 	Libero in Italian, and so on.

At the end of 2004, FLOSS has been used as an English-language term of choice 
in official documents in a number of countries including South Africa[6]

libre/livre software remains the term for free software, avoiding the 
English-language confusion that led to the creation of the term Open Source.

Another term similar in aim to FLOSS is non-proprietary software. Legally 
speaking, however, only public domain software is non-proprietary.

Hi again, 

Thanks for the mail..
>From the steps you have given, I understand tun/tap creates a char
devices at /dev/net/tun

Now why do you have to use "tun0".. 

Is this also a char device as /dev/tun0  which is linked to
/dev/net/tun?

However after running these steps I am able to create tun0 inteface..

But when I run miniweb: which opens /dev/tun0 

I get these error..

Failed IP header checksum, dropping
tun_dev: dev_get: read: File descriptor in bad state
Failed IP header checksum, dropping

that's udev creating the device automatically when you modprobe the interface
and set up a tunnel

dont create a tun0 device yourself

HI again, 

The problem here is I am not able to see /dev/tun0 once I do 

#/sbin/modprobe tun  /* which is sucessful.. and /sbin/lsmod shows that
tun module is loaded..

What can go wrong?

What packages do "udev" come from ..I don't see such ustil in my
machine..?

Let me know..

raja

Message-ID: <20050523065709.GA5189@arkenstone.pvt.u1.newgenimaging.com>

Hi,

Our company requires a number of small/medium projects to be implemented in
linux.

 1. Currently we manage several independent user accounts for Windows, Samba,
    Squid, shell accounts, mantisbt, web apps, etc.  This is a real pain and
    we are looking at centralising all accounts on OpenLDAP.  We are seeking
    someone who can implement OpenLDAP on our debian servers and conslidate
    our user account management.

 2. Jabber client/server implementation for internal communication.  We need
    a server setup on linux with win32 clients (exodus).

Our offices are based in Chennai.  Please contact me off-list with your
proposals if you are interested in taking up any of the above.

Don't worry about udev now. Use the manual procedure.

But I dont want to use public wiki

So, if anybody could suggest a very

wiki or some other tool which will
solve my problem that would be good.

The wiki if runs on both windows

would be very good.

Correct me if any of my assumptions

If the chipset is available in India, it is already available in most
of the tech savvy countries. And surely there will be people working
on something even if no production status drivers are available.

Seriously, this chipset is not that bleeding edge that you are

Am reproducing this from distant memory but I had installed a pctel
internal modem in a linux redhat 8.0 box maybe 3 years back. I got it
from linmodems.org. I also remember a peculiar problem it had: after
you close a connection and then redial the system would hang and will
need a hard reboot. Perhaps it was a hsf chipset! Am not sure.

AFAIK the datasheets for HSP56 pctel modem are not available.
Internal modems are useless chips where most of the work is done in
software so even reverse engineering it is a bit difficult.

Summary:

`md5sum' computes a 128-bit checksum/fingerprint/message-digest for
each specified file.  `md5sum' can also determine whether a file &
checksum are consistent.

Example:

$ md5sum file -- Compute and print the MD5 checksum of that file.

$ md5sum -c input.txt -- Read checksum and filename from the file and 
validate checksums.

$ md5sum -w -c input.txt -- Same as above and warn if the checksums 
                            format is wrong in the file.

$ md5sum --status -c input.txt -- Indicate the status in exit status 
                                  code.

Read: man md5sum

   My Guess is, one of your installed extension is buggy. Few days back i had
   some different problem where in whenever i selected extensions or options
   menuitem from tools menu , it creates an invisible modal window and i
   cannot click anywhere in the application window, and it renders the whole
   browser as useless. I am sure it was caused by any some buggy extension
   (at that time i had nearly 10 extensions, few were useless).

   Here two things can possibly done.

    1. open you browser in safemode. Here the browser will disable all your
       extensions. Now try using update.
    2. If it still creates problem, the last resort is to reinistall your
       firefox again. But be sure to do this after reinstalling,

         1. First unistall the firefox
         2. copy your bookmarks.html and pref.js from your personal profile
            folder to some safe place
         3. delete your personal profile folder and the main application
            folder (for example, at c:\Program files\Mozilla Firefox)
         4. Install the firefox application
         5. Install you favourite but trusted extensions

What do you mean by "Linux based firmware"?

Firmware is flat code, and is different from the layer
of operating systems. I do see a lot of embedded
projects that mention this phrase. If they are simply
referring to using gcc to compile source code (C or
assembly) for an architecture, it is purely firmware
and has nothing to do with the Linux kernel. Or are
they referring to code on a ROM that interacts with
the system?

That's right. I find quite a few devices whose code-in-the-ROM is
basically the Linux kernel adapted for said device.

Brilliant offers a "Bridge" course that students can do in their 10th holidays.

Their actual courses are meant to be done over the 11th and 12th

Ditto with most other IIT coaching shops and inter colleges specializing in
sending trainloads of people to IIT / BITS

Given the "study physics, chemistry and maths [probably PCB in some cases]" and
"argue with your teacher for each quarter mark even if you get 98%" manias that
I saw in several madras schools (PS Sr Sec alumnus myself, so saw a bit of that
first hand before I got out of here) .. probably my advice to get the kid a
linux box and let him enjoy himself in whatever course, then do a BA/BCom, get
an MBA later maybe would be thought heretical.

But I know several IIT alumni who finally end up going through one of the B
Schools and then spend the next few years of their life coordinating field
salesmen in random TN / AP villages, selling Horlicks and Colgate.

So, before you throw the kid into the grinding torture that's an "IIT coaching
class" see if he has a genuine aptitude for the subject.

Language nitpick: He could be doing the same mistake millions of

millions of parents are doing. :)

hi,
i am using RH 9.0 and i have installed 2.6 kernel more than twice and
did work out that smooth for me and "make oldconfig" is perhaps the
worst thing to do it takes more than 25 min to answer all those
questions. also many errors pop up after i install the kernel like "no
support for VFAT",or doesnt detect some of the hardware.do you have
any alternate method for installing the new kernel smoothly without
any errors.

Easiest way to start would be to download a redhat 2.6 kernel srpm and
recompile that (if the redhat 2.6 rpm doesnt work for you) .. or find
someone's .config on the internet, and then do a make menuconfig or make
xconfig based on that

Note - for rh 9 you may need to upgrade a few things before you use a
recent 2.6.x kernel, just check.

Googline for 2.6 kernel redhat 9 should give you more hints than just
asking here

Do make menuconfig and read the help information for each option or If
you want, I can send my 2.6.8.1 .config file (warning ~10 month old).

Lol... I was afraid somebody would pick that up. But I should say, 
brothers tend to do this a lot lesser than parents, because mostly they

Nokia has introduced a neat little Linux-based webpad at

The entire toolchain as well as everything on the device

As most of you probably know by now Nokia announced today the Nokia 770
Web Tablet. This is of course especially relevant for everyone here as
it uses stuff like GTK+, GStreamer, d-bus, gnome-vfs and gconf.

Companies like Fluendo, OpenedHand and Imendio have been involved in
various parts of the development of this device.

The offical page is here:
http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,75023,00.html

With a developer page here:
http://www.maemo.org/

There is also a very nice development environment for this called
scratchbox, which is the one Nokia themselves have used for the
development found here:
http://scratchbox.org/

Nokia will as you know be presenting this device at GUADEC.

Toufeeq

Awesome! A very smart move by Nokia. 770 is definitely on my buy list.

It would be on everyone's buy list if Wi-Fi was more prevalent in Chennai.
What would one do with a Wi-Fi tablet if the only hotspots available are 
at the Airport/Railway Station and coffee shops ?

If it had a cell phone module in it, it would have

But it does have:
* Bluetooth specification: 1.2
* USB device mode for PC connectivity

So, a cell phone with bluetooth or USB connect will
suffice :)

But, we need to be carrying two devices, instead of
one.

  Thanks for the info - this is a really neat device. It would be great
if it had the CPU power and RAM to run a full-fledged browser like
Mozilla/Firefox, but it's probably not there yet.

  Even better if it could run Xine/Mplayer and stream DivX video at
800x480 from an NFS server over WiFi! (Not yet reached that level yet,
but this can be done today with just about any Centrino tablet).

  Perhaps a higher-powered 2nd-generation version, preferably at
the $200 level, will be the killer handheld device.

Well there are few cafe hotspots in Chennai, and it
should increase in course of time. 

I see two setups for home users:

1. An internet connection<-->desktop (router with
wireless PCI/USB card)~~~Nokia tablet

So, you can freely move around in your house.

2. Cell phone(Internet
connection)<--USB/bluetooth-->Nokia tablet

You can freely move around wherever you can get
services from your phone service provider.

(picked from Slahdot)
It seems to be running Opera..
or rather Opera lite.Perhaps, a highly customised version of it.
I remember Opera and Nokia reaching an understanding on the opera browser.

It can play videos but I doubt it can stream them out of the box.
But with the huge support that Nokia is providing for homebrew apps on the
770 I sure people will come up a way to stream audio/video.Afterall it
uses Gstreamer.

The Sony Playstation Portable is another Wi-Fi enabled device that's got 
immense potential to invade the geek market segment.Only problem is Sony
seems to be paranoid about security is playing its cards slowly and carefully.

Agree with you. But even with a combo device, text input (sending
emails) will still be a problem! At least for large sized texts.
Notebooks are not obselete..... yet.

If it was 3G cell phone & WiFi VOIP phone all Internet/phone call related problems 
for the business traveller would have solved.

Ofcourse,this would have also put the phone/tablet out of budget for the common man. :)

I'm guessing they'll release another model 770i within a few months which will incorporate 
mobile telephony features.

Those are the places you typically find Wifi hotspots anywhere
(exceptions do exist).

I just picked this up: http://web.mid-day.com/news/business/2005/may/109655.htm

Airports/Railway stations (and even the trains - at least, the
Rajdhani/Shatabdi variety) ought to be Wifi-enabled.

Dishnet seems to be coming out with this new service called "Red" to 
provide more hotspots.
Does anyone know what are the charges/tariff plans ?

If more such initiatives are started Wi-Fi use will become prevalent
as competition increases.

So in a world wide wimax a Nokia 770 with skype (or similar tool)

Subject: [Ilugc] backup strategy for mail server
Message-ID: <7bf1bec5050526041847c992ad@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Towards evolving a good business continuity process, in my office we
want to backup all mails of all users. Like in a typical office we
have a special list (trivia) where a lot of images, flash animations
and such trivial things get exchanged. We want to have a backup policy
that will leave out these things. Instead of backing up individual
users mail boxes (in their desktop mail clients) I'm wondering if the
following would work:

Have all mail clients configured to leave a copy on the server. Then
every night a script would scan all mail accounts on the mail server
and backup everything  _except_  those that have 'trivia' as its
receipient. After the backup is done, the mails will be removed from
the server.

Would this work? Any suggestion is welcome.

Thanks,
mano

It would, but what if someone didn't turn up on a given day and hence
all his unread mail got deleted by your backup process?

I'd suggest configuring your email server to send a copy of EVERY
email to a particular address (big brother is watching you ;), and put
up a procmail/maildrop filter to drop these trivia emails. Then later
on backup the entire mailbox for this ID.

You don't have to change anything client-side if you do it this way.

Forbes has great reputation as a rag for PHBs.  So is it any wonder
that TFA reflects all the biases of that class?  Losing BK is a
blessing in disguise, and may yet be the best thing that ever happened
to Linux.

Was thinking of deleting mails till a cut off date.. say 2 weeks
before the present backup. Assumption is that no employee will be
absent for so long!

Let me also put in a commercial for Courier MTA, which has this
big-brother feature out of the box (among others :).

http://www.courier-mta.org

#  This is the big-brother option that saves a copy of EACH and EVERY
#  message passing through the system.  Uncomment ARCHIVEDIR, and after
#  a message is delivered, its queue and data file is moved to ARCHIVEDIR
#  instead of being deleted.  You must create the ARCHIVEDIR directory
#  yourself, and it must be owned by the "courier" userid.

Mr Amit Kale has developed kgdb, a source level debugger for Linux
Kernel. It is used along with gdb to debug Linux Kernel.
URL http://kgdb.linsyssoft.com/

One Day One Command
===================

sum -- Compute and Check .

Summary:

`sum' computes a 16-Bit checksum for each given file(s)/stdin. By
default, it computes checksums using an algorithm compatible with 
BSD `sum' and prints file sizes in units of 1024-byte blocks.

Example:

$ sum file -- Print checksum and block counts.

$ sum file1 file2 -- Print checksum, block counts and filename.

$ sum -r file -- Default. Use BSD sum algorithm (1KB/Block).

$ sum -s file -- Use System V sum algorithm (512 bytes/Block).

Read: man sum

If your filesystem is ext2, you can recover the file 
using mc.

F9 -> Command -> Undelete files

Fortunately if you had EXT2FS in RH9 running, you can try LDE [Linux
Disk Editor].

1) http://lde.sourceforge.net/
It has some features for assisting un-deletion, both by walking the
block list for a file, and by grepping through disk contents.

2) And for detail manual process, you also can refer "Ext2fs Un-deletion
mini-HOWTO" in <http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Ext2fs-Undeletion.html>

Best of luck :-)

Thanks and regards,
Saugata.

As the subject says, Newforge reviews Windows XP from the point of view of
a Linux user wanting to switch to Windows:

http://os.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/05/18/2033216

On the whole, it seems to be a fair and unbiased review. The conclusion
is that Windows is not yet reached the point where a switch from Linux
is advisable or justified.

It is very difficult to say any reasons, with-out knowing the usage of
the machine. Anyway some tips.

0) Disk is Full ??
1) Any disk is damaged ??
2) Check, What type of services are running and Stop unwanted.
3) Check services like HTTP, Mailman running ??
4) Check the hourly cron jobs.
5) Remove the unwanted kernel modules.
6) Check the log files and dmesg
7) Closely watch the machine for 1 or 2 days to identify the problem.

Bye :)

Subject: [Ilugc] Italian, Venezulean voices favour freeing knowledge
Message-ID: <200505281016.j4SAGdMu020930@mail8.atl.registeredsite.com>

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, May 28: Publicly-funded content must be openly available, and sharing knowledge only enhances its richness, Italian senator Fiorello Cortiana told a four-nation international conference held in the Kerala capital this morning.

Eminent economist and former Venezuela minister for planning and development Dr Filipe Perez-Marti agreed, and stressed that ?participation, solidarity and wisdom? would be the key three words that characterise a new global situation.

Amidst praise for Kerala for organising this ?first ever? south-to-south contact in the world of free software and free knowledge, speakers from Latin America (Venezuela, and  Brazil), Italy and India explored ways of understanding their respective situations and possibilities for collaboration across the oceans.

The Latin Americans were keen to hear about Kerala's attempts to look at take Free Software solutions to schools, through their IT@School project which aims to train about 200 master trainers, who will then train at least one teacher from each school in the state in the use of free software.

Free Software Foundation of India director Prof G Nagarjuna stressed how India was able to fight-back attempts to make software a patentable item. He said help for this endeavour had come from enlightened politicians, the peoples' science movement, media and others.

Latin American delegates spoke of how their firms ? including the Venezualan oil giant ? had opted for free software, both for more control over their work and avoid possibilities of sabotage in a crucial sector of the economy.

Government of Brazil special advisor in the ministry of communications Antonio Bezerra de Albquerque Neto said Brazil was keen to build links with countries like India and China, and stressed that Free Software is a key means of in building a fairer society.

SPACE executive secretary Satish Babu called this a ?fairly unique event? and said Kerala had a good chance of building itself as a global destination of Free Software. SPACE chairperson Prof K R Srivathsan termed Free Software a ?natural way for the scientific community to play around with?.

Former musician turned Free Software activist Juan Carlos Gentile said he hoped this first-ever meet of its kind ?would lead to many things to come?. Kerala IT secretary PH Kurian said ideas of sharing knowledge were ?not alien? to India, and cited the case of Gautam Buddha who used the people's language to spread his message.

Kerala began this four-nation meet on Saturday morning, and it aims to take the ideas of free software to different realms of society, which can gain from the power of sharing knowledge and culture.

SPACE, the Thiruvananthapuram-based Society for the Promotion of Alternative Computing and Environment, is co-organiser of this event with the global NGO Hipatia (www.hipatia.net) and the Free Software Foundation-India (www.fsf.org.in).

Organisers say that the international free software movement has shown a ?new way of knowledge creation and social ownership?. They're keen to explore how the ?free software model? can be applied to fields as diverse as governance, digital inclusion, development and culture. (ENDS)

each specified file.  `sha1sum' can also determine whether a file &
checksum are consistent. The sums are computed as described in
FIPS-180-1 (www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip180-1.htm).

Example:

$ sha1sum file -- Compute and print the MD5 checksum of that file.

$ sha1sum -c input.txt -- Read checksum and filename from the file and 
                          validate checksums.

$ sha1sum -w -c input.txt -- Same as above and warn if the checksums 
                            format is wrong in the file.

$ sha1sum --status -c input.txt -- Indicate the status in exit status 
                                   code.

Read: man sha1sum

input.txt Format:-

2bff10a7855964335a86e84efb5f4ce9c40d4cfd  file1
e62341664decd9f55896ab3635697de29ed1077f  file2

Hello! You can get the files I used for the presentation from

However, info sed and info gawk will give you more practical and neat examples
as well as a deeper insight into the tool.

A variation of AWK, MAWK is also available. It is written by Mike Brennan. It
is quite similar to the standard GNU awk available with most Linux distributions.

Hi All

I  configured Dataone BSNL Connection in win98. Is there a good HOWTO
specific to how to do it for our BSNL Data one connection?

I was given an instruction only for win98. They do not have instruction set
for Linux.

Can anybody help out?

Okay, I tried ADSL/PPPoe connection in Deb, it tried for Access concentrator
and failed. I tried to make it as a LAN through Ethernet connection, that
also failed to connect to the net.

I have seen an earlier post for UTStar800 modem. What I have is Smartlax
MT800

Please give some pointers, with local specifics.

Thanks in advance

As the subject says, I have for sale the following system:

PII/233 (Klamath) on a Slot-1 i440LX 
motherboard, 32 MB of ECC (!) RAM, 2 GB Seagate IDE hard disk, 
mini-tower cabinet with 2x 5.25" bays, 2x 3.5" external bays, 1x 3.5"
internal bay, ESS soundcard, IDE CDROM, 3Com Etherlink III 
10BaseT card, AGP slot (!), reliable, vintage-1998.

Currently running Fedora Core 3 (!) with most of the bloatware turned
off to get the memory footprint down - it's a good candidate for a 24/7
firewall, router, postfix/procmail server, Samba/NFS server or legacy 
compatibility-testing box.

Asking Rs.4k or best offer for the headless system unit (no keyboard, 
mouse or monitor). Additional spares/upgrades (Slotket, Mendocino
Celeron 400 MHz CPU, ...) available on request.

Please e-mail me off-list if you're interested.

Hi,

On linux, Kino (http://kino.schirmacher.de/) is very good for video 
dumping (capturing) which I have used and can assure you about dumping 
quality. It is supposed to give a lot of good effects in editing too but 
I havent tried this editing part  yet. Kino is free.

There is another alternative Main Actor, which seems to be a faar better 
software. I havent used it. This one is not free though.

Hope this helps,

One Day One Command
===================

cksum -- Computes a CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) checksum.

Summary:

`cksum' prints the CRC checksum for each file along with the number of
bytes in the file. The CRC algorithm is specified by the POSIX Std. It
is not compatible with the BSD or System V `sum' algorithms.

Example:

$ cksum file -- Prints the Checksum, No of Bytes and filename.

$ cksum file1 file2 -- Prints the Checksum, No of Bytes and filename 
                       for each file.

i am unable to ping machine 1.

when i look at tcpdump, i see a lot of arp requests being generated for

two complete arp entries. 

i have enabled ip_forward in both machine 2 and 3. 

Could some one tell me what the issue could be.

In machine 2, you have to do the IP MASQ for 192.168.0.x, use

Iptables is not the panacea for routing problems. Why cannot his
machine2 act as a simple router without packet mangling? On the other
hand, if he goes for masquerading on machine2, his machine3 will not
be able to access services on machine1.

To the OP: You probably -think- you have enabled IP forwarding, double
check that. What does "cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward" say on
machine2?

I was about to ask the same thing. I would like to add that routes for
machine 1 are added on to machine 3.  (which is not shown in my previous
mail. i send wrong config for machine 3 by mistake). so i dont think
iptables masq would be necessary on machine 2.

Can you post the routing tables once again? Or send it to my email
directly instead. Please use the command "ip route show" which has
rather more readable output :)

The routing tables are as follows:

routing table for machine 1:
192.168.0.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.0.1
127.0.0.0/8 dev lo  scope link
default via 192.168.0.2 dev eth0

routing table for machine 2:
192.168.0.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.0.2
172.16.0.0/16 dev eth3  proto kernel  scope link  src 172.16.0.1
127.0.0.0/8 dev lo  scope link
default via 172.16.0.2 dev eth3

routing table for machine 3:
210.210.123.0/24 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 210.210.123.17
192.168.0.0/24 dev eth0  scope link
172.16.0.0/16 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 172.16.0.2
127.0.0.0/8 dev lo  scope link
default via 210.210.123.1 dev eth1

This is not correct. The second line should be:

192.168.0.0/24 via 172.16.0.1 dev eth0

ie, the system does not have a next-hop router address for the subnet
192.168.0.0/24.

(You could just feed that line to "ip route add")

And for machine2, the two interfaces are eth0 and eth3 - what are you
using, a quad-port card??

I did that and now the routes for machine 3 look like this.

210.210.123.0/24 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 210.210.123.17
192.168.0.0/24 via 172.16.0.1 dev eth0
172.16.0.0/16 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 172.16.0.2
127.0.0.0/8 dev lo  scope link
default via 210.210.123.1 dev eth1

but i am still not able to ping 192.168.0.1(machine 1) from machine 3.
(simular situation from machine 1 to machine 3). But i am able to ping
everything else.

Now your routing tables look alright. I am assuming you don't have any
leftover iptables rules on machine2 - in which case, it is time to
refresh your tcpdump and traceroute skills :)

What happens when you traceroute from machine1 to machine3 (and vice versa)?

BIG NEWS ON USA MICROSOFT: Slavery to It Is Ending


Por Clayton Hallmark - Saturday, May. 28, 2005
(Reported on Slashdot)
Mass-produced computers can KILL Microsoft and free the
world's computer users. They'll be too cheap to accommodate MS
Windows -- MS's bread and butter. Computers will go the way of
TVs and VCRs -- cheap offshore (non-USA) production. They'll
be cheap, simple, general-purpose (FREE SOFTWARE), all-
electronic (no disk drive) -- in other words, real electronic
computers, finally. READ ABOUT THE OPENING SHOT, MOBILIS,
FIRED IN BANGALORE, INDIA, ON MAY 26, 2005.

If you like this idea, remember, above all, avoid Microsoft
traps like the "Windows XP Starter Edition." It's a $30 loss-
leader for developing nations -- with price-gouging to begin
soon after. If you are outside the USA, be like Munich,
Germany -- declare your freedom by going open-source for your
enterprise. Beware of the US spies at the USAID and beware
Microsoft's so-called "Local Economic Development Program for
Software," which is insurgent in Brazil and Jordan. Read a US
judge's decision on how MS strangles the US market (http://
www.albion.com/microsoft/) and avoid this for your country.

A respected US group, the Gartner group, warns against the
Windows "Starter Edition" at http://news.com.com/
Gartner+Steer+away+from+cheap+Windows+XP/2100-1016_3-5309139.
html?tag=st.rn .

To read about Microsoft's designs on your country, see http://
news.com.com/A+billion+PC+users+on+the+way/2100-1003_3-
5290988.html?tag=nl . The head of the USAID (US Agency for
International Development) is Andrew Natsios, a nephew of
famed CIA spy Nicholas Natsios.

For non-US persons looking for freedom from Microsoft for
their enterprise, consider the Munich example at: http://www.
usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2003-07-13-microsoft-
linux-munich_x.htm and Germany's example at http://www.dw-
world.de/dw/article/0,1564,568696,00.html . Bergen, Norway's
second city, is planning to switch its computers to Linux.

For balls, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballsmer has threatened Asian
countries -- sovereign nations, mind you -- with lawsuits if
they employ the Linux open-sourse operating system. He
threatens them under the aegis of the World Trade
Organization. http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/
1283010/posts

However, the hundred-dollar Linux computer will be the end of
Microsoft's dominance and possibly the company itself. Do you
care? Can the Indian MOBILIS beat Microsoft? Can Wal-Mart beat
Microsoft in America? Since you are reading this on a
computer, you are a slave to MS and you should care. Freeing
us from MS and its robber baron could raise the US
productivity by several points. It can free foreign
governments from aggression by Microsoft. I'll show how. To
have fun, usable, efficient computers, it is necessary. To
finally realize the dream that Bill Gates aborted, we need a
computer that is: Cheap----Instant-On----Simple----General
Purpose. Only India has one, for $200 ("good globalization").
We (the rest of the world) don't. This might not be the
machine, but more are coming, and they will starve Microsoft.

At $100 or $200 there is no room for Windows, unless MS gives
away its XP "Special Edition" or its CE -- as a trap.

If the computer becoming a commodity is a threat to MS, the
company is only encouraging that trend with its foray into
home entertainment. They are doing this for one reason: to
keep game consoles from competing with PCs and Windows. That's
why you won't see windows on game boxes. This will backfire.
No American company can long make money in the manufacturing
and marketing of home entertainment. It will be "deja vu all
over again": When a new must-have Next Big Thing makes a
market in the US, the Asians make it and take it. (The list is
long and started with the transistor: portable radios, all
radios, B&W TVs, color TVs, VCRs, CD players, digital clocks,
watches, cameras -- and now, the computer.) Home entertainment
systems are a booby trap for American companies and they will
be for MS, too. Microsoft's participation in this will help
ensure the commoditization of computing -- the opposite of
what they planned.

At $100 or $200 there is no room for Windows and Microsoft,
because the price charged manufacturers -- $70 to $83 for each
computer using Windows -- precludes it. That is a tax that
most of us have to pay when we buy a computer. Microsoft also
has a $30 Windows XP version for what they call "entry
computers" in developing countries ONLY -- but it is a trap --
much higher prices, like subscription charges, will follow.
DON'T FALL FOR THE $30 WINDOWS "STARTER EDITION" TRAP! http://
news.com.com/Gartner+Steer+away+from+cheap+Windows+XP/2100-
1016_3-5309139.html?tag=st.rn

$220 AND FALLING

Today's "personal computer" is not even a true computer, in
that it is not a general-purpose device but a proprietary
Wintel (Windows and Intel, working in collusion) device. The
PC is a corrupted version of the microcomputer vision that we
had in the 1970s. I was there. That vision failed when
Microsoft pirated away the microcomputer/small computer/home
computer as we variously called it. I will show that we have
the tools to take back the vision of the computer as a
universally available intellectual tool -- take it back from
Bill Gates, the Blue Beard of computing. I will show that
globalization is not all bad. It will take more than Linux or
free open-source software (FOSS), much more, as explained
below.

Famous computer visionary Nicholas Negroponte of the MIT Media
Lab is developing and promoting a $100 laptop with proposed
specifications including a 500-MHz processor, 1 GB of memory,
an XVGA display, and free Linux. He envisions 200,000,000
million of them being distributed to countries like China in
two years. However, the Indian company Encore Software already
is marking a small computer, the MOBILIS, with much more
modest specs, for about $220. The Mobilis may not have the
features many of you want, but it is a crack in the dam. As
cheap computers flood the US, upgraded versions soon will
appear -- much cheaper because of no MS tax -- and much
better. Both of the above computers employ the open-source
Linux operating system (OS). Walmart.com already sells a good,
cheap OS-LESS computer -- you get to choose one. These
machines might not change the world, and nonproprietary
operating systems besides Linux might become more important,
but all this shows what is coming.


"APPROPRIATE COMPUTING" MANIFESTO: FOR THE MICROSOFT KILLER, I
PROPOSE CERTAIN CORE FEATURES

The Indian Mobilis has some of them. They include:

1. Cheap (nearly free) nonproprietary operating system (Linux
or other) and cheap nonproprietary basic applications -- word
processor, browser, etc. --- This would make the small
computer a general-purpose device, as a computer should be --
not tied to Microsoft, Apple, or Palm. Above all, the small
computer must AVOID MICROSOFT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND BE
ABLE TO PROVE THIS IN A COURT OF LAW. Microsoft basically is a
publishing company full of lawyers. (Did you ever see a
publishing company get this big or a publisher get as wealthy?
Not even Hearst of "Citizen Kane." They exploit the law and
technological ignorance.) Avoid Apple, Microsoft, and all
proprietary software as much as possible. An operating system
is one of those things you shouldn't have to pay for --
certainly not on the basis that the publisher (Microsoft)
excludes other software companies from YOUR computer. You
don't pay for an OS when you buy home entertainment devices
(though some probably would like to put an OS in a kitchen
toaster).

2. Instant-on operation --- no waiting for the OS to load from
a hard drive. Keep the OS small enough to fit economically in
nonvolatile solid-state memory (flash, etc.).

3. At last, an ELECTRONIC computer. --- What we have now, the
PC, includes an electromechanical device, the motorized hard
drive -- an electromagnetic device like the relays in the
Harvard Mark I of 1943. With "general purposeness" and all-
electronic operation (OS on chips, not a disk drive), we would
finally have something that meets the traditional definition
of a real electronic computer. Watch the price of flash memory
go down and you will see the possibilities for taking the "D"
out of "DOS."

4. Simplicity. --- Since the operating system would be on
semiconductor chips, it would be much smaller than the
monstrous "whatever the traffic will bear" Windows. A small
operating system is a simple one. Remember DOS and the early
computers? To start "computing" (limited, admittedly), one had
only to know how to turn on the power switch and insert the
boot disk. Computer simplicity alone could add several points
to a nation's labor productivity.

5. Driver software for common hardware such as Epson printers
and HP scanners.

6. Ability to view, print, edit, and exchange files in
Microsoft formats (.doc, .xls, etc.) and to convert to and
from standard file formats, including proprietary ones where
legal.

7. Ports for expandability to include connectivity (modem,
Ethernet, etc.), hardware devices (printer, scanner, etc.),
and more storage (e.g., Lexar JumpDrives). The Mobilis uses
UPS for expansion.


ARE THESE DESIGN GOALS REALISTIC?

Of course they are, and Microsoft cannot do anything about
this. In fact, their CEO, Steve Ballsmer, says he wants to see
a $100 PC, with a trap, of course: Windows "Starter Edition."
See http://news.com.com/
Gartner+Steer+away+from+cheap+Windows+XP/2100-1016_3-5309139.
html?tag=st.rn and also see http://news.com.com/
Ballmer+We+need+a+100+PC/2100-1012_3-5419179.html.

THE NEWS NOW: India already has the Linux-based Mobilis that
sells for $220US and has its OS on chips -- where, by the way,
viruses can't get to them. It is simple to use because it is a
simple machine. It has to be simple because you cannot build
Wintel complexity into a $200 computer. And you can't build a
MS Windows computer for $200, much less $100. Who needs
Windows? We really need to ask.

FOR AMERICANS: "What this country needs is a good C-note
computer" [says I]. Can we have it? Yes, and Wal-Mart could
bring it to us. With that company's merchandising clout, it
probably could hope to market profitably a small computer such
as the Indian one for $100. Since Wal-Mart is a global
operation, there is a strong incentive to do this. Wal-Mart
was the first major US retailer to offer PCs without Windows
preloaded. Already Walmart.com (Wal-Mart's e-commerce site)
offers a $498 Balance laptop that runs Linux-based Linspire
http://www.linspire.com/lindows_news_pressreleases_archives.
php?id=154 .

For desktops, Walmart.com offers a $398 desktop from Microtel,
with a 1 GHz Duron processor (includes disk drive but no
monitor). It runs a version of Linux from Sun Microsystems,
the famous maker of Java workstations and Java software. All
of these Wal-Mart prices do not even require mail-in rebates!
http://news.com.com/2100-7344-5182158.html

FOR THE WORLD: The fabled MIT Media Lab (Nicholas Negroponte)
is developing a $100 laptop now http://laptop.media.mit. This
will be worthwhile ONLY as long as it is based on Linux or
other open-source software rather than Microsoft.

Via Technologies, a chip-set maker in Taiwan, has designed the
Terra PC, which it will license worldwide and which will sell
for $250. It should be available in India and elsewhere in
autumn of 2005. It even includes a monitor in the $250 price.
http://news.com.com/Via+readies+250+PC/2100-1003_3-5701443.
html The Terra appears to not be infected by Windows or
Microsoft yet.

AVOID THE AMD PIC (PERSONAL INTERNET COMMUNICATOR): The US
chip maker AMD has designed the PIC to sell for $185. The
India version of this has not made a dent in the market,
fortunately. This will run on Windows CE and is another
Microsoft trap -- like "Starter Edition" XP, or Windows Lite -
- for entry-level users. Once MS has you, it's hard to break
loose. Generally, non-US hardware is safer for those wanting
to avoid Microsoft/Windows software. Any Via solution is
preferable to AMD. AMD's chairman, Hector Ruiz, is an advocate
of $100 computers, but he has sold out to Microsoft. See http:
//news.com.com/Why+100+computers+are+on+the+way/2008-1036_3-
5684006.html .

FOREIGNERS BEWARE! All of the American software and
electronics companies are sometimes friends and sometimes foes
of Microsoft. All American companies would like their own
sweetheart deals with Microsoft. Take, for example, Sun: http:
//news.com.com/Sun+and+Microsoft+Friend+and+foe/2009-1014_3-
5184266.html?tag=st.ref.goo

THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE

It is only a matter of time before the computer becomes a
commodity available at the nearest Wal-Mart store for $100 or
$200. I have a $7 twelve-band short-wave radio from China via
Odd Lots. A few years ago I would have had to pay almost $100
for a Grundig G-1000A to get as much functionality and quality
(and I have been at this for many years). I wouldn't have
believed it economically possible until I saw it and grabbed
it.

Could Microsoft stop Wal-Mart? No. Microsoft really is just a
windbag (puffing 10 times more features than you need for 10
times the price) and a moneybag (lots of cash -- and market
capitalization, based on hype and stock splits). If Wal-Mart
doesn't do it first, someone else will. http://www.walmart.com

THE INDIAN MOBILIS -- AT LAST A REAL COMPUTER

It comes from Encore Software Ltd. of Bangalore. http://www.
hindu.com/2005/05/11/stories/2005051103002200.htm It has a
small VGA (color-screen standard) LCD screen and rollup
keyboard, weighs about one and a half pounds (three-fourths of
a kilogram), and opens up to a desktop configuration. It has
flash memory (electronically erasable, programmable read-only
memory) instead of a hard drive.

The software is based on Linux and developments sponsored by
the government of India. Already it has the most-used
applications of a computer: word-processing, email, Web
browsing, and a spreadsheet. Nonproprietary software (by which
I define "general purpose") and all-electronic operation
provide, finally, a real, general-purpose, electronic computer
for home and office use. This appears to be safe from
Microsoft for now.

HORSEPOWER RACE/SCAM

Cheap nonvolatile semiconductor memory is making it possible
to put the OS on chips and eliminate the hard drive, as in the
Mobilis. Abandoning the hard drive involves avoiding bloated
monstrosities like Windows XP, which squanders at least 64 MB
of storage (128 MB is recommended) with bundled application
programs, some of which you probably haven't even noticed, and
with bells and whistles that are "helpful" like too many cooks
in the kitchen.

The game that MS and Intel have used to amass huge capital,
and power (but I repeat myself), is reminiscent of the Fifties
and Sixties "horsepower race" of American car companies
(foolishly reprised with SUVs, a 108-day supply of which is on
car lots now). Microsoft develops a new operating system that
works less than optimally on current computers. Then Intel
designs a new microprocessor with a higher level of
integration (a much greater density of circuit components) and
enough power to run the latest generation of Windows. A few
years later, MS raises the ante and we are in for another
round of computer replacements (those of you who fall for
this). The rest (non-MS part) of the software industry mainly
is engaged in making applications programs -- new programs for
work and entertainment -- that exploit the increased power of
the Intel and Windows hardware and software. Microsoft bundles
as much software with Windows as the traffic, or price, will
bear -- making Windows as expensive and problem-prone as they
can get away with. The result: Two thirds of the software on a
computer runs the other third.

Of course it can be either Intel or Microsoft that initiates
the next round of planned obsolescence in computer. HOWEVER --
and this is key -- the next stage, the next level of
integration, going from 0.09-micron wafer fab process to 0.
065, will cost Intel $6 billion, which only they and IBM can
afford. One of the reasons for the "tech wreck" in stocks
probably was the diminishing returns on higher levels of
circuit integration. Physical limits to processor circuit
density -- in tandem with the dumping of boatloads of
computers -- will end the horsepower race, but Intel and
Microsoft dominance will continue for a season.

OS HISTORY -- GROWING LIKE TOPSY

How ridiculous is this? Consider the amount of memory needed
to accommodate various operating systems. The following shows
how operating systems have grown (the MINIMUM amount of RAM
required by operating sytems). Most of the growth since
Microsoft got involved with MS-DOS version 1.0 has been the
result of the Microsoft-Intel horsepower race (between
themselves and computer buyers' gullibility). Basically this
list is in reverse chronological order (most recent first):

Windows XP ---------------------------- 64MB (minimum, 128 MB
recommended)
Linux Red Hat (Unix clone) -------- 32 MB
Apple Mac OS 8.6 -------------------- 24 MB
Windows 98 --------------------------- 24 MB
Windows 95 ----------------------------- 8 MB
Commodore Amiga OS 3.5 --------- 8 MB
Windows 3.11 --------------------------- 3 MB
Apple Lisa -------------------------------- 1 MB
MS-DOS 6.22 ------------------------- 512 KB
Windows CE (for Pocket PC) ----- 512 KB (in ROM)
Apple Mackintosh OS 1.0 ---------- 128 KB
CP/M --------------------------------------- 20 KB
MS-DOS 1.0 ----------------------------- 16 KB
TRS-DOS (Radio Shack) -------------- 4 KB

One hundred and twenty-four megabytes for the operating system
is "the dumbest fool thing I have ever heard!" (Bill Gates
rhetoric I cleaned up). The OS should fit on an inexpensive
amount of flash memory. Eliminating the hard drive gets rid of
a lot of cost, size, weight, and Windows to boot (no pun).

I wrote a book in the late 1970s (see list at end) that
included Tandy Leather Company's offering, the Tandy-Radio
Shack TRS-80. A few years before that, I remember programming
microcomputers, as we called them then, bit by bit -- this was
basically a microprocessor development system using machine
language. I remember my relief a year or so later when I could
build a Heathkit H8 and program it four bits at a time using a
hexadecimal keypad -- this was basically a microprocessor
development kit or demonstrator. I remember Don Lancaster's
"TV Typewriter" in the mid Seventies -- this was basically a
dumb terminal. It could be coupled to a time-sharing computer
system, but mostly it was used just for displaying 512
characters on a screen and for amateur experimentation
(chatting by text via ham radio, for example). Then, in the
late Seventies, with the TRS-80 and its contemporaries, which
melded CRT screen and keyboard, it was possible to program a
home computer in a higher level language at last, BASIC. At
the time, our dreams for computing didn't go much beyond
balancing a checkbook (I never heard of anyone actually doing
this with those relics). This was an era of open systems 25-
plus years ago: Many people designed operating systems for the
TRS-80.

While we were playing with these things and naming ourselves
"hackers" after model railroaders who hard-wired complex train
controls beneath their layout tables (no connotation of
malware back then), Doug Engelbart was fathering the mouse and
graphical user interface (he invented windows with a small
"w") at Xerox in Palo Alto. He, not Microsoft, invented the
windowed or paned interface. Theodor Nelson (the man who
coined the word "hypertext" as in http and html) was dreaming
of the useful and usable computers we still don't have -- and
of something like the Web and Marshall McLuhan's "everything
all at once." Nelson also dreamed of putting the corpus of
human knowledge on the equivalent of an e-commerce network
(which Google seems headed towards finally). We all were
dreaming of useful and usable computers for the masses -- and
we still don't have them, thanks to Microsoft, Intel, and
people of small technogical visions and large greed. At this
time (the Seventies) Bill Gates was dreaming of how to make
money with software while most others were counting on doing
it with hardware. He never lost his lead at this, but his
company never invented anything significant. The last time I
was thrilled by his company was when they came out with MS-
BASIC.

Bill Gates killed the dream.

THE DREAM BEGINS WHERE MICROSOFT ENDS

Progress toward the dream -- cheap, simple, real computers --
will begin again when the cultural imperative becomes global
and bigger than Microsoft. This will not be good for
Microsoft, but it will be for nearly everyone else. This is
about a kind of freedom for the people of the world. The time
is at hand.


MICROSOFT AGAINST THE WORLD

Microsoft's leading executive, CEO Steve Ballmer, is trotting
about the globe "warning nations about the potential for
patent lawsuits if they use Linux." This is sovereign nations
Ballmer (maybe we should add an "s" in his name) is
addressing. The sovereign State of Microsoft knows no limits
to its boldness, but Ballmer and Gates and company are
harboring an illusory hope if they think they can duplicate in
the world at large their US marketing windfall.

The Mobilis could become the MobilUS; and when it or some
other cheap, simple, real computer hits US shores, the emperor
of Microsoft will be exposed (financially, too) and we will be
on our way toward much, much more useful computers.

Hi,

I use a Dell latitude notebook running RH9. I have init 3 as runlevel.
After  login: prompt is displayed (few seconds later) I have a message
concatenated with the login prompt as shown below -

login: spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7

When I hit the enter key again it shows a clean login prompt and I'm
able to proceed as usual. Though I can operate normally irrespective
of this strange message in the beginning, thought I  should clarify
what it does mean. Any idea?

Thanks.

One Day One Command
===================

factor -- Print prime factors

Summary:

Print the prime factors of each number.The algorithm it uses is not
very sophisticated, so for some inputs `factor' runs for a long time.

Example:

$ factor 25 -- Print prime factors

$ factor 125 200 -- Print prime factors for each number.

$ factor `echo '2^64-1'|bc` -- Factors the largest 64-bit number.

$ factor `echo '4294967279 * 4294967291'|bc` -- Factors the largest
                 32-bit prime numbers. (Warning: It take more time)

Read: man factor

Subject: [Ilugc] BSNL connection timeouts
Message-ID: <429C26C9.8010308@email.com>

Summary: can't connect to BSNL broadband for the last four days.

Here's my configuration:

OS:         FC3 Linux, user space patched, stock kernel
PPPoE:      3.5-22
ADSL Modem: UTStar

This configuration was working fine with the Home-1000 plan until 4 days 
ago.  All of a sudden, it stopped connecting.  The WAN and LAN lights on 
the modem still light up.  But there is no connection.

The following log messages appear in /var/log/messages each time a 
connection is attempted:

May 29 14:04:44 localhost pppd[19569]: pppd 2.4.2 started by root, uid 0
May 29 14:04:44 localhost pppd[19569]: Using interface ppp0

May 29 14:05:19 localhost pppoe[19580]: Timeout waiting for PADO packets
May 29 14:05:19 localhost pppd[19569]: Exit.
May 29 14:05:19 localhost adsl-connect: ADSL connection lost; attempting 
re-connection.

May 29 14:05:56 localhost pppd[24155]: Connection terminated.
May 29 14:05:59 localhost pppoe[24156]: Timeout waiting for PADO packets
May 29 14:05:59 localhost pppd[24155]: Exit.

BSNL claims that their end of the configuration is ok and the problem 
must be at my end.  They claim ignorance of Linux.  I did not make any 
configuration changes or applied any patches when the problem started.

Not sure what I should do now.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

This may happen due to two reasons

1. PADI packet (First pkt sent by pppoe client) not reaching 
the pppoe server (at BSNL end).

2. The response for the PADI (i.e., PADO pkt) not reaching 
your PC.

So, Check Your Ethernet Cable.

Lucky you. 

I was not able to connect to BSNL for the past 10
days. The telephone line was ok, but, the WAN and
PPPOE port didn't blink at all. Thought it was a
problem with the exchange. I guess its somewhat fixed
now. Been calling 16004241600 daily.

Now I still get :

/usr/sbin/adsl-start: line 194: 3952 Terminated
$CONNECT "$@" > /dev/null 2>&1

but, I do get an IP address and I am able to browse
the Internet! Strange, but, true :)

Regards,

SK

Hello folks!
Live streaming video of the 6th Gnome Developers
Conference, Stuttgart Germany, in the OGG format is
available from this site:

You can use http://videolan.org for downloading a
GPL[Free] player, or mplayer anything.

Miguel's talk on GNOME future & MONO,
BBC people on Dirac Codec are cool.

Im waiting for the rest to float through my pipe,
at 25Kbps.

Cheers
Muthu.
