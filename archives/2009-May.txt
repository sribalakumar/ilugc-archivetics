The db.lan zone file looks OK, although I prefer to use a A record for 
the "ns" "mx" hosts rather than CNAME.  I have not seen a CNAME record 
with a wild card hostname such as "*.pan?CNAME?pan" but if it works 
great.

I would suggest you search through the avahi mailing lists and/or hang 
out there, I am sure the authors and guru level users hang out there 
and get more competent help there.

Subject: [Ilugc] Moving postgreSQL <path>/data folder between systems
Message-ID: <200905012309.21410.knura@yahoo.com>

[1] AMD64 system  (dead/RIP)
OS: openSUSE 11.1 (x86_64)
PG: 8.3

[2] Intel Pentium IV (working system)
OS: openSUSE 11.1 (x86)
PG: 8.3

I had a couple of applications using PostgreSQL backend on an AMD64 
based system.  Unfortunately, the motherboard decided to RIP; so it is 
not  possible of getting a db dump.   The hard disk is fine though.  

I migrated the hard disk from [1] to [2], copied /var/lib/pgsql/data 
from [1] to /var/lib/pgsql/data on [2].  I ensured that postgresql was 
stopped during the process.  After copying the data files, postgresql 
fails to start.  I have checked that file ownership and permissions are 
the same between a running postgresql and the above setup.

The following links (from Google search) suggest that above procedure 
should work.

<http://archives.postgresql.org//pgsql-admin/2007-05/msg00097.php>

Any suggestions/pointers as what may be wrong with what I am trying to 
do.

Updates:

While trying to recover, I had another idea, if you remember, I theorised that "Simple backup and restore" created a directory in /media.
Following up on that theory, I used testdisk to go to /media/KC in the old partition of my laptop harddisk and lo behold, the directory did exist and all my backups (almost 15 of them - I am a paranoid backer upper) were safely in that directory. 
!!! WIN !!!
I recovered all my incremental backup files. I had my original full backup and hence have all my data back.

BTW, Ubuntu puts the underscore *after* the name. Since /media/KC" was created by "Simple backup", Ubuntu created the directory "/media/KC_"
and not "/media/_KC" (i.e. the underscore is *after* "KC" and not before) as I wrongly reported in my earlier email.


Moral of the story:
1. Take regular backups on external media like DVDs and keep testing restores once a month or so.
2. Keep thanking the selfless souls who write great software and release it under GPL
3. Make contributions to projects which save your life - either code, bug reports, testing, documentation or cash (I am donating $$ to testdisk!!)

With this exercise, I have become pretty experienced in data recovery -
I recovered a mysql DB after a bug dropped all tables in the DB in the
production server. It was a new server and we still hadn't started
automated backups on it. It is possible to recover the DB from just the
ibdata files provided you have the schema and have some idea of the
text content of the tables. 

I would also recommend Jaunty - Ubuntu 9.04 to all. It really is very good. Though I have been a lifelong RH/Fedora fan and use Fedora/CentOs on servers as well as my laptop, I started dual booting (actually quadraple booting - Fedora, Ubuntu, Suse and ...) Ubuntu since 7.10. With 9.04 I think I have migrated completely to Ubuntu on my laptop. I erased Fedora 10. I am very used to Fedora/Cent on servers mainly because I have been using it since 1999 and know it well - .profiles, .rc, service controls, init.d.....but for everyday office use - documents, scans, productivity...Ubuntu is really up there. In terms of usability for non-geeks, I think Ubuntu has finally beaten Windows. The usability is fantastic and desktop effects work without binary drivers. It is very close to Mac and should beat it too pretty soon.

Thanks to all for reading my loooong emails and for pitching in with suggestions.

Are you referring to the ones in the /var/lib/pgsql/data directory?  
Nothing there.

When I do /etc/init.d/postgresql start the only indication I get 
is "failed" message on the terminal.

No, not the DB transaction logs.

I'm referring to /var/log/postgresql.log or syslog or wherever
your log_destination is set to in postgresql.conf.

Dear Bharathi,

I had a thought in my mind, just sharing with you the same. i had a plan
which i wrote it below. Please do suggest me how could we, make it work.  I
am looking forward for our suggestions and comments.


I had a plan to conduct one day free LAMP (PHP) session,  for the freshmen
on behalf of ILIGC.

The details regarding to the workshop was mentioned below.

Topic:  *Bits and  Pieces of the Web Apps, using LAMP (PHP) stack. *
Target Audience:*  Beginners to Intermediate*, Anybody who possess the
curiosity to explore the new esteem.
Place: (Yet to be decided ),  We need somebody to host the workshop by
providing their facility. [1]
Date: [2]
Guarantee: The participants would be learning the *core concept of the web
application  development* by end of the session.
Location: *Chennai.**

*If you think, its impressive I like to share the training content. Am
looking forward for your earlier reply.


[1]  Its purely an non commercial activity, so that I am unable to bear any
cost for the facility been used for the training.

[2] Date would be decided based on the availability of the facility.

In openSUSE11.1 the server logs are in /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_log/*

I am testing the migrated data by providing a link file "data" pointing 
to either the bare db created by initdb during install (data.install) 
or the data.amd64 dir migrated from the old machine.

When "data" is linked to data.install, pg starts and the logfiles are in 
data/pg_log.

When "data" is pointing to data.amd64 then pg start hangs for ~ 2 mins 
and then displays "failed" there is no log file in data/pg_log

Please see session transcript below

Good initiative but I don't understand why non-commercial and why not
Commercial , why not team up with local training institutes or NRCFOSS
? make the content open on places like  NRCFOSS website or
http://en.wikiversity.org , decide how  you want to go about FREE (
Freedom ) vs free (price) or you are doing this one free course to
know market dynamics as in demand ?

In your case, the pg_ctl start command is failing. You should modify
the init.d script to log the output of this command somewhere instead
of /dev/null. You should add a line similar to the one following:

        su - $PGUSER -c "$DAEMON -D '$PGDATA' &" >>/var/log/pgsql.log 2>&1

You did not specify, but sounds like the source machine is a 64 bit
one and destination is a 32 bit machine? If yes, i'm not sure if it is
going to work this way. AFAIK, the data directory may be different for
different architectures. You should dig deep to find out what's
holding you back.

If that does not help, you may look out for options to migrate the
data directory from AMD -> INTEL. If that does not help, you may also
check if there's a tool to generate sql commands out of data
directory. If yes, you can use the tool to create the sql dump file
and restore it into the new data directory.

Good luck!

Speaking of release versions, mysql might have the most warped release 
numbering strategy. Like mysqlcluster 6 has nothing to do with mysql 6 
and mysql 5.2 might have no commit train into 5.3 !

Message-ID: <e6b5008a0905032044o713fac00x630624d5fc439ea1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm having a problem with the Intel PRO/Wireless 2200 card's driver on
Debian Lenny..

An "lspci | grep -i wireless" or "lscpi | grep -i 2200" does not
uotput anything devices though Arch and Ubuntu display my wireless
device..
I installed the firmware-ipw2x00 package and did a "modprobe ipw2200"..
I Rebooted and then found that the .fw files were present in the
/lib/firmware directory..
But a "dmesg | grep -i ipw2200" gave me nothing..

Then, i read http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/debian-linux-help/80014-intel-wireless-problems.html,
i removed all ipw files from /lib/firmware, downloaded the latest
files (ipw2200 v3.1) from http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net and manually
copied all the files in the tarball to /lib/firmware and again did a
"modprobe ipw2200". Another reboot and still, my wireless isn't
working..

"ifconfig" outputs only two interfacces.. lo and eth0. No sign of
anything even remotely like wlan0. "iwconfig" says there are no
wireless extensions for both lo and eth0.
A ls -l /lib/firmware gives the following output:

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 191154 2009-05-02 17:40 ipw2200-bss.fw
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 185428 2009-05-02 17:40 ipw2200-ibss.fw
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 187836 2009-05-02 17:40 ipw2200-sniffer.fw
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root ?12007 2009-05-02 17:40 LICENSE.ipw2200-fw

The gnome network manager also doesn't show any wireless networks. in
ubuntu, I used to see two checkboxes "Enable Wired" and "Enable
Wireless Networks".. But here, i don't see any reference to wireless
networks at all..

Anything I can do to solve this and make Debian detect my wireless card?



May the source be with you.

I hope you didn't reboot after doing the modprobe, since that may undo
the modprobe... But assuming that the module is loaded every reboot,
the problem would be there...

I would suggest comparing the lspci output on your computer with the
ones given at the bottom of the page:

http://wiki.debian.org/ipw2200

There are also a couple of troubleshooting tips on that page, which
might help. It would be nice if you could describe part of the dmesg
output which appears when you insert the module using modprobe, since
that could help track down where the problem might be.

Are you booting using a Debian linux-image-2.6.26-2-... kernel?
If so you may want to should run (as root).
 update-initramfs -u
This ensures that all needed modules are in the initrd.img image.

Other than that your problem appears to be mysterious since the
ipw2200 driver works fine with the R51 that we have.

Hi,

I addressed the following topics for a Free Software workshop at NBKR
Institute of Science and Technology, Vidyanagar, Nellore district,
Andhra Pradesh, India on Saturday, May 2, 2009:
* Career opportunities with Free Software
* i-want-2-do-project. tell-me-wat-2-fedora.
 * Mailing list guidelines
 * Communication guidelines
 * Fedora sub-projects
* Embedded Systems concepts

I would like to thank Rajesh Sola, Lecturer, for organizing the
workshop, and for coordinating with me for the past couple of months
for this workshop.

The CS labs have Fedora installed. I have given them Fedora 10 DVDs
and stickers (thanks to Rahul Sundaram) which they can distribute to
other engineering departments.

Pointers to Fedora mailing lists, IRCs have been given to the students.

Vidyanagar is around 140 km from Chennai. The National Highway 5
(NH-5) is quite good. By road, it will be a 2-hour drive. The closest
railway station is Gudur station, and the Institute is around 25 km
from the station.

The lab facilities are quite good, and the students were quite
enthusiastic during the workshop. It would be good to do a one or
two-day unconference, if possible, at the Institute as it will cater
to nearby Nellore, Kota, Tirupathi, Vakadu, and Gudur regions. It is
possible to go a one-day workshop and return the same day to Chennai,
or, the guest house facilities are equally good if overnight stay is
required.

Some photos taken during this trip and at the venue are available at:

lspci does not output a wireless device at all even after installing
the firmware / manually placing it in /lib/firmware and adding it to
the boot image..

I don't understand this part.. You want me to paste the dmesg output
as a whole (that'd be too long)? Or should i pipe grep -i <something>
and display the output?

I'm booting using a Debian linux-image-2.6.26-1-... kernel.. I forgot
to mention updating the image.. I'd done it once i added the ipw2200
module to the kernel using modprobe..

ILUGC, does a lot of activities (training, Workshops, LDD, Seminars) in
promoting F/OSS to the public, as I am being a part of ILUGC, I expecting
this workshop to be an FOSS proportional activity, in creating awareness in
LAMP stack.

Yes I am interested, If they are ready to host the workshop as FOSS
promotional activity in collaboration with ILUGC,  I really don't have an
issue in working with them.

When it comes to  NRCFOSS, I would be very happy, if they provide us enough
facility to host the show.  I request Mr. CNK  & KG to consider this on
behalf of NRCFOSS.

Planned to do that.

FREE , absolutely yes in both cases.

My interest is not do the market research, Since of the scope of the
technology is known to every body. I don't want to reinvent the wheel again.


I also don't want to end up with this single workshop, since i have series
of plan to take it for the long run. I received 10 to 12 enquiries regarding
the date and venue of the session.

Regarding date and venue is not finalized, since we are looking for somebody
to host the session.  Once it been fixed i would be sharing the details with
the list.

Thanks for your Support. [1].

[1]  Today morning somebody form the Arunai Engg,. College enquired
regarding the  workshop.

lspci output does not depend on module presence. With or without the
module, lspci would display the same thing. For example, in mine, I
have this:

0b:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan] Network Connection (rev 02)

What does yours say?

No, just after the modprobe, do dmesg|less and scroll to the end, If
you see any output related to ipw2200, please paste the relevant lines
here.

So, how do you know it is an Intel Pro/Wireless card that you have?
Can you mention your system/hardware specification?

Subject: [Ilugc] [JOB] Project on FOSS adoption in Indian education
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0905050347460.1090-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

Mail from Dr Prabhu (Ex. Co-ordinator of ILUGC and Prof in IITB)

Project positions are open at IIT Bombay for a new government funded
project on adoption of Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) in Indian
science and engineering education.  Applicants may email their resumes
along with a one page writeup on why they think they are well suited
for the project to:  admin.foss[at]iitb.ac.in

News, announcements and details regarding the project are available
here: http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/~prabhu/Projects/FOSSEducation

Overview of the project
-----------------------

The eventual goal is to replace the use of commercial tools in Indian
science and engineering education at the college level.  Towards this
we are working on the following broad themes:

 - Python for scientific computing.
 - Scilab (http://www.scilab.org, http://www.scilab.in).
 - Multimedia authoring tool suited for Indian languages with a LaTeX
   backend.
 - Other projects related to the above.

I will be personally involved with the "Python for scientific
computing" component.  This will broadly involve:

 - NumPy (http://numpy.scipy.org),
 - SciPy (http://www.scipy.org),
 - matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sf.net),
 - Sage (http://www.sagemath.org),
 - Mayavi (http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi),
 - ETS (http://code.enthought.com/projects),
 - SymPy (http://code.google.com/p/sympy),

and various other packages of interest.

As part of the project you will have opportunity to work with the core
developers of these major projects.

Requirements
------------

The positions are all for a maximum duration of 3 years.  The initial
appointment will be for a period of 1 year which will be extended
based on performance.

 - Project manager:  1 position
 - Technical writer: 1 position
 - Software Developers/content generators:
   - Python: 4 positions
   - Scilab: 3 positions
   - LaTeX:  2 positions

You will need to stay on campus or commute to IITB.  Accommodation
will be provided if available, otherwise HRA will be provided.

Qualifications
---------------

Project manager:
 - Good knowledge of programming and open source software community

 - Good math and science skills

System administration and web development skills are also required so
strong applications with those skills would also be considered.
Experience with Python/Scilab/LaTeX is a plus. Experience with
working on a FOSS project is a big plus.

Job description
---------------

As part of this project you will work towards creating material for
adoption of the various existing FOSS tools in the science and
engineering curriculum.  This will involve generation of a significant
amount of documentation in the form of tutorials, audio/video
demonstrations, written material, and lectures.  The material will
often go towards augmenting existing courses.  The project will
involve working with several well known packages and improving them
both in terms of documentation and code to add features or fix bugs.

We will be hosting several workshops, sprints and conferences where
you will get to meet the developers of many important packages.

Remuneration
-------------

The pay will be in the range Rs. 10000 to 30000 depending on the
qualifications and experience. For extra-ordinary people the upper
limit is flexible. Accommodation will be provided on campus if
available.

Why you should apply
--------------------

 - You get paid to improve and write FOSS.

Hi Everyone,

I am planning to setup a Infrastructure with 15-20 Computers, Router,
Internet and Complete Network. I wish to promote this Infrastructure to be
used by anyone from ILUGC to conduct Workshops at very reasonable fee
structure something like Rs. 500 per participant for 2 Days. Anyone
interested in conducting workshop can use this facility for the said price
and may be can charge extra from the participants for the workshop. The said
charge would be all inclusive, including electricity, rent, use of
computers, internet, etc.

I shall provide complete library of all flavours and versions of Linux that
can be used for the workshop. Apart from Linux, it will also have other
useful applications and OSS usually not found in Distros like Vyatta,
Asterisk, vTiger, SugarCRM, Tiny ERP, Bravo, Callweaver, Mono, etc. Anything
named will be provided(downloaded) in the library.

I conceived this Idea after going through the Digest that someone wanted to
conduct Workshop on LAMP but was not sure about the place to conduct it.

Do you people think that this Idea will work out ?????

Hi !

I would like to extend this idea to a virtualised setup where anyone can log
in to their virtual linux boxes from anywhere.
I have a server and anyone can try out the virtual desktop. Few Ilugc
members have tried out the virtual desktop and found it very responsive and
usable even for reasonably low badwidths. If anyone wants a test run then I
can set up account for them.

Cheers

i think he is trying to solve issue of administrative or logistical in
nature ,  what you encounter while getting access to a lab or
classroom in short term.

it can also be used for Coworking  http://wiki.coworking.info/FrontPage

@Shakti asked in the mail about fixed as well as variable cost , i
think the models will evolve over time depending on the demand for
such a facility , like service offerings on A la carte basis.

there must be lots of spaces for people who can afford but not many at
the rate which you mentioned we can call these spaces FOSSLand :-)

Squid has native ACL capability using which you can
pass/block websites.  However, this is a little difficult to
work with, using an external plugin is recommended.

Try squidguard.org.  It's readily available in most distros
and there's plenty of online docs to get you started.

You can also try dansguardian.org which includes
many more features beyond squid guard.

Evoultion in 9.04 supports .pst ......

......In other words, Evolution is now a complete and total Linux
replacement for Outlook. If the only reason you've stuck with Windows is
because of Outlook, you don't have to stick with it anymore.....

To the best of my knowledge there are no tools to extract data out of 
the proprietary .pst format into open standards format.

Your best bet:
Using Outlook, connect to an IMAP server and transfer your messages 
from "local" to the IMAP server.  Once this is complete then use 
Thunderbird to connect to the IMAP server and copy the messages to the 
Thunderbird's "local" folders.

Hi ,

There is a thunderbird pst import pluggin. It works in importing .pst files
into thunderbird . But attimes it does not render HTML mails properly. I
have seen people complaining that the HTML tags are not rendered , and it is
available as a plain text message with the HTML tags .

I've seen people use perl on Windows to call a MAPI layer and extract 
emails to playback into a mbox format. There might even be examples of 
that kind of a thing around somewhere.

I believe thunderbird in windows can take your outlook mails. Once you have
thunderbird in windows, it is just copying thunderbird forlder to GNU/Linux.

Is the kernel module class that was cancelled scheduled to be reheld
sometime later? I
had a problem with my ethernet card too. I couldn't make it to the
classes. I read up the logs
though.

Message-ID: <634797.25054.qm@web33107.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I searched to see if I have any old acl lists but couldn't find them. I did this a long time back but remember enough to give you a start.
For the actual syntax, there are a *lot* of articles on the net.

1. You will have to define groups of computers(IP addresses) or users(people). 1.1 Lets look at IP addresses:
1.1.1 You can have lists of individual IP addresses: Eg. developers=192.168.0.2, 192.168.0.4, 192.168.0.5, ......
test_engineers=192.168.0.3, 192.168.0.6, ......
1.1.2 You can have a group defined as a net mask:
developers=192.168.0.0/255
test_engineers=192.168.1.0/255

2. You can create groups of URLs, whitelists and blacklists....
Eg: blacklist1=*facebook.com, *myspace.com, *exe....
blacklist2=*flickr.com, *picasa*, *zip....
whitelist1=sourceforge.net, rubyforge.net
whitelist2=google.com, rediff.com
You can have these as external text files. Also accepts regex....
You can restrict downloads too using this process - notice the *exe above.
A group can consist of single IP too. A single IP can be in multiple groups but try to avoid that as it leads to confusion on what is allowed and what is denied.

3. Finally define which group can access which list. (acl = access control list)
3.1 For a tightly restrictive system, first DENY everything to everybody and then allow access to individual whitelistslists/sites to individual groups.
3.2 For loose system, ALLOW everything to everybody and then DENY individual balcklists/sites to individual groups.
3.3 Make sure that you set relatively loose permissions to CEO and top mgmt.

4 MOST IMPORTANT: Make sure you communicate well with all people in the firm.
4.1 First send out an email that you are introducing usage policies and that they will be some teething problems and that they will be streamlined over time. Tell your users that they may initially face issues in accessing regular sites too as the rules are not fully tested. Ask them to send emails with requests - this will reduce a lot of friction during the initial phases and you will also have a list so that you will not forget.
4.2 Start with a small group, stabilise it, then move on to bigger groups - do not try a big bang approach. You will face a lot of problems with a big-bang approach.
4.3 Finally remember that you are trying to reduce wastage and bandwidth usage to enhance productivity - be responsive to allowing productivity sites like technical help...be proactive about helping them be more productive.

5. You can also ask squid to use your Directory Server so that you monitor based on user rather than IP address. That is slightly advanced and you can try it later.

Thanks,
kc

Hi Balaviswanathan,

You can use Dans Guardian or Squidguard for your purpose. Just google,
you'll get complete documentation for the implementation.

Hi Everyone again....

SK - I've really not decided on the exact quote, the figure given earlier
was for assumption. I'll require all your suggestion to come to a reasonable
quote tagging. How much do you think should be OK ???

Vardharajan - You idea is really good, but it is completely different from
what I'm projecting. My idea is for providing Infrastructure for Workshops
and Classes whereas your idea is for Individuals.

Satya - Rightly said, more can be figured out only after the concept evolves
further based on requirement.

From,

Given the following address record:

chef.tech-recipes.com. IN A 192.168.5.100

To add host aliases ftp and www pointing to chef, use the following
resource records:

ftp.tech-recipes.com. IN CNAME chef.tech-recipes.com.
www.tech-recipes.com. IN CNAME chef.tech-recipes.com.

Within the same domain name which is the same domain associated with
the zone file, these can be shortened to:

chef IN A 192.168.5.100
ftp IN CNAME chef
www IN CNAME chef

I don't really know what Windows Live Writer provides as features
(and, it would help if you pointed to some URL/text about it), but how
about <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1730> ?

Try openvpn.  The openvpn server is to be installed on a Linux box in
your office, and there are clients available for several platforms like
Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.

OpenVPN is SSL based and does not suffer from NAT and firewall
port forwarding issues.

openvpn.net has a lot of documentation to get you started.  There
are also plenty of tutorials/guides online which can walk you through
the process.  Post back if you require any specific help.

I have no clue what features Windows Live Writer has but Drivel is worth
trying, and if you eventually would like to move to something less
featured, you can look at the gnome-blog panel applet. Drivel is quite
easy to use, really, though I had some trouble with it and Wordpress
some time back. It claims support for Blogger, though.

The point of doing it in a regular schedule is to allow others to plan

Escape the space in the name
/home/ss4u/smb4k/PRODUCTION/kannan/new\ file


Better still, use an underscore or camelCase

eg. new_file or newFile

Scribefire works nicely with wordpress, but if I use it with my
serendipity blog, the output is horrendous. I prefer drivel to work
with serendipity. So, I guess it's important to know what blogging
engine is being used.

> But dont know what is offline blog publishing?

Type your post without needing to go online. Or typing it on your
desktop application, even if you're online, and then publishing it
online once finished.

Folks,

can expand into later. We've formed a Founding Board of Directors
(myself, Jeff, Kitt, Melissa, and Brian Klug) and are in the process
of opening our bank account. We even have over $10k of checks in hand
for Hacker Dojo, mostly from this initial Board.

But here's where you come in - we'd like to seed the Dojo with some
awesome DevHouse hackers. Memberships at the Dojo (which entitle you
to drop-in privileges and the ability to bring guests) start at $100/
mo. If you'd like to be a Founding Member, just prepay three months of
membership by the end of the month, or sign up for a monthly PayPal
subscription. More details are at http://d0j0.com/JoinTheDojo - sign
up now! If you can spare more than this and want to support the cause,
please donate more to sponsor memberships. (I myself just put in $2000
of my own money tonight; Kitt put in $3000, and Brian Klug wrote a
check to Hacker Dojo for a whopping $6000.)

Either way, I'd like to strongly encourage all DevHousers to to join
the Hacker Dojo PBworks space at d0j0.com and the mailing list at
groups.google.com/group/hackerdojo to get involved with this
community. Hacker Dojo will likely be the "operating organization"
that actually runs DevHouse, so these two Bay Area hacker brands are
going to be like peas in a pod. And if you've ever thought to yourself
"gosh, I'd like to have a hackathon of my own and I'd run it like..."
or "I wish I had a space to run a class/event for..." then dust off
those thinking caps, because our intent is to have the Dojo open for
innovation in June, provided enough folks like you join as members!

Cheers,
 David & The Dojo Gang

selenium for web (why did you walk out half way through the talk?). For 
desktop python has its own unittest module. In OSS programming, we usually 
build our tests as we code rather than finishing the coding and handing it over 
to some third party to test.

For desktop and stand alone applications, you can use python unittest
library. It is apt for automating the functional test cases. You may
write your own test suites with/without using unittest. See Subversion
command line test suites for details. It is completely written in
python. Refer to the README file for more details.
  http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/subversion/tests/cmdline/

OTOH, to test web applications I'm not sure why you want to stick with
python. There are so many other cool tools like webtest/selenium to
perform automated testing for web applications. Webtest for that
matter can be extended further using groovy scripting language. If i
recollect right, it also got perl and python extensions, please check
out.

Ok, that shouldn't make your svn access slow. I don't get this part -
"dont know viewvc client people using tortoise svn", can you please
elaborate, what you mean by that?

Many of us say that these things don't work in India .
Couple of months back, the Faridabad Municipal Corporation laid new
roads in his area and the residents were very happy about it. But 2
weeks later, BSNL dug up the newly laid roads to install new cables
which annoyed all the residents.. A resident used the above listed
grievance forum to highlight his concern.. To his surprise, BSNL and
Municipal Corporation of Faridabad were served a show cause notice and
the guy received a copy of the notice in one week. Government has
asked the MC and BSNL about the goof up as it's clear that both the
government departments were not in sync at all.

So use this grievance forum and educate others who don't know about
this facility.
This way we can at least raise our concerns instead of just talking
about the 'System' in India .

Invite your friends to contribute for many such happenings.

PLEASE SPREAD THIS MESSAGE IF U WANT OUR INDIA TO HAVE A BETTER
TOMORROW & FORWARD THIS MAIL TO AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.

Please stick to mailing list guidelines and don't forward
chain mail to a mailing list.



That website looks like it was made by a trainee using
MS Word.  Eye sore!!

When will our govt and public sector put out professional
websites?

You can setup Hybrid IRC server on your LAN:

To my knowledge xmpp protocol is more advanced than irc (gtalk is on
xmpp). The below URL provides some info on the same.

http://xmpp.org/software/clients.shtml

I have heard jabber is one good tool written in xmpp. Hope this helps.

I own a compaq cq40 317tu laptop.

After installing ubuntu 9.04, I see that there is no sound output in my
system.

I configured ALSA mixer and all other sound settings seems to be fine.

Please do help me to sort out the problem.

Thank you

How about this?

PC1:(192.168.1.4)
- -----------------

$ nc -l -p 3500

PC2: (192.168.1.5)
- ------------------

$ nc 192.168.1.4 3500
Hi how are you

PC1 will listen on port 3500 and PC2 will connect to PC1's 3500 port.
This chat will be like old unix's 'write' command chat.

I hope you will try atleast one time to see 'nc' magic.

PS: Guys, A kind request, Don't top post.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <4A037160.9020908@fedoraproject.org>

Hi,

If you are a Fedora user, read on. Otherwise, feel free to skip this
mail. I am doing a quick survey for software that you use on a regular
basis that is not available via the Fedora repository. Software that you
suggest should be free and open source, free of patent and other legal
issues (ie) don't suggest Adobe Flash Player or MP3 codecs.

Tell me the home page of the software and give me a brief description on
what it does.  Bonus points if you can see in Google for "software-name
fedora package review" to figure it if it is already in the Fedora
package review queue. If you know of RPM packages in other distributions
for the software your are suggesting, that information is useful as well.

Thanks.

Rahul

At this point, may as well fall back to ytalk, email with uucp and blog

I agree 100%. Many of the fortune companies, now demand Selenium for
their web-application - automation testing.

I agree and also beg to partially disagree. We write Unit test suites
(JUnit was one of the  first one to come up with the idea). They are
really great and save us a lot of time in identifying bugs caused in
development of applications that span more than one week (pun
intended). It also brings out and help identify problems associated
with some one else changing our code.

But Unit tests are just unit test. They don't fully address
functionality. You can write a unit test to verify if a configuration
file is read correctly. But a manual/ a third person (second eye) is
mandatory to certify that the application works as it should work. We
call this as "System testing".

Even for web-applications we can write unit-tests for the back-end
functionality  (say the database access layer, provided your
architecture is neatly layered). But you will still need a 3rd person
manual tester/ something like Selenium to verify that the application
works as expected.

In the corporate world, an application tested by the developer alone
is rarely accepted for general use.

with regards,
Natarajan.

I installed Kubuntu 9.04 on my HP laptop and faced the same problem. A
little googling, i found this.

1. Run ALSAMIXER from command prompt and you will find that the master
volume is MUTED !
2.   https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/326896
<quote>
and the way i made it work was adding this to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
options snd slots=snd-hda-intel
options snd-hda-intel enable_msi=1 model=hp-m4
alias snd-card-0 snd-hda-intel
</quote>

I did both. and now its working fine for me.

PS:  I have got KUBUNTU 9.04 DVD with me. If any one wants a copy,
please reachout to me. But, I don't think I will be able to come to
the meet on Saturday as its a working day for us.

1. Install Thunderbird on Windows and on startup import the pst files 
from Outlook
2. Copy the mailboxes from windows to Linux 
(%APPDATA%/thunderbird/mailbox_folder or (export from thunderbird into 
like mbox format and import in Linux)
3. Edit ~/.thunderbird/profiles.ini to point to the new folder

Not all the things are working in this. I have filed a grievance on 30th Jan
and they are supposed to resolve this in 90 days (clause 7.7), but till now
nothing moved.

This is one of ILUGC's members own experience.

Hi !

Netbook by definition is for basic tasks like browsing ,e-mail and
net-centric functions. If you want cd/dvd  and also a huge HD the  you
should go for regular notebooks. Netbook is not notebook.

And Notebooks with small screen sizes like 12' have always been priceier.

There is nothing to be sad about netbooks and in fact you should be happy
that netbooks put MS is a fix and gave exposure to Linux and open source .

And soon Netbooks will be based on ARM processors and Android operating
systems which will make them  nothing but a glorified cell phone !

Cheers

Just my 2c worth... I've had as my portable a HP TC4400 for about 2years 
and a bit. It came with an external USB dvd-rw drive that I've never 
used. Its still in its packing.

My 'other' Laptop, mostly to do r&d and play around with, reinstall 
things often and use as a demo machine is an Acer Ferrari 4005, its been 
with me about 3 years and a bit. It came with a built in dvdrw, After 2 
months of having the laptop, I removed it and replaced it with a similar 
red coloured blank. It worked out to roughly about 8% longer battery 
life ( even though I never used it, it was still consuming power ). I've 
never got around to replacing that drive back into the machine.

So, what do you think you will miss the optical media interface for on a 
portable ?

Most of the packages in Fedora are maintained by community volunteers.
The usual reason for any software missing is that nobody has volunteered
to do so.

courier-authlib, I see a dead review in

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=208064

courier-imap, IIRC was in Fedora sometime back and then got orphaned
later but I haven't verified now.

If you want to be a package maintainer yourself, refer to

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join_the_package_collection_maintainers

You can build for both Fedora and RHEL (via the EPEL repo)

Drop me a mail offlist if you need further help.

As far as I know none of these come with GNU/Linux pre-installed and
so it is a bit sad to see that you have narrowed down to these!

I find it tough too. I hate this Vista Only choice that many of the
laptops below
offer too. I guess I can say "NO OS" and get a 2K-3K rebate... FreeDOS is what
they may install :P

Actually, the situation has changed quite a bit. My budget went up by 10K :D
(Thanks Mom!)

My current choices are
1) Lenovo Thinkpad Y450 - 418398U
2) HP Pavillion DV2
3) HP Pavillion DV4tse
4) Dell Studio15 <- Does this have a huge touchpad problem. A friend
of mine said if that has been resolved, this is the best
5) HP Probook 4510s
6) Acer Aspire 6930

Hi Rahul,

nice initiative ,
below is a package I have not found in the repository, I am not sure
whether it is affected by the patent problems, please let me know if
it does.
-->  "eucalyptus"(http://open.eucalyptus.com/), which is used for
building elastic clouds over clusters. I guess it is already available
with the ubuntu package repository, but not sure of any rpms from
other distros.
Also, it is not a very commonly used software, but is of great
importance to some power users, but anyway I feel it would be a good
addition.

Cheers
Satish

Interesting concept! You should bring in dependencies like paneer,
spices etc to make it a more authentic analogy. Library like
preparation of the garam masala could be added too!

There is also a Debian source package "hello-debhelper" if you are
packaging .deb's for the first time.

 http://packages.debian.org/lenny/hello-debhelper

The "/proc/acpi/battery/" interface to battery information is
deprecated. Your program should also support the newer
"/sys/class/power_supply/" interface.

Till what you have mentioned should be fine. This should be good for a
hands-on workshop, say, for a couple of hours where people can get the
hands-on experience.

I also don't want to push the analogy too far. I believe, newbies
should be able to switch to software packages after this.

I do not understand the question. To localise any application, you have to 
mark the strings for translation, collect the strings into a .pot file using 
gettext, translate the strings using something like kbabel and then compile 
the .mo file. AFAIK the first step has to be done manually and usually it is 
best practice to do so when coding the application itself. Or maybe I have not 
understood what you want.

Dear All,

 

I'm developing a custom USB driver. There was an exception/crash when

For revision 21:

Much better than what it used to be. Some thoughts:

* README paragraphs can be aligned to fit within 80 columns. In Emacs,
you can go to the line and do, Alt-q.

* You updated your code to now use getopt, which is the way it should be done.

* You have initialized your global pointers, but, not your local
variables or local pointers.

* You could move your struct definitions to header files.

* Please check function return values. fopen(), for example.

* Run a spell-check on your comments.

* Appreciate if you could have some consistency in the spacing whether
or not you need spacing on either side of the operator:

 376:  for (i = 0;i <= total_string_len;i++)

* "char chuma" == :)

* In configure.ac, SRCDIR should be:
  AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR([src/webattery.c])

* You have used five header files, but, only check for presence of two
headers in AC_CHECK_HEADERS. You can include all five of them.
  AC_CHECK_HEADERS([stdlib.h string.h stdio.h getopt.h dirent.h])

The same applies to AC_CHECK_FUNCS. Remember, the more the
function/library checks you do now, the better will be the portability
checks, in case you decide to try it on some other system.

I suggest you read through this:
http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/books/autotools_a_guide_to_autoconf_automake_libtool

* Put a Changelog, AUTHORS file.

Configure your apache server to authenticate the users as described
here - http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn-book.html#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authn,
If you want authorization too, then see this -
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn-book.html#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz

This may be due to various reasons, which cannot be predicted without
bisecting the environment. (For example, network related slowness).

You are free to do that.

Depends upon the load. If svn users are more and the access is too
high then a dedicated machine should be best, if the load is less,
then you can run both svn and proxy in the same machine. A system
administrator should be the best judge in order to come up with a
solution for this, based upon the server usage in the specific
environment.

Serial console can be monitored for messages in the Linux kernel too....just
make sure that the appropriate kernel parameters are set.
Use a null-modem serial cable connected back-to-back across the serial ports
of your PC. Edit the kernel command line parameters in /boot/grub/menu.lst
(in Fedora) to append "console=ttyS0,115200" (other baud rates are possible
too), and remove the "quiet" line in the parameter. Ensure the same is
repeated on the PC at the other end. Reboot the PC and use a program like
"minicom" on the host PC to connect to the target and check if serial
connectivity is fine.
Any subsequent boot crashes should be logged on the host PC through minicom.
KGDB (not KDBG which is entirely different) is a kernel debugger and when
setup (is another process altogether) can make the kernel on the target
machine act like a process being debugged through GDB (the last I know about
KGDB is that it is broken and the community isn't very active in resolving
the issues).

That process is called Internationalisation . Localising means adding our
local features to an already internationalised app .
So first you have to see if the app is already internationalised .
If it is internationalised you could get the PO file .. download them
translate and give back to internationaliser who in turn compiles and keeps
the Mo file in appropriate location.

In your case if you are both internationalising and localising your
application . Please have a look at PHP internationalisation page
http://php.net/manual/en/book.i18n.php

It is a new feature in PHP from 5.3 will be natively supported from version
6

it was bought not long ago by the Linux Foundation.

Another interesting thing on the site , is the feature which allows
one to create groups for LUGs and other groups and coordinate through
the site on a global level. Also the most active member of the site
gets a laptop signed by Linus every year, now isn't that enough bait
to participate ?? ;)

Possibly add the other IP to /etc/hosts, in case you want to do it on
just a single machine. Or run your internal DNS server with the entry
for this domain, if you use it regularly and on more than a handful of
machines.

Message-ID: <601c1ad00905140509y4cfe4fdau38a7187a3a3d3565@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

GlusterFS v2.0 has gone through a major revamp in design and
development since v1.3. Thanks to thousands of initial users who
provided us great feedback and bug reports. There are a number of
production deployments now. GlusterFS uses existing disk file systems
(such as Ext3, XFS, ZFS..) to store your data as regular files and
folders. You can restore the data, even after you uninstall GlusterFS.
So, give it a try and let us know. Please forward this message to
relevant users.

About GlusterFS:
GlusterFS is a clustered file system that runs on commodity
off-the-shelf hardware, delivering multiple times the scalability and
performance of conventional storage. The architecture is modular,
stackable and kernel-independent, which makes it easy to customize,
install, manage and support different operating systems. Multiple
storage systems can be clustered together, supporting petabytes of
capacity in a single global namespace.  Building a configuration of a
few hundred terabytes can be accomplished in less than thirty minutes.

What is in 2.0 release:

Hi Folks !

I need some inputs on shared libs for an application(s) in linux .

i have a requirement saying i need to rehost all the production applications  into new Linux OS .

Here Source and target oS is Linux but with different versions 
 

so for this i need to identify what are the systemlibs, 3rd party libs , env variables and more which are required for this application to run in the production environment .

Or simply i need to know at runtime what are the sharelibs , static libs , runtime copnents it is accessing .

Many thanks in advance for your time

Do the "applications" use autotools or are they packaged? If yes, the
dependencies can be checked during configure or installation.

Else, write a script to run ldd on the "applications". You will still
need to find out which package provides these dependency libraries.

Subject: [Ilugc] [X-POST] lekhonee a desktop blog client for wordpress
Message-ID: <b399909d0905150410o675c529dibcf325d6feb73bdc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am happy to release lekhonee-0.3.1

lekhonee[1] is a desktop client for Wordpress[2].
The new features of this release are:

* Add Category
* Spell Check enable/disable
* Edit last entry

I never blogged about last few releases, I moved the codebase to
PyKDE4. It is using KWallet service to store the password. If you
don?t want to use kwallet (like you are a gnome user), it will ask you
to type-in the details every time.
Download tarball[3], F-10 rpm[4] (pushed to stable), F-11 rpm[5]

Subject: [Ilugc] FOSS app released
Message-ID: <545909.34720.qm@web33101.mail.mud.yahoo.com>


Hi all,

We have released a Free application on rubyforge quite sometime back. 
In addition to the source code, we are planning to host it for free for the Free Software Community.
The tool is basically a filtering mechanism of community ideas based on 'widsom of the crowds'.
1. Any registered user can create an idea.
2. Other registered users can 'vote up'/'vote down' the idea. A single user can cast multiple cotes to a single idea.
3. Users have a 'vote account'. When a user casts a vote, this account is depleted accordingly - so use your votes wisely. The account balance is increased when a new idea is created in the system.
4. Every idea is 'retired' after 3 months and prizes are announced based on its performance.
5. We are also planning to introduce cash prizes within a month. Prizes will be awarded to both the idea creator as well as the users who have voted for the idea. There is a logistical issue with this currently and we will be paying only to paypal accounts. If you do not have a paypal account, the amount will be either donated to FSF or to a free software project of your choice which accepts paypal.
We can look at other modes of payment in the future.

I will be releasing the documentation including installation instructions over the coming week.

Meanwhile please log in and start using the site - who knows - your idea may win cash prizes.
http://rknowsys.com/ideaxchange/

The application will get its own URL within a week and will be migrated without data loss.
The source code link is available at the bottom of the home page in the app.

I would like to introduce it to all lugs and once the application is stable, a more plublic launch is planned. Please forward this link to other lugs and other Free software enthusiasts.

Of course contributions (code, bug reports, documentation) are welcome.

Thanks,
kc

Perl Tk is readily available as a part of all mainstream Linux distros.
Installing distro provided packages should require no patching what so
ever.


For people on this list to help you, first provide a better/meaningful
description of your problem.  "i come across a lot of hurdles" does
not help anyone understand your problem.

Message-ID: <4A0EA817.4080205@fedoraproject.org>

Hi

http://blog.printf.net/articles/2009/05/16/the-olpc-xo-1-5-and-fedora-11

"Some good news from OLPC: we've decided to base the new XO-1.5 laptop's
software release on Fedora 11. Unlike previous releases, we plan to use
a full Fedora desktop build, booting into Sugar but giving users the
option to switch into a standard GNOME install instead. (This will
mostly be useful for older kids in high school.)

We think we'll need to use our own kernel and initrd, but the other base
packages we expect to need are present in Fedora already, including
Sugar; in fact, we already have an F11+Sugar+GNOME build for the XO-1
using pure Fedora packages. That build will get better as a result of
this work (although OLPC's focus will be on getting the XO-1.5 running)
and it will form the basis for the XO-1.5 build. "

Is your wireless card recognized? Then it should be trivial.

Please attach the output of:

Let's hope projects like NRCFOSS gets support from the appropriate

I wonder if the Open Source manifesto alone should be considered when voting
a party into power. BJP would surely bring in "faster" progress, but
their campaign
about Hindutva and extreme right politics leaves a bad taste in my
mouth. I would
most certainly have loved a better open-source push.

But again in all but a few private engineering colleges, Linux is
still projected as
UNIX and the command line is the first thing taught. Most still under
the assumption
that Linux is a primitive OS. In some other colleges (like mine and
more so, Jaya)
there are a bunch of students who are actively for the F/OSS
revolution and I personally
have made atleast 10-15 people switch to GNU/Linux and 1 to OpenSolaris. If the
educational system includes a F/OSS syllabus, most teachers need to be
raised to
using F/OSS or atleast a F/OSS advisor who is passionate and actively
contributes
back like Kenneth/Rahul/Raja/whoever I Left out must mentor the
college or a group
of colleges. I would love it if someone would actually come out to
mine and mentor it.
I cannot assure you the number of passionate users at the moment. Some 4-5 whom
I "inspired" have just graduated. And I think there might be around
10-20 active users
and say 20 more passive (Linux is safer for the internet) kinda users.

If the current scenario remains and we have a F/OSS syllabus, students would
start looking at F/OSS as primitive and an unnecessary burden in their
college bags.

I sure hope they do! :D
Maybe we can all sign a letter to Dayanidhi (If it hasn't been done
yet) about the F/OSS
campaign. Possibly even show that it can help cut costs of netbooks which I am
sure will be on his manifesto this term

This is clear carelessness. Facebook does not do auto-invites.

Is your wireless card recognized? Then it should be trivial.

Hi list ,
Both BJP and CPIM who have announced in their manifestos that they would
support Free / Open source software lost Indian Elections 2009 .
The winner , congress is more or less passive towards our community ( even
IT community )
Let's hope projects like NRCFOSS gets support from the appropriate
ministries . I definitely would not hope for raja :P .. may be it's maran
again !
Let's keep our fingers crossed :)

I wonder if the Open Source manifesto alone should be considered when voting
a party into power. BJP would surely bring in "faster" progress, but
their campaign
about Hindutva and extreme right politics leaves a bad taste in my
mouth. I would
most certainly have loved a better open-source push.

But again in all but a few private engineering colleges, Linux is
still projected as
UNIX and the command line is the first thing taught. Most still under
the assumption
that Linux is a primitive OS. In some other colleges (like mine and
more so, Jaya)
there are a bunch of students who are actively for the F/OSS
revolution and I personally
have made atleast 10-15 people switch to GNU/Linux and 1 to OpenSolaris. If the
educational system includes a F/OSS syllabus, most teachers need to be
raised to
using F/OSS or atleast a F/OSS advisor who is passionate and actively
contributes
back like Kenneth/Rahul/Raja/whoever I Left out must mentor the
college or a group
of colleges. I would love it if someone would actually come out to
mine and mentor it.
I cannot assure you the number of passionate users at the moment. Some 4-5 whom
I "inspired" have just graduated. And I think there might be around
10-20 active users
and say 20 more passive (Linux is safer for the internet) kinda users.

If the current scenario remains and we have a F/OSS syllabus, students would
start looking at F/OSS as primitive and an unnecessary burden in their
college bags.

> Let's hope projects like NRCFOSS gets support from the appropriate

I sure hope they do! :D
Maybe we can all sign a letter to Dayanidhi (If it hasn't been done
yet) about the F/OSS
campaign. Possibly even show that it can help cut costs of netbooks which I am
sure will be on his manifesto this term

It's possible only when F/OSS syllabus is made compulsory in colleges than being a F/OSS elective.

Message-ID: <200905181331.14344.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

I have set up dovecot in lenny. I have also set up postfix with virtual 
mailboxes. Postfix uses dovecot as the LDA and dovecot has no difficulty 
delivering mail to /home/vmail/user. The vmail user has uid:gid of 5000:5000. 
However when I try to telnet into pop3, I get this error:

May 18 09:34:43 greenchilly dovecot: chdir(/home/vmail/example.com/john) 
failed with uid 5000: Permission denied
May 18 09:34:43 greenchilly dovecot: child 24557 (pop3) returned error 89

the owner of /home/vmail/user is shown as vmail:vmail and the user with uid 
5000 has read/write permissions.

any clues?

Hi,

I would like to thank the Free/Open Source Software user group members
of Jaipur [1] [2] and the Jaipur Engineering College and Research
Centre Foundation for organizing http://fosjam.in between May 16-17,
2009 at their college premises, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.

* The event has been organized in 10 days time, with heavy discussions
on #lug-jaipur on irc.freenode.net. I was overwhelmed by the
enthusiasm of the students. The online registration rose to 280+.

We had students coming from outside Jaipur as well, and it was a mad
rush. The organizers didn't have the heart to say "no", but, they
still managed to accommodate 200 people. This, I assume, is the first
time that this kinda workshop has been planned at this place. People,
there is no need to panic! It is not the end of the world, yet, and
this is not the last workshop that we are going to do in Jaipur.

* The profiles of the user group members are at:
http://fosjam.in/about/about-lug-jaipur/

Special thanks to all of them for their energy, spirit, dynamism in
organizing the event.

* I also met students from Malaviya National Institute of Technology,
(MNIT), Swami Keshvanand Institute of Technology (SKIT), Gyan Vihar
Institute of Technology et. al.

* It was a pleasure to meet the Director of the Institution, Mr. Arpit
Agarwal, a young, open-minded entrepreneur, who was very happy and
eager to hear students talking about Free/Open Source. His continued
support for this cause, is greatly appreciated. He is happy to help us
in organizing more workshops for the young minds, or even a national
FOSS unconference in Jaipur!

* There are about 17+ colleges around Jaipur, and workshops have to be
taken to other places like Kota, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner et. al.
Most of them are affiliated to Rajasthan Technical University (RTU).

* Some students are fluent in English. Most of them prefer to converse
in Hindi. Of course, technical jargon is in English. So, it is mostly
Hinglish [3].

* A separate IRC session was organized to show people how to login and use IRC.

* Lot of them use Fedora or some distribution, and are extremely happy
with it. Those who enjoy it have realized the power of Free/Open
Source Software. The others have started to realize that there is
something important here that they can work with.

* My presentations, code, documentation are available at:
http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads.html

* Some photos taken during the trip are at:
http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album56

* The organizers could possible provide more concrete statistics on
the event. Please bear for some time for people to get back their
sleep, and you will hear more from blogs, event reports, photos.

This is just the beginning.

Best regards,

SK

Your log includes "example.com" in the chdir path, is this intentional?

Check if uid:5000 has access to the full path, ie. the parent dirs as well.

i am thinking of June 2nd week i.e (June 13 or June 14th) during the
afternoon round about 3 or 4 PM.

Bharathi: Is it possible for us to get a hall at IIT for the release party
in the evening ?. It would be great if you could help me in this regard ?

Let me know if the dates are fine with people who are willing to be part of
this

That is brilliant. I will be there. Count me in for setting this up. I
will be available
from the 4th of June (I have my Univs till then).
Let us also do something useful to commemorate the occassion.

We should possibly sit down during the party and develop a task force for some
packages. Rahul Sundaram can possibly give us a wishlist. Also, the ambassadors
here can possibly plan on a bunch of events. There is no better occassion for
giving the project something in return.

Of course, let us also distribute free media if possible.

it has - dovecot is also being used by postfix as the LDA and uid 5000 has no 
difficulty in writing to that directory - indeed this is the most baffling error I 
have ever seen in linux in the last 14 years.

Hi

Thanks for your help and enthusiasm. I am thinking whether we could club the
Fedora Release Event with Chennai LUG June's monthly meet. If we could get
the hall at IIT on June 13th or June 14th which falls on Saturday and Sunday
then we could start planning the activities .

Bharathi: Is it possible to club the event with monthly meet ?

Let me know your suggestions

Thanks,
Cheers,
Balaji

Yes. Our next meet alone MAY not be at IIT-M. Mostly we will have it
in some college in center of the city. Once I get the conformation, I
will inform to the list. But you can assume the place availability and
proceed with other arrangement.

I hope, event won't take more then 3hrs. Plz send the agenda draft to 
me.

Bye :)

The new date for Fedora 11 release is second of June. Assuming media
(mass replicated) is desirable, it would take a couple of weeks from the
release date to produce and courier it. It would be useful to do this
release party/ activity day at around end of June leaving some room for
any further delay in release. If you don't care much about the media,
then you can do it anytime.

If there is interest in organizing a activity day, there are a bunch of
things that can be done to encourage contributions including organizing
a packaging workshop/ documentation/ bug triaging etc.

Subject: [Ilugc] Forcing the screen to switch off when locked
Message-ID: <1242829352.22319.4.camel@mjolnir>

Hi, everyone,

I'm trying to get my laptop's screen to shut off every time I lock it.
It's fairly trivial to do so using a launcher with a script like this:

	#!/bin/sh

	gnome-screensaver-command --lock
	sleep 3
	xset dpms force off

However, this means I have an extra button on my Gnome panel which looks
rather out of place. What I want to know is if there is any way I can
hook the DPMS command into gnome-screensaver's lock command so that it
executes every time I lock my laptop. Anyone know of a way?

Thank you for your time,

Subject: [Ilugc] NIC web sites
Message-ID: <20090520164007.GA19777@imsc.res.in>

Hello,

I have just sent a mail to NIC regarding the web sites created by
them. Specifically, I pointed out:

a. Their web site still uses IIS which is known to have a
vulnerabilities, some of which are passed on via browsers to users.
For example,

http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/why-are-you-not-running-apache-new-iis-holes-should-make-you-rething-your-web-server

b. Their web sites are unfriendly to text-mode browsing which makes
it difficult to index information on these sites in addition to the
difficulties faced by those who can only use text-mode browsers.

The NIC people create and maintain a large number of governmental web
sites so getting them to switch to FOSS is IMHO really important.

They have a "contact us" link on their web site at home.nic.in.

Regards,

Kapil.

A bit unrelated, but suprisingly:

Did go through that and found that they have a category of linux
helpdesk. When I clicked on it, it said I should visit:

http://linuxhelpdesk.nic.in

Tried logging on to that website, but it poped-up a 404. :(

Sorry for the top post.


Looks like you have a permission problem on the mailbox directory.

Do you have SELinux enabled? Do you use extended ACLs on your filesystem?

If you are not using both features, then try o+rx permission on the
full path that contains your mailboxes, eg. /, /home,
/home/example.com, /home/example.com/user.

Seems funny. I remember in the '80s, NIC was a prime proponent of using
Xenix and SCO UNIX in Govt. They did accumulate a great deal of Unix

know that they use plone but I don't know that they have deployed it on the

Really? It doesn't look like plone.

For example, http://home.nic.in/ has been hand edited and the
comments about recent revisions are still viewable by looking at page
source!

In fact, if they used a CMS like plone their pages would at least be
w3c standards compliant.

From the error messages, it looks like you don't have the headers installed. 
Try installing the development packages for libc6.

As with the python extensions, use Cython[1] or Pyrex[2] to write extensions 
since using the CPython API involves a lot of boring boiler-plate code (also 
gets complicated in a while). If the extension is binding a simple library, 
you can use ctypes[3] module provided by the python standard library. 
I personally found Cython to be pretty easy to use.

Yesterday I was trying to do exactly same thing. In my laptop, locking
event is captured as an ACPI event and then handled by the GNOME. But
in this also screen will not be switched off. I am trying to add a
mini script to remember the lock state, in ACPI to handle this.

Hi,


Is the below possible, if yes how?

1 mail server ("ms") has been set up in a way that all mails sent to it go
to a server ("fs") that filter the mail. Once filtring is done, the "fs"
server delivers the mail to "ms" server.

Now the admin of ms server wants that mail relayed by a specific mail relay
server ("mls"), be directly delivered to it, without going through the
filtering process.

I am not sure if this can be done by making alterations in the DNS, as it
can hold MX record for either "fs" or "ms".

Hello Linux World,

I like to know the best available Linux based system audit tool.

Things we expect from that tool:
1. Option to store complete system information which are hooked to my

2. Option to get report of my network performance.
3. Option to trace and solve system complaint.

Thanks in advance.

This is my first post so pls forgive me if I have done something wrong.

yes you have! You have hijacked a thread with the subject: 'Send mails to a 
specific server'. When sending a new message, you should click on 'new' in your 
mail client. What you have done is to press reply, remove the subject and

I have seen the link it looks good. 

I just need a very simple system audit tool.

Something for SOHO business and it should mainly manage my workstation info
such as software installed, current status etc...

For a real good solution we can pay for it. I strongly believe we can get a
opensource tool with or more advantage then a paid solution. :)

Once again I thank u for ur time.

git + son-of-sysreport, should give you everything you need here. the 
performance stuff would need to be plumbed in, but there is almost 
nothing out there that can really manage / monitor a machine state ( 
performance is a misleading concept ). The state monitoring systems are 
complex enough that they normally come with a multimillion dollar price 
tag - at which point, most people just define their own expectations and 
use something like nagios or flapjack to monitor their own metrics

IMHO, mails in vernacular languages can have their translations in 
English below, for the benefit of non-Tamil members of this list, so 
that there needn't be requests for translations.

you can use split horizon dns, if you want to do this using dns. the split 
horizon will have to be set up so that mx record fs will be served for all 
queries except for queries from the special relay (ip address presumably 
known) for which the mx record of ms will be served. there are other non-dns 
ways of doing this using firewalls, postfix etc etc.

this is the height of it, I think at the beginning of the thread Ashok
made a humble request that the translation may also be given alongwith
the tamil writing, for those who do not read tamil. ( Can someone
please translate this into tamil, if he does not understand english).

Hi !

If you do  not understand tamil , then there is nothing interesting  in that
post. So please ignore it.
Why do you guys want to start another flame war ?

It will be nice if there is a translation but if not we can not insist or
force someone.

>???????? ??? ???????? ??? ??????? ????????. ;-)

he does not want to make an issue of it .

Hope people understand and be tolerant !

Hi

Thanks for your help and enthusiasm. Since the Fedora 11 release has been
postponed to June 02, I am thinking of June 23rd and June 24th which falls
on Saturday and Sunday. I guess we could use the hall at IIT and have the
release fest along with some activities which i am thinking about and would
let you all know about it.


Bharathi: I hope you don't have any problems in using the hall at IIT on
these days.

Let me know whether these dates are fine and your suggestions.


Thanks,
Cheers,
Balaji

I dont understand the hostility here. Isnt ilugc a regional Lug ? why 
should people need to stick to or need to also post in another language.

I managed to handle this by using the screenblank.sh script in
/etc/acpi. Instead of lockbtn.sh script, I registered this script in
/etc/acpi/events. Now the lock event is switching off the LCD.

New issue is, during DPMS ON the brightness going to maximum value.
I hope, it is specific to Intel GM cards.

Bye :)

Well, if it is that late into June, my college may start. We are
informed that we
have a fortnight off, starting on June-4. I thought this might come in
a little earlier.

I will help in organizing it. However, I may be able to come only on Sunday.

Hmm, on my computer, the screenblank script works as expected. However,
the gnome-screensaver lock command only locks the screen, it does not
trigger the ACPI blank screen event.

I already have a script which turns out to be similar to screenblank.sh,
but apparently the only way to make the computer automatically turn off
the monitor when the screen is locked using the Ubuntu Fast User
Switcher Applet is to monitor dbus for the SessionIdleChanged signal and
execute that script when it happens.

Other options (Working for me):
1. Use gnome Custom hotkey to run your script. That will switch off
and lock the screen.

2. Configure the power management or DPMS in xconf to switch off the
idle screen.

Revert back to original xorg.conf file, add virtual screen size
(LVDS+VGA+TV) alone in xorg.conf and try xrandr or gxrandr command.
Result may depend on your display card(?).

Firstly, it is better to avoid this kind of looping. Will become difficult
to debug problems. Better to have fs deliver mail to the outside world. I'm
talking of sendmail/ postfix here. Do not know if qmail has this facility
but guess it must. Use SMARTHOST directive to forward all outgoing mail to
fs. This still leaves internal mail. If the load is small maybe ms can do
that itself.

If it is for the domain that ms servers, in the above scheme will ensure it
does not go thro' fs.

I've seen a reply on using split horizon DNS. It would mean you need to run/
setup your DNS on a machine owned by you as I've not seen service providers
allow this. May be wrong though.

One alternativev comes to mind though I've not tried it myself. Need to
check if it works. Let MX point to a host. Let the host be resolved on "fs"
as "ms" using the /etc/hosts file and the standard resolve heirarchy having
/etc/hosts as the highest/first.

This is the solution I am currently using.

xconf? Did you mean xorg.conf? I can set the xserver to switch off the
screen after a certain amount of time, but to be effective in this case
it has to be a small value and to not be annoying it has to be a large
value (because I often watch DVDs on my laptop). Is there something else
that's possible that I'm missing?

given that the members of the LUG speak 15-20 languages, this is not a viable 
option. That is why in India we have english as the link language and 
generally we are polite enough to speak in english when members of other 
language groups are present. In my opinion, not to do is is plain rude.

   Folks,
   rather than get too rigid, let people use indian languages also..
   ignore them if you do not understand.
   a small price to pay for inclusiveness...

   having one language does not necessarily lead to better understanding or
   happiness.
   also many times, it is this reaction that is the desired outcome of the
   initiation, so don't let it go....

Message-ID: <200905231408.48236.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

I have updated avsap to run on the wxPython 2.8.9.1. It is available here:

svn co https://svn.nrcfosshelpline.in/public/helpline/branches/avsap avsap

for those who do not know the history of avsap, it was used in production for 
several years by some clients of mine, was first released in perl and then 
later ported to python. Unfortunately in 2003, installation was extremely 
difficult as cool things like yum and apt-get were not there. Since not one of 
the thousand or so people who downloaded it was successful in installing it, I 
got fed up and stopped maintaining it.

I will maintain and develop it if a few people show interest in using it. I 
think it is the only accounting software in India available in so many Indian 
languages (and Italian too). For this reason I have not set up a mailing list 
or any other support infrastructure. You may mail me if you have questions.

I have changed the license to the BSD license.

it stands for 'Chennai' which is a cosmopolitan city in the southern part of 
India, but it's membership is worldwide - and not just of people 'in' or 
'from' Chennai. The common thread linking the people in this group is not 
language or community but love of linux and open source. AFAIK there are Tamil 
OS/FOSS mailing lists which are focused on language.

Please!  The recent flame war about this issue was ugly,
and in the end did not solve/accomplish/conclude anything.

It's perfectly fine for people to have conflicting views. If some
people want to post in Tamil, so be it.  If some want to post in
English, that's okay too.

As long as the topic remains in context, just give others the
freedom to express themselves however they want.

Suggest we don't feed this thread any more.

If you paste the exact error message it will help a lot to resolve the issue.

Categorize your users and look into
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn-book.html#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authn,
specifically the authorization section. You can do something like the
following:

<snip>
[groups]
project1-developers = user1, user2, user3, user4
project2-developers = user1, user3
project3-developers = user4, user5

[project1:/]
* = r
@project1-developers = rw

[project2:/]
* = r
@project2-developers = rw

[project3:/]
* = r
@project3-developers = rw
</snip>

The above is an example, which define per project based access,
assuming you have one subversion repository per project.

Thank You.

It is a decision that must be taken by the administrator. Please read
<http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn-book.html#svn.reposadmin.planning>
in order to get a feel of how you can layout your repository.

As Kenneth said, you need to upgrade your subversion client (AnkhSVN
in this case). This error resulted, because you ve accessed the
working copy with a latest subversion client, which silently upgraded
your working copy format.

I do not get your query clearly here. What is the version of Visual
Studio you use? If it is VS2005+ then go for AnkhSVN 2.0

> my Linux fedora version 9.0 and subversion is 1.4? and client AnkhSVN is

I think you are using AnkhSVN 2.0

> Please Clarify and how to remove this one error? ie fix this one? commit
> and? update and not held in via AnhkSVN 2.0 Client
> for my VS 2005 Client People

With AnkhSVN 2.0 you get the error "Your client is too old"? Please
explain in detail, I am confused!

If you also have AnkhSVN 2.1 installed, then try committing with that.
Else use a latest version of subversion command line client to do the
commit.

PS: Please follow up on the same thread for related queries.

Subject: [Ilugc] wireless datacard linux compatibility
Message-ID: <20090527071516.28E111DB259@www.ae.iitm.ac.in>

>Of the current wireless datacard/usb devices supplied by the
>any-time-anywhere-internet services available in Chennai which all, if any,
>work in linux? Which one would you suggest?

Yesterday Reliance Wireless Broadband+ marketing persons came to my office to demonstrate
their wireless datacard where we have linux only machines and no windoze.

I have inserted their Reliance Netconnect datacard in my Fedora-10 PC and just replaced their usename, password in my
wvdial configuration and just connected in seconds and test the download speed and got average
speed of 28kbps/35kpbs (tested about 10 minutes) and it was good for browsing and
smaller downloads.

Their wireless datacards support Highspeed Data transfer of about 3.1 MBps in 35 major cities
and when I have tested 3 times, I have got only a max. of 35Kbps.

Overall it is well supported by Linux (I have tested this in Fedora-10 and the wireless datacard is detected as /dev/ttyUSB0) and speed is also good for any mobile user.

S. Baskar
CEO/LinuXpert Systems

Note: The price of Reliance NetConnect wireless Broadband datacard is Rs.3,500/- and citywide postpaid plan is Rs.1099/- per month (Data Transfer limit: 10GB/month) and nationwide postpaid plan is Rs.1,750/- per month.

1. At what time, you run this testing?
2. If possible, try at 1AM - 3AM.
3. Did they commit any min or avg data rate?

AFAIK, 3.1MBps is the total capacity of the base station. If you are
the only one subscriber in the base station, then you MAY get ~3MBps.  
But normally the base station bandwidth is shared by many subscribers.
So getting 3MBps is only a dream.

Message-ID: <289b5e200905270948v378e36eftc6c45ca4ab3aa34a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have installed Ubuntu 7.04 and Windows XP in a P III ( 256mb RAM/40 GB
HDD) dual booting with GRUB. Now I find XP takes longer to boot. But I have
no issues with Ubuntu. Now I like to uninstall Windows XP and format that
partition without disturbing Ubuntu instalation. How should I proceed to
uninstall Windows XP? I should be able to boot into Ubuntu without doing a
reinstall.

Thanks.

R.Dhanagopal

Please output your

/sbin/fdisk -l /dev/XXX

XXX- hdd

If you have installed ubuntu using wubi things have to be done
differently.

No, it is not. It doesn't really tell if you are *capable* of doing any work.

Either you get your basics right, your skills polished, and prove
yourselves with your *work* (through FOSS projects, for example), or
it will be a really, really rough ride for you.

I do take interviews... But in Java and a little bit of Linux. I don't
refer any "interview questions" to ask the candidates. I ask them to
describe some practical scenarios- those that  they have experienced
and also some approaches to the "problems" that i have faced. Do these
constitute "interview questions"?

Actual hands on experience has no alternative. Work, work and keep working :-)

1. Delete the windows partition using Gparted which is available in ubuntu.
2. create new partition and you can add it in ubuntu file system for normal
use. or you can install other OS in this partition.

I have not used MRBS before. But the INSTALL doc tells me
http://mrbs.sourceforge.net/view_text.php?section=Documentation&file=INSTALL
that you need to create a database manyually

$ mysqladmin create mrbs (Or any name you want)

I believe a bunch of tables are provided too for each DB. Choose the
tables.my.sql and do

$mysql mrbs < tables.my.sql (Do this in the directory where the table
is present or give the full path to the tables)


Open the file called config.inc.php of mrbs and in it, add the line
$dbsys = "mysql";

$db_host = The hostname that the database server is running on.
$db _database =  The name of the database containing the MRBS tables.
$db_login = The database login username
$db_password =  The database login password for the above login username

Now, it should work

If there is no special data on your system, try deleting the MBR.

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1

He told me, previous day he got around 52k download speed in his own place.

The sales guy was not so sound with technical things (when he came to my office, he was totally
unsure about linux connectivity).

I don't understand why fedora project cares to write about various ways of
removing fedora .. huh . I think fedora is better off improving individual
package documentation .
/me loves Ubuntu docs & they rock  !!
/me uses Debian .
RPM days are pass?

It is explained why in

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_uninstall_Fedora

Users have the freedom to choose what they would like install.

Sure, everybody could do with more documentation but it isn't instead of
but both.

That's fine.

> RPM days are pass?

Don't think so. Only recently did Moblin switch from a Ubuntu base to
Fedora base citing RPM as a advantage. If you want to discuss specific
issues, I would be interested.

Well, this is probably because it knows people would not need it anyway.
That is the air of confidence that Fedora has in itsefl. It is there for those
who need it anyway. We dont want to force users to work hard to do what
they want to do.

When is Debian scheduled to get something like presto? My friends can do
without 300MB of security updates every week. I know there are talks of
deb-delta, but it is not mainstream yet.

I am not flaming any distro. I just feel every distro has its place and none is
superior. There are places where Archlinux outshines all the rest. The wiki is
one of the best out there. Package management is KISS and kick-ass fast.
There are places where foresight's/rpath's conary  is much better than debs.
Respect each distro for what it does

Did the wireless card work at full speed in Windows. I dont think we will get more bandwidth than Linux.

Why are you wish to remove fedora 9?
I give an chance to use windows with Linux as dual OS.

1. Just re size your partition as required using gparted.
2. Then format it as 'vfat' file system.
3. Install windows XP in new partition
4. Edit boot.ini using boot edit tool or booting disk. otherwise reinstall
grub and add windows booting script

Sorry for the top post.


On Windows, the Reliance Broadband+USB modems default to use EDGE.
You'll need to explicitly configure the USB modem to use EVDO mode.
I've seen consistent 512kbps in Windows.

How could fedora project justify wasting it's documentation time and space

Fedora as a community should encourage and explain the need of GNU/Linux not
say that "Linux isn't everyone's cup of tea" .. why don't you use the lines
before installation in some disclaimer or fedora license agreement :P

There is something called priority .. when I see a complete documentation
with step by step documentation .. I was curious .. was there such a
complete documentation for every package fedora ships ?

Everyone in this LUG or any LUG knows how much Ubuntu has eaten the share of
RH based distro's . There might be many reasons package management ,single
cd working solution and  shipping cds for free .
I also appreciate fedora project fighting back by improving the fedora
ambassadors and marketting program by giving users individual pages/space
which IMHO was excellent .
Sorry didn't know about moblin . Why did they shift ?
With big bosses like Intel novel maybe they prefer it .
Anyways as far as I know Ubuntu rules the netbook market :P
I currently run Debian Lenny on EEE 901  . I
http://look-pavi.blogspot.com/2009/03/my-eee-901-on-debian-lenny.html
 am more than satisfied by the support from debian project . Thank you
debian :)
 Finally I would say is fedora is a great distro,the community is great but
have to improve and definitely should not focus on petty issues like
"uninstall to install windows "

Open-source software firms are flourishing, but are also becoming less
distinctive

MANY technology firms are floundering amid the recession. But many of the
ones that offer services tied to open-source software?free programs written
by volunteers who collaborate online?are boasting double-digit growth. Sales
at Red Hat, the world?s biggest independent open-source firm with annual
revenues of $653m, grew by 18% year-on-year in the first quarter. More and
more firms, particularly in Europe, seem prepared to embrace open source
(see chart). ?Budgets are tight and we think that is good for open source,?
said Jim Whitehurst, Red Hat?s boss, when announcing the results.

You have not specified your configuration yet. So we cannot comment
about the motherboard. Anyway. Fedora 7 is much older a release.

Depends on the system again. However on most (99%) of the systems it
should work. If you can wait for a week, get Fedora 11. Or grab
Fedora10 today :D

> What might be the reason for it(fedora 7) doesn't work???

You can give the specs of your pc. Also, try logging in in single user
mode (In the grub screen, press e while Fedora is highlighted in the
list of OSes.  Go to the line that says kernel .... and to the end of
the line, add the word single or the number 3).

      This turns up when the partition's filesystem type is not
recognised by GRUB. Possibly, when you have multiple hard disks, and
your grub points to a different hard disk partition, this error would
come up. Please use some live CD and try to reinstall grub.

I don't think that post is for **formatted** partition. IMO, A formatted
partition is suppose to be clean(no meaningful data).

Hi

Since there is an other schedule slip for Fedora 11. I would let you know
the date of Fedora release fest day as the subsequent month would be quite
tough for me to accommodate it but i would try my level best for sure.

Thanks for your cooperation

Thanks,
Cheers,
Balaji

If you have some data unformatted, still lying in your harddisk, you
can try the following tools:

http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk
http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec

I recovered my 6years old data from a harddisk whose ext3 partitions
was mangled due to hardware failure, using these tools last week after
looking at various mechanisms, but in my case I was pretty sure that
my data is not formatted.

What does RHEL documentation have anything to do with Fedora? These are
two different but related distributions with different people working on
them. If you want to write documentation for any particular
distribution, feel free to do it.

I am sure I can show you enormous amount of documentation for any major
distribution that deals with dual booting or interoperating with Windows
in various ways. That's where the majority of desktop users are
currently and hence dealing with a way with work between heterogeneous
systems is a obvious need.

Fedora explains what it is suitable for in the overview and doesn't
claim it is suitable for everybody. Are you unable to accept that Linux
may not suitable for everyone? The standard disclaimers in the free and
open source licenses already state this obvious fact so there is no need
to repeat it in the "license agreement" not to mention that there is no
such license agreement for Fedora.

The Fedora wiki on uninstalling it was written in response to

http://blogs.computerworld.com/linuxs_dirty_little_secret_uninstall

You seem to think that a community is monolithic entity that works on
the same direction all the time. In reality, even with shared interests,
volunteers work on what interests them.

You did make a claim that RPM is passe. Instead of clarifying why, now
you seem to add a number of other unrelated things. Just so that you
know, Fedora offers a choice of installable live cd's of GNOME, KDE and
Xfce. It also offers a regular installation CD set or DVD image.  This
is for x86, x86_64 and PPC systems and free media has been send all over
the world as well.

Reality check: most netbooks continue to ship with Windows out of the
box. Acer Aspire btw ships with a Fedora derivative out of the box.

This whole thread started because a user wanted to do exactly that.
Instead of dismissing real user needs as petty,  Fedora chooses to
fullfill them. Blind advocacy isn't going to be useful.

The Tata Indicom glossy that I got does not disclose the above setup.  
All they said is you will get upto 3Mbps in your "home" area and a much 
lesser speed when you roam.
