This is what my IPS here is doing.  Is this acceptable ?  When I tried 
to point this out to them, they were saying that it is "no problem"!

[note the private IP addresses assigned for the routers]

Heh.. yeah., this happens. After a couple of refreshes you might get
the picture. I had the same problem when i tried to refer a picture
from geocities webspace to another page somewhere else. I dont know
the reason though.

The straight answer from Suraj was:
# lynx -force_html prob.rt.who\?pl=12

But,  if one  does  want to  rename  the downloaded  files with  .html
extension, or  process it  in other  ways, it may  be better  to avoid
using "file" command as suggested by Sridhar.  Take these two files:

test_1.php
    <html>
    <h1>Test file</h1>
    <?php
      echo date ("l dS of F Y");
    ?>
    </html>

test_2.php
    <?php
      echo date ("l dS of F Y");
    ?>

 > file test_1.php
test_1.php: HTML document text
 > file test_2.php
test_2.php: ASCII text

Using "file" means doing more dirty work, which we won't want  to do ;)
Therefore, let us Keep It Simple :)

Seeing an RFC1918 IP in a traceroute is not uncommon.

For example, several routers in the same facility / the same network might
exchange traffic with each other over a local interface before it then goes
on to another ISP's routers, to finally reach google [unless there's a
connectivity problem or one of the routers on the way has suppressed ICMP,
which will break traceroutes]

It seems that your firewall doesn't allow connection to port 23. You can 
change this by running the application "redhat-config-securitylevel" 
from X. (System Settings -> Security Level).

If the telnet service on?
Try: #chkconfig --list telnet

If it is off then, open the file /etc/xinetd.d/telnet
change the line:
disable = no   to   disable = yes

Then
# service xinetd restart

If this doesn't work. Check your firewall.
First try disabling it: #iptables -F

This is Fewanet (in Pokhara, Nepal) (which is a branch of mos.com.np who 
are the authority for .np domain).

I don't understand that.  With this ISP, there seems to be no multiple 
routes to any destination (atleast until it reaches singtel).  All 
traffic has to hop through these routers to anywhere on the Internet. 
In such a case, which would qualify to be "local interface" ?

Again, between hops 3 & 4 there seems to be a big difference in the 
round-trip time.  Doesn't this mean that that part is a long distance 
(may be satellite) link ?

So you are seeing these between the MOS hop and the Singtel hop

Yes - there's heavy latency involved - anywhere from 750 ms onwards - on 
a satellite hop.

About four years ago MKS and team gave a wonderful demo on ILUGC about

Linux basically tries to get the best from other OS`s.

And everyone has to agree that windows has a decent GUI.

As the saying goes Take the best and leave the rest.So i  feel that there`s 
nothing wrong in it.

NOte : But I think Gnome doesnt follow the same way . Isnt it?

You are probably talking about KDE.  GNOME follows an ideal
methodology (HIG and simplicity) for it's design.  A novice user will
find GNOME as much user friendly as any other desktop system.

In gentoo you can just run the single command to get it working

  bash$ emerge dictd

Then setup your `gnome-dictionary` to use `localhost` as dictd server.
And also add dictd ro rc startup scripts.

PS: Soon I will be writting a mini HOWTO on this in www.gentoo-wiki.com

  It depends on the API that use. If you code directly to XLib or Xt or Xm,
there is utterly no similarity between the MS Windows API and the X API.
OTOH, if you use a cross-platform API like Qt or Mono, then obviously there
will be similarities.

  In other words, Linux GUI development is *not* similar to Windows GUI
programming. Joel of joelonsoftware.com has a lot to say about this.

Hi

I remember reading somewhere that windows gui (Not Windows) was 
developed by Xerox way back in early 70's The concept of menu
and other many widgets that is seen today was from their reserch lab. 
Also early to implement this technique was Apple Computers way back in 
Mid 70's. Of course Unix has its own called CDE based on Motif during 
later 70's.

Then in MIT they began a project to implement GUI for unix based system 
in 1984 or so and released a stable one in 1986. It was to augument CDE 
and Motiff which were commercial.

Hmm.. Long History

  The concept of windowing actually dates back earlier than the work at
Xerox PARC. Sutherland showed some primitive windowing concepts in
Sketchpad (1960?) and Doug Engelbart of SRI actually showed a demo with
video-conferencing, a mouse and windows in 1965. A movie clip of this
demo is around on the web somewhere, and I've also seen it at a lecture
by Engelbart in 2000 commemorating the 35th anniversary of the mouse. 

  However, the work by Alan Kay's team at PARC beginning about 1970 was
the first polished implementation of a desktop metaphor, with overlapping
windows, menus, and of course, the mouse and mouse pointer. These ideas were
borrowed by both Apple and Microsoft independently, but much later.

> Also early to implement this technique was Apple Computers way back in 
> Mid 70's.

  No, it first showed up in the Apple Lisa (about 1980), followed by the
Apple Macintosh (1984). Microsoft also used similar ideas in Windows 1.0
(1984) and Digital Research in GEM (1984). AT&T Bell Labs developed the
Blit thin client about the same time (1984). Perq computers developed
a machine using a monochrome bitmapped-screen and windowing in about
1983/84 time frame (this machine was imported into India and sold as
the OMC Omega 58000 in 1985).

  The watershed year for the desktop windowing environment was therefore
about 1984, when these ideas became widely used.

  In India, however, barring the early work in CMC, OMC and some of the
research groups in graphics (primarily IITK, IITM & IITB), most people
remained blissfully ignorant of bitmapped-graphics and windowing
until the early 90s, when Windows 3.1 started gaining traction.
(At a conference in 1988 about objectives for CDACT (later CDAC), there
was not a single mention of graphics or scientific visualization, which
are now the mainstay of commercial scientific supercomputing, provided
by vendors like SGI, IBM, Sun, HP and so on).

> Of course Unix has its own called CDE based on Motif during

  No, Motif & CDE are much later developments - about 1989 timeframe was
the earliest Motif code, and CDE followed later. Remember, Motif came after
X11 (1989), not earlier.

> Then in MIT they began a project to implement GUI for unix based system

  This was X (initially X10, later X11).

  Motif and CDE run *on* X, and are not a replacement for it. X is a
Windowing system. Motif one among a number of different window managers
(twm, vtwm, fvwm, ...) for X. CDE is a full desktop environment theme that
originally used Motif, but has also been ported to alternative window
managers like fvwm. I'll be showing a demo of CDE on fvmw2 at the Linux
Fest on 10/11, if time permits.

  Taskbar grouping has prior art in CDE, etc. Microsoft used it only
in Windows 95, so that patent will get thrown out on challenge, which
the EFF will definitely do.

  Double-clicking is problematic. It's there in Windows 1.0, and Apple also
had it in the Macintosh (1984), so there's going to be a fight between
Apple & Microsoft on this one. X, unfortunately, does not have a
double-click primitive, although the later GUIs (kde, ...) built on X do
have it. 

  Apple/Microsoft's patent portfolio can get problematic for us going forward.
Our best hope is to make peace with Apple.

Yes KDE and Konqueror do resemble the Windows-Explorer
experience.
GNOME is more into the Mac OS style.
You can even say it makes Linux the poor-man's Mac :)

here's how one can make GNOME more Mac-ish.

Hope you know that I'm a guy from CEG, Anna University.

My friend and I were planning to migrate some of the systems from
Windows-NT to Linux.  And we have terribly failed[1] in that process.

Some of the reaons are ..

  1. Stupid lab incharge persons.
  2. Lack of linux knowledge - Administrators
  3. Still thinking what OSS is! - HoD

Does anyone have ideas on making this possible?

PS: I wonder what the MIT lab systems are running?

One way we at Crescent Engg College managed to get
Linux PC's was to explain (force!) to them that a lot
of us were doing our projects in Linux and we needed
Linux boxes at College.

It worked! and not only the Comp Sc and IT Dept's but
even the ECE Dept had a few Linux-ready PC's, solely
for the purpose of students' projects.

Give it a try.

PS:We didnt even have Dual-boot on those Linux Boxes
citing the reason that some software doesnt work well
on a Dual-Boot machine.And those were the few "good"
ones in the labs.So for a year the staff was forced to
  use OSS and none complained.



The above point may not be in the true FLOSS spirit
but no harm was done.

  We are planning to do our final year projects under Novel Intership
program (NOSSIP).  We can state that reason to get a linux (project)
system.  But the point is in migration.  We want CS department of CEG
to use GNU/Linux by default.

  Ah.  Didn't they ask you the details.  Are they that much ignorant?

  Why should the staff use your project system? What was your scale of
migration?

Hi,

i heard from the greatest newspapers, websites about the migration to linux in most of the R&D laboratories which are doing research on mission critical applications!!

what are mission critical Applications??

how do linux helps solve that problem??

Also eager to know how linux helps in telecommunication which its ancestor UNIX used by the US defence Department??? in what way the defense dept. use the Linux?

since i have experienced linux is used in internet, web, email etc which is day 2 day operation now a days. is linux only for that??  Does linux suites every aspect of today's business?? if so in what way?? would like to know that from u all!!

Though linux has got lot of Desktops or i can say working environment, we have full control only over the commandline and not over the GUI since the lack of memory is an issue at the particular situation.

Though i showed my friend the linux OS he still tells that "atleast we must know some commands for to work in that" though he is amazed on seeing but he finds some what not comfortable.what could be the reason for this???

when i have my working environment as linux, at first i felt diffucult and i do mostly with GUI which always creates problem for me. but command line is good for me.

You can't set GAIM to go through a proxy server?

1)  For starters, set up a single machine that transparently replicates
the functionality of the NT server machines (disk sharing, printer sharing
domain control, ...) using Samba.

  After it's been in use for while, its reliability would have been
established and there will no longer be any need for the NT machines.
When the NT machines are about to be discarded, you can pick it up from the
trash and install Linux.

2)  Write to the President of India and tell him that a University that he's
been associated with is reluctant to switch to FLOSS because they're unwilling 
to learn about it.

There  was this  really stupid  protocol change  (magic  filtering) in
messenger that  resulted in filtering  out all clients other  than the
official messenger  client from Yahoo!. However gaim  folks figured it
out and  gave a new release  (0.79) that worked  with Yahoo! Messenger
(all in less than 2 days!).

loosely,  software   that  needs  to  be  running   24x7.   These  are
high-availability  apps that  need to  be robust,  reliable  and fast.
Interestingly  there seems  to be  a company  named  'mission critical

Because  linux  has  enough  tools  that saves  the  time  in  writing
things. Generally, when someone wants to get a job done, they look for
existing tools that can do the job. FLOSS has given us wonderful tools
that need little to moderate changes  to get it working in the way one
wants it.

writing  their custom apps  on Linux  just because  there are  lots of

Message-ID: <a282958a040702230136c9f61f@mail.gmail.com>

I just wanted to share what I found through an article in OReilly
website. Probably it would be useful.

Suppose if there is a command which you have to execute on your GNOME
terminal and it would take lot of time, and you would want to get on
with working on other jobs (but would want to be notified when your
command has finished executing its job), then you can you something
like this:

$ find  . -print > /tmp/list.out && xmessage -nearmouse Find command executed

In this case you would be notified on a small popup window, such as a
message box, with the text which you have given, in this case "Find
command executed"

There may be other ideas too, through which you want to be notified, I
feel this is somewhat simpler.

Rgds,
Prashanth.

Which distro? Which gaim version? If its old, upgrade.

You don't have to set any proxy setting in GAIM. As
long as your default route goes to the proxy server,
you should be fine.

Apart from that, any software company using patents offensively is 
committing *suicide* because they're opening the door for everyone else
to sue them for the patents that *they* infringe on. 

So the ironic thing is, OSS has nothing to fear from Microsoft's patents.
On the other hand, MS might exploit proxies like SCO to do the dirty
work; SCO doesn't care about being sued because it doesn't have a product
and is entirely dependent on litigation.

For all we know, Microsoft may be secretly funding an unknown company to 
build up a patent portfolio (similar to what they did with SCO) and suddenly
unleash a torrent of lawsuits against linux developers. That's the real
threat.

The problem is not with proxy.  Using ports other than 80 (to connect
remotely) is prohibited in our college campus.

I guess Yahoo messenger (for linux ot win) uses port 80 for transport
in case direct connection to YM port (55??) was not available (bcoz of
firewall).

Hope you understand my question now.

Double clicking causes needless strain on both the right index finger 
and the right button ;)  A mouse serving single click X should ideally 
serve twice as long as a mouse serving the problematic double clicks. 
The battering with double clicks can cause RSI in humans and kill the 
mouse too soon.

"Double click" does not qualify as a patentable "invention" at all, 
because it is a frivolous claim, or more plainly, a stupid claim.

There is considerable prior art if it is seen as an "inventive process" 
: For quite a long time, in buses and trams, there have been bells that 
are used like this: ting: go; ting-ting (double click in quick 
succession): stop.  The most significant click double-click prior art 
exists in the telegraph invention where morse-code is used and the 
messages were sent dit daw daw dit ....  BTW,  try using the BSD program 
morse on your system, that can take text input and output morse code. 
 The process has also been used in punch cards and paper tapes to store 
information.

As Arvind points out, these patents pose threats, and there are no 
reasons to go soft on them, which should be crushed with hard double 
bangs ;)

  Nothing.  Gentoo is all about choice.  Being a developer I am very
much addicted to Gentoo rather than Debian.

  If you're comfortable with Debian stay with it.  That doesn't mean
that you shouldn't defer gentoo installtion.
  For me it took 2 or 3 installations to get going with Gentoo (before
getting a decent Internet connection).  But debian didn't satisfy me
after many installtions (in fact I had a lot of interest in debian)

 Those are old solaris machines got from SUN (we have a collaboration

  Moreover, if one just enters the search terms (whatever he remember)
in the Firefox address bar, the result is (un)suprisingly the intended
weg page (Google's I'm feeling lucky!)

I use this feature (meta-bookmarks?) often.

  If you are sure that your card is compatible, just re-compile the
kernel configuring for your card (it should be listed under `make
xconfig`).

Message-ID: <lq7jtjg4u3.fsf@www.kongu.edu>

Dear friends,

        I am a student from Kongu Engineering College (KEC).


KEC is active in the Linux arena.

1. Me and my team of students have been involved in motivating the
   students here to use linux.

2. We have been influencing the staff and lab incharges about the
   advantages of Linux from their perspective. 

   Each person has their own need, its not just open source that
   matters to everybody.

3. We have encouraged students to form various interest groups. And
   those groups inturn are engaged in helping the masses here.

4. Currently I have been successful in getting Linux installed and
   functional in one of the departments (other than my own), and my
   department still has a few Microsoft systems for unavoidable
   reasons.

5. We are very active in our LUG meetings where 35+ (50 last meet)
   students meet every alternative Tuesdays and discuss various
   bleeding edge topics.

6. We are currently planning a national level conference based on the
   same (Linux) sometime around the end of this year. Details about
   which will surely be announced to the list.

7. Some students from our college are already working in the industry,
   making and selling projects and products in the field of embedded
   Linux among others.

8. Not to forget, there is a special interest group among staff where
   they talk about how KEC can benefit from Linux and its derivatives
   and how to completely replace the Microsoft alternatives in all the
   departments.

9. The students conduct competitions regularly and encourage the use
   of Linux and similar software.

10. All our computer centres have Linux systems together with
    Microsoft operating systems.

11. Almost all our servers are based on Linux, other than when
    indispensable (one NT and one NetWare).

12. We invite people from the industry to give guest lectures and give
    general guidance. So all the students and staff know the trend in
    the industry, among which is the fact that Linux is important.


The reasons for the success in Kongu Engineering College is the
presence of lecturers and professors who are well informed of the
latest trends in the engineering arena (not just the IT industry).

Students are very eager to learn and are not reluctant to spend
sometime learning new things. So they are not 'worried' about missing
Microsoft operating systems.

The systems team (non teaching staff) are very friendly and fully
co-operative when we want to install something. Rarely do we face
trouble, and even if we do, after explanation of our intentions we get
to install the software nevertheless.


Im proud to be in Kongu.

Subject: [Ilugc] TIP: reducing firefox memory usage
Message-ID: <8816fcf804070408456fc22585@mail.gmail.com>

Just found this in the gentoo forums.

Firefox will cache pages which leads to memory usage of upto 130 or
200MB as and when you open new webpages. To overcome this problem,

1. Type `about:config` in firefox addressbar
2. Modify the variable `browser.cache.memory.capacity` (or create new one)
3. Change the value to X where X is cache size in KBytes.

For my system with 128M RAM, I prefer this value
browser.cache.memory.capacity=10000

Absolutely!!

There is no advantage of using solaris on the desktop/workstation.
It is proprietary, in that respect no better than windows; the CDE
interface is horrible (far worse than windows) and the command line,
although slightly better than MS-DOS, is worse than linux because
it doesn't have GNU.

I don't beleive this. i completely disagree
It is not to offend the lecturers / teachers.
(i) Lecturers don't have adequate knowledge about the latest trends ( i have seen lecturers asking students to do a visual basic project -- really not a joke )
(ii)It is a sad state that today ( atleast in india )that lecturers / others take up teaching only because thay didn't get a high paying job
(iii) i have seen professors / lecturers are very business minded and do lots a part time business.

  It does have bash (not GNU bash) installed (atleast in the systems
within our campus).  But the default shell is much inferior.

 I totally agree with you.  When our `Programming Languages` teacher
was talking about language comparisons, she stated that Visual C++ was
a lot better than Visual Basic and that only few use Visual C++. Only
few are practically oriented.

 Simply there is not *free* interaction between the students and the
teachers.  If it was so, there won't be any such problems.

  CDE isn't that bad - it was the first full-featured desktop environment
for X, and was adopted by HP and IBM, among others. It's certainly better
than OpenWindows that came with SunOS. 

  You can always build the entire GNU tools on Solaris, install it into
/usr/local, and set that in your PATH to replace the default Solaris
binaries.

  Of course, there is utterly no reason to choose Solaris over any
distro of Linux after 1999. But if you have Solaris, you can make
pretty good use of it on pretty reliable Sun hardware like the Ultra 10
or Ultra 20, which can often be bought at junkyards in Silicon Valley
for less than $100.

Indeed, my teacher could not diffrentiate between a package and a language.
She would innocently compare oracle and C ( this is real )

Message-ID: <8816fcf80407041102426c2ca3@mail.gmail.com>

I'm experiencing this peculiar and irritating problem with my computer.
Pentiuim-IV,  Pctel HSP5 modem, Nvidia (66?? - driver version).

During night (after 9pm) I see my computer frequently resetting
itself.  This was happening for the last 3 or 4 days.

Before the days of this problem, I hadn't done any major system
upgrade or install.  Pctel driver was installed long before so even
that shouldn't be the cause of problem.  I installed Nvidia driver
just now. Checked everything - no loose power cables.

Can anyone explain what might be wrong?

PS: dmesg outputs only the kernel log of that session (not the
previous session).

Its unwise to make such general statements.

1. Being well informed of the latest trends in the engineering arena
   doesnt mean they have to know how the ELF headers are laid out in
   the binary images and such or being able to take up a VB project.

        If thats what your benchmark of "being up to date" is, then I
        think you are seriously wrong.

        They are knowledgeable enough to know whats important and how
        to guide the students here.


2. There are professors here who have had decades of industry
   exposure. Industry here refering to top of the line establishments,
   organizations, companies etc.

3. It doesnt matter if they do part-time business or not. What matters
   is when they are in college, they dedicate their time to the
   welfare of their students.

Don't worry, you'll get good internal marks for defending your lecturers / professors provided they see your mail :-)

Cool ma, i didn't mean that. but they ought to know these too.
Can you compare a professor / lecturer in the US and a professor / lecturere in india
my goodness, they are ( US ) thorughly dedicated.
could you let me know a raj jain or gaonkar in india.

these indian professors / lecturers are just guys who don't have any passion for technology.
they are dumb and just fit to ask some idiotic questions in the lab or else tease the students.

i mean could they compare oracle and c or recommend that visual basic is latest?

It does matter, your business is to teach and that's what u are paid for.
you cannot think about business in your college. infact you can't even do business as it will affect you mentally.
legally also it's not allowed.

 Ah! Atleast in my department, it's only the TRA's or M.E.'s who do
such things.  Professors and a few lecturers are good enough not to
ask such questions.

bash but not gnu bash????? Most likely you are seeing an older bash 
version (2.03 or maybe an 1.x version) that just doesn't work the same 
way your latest bash shell works.

Then the termcap file in solaris could do with some improvement so you 
don't get all the pretty colors you get on your fedora core 1 or even 
debian box without a little work.

The default shell is csh, which is a lot more powerful than you think it 
is.  Alternatively you could be looking at the plain old bourne shell, 
or the korn shell.

If what you have is an old SunOS (even before it became Solaris 2.6) 
that's a thing of beauty, though not one that you'd let onto the 
internet without extensive patching and firewalling.

As for CDE, please speak for yourself about it being "ugly",  My XFCE 
desktop has a CDE theme, and I rather like it, personally speaking.

Sivasankar Chander has given you some rather accurate information about 
CDE, in this thread, so it saves me repeating it all.

  May be.  But what is missing the default shell (csh?!) is
autocompletion, which makes that solaris default shell as useless.

Yes. and quicksearch is such  a wonderful feature. One can have really

Why    bother   when    you   have    sunfreeware.com   (or    is   it

there is autocomplete available - just that it isn't tab autocomplete

if that was csh, try pressing the up arrow key

You don't really need them unless gcc and other gnu utils that you use 
are the only ones that you are experienced in working with.

Correction, you don't really need most of them.

  I tried that.  The .pkg files can be installed only as root (no home
style installtions like opera).  And the administrators are reluctant
to install extra packages (maintainence overhead?).

SRS is trying to say that the administrators may be reluctant to install
anything on old Suns because of limited disk space, say 100 MB, rather than
fear of OSS code.

Possible hardware problem.

1.Generally voltage drops between 9-10pm especially in suburbs.
  Most ups/stabliser cannot work below 170v.

2.Check the RAM. We had similar problem in one of machines, after
   changing the ram everything is ok.

  What I guess is they are ignorant about SunOS configuration.  I have
seen them calling for technical support from SUN for setting up the
machine.  Atleast these machines are new, so it would take time to
settle up.

  This might be possible, bcoz the problem started when I moved my
system to a different room.  BTW, I am not at all using UPS.  I'll try
the different socket.

Check for faulty RAM module. memtest86 may help in this regard.

One more reason could be processor overheating. Check your processor fan 
and keep an eye on your processor's temperature (may be you can look 
into the BIOS for PC health status) while the system reboots.

  My point is the Solaris machines in our campus are totally useless bcoz

1. they contain old software and no GNU
2. software installation is also not possible.
    I tried installing firefox, but finally ended up with trouble
setting up Gtk in solaris.
3. The browser is netscape-4
4. No messengers, IRC client, ssh-client, nothing in that boxes.

I may better choose WinNT machines.

Atleast this problem is not in the CS dept .. and I though of
installing Linux unsuccessfully.

Definitely. And never ever do the mistake I did: I used to keep my box
open so that I can touch the  CPU cooler (with my bare hands) often to
see if  its heating up.   What happened what  that the static  from my
hands (probably) spoilt my CPU.  One wonderful AMD K6 is dead, because
of my stupidity :( lmsensors is the way to go!

dear Friends

I am using Intel WinterPark Server as my squid Proxy
sever which has inbuild 2 ethernet cards. 

1) Intel Corp. Pro/1000 (etho)

2) Intel Corp. Pro/100 (eth1)

while booting up, the system detect the eth1 (pro/100)
but not eth0: the error as follow:

etho card detectd: but seems to be not present

in gui mode, if I use 'neat' command I can able to
find both the card eth0 and eth1 as 

Gigabit Ethrnet card (eth0)
pro/100 Ethernet card (eth1)


if I use 'ifconfig' only eth1 and lo are present. and
the system becomes dead slow and none of the
applications are working. If I delete/disable the card
in gui mode the system is working at its speed.

I have also used the command 'lspci | grep -i eth' it
shows

02:1.0 Ethernet controller Intel Corp: unknown device
1019

02:1.0 Ethernet controller Intel Corp: 8201EB Pro/100
VE Ethernet controller (rev 01)


how can i enable the Pro/1000 (gigabit card) and make
it work.

best regard

Hi

I am not sure what you are asking, but if i am right you want to 
authenticate a user from the nodes. If this is the case you have to 
setup properly the nsswitch and pam to use ldap. Its available in the 
links i had sent earlier. Take care in doing this. You may lock in your 
system if you do not configure it properly.

Happy LDAPing

How did you set browser.cache.memory.capacity?  Could you give me clues 
about how I could access the parent objects of the items listed at 
about:config?  Is there a way to  directly navigate the  browser objects 
with Toos>Web Development>DOM Inspector?

BTW, a JavaScript shell available is available at 
http://www.squarefree.com/shell/shell.html
It could be used to query objects, properties and methods.

I just uploaded to my project dir calpp/src/test/pm.html at:

a simple form, in which we can add input elements dynamically.  That 
uses DOM and JS, and more info about how to access the objects could 
help to make Gecko the only GUI we need to use :)

  You can restrict the view using filters.  If the above variable is
not available then create a new one.

Hi guys,
Though I am new to this list I have been following this thread. I am a second year (CS) student in Saveetha Engineering College. We have three labs (HP, EMac, IMac) The HP labs run Windows 2000 Prof. The Macs run on OS X (10.2). This is based on UNIX and we work in these systems for our programming and data structures lab last sem. Though we didn't like the systems as we can edit the text only in pico or vi, cannot use the [del] key (couldn't figure out why?). But working in these systems were a great experience. It was very fast and very stable (owing to UNIX). But as the Internet in the college is connected to these systems, we have no access to floppy drives. Even the HP computers have only a CDROM Drive. I think there is only one system in the entire college with a floppy drive. One of our lecturer even had installed RHLinux 7 in one system (text mode only). I may get permission from my HOD to install linux in some systems(but I would rather not ask)

I would say many of them fear Linux because only a few know how to even login. My lab in-charge was surprised to see me working in the linux box and advised me to be careful as i would do some damage to the system.

May be Red Hat must give free training to college lecturers and professors about the advanced features and security of linux. Also the syllabus can be changed to include Linux as one unit in some paper.

Lets hope at least my juniors (when i am in the 4th year???) get to install Linux on their own.

In my opinion, it will be good if the professors/lecturers 
involve/consult in real business/industries.  Because, by doing so, they 
can really be up-to date with the current trend.  Not only that, what 
they teach in the class will be from their own industry experience, 
which will be of great help to the students.

On the other hand, all that a professional professors/lecturers can do 
is just to read a book (or a few) and interpret them.  Only a very few 
try to stay abreast with the current by properly browsing web, reading 
mails from mailing lists, newsgroups, etc.

Err...I'm not sure how you guys would feel about help from my side - but
here's what I've generally observed from evangelizing Microsoft technologies
and Windows

- The staff are no help. I'm not generalizing - just an observation from the
colleges I've been to. Though they are usually enthusiastic about helping
you out, their lack of technical skills is a big obstacle.
- Most of the students are not geeks..so they don't think like us.Their
definition of 'cool' is different from our definition of 'cool'


Here are my $0.02 worth of suggestions...

- Show students the 'cool' stuff. For example, I would love to talk about
how cool delegates are in Mono/.NET. But most students would probably give
me a blank stare. So the demo I usually do is to write a web service that
generates a love letter and then run a hands-on lab that walks them through
the process. 

What I've found is that instead of aiming for the students to learn the
correct stuff or the fundamentals, you're better off showing them the flashy
stuff up front. For example, I know that a lot of students struggle to do
graphics using Tc. So when I show them how easy graphics is in .NET, they're
instantly hooked. Now,is that the recommended fashion? Absolutely not.
Microsoft would be happy if I start from the basics  and work my way up. But
if I open up a PPT with a lot of bullets and start talking about
type-safety, I'll just be wasting everyone's time.

My suggestion would be to look at 2 different sections of students

1. The geeks. The people who've been coding a lot. For these guys, just have
a look at what kind of apps they want to write and then show-off how
easy/clean/elegant it is with your technology/OS/platform/whatever

2. For the non-geeks. Show them the eye-candy. Tell them stuff like "You
never have to use a pointer again. Ban the '*'"...find out what they hate
doing and tell them how if they use technology X, they won't have to do any
of it.

Once you have them interested, then you can get them to convince their
faculty for you...this has worked every single time in my case.



Hope this helps...

Regards,
Sriram
Microsoft Student Ambassador

P.P.S One small suggestion  - stay away from the religious debates on stage.
Impress them with technology rather than philosophy gyan. This comes from
personal experience - people automatically don't like it if you criticize
someone else without the other person being there to defend themselves. I've
got bad feedback whenever I've criticized Linux (however slightly, even in
jest) on stage...but whenever I've spoken only of MS stuff,I'd got great
feedback. I have a  friend who does Linux sessions..and when he cracked
jokes about Microsoft on stage, I could hear students sniggering around
me..they were whispering about how superior MS is. I was pretty surprised -
the very act of him criticizing someone else seemed to provoke hostile
responses from the neutral sections of the crowd. But whenever he stuck to
Linux, the people were pretty receptive. 

P.S Insert standard disclaimer here about how these are my views and not
Microsoft's..blah..blah

Its unwise to make such general statements.

1. Being well informed of the latest trends in the engineering arena
   doesnt mean they have to know how the ELF headers are laid out in
   the binary images and such or being able to take up a VB project.

        If thats what your benchmark of "being up to date" is, then I
        think you are seriously wrong.

        They are knowledgeable enough to know whats important and how
        to guide the students here.


2. There are professors here who have had decades of industry
   exposure. Industry here refering to top of the line establishments,
   organizations, companies etc.

3. It doesnt matter if they do part-time business or not. What matters
   is when they are in college, they dedicate their time to the
   welfare of their students.

What is so bad about doing a project in VB? Do you know the amount of VB
used in the IT industry today?

GCC 3.4.1 has been released.

This release is a bug-fix release, containing fixes for the defects
listed here:

 http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.4/changes.html#3.4.1

There are no new features in this release, but there are a lot of
improvements for various languages and architectures.

Unfortunately, the FSF's FTP servers have not yet accepted ,my upload,
and requests for help to the FSF's ftp-upload address have not yet
resulted in a reply.

Therefore, the release is only available from mirrors of gcc.gnu.org, as 
listed here:

Although lots of people contributed in various ways to this release,
I'd particularly like to recognize Joe Buck (who prepared the release
notes)  and Richard Henderson (who fixed lots of bugs).  Thanks!

  Firstly, a minor nit about formatting: please try to use a carriage
return after each line and stay within 80 columns. If you rely on line
wrap to format your paragraphs, it will irritate a whole lot of people
who use vi and who'd like to quote sections of the text above their
responses.

  The OS on the Macs is a Unix workalike, but it's *not* derived from
the Unix codebase. It's a microkernel that's derived from CMU Mach, but
substantially modified by Tevanian's team at Next computers, and also
by a group that had previously worked on IBM Microkernel (also derived
from CMU Mach) at IBM, Boca Raton. On top of it is a special Apple-developed,
BSD-derived personality which Apple calls Darwin.

  In simpler terms, Mac OS X is derived from Carnegie Mellon University's
Mach codebase, and from the University of California's BSD codebase, but
not from the Unix codebase of AT&T. In addition, it has significant
applications that are licensed under various open-source licenses, including
Mozilla and Apache.

  Please don't confuse Mac OS X with Unix! The underlying source code is
very different. It's very fast and stable because of the excellent work
that the Apple team has done in integrating the BSD components with Mach,
and has nothing to do with Unix. There had been an earlier attempt by
a consortium called the Open Software Foundation (OSF), not to be confused
with the Free Software Foundation (FSF), to develop a Unix-like OS called
OSF/1 running on Mach, and although they did succeed in releasing working
code, it was nowhere near as stable and polished as Darwin.

Message-ID: <OFD82D7AC8.3956CABF-ON65256EC9.001D5AFE@lntinfotech.com>


Hi,
We are using Eclipse 3.0 RC2  on windows 2000 for J2EE project with JBOSS
3.0RC1.
Lomboz installation is not working.

we are using build-06302004 and installed Lomboz 3rc2 and emf-so-runtime.

I extracted both the zip files to eclipse directory with Lomboz extraction
followed by emf-runtime.

The lomboz installation plugins are detected when I :
   1)open up eclipse
   2) click on Help
   3) then click on plugin details
         ( Lomboz plugins are listed. )
        However com.objectlearn.j2ee.gmf.core.editor and
com.objectlearn.j2ee.gmf.core.edit have provider as %providername and
pluginName as %pluginname.
       ^^^^
 Is this right?


The problem is with plugin activation:

When I click on
1) window
2) click on customize perspective
3) click on  submenus: new
4) click on Lomboz J2EE wizards under  Java :   Lomboz J2EE wizards is not
listed under Java.  Under Java, I see Java Run / Debug and Junit but not
J2EE wizards.

What am I doing wrong?

TIA,
Sanjay

RedHat 9 has Apache in it. You need not install it seperately. I think 
the default install includes it. Unless you have done a minimal install 
or a custom install deselecting the Apache package, you would have 
Apache installed already. Search for the 'apachectl' utility and if you 
find it, then it means that Apache is already installed on your system.

To start Apache you can do any one of the following

* 'apachectl start'
* '/etc/init.d/httpd start'
* 'service httpd start'

HTH.

Hi!

Is it ok if we invite gtcdrom.com to have a stall. I
guess they can sell their Linux products?

I am also wondering if we will be able to get a "Tux
Mascot" dress and someone can wear it and hang around
during the Festival :)

I, and my brother, will be bringing a PIII desktop
with speakers running Slackware 9.1 (thanks to Senthil
for the CDs). We will be giving a demo in one of the
stalls. Is it ok to play english mp3 songs and
simulataneoulsy show visual demos?

Let me know,

Thanks,

Who is that 'someone'? We have too low volunteer strength that
I am worried if we will be effectively run the show.

I don't think anybody will object if you keep the decibel level
verly low. Last time we had problem due to noise from quake
disturbing others.

Especially as GT Enterprises has / had this nasty habit of grabbing

Just wanted to know about them (GT) before inviting

visit them. Thanks for the inputs.

More the noise the more lively may be good in marriage party or disco
but certainly not when someone asks doubts about iptables. Last time
Senthil went home with sore throat, because he had to match decibel
level of quake. We shifted the quake to separte room on the second
day because serious topics could not be discussed.

Mutlimedia noise is just one part of opensource not the whole. We can
make lot of technical noises also.

Most geeks don't VB because its an M$ product, and I don't like it for
its elaborated syntax.

For my MCA final year project, I was asked to choose one and I came up
with the idea of doing a compression program based on Burrows-Wheeler
algorithm (bzip2 uses it).

But the lecturer said it was too simple for a final year project, for
which I said, I'll choose student administration using VB!  In fact he
was OK with that!!  LOL!!!

Shouldn't have kept a technical stall next to a gaming

Should have been done in the first place.
 
Friday evening, is it possible to go to the auditorium
and arrange the stalls, check the plug points and
decide the location of the stalls?

Hi Guys,
Well I have been tracking the thread for some time now and would that
Chennai is surely happening when it comes to Linux to a certain degree.
OK a lil bit about me, I have recently relocated to Chennai from mumbai and
have joined up a company as a CTO, not this company has a large presence on
the web and we would like to get some applications developed on Linux.
So I would request you guys to help me in finding good people, companies who
are not that expensive who could understand my requirement and come up with
a solution.
Thanks for everything.
Regards
Milind Naik

First let me clarify, by stall you should think just a table with
computer, it not like stalls in NASSCOM exhibitions.

Yes we need to be there Friday evening.

Why don't collabnet set up stall for apache and other products and be
part of the volunteers. I don't think any thing wrong with that. 
Will others voice their opinion about it to decide.

Sorry it's not bad but too bad or too worse.
Do you think a student who does a project in VB will be able to tone his fundamentals.
he will just learn how to use the Microsoft APIs

I agree  VB is simpler in  terms of how  its done and it  probably has
lesser power  than, say, perl/tk.  But  isn't it a bit  unfair to rate
someone as 'non-geek' just because  he/she writes VB code? I know lots
of  non-geek,  below-average  perl  programmers  and  some  "good"  VB
programmers.

IMHO, Its their involvement  and approach that decides whether someone
is a geek. Not what tools they use.

cheers,

We?

"First let me clarify, by stall you should think just

Even if it were just a table and computer, it is
meaningless to place a gaming demo next to a technical
demonstration.

For the general public, you want to be able to attract
the audience. The PDA is a good suggestion. If someone
has a PDA running Linux and is willing to demo it,
well and good. 

"Yes we need to be there Friday evening."

Time?

Having Brian on board doesn't mean that we are master's in apache raman,
:D. 

Well, the point was about accepting money. AFAIK, News paper adv. will
easily take up more than 20K (half of quarter page). someone who knows
can clarify this.... We can better utilize industry sponsor for this.
Some of the other things that I discussed was, empty cd's or snacks :)
or where ever we need money.

This port by spyro is not reached a demoable stage.
still most of the things don't work 
It will take some time to be "demo"able

Unfortunately i don't have anyone who owns a sharp zaurus.

Hi Raman / Kanagesh

Some quick questions on simputer.

(i) Is the simputer comparable on performance / features with other PDA's such as toshiba / ipaq

(ii) Is the simputer available for purchase ( i didn't see even a single simputer in chennai stores, what's the price ? )

(iii) Do you give the source code along with the simputer ?

(iv) could you let us know the processer / other device details ?

My brother programs in VB only, but I've seen him using lots of
profiling tools like VTune Analyzer and trying to optimize things.

IMHO people that are good assembly programs write good programs on any
language.  They try to understand deeply how things are implemented in
a language and how the code generation is done.

The idea is to choose the right tool for the right job.

Hi

I am just learning UML.

I think you are already using UML.

I have downloaded the software called umbrello 
http://uml.sourceforge.net/download.php which works in KDE. Looks great. 
I have also created some small php skeletal class and SQL statements 
using this. Can you share expertise and your bookmarks for further study 
on UML, especially for PHP5 and postgresql.

Thanking you in anticipation

Message-ID: <cce3th$tat$1@sea.gmane.org>

Hi

Thanks Sivam.

Hmm.. I think i am getting old.

Here are some good articles

1) Ref: http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/X_lecture/X_book_caller/
2) Ref: http://www.sitepoint.com/article/real-history-gui

Summary:

The start of the development of GUIs  can be traced back to the early 
1970's to Alan Kay's research group at Xerox's Palo Alto Research 
Centre. Two important projects were undertaken there:

     * Dynabook (Early 1970s) -- where the goal was to produce a book 
sized personal computer with high resolution colour display and a radio 
link to a worldwide computer network. Mailbox, library, telephone and 
secretarial functions were also to be incorporated.
     * Star (Late 1970s) where the goal was to produce a desk-sized 
personal workstation used by a single person. A high resolution display 
capable of fast high quality graphics was included. Graphical user 
interaction was provided by means of a mouse allowing options to be 
selected from a displayed menu . Later versions of Star introduced icons 
on the screen to represent objects and functions. The idea of traits  -- 
a characteristic of an object that can be expressed by a set of methods 
or data and can be applied to, or carried by, the object holding that 
trait -- was also introduced. Traits were later to resurface in last 
release of Motif (2.0) (Chapter 21).


The first commercial exploitation of the Xerox work was realised in the 
early 1980s by Apple, firstly with Lisa and then the Macintosh series of 
computers. The Apple GUI proved very successful and popular and by the 
late 1980s many operating systems had adopted the GUI approach. UNIX 
vendors such as Sun (with SunView) and Dec (with DEC Windows) and 
Microsoft with Windows for the PC are examples.

Ok



And the history of unix is here. Best. http://www.levenez.com/unix/

Message-ID: <8816fcf8040706050016a0c87f@mail.gmail.com>

We have about 500 users.  And we are planning to replace FTP with SCP
(or SFTP).  To deny shell access I used to create a /etc/nologin file
*or* change the shell of all users to /bin/false.  This doesn't work
when I want them to use SCP (which uses SSH in turns needs shell).

I installed (debian) vsftpd, but I can't connect to it from outside (SFTP).

Simply I wanted users to use SCP for file transfer but shouldn't be
able to login to shell (using ssh or ...).

Any thoughts?

I've actually seen a debugger written in VB. So before you say VB is not
powerful, I would say "think again" Vb+Win32API+COM is a pretty powerful
combination.

I think Richard stallman is crazy to have written a debugger like gdb if only he had know that VB is useful for writing debugging tools :-)

  Who cares about those apps when they are Windows only.  :lol:

BTW, don't forget the point that any language can be used to implement
what ever you may think of.  The point is in the language readability,
writability, maintainability, etc ...

  Again don't try to argue that VB is actually better in these aspects
sometimes, than python .. .and sort of that.

(Or if you're interested start a seperate thread - VB vs Others)

Yes! VB+Win32+blahblah powerful, but check out the code that is being
generated by the VB compiler.  Its nasty!  And the point of fact is VB
is proprietary unlike M$'s C# (C#'s specification has been released to
ECMA standards).  So, I guess no good implementation for VB itself can
come in the near future that generates better code.  Also, M$ is
promoting C# in favor of VB.

So, C# is probably a viable alternative for VB and its implementation
is available on both Win32 and GNU/Linux.

The bootfloppy  only contains things  that are necessary to  boot your
system.   Once  your   system  is  booted  up,  you   can  remove  the
floppy. firstly,  the boot floppy is  needed only if you  dont want to
touch your hard  drive's boot records for some  reason. Otherwise what
you should really do is to work to make your system bootable from your
hard disk.

OTOH,  by  'boot  disk' if  you  meant  the  'rescue disk',  then  you
shouldn't  be  using  your  rescue  disk to  boot  your  computer  for
day-to-day work. As  the name suggests, its used  only for 'rescueing'
your system when it breaks.

cheers,

Hello!

I just wanted to share what I found through an article in OReilly
website. Probably it would be useful.

Suppose if there is a command which you have to execute on your GNOME
terminal and it would take lot of time, and you would want to get on
with working on other jobs (but would want to be notified when your
command has finished executing its job), then you can you something
like this:

$ find  . -print > /tmp/list.out && xmessage -nearmouse Find command executed

In this case you would be notified on a small popup window, such as a
message box, with the text which you have given, in this case "Find
command executed"

There may be other ideas too, through which you want to be notified, I
feel this is somewhat simpler.

Rgds,
Prashanth.

Others of the ilk inspired by xmessage are
zenity, gdialog(a wrapper around zenity) and kdialog.
I use zenity to allow certain kinds of net send's (or smbclient -M's for

To my utter surprise, I was astonished by the recent postings by the 
Microsoft Ambassador, and in spite of myself, I almost felt an urge to 
rush and buy, try and use some of the Microsoft Software licenses and 
services. Now this list has 1000+ members, who are spread far and wide, 
that includes several CEOs  CTOs, important decision makers, and 
developers, and probably many might have been impressed with the 
Microsoft sales pitch, and probably many have consequently purchased 
Microsoft Licenses.  Is it not impressive? Now, ILUGC doubles up as 
M$UGC :)  Well, that leads to  the unavoidable.  There is no free lunch. 
 It is only fair that Microsoft Corporation sends ILUGC a minimum sum of 
atleast Rs. One Crore, for utilising ILUGC list to advertise its 
products and services through its Agents and Ambassadors here.  One 
could expect Microsoft to fairly send the amount to ILUGC forthwith, so 
that it could be put to good use at LF2004 on July 10/11 and the years 
to come.

one is matriculation and the other is CBSE

Raman could you please clarify and let the list know which school it is
that you are referring to ?

or are you having the demos at both schools ?

Hi,
I am planning to get a Cable / DSL internet access in Anna Nagar.

Does anyone know a reliable service? It would be really  great if the modem
could work in Linux.
I have redhat 9.

Hi Sanjay,

Touchtel guys offer very good DSL connectivity @ 128/256/512 kbps. They
give out different makes of USB modems for net access. The one I got my
hands on, I really couldn't configure for Linux. I do not know about
other models. 
If I remember well, you have to buy the modem for some 3000 bucks, or
you can pay a rent of Rs.100/month for it.

there is still hope.

What I suggest is :

1. Buy an Ethernet Card and configure it under Linux
2. Ask them to provide you with a Router and not a USB modem. For this
they will charge you Rs.200 extra per month, or you can buy one for
Rs.6000
3. Plug the router's RJ-45 cable into you Ethernet card
4. Fire up your fav browser and hit the Net

All you need to do is set up your router as your default gateway and
everything from this point on will work.
Touchtel has good schemes and connectivity offered by them is pretty
decent.

I am recommending this since I use it myself.

Regards,
Shuveb Hussain.

I thought you need just sshd (and not ftpd) running for sftp or scp and 
"Subsystem" option set appropriately in /etc/ssh/sshd_config (for sftp). 
  Correct me if I am wrong.

  That's OK.  But the problem is in allowing users to use scp (thereby
sshd) but without giving them the shell.

  Just include it as you do with others.  See K&R.

  in *nix, the headers are placed in /usr/include .. but many programs

  Just do a `man functionname`.  If you're looking for a specific
library, see the library docs.

There are two timings on the website 10am - 7pm and 10am - 5pm(One in the image and other in the text). Please do correct it.

The sale of CDs and books has not been mentioned. This information is necessary so that people will bring in the required cash.

Or, if you can be content with just sftp, 
http://www.experts-exchange.com/Networking/Linux_Networking/Q_20977960.html

<quote>
It is possible, however, to allow sftp without also allowing shell 
access. You can do this by adding /opt/openssh/libexec/sftp-server (or 
whatever the appropriate path on your platform is) to /etc/shells and 
then setting the user's shell to also be /opt/openssh/libexec/sftp-server.

But I haven't tried it yet.

Subject: [Ilugc] Linux cluster at MatScience
Message-ID: <20040708040001.2AA661B3E6@whitebox.dias.ath.cx>

Today's Hindu has an article about the Beowulf cluster assembled
at MatScience, which is now rated 257th on the TOP500 list. There
seemed to be some inaccuracies, relating to the description of the
other clusters in India as 'imported', while this one is described
as being 'locally assembled'. A quick glance at the picture reveals
the nodes to be off-the-shelf Supermicro 1U dual Xeons imported from
the US, so the claim that it is locally assembled must be restricted
merely to the act of putting it on the shelf, plugging it in, inserting
the ethernet cables, installing RedHat and the clustering software
and turning it on.

Nevertheless, it is a fairly important learning experience, so I guess
we need to commend them, and also for the publicity it has given to
the use of Linux in HPC.

I understand that there are at least a dozen other large Beowulf
clusters in India, including ones at IBM, Intel, Amrita Institute
and sevral other sites.

Interestingly, No.2 on the TOP500 list, 'Thunder' at Lawrence Livermore
Labs, has been assembled by a desi-run company, California Digital Corp.
at Fremont (with offshore development at Bangalore). It apparently uses
Itaniums instead of Xeons, and it is a much larger cluster. It is also
a Beowulf cluster, perhaps with extensive customization at Livermore
(The lead developer of Beowulf, Donald Becker, also works (?) for the
U.S. Dept. of Energy, but at a different Lab. His name is also on most
of the Ethernet drivers in the kernel tree.)

can't believe the 3000+ quoted by the dealers I asked.  Is there some

  I have a few additional headless systems (just the box, minus monitor,
keyboard & mouse), already running either RH6.2 or 7.3. I'll bring a couple,
if others can chip in with the monitors, keyboards and mice. (The last two
can even be bought at relatively low prices at Ritchie St. on Friday).

Hi,
I know the ip address of a domain.
When I give "nslookup ipaddress" from another
machine I get the domain name of that remote pc.
Similarly when I give "nslookup domain name" I
get the ip address of remote pc.

I would like to get the OTHER NAMES  of
the domain for that ip address.(I guess it
will be in the /etc/hosts file or
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file)

I dont have access(shell account)in that
remote machine.

What is the command to get the
other names(alias names )of that
domain(remote pc).

Thanks

Thank you. 

The school staff are not keen to stay beyond 5pm on friday
to help us to set things. Probably we need to do more pleading to
allow the lower level staff to stay. I feel we can drop the idea of
setting up things on Friday late evening, as we need their coperation
on two of their holidays.

We better be there very early on Sat morning like 7-7.30am and finish
off things by 9-9.30pm.

My humble request is, please come with all required software
pre-installed and properly setup. Avoid doing it at the venue.

Thank you for your offer.

Monitor is the most difficult one to transport. As many you could
provide it will be good. At present the number may be about 5 to 6.

If you can confirm the numbers, we can plan the deployment.

I got is by typing conio+compiling+not in google.com/linux. Try to
use google for most of your doubt. Mostly you will get what you need.

Remove the line #include <conio.h>
There is no conio.h in linux or unix gcc.

Now compile and run. It should work.
Also, if you had not typed main(),
give that also.

HowTo build simple C programs on Linux

1. Introduction

This document will step you though compiling and running simple C
programs under the Linux operating system. It is meant as a guide for
beginners who may know how to program in C but don't know how to
build a C program on Linux. This document uses simple C programs to
illustrate how to build the programs under Linux. It covers writing a
basic C program but it is not meant as a guide to teach the language.
We will also step through the basics of writing a Makefile for your
project.

This document also assumes that you know how to create/edit files on
Linux and that you have the GNU C compiler installed. An easy way to
tell if you have a C compiler installed is by issuing the
command 'which gcc'. We are also assuming that the compile is
executed from the command line. There are far too many GUI/IDE type
environments to cover otherwise.

2. A Simple program

2.1 Writing the source

The source of our first program is below:

code: #include <stdio.h>

main()
{
printf("Linuxquestions.org\n");
}




Save the program above and call it simplelq.c

Here is the breakdown of the program above.
The first line #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor directive. This
basically tells the compiler that we are using the functions that are
in the stdio library. The stdio library contains all the basic
functions needed for basic input and output for our program.

The second line main() is a required function for every C program.
main() is the starting point for the program. Like all functions the
body begins with a { (open curly brace) and ends with a } (close
curly brace).

The body of our main function printf ("Linuxquestions.org\n"); is a
function call to the printf function. printf stands for print
formatted and has complex rules for printing text, numbers to
specific formats. Here we are just displaying the
test "Linuxquestions.org" to the screen. The \n at the end of string
is a newline. It tells printf to end the line and start any
additional text on the next line. All function calls in C must end in
a ;

2.2 Compiling the Source

The compile is done from the command line.


code: $ gcc -o simplelq simplelq.c
$




gcc is the GNU C compiler. The -o option tells it what to name the
output file and the simplelq.c is the source file.

The output from the compiler will be a binary file called simplelq

2.3 Running the executable

In order to run our sample executable we will need to apply the
execute permission to the file. The we will execute it after.

code: $ chmod 744 simplelq
$ ./simplelq
Linuxquestions.org




The output of our sample program produced the
text "Linuxquestions.org" to the console (or screen). Try to add some
more text to the sample program, recompile and watch the output.

Just include it as you do with others. See K&R.

in *nix, the headers are placed in /usr/include .. but many programs
install their headers in special places like /usr/include/python2.3,
etc . Use the gcc -I option to specify extra header file paths.

Just do a `man functionname`. If you're looking for a specific
library, see the library docs.

Hi,

ConIO.h is the file that contains prototypes for console Input/Output
(conio) functions. Under linux, the terminal is a much more
sophisticated device. To move the cursor around, to clear the
screen,change text attributes like color, blinking, etc, you might
consider using NCurses which is present in all the major distributions.
If you want to do low level stuff, you might directly use Terminal I/O
functions.

you can find more information about programming ncurses from:

http://web.cs.mun.ca/~rod/ncurses/ncurses.html - by the author(s?)

or

http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/  - linux doc proj.

Regards
Shuveb.

You should not include the header file called
'conio.h'
that is not supported in linux. That is windows for
stuff so please remove that header and run the
program.

(((((((((((((((((   )))))))))))))))))))))))

If you want to run that program by including that
header in linux then do as follows: If you need any
further clarification regarding that let me know


# include <stdio.h>
# ifdef WINDOWS
# include <conio.h>
# endif

int main ( void )
{
int x=5;
printf("%s%d","dkfjsghf",x);

You can use the URL rewriting in apache using something like this
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule    ^/cgi-bin/openwebmail/openwebmail.pl /mail

  Thanks for the info. Hymn seems to be a reincarnation of Playfair,
which is an OSS application that can read Apple iTunes songs (used
on the iPod music player). Apple is apparently unhappy about
Playfair, successfully taking it down in both the US and India.

  Kudos to Anand Babu for taking over as maintainer of Hymn.

sorry for having recommended 'http  rewrite' while it should have been

you could also use Alias (or combine with mod_rewrite); well actually
ScriptAlias, something like

ScriptAlias /mail/ /path_to_cgi_bin_dir/openwebmail/

and have your rewrite rule to redirect to actual script by default.

[Commercial]
 
Dear Linux enthusiasts,
 
LINUX For You's latest issue is out, and it has a lot of content, which the 
community would like to get their hands on. In addition, to allow more 
people to access information about Linux/OSS, the main section of the 
magazine has been separately launched at Rs. 25, while the full pack (LFY 
Pack) remains at Rs 100--more details mentioned at end.
 
Highlights of July 04 issue
===================
LFY CD #1
---------------
* Xandros distro on LFY CD #1
 
LFY CD #2
---------
* Mono Beta Release on LFY CD #2
* eMoviX on LFY CD #2
* IBM's Eclipse on LFY CD #2
 
LINUX For You PRO
-----------------
* Mono Unleashed
* How to set up a mini ISP with Linux
* Eclipse Unveiled
* PHP vs ASP--A debate
* Learn to update the Linux Kernel
* Ntop: An excellent network traffic monitor
 
LINUX For You
-------------
* How OM Logistics saved Rs 1 crore by deploying Linux
* Wipro's Linux Strategy
* Xandros Unveiled
* Review: Mandrake 10
* Tips on Avoiding Spam
 
Free Form
---------
India's First Linux/OSS directory is being created. All Linux 
firms/consultants can use form in LINUX For You magazine (2 pages) and 
submit their entries (for FREE) for this directory. Rush! Last date for 
entries--31st July, 2004. 
 
Highlights in Detail
==============
 
Xandros Linux
-------------------
Xandros Linux has been known for its excellent GUI and easy installation 
alongside Windows, but was always available at a price. However, recently it 
had its 'Open Circulation' edition released. The same has been bundled on 
LFY CD #1. This distro installs smoothly alongside Windows, manages the 
partitioning automatically, and is capable (as per Xandros release) of 
installing itself even along side NTFS operating systems!
 
Mono
--------
Mono's Beta 3 installable (for Red Hat, Suse, Fedora, Windows) and source 
code are available on LFY CD #2. Mono, a project started by the Ximian 
group, is being touted as one of the best software development environments. 
Its SDK allows .NET developers to develop their applications on the Linux 
platform! Thus, the cost of software development for .NET framework 
applications can be reduced drastically. 
 
OM Logistics saves Rs 1 crore
-------------------------------------
In this lead feature, we share with the decision makers as to how a 
logistics company, based in New Delhi went about deploying Linux for their 
servers and desktops! In fact, the number of desktops they have now (running 
Linux) is 540! And in this process, they have managed to save a cool Rs 1 
crore! Guess, this story can inspire many of you to initiate the migration 
to Linux/OSS in your respective firms.
 
Why do we have two versions of Linux For You now?
=================================================
Linux For You was conceived with the aim of pushing Linux from labs to 
offices. To achieve this goal, we realised that we needed to reduce the 
pricing of the main magazine so that those who were not technical but 
curious about Linux/OSS could access the info. Hence, LINUX For You's main 
magazine was created as a magazine for everyone to read.
 
At the same time, the demand from the tech community was clear--they needed 
technical content along with CDs that bundled the latest software and 
distros. Hence, the combined pack of LINUX For You and LFY PRO and the two 
CDs is now available at Rs 100!
 
More details
============
You can get more details about LINUX For You magazine from www.linuxforu.com 
or email to me at: niraj@efyindia.com.
 
This communication aims to inform the Linux community about the information 
contained in Asia's only Linux and Open Source magazine, and we hope that it 
will be taken positively.

All of those who volunteered  kindly note.

1.It is difficult to retain staff of the school beyond 5pm on
  Friday (9th). If you want to bring system on Friday please
  bring it before 5pm. If not possible bring it on Saturday
   7-7.30AM itself. In case we could get permission to keep 
  venue open beyond 5pm I will let the list know about it.

2.Please bring power extension box like spikebuster/wooden board.
  There are only two mains available  in the school.

3. Since it is an auditorium the power may not   be very well  
stabilised atleast a spike buster is recommended.

4. Digital camera or anyother recording device welcome.

5. There is a canteen in the school. They will keep it open 
   for our sake eventhough it is an holiday. For volunteers
   lunch,coffee,snacks are arranged from this canteen.

6.All systems entering the school premises must registered with
  security.

7.Please note that the school is on Anderson Road cutting from
  Greams Road, not the one on the Greams Road itself. However,
  the distance between the two is very walkable.

Will you please ensure that

a.The forthcoming Linux Festival is entered in the events page.

b.Your correspondent will visit the event and cover it appropriately
in the next issue of the magazine.

Apple could be happy that:
1-Hymn makes iTunes interoperable with Gnu/Linux
2-Thunder takes Apple machines to a very high supercomputing grade.
     Thunder, I think runs on a 1000+ Apple machine cluster.

AB is behind both Hymn and Thunder.
Apple should instead, find ways to reward AB :)

Greetings!

What time are we meeting on Friday at Asan Memorial
School? Around 6 PM (maybe?). 

What is the purpose of the meet? To sort out the stall
locations, arrange tables, meet the volunteers, ...?

Thanks to Periyaswamy Senthilkumar for providing us
with 50 CDs and cases that can be used for CD writing.

I believe Senthil was working on a poster for the
LinuxFest 2004. Can you send me a copy of the same so
that I can post in our forums (linuxforum.com).

Kindly confirm the timing of the event, 10 am to 5 pm
or 10 am to 7 pm.

Thanks,

K Shakthi

  No, that's the 'Big Mac' machine at VPI built by Srinidhi Varadarajan,
which was no.6 on the TOP500, but didn't make it this time because
it has been taken apart for rebuilding. It originally used Apple
servers with dual G4s in a tower case, but they're being replaced
by Apple XServe 1U dual-G4s.

  Thunder is based on Intel Itanium2 (Madison) nodes (probably dual
or quad CPU, I'm not sure) and Quadrics interconnect. A planned CPU
upgrade next year will replace the Madison CPUs with dual-core
Montecito CPUs, almost doubling the peak performance without any other
change. It may get to No.1 with this upgrade.

I have rented 10 tables (1.75ft x 6ft) which will be arriving on
Friday evening.  There are plenty of chairs at the auditorium already.

Asan has requested one of us to be available before 4:30pm Friday to
coordinate the arrival of the tables. The electrician will also be
available at the same time so we can make best use of him.

I have an extremely tight schedule at the office and it will be
difficult for me to visit asan on friday evening.  Can anyone please
volunteer to take up this responsibility?

Asan has also requested that we complete the moving in of our computers
before 8:30am Saturday (start of school hours).

I'd just like to add that the school is the CBSE school which is on
Anderson road and not on Greams road as stated in the website and the
poster
When you mention auditorium, there is only 1 auditorium on the anderson
road school which is next to cochin house.

Kindly note the address as follows
Asan Memorial School
Anderson road (the same road on which the british embassy resides)
Next to cochin house
Chennai
Easiest way to reach school is
Get down on college road or IDM or DPI (for those of us coming by bus)
it is walking distance from there.

hi,

it would be helpful if owners of all machines create a 
user 'lf2004' with password 'lf2004' beforehand. this
will help other volunteers use you machine for demoing

Anyone coming to LF with DVD Drive. Kindly get in touch with Mr Muthu
and try to arrange the Rev OS Show. I "hope", Mr. Shiva is having DVD
player.

If possible someone bring DVD Player + TV and run it in side of the 
Hall.

  OK, I'll get a DVD player, but somebody has to get a TV or video
monitor (not a VGA monitor). Muthu can bring the DVD with him to the
venue if he's a volunteer; even otherwise, if he comes in early on
Saturday, we can run the DVD from time to time and return it on Sunday
evening.

Do you already have a phone? or  can you get a seperate phone line for
this  connection?  if   you  can,  then  tata  indicom   would  be  my
recommendation (in bangalore, tata indicom does pretty decently. I get
like 10K/s at nights and around  3-5K/s during the day). They charge a
flat Rs.1500/- per month. No limits on usage hours / bandwidth.

and  yes, the  modem thats  inbuilt in  the phone  is  configurable in
Linux.

  What is the phone number used for dialing to this ISP?  If it starts
with 172... then I can use that with my permanent BSNl line.

  BTW, don't go for BSNL Sancharnet... the service (including mail
service) is poor .  But the speed is good (4.7 KBps)

The phone number is the number  of your own phone. There is no special
ISP number.

 The reply to field should contain the sender (or atleast as part of).
 Otherwise it's difficult to find out who sent that mail.

Sender's email address would be in the from: field.
Reply to field would contain the mailing list's emails
address.. That is usually the norm afaik..

  But the disadvantage is tata indicom (I assume this is dialup

If the argument is solely that private messages *may*

current settings:

a)take getting used to as they are not the norm across
mailing lists all over the Internet, be it Mailman,
egroups or whatever..

b)Using default reply to all ensures that 2+ copies of
the email (sender, list and cc:s as in the case of
this email) are sent for every email.. which in the
end adds up as useless email traffic. Mailman has a
setting to prevent duplicate emails from arriving in
your mailbox for this reason, but it seems to be
turned off by default. Moreover, a few members seem to
be sending emails to both addresses of the list, which
will compound things even further. This is besides the
fact that it is more work overall..

c)The last couple of times I'd asked questions on this
list, I was wondering why a coupla people were
replying to me in private. Now I guess I know why :)

d)Private messages are sent very rarely, and thus ease
of use far outweighs the problem of hastily sent
private emails. Imagine the case where members of this
list who are used to sending private messages join
another list, which is very likely to be un-munged..
pandemonium :D

e)This is just a(nother) Usenet anachronism :P

Also, nobody has contacted me yet regarding the
reporter's contact details.

Take care,
Dinesh

yep, tata indicom works out to be a good deal only if you already have
a tata indicom phone OR are  planning to get a phone connection. Given
that its WLL, its wonderful for  me to move around within my home with
my laptop. Useful especially when  some annoying relative kids want to
play games at the same time you want to be on the Internet. You can go
hide in the room where your pet dog lives... ;)

Hi,

I have installed some perl modules from CPAN. Is there any perl script 
which will uninstall the perl module that has been installed, or do we 
have to go to say

/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.1/myperlmodule.pm
/usr/share/man/man3/myperlmodule.pm

and delete them manually.

Regards

NOTE: This is where it installs perl modules in Fedora Core 1

  Linux Festival 2004

It was a Diwali that came too soon.  The festive mood and spirit at LF
2004 was more dynamic than the energy levels on Diwali:) I wore my new
FSF-India T-Shirts,  packed up my  new crackers, err...   distros, and
landed at  Asan Memorial School to take  part in the fire  works. As I
walked into  the auditorium,  I was greeted  by Bharati, who  was busy
putting  up the  ILUGC banners.   Raman  and Bharati  worked with  the
volunteers, organizing  and putting everything in its  place, and soon
the stage was set for a dazzling show, inspite of the intermittent and
unpredictable power supply. 

Volunteers took  their positions around the hall,  and started various
demos on  installing and using  various programs.

Hariram and  Senthil showed Zha Linux,  from where it  is possible for
someone who knows _only_ Tamil  to use OpenOffice, Mozilla and several
KDE  applications.   Those  of  us  familiar  with  the  manual  Tamil
typewriter keyboard layout have  been accomodated, and it provides for
exchange of email in Tamil.  The visitors had the privilege of shaking
hands with  the developers themselves that included  Hari, Senthil and
Bharti, who have taken the lead in providing continuity for one of the
oldest ancient languages that is yet youthful and active.

Raman had a couple of  machines loaded with games and educational free
software   that   attracted  large   crowds   of   kids  and   college
students. Many  kids tried  playing the games,  and were  soon hooked,
more anxious about their scores by now.

Senthil Kumar and his team were very excited about various distros and
the  discussion there  was  exactly  like how  we  discuss crakers  on
Diwali, from the  good old red [hat] fort,  luxmi vedi [Slackware], to
the new ones that hit the market recently [Gentoo, Knoppix etc].  They
quickly  fired  up these  various  distros  in  succession from  their
workstations, and I could hear the loud cheers two tables away!

Anand Saha  and his team  showed Samba installation, and  gave indepth
information  on  configuring Gnu/Linux  systems.   Saha patiently  and
elaborately answered  to questions from  the visitors, which  I should
say was enlightening for me also, as  I was almost next to him most of
the  time.  Praveen  and Saravanan  were there  everywhere,  fixing up
things.

The only mistake in LF2004 was probably me.  The systems available for
the show were low, I volunteered to  take to the show, an old PII that
I retired  two years ago,  which fortunately got  a new lease  of life
from  the  skilled  hands  of  Manohar  and  Saravanan,  the  hardware
engineers  around there.   It was  soon up  and running  but I  had to
install SuSE  7.0 from  scratch, that went  on until lunch.   Two guys
from a college in Sriperumbudur were interested in PHP and PostgreSQL,
for their  project, and  they kept me  busy while my  installation was
going on.   Only after  lunch, I could  install PostgreSQL,  and Raman
created a  test table giving  SQL commands and  put my system  to demo
use. This  system was  at runlevel  2 throught the show.

Sivasankar  Chander   was  meanwhile  on  the   stage,  arranging  the
multimedia  projection  system.   Soon  RedHat lit  up  the  projector
screen, and  Sivasankar Chander  did a live  Red Hat  installation and
showed  the  audience the  simple  steps  involved  in installing  and
running  one  of  the  most  commonly  used  Gnu/Linux  distributions.
Bharati joined Sivasankar to answer queries on installing Red Hat.

There  was also another  multimedia show  at the  end opposite  to the
stage  by  one  of  our  friends. Soft  spoken  Venki  from  Collabnet
explained about  server tools to  visitors. Sridhar showed  Gentoo and
other distros.   There were plenty  of posters, including the  ones by
Vijay, that explained terms like  GPL and copyleft. The recent book by
RMS -"Free Software, Free Society",  was available at the entrance for
people to pick and read.  By  lunch time, the visitors must have had a
lot of  input about what free software  is all about, and  I hope that
the 300+/-  who visited the  Festival, could share our  enthusiasm and
start using Gnu/Linux.

Lunch was a set of pipping hot puris and cold curd rice.  After lunch,
the activites  continued.  By 5.00  PM Sivasankar screened  the movie,
The Code, using  zine.  With that, the first day of  LF2004, came to a
close.

What is  a Diwali  without sweets?   I should say  that I  found every
volunteer at  LF2004 sweeter than  the sweetest gulab  jamoon, jangri,
halwa or ladoo I  had in my life:) It was a  very pleasant day for me,
having   met   Raman   and   Bharati,   the  key   duos   behind   the
event. Mr. Milind  of Wisden CrickInfo spared 6  monitors for the show
which  met  an  important   need  for  the  show.   Sivasankar,  Saha,
Saravanan,  Manohar, Senthi,  and  every other  volunteer, all  joined
together making a fine impressive show.  There were also several minor
debates  in circles  about  giving a  formal  organisational shape  to
ILUGC, so that more such events  could be organised in the future in a
better way.

I hope  that more feedback can  come, covering the many  things that I
might have missed writing here :)

I want to add enourmous amount of users with specified passwords

doesn't accept passwords from non-stdin stream and `adduser` command
requires encrypte version of password if at all passed is needed to be

In Mozilla mail, I would like to know, how I can
configure multiple 
accounts using a Single SMTP server..

Example:
I have 5 acounts hosted at "example.co.in"

Each time when I need to send a email, I need to send
it by the same 
server (smtp.example.co.in)
But I need to log on the server with the account name
and its associated 
password.

Like this:

mine@example.co.in
smtp.example.co.in
pwd: aaa

me@example.co.in
smtp.example.co.in
pwd: bbb

myself@example.co.in
smtp.example.co.in
pwd: ccc
....
..

Please do give me some insight!

I tried the make command but it gave some error messages. I dont

step-by-step instructions on installing the modem as I would like to

Hi ,
I have  a question regarding the download speeds of dialup modems ?????????
i am using a dial up modem and it connects to the net @ around 48 kbps , why
cannt we use the full bandwith or atleast half of it around 20 kbps for
downloading files , files r downloaded @ the rate of around 5kbps ,( even
after using download accelarators it is around 6 kbps )   is it possible to
use atleast half of the bandwith for use , why is this restriction..........

Note : ( this is the case when no other activity or surfing is done while
download, so that the entire b/w is dedicated to download )

Regards,

Hi Ranjith,

    In Mozilla Mail/Thunderbird/Kmail, whether you like it or not, all 
the accounts you create use the default smtp server to send mails. There 
is some reason for this, as I read in Thunderbird documentation, but I 
don't remember what. So, all your accounts, say mine, me & myself fetch 
mails using different accounts/passwords, but to send mails, whether you 
select the address of mine, me or myself, will go through mine's smtp 
server(If it's the default/first account).

Regards,
-Vamsee.

P.S: By the way, I'm a new member to this list. Came to Chennai 3 weeks 
back from Hyderabad, so far, I'm lovin' it here :)

Hi Srinivasan!

The installation is pretty simple. My documentation is
at:

http://www.geocities.com/shakthimaan/modem.html

> /usr/include/linux/version.h:14:2: #error "To build
> kernel modules please do the following:"

Looks like you don't have your kernel sources
installed. The /usr/src/linux is a symbolic link file
that points to your kernel sources. For example, in
Red Hat 9.0 it will point to /usr/src/linux-2.4.20-8
directory.

Follow the instructions given within "" and try again,

Good luck,

Shaks

This kind of attitude is the most irritating aspect I found in
organising. 
My humble request to all, please do not irritate the people who do
the work, if you can volunteer please do it, if not no problem,
nothing wrong. Don't think people orgranising have no work. We are
also human beings in respectable position,having our own work, family
and responsiblities. If anyone want to contribute something
contribute with whole heart. There is no compulsion for anything and
similarly there is no compulsion on the people who volunteer also. We
 are NOT servants to wait for MASTERS TO WAKEUP, do seva.

Do what you can, if not no harm in keeping quiet, that helps us than
this pseudo help. 

Virtual help on mailing list is of no help, we need people in flesh
and blood.

I see no point in organising anymore event when even ilugc members
though free are not ready to forego few hours of sleep.

Hi,
 Just posting here as Eclipse is an open source project and Lomboz is open
source too.


am using eclipse 3.0 rc2 and  Lomboz ( corresponding version). Lomboz for
the corresponding version requires emf runtime (which is available on
downloads of Lomboz page).

if c:/ eclipse is directory extract Lomboz to c:/eclipse and emf runtime to
c: ( emf runtime has c:/eclipse in its path)

make sure eclipse is closed during this time.  start eclipse. go to  window
: click on customize perspectives

under submenus select new:

in explorer bar of the same window, u will find  under Java , Lomboz J2EE
wizards, select the check box and click ok.

P.S: check that Lomboz is extracted to right directory. had directory
gettin messed up.


HTH,
Sanjay

hi,
you can try with the follwing two scripts...

getlist.sh will get the list of users from the given file

#start getlist.sh
#!/bin/sh
echo -e "Enter the file name of the user list"
#echo -e "\n\n\n\t\t"
read userlist

exec ./createid $(cat $userlist)
exit 0
#end getlist.sh

 it will create user ids and give passwords as u specified in a simple text
file using tab or space as a separater...
#start createids
#!/bin/sh
while [ "$1" != "" ]
do
LOGIN_ID=$1
shift
Pass=$1
GRP="popusers"
#echo "" >> useradd.log
#echo -e $LOGIN_ID >> useradd.log
useradd -g $GRP -d /local/$LOGIN_ID -s /bin/bash -p $Pass $LOGIN_ID
#echo useradd -g $GRP -d /local/$LOGIN_ID -s /bin/bash -p $Pass $LOGIN_ID >>
useradd.log
echo $Pass | passwd --stdin $LOGIN_ID >> useradd.log
LOGIN_ID=
Pass=
shift
done
echo "ALL DONE!"
exit 0
#end createids

This follwing command will get the password from standard input.

echo $Pass | passwd --stdin $LOGIN_ID

I hope it will work.

  This has nothing to do with your modem, and everything to do with the
upstream bandwidth of your ISP. The upstream bandwidth is shared among
all the active connections of the modem pool, so if there are (say) 400
users who are connected, and an upstream bandwidth of 2 Mbits/sec (typical
in India), the average bandwidth that each user will obtain will be about
5 kbits/sec.

  There's nothing you can do about it, except complain to your ISP to
increase the upstream bandwidth, or switch your ISP to one that has
adequate core (backbone) bandwidth.

  BTW, if you believe that 'download accelerators' actually work, then most

and for adding multiple users (or an enormously large amount of them)
for i in `seq 1 100`
do
useradd foo$i -p `openssl passwd -1 bar`
done

would add users foo1 foo2 and so on

  Virtually every PCI modem card is a WinModem. If you try to use a
WinModem in Linux, you're on your own. The solutions are:

1) Return the PCI modem, and get a good external modem that connects to
a serial port.

2) Attempt to build the WinModem driver from source and solve all the
build & configuration issues on your own.

P.S. WinModems are *lousy* idea, created by the Intel/Microsoft duopoly
to try to shave a few cents of hardware costs, while ensuring a lock-in
to the Wintel platform.

Hi list

Could you please wlan accesspoint ( minipci or pci card ) that is know to work in linux

Suppose i buy a WLAN card, can i make it to work as a accesspoint ?

or is there separate WLAN cards that works as acesspoint that is different from normal.

i need only boards that operate in 802.11g mode

First of all,

Thanks to everyone for sharing their views. I really appreciate it.

I have been observing information about Linux meetings and linux fests.It
requires a tremendous
amount of effort.  The work done has been great. I understand that people
have put in a lot of work
 and sincerely taken time out of their personal life to invest time in it,
and I appreciate it.

It is true that I am not volunteerin for the fest.   I apologise for that.
We have a challengin project and I
get hardly 5-6 hrs sleep a day as I am managing the team. We work on
saturdays also . Sundays are
when I catch up on my sleep.

I  love linux.  I am trying to get Linux in organizations and I even tried
to get it into my school.I have been
taking help from this list for a long time and wanted to help ( even if its
the smallest miniscule thing). If I can
give solution to problem, I do. I am also subscribed to Singapore, Debian
and Kalamazoo lists.

Its the collection of miniscule things that becomes a huge thing.  I had
extra copy of  FreeBSD and
 thought people might benefit from it.Works been extremely hectic and
havent had the chance to
see the mails. Otherwise, I would have offered earlier and people could
have benefited from it.

Also use Sundays to  try out new versions of Linux.

P.S : I also have Open BSD 3.3  on one cd and  Open SSI ( open source
clustering solution). If anyone is
         interested. contact me.

Linux For you July edition has XANDROS cd.

If u still think this is Pseudo help, cant say much.

Regards,
Sanjay

  Access points (APs) are not cards, either in the PCI or miniPCI form
factor. They're stand-alone appliances, and you don't need a driver for
an AP. They're sometimes configurable using a web interface.

> Suppose i buy a WLAN card, can i make it to work as a accesspoint ?
> 
  Yes, but only those cards that support 'host' mode. Examples include
any card that uses an Intersil (now Connexant) PrismII, Prism2.5, Prism GT
or similar chipset. You need the HostAP driver and wireless tools to
make this work. It's not really worthwhile to use a card as an AP, since
you need to commit a whole system to it, andi standalone APs now cost much
less than $100, sometimes as little as $20.

> or is there separate WLAN cards that works as acesspoint that is different from normal.
> 
  See above. Only certain chipsets support host mode, and only these can work
as APs using the HostAP driver.

> i need only boards that operate in 802.11g mode
> 
  Your choices are fewer here. Only the Prism GT is an 802.11g card that may
also have HostAP support. The Atheros and Broadcom chipsets have some
degree of Linux support, but only as client devices (AFAIK).

  Under no circumstances should you get any of the el cheapo Marvell and
similar far-eastern chipsets. None of these have *any* Linux support.

  The short answer is: stick to Prism chipsets from Connexant.

Hi bsd unix!

Yes, depends on the card chipset and the driver. In
general, you can operate a WLAN card in these modes:
- Ad-hoc
- Managed
- Master
- Repeater
- Secondary
- Monitor
- Auto

The Master option allows you to use it as an AP. More
on configuration issues by reading the man page for
'iwconfig':

#man iwconfig

Thanks.  The event was well organised, and naturally the summary could
follow suit.

But, I missed writing about:  Mr. Raja Subramaniam, who obtained space
for the festival from Asan Memorial, and who also hired the tables for
the computers; Mr. Arun and others who volunteered resources that made
the event possible.  From the recent  post of Mr. P. Raman, I now know
that he could be a little karam too ;) But I guess all that is over :)

The visual impact created by a Gnu/Linux installation is unmeasurable,
and with a little help and guidance from experts, many can confidently
change over  to adopting free  software.  As Mr.  P.   Raman requests,
more  volunteers in blood  and life,  could make  a big  difference in
taking forward this great movement. At shows like this, I wish that as
many computers  as possible are  networked, and even connected  to the
internet,  so that  the true  scope of  a Gnu/Linux  system  can reach
visitors. Unless  more volunteer  to contribute, Gnu/Linux  may remain
untried and unused by many who deserve this best operating system :) 

Regards,
Ramanraj.

Message-ID: <004e01c4687c$4f2d78b0$ce7b41db@tcet>

Thanks Mr.Sivasankar Chander for ur reply regrading the speed of dialup
modem.......

but also see what ans Mr.Suraj has given to this question......

----------------------------------------------------------------------
When you  buy a '56KBPS' modem, what  you are buying is  a 'modem that
can do 56000 bauds per second' and  NOT a 'modem that can do 56 x 1024
bits per second' (and certainly not  '56 kilo bytes'). so in the modem
parlance, the KBPS stands for 'kilo bauds per second'.

one baud == one 'pulse' (ie.,. one bit). so if you have a 56K modem it
means it can send 56000 bauds in one second (note that the 'k' here is
not 56 x  1024 but 56 x 1000.  (its the  electrical equivalent and not
the computerese equivalent)).  that means 56000 bits are sent...

ie...

56000 / 8 = 7000 bytes

7000 / 1024 == 6.8 KB (Kilo Bytes where 1 kilo byte = 1024 bits)

now, does that explain why your download never crosses 6.8KB/s? :)

and  another thing... download  accelerator is  nothing but  a program
that  spawns multiple  processes (or  threads) that  downloads various
segments of the same  file at the same time. It does  not do any other
magic to  increase the "speed".  What  it really does it  have as many
requests on  the server from which  it is downloading.

Uninstall can be done as
rpm -e packagename   
In your case webmin

And controlling net is you`ll have to log into webmin    
http://yoursystemhostname:10000    [If you have configured 10000 as port]

GO to networking tab
Select network options and configure.Its graphical and doesnt need much of 
explanation

Hi List

My requirement is to connect a PSTN telphone ( POTS ) telephone to the PC.
The PC can can have either a PCI board ( containing a RJ-11 interface ) or can be a USB device ( again containing a RJ-11 ) interface.
I will connect the PSTN phone to the RJ-11 interface and make calls through the Internet.

My question here in 
(i) Is there any PCI / USB VoiP boards available in chennai ?
Please also let me know the Linux or freebsd drivers available for these boards ?
(ii) I know there is a IPJ ( Internet phone jack PCI board ) available for this purpose. But could not locate the dealers in chennai ? Anybody who is aware of this please let me know ?

Overheating of the processor is a definite annoyance though.

My CPU has at least two extra cooling fans and lots of space for air 
circulation / ventilation, so that's a great help.

yes,  2.6  is  available  on   debian  in  the  'testing',  'sid'  and
'experimental' trees.  If you are new to  debian, 'testing' (otherwise
known as 'sarge') is recommended. 

http://www.debianplanet.org/node.php?id=1094

The above explains the stuff required  to move to 2.6 on debian. There
are only a few minor impacts expected (like mouse device, etc.,.)

The latest stable release of Debian is 3.0 which has only kernel 2.4 and 
not kernel 2.6.

To get your hands dirt with kernel 2.6, you can go for 'sarge' (code 
name for next release) or 'sid'. You can go to debian.org to find the 
difference between these two. http://www.debian.org/releases/

FYI, I think current snapshot of sid or sarge comes around 14 cds.

HTH.

Unfortunately, I deleted the Linux partition using 'fdisk' utility. During booting, my

Please help me to change the boot loader and access the remaining OSs.

Boot sytem Using a normal win98 boot disk.
Go to command prompt
Type

fdisk\mbr      (or fdisk/mbr I am not sure but its one among these two)

This will remove grub from mbr and allow you to boot into windows

Two ways to do it.

* If you have Windows 98 startup disk, then boot with it and in the 
command prompt (C:\>) type 'fisk /mbr'. This should restore the boot 
record for you by cleaning the MBR which has the GRUB.

* If you have Windows 2000 bootable installation disk, boot with it and 
go for 'Repair' option. Once you are in the recovery console, type 
'fixmbr' to restore your Windows 2000 boot record to MBR.

HTH.

If you are interested, you can collect the CDs from me, copy it and 
return them back.

Sarge has almost 12000+ packages I suppose.

Regarding hardware architecture, for every hardware architecture, you 
have to download seperate CDs for each architecture. I mean 14 CDs for 
x86. If you want it for IA64, you have to download 14 CDs (for IA64) 
again and you cannot use the x86 CDs.

Hi all,

Thanks for the feedback.

1)which processor do u recommend in athlon XP series and which motherboard is suggested  to accomodate a  good graphics(NVDIA)  and sound cards ? i heard its mostly used for gaming but how is the performance if i use it for medium to large scale computational purposes ? 
2)also is there any computer hardware magazine which has details of the same with uptodate prices ?

Try tomshardware.com for good reviews about hardware.

Depends on what processing you want to do - numbers? images? etc etc.

Prices?  I suppose PC Quest or Dataquest for Indian prices - PCQ at 
least was fast turning into a huge price list with product reviews 
attached, more than anything else, when I last read a copy (3..4 years 
back).

Yes you  can skip some  CDs but you  have the risk losing  some really
cool games. ;)

Alternatively you can do what I did whenever I need things:

0. Get only  the first installation CD  of debian and  install it onto
   your machine.

1. find friends in  "powerful places" (like a Tom  Jose Tharayil in an
   MIT Chromepet where there is decent bandwidth during weekends).

2a.  Take  your  harddisk  to  that  friend's place  and  do  all  the
   installation you want to do in a while (!happy) loop. 

  --OR--

2b. If  your friend  has just done  an apt-get  upgrade on one  of his
   machines and not  deleted the 'downloaded debs', copy  all the debs
   from /var/cache/apt/archives/  of a machine in  your friend's place
   to your hard disk's  /var/cache/apt/archives/ and do apt-get update
   and apt-get upgrade (this copying  of files helps reduce the amount
   of packages downloaded by a large extent).

3. Return as a happy guy

cheers,

  -Suraj

Hi,
You could also try   http://www.anandtech.com/

Has nice reviews.   AMD site has good information. They might have
information on compatible motherboards.
Off the topic, if u plan to put windows,  I have had problems with Asus
motherboard and Nvidia onboard audio and video drivers for win98.  worked
with XP.

worked nicely with Linux .

ask vendor to recommend a compatible  motherboard for processor.

Been using Athlon for nearly 4 yrs. pretty good. In U.S AMD and Intel
dominate the markets.  If u r gettin assembled one, make sure u get it from
an assembler one who knows what hes doin.

Regards,
Sanjay

I don't think it is distro. But you can download the relevant kde
packages and install. Please contact rhariram at vsnl dot net.

Apache is web server, you need to have servlet container like tomcat or
jetty to execute your servlet code. Using mod_jk connector, you can
connect apache with tomcat for all your servlet/jsp processing.

Tomcat itself has built-in web server capabilities, you don't need
apache for development & testing purposes. This following url has more
information.

http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/

http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.1-doc/config/jk.html

HTH,

Check your mixer settings. Normally Linux drivers gives more sound 
(distortion as well) compared to Windows drivers.

I don't think that they will have a common password. The passwords would 
be scrambled. Anyone else can clarify this?

> 3.Is there any MD5 Decryptor?

MD5 is one way encryption IOW hash. I think brute-force attack is the 
only way to crack it which is virtually impossible for a well-formed 
password.

You can try 'jack' (from 'jack  the ripper') to do a dictionary attack
to  crack  the  password.    Only  weak  passwords  get  cracked  this
way. However  if you want to  find out passwords on  your own machine,
its not what  you should be doing.  Look at the  friendly man pages of
gpasswd, passwd  (do a  man -k  passwd and read  all the  relevant man
pages).

 Why do you need that?  My filesystem layout is basically something like this ..

6 GB    -   /                    - gentoo root partition
10 GB  -  /space/one     - data partition
10 GB  -  /space/two     - data partition
10 GB  -  /space/three   - data partition

Since I have mixed content in all those data partitions, I didn't go
for descriptive mount points (just one, two, three).

  i have no problem working with unix filesystem hierarchy. i felt it will be easier for windows users to migrate to linux without any difficulty if the file system abstraction is similar to windows.does any distribution provide such abstraction ?

   Most newbies migrating from Windows should be having bulk of their
HD devoted to FAT.  Distros like Mandrake will automatically configure
fstab to mount them on /mnt/win_c, /mnt/win_d, ...    Isn't that
enough?

  If you feel a better idea, submit a bug report to the distro developers.

MD5 can be cracked only by brute-force method. The cracker program
will apply the MD5 algorithm on passwords and check if it is same as the
given passwd file. This is done using a dictionary and if that wasn't
successful it tries the incremental mode where combinations of words
based on a wordlist are tried. This method can run for several days.
I tried John, the Ripper on a sample passwd file and found the root
password within 4-5 hours (siz lettered). Now I am trying on a passwd
file from my college computer. It is nearly 11-12 letters(tried to peep at
the keyboard) and will run for many weeks on my system.
If someone can help me to find it (has a fast processor) please contact me.

Subject: [Ilugc] Resolving Host
Message-ID: <20040714234645.39931.qmail@web8310.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hello,

When Connected to internet, resoving host takes more
than
20 seconds in Fedora Core 2. I use deafault mozilla
browser. Even konqueror has the same problem. I
googled & found lot of people are having same problem.
One suggestion is turn ipv6 off  by adding the
folowing lines.
to disable ipv6 you just add the following line to
either /etc/modules.conf for 2.4 kernel or
/etc/modprobe.conf for 2.6 kernel.

alias net-pf-10 off

Is this correct or are there any other solution

Vasudevan

Subject: [Ilugc] qparted - partition resizing
Message-ID: <20040715055650.DA83E23C09@ws5-3.us4.outblaze.com>

Hi List

I have a compaq notebook, which comes with 40GB hardisk loaded with win XP home ( it's a single partition c: drive )

Now i want to resize the partion and install other OS.

i defragmented the entire c: drive and then
As some gentleman suggested on this list, i booted from a live knoppix cd and used qparted.

what happens is once i start resizing, so that i get 18GB free space.
It says a error that resizing failed due to wrong shutdown of windows machine etc.

I have retried it many times after again defragmenting, sghutting down windows properly again etc in vain.

Could somebody point me the mistake or suggest alternate soln ?

/Kamban

nobody gives you unlimited

dishnet dsl and touchtel dsl give you 1 gb a month onwards - but at 
pretty steep rates.

1.saw an advt. yesterday in hindu where touchtel has offered "unlimited*" during off peak hours (i think its from 10pm to 5am) for 995Rs/month (and another scheme around 500Rs/month).

I guess by "unlimited*" they mean unlimited downloads. I could see no catches.

2.what about bsnl bfone that gives 'almost' unlimited download.

3.and tata... i heard their offering is not restricted by time/download.

4.donno about cable internet.guess they are available only in selected areas.

using parted on an NTFS partition might not be such a good idea
use partition magic (evaluation version if you'd like from
http://fosi.da.ru/) and then retry

Partition magic would be ideal for NTFS paritions
otherwise if your laptop is a thinkpad then use the IBM tools itself

i believe fosi hosts cracked full versions of windows software rather than eval versions.
if you had known otherwise it is ok.
but if you knew about the nature of the website, i think that it is better that if you had included a disclaimer. cause... anyone who accesses this site from a corporate internet 'may' go for a toss. even otherwise the kind of advt. and images on the site may take the reputation of the unsuspecting person clicking on the link for a roll when people see what is on his monitor.

just thoughts.... if you feel good it is ok. otherwise, pardon me and ignore it.

and one more thing.
suggesting a (cracked) commercial version of the windows software in place of a oss tool, in a lug might not be a good idea. it could be used against us in the future.

moreover, i used the gnu suite of utilities (i forget which) to partition my ntfs partitions and had no problem whatsoever. in fact i found them better than any other windows util i had used so far (including partition magic and system commander).

gnuparted. i think qparted is just a kde frontend for this.

and if that was a compaq you have to watch for small hidden 20 MB 
partitions ... at least with compaq pcs that was the case

I have an old compaq laptop but not tried throwing linux on it yet.

well the poster wanted a safe way out,to split his single 40Gig drive into
multiple drives.  he didnt mention that he wanted to do it the open source
way...and experience tells me that the safest way out would be to do it
using partition magic.......
as I have never got a primary partition resized with any other tool, open
source or not

  Not quite unlimited, it's basically dialup. So one night download
could only bring you about 100 MB downstream data.

  I guess you are talking about that Rs. 1500 per month plan.

  Sify is available is more areas, I think.  BTW, has anyone using it,

HI

in the following screenshots below
if you observe the right hand side of the screen
the user has some sort of an applet through which he monitors battery
usage,weather, hdd usage temperature etc

what is different is the transparent workspace.
I have not seent his in gnome 2.4
this is certainly not gnome-applets

can someone take a look and identify the package ?
is it exclusive to gnome2.6 ?

A lot of people here are asking for it.

GNOME has gdesklets.  Whats cooler about gdesklets is  that it doesn't
not fire up a  hundred daemons unlike KDE apps. So I  run it with pure

You can very well have these three on the same machine.

You should be having a minimum of four partitions for doing this.

A (preferebly) primary partition for Windows
A partition for Linux /
A swap partition for Linux
A primary (mandatory) for FreeBSD

A typical setup will be like this.

/dev/hda1 -> Linux Swap
/dev/hda2 -> NTFS (Windows 2000)
/dev/hda3 -> UFS (FreeBSD) [Mandatory to be primary]
/dev/hda4 -> Extented
/dev/hda5 -> Linux (/)

* First install Windows 2000.
* Next install FreeBSD and tell it not to put anything on the MBR 
instead write only the BR. You need to create a swap slice and a root 
slice inside hda3. Note that you can't use Linux swap.
* Install Linux

Your grub configuration should have something like

title Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional
	rootnoverify (hd0,1)
	makeactive
	chainloader +1

title FreeBSD
	rootnoverify (hd0,2)
	makeactive
	chainloader +1

title GNU/Linux
	root (hd0,4)
	....

HTH.

There is no hard and fast rule to keep Windows on hda2. My idea was to 
have the swap as the first partition so that when swap is at the 
beginning of the disk, the performance is better. If you want to acheive 
that first create the partitions using Linux installation CDROM and then 
start Windows setup (Donot create the partitions from Windows installer)

gdesklets is  the name of the  app you are looking  for.  It basically
sits on your  desktop and does not interfere  with your window manager
(if you have a gnome-compliant window manager OR a window manager that
can be made to ignore certain windows). 

I use debian, so  all I had to do was to  do apt-get install gdesklets
gdesklets-data  and it  was  all there.  But  the painful  part is  in
setting up.  Too long a process  to explain... read the  README in the
the doc/ directory.

That screenshot is cool.  You could add Industrial theme (or better
the ximian-artwork package) to that for an even more cool desktop.

Gentoo users can simply do a 

1. emerge gnome-themes-extras (if not already installed)
2. emerge ximian-artwork
3. emerge openoffice-ximian (if u need ximianized version of OO.org, 200 MB)
4. Edit your gdm.conf to use Industrial gdm theme
5. Edit your /usr/share/cursors/xfree/default to use the `Industrial`
cursor theme.
6. Change your gnome (meta) theme to Industrial

BTW, is there a deb for ximian-artwork?

I dont know what you  are talking about. Is ximian-artwork nothing but
a set of themes? If so, yes.  There are tonnes of themes and such. But
you  need  to  be  running  gnome,  i guess.   Not  something  like  a
standalone window manager.

Hello,
I have enquired SIFY. Rs 600pm is using shared
bandwidth. Download speed expected be 3 to 4 K max(36
to 48 KBitsPS). Also if u pay for 6months in advance
the charge is Rs 3000(Rs 500 pm). It is most likely to
work in linux, because sify uses ethernet card.
Installation charge is about Rs 2000.

The only computer course I ever did in my life was for Programming 
Proficiency in "Windows Based Business Applications", in 1996 under the 
AUDEL program, jointly conducted by Anna University and DC Elcot [near 
the Adayar Signal, just above the Adyar Bata shop].  They also had a 
Unix Course then, and please check if the course is still available. 
 Affordable course fees, ample lab hours, good teaching staff etc are a 
part of the training system there.  I am sure they could also organise a 
training program if requested.

You could also check :
http://www.annauniv.edu/tg/tsour_anna_7.htm
http://www.geocities.com/dclkmkoil/courseoff.htm [the usual course list, 
just to give you the idea.  I could find no links to the AUDEL program]
http://www.ugu.com/   [the last course?]

Ramanraj.

Why  do they mention  GDM, Galeon,  Metacity, etc.,.   individually? I
thought  all  gtk apps  know  how  to read  gtkrc  and  hence use  the
appropriate theme. I've never used a ready made "theme" in a long time
now. All I do is edit ~/.gtkrc.

Hi everybody,
 
Any one could give me solution to solve the problem:
 
I have recently purchased PIV with HT and the board is D865 GBF/D865 GLC. I recently installed PCQuest Linux 2004. The OS did not detect the sound card. The following are the errors it says:
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Informational - artsmessages
               Error while initializing the sound driver:

               The sound server will continue, using the null output device.
               --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Can anybody suggest something.
With regards,
Mannukannan.

  Apart from the GTK+ theme, each app contains there own specific
theme set, which include

* icons, spinners for Galeon, Epiphany, Nautilus
* GDM-theme for GDM
* Metacity window theme for Metacity
* themes for XMMS
* lots of icons and cursors

.. these are different from GTK+ themes which just describe the styles
and engines associated with widgets.

Installing ximian-artwork and friends is enough to get a Ximian
desktop look and feel.

What is your  phone model? at+crm=1 is only if you  own an LG LSP-340E
WLL model. If  you have a reliance handset, its  a different code. But
since  you said you  want on  'serial' port,  I'm assuming  your phone
instrument *IS* LSP340E. Anyway, this might still prove useful:

 Call for Nominations for the 2004 FSF Award for the Advancement
 of Free Software

FSF and the GNU project request nominations for the 2004 FSF Award for
the Advancement of Free Software. We want to give this award to a person
who has made a great contribution to the progress and development of
Free Software (free as in freedom as defined in the Free Software
Definition <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>), through
activities that accord with the spirit of software freedom.

Any kind of activity could be eligible -- writing software, writing
documentation, publishing CDs, even journalism -- but whatever the
activity, we want to recognize long-term central contributions to the
development of the world of software freedom. "Accord with the spirit"
means, for example, that software, manuals or collections of them
(online or on CD) must be entirely Free. Work done commercially is
eligible, but we give this award to individuals, not to companies,
organizations, or teams.

People such as Alan Cox, Miguel de Icaza, Donald Knuth, Larry Lessig,
Brian Paul, Guido van Rossum, Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, and
Larry Wall who have already received this or other awards for their
contributions, are not eligible for the Award for the Advancement of
Free Software. Among those who are eligible, the award committee will
try to choose whoever has made the greatest contribution.

Please send your nominations to <award-nominations@gnu.org>
<mailto:award-nominations@gnu.org>, on or before Sunday 31 October 2004.
Please submit nominations in the following format:

     * Put the name of the person you are nominating in the email message
       subject line.
     * Please include, in the body of your message, an explanation (40
       lines or less) of the work the person has done and why you think
       it is especially important to software freedom.
     * Please state, in the body of your message, where to find the
       materials (e.g., software, manuals, or writing) which your
       nomination is based on.

Information about the previous awards can be found online

I also had the same problem, both in Redhat and Mandrake . Do not use the
rconnect 1.0 tar file. Use the earlier version 0.50. It worked for me .
Version 1.0 did not .

Hi All !
I'm using mdk 10 and I don't have mozilla mail.
How to install it ?
It has a nice spam arresting feature which ximian-evolution does not
have.
Thanks in advance.

I would recommend Thunderbird... It's based on Mozilla Mail, has some 
more features:

http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/releases/

 From the site:

In addition to the feature set found in Mozilla Mail 
<http://www.mozilla.org/mailnews>, Mozilla Thunderbird has several new 
features and improvements to make your mail and new experience better. 
Highlights include:

    * The ability to customize your toolbars
      <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/screenshot.png> the
      way you want them. Choose View / Toolbars / Customize inside any
      window.
    * UI extensions
      <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/specs/extensions.html>
      can be added to Mozilla Thunderbird to customize your experience
      with specific features and enhancements that you need. Support for
      extensions
      <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/specs/extensions.html>.
      Extensions allow you to add features particular to your needs such
      as offline mail support
      <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/specs/offline.html>.
      A full list of available extensions can be found here
      <http://texturizer.net/thunderbird/extensions/>.
    * A new look and feel. Thunderbird also supports a large number of
      downloadable themes
      <http://texturizer.net/thunderbird/themes.html> which alter the
      appearance of the client.
    * An addressing sidebar
      <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/specs/images/abPicker.png>
      for mail compose which makes it easy and convenient to add address
      book contacts to emails.
    * Online help <http://texturizer.net/thunderbird/> includes a FAQ,
      tips and tricks and other useful information.
    * Simplified preferences UI and menus.
    * Footprint and performance improvements.

Cheers,
Vamsee.

gnome 2.6 has  just made its way into  the 'sid' distribution. You can
switch over to 'sid' and do an apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade to
get gnome 2.6 automagically.

Is the module usb-storage loaded?

If so, the output of dmesg tells which device it is assigned to.
You can just mount it as,
# mount DEVICE DIRECTORY

Also ensure that the vfat module is loaded (unless you have created your
own fs in that device).

No problem.  The name 'Linux' is now the business/marketing form of
the name 'GNU/Linux' (as OSS is to FSF) :)

I too expect the name to be changed.

May be in technical sense. But I always respect freedom (for eg. I
won't run Yahoo's messenger, real player, winex, nvidia-drivers, etc
[1] ).  The term GNU/Linux is the pure sense of freedom!  If Hurd is
mature, I may switch completely to GNU!

[1] soon i'm going to switch to X.org

then, I guess  you dont use google search[1], GIF  images and use MP3s
as  well.  I'm glad  if you  live clean.   I dont,  anymore.  non-free
software isn't as threatening as illiteracy and other evils. But thats
just   my  thoughts.   feel   free  to   keep  your   sentiments  with
yourself. ILUGC is here to help people. Lets do that.

  Oh! I see.  There are significant exceptions :( For GIF, I won't
explicitly go for that.  Even in our portal[1], we use gif2png to
convert all gifs.  But I have never used `find / -name "*.gif" to
identify the culprits in my filesystem. Regarding MP3, I still use
that (not for ripping)

  BTW, Do you think RMS uses google ?

They are old enough to have been trotted out in many a similar thread so 
far.  So far, no, they haven't helped me "rethink" my opinions.

GRUB is the sexiest boot loader I have ever seen. I think GRUB does all

I know the importance of Linux, GNU and Freedom. But,

Hi everybody,

  I am new to GNU/Linux & new to ILUGC. I have switched from propriate software (Windows) to linux. I want to know more about GNU philosophy, esp. that selling sofware and freely distributing it is O.K.. I went to official GNU web site but there are to many links & reading it online does take up lot of internet charges. So could somebody tell me a site where there is a downloadable version of their philosophy, mission, goals, etc.. so that i can read it off-line , a ftp site probably. I attended the recently held tak by Mr. Anand Babu, it was wondefull. He mentioned about a book about hackers culture ( something like Hackers ...) could somebody tell me the exact name of it.

Thanks,

                                                                                       --Ashwin.K

We can atleast make the newbies coming to ilugc not taken away by the
fact that Linux is everything (otherwise they would know atleast there
is something like GNU exists)

PS: I will be happy whatever the name is :)

hotmail does  not provide a standard  pop/imap for its  free users. So
you cannot read your hotmail  mails from evolution.  It has a 'webdav'
feature by which  outlook express users can get the  file. There WAS a
project called  'gotmail' that fetches the mail  (through webDAV?) and
delivers  it to your  MTA. I'm  not sure  what is  the status  of this
project at  this moment,  though I see  that the 'gotmail'  package on
debian is pretty recent.

Sridhar said he wouldn't use the above said proprietary software, because using them is ethically wrong. 

Patents are different. A patented feature in a software does not in itself, make the software ethically illegitimate. Some companies obtain patents so that they can protect themselves(by cross licensing), from companies whose sole business is to obtain exclusive rights to patents and then threaten to sue. It's OK, if Google adopts the no-first-use-policy. For more information, check out http://gnu.fyxm.net/philosophy/amazon-rms-tim.html

BTW, GIFs are now patent free. http://burnallgifs.org/

When you distribute audio files you might want to use OGG rather than MP3, because there are people on this planet who cannot use free software to play your audio files. And it is NOT ethically wrong to use free MP3 tools to decode or encode MP3 files.

> as  well.  I'm glad  if you  live clean.   I dont,  anymore.  non-free
> software isn't as threatening as illiteracy and other evils. But thats

It is true that non-free software is not the most threatening social evil, but that does not mean that you can under estimate the importance of software freedom. It is not that you find out the top most social evil and then everybody works against it. There are lots of social evils and everyone fighting against each one of them, will have to adopt the best possible method to fight against them. And with respect to software freedom, the free software movement is doing a great job.

We take a lot of things for granted. Do you think the GNU project and the GNU/Linux system would have been possible without a dedication to freedom? Below is an excerpt from "Free as in Freedom": 

"During the late 1980s, when Stallman was putting in 70- and 80-hour work weeks writing the first free software tools and programs for the GNU Project, the pain in Stallman's hands became so unbearable that he had to hire a typist. Today, Stallman relies on a keyboard whose keys require less pressure than a typical computer keyboard."

Stallman's struggle is just one example of the hundreds of freedom fighters in the free software community, who have made software freedom a reality. You can also take Anand Babu for example, the way he fought Apple in the Playfair issue.

If it took this much pain and effort to give software users freedom, it will take even more to maintain it. With SCO, Microsoft, Apple and others increasingly attacking our community, the awareness of software freedom and the ability to resist the temptation to use non-free software is becoming more and more important. If we don't talk about freedom, we will lose it even before we realise it.

You can check out the book "Free Software, Free Society - Selected Essays of Richard Stallman", which is available from http://notabug.com/2002/rms-essays.pdf . The GLUG-T sells printed copies of the book, check out http://glugt.linuxisle.com/store.shtml

Hi,

I think Mr.Anand Babu was quite clear on this issue. All these
developers develop such good software and all you can give back to them
is credit. And if people feel that they could compromize others creidt
as per their convinence, i think it is morally wrong.

OK. Please feel free to rename India as Gandhi/India then.

After all, you don't want to compromise Mahatma Gandhi's credit, do you?

LUSTRE -- Linux Usability , testing, review and evaluation
A new group for reflecting on the finer aspects of Linux acceptability

Let us face it. Linux is a great thing in the field of computers. Yet,
we have a whole lot of things in Linux which are outright shabby in
usability. They may be technically sound and lovely, yet they ignore
some very simple expectations of the users. Thats why we still meet
people who feel overwhelmed by the very idea of using Linux in their
daily life. Even Linux gurus and wizards fumble at times. There is so
much to do and so much we can do, to make Linux more lovable by
everybody.

Join this new line of thinking on Linux. Be a part of the
fun. Let us join hands and introspect.

To join, just send me a mail expressing your interest in this subject.

  The name is a little overloaded - LUSTRE is also a high-performance

throwFunc does not ``throw'' any exception as you expect it to. C++
exceptions are different from processor exceptions. x/y raises a
division by zero exception. You should instead have

if (y == 0) {
    throw EXCEPTION;
}

What is the best way to install and manage applications without root. Is
there way to install all apps under some path say /usrinstalled ?
The main requirement is management of installed software. Can portage be
used? I hope my question is clear.

Message-ID: <39013d43900536.390053639013d4@vsnl.net>

Talk    : Taste the THUNDER

Speaker : Mr Anand Babu <ab@gnu.org.in>,
          VP CDC, USA & Member, FSF-I.

Date    : Sat Jul 17 17:00 IST 2004
Venue   : ADI-TeNeT Seminar Hall, CSD 320, ESB, IIT-Madras.

The  super-computer code  named  THUNDER was  built  was for  Lawrence
Livermore  National Labs  (http://www.llnl.gov) by  California Digital
Corporation, USA. It has 4096  Itanium2 64 bit Processors, 8TB of RAM,
Quadrics Interconnect and runs GNU/Linux. Code named "Thunder", with a
performance of  20 trillion floating  point operations per  second, it
has been ranked second in the  TOP500 list of the worlds most powerful
supercomputers    maintained   at   http://www.top500.org/list/2004/06
Anand Babu,  a  full-time  free software developer is a core developer
behind THUNDER, who ensured that all the software he wrote for Thunder
was released under GNU GPL.

At the ILUGC  Linux Install Festival 2004, celebrated  last weekend, I
proposed that we  invite Anand Babu, who happened to  be in India, and
Bharathi quickly had  a word with Raman, and it  was decided to invite
AB for a talk on THUNDER.

Bharathi then announced  about the talk on THUNDER by  AB in the ILUGC
mailing   list,  incidentally   also  asking   for  help   to  arrange
transportation, and as I had been in touch with AB for quite some time
now, over legal  issues connected with the Hymn project,  and AB and I
were anyway due to meet, I happily offered to take the role of playing
host.

AB travelled all the way from Salem by road, along with his friend CB,
so that we  could hear his THUNDER from close quarters.   AB was at my
residence around  13:00 Hours as promised  and I was  thrilled to meet
AB, who  was full of  vim and vigour,  sporting a disarming  grin, and
within the first few moments I knew that he drew considerable strength
and power from free software  philosophy.  Many think of free software
philosophy  in   abstract  terms,   rather  than  simply   living  it.
Philosophy  is merely  an  attitude that  guides  one's behaviour  and
performance.  A  lot could  be achieved with  this clarity and  all of
AB's contributions  to projects that include working  on Thunder, Hymn
and Hurd  stand testimony to the  often requested proof  of utility of
free software philosophy.

Bharathi soon joined our discussion  and we had a lively discussion on
free software, and  the active part we could play.  On  our way to the
venue, we discussed  about taking this high technology  to everyone in
meaningful  ways.    Bharathi  gave  interesting   insights  into  the
translation work in progress under Zha Linux Project: the mouse is not
'eli' - but  'chutti'! Click is translated as  'sodukki'. Soon we were
at the usual meeting venue for the ILUGC.

AB was  briefly introduced,  and immediately, AB  started the  talk on
THUNDER with a  torrent of information about the  harware and firmware
that make up the THUNDER  super-computer, which is in fact an assembly
of 1000  individual interconnected computers sans  screen, keyboard or
mouse.  Each mother board  has four Itanium2 processors, advanced bmc,
sensors  and each  system  is  connected to  the  other with  Quadrics
interconnect.   Hardware  errors are  handled  with  a  great deal  of
sophistication.  Each of the 1000  serial ports are connected to a hub
called calypso. With FreeIPMI, and  a collection of other tools, it is
possible to configure  even the bios of all the  1000 computers with a
single command or even address a specific machine using its IP address
from a single node.  Essentially, the network is automated, and manual
tasks are minimal  that could be taken care by a  single sys admin, to
whom to the super-computer appears as a single file system.

Though several applications work together to make Thunder possible, it
could  not  possibly  work  without FreeIPMI  -  Intelligent  Platform
Management  System,  which  is  a programmable/extensible  system  for
building intelligent platform management solutions.  FreeIPMI provides
"Remote-Console"   (out-of-band)  and  "System   Management  Software"
(in-band)  based on  Intelligent Platform  Management  Interface (IPMI
v1.5) specification.  This system includes its  own portable userspace
IPMI device drivers  and can be interfaced through  C library, a shell
with      readline       capabilities.       One      could      visit
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/freeipmi/, follow the links, maybe
talk with AB,  to get to building their own cluster  cloud and let the
world hear a loud clap of THUNDER!

FreeIPMI Library (libfreeipmi) the Core of FreeIPMI system consists of
LAN,  KCS,  SMIC,  PCI/SMBIOS  system interface  device  drivers,  all
packaged in  a single portable C library.  Management applications can
access the BMC at various  levels using higher level IPMI command APIs
or raw read/write interface to the driver.

fish,  the  FreeIPMI SHell  provides  a  Shell, Extension/Plug-in  and
scripting  interface which  allows  one to  fish  in troubled  waters,
enabling  access through  a set  of IPMI  commands.  AB  explained how
System Administrators can quickly add features or customize the system
using  the  Extension  interface  in Scheme  language.   For  example,
Pushing System Event Log data to a MySQL server, Triggering alarm upon
Platform  Chassis Intrusion,  Generating email  for  critical platform
events like processor temperature above threshold limit or fan failure
or memory errors.  In fact,  many of the functionalities of this shell
are themselves implemented as Fish extensions.

Fish  also provides  scripting interface  (#!/usr/sbin/fish)  to write
useful   command-line   utilities.   "sensors",   "sel",   "bmc-info",
"bmc-config" are actually Fish scripts.

THUNDER  cost about  US  $25 Million,  but  is nowhere  near the  $350
Million that  appears to have  gone into producing the  Super Computer
that is  approximately twice as  fast as THUNDER.  AB  revealed future
plans to vie for the top rank.

Shivshanker   Chander,  Bharathi   and  few   others   raised  several
interesting questions  on the design  and technology behind  the Super
Computer, and I hope they can give better narration or analysis of its
technical details. About ~30 of  the active ILUGC members attended the
meet.

The talk  then moved on  to Gnu/Hurd.  AB  gave a demo session  of GNU
Hurd, and  soon we saw on  the screen the Debian  GNU/Hurd 0.3 booting
sequence and, to my surprise, the command prompt was waiting, ready to
run bash  commands!  Was not login  necessary before we  could run all
the commands?  Not with Hurd.   Global userspace was accessible to all
and the design  objectives probably have their origins  in the reasons
behind the GNU Project itself.  Free software maximises free access to
computing  resources, and naturally,  we could  expect free  access to
files and commands which are freely available in the global userspace.
AB  explained briefly about  the Hurd  kernel architecture,  Mach, the
concept of translators and took us to the commands showtrans, settrans
etc.  We were taken through the code for the /dev/null translator, and
AB explained how several translators could sit on one top of the other
and make writing of code easier.  But all that could fully be possible
only after  several Hurd components  were in place, and  requested the
programmers present to contribute time  and effort to Hurd, which aims
at a kernel  that is fully scalable and  extensible with no syslimits.
AB steered clear from micro  vs monolithic kernels and focused on what
remains to be done to make Hurd more mature and usable.

AB spoke on the Hymn issue that made international news.  We can never
take  any of  our  computing  rights for  granted,  and defending  the
freedom  and rights  of free  software uses  in the  community,  is an
unending task, and the sacrifice made  by AB to support the world wide
community of free  software users cannot be fanthomed  easily.  I wish
that the recent efforts of  AB, for his active contribution to several
important projects released under the GPL, including THUNDER, Hymn and
Hurd  are recognised,  and particulary,  I wish,  many can  see  AB as
highly deserving the FSF Award for advocating use of free software.

AB  also said  that  free  software developers  earn  more than  their
proprietary  counterparts, mainly  because users  and  developers have
been able to directly  interact, which leaves the meddlesome middleman
out  of the  picture,  who is  forced  to provide  a  real service  to
survive.  AB  requested users  to give credit  to developers  who make
contributions,  and also take  up responsibility  for writing  code in
suitable free software projects.

On our way back, we got a  little personal and asked AB if he has tied
the knot, for which he replied that  he was yet to fall in love! There
was a serious complaint from AB  and CB that there were [no]t e[no]ugh
young women in the free  software community!! Probably there should be
user  groups led  by women,  which I  think is  a good  idea, because,
generally mothers spend more useful time with children, and if many of
our young  ladies could could get  together to chat  on free software,
this may help them to become productive users of computers, and may be
this is also a good way to  pass on the culture to the next generation
more  easily.  AB appeared  to be  happy with  his present  status and
added with a wide grin:

"I am free, free as in Freedom" ;)

Well, the issue is diffrent here. Everybody knows he won freedom for
this country, so isint the case with GNU/Linux. Half the people dont
know what GNU is and what it entitles them to do. Forget all this, they
havent even heard about it. If we dont take the initiative no body will.

AFAIK, this is not possible with portage or even apt.  Installing in
different prefix is not even possible.

Your options are ..

1. use sudo
2. create a wrapper script which runs emerge or apt-get and set the
uid bit on it.
3. Compile from source and use the home prefix scheme
3. give your users the root password ;)

You are really underestimating this - lots of people are perfectly aware 
of GNU and its extensive contributions to the building of linux.  
However, they still feel that this is not a valid reason to "cobrand" 
gnu and linux.

Wow, the best record of the minutes of any ILUGC meeting so
far. Ramanraj had better be careful, or he'll be made the
official records-keeper :-).

I'll second the nomination of AB for the FSF Award. I haven't
seen somebody as idealistic and optimistic as AB for a long
time, while at the same time being a very capable developer
as well as system architect.

He would be in good company if so - the last two awardees were Larry

I wanted to avoid taking sides on this issue, but I have a small point:
it's preferable to be inclusive, and welcome all the *BSD, *IX, etc.
people into the fold, rather than get restrictive. I use the GPL
myself, and I applaud the GNU contributions, but it's simply
more practical to be agnostic in this matter.

This is better served with a LUG moniker rather than a GLUG one. No
point fighting over this - let's move on, and spend our efforts on
finishing off Billy boy. As the great Marcus Cato said, in all his
speeches to the Roman Senate 'Coita Gatego ...', or translated from
the Pig Latin: '(Bill) Gates must be screwed...' :-). Actually, Cato
didn't say this, I'm saying this :-), and poor old Marcus must be
spinning in his grave.

Subject: [Ilugc] Thanks to Xandros! - 4 OSes  a hard disk
Message-ID: <20040719044330.3662023EF6D@ws5-4.us4.outblaze.com>

Hi List / Sanjay

Thanks for your suggestions ( Sanjay's doc definitely helped me )

Over the weekend i was able to install 4 Oses in my hard disk
( Windows XP, FreeBSD 5.2.1, Fedora core -2 and Xandros )

However there is one issue that freebsd does not boot.

I'll describe the steps i followed.

(i) Resized Windows XP to use 10 GB using Xandros OS. ( i.e In the process of installation, there is a step that Xandros will ask us to resize, once this is over i press cancel. So my aim is achieved )

(ii)10GB winXP, 30 GB free
Installed freebsd 5.2.1 successfully by creating a slice of 8GB ( /usr /var everything )
Able to dual boot with WinXP and Freebsd successfully F2 keys )

(iii) Installed FC-2 for another using another 10GB.
Here comes the trouble. GRUB recognised only windows partitition and did not recognise freebsd.
So freebsd is lost at this step. I followed the winXP+freebsd+linux howto and modified the grub.conf.
Still the same result.
So i just restored grub to the original.

(iv) Installed Xantros and the boot loader of xantros also could not recongnise freebsd.
It successfully recognised WinXP, Fedora.

I'am pasting the current lilo.conf and fdisk from xandros which is the bootloader now.

My machine ( laptop ) has only one harddisk (40GB ) and freebsd was installed in /dev/hda2.

Fdisk output

The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 4864.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)

Command (m for help): p

Disk /dev/hda: 40.0 GB, 40007761920 bytes

  Nah, I'm not a Unix old-timer, though I sometimes pretend to be one.
I started playing with computers in 1979, but didn't actually program
in C/Unix until 1987 - it was quite a culture shock to my FORTRAN/Pascal
upbringing. I used Minix for the first time in 1991 (about the same time
as Linus), but didn't see long-term possibilities or any advantages over
the System V derivatives in vogue at the time :-).

I discovered UseNet in 1993 and was fairly active, off and on, until 1998.
I worked with SunOS, IRIX, HPUX, Mach, AIX until about 1998, but I'd
started using Slackware in 1994, and after that I've moved progressively
to Linux on x86. I still have a few RS/6000 portables running AIX, as
mementoes of the earlier era. 

The main killer apps that convinced me to go with Linux were elm & tin,
which were available on the other Unices, but were not as actively
maintained as the ones in the mainstream Linux distros. That, and XAA
on XFree86. Most people probably won't understand that there was
an era when merely resizing or moving a window was a time-consuming
exercise.

If you have asked the BSD installer to write the BR, then

other=/dev/hda2
label=FreeBSD

should boot without any problem.

Using sudo is not an option --- The root might as well install the
packages if needed.

Let me restate my problem a bit more clearly (I hope). The
administrators maintain and support several applications. Users install
whatever software they feel would be useful to themselves and others.
The present practice followed is compiling from sources with a prefix,
and then writing an entry into a file. This system is really messy.
Is there a way to manage this?

I don't understand yout problem in using 'sudo'. Once you configure 
'sudoers' correctly, this can be either done by the users or root. Have 
to tried 'sudo'? If not it worth a try.

Won't the sytem really become messy if the users installed whatever they 
want? Installation of a software is a cruicial task and it should be 
done only by the right persons. You can have multiple admins (using 'sudo').

In /etc/inittab file do the following

below this line   id:3:initdefault:

Add this line
~~:S:wait:/sbin/nologin
This will prompt for root password even when booting into single user mode


Or add a lilo or  grub password to prevent going into single user mode

Is your system slow if you use console terminal
(F1-F6) with your ethernet cards on/active?

Are you running any servers?

Check which process is using a lot of CPU from the
output of "top":

$top

You can check the processes running from the output of
"ps"

$ps -aux

I have used sudo. sudo does not help here. Do you mean to say, use "sudo
apt-get install PACKAGE"?  Sending an e-mail to the admin would do and
they would install that package. The problem is, when different people
need different versions of the software, the package management system
does not provide for that.

The problem is not about authentication.

Yes. There are multiple admins, who properly install, support software
and harware installations. However they do cannot support all software
requested by the users. There are numerous window managers, editors,
browsers, compilers, ... And they have to support different versions of
each software. Also they are not obliged to support all software, for
example media players. This is not feasible.

The solution they have provided is to have a directory under which
people install whatever software they want -- which is not officially
provided. The current setup, as I have stated above, is compiling from
source, with a prefix. Management becomes a real problem and the system
gets messy, but this is unofficial. I am searching for a way to manage
this setup in a clean way. I hoped that using portage we could specify a
prefix, or do something of that sort.

Does anyone have a solution?

Most newbies to GNU/Linux think that GNU/Linux is a M$ killer.  The
idea of GNU/Linux, *BSDs and/or other free operating systems is that
people can choose a better alternative.  And never was the intention
of killing BillG or M$ for that matter.  It may be a side effect
though.

People should be given a choice.  IMO if you say all the computers
should be installed/pre-loaded with RedHat/Mandrake, you're once again
starting a monopoly.

The solution is that users have individual directories for installing
packages under their own.  You can use GNU Stow for this.  This is IMO
far more better than most of the package managers out there and very
simple to install and use.

Users will have their own stow dirs and switching between various
versions is simple as a breeze.

  Probably they mean't to say (if at all) that all computers should
run only on free software which is actually against monopoly. (NOTE:
Free Software is a general term)

Hi all,

I recently switched to X.org ... just 2 commands (compiled from src)

 $ emerge -C xfree
 $ emerge xorg-x11

Is there any binary incompatability with both the X servers?  What do
you think about X.org's X server?  Any thoughts?

Assuming that you are asking about Linux compatibility
No major Issues whatsoever. 
However You might face some problems in the power management side

Hi,

I am interested in reading the book
"Design and implemenation of freebsd"
(4.3 or 4.4 or later).

I looked for the book in net. The price
is in US dollars(more than 3000 Rs).If
any body knows the low priced edition or
Eastern economy edition of the same book,
Please let me know, I will buy that.

I am very much in need of the book to read.

I have a Compaq presario R3000 laptop with Fedora core-II. The main problem
is with the X-server which most of the time the whole system crashes hangs
when I switch form X to console mode or try to come out from X-windows. The
main problem is that I could not find any bad entries the log file as the
disk activity stops and I need to restart the system.

But it works fine with the live linux CDs of knoppix or SuSe.

Does anyone have solution for this.

Thanks

Thanks :)  AB's talk on THUNDER was really electrifying - and the 
summary could  pass on some of the current :)

I have so far attended 3 ILUGC meets,  and sent in summaries for two. 
The 1st ILUGC meet I attended, was the Lecture delivered by Brian 
Behlendorf, founder of the Apache Project, but  I missed writing the 
summary because I thought some else would send it in, but none did. 
 Brian's talk was brief but indepth, and he listed rights in an 
interesting way: right to fork and its co-relative, duty not to demand 
etc. and I sometimes miss the record of that  speech.  I still hope 
Venki or some one could arrange for the slides that Brian used to make 
his points. Ever since, I thought it is better to err on the excessive 
side of caution :)  Of course, Brian talked about "OpenSource" 
philosophy, and, some of us prefer using plain old "Free Software" 
without the extra wrappers, but that could never come in our way of 
enjoying the excellent talk by one of the leaders of OpenSource :)

>Ramanraj had better be careful, or he'll be made the
>official records-keeper :-).
>
Actually I have been writing an official record-keeping program .^. 
Calpp, that should minimise the effort involved in keeping the records. 
 Calpp is released under the GPL, and it will automate record-keeping :) 
Lately, I have been working on the web interface for Calpp, and once 
that is done, it should be ready to receive input,  order the 
information the way we want and generate reports.  Calpp is the acronym 
for Computer Aided Legal Procedures and Proceedings, and when I did 
write to RMS about Calpp, he replied that it was an AI program I was 
trying to do, and  that the computing field has been struggling with the 
problem for the past over 35 years.  Though I was interested only in 
finding ways to use computers to aid in storing [legal] procedures and 
conducting them as proceedings, it soon became apparent to me that AI 
would not move forward without help from the Law.  We could put Calpp to 
mundane use, but it could also fly high with AI .^.

One thing I know for sure is that Calpp will write well before it can 
start reading, just like any child.

One may never be sure if _I_ wrote it or .^. wrote it for me, in the 
meets to come  :)

If Bharathi, Raman and the other ILUGC members have no objections to 
this, we could send the nomination to FSF.

IMO, this is because of the name resolution problem. Try adding your ip and

I don't think that it is a full version of the book. It only has the 
Chapter 2 of the book. It is also available online at 
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/design-44bsd/

Hi,

It is as follows

I searched in google for this, and was told that the option

perl -pi.bak -e 's/findtext/replacetext/g' myinput.txt
will work out.

I tried with that.
Still it does, not work. It just copies the original file
in the name myinput.txt.bak.

If anybody has a solution, please tell me..

Thanks and regards,
carti

I worked around this, using a dirty trick!

I used strdup to create an exact copy of this string (say x) to x2. 
Then, call strtok with x. Now, whenever you get a token, the separator 
would be x2[token - x - 1].

Please tell me if that worked.

Hi.,

I am looking for a high bandwidth internet connection (ability to serve videos) with no limit (time/usage) to be installed at a very remote place (hence wireless) for an ngo. I am googling; but I am looking for someone with experience in similiar setup. What will be your recommendation?

Satellite connections are your best bet I guess - but they are 
horrendously expensive.  Especially if you want to serve streaming media 
(which is a really high bandwidth app)

There are a lot of sponsors with deep pockets. so cost is a lesser issue.
In fact they(ngo) are seriously considering a deal with a provider who has promised very high bandwidth (out of his max of 11 mbps) for a one time fee of Rs 1 lakh and a monthly fee of around 5000Rs for unlimited usage. But this provider seems to have offered using radio to link up to his server in the nearest city.

I am skeptic about going wireless for high bandwidths. I donno whether vsnl would take up the pains to lay a leased line.

Now, You missed the fine prints.
1. 1 Lakh Rs upfront fees.
2. you get to share the 11 Mbps,the total bandwidth of the provider.(atleast that is what i understand.)


And one more thing.... apart from vsnl, i think bharti is the only company that has its own direct lines(submarine or whatever)/network backbone to connect to the rest of the world(i am not getting the exact term here). And other companies buy it from them. So is there any advantage in going to any other provider other than vsnl/bharti/or whomever has a direct line.

It may be contradicting with the subject..ie.wireless;
but i am just trying to get as much info as possible here.

You can easily eat up a bandwidth for INR. 1 lakh in a month or two. I 
am talking about the bandwidth price that other providers offer (like 
Dishnet, Hathway, etc.)

You can use strchr() itself.  It would return you the ptr to the first
occurance of the char in ptr, which you can increment by 1 each time
to get the next occurance.

Also, avoid using strtok(), as it is not thread safe.

If you are writing C++ progs, use strstream.

Quite a lot of other people do have submarine cable access (vsnl and 
dishnet is now part of vsnl have access to flag and sea-me-we-3 plus 
another cable from singtel, bharti has one from singtel ...)

But at least some other players in the market (such as reliance 
infocomm) do have substantial international bandwidth available.

Concentrate on the big few ISPs (satyam, net4india, bharti etc) - and 
whatever deal you do get, insist on

1. Knowing the QoS limits you get
2. Port sharing ratio - 1:4? 1:2? 1:1?

Look for good service as well.

Suppose you have a leased line ... 1:4 means that upto 4 people can 
share it - in any case you are guaranteed up to a quarter of the leased 
line's capacity.

In the manual page of strtok and strsep function they
have told that It is having some Bug. So we can write
our own parser function. Because if you use any of
these function in any live projects you are involving
in some risky situation in future. I think in many
opensource projects also they might use all the string
function except strtok and strsep It is my experience
please take care.. If you want parser function like
strtok U contact me I can give U that...

Add "init=/bin/bash" to the command line of the boot loader (LILO or 
GRUB). You will be dropped into bash (shell). Type 'passwd'. It will 
prompt for the new password. Enter a password and remember it ;-)

  It wasn't the original intent, but after the SCO affair and
loads of FUD emanating from Redmond about OSS, it is 
now fair game to target Micros~1. In any event, the killer
app was never the GNU/Linux OS, but the apps that it enabled,
like Samba, Apache, OpenOffice, Mozilla etc. 

  The nice thing is that most of the killer apps are platform-
agnostic, and will happily run on any *BSD or *IX. They benefit
everybody in the POSIX ecosystem, and sometimes even the MS
ecosystem.

  MS has got to hate Samba, in particular. There isn't anything
else that is so directly aimed at their core franchise as Samba.

  Another company that must be seeing OSS on the Radar, though not
as a major threat yet, is Cisco Systems. Netfilter/IPTables and Zebra
must be a little worrying to them.

Funny fact - cisco owns linksys, which makes cheap (sub $100) home 
broadband routers and wireless access points.  Linksys firmwares are 
typically linux on a ARM chip, and this firmware is open source (so you 
get a whole lot of third party firmwares for their wrt54g wireless AP + 
broadband router, for example).

Assimilation should be fair and good enough :) 

Imagine the following events:

+GPL'ed MS GNU/Linux (A good attempt  to serve and survive)

+GPL'ed MS * (The community gets a chance to fix all the bugs, if some
 volunteers seriously think that possible)

+Irate MS user$  get wise, start making comparisons with *BSD or *I*X,
 raise  serious questions regarding  the weak  security, vulnerability
 and other bugs  and blotches, join together, revoke  licenses and sue
 for  return   of  license  fee$   along  with  damage$   after  which
 assimilation follows

My prediction is that the last  event is more likely to come true than
the other two :)  HTH

Note: The $ usually found in MS has been transferred to user$ :)

When mounting, you can specify options like the owner or group that

  Actually, Linksys developed the WRT54G around the Broadcom 802.11g
reference platform long before it was bought by Cisco. The Broadcom
platform is based on Linux on a MIPS core, with a few wired and wireless
MACs added. The Broadcom Linux driver for the wireless MAC is still
closed-source, which has been the subject of a lot of debate on the
WRT54G forums - even Alan Cox has weighed in on the subject.

  Anyway, it is possible to build a replacement userland and most
of the kernel for the Linksys WRT54G with enhanced functionality,
including traffic-shaping, QoS, etc., from the source that Linksys
has released - so that's good enough for me.

  It remains to be seen if Cisco will remain OSS-friendly in the
next generation of the Linksys routers. It may well be that they'll
seek to move IOS into the entry-level systems also, which will be
bad for Linux wireless enthusiasts, but may actually offer
benefits to Cisco's business customers.

  However, there are many other routers built around the Broadcom
platform, including offerings from Asus, Belkin, Netgear, etc., so
we should be OK even if Cisco/Linksys drops the WRT54G.

Touctel DSL is offering free surfing during 10 pm to 8 am for

month. This offer is valid till 31st of Jul. Please look at 
http://www.chennaionline.com/science/Technology/07touchtel.asp

I think 10 hrs at 128 kbps, you can do a lot of things. Would be a good 
offer if as genuine as it claims.

I am not sure whethere any trap in the plan. If someone have better idea 
about this, please let us all know.

My console reported that "hda lost interrupt".  I thereafter had to 
reboot, and in the middle of the boot sequence, the error was again 
reported, ending in a kernel panic. When this happened AB was around, 
and something like mke2fs -S /dev/hdb3 fixed the hdb3 partition that was 
corrupt.

How serious is a "lost interrupt" error?  Should I enforce the warranty 
on my HDD?

Zyxel uses Alcatel DSL chipsets ( which is also used by speedtouch modems )
So use a speedtouch linux driver + rfc1483 / pppoa / pppoe ( whatever the ISP supports )
be careful to change the vid /pid as usb drivers use the vid /pid to enumerate the attached usb device

No problemo even if they give some XYZ modem and it is not supported

  It depends - a lot of things can cause this:

1) A flaky IDE connector/cable, especially of the 80-core ATA66/100/133
variety.

2) An overheating HDD. Check if your HDD is an IBM Deskstar aka 'DeathStar',
which had a high failure rate from a variety of design defects.

3) An overheating CPU/motherboard. Check the capacitors on any motherboard
more recent than the year 2000.

4) Bad RAM.

5) A failing SMPS.

I am not sure if I can rule out any of them.  My HDD is a 40GB Seagate 
Barracuda, with warranty cover available for another year. I guess HDD 
alone can't be blamed for the time being, until I get to the cause.

What would be the simplest way to make a backup of recent files without 
duplicating earlier backups on a cd?  That looks like the only real 
insurance and warranty for such systems.

Thanks,

  So do u say that their modems works under Linux? FYI, their new

  Do a Google search for 'rsync crontab snapshot backup' or similar; there
is a how-to somewhere on the web that describes how to set up rsync for
unattended incremental backups, either to another local hard disk or
to another system on the network, without any manual intervention.
You will need approximately 2x hard disk space for the backup snapshots,
regardless of the number of rotating snapshots (hourly, daily, weekly, ...)
that you want to maintain (this is diff/xdelta magic).

  I sometimes do this with 2 local hard disks: An active boot/root disk
(/dev/hda) and another exclusively for the backup snapshots (/dev/hdb).
The 2nd hard disk is twice the size of the directory tree that needs to
be backed up (usually only /home/..., but there's no real limitation).

Yes I know, the flashtux drivers work for the old model that touchtel
used to provide once, but not with the new one, they are giving
nowadays.

Many people are, hence not able to use their USB modems in Linux.

I am having a Sendmail mail server running thru VSNLconnection. But I have my clients on another Internet line (touchtel) thru a Linuxgateway. Both the gateway and mail server are at our office. All my clients useOutlook Exp for mails. My problem is when my clients check their mails, themails need to go to touchtel and then reach VSNL and then to my mail server andthen back to the client. 

As both the server is on the same LAN, is there any way toroute the mails locally rather than to go globally. Since this takes long timeto receive mails.

 

Plz explain me.

Run a local smtp server for outgoing purposes, and set a mailertable to 
route mail for your domain, sent through the outgoing server, to your 
incoming mailserver's LAN IP

rsync is a real luxury.  Thanks a lot! I found the document at 
http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LGNET/current/odonovan.html useful in setting up 
my automatic backup.
Looks like it may take a life time to even get to know about all the 
goodies that lie under the hood :)

Hi All,

This question might seem rather naive.

Are closed source software automatically immune from IPR violations?

Just because the Linux kernel source was available to all, could SCO 
start IP violation suits.

For eg..
How do we know if VC++ has not lifted code from gcc?

(For that matter any closed source software has not lifted code from 
their Open Source counterparts thereby violating licences)

I'm  sure there are  LOTS of  software companies  that lift  code from
GPLed apps  and use it  in their non-GPL  apps.  I guess  yeah, closed
source software  is immune. But  they also have the  disadvantage that
their  software isn't going  to evolve  as quickly  as an  open source
counterpart unless  they invest enough  man power into it  (of course,
I'm  not taking  niche areas  into  account.  I'm  talking about  some
standard network  app). While Yahoo!  Messenger for  unix continues to
suck, Gaim  rocks. (its a  different thing that Yahoo!   Messenger for
Windows beats gaim any day).

Hi,

What is your hardware platform? what kind of embedded linux your are referring?
If its uClinux, may be I can give some suggestions.

>      should i use .

When you compile linux, you will get a ELF file as an output, In order to execute
that elf file, you need an ELF loader. During the initial stages of development,
you can use some emulators, or JTAG debugger to load the image to the target.
If you want to flash the Image, you need to convert ELF for into binary format.

Since your questions are too generic, I am forced to give a generic answer.

No, they are not immune.  Software licenses are covered by Copyright

SCO, or its predecessors in title themselves have released the source 
code under the GPL and, claims about "violations" are as funny as Santa 
Claus [! Original :)] running after the gifts he gave away last 
Christmas :)

If a proprietary company has lifted code from a GPL'ed program, and 
redistributes binaries in violation of the GPL,  the author of the 
GPL'ed program could claim copyright infringement, and the source code 
could be summoned in appropriate proceedings.  At present, disclosure of 
source code for computer programs is not mandatory, and when that is 
done, the problem would cease.

This happened in 2001 I think in India - 
http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/01/02/1540205

An outfit called DSF Internet (based in New Delhi) ripped off the 
everybuddy source code and ported it to windows, calling it 
"MessengerA2Z".  Just that

* They didnt acknowledge everybuddy anywhere in their release

* They did an imperfect job of running sed to convert everybuddy to 
messengera2z

* They marketed this IM client messengera2z to several ISPs.

Everybuddy sued them, and a lot of the ISPs that had paid fat fees to 
license messengera2z dropped it.

	Thank You Sir. Let me explain what I did, my network
is 172.30.1.0
the gateway server is assigned with 172.30.1.1, the
mail server has a LAN
interface and I assigned 172.30.1.2 to it. This is my
setup. 
	On my clients, Outlook I changed the SMTP (sending)
ip to
172.30.1.2, this worked, but for POP3 (receiving)
172.30.1.2 IP didn't
worked. So I have to change the POP3 IP back to the
global IP. So what
happens is, sending mails are fast, but receiving
mails is slow as it has to
travel the 2 networks (Touchtel --> VSNL).

Solutions plz!

I know they are *ideally* not immune.

But my question (rephrased) is
How do I check if a particular closed source software has lifted code 
infringing licenses? Do we have a regulatory body to ascertain that they 
have not violated licenses?

Should'nt there be one because the closed source strategy is providing 
them *virtual* immunity from being tried for Copyright violations?

It is upto the authors of computer programs to enforce their rights.
AFAIK, it is difficult to judge copyright infringement from mere 
binaries, unless it is a byte for byte binary copy, it which case there 
is no need to look into sources to conclude copyright infringement.  But 
if the source code has not been disclosed, then it would have to be 
summoned, and if there is a failure to produce it, in most jurisdictions 
an "adverse inference" would be drawn against the person so refusing to 
produce.

Simply running "strings" on the binary, or inspecting it with a hex 
editor, should give some more information.

GNU is not necessarily tied/limited to Linux. And I don't see any reason
why we need to co-brand GNU & Linux. GNU is a larger entity that can
very well exist on its own. Infact, if you want people to know about GNU
then tell them about GNU.  Even M$ users can use GNU tools. For
example emacs, cygwin . And, I feel this can also be one way to introduce
users to Linux, (via GNU). Show them what GNU tools can do for them, then
tell them how they can get more out of it if they move to Linux. Even
the transition becomes smoother.

Hi vivek,

Did you bother to google. Or else kindly give us one simple reason as to why should we bother to.

If you had... please specify your understanding and state your doubts specifically.

Dont take me wrong pal. But LUGs are not wrappers for google.

(This may be one of the oft repeated mesgs. But neither of us (seeker nor  will see an end to it...)

If you had googled, and I am getting you all cranked up, please forgive me for my indigestion and let it be over with.

I once had the same question. Googling and searching the lug archives brought out a solution.

just my thoughts.....

Probably it would be the work of experts to reason and tell if a work 
has been copied or not.

I tried editing line 12 of the binary of hello, and running it:

Hello, world!: virtual memory exhausted    # Hello, world!   (works)
Hullo, earth!: virtual memory exhausted    # Hullo, earth!   (works)
Hello, kannan, ramanraj, and srs!: virtual memory exhausted   # BUG IN 
DYNAMIC LINKER ld.so: dynamic-link.h: 57: elf_get_dynamic_info: 
Assertion `! "bad dynamic tag"' failed!

I tried  changing the  text on line  5 of  the binary of  GNU computer
program hello from Gnu to Gnu/Linux and ran hello, but the above error
was again generated and the program failed to run :)

BTW, that looks like stuff  for an orginal new sig srs could use :)

Removing as much as a caret ^ caused Segmentation fault.

I guess there  there nothing much we can do  with just binaries, apart
from trivial text or other kinds of manupulations that could be easily
known.   In most  cases  where the  author  releases _only_  binaries,
unauthorised  copying of  the binaries  in toto  or with  minor string
changes may be the main basis for the claim.

But in case of GPL'ed  or other software released under like licenses,
along with  the source  code, a lot  more is possible.   Simply, dummy
lines of code  could be added to distort the binary,  and make it look
`original'.  Where the author  strongly suspects violation of the GPL,
summoning the  source code  may be the  best way  to get to  the truth
easily.  There is atleast one case that involved a Japanese Networking
company that  violated the GPL, that  ended in a  settlement, with the
violator agreeing  to make  a substantial contribution  to FSF-Europe.

http://lwn.net/Articles/73848/
http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-5198117.html

Therefore, being alert about violations could help :)

Note:  In my two earlier posts I inadvertantly included some chars from 
the hello binary that was interpreted by mozilla differently, and the 
rest of the message was snipped ;)

Dear Anandh,
 
             Before asking this kind of questions , u should specify about your mail server either it is Sendmail or Qmail. In send mail Its not a easy task to configure your mailserver to contact two different networks.
Instead of  Qmail there is easy to configure to do like this.I hope u r using Qmail.Your setup is correct. but in outlook express u hav to change the sever type as IMAP.you can try this. it is as fast as smtp and pop3. please try this and send me the result.

Thank You Sir. Let me explain what I did, my network

the gateway server is assigned with 172.30.1.1, the
mail server has a LAN
interface and I assigned 172.30.1.2 to it. This is my
setup. 
On my clients, Outlook I changed the SMTP (sending)
ip to
172.30.1.2, this worked, but for POP3 (receiving)
172.30.1.2 IP didn't
worked. So I have to change the POP3 IP back to the
global IP. So what
happens is, sending mails are fast, but receiving
mails is slow as it has to
travel the 2 networks (Touchtel --> VSNL).

Solutions plz!

This is a issue with your pop3 daemon, not with sendmail or qmail, which are
mailservers, for sending and receiving mail using the smtp protocol.

What are you running as a pop3 server - is it out of inetd / xinetd? Or as a
daemon (like courier imap)?

Try this from your lan -

$ telnet 172.30.1.2 110

$ telnet your.public.ip 110

each time, after you get a prompt like +OK [some text], type "quit" [enter]
and come out of there.

* Check that your pop3 daemon is listening on both interfaces

* Check that there's no firewall preventing pop3 access on your local ip

* Check whether this is not "prevented access" but a timeout because of
reverse dns resolution issues within your LAN, or maybe because of identd
lookups.

Hi,

I installed RH9.0 in a system yesterday with Lilo as boot loader. The other
O/S is Win-98. They both were working fine. Suddenly today when booting it
is not going to the Lilo prompt but it shows the command prompt

grub>

I'm not able to boot any of the OSes. Can you please suggest what could be
the problem?

Thanks,

Hello All

I don't know whether this is a correct place to put this.
But I searched the web and i could not find any good place that discusses BSD unix in chennai.
( Just like ilugc )

i have tried to take one in this direction to start a yahoo group that discusses BSD related issues.
Since i thought ilugc already has somepeople who are inmterested to discuss BSD, this will be the right place to publisize this.

This group discusses general issues ( but not limited to ) like programming , kernel, installation in all bsd variants such as freebsd, netbsd, openbsd darwin etc.

It will also discusses using applications over bsd  

Group Email Addresses

Hope more ilugc members will join this list

few with @freebsd.org addresses) but practically zero traffic.

It's true that a list exists like that, but for some strange reason it is not active and almost 0 traffic.
moreover it's not specific to chennai.

I don't think it is correct to call any BSD as BSD Unix? Any comments?

Indeed BSD cannot be called as BSD Unix, I just wrote like that beacuse it is complete rewrite of the original Unix.
and all over the world, techies agree that BSD is a true unix unlike linux which is a cloned version of unix.

If you are not finding enough traffic on a list that has members from 
around india, yuo are not going to find any more traffic than that on a

Indeed you are right logically, but I'am intending to make chennai as the bsd capital of India
Some steps are
(i)   Sending periodic general news on bsd.
(ii)  Info about bsd happening in India
(iii) bsd tutorials. etc
(iv)  bsd meetings ( depends upon the interest of other members )

Lets see how far this goes.
I only request those who are interested to join this list

Someone might have played with grub (which is another boot loader) before
the last reboot. You may try loading the kernel from the grub boot prompt

kernel /boot/vmlinz-xxxx
initrd /boot/initrd-xxxx
boot

replace xxxx with appropriate strings of the actual filename. TAB will show
you the possible filename completion and help will give more information.

This has been discussed earlier many times.
May be you should actually call it  
FSF/X/GNOME/KDE/OpenOffice/Mozilla/SourceForge/.../RMS/Linus/Linux.
Well, should everyone and every community involved be thanked.
Surely, we can't leave out X, GNOME, et.al. ppl who made the whole

   Highly unlikely, at least for the earlier machines before the IBM
acquisition of Sequent. Those ran a System V derivative called Dynix.
The IBM Netfinity SMP machines will run Linux, but I believe they have
specially-patched kernels and additional drivers.

  Similarly I can't accept the other way--calling the system just
"Linux", when it refers to the kernel alone.

Hello,

I have a delegate proxy serving my LAN clients for HTTP and FTP access. 
I currently use the Mozilla mail client for IMAP access to my mail 
server which sits on the net. Configuring Mozilla to the proxy also 
allows my mail client to access my mails through the proxy.

But I would prefer to use Ximian - can somebody tell me if it is 
workable. What I found on the net was the it is possible to access 
weather using the proxy, but there is no mention of mails.

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [Ilugc] RedHat, Fedora policies, freedom
Message-ID: <41025E2A.9030102@myrealbox.com>

Hello! Although I am fairly new to Linux, GNU etc., I have read quite 
often in the past that RedHat is seen as the "Microsoft" of the Linux 
world. I don't exactly know why, but I guess the reason would be that 
their technologies and policies would make users depend on RedHat 
products only, leaving little room for freedom of choice etc. Is this 
the case?

But now, RedHat Linux has now become the Fedora project, and from what I 
understand from the FAQs, this is a community project sponsored by 
RedHat. Does this mean that RedHat is really showing its commitment to 
freedom and taking the community into confidence, or is this only a gimmick?

Although all this doesn't affect me in any way, I thought it would be 
interesting to know about this from people having a better insight into 
the policies of various distributions.

Thank you.

Fedora is meant as testing ground for new technologies which would
then be incorporated into RH Enterprise Linux. Fedora is still
maintained by Redhat engineers, although it has (supposedly) greater
community involvement.

The following link has a humorous take on the community involvement
aspect of Fedora. Do read it :-)

Well, I guess a little /. won't hurt!

But what I meant to ask was, are the fears (or were the fears) that Red
Hat was doing a Microsoft for real or were they far-fetched claims?

Nice article! But I didn't guess it'd be that bad, when it comes to Red
Hat taking the community into confidence!

As far as I can say, I don't think RedHat can become the next
Microsoft.  First RedHat can't do such dirty tricks that MS was (and
is) doing.  Next that RedHat won't get community support if it's about
to act like Microsoft--RedHat, then will have to handle the situtation
without any help from outside their corporate.  And don't forget the
GPL.

In  "Gandhi  the Man",  Eknath  Easwaran  has  narrated the  following
incident:

<quote>
Gandhi was in jail again when  the British decided to convene a "round
table conference"  to decide India's  fate. India's "representatives,"
invited by British crown officials, were maharajas and politicians who
were  largely supported  by  the strength  of  British rule.  Gandhi's
American  missionary friend  Stanley  Jones used  to  tell with  great
amusement how  he was asked  by Lord Irwin,  the Viceroy of  India, if
Gandhi should  be invited too.  "Gandhi is India." Jones  replied. "If
you invite him,  you invite India. If you do not,  no matter whom else
you  do  invite, all  India  will be  absent."  Lord  Irwin, a  little
embarrassed, served Gandhi His Majesty's invitation in the cell at His
Majesty's Yervada Prison. [1]
</quote>

Gandhi is India whereas GNU and Linux are not the same.    

The software freedom struggle has a parallel with the freedom struggle
India faced  and succeeded,  and now  we can afford  to take  much for
granted.  In the past archives that Suraj pointed to, Prabhu, our List
Admin, has objected  to the copyleft clauses in the  GPL.  Even for us
in   India,  achieving  Independence   never  meant   freedom  without
restrictions.   Many  of  our  freedoms  that are  guaranteed  by  our
Constitution are not absolute  but qualified with restrictions to make
the freedoms meaningfully available for all.  The restrictions imposed
by the  GPL are there only  to guarantee freedom to  the free software
community, and  can hardly be  seen as restrictions in  isolation, but
has  to be read  in the  light of  its objects.   Practically, FreeBSD
developers,  use gcc  and  other  tools released  under  the GPL,  and
generally have no  serious differences with FSF or  the GPL.  Some use
the  GPL and  others use  the BSD  License, or  release all  rights by
placing their works  under the public domain, as  a matter of personal
choice.  FSF  advocates use of GPL  over the other  licenses to ensure
that the modifications also remain free.

ILUGC freely discusses free  software issues, that includes work under
the  GNU, Linux,  BSD and  other free  software projects.   "Linux" is
compiled with  gcc, released under the  GPL, uses several  GNU and BSD
tools,  and  at  best  ILUGC  is  a  neat  label  that  identifes  and
distinguishes this  group from  other such Gnu/Linux  groups.

NIC has recently launched its new portal using plone for adopting free
and  open standards  and  software: http://osf.nic.in/  Some see  such
events as a success for  "Open Source" and defeat for "Free Software".
 From a strictly legal point of view, "free" is the only adjective that
can  correctly  qualify  a  software  license where  under  an  author
releases  his rights.  I thought  "free software"  could be  used more
freely, without being or feeling tied to the Free Software Foundation.

I have proposed  a name change, that of  "Free Software Foundation" to
"FSF", so  that the  generic expression "free  software" would  not be
associated  or  branded  exclusively  with  FSF or  the  GNU  project.
http://mm.gnu.org.in/pipermail/fsf-friends/2004-July/002196.html

That is the only name change I wish would come true :)

Too many acronyms, but Rishab Aiyer Ghosh and others have successfully

I dont  understand.  "use" is  a loose term.   For that matter  my own
organisation uses  gcc heavily just because  "its a great  tool and it
works.".  Has  nothing to  do with the  philosophy.  Infact  there are
serious differences  between the organisation's ideals and  the FSF or
the  GPL. Do  people ("ethical  people"[?])  have  to credit  FSF just
because they use the tool? Just curious because I might use free tools
for things *completely* irrelevant to software.

There have been some recent (~last 18 months) improvements to rsync that
greatly simplify some the scripts related to rotating backups. Check out
the techniques and scripts in:

http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/

The main idea is that you can have an unlimited number of snapshot
backups using only about 2 times the size of the data that you want to
backup, i.e. it is O(1) in space, regardless of the number of previous
backups that you want to keep. This magic is accomplished by keeping
only the changes, and using hard-links for every file that hasn't changed.
One of the added benefits is that when the data hasn't changed much,
the backup is instantaneous, unlike approaches that use 'cp -al' and
so on (note that incremental backups with rsync are much faster, but
the first or seed backup takes about the same amount of time as
conventional approaches. But the seed backup is performed only once).

This is a classic computer-science pointer-manipulation optimization,
similar to copy-on-write, lazy eval, RCU, etc., that gives enormous
speedups over traditional approaches (think of a Micros~1 tape or
CD backup that may well be a  *million* times slower for the same
amount of data. One of the show-piece examples where open-source
obliterates closed-source). 
 
It's not the last word on the subject, but it gets pretty close. I've
streamlined and generalized the scripts considerably, and have even
managed to squeeze them into an embedded-Linux NAS device, in all of
~200k for the rsync executable and about ~2k for the scripts. I'll
post the scripts after they undergo some more testing, but for now you
can use the scripts in the link above, which should be OK for all versions
of rsync.

If you want the recent fixes, use rsync-2.6.2. In particular, the --link-dest
option of rsync is one of the crucial new features. (There is a Trustix srpm
for 2.6.2 that also rebuilds fine for RedHat, for all the rpm junkies like me).

There is some more to it.  Once you install rconnect script and it works ,
you cannot use the normal BSNL Phone and connect to net. It seems the
rconnect script overwrites the common pppd files. I already posted this
problem sometime back, but there were no answers. Probably the problem did
not seem interesting enough.

  Execute it in a chroot jail as an unprivileged (non-root) user. Better
still, run it in a virtual machine like plex86/vmware with a minimal
userland.

  Running it in VM is not appropriate and possible for my application.
 But how could running chroot jail prevent calling system calls like
signal (by which the program can easily kill processes).

PS: Actually I am trying to write a (python) program that will execute
binaries safely.

  It won't, unless you have a modified libc. But you can prevent it from
having access to a lot of helper applications (including ps, network-
related stuff like ifconfig, nmap, and so on). Not a complete solution,
but useful in some situations.

Message-ID: <20040725131609.09EB5398199@ws5-1.us4.outblaze.com>

Hi all

I recently installed freebsd+linux+windows in my laptop
I have a strange issue in that the login scren in both FreeBSD and linux is only 3/4 the size of the laptop screen.

In other words, The screen is small and does not occupy the 15'' laptopLCP monitor fully.

Why is this ?
When is witch to graphical mode ( FreeBSD Gnome, As well as KDE in Linux ) it occupies the full screen
So the driver is proper.
Could somebody give some suggestion ? 


Note :
In Windows 2k also the screen is small. But once i installed the proper drivers, it is proper.

/Kamban

Thanks for the information.  I really feel more secure with the rsync 
backups of my cvs and other dirs  :)

I was recently talking to Arun, who has downloaded a distro from the 
linuxfromscratch project.  He had this idea about making a live r/w-cd 
from linuxfromscratch, which we can load on any computer with a r/w cd, 
finish our work, and then save the changes back to the r/w-cd.  Probably 
your scripts could be of good use in such a project also.  Arun is into 
mnf. sohpisticated testing tools, and probably both of you could team up 
and do wonders. HTH :)

The expression FLOSS was used in a gloss, and the flaw in FLOSS is 
redundancy. "Free software" is simple, elegant, direct and particularly 
it, ought to be used in legislation or other legal documents. More on 
this was at: 
 www.gnu.org.in/pipermail/fsf-friends/2003-November/001238.html  

Many of the postings at 
www.gnu.org.in/pipermail/fsf-friends/2003-November/thread.html  touching 
upon this matter were written last November, when the South Australia 
bill mandating procurement  of "open source" software in govt. 
departments, using the very terms RMS and FSF have been advocating all 
these years was pending.  I wrote to OSI to promote and use "free 
software" terminology in govt. circles, but it was of no avail, and the 
enactment followed shortly thereafter.  "Free software" will gain 
currency when its elegance can be more widely seen and appreciated.

"Use" is a very general word, and I guess, here, you mean running gcc, 
which is different from copying, modifying or redistributing gcc itself. 
 There is nothing in the GPL to stop a user from churning out 
proprietary software using [meaning, running] GPL'ed software.  

I thought that the free software philosophy was meant to appeal to 
software developers.  Suraj, you are into music, and have you listened 
to the Free Software Song by RMS?  I guess that sums up philosophy and 
advocacy :)

General users generally are a little far away from philosophy.  They are 
more worried if the software could be used on their system, how much the 
distro will cost, whether we can support their problems etc. and most of 
their immediate concerns are usually very far away from philosophy.  But 
once the user starts using free software, matures, and soon starts 
thinking and acting like a developer, which I think will be the rule if 
users get to know their system well, then, they may take in the 
philosophy to become competent developers.

If an organization consciously rejects ideals, we may not be  that 
anxious about their ideals and the actions which follow their thinking. 
Maintenance of good ethical values is the _only_ security available, and 
 much of the free software philosophy is as old as the hills, atleast in 
India.

Credit could be gracefully given without waiting for the authors to ask

Of course, software is not written so that we can write more software 
with it, but to meet some real human needs  :)

Are you sure you want a full fledged service? For a key-logging
program, wouldn't it be enough to just start it with an entry in
/etc/rc.d/rc.local ?

Sure. But it must be a invisible service. nobody should start or stop that service.Without their permission it should log all the keyboard entries.

--------------------------------

Aah. Actually I don't know if you can have invisible services in
Linux. If you use a deceptive command name for your keylogger - a
normal user who has no reason to suspect anything wouldn't give a
second thought even if he saw the command in a 'ps' listing. And a
normal user wouldn't be able to kill it even if he suspects it.

My box once got hacked into. I didn't realize it till I noticed an
unexplained increased in hard-disk activity. Did a ps and when through
the running programs with a fine comb to find the suspect program.
Since then, I've made an effort to learn IP tables :">

You  will  have to  'rootkit'  your ps,  etc.,..  What  would be  even

program that runs all the time (like 'init').

rdiff-backup is a good one too.

Hi
I have a query in using scp.
Can I mention the hostname(or ip address) in both the source and target
field in scp syntax.
That is, can I copy a file in machine A to machine B from machine C. If
yes,please send me the command.
Thanks a lot

 It is possible if you can use key mechanism as authentication method.
 I am not sure about passwords.

this link does not describe what the poster wants

What the poster wants is as follows :

[tom@symonds(22:19:46) (Sun Jul 25)~$
scp tom@mindspawn.unl.edu:/script tom@207.36.86.73:/script

On some third server.....he wants to transfer files from some first server
to a second server

In the above example....I am on symonds.net
I am transferring a file between mindspawn.unl.edu to the server with the
IP mentioned

The link you sent does not elaborate on this particular example.

Unfortunately, no. However you can write a script like this:

#!/bin/bash

# arguments this script takes
# 1: name of machine (A)
# 2: file(s) in machine (A)
# 3: name of machine (B)
# 4: target directory in machine (B)

if [ -n "$1" -a -n "$2" -a -n "$3" -a -n "$4" ]; then
   ssh $1 "tar -cz $2 -f -" | ssh $3 "tar -xz -C $4 -f -"
else
   echo "usage: $0 src_machine src_filespec dest_machine dest_filespec
fi

Note: 
  1: of course, I'm assuming this is GNU tar
  2: I haven't tested this script. please fix if any issues ;)

The question is not "How". The question is whether one
can mention hostname or ip address in scp syntax, and
the answer is yes and hence the link. Period.

   Some of you will recollect that Anand Babu mentioned in his lecture
that he was inspired by the description of RMS in the book by Steven
Levy as 'the last true hacker'. I remarked that that honour actually
belongs to Dennis Ritchie, who is still, in some sense, hacking away.

There's an article in the Economist about Dennis Ritchie, and everything
that's happened as a consequence of his work. It's a must read:

  I don't know for sure, but I have a couple of guesses.

really ?
why did you leave behind and not quote the relevant half of the question
and post only that which made sense to you ?
<quote>
That is, can I copy a file in machine A to machine B from machine C. If
yes,please send me the command.
Thanks a lot

Same is the case in Linux/FreeBSD/etc. The default fb is used, and the

  Actually, a lot of the code there will pass through modern ANSI C
compilers without incident; and the document can still be used as
a tutorial even today.

  The only tricky stuff probably relates to typedefs, qualifiers
and storage classes.

Hi all

Am a newbie to this group. Name is Suresh Menon, and my organization Sushma Multimedia is just preparing the foundation to setup a Linux facility.

We are looking for volunteers, for a 2-day program, meant for Programmers and government officials, to get a hang of the Linux platform, and to launch Linux applications including the Simputer. Are there any volunteers who will be able to come forward?

if both NIC are same make then using MAC Addr only you can
differentiate. But it is possible to associate eth0 to one
mac addr using "nameif" command.

Read man nameif

Hi!

$/sbin/ifconfig -a

I'am sorry to post this to this list. But i have no other way.
For the past few days i searched the web in vain to find out the igp 340M windows 2000 drivers. ( for my notebook compaq 2559 AH )
I downloaded some and it doesn't work.

Could you please let me know where are these drivers ?

You could also use nameif which allows the user to assign interface names.
Uses a startup file called /etc/mactab. Useful if you do not want to change
configuration or need specific interfaces (known MACs) to be called by known
device names as discovery sequence is not known.

  You probably can, but my solution uses Postfix + Cyrux-SASL + a dynamic
DNS domain from dyndns.org. There are RPMs for RH 7.3, which will probably
work with RH 9, perhaps after a rebuild from SRPM. Do a search on Google
for 'Postfix SASL HOWTO'.

You can't boot from the Sarge CDs and do the upgrade. You follow the 
following steps.

1. Back up yout /etc/apt/sources.list
2. Run dselect and choose Install from CD ROM set in the "Access" menu.
3. It will ask you to insert the CD. Insert the CDs one by one and this 
generates the sources.list file for you.
4. Then do an "Update".
5. Now your are ready to upgrade to the new packages. Directly go to the 
"Install" step and this should upgrade the needed packages.

This link may be of some use.
http://ceu.fi.udc.es/docs/debian-user-guide_1.0/node38.html

PS: I follow a different way. I have a local repository of the ISO 
images of all CDs, I mount them in loop device and do the install. This 
will reduce the pain of inserting the CDs when needed. *Courtesy: Suraj.*

Sarge installer is broken (atleast from the old DWN i read a couple of
weeks back). So DONOT use the installer given on the CD.

1. install using 3.0r2 CDs
2. use apt-cdrom to add the sarge CDs into the apt repository
3. apt-get    update;   apt-get    dist-upgrade   (and    follow   the
   instructions). You will be on sarge!

The dselect method suggested didn work.It exited at the begining of installation with an error message.I went for the next one 

I added the CDs into the apt repository after installing 3.0r2.Then i did an apt-get-update before apt-get dist-upgrade i was forced to do an apt-get -f install

then i did  apt-get dist-upgrade.It went on well with some 3/4 CDs and again exited.I remember that i configured some Xserver related things after that the installation exited.When i rebooted even the lilo which was there before is gone.

Help,pls.

 

TIA

1. enable smtp auth

2. let him use webmail (set up squirrelmail)

Deadly wrong! Please read this thread for a check list that Siva sent in 
reply several days ago.  It turned out that the fan over the PC 133 
Controller on the motherboard was not running every time, heating up the 
Controller, and after it was fixed, there have been no problems.  Anyway 
thanks, now, please allow this thread to Rest In Peace :)

Message-ID: <003e01c4753a$bbb26480$0300a8c0@Suresh>

Hi all,

Am looking for a browser based FTP solution on PHP. The objective is to
upload large files (500MB and above) to specific authorized directories on a
linux web server. The normal browser upload function refuses to function for
various reasons. One primary reason is that the PHP.INI file has a statement
restricting browser based uploads to 20MB, and the web hosts are not willing
to modify this for obvious reasons.

The solution is being made for an ad agency which requires a simple browser
based interface to transfer files between itself and its customers. The word
SIMPLE means that they dont want their non-IT-savvy clients to get stuck
with FTP clients.

Any ideas?

Parse your xml and then use PDFLib extension for pdf  generation.

Here are some tutorials on that

I was asked by Velammal Engg College to deliver a lecture at their
college on 29.7.04. Few of their students visited our LF2004 and were
keen to hear more about Free/OS Software.

I made a presentation to 3rd year students for about 2 hours
highlighting the  history and benefits of Linux and other Free/Open
source software. 

I touched upon the activities of ilugc and asked them to participate
in it. 

I feel that my presentation was well received and hope more students
will attend our lug.

I requested the HOD to allow us to conduct a seminar, which I hope
will materialise soon.

They are organising a seminar on Network Security sometime next week.
He is keen on someone from our side to talk in the seminar.

If anyone is interested in this topic please contact me.

Hi

Did this problem start after installing NISLDAP gatway. Then it could be 
nsswitch. Change username and password from nis to ldap. Actually i a 
using OpenLdap. With this i faced similar problem. In your grub use 
linux single to go to non password mode and rectify it.

hi,

 /pgrep/ is working fine, thank u Barathi.

i've also arrived to a solution. I tried checking for the open ports in 
the server if port 8080 is open then it means that tomcat is running.so 
i did a

    nmap /serverip /-p 8080 | grep -q open

this also works.

how about doing this? and which is the better one ?

tnx in advance

Just see whether your modem works under Linux, using this driver

So far, I haven't seen any successful installation of modems provided

Hi,
  I am using clamav for last 2 years. It is free and good. If you buy
  any anti virus tool for sendmail it will cost lot of money. They
  may charge depend on the number of users etc.

  One way to do is
  MailScanner + Antivirus (Clamav or any other) + Sendmail
  
  MailScanner comes with spamassassin. 

  You don't need to change any sendmail configuration. MailScanner 
  works as wrapper around sendmail. 

  Other approach is with amavisd + sendmail + virusscanner

Hi all,
Sorry it may be a off topic question.
What is the best way to measure the ethernet throughput?
By using a 100 MHz ethernet controller, how much maximum throughput 
can be obtained in a PC?? (Pentium 4 , 2.4 GHz running linux)??????? 
I have used an utility called "bing", in which I never be able to cross 30mbps.
?

I guess you meant '100 MBPS' and not '100MHz' :) anyway, Are you using

   Hub simply sends traffic to all hosts. It obviously will
   have performance issues.
  
   It is 100Mbps not 100MBps. A lot of other things also
   will come into picture like hard disk speeds etc.

   Also try with
   mii-tool
   and see what output you are getting.

Hi,

Of late i have been thinking of buying a USB flash memory. In 
Ritchie St., i found them coming in around 2k +/- 200 (128Mb). 
Some of them can playback mp3 formats as well. These are a bit
costly, touching almost 5k. And then there is SONY's 'Vault' 
range place at a bit higher ranges. Any recommendations ?

If u use 10/100Mbps ethernet in a network connected to
a hub then the speed is limited by the hub.

  Hubs are basically broadcasting device if u hv 8
port hub and ur other ports are all connected to your
hub and host the broadcasting speed is splitted to 1/8
th of the Basic speed .

  If u use switch instead of Hub u can achieve direct
transfer through put of 100Mbps -- u may face some
overheads even on that.

  functioning of switch is different from hub.

Make a copy of your /etc/X11/Xf86Config first:

#cp /etc/X11/XF86Config /etc/X11/XF86Config.backup

Now run either of these and reconfigure your X server
settings:

$xf86cfg

OR

$xf86config

Hi Anand!

Always handy to have USB flash memory. I have a SONY
64 MB USB Vault and two Sandisk 256 MB USB flash
drives and they work like a charm! 

I really wouldn't worry about the price as these are
long lasting and have great utility value.

Have fun shopping,

Shaks

Probably the filesystem is corrupt and /etc/ files are not found or
empty. May because of fsck. Try to use rescue disk and check the /
partition.

Hi Saha,

I use samsung yepp yp 55v. Though its expensive, its amazingly good.

Its an all-in-one kinda solution..

It features :

1. MP3 / WMA Player
2. MP3 Encoder
3. Line in recorder.
4. Voice recorder (2 hours of live music recording comes around 27-29 mb at
32 kbps)
5. Selectable Bitrate
6. FM
7. 256 mb storage space.
8. Customisable equaliser with presets too..
9. WOW / SRS effects.
10. Works with single AAA battery that, for me, lasts about 5 hours. (smart
choice would be to buy a recharger / rechargeable batteries).

and more....

Most importantly, you can connect it to your computer thru USB (ofcourse, it
works with GNU/Linux) and use its storage space to store any kinda file not
only mp3 or wma.

you can visit http://www.samsungyepp.com

As I said the player is expensive. When I got it it was around 210 USD. Now
I think, its around 150 USD. I believe its _WORTH_ it.

Hi buddy,

You can do this :

$_SESSION["variable-name"] = <value>;

I guess, in all the pages where you want to access this variable, in the top
of the script, say :

session_start();

thats it.

Reminding you of your friends : www.google.com and www.php.net/session_start

In Fedora you have all these configuration commands with a prefix
system-config and I belive they are not using XFree86 server. So check form
the possible commands by typing system-config<TAB>.

dpkg  is meant for debian packaging systems

I thought PHP was the coolest language. But after seeing your site and
projects I am thinking of learing python. Do you have some books on python.
Also what kind of servers support python. do I have to install anything else
for executing python?

   I have a lot of books on Python. PM me for the list.

Look here ...
http://www.python.org/topics/web/

* Apache supports python (mod_python [1]) - http://www.modpython.org/
* .. and there is Zope - http://www.zope.org/ (pretty large though)
* Spyce - http://spyce.sourceforge.net/
* Webware - http://webware.sourceforge.net/  and Cheetah 
* Cherrypy

Apart from all above, I prefer Twisted - http://twistedmatrix.com (twisted.web)

Here is the list of python friendly ISPs
