My point was that it does not install bind by default. Elsewhere in

I tend to disagree here. You are assuming that OpenDNS / Google DNS is
always reliable, correct and secure(???). If you dont trust your ISP
to provide the basic service that he is expected to provide reliably,
there is something wrong.

For the fact, I have been an Airtel Broadband user for over 5 years
now and I dont remember experiencing any major issues with their DNS.

$| tells perl to flush STDOUT immediately.

The program prints characters read from /etc/password at random
intervals. This simulates the typing effect on a screen.

As I said in my earlier mail, block all outgoing traffic from all the
hosts other than your gateway servers. so even if they try to use the
open proxy server, it would fail. And if they are using an anonymous
proxy, identify and start blocking them in your squid setup.


<offtopic>
Finally, these kind of issues are better solved by putting in a proper
IT policy and enforcing them. There will always be people finding
intelligent ways to work around this. Figure out what you are
achieving by blocking and see if there is a need for you to do it. If
you think it is absolutely needed, put in a policy to ensure that you
should not be putting such a process and implement them.

Compaq (part of HP) has been doing this since 2005/6.  They provide an
utility to make "recovery" media.  So does Sony VAIO.  (Use premium
media or you may be hosed).

This is the first activity (in my practice @ client) with systems that

>> On Saturday you said
>> foo foo foo
> On Sunday you said
> foobar

7. Do not post HTML messages

8. Do not recycle messages

9. Do not send attachments

10. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal
disclaimers. If your company uses disclaimers, don't
use your company ID for the mailing list.

11. Do not reply to a digest. (If you are in digest
mode and want to reply to a post use ILUGC Gmane blog
interface.

Link:
http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

12. Search for answers for your questions/problems in
google.com or any other search engine before posting
your query to the mailing list.

If any of the above are not clear to you, Please read
the detailed list guidelines:

Link:
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

13. Do not post messages in all capital letters. Mails
in CAPS is considered rude and is similar to shouting
during a conversation.

14. Following these guidelines could be helpful
http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/

15. Don't send season's greetings or birthday or social networking site
 invites to the group. Its not mailing list etiquette.

We must use the above guidelines to maintain better
readability, proper archives, efficient bandwidth
usage, etc.

To: "The Linux-Delhi mailing list\"" <ilugd@lists.linux-delhi.org>
Cc: iitdlug@googlegroups.com


NoParrots.com free Drupal trainings have been so far restricted to Delhi
NCR, India. They have been a great success. Our meetup group at
http://drupal-delhi.noparrots.com is already 100+ members large and we have
had 6 meetups so far. During these 6 meetings we have introduced Drupal
fundamentals. Its been a fun and humbling experience to have so many of you
come to my training center in Gurgaon every Sunday afternoon and listen to
me teach you a little bit of Drupal

But I've received calls and emails from people all the way from Kerala and
Bangalore to know if I offer online training. Starting from today, the
answer is "Yes!"

I'm happy to announce that starting from August 10th, 2010 (Tuesday) we'll
have free ONLINE Drupal training. Every week I intend to teach Drupal
fundamentals from 9 pm - 11 pm (Indian Standard Time). We'll try to keep it
on Tuesdays. For details please keep visiting http://www.noparrots.com and
http://drupal-delhi.noparrots.com

*If you have a broadband internet connection and an internet browser you
should be able to listen to my lectures and see me share my computer screen
as I demonstrate how to build websites in Drupal.*

As usual, I'll try to keep each session as independent as possible to the
previous one. You don't need any special programming knowledge to understand
Drupal.

*How can you join Free Online Drupal Training?*

? - Register yourself at http://drupal-delhi.noparrots.com
? - Say that you will be joining a particular meeting by RSVPing "Yes" on
? the meeting date
? - At the meeting time, join us at https://my.dimdim.com/learn_drupal (note
? that the URL https and not http)

*What is Drupal?*
*
*
*Drupal is a CMS (Content Management System), similar to Wordpress or Joomla
that allows you to rapidly build sophisticated and great looking websites.
The US President's website http://www.whitehouse.gov is a great example of a
website made in Drupal. Drupal itself is build on the PHP language (like
Facebook).

Dear All,

Greetings .!.

Do you have awareness about web3.0 ?

The Semantic Web is a web of data. There is lots of data we all use
every day, and it is not part of the web.
I can see my bank statements on the web, and my photographs, and I can
see my appointments in a calendar.
But can I see my photos in a calendar to see what I was doing when I
took them? Can I see bank statement lines in a calendar?

Why not? Because we don't have a web of data. Because data is
controlled by applications, and each application keeps it to itself.

Humans are capable of using the Web to carry out tasks such as finding
the Irish word for "directory", reserving a library book, and
searching for a low price for a DVD. However, one computer? cannot
accomplish all of these tasks without human direction,
because web pages are designed to be read by people, not machines.

The semantic web is a vision of information that is understandable by
computers, so computers can perform more of the tedious work
involved in finding, combining, and acting upon information on the web.

We are going to make web3.0 with the basics of semantic web.

Let us discuss about web3.0 in this mailing list.

Welcomes you to real data understandable by computer as data not as text !

- To join in the web3 mailing list, subscribe here
http://www.freelists.org/list/web3



What is the Semantic Web?

Where Web 2.0 is focused on people, the Semantic Web is focused on machines.
The Web requires a human operator, using computer systems to perform
the tasks required to find, search and aggregate its information.

It's impossible for a computer to do these tasks without human guidance
because Web pages are specifically designed for human readers.

The Semantic Web is a project that aims to change that by presenting
Web page data in such a way that it is understood by computers,
enabling machines to do the searching, aggregating and combining of
the Web's information ? without a human operator. :-)

You are a lucky guy. In my experience TATA, Airtel and BSNL all have
DNS server uptime issues. I used all of them simultaneously for over 3
years and have had issues. Once I switched to OpenDNS and other public
servers, this problem got resolved. The pity is that when we call
these ISPs and tell them their DNS is down, the call centre sees
stars. In BSNL DSL, one has to contend with their PPP auth server
going down often albeit for small periods like 1/2 to 1 hour. It is
better to wait it out than go thro' the pain of trying to explain to
the call centre guy who assumes we know nothing of networking. This
experience is in Bangalore though, not Chennai.

I don't hate him but it is hypocritical of anyone to preach what they
themselves don't follow. Here is a quote

http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/77

"As free software becomes more successful and more pervasive there will
be an increasing desire on the part of companies to make it more
proprietary. We?ve already seen that with Red Hat and Novell, which
essentially offer free software on proprietary terms ? their ?really
free? editions are not certified, carry no support and receive no
systematic security patching. In other words ? they?re beta or test
versions"

This claims Red Hat and Novell are not really offering Free software and
it also claims Fedora and openSUSE are just test versions offering no
systematic security patching. To put it directly, these are just lies
and obvious lies to smear the competition and promoting your own
product. In the Free software world, the competing vendors are actually
technology partners as well and both Red Hat and Novell release far more
free software than Canonical ever did and Canonical relies on every day
as part of their product. Red Hat also has a dedicated approach to Free
software that Canonical does not match. c,f Landscape, Ubuntu one etc.
Instead of giving credit where it is due, engaging in this level of
dishonesty looks like tribalism to me. In the same post that talks about
tribalism, he also compares with with sexism and obviously, the moral
weight of the track record on this will be pointed to.

In KDE, it can also be invoked by pressing the "PrtScn" button on the keyboard.

I believe the same may be true for GNOME as well.

May be he is suggesting a talk to provide a solution for his problem :D

</tongue in cheek>

Seriously though,  was there a Q&A session in last month's meet?   I
don't recall seeing any mention of it (I could have missed it).

Devote an 30-45 mins.  for Q&A, hopefully it will be in an incentive
to a lot of users to attend the meets, get to know other enthusiasts
and develop a rapport with membership.

My comment was more on the lines of "why yet another distro?",
although I did not say so in specific words.

Edbuntu is already there with LTS support (based on 8.04).  Thus would
it not be better to create an "apt-on" ISO that augments Edbuntu?

As others have asked, what are your plans in terms of providing
support, especially security updates?

School, college networks are notorious for a being a "hostile"
environment.    Recall the IIM CBT entrance exams fracas (conducted by
ETS).  In light of this unless you have plans to actively provide
security fixes (at a min.), I would suggest that an "apt-on" would be
the way to go.   I would also suggest that you choose a LTS version.

My two cents.

I don't think that is a interesting question.  There are hundreds and
dozens create newly everyday.   Understandably there will be questions
about sustainability but if it is a simple matter of a change in the
default set of packages and some configuration changes, this isn't
really a problem.

I am sure that, not a single Chip vendor can come with this cost.
Most of ARM vendor including TI can't come close to 70$ for Processor and
Motherboard. [ SOC http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System-on-a-chip }
Intel Atom never be the choice. Have look at power consumption which is 2
watt.
2 Watts of power consumption while solar charging and conventional

LTS from Ubuntu is aways buggy and unstable.
Recent Ubuntu 10.04 lucid has lots of bugs. Lucid is the most unstable
distro from Ubuntu also copied these from MacOS is very ugly.
Karmic 9.10 is much better. that is why schoolos beta version (beta was made
over kamic and final was planned on Lucid) is the final version from long
time for this year.

In Linux distro, If you insert LAN Cable, then Distro should give a Pop
message where user can enter for IP address (if there is not DHCP)
In Linux distro, if Netconnect is inserted then should ask for password in
first time setting via popup menus.

Also, we will make a small CD with grub rescue. when you insert this CD ,
you need not to a single click anything. software will detect list of
installed Linux systems and automatically install new grub on MBR. Imagine
if this can be done without a single click !
LAN Drop box is another future software. In GUI, you will see PC connected
to LAN with name. Just Drag and Drop file over the given icon on PC. How
easy to transfer files using drag and drop. I remember many of the LAN use
to transfer file using email (gmail)

when you add gmail account in Pidgin, it ask for username - and password -
But why Resource and port number (you sucks)
It should only autofill all the data.

with SchoolOS we are mainly focused on usability of Linux Distro,

Got it  had to enable line 383 in httpd.conf

'ScriptInterpreterSource registry'

Which essentially makes Apache to call perl.exe when it encounters a file
with perl shebang.

[arun@localhost ~]$ vlc
VLC media player 1.0.6 Goldeneye
[0x991b8b0] main libvlc: Running vlc with the default interface. Use 'cvlc' to use vlc without interface.
[0x99f4f98] main generic error: no dialogs provider module matched "any"
[0x99ddc20] skins2 interface error: no suitable dialogs provider found (hint: compile the qt4 plugin, and make sure it is loaded properly)
[0x99ddc20] skins2 interface: skin: subX  author: Martin Poehlmann

It plays only some versions and menu bar is not displaying.I tried of compiling VLC with qt plugin as 

configure --enable-qt4

But no use.I had already used vlc in my previous version of my Fedora , it worked fine . I had searched many forums but unable to fix my problem . Could anybody help me .

I am using 2.6.33.6-147.fc13.i686.PAE version of Kernel and 2.30.0 version of GNOME

I assume you are a student , raise this issue to the management , explain
them about the need of it. If they are not listening, you have to hang on
with it.
AFAIK and I am sure, list members will not give you any technical help on
your request. Another better way is access them at home.

Is it user friendly experience or usability.

Message-ID: <AANLkTim5jkTy1Z-Qgb=J5g-3CN4tsERd704aoT=0NfBj@mail.gmail.com>

NoParrots.com free Drupal CMS trainings have been so far restricted to Delhi
NCR, India. They have been a great success. Our meetup group at
http://drupal-delhi.noparrots.com is already 100+ members large and we have
had 6 meetups so far. During these 6 meetings we have introduced Drupal
fundamentals. Its been a fun and humbling experience to have so many of you
come to my training center in Gurgaon every Sunday afternoon and listen to
me teach you a little bit of Drupal

But I've received calls and emails from people all the way from Kerala and
Bangalore to know if I offer online training. Starting from today, the
answer is "Yes!"

I'm happy to announce that starting from August 10th, 2010 (Tuesday) we'll
have free ONLINE Drupal training. *Every week* I intend to teach Drupal CMS
fundamentals from 9 pm - 11 pm (Indian Standard Time). We'll try to keep it
on Tuesdays. For details please keep visiting http://www.noparrots.com and
http://drupal-delhi.noparrots.com

*If you have a broadband internet connection and an internet browser you
should be able to listen to my lectures and see me share my computer screen
as I demonstrate how to build websites in Drupal.*

As usual, I'll try to keep each session as independent as possible to the
previous one. You don't need any special programming knowledge to understand
Drupal.

*How can you join Free Online Drupal Training?*

   - Register yourself at http://drupal-delhi.noparrots.com
   - Say that you will be joining a particular meeting by RSVPing "Yes" on
   the meeting date
   - At the meeting time, join us at https://my.dimdim.com/learn_drupal (note
   that the URL https and not http)

*What is Drupal?*
*
*
*Drupal is a CMS (Content Management System), similar to Wordpress or Joomla
that allows you to rapidly build sophisticated and great looking websites.
The US President's websitehttp://www.whitehouse.gov is a great example of a
website made in Drupal. Drupal itself is built on the PHP language (like
Facebook).*

*Questions?*
*
*
Visit www.noparrots.com or email me at learndrupal[at]noparrots[dot]com for
more details

There are lot of applications you can bring to cloud.Some of the simple
applications like Library Management,Time Table Management.And some advanced
software's  like Version control system,Compilers etc.

The thing is not the application you bring but how far you understand the
cloud computing
 concepts is that matters.And i am also trying to do project in cloud
computing.

Third option is to ask the library to make available those educational
videos on CD/DVD/USB. Surely library/IT staff will have full access to
internet.

Of course, It will be your responsibility to give the proper links
with an authorization from the faculty members.

In fact ILUG can contemplete mirroring such videos in their websites

Of course, I wont open the can of worms of IPR, DMCA, licence et al.

Hi allm

I was looking for jQuery based ajax rating and i didnt find one. hence i
forked ajaxful-rating <http://github.com/edgarjs/ajaxful-rating> project and
thus jQuery based ajax rating was born. Try it out and let me know the
feedback. source is released in Git.

*Install*:
gem install jqrating

*Generator*:
ruby script/generator jqrating

*db/migrations:*
rake db:migrate

rest of them works similarly like ajaxful-rating. see ajaxful-rating README
<http://github.com/edgarjs/ajaxful-rating>for more information

*RubyGems*

Application: qcodo

What it is:

The Qcodo Development Framework is an open-source PHP web application
framework which builds an Object Relational Model (ORM), CRUD (Create,
Retrieve, Update, Delete) UI pages, and AJAX  hooks from an existing
data model. It additionally includes a tightly-integrated HTML and
JavaScript form toolkit which interfaces directly with the generated
entities. It is a robust, comprehensive framework which can be
utilized by small and large Web applications alike.

The framework consists of three main components: the Code Generator,
QForms (OOP generated stateful Ajax- or server-processed webform),
QQuery (OOP based SQL Query builder)

Solved!

Network interface was the issue I think but I am not sure.

I changed the order of the adapters, host-only first and NAT as second.

I couldn't find the host-only adapter settings in /etc/network/interfaces.
Added it manually.

With this I still couldn't access the web page.

Then set the 'server.socket_host' (CherryPy config setting) to guest's 
ip and tried, it worked!
Should have thought of this earlier.

Thanks SAG!

You should catch hold of a Linux distribution first. Then install it,
play with it and learn Linux.

Then you can go on to linux internals.

Doing a project in linux is for people who know something about linux already.

However many students also want to do a project in linux without knowing linux.

Even that is fine.

I believe "contribute" is a better usage than "give up". It gives a
negative sense and alters the meaning.

Its nice to be part of a democratic country, please stop drowning the people
with the options, we don't know what to pick and what to leave. Which group
to join and which to subscribe. If the same situation prolongs people would
not know which party to support since too many regional parties. Same thing
could happen to the lug groups too. I hope we have enough groups, I am sure
our inbox are flooded with the e-mails not sure whether we another group to
promote the F/OSS. Why cant you do the same joining in hand with the
existing groups.

Hi Sir,


My objective is not to start a group a group with a Fancy name.This is actually a User group already existing in our college. I am promoting a FOSS group at my University with my own efforts . Because my university is not supporting FOSS activities , so people at my college donot know what linux is . All the existing group is talking Linux in Higher way, So as per my friends request i am starting a group to describe open source in a very basic way.

Arun Prakash

Hi Girish,

Thank you very much.

>>> Doing a project in linux is for people who know something about linux already.

If that qualifies a person for doing a Linux based project ,then I think I am.


My distro is Fedora. Recently toying with version 12.  I should have
mentioned it earlier but i thought it is not necessary then.

I have done both User and kernel space programming in Linux. Since I
find it mind blowing, I want to get in to the next step that is
learning Linux kernel internals.

I had tried to achieve this earlier but in vain. What I am looking for
is an idea, a starting point in a form of a project which will get me
going, of course with ILUG-C's guidance.

Please let me know If you guys need more info from me to guide me

Thanks,
Vijay

I am not here to discourage you. are you new to the list? if so, u have to
watch out the activity i guess. many groups are there based on colleges
which are kind of branch from ILUGC. for e.g. KanchiLUG.

they get all the support from ILUGC + they are people from kanchipuram. you
will get all the all help. at ILUGC, we talk about Linux, FOSS in beginner,
intermediate, advanced levels. please ask your people to join ILUGC list (+
your list local to your own community). Publish the summary from your list
activities on ILUGC so that people here are also will help you in your
initiatives in your community.

I would request you to check out various FOSS clubs in colleges here
http://www.ilugc.in/foss-clubs  .

I have watched the great activites by these groups (Locally + being part of
ILUGC)
1. AVIT FOSS Club
2. Jaya FOSS Club
3. Kanchi Linux User Group

wish you all the best for your efforts, learnings, initiatives...

use eucalaptus for cloud, configure hadoop cluster, then configure KVM in
different OS (Debian lenny, RHEL etc) using proxmox,libvert etc. etc...First
complete this much then ask for applications.

If application makes a big sense for you then configure an application
server inside, and then rocks.

Yes you can do that using cron job [1]. Please make sure that function
doesn't receive any argument through HTTP methods either get or post.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] [Request] Need Speaker to undertake a Nokia-Qt
	Workshop at SRM University
Message-ID: <AANLkTinO31hmg5A9KkH3yjGtLgHqwVfeZSZAfgkwa5sf@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We students at SRM University are organizing our National Level
Departmental Symposium in Sept 2010. This symposium happens once in
every two years.
As it comes under Computer Science Department, we are in need of help
from ILUGC for making this symposium a grand success. Till now we have
discussed and decided some Open Source Technologies and keeping in
mind the latest trends in the IT/Software industry we have sorted out
some topics. One of them is Qt development on Nokia Platform.

If anyone can undertake such workshop/techtalk or know someone
(preferably in Chennai, Bangalore or anywhere else in India) who has
experience on Qt development and can take a workshop for the same then
please reply..

Edit The Command Line With Vim

This is a quick (and great) tip I found at Daily Vim:

Open a linux terminal, and type some (long) command.
Now type [ctrl]+[x] and then [ctrl]+[e]
The command should be moved now to a vim window.
Edit the command (fix typos, change parameters, etc..) and save.
The command will now be executed. :)

       Actually, it would open the user's editor, i.e. which ever is
pointed to by the $EDITOR var. So, not just vim, but any preferred
editor can be opened this way for editing the command. But given that
a shell like bash by itself supports editor key-bindings, it should be
easy enough to do it in the shell itself(at least for bash). By
default, it is emacs key bindings and can be set to vi as well. Thanks

Great app.

One can also look into Amanda (or Zmanda -- it's commercial couterpart).

Fantastic. What I loved about Amanda is it's Virtual Tapes
(essentially [block device] disk which could be NAS, SAN, DRB, remote
FTP's(?) etc. etc. )

the best part of it is that it stores in common tar.gz or zip or the
such compressed file format. so you can recover your data without
installing amanda recovery tool, so to say.

Well, I didn't say it is for gui warriors. Rather for commandline-fus. :)

Tremendous stuff these backup tools are.

I haven't tested the BMR (bare metal recovery) part though with any of
these tools.

I suggest we start/continue this thread on the shortest BMR starting
with, say "dd if=/dev/sda [or <whatever>] of=<whatever>" for backing
up and the inverse for restoration.

any takers?

If I'm right the Huawei E1550 is marketed as Netsetter by Idea. This,
by default is carrier LOCKED. So you'll not be able to use with any
other service provider.
But, the one I got was carrier UNLOCKED by the seller. You might want
to check this with your seller before purchasing.

You cn do most of the command line editing via readline.

set -o emacs or set -o vim

and most of the vim and emacs command line editing will work on the shell.

emacs is the default behavior in bash, ksh, zsh in my experience which
can be overriden by shell's builtin function

bash being the CLI by default, simply put the above in your .bashrc.

In csh, again the default is emacs.  For vi use "bindkey -v" for vi
editing behavior.

now, my Debian 5.0 release 0 is not booting! Here, the point is, I had
postgresql and mysql database there and those had lot of data. Now, I really

postgresql 8.3 now too. Is it possible to bring back that server with it`s

2. You installed postgresql and mysql from source or from Debian binary?

If you can installed Debian 5.0 in another disc, install your pg
version, mount the partitions from earlier disc, copy the data
directory (for postgresql) to the new installation and get your data
back

1. Why installed Debian 5.0 is not booting? What is the error message?

If you can install same version in another disc, you can copy the data
directory and access data. But, it would be far easier to trouble
shoot the booting problem recover the installation.

I think vijay mentioned 'ltrace'. However, 'ltrace' handles only 
compiled C/C++ binaries whereas 'strace' will accept any kind of file 
even if it is a shell script, in that case, it traces all system calls 
made by 'bash'. Same rule applies to python, perl, ruby etc.,

1. unpack them - unzip, tar -xvzf, bunzip2 etc
2. read the file called README or the file called INSTALL. Mainly for C
packages it will be ./configure, make, make install. For python it would
be python setup.py install
3. if you have easy_install on python you need not even download or
unpack the file - just use easy_install <packagename>

Message-ID: <AANLkTikaQ_d-5ix0Uh5zoBk72ehTEt1ifuWL-rDwzt25@mail.gmail.com>

Ever wanted to know that someone is really offline or has just gone
invisible in GTalk? Here is a small trick. The bellow peace of python
code get the list of invisible users from your GTalk buddy list. It
uses XMPP module for python. You can install this module in
Ubuntu/Debian via apt. It also requires python dns module.

sudo aptitude install python-xmpp python-dnspython

Now here is our script. Open your favorite text editor and save the
code as ?gchat.py?. Dont forget to fill your gtalk username and
password in the script.

#gtalk.py

import xmpp

# Google Talk constants
FROM_GMAIL_ID = "username@gmail.com"
GMAIL_PASS = "secret passwd"
GTALK_SERVER = "gmail.com"

jid=xmpp.protocol.JID(FROM_GMAIL_ID)
C=xmpp.Client(jid.getDomain(),debug=[])

if not C.connect((GTALK_SERVER,5222)):
    raise IOError('Can not connect to server.')
if not C.auth(jid.getNode(),GMAIL_PASS):
    raise IOError('Can not auth with server.')

C.sendInitPresence(requestRoster=1)

def myPresenceHandler(con, event):
   if event.getType() == 'unavailable':
     print event.getFrom().getStripped()

C.RegisterHandler('presence', myPresenceHandler)
while C.Process(1):
  pass


$ python gchat.py
So , Next time do not let anyone fool you , rather catch him Invisibly.   ;-)

pg_dump will help you recover postgres DB.

Moreover you can do a dump/restore with SystemliveCD with Debian.

That works very well. I shall write an article with that soon.

Sorry to hear this!

Dear all,

I ended up needing to do a TCP proxy for my product SpamCheetah.

Some of my troubles are chronicled here.

http://aplawrence.com/Girish/socat.html

I ended up writing the whole thing in the great C programming language
and got rid of socat completely.

It is horrors to me to start 4 separate processes for virus scanning.

Anyway please look at the code here:

ftp://64.85.171.142/upload/smtprelay.c.html

It is running live on a very busy mail server site in Chennai.

So I hope it is of production quality.

Solaris has DTrace which allows you to instrument/trace all kinds of
applications in great depth -- C, Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Java, etc.
DTrace is also available on some BSD systems.

I've found DTrace exceptionally useful in performance tuning.

The Linux equivalents -- SystemTap and LTTng -- lack some
advanced features of DTrace, but are rapidly catching up.

You have *not* posted any error message (if any).

Have you tried to boot it with the latest version of Fedora/Ubuntu
LiveCD?  If so what are the symptoms?

I would suggest that inquire from vendor if replacement motherboard is
100% one-to-one at chip level with the fried motherboard.

If the above is not the case then your installed Debian is not booting
because most likely the initrd image does not have the proper drivers
installed for the new motherboard installed by your vendor.

OR your GRUB  and /etc/fstab has stuff like  UUID="blahblah"  Before
spinning your wheels I would suggest that you boot the system with a
systemrescuecd and change the UUID lines to appropriate /dev/sd[A][B]
device mappings and ensure /boot/grub/device.map is consistent with
/dev/sd[A][B] mappings.

If the above does not solve your problem then - you can try the
following steps to make yourself an initrd file compatible to your
"new" motherboard  (hope you have access to a spare disk - even a 20GB
should be OK)

1. Use spare disk as primary aka /dev/sda to install a minimal Debian
of the version you have on the "production" system.  Backup important
PG and MySQL dirs to another disk and make production disk as /dev/sdb
(eg.)
2. Copy the initrd image to your "production" disk /dev/sdb in this example.
3. Make production disk primary
4. Boot the system and hopefully it should solve your dilemma without
having to do a full re-install of Debian and copying your PG and MySQL
data

I would  suggest that you make a  backup of your data to a safe
location before embarking on any "surgery" activity.

-- Arun Khan
PS If all of the above fails -  your last resort  would be a fresh
install, config, and copy of files as others have suggested.

I was based at Trichy till a fortnight back when I moved to Bangalore.
I can try referring some persons who can get the job done or in the
worse case I can try helping when I visit my home at Trichy during
weekends.

Subject: [Ilugc] sugar gummed up the engine
Message-ID: <1280991553.3358.75.camel@localhost>

hi,

just back from a torrid time with sugar. I installed @sugar-desktop.
After that kmail started crashing. Firefox crashed and refused to load
again and the whole machine slowed down. So I tried to reboot or
shutdown - both did not work. Finally manually shut down the machine. On
boot I logged in and got the sugar desktop - and there was no way to
exit it. I created another user and tried to login with that user - no
way, only one user showed on the grahic log in screen. Then I used yum
to remove sugar. No joy - login just produced a blank screen. Then I
removed every reference to sugar wherever I could find it. Still no
luck. Finally I had to take a backup and reinstall fedora 12. Then kmail
started acting up - it downloaded 124 mails and ate them up. And
spambayes kept crashing. Then I tried thunderbird - that hung with a
javascript error. Finally I switched to gnome and evolution - so far so
good. And evolution is more sensible than kmail - no funny methods of
configuring things!

so what did I do wrong?

Thanks a lot for your help. Do you or does anyone else know if there
is an active LUG at NIT Trichy? Can they be contacted for this?

Ok, I have tried with livecd in server, but the problem occurs now is:
"Inpu/Output Error" of /var directory, where my postgresql "data" files are
there.
I have retrieved pdf files but not the sql file, because it is in
/var/postgresq directory. Is there any possibility of retrieving data from
that "Input/Outpu Error" /var directory? Here, I want to mention that, my
RAID also crashed and the vendor changed it already.

It was active long long ago. But when the coordinator completed his degree,
no body card about it, I guess :)

I guess Input/Output error implies that your partition is damaged :-(.

Do you have any automatic backup of db in some other partition? Or are
you storing log files in some other directory?

I could not think of any other way you can get the data back, others
may have better ideas.

What kind of application and what data you have in the db? Is it
feasible to load the last week's backup and inform users to enter data
for the past week?

(I normally install from source /usr/local/pgsql and have a cron
script taking backup of db every hour and store in /home (/home and
/usr/local are in separate partitions). In production servers, we also
put a USB device to backup db every hour. Both these overwrite the
previous backup.
If your db data partition is lost, you will atleast have an hour's
early backup to rebuild.

Once in a day, the backup is copied to another directory with date in
the file name. If the hourly backup file is corrupt, you will have a
one day old backup to work with.)

It is really dreadful when we realize that we do not have the backup
and data directory is lost. Importance of backup is only felt in these
situations.

Somehow, try to piece together the data lost and take precautions
(backups, backups, backups) for the future.

I am afraid your options may be limited to going back to your last db backup.

What RAID configuration were you using - RAID1, RAID5, or RAID6?

For RAID1 I would suggest use kernel software RAID (mdadm).    Most
RescueCDs have the mdadm utils and it would have been possible to
recover data.

With huge hard disk spaces available backing up data over network in another system is the best method. Haveing a cronjob do this automatically using ssh+rsync/rdiffbackup will give peace of mind.

Who and What is doing What on Your System - finding open sockets, files etc.

? ? ? $ lsof
? ? ? ? ?or as root
? ? ? $ watch lsof -i

? ? To list all open Internet files, use:

? ? ? $ lsof -i -U

? ? You can also get very specific about ports. Do this as root for low

? ? ? $ lsof -i TCP:3306

 Have anybody thought for security issue as password is in plaintext format !!

Try this.:)

#gtalk1.py
#Based on script  by "Tha.Suresh" (sent to ILUGC mailing list)
#modified by Ashish Bhatia

import xmpp
import getpass

# Google Talk
FROM_GMAIL_ID = raw_input("Enter gmail ID:")
GMAIL_PASS = getpass.getpass("Enter Password:")
GTALK_SERVER = "gmail.com"

jid=xmpp.protocol.JID(FROM_GMAIL_ID)
C=xmpp.Client(jid.getDomain(),debug=[])

if not C.connect((GTALK_SERVER,5222)):
  raise IOError('Can not connect to server.')
if not C.auth(jid.getNode(),GMAIL_PASS):
  raise IOError('Can not auth with server.')

C.sendInitPresence(requestRoster=1)

def myPresenceHandler(con, event):
 if event.getType() == 'unavailable':
   print event.getFrom().getStripped()

C.RegisterHandler('presence', myPresenceHandler)
while C.Process(1):
 pass

Mr.Ashish Bhatia modified it a bit, so that, user does not have to
keep password in the file.
It asks for username and password on the start.

Hi Rajesh,

You can look at the following for a list of frameworks,

http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks

I personally enjoyed django.

I think, most of the web frameworks should be able to handle complex logic
as it

depends on the individual who writes logic rather than the frameworks.

People have pointed you to web frameworks, is that what you were
looking for?  Or were you looking for frameworks for the "huge amount
of logics to be performed, lot of artificial intelligence"?

I need a web framework if it has support for desktop inteface say like open
objects, well and good, more database complexity is involved in this

For web try CherryPy/Webpy or Turbogears/Django depending upon the 
complexity of the interface.
For desktop, check out WxPython?

* Check out sudo. Sudo can also be configured to read password from stdin.
* Second option is to see if you can run the daemon itself which you
are trying to restart as a non-root user. In that case you dont need
root privileges for restart.

I'm not sure how being a non-root user will affect anything.
But to the question of how, I believe the answer can be found in our
very own chmod.
If your script is located in /foo/bar/script.sh, you have to just do a
"chmod u+s /foo/bar/script.sh" as root.
More details can be found in chmod's manual page.

As a security precaution, Unix systems never honor set UID/GID
bit for shell/perl/python/other scripts.

Set UID works only on binaries.

platforms are increasing all around the world.

http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Accenture-survey-sees-open-source-investment-rising-1051499.html

I need a help from you, anyone knows any website, which gives list of the
stable open source applications in different category.

Fg.

for developers gEdit is a good tool to develop a program,
like this for Page layout designing InkScape is good one.

But when I search in google there are lot of tools available.
I don't know which one is a stable one to use.

I'm sorry. I agree. I made my script executable before I used the
above said command. =)
So maybe a chmod +x and then a chmod u+s

Still won't work.  Set uid has no effect on script files.
Set uid works only on binaries

I wrote a bash script to automatically change frequency of my cores
using cpufrequtils some time back. cpufrequtils required privileges. I
did the above, and the script worked just fine.

Great!

Have you tried to mirror the Court cases available on the websites
using semantic search?

The data is freely available.

Lawyers will come drooling and crawling to you for that kind of app.

That's what distributions are for. Most distributions would offer you one 
default choice for your task. This choice might even be different based on the 
desktop manager you use. Most distributions will have a GUI package manager 
which would list, group and let you search for apps, based on the task you want 
to do.

One good thing about going with the distribution's choice is that stability of 
the app is to an e?tent certified by the fact that it is packaged with the 
distribution and you have one place to report all your bugs to.

At the end of the day though, I would recommend trying out different apps and 
seeing what fits you the best.

Finally, this isn't a problem unique to Linux, it's just that the M$ monopoly 
and unethical practices(*) of actively shoving 'preferred' applications down 
peoples throat desensitizes one to the fact that choice is abundant on any OS.

cheers,
- steve

(*) like using unclear ^standards^, breaking compatibility between OS versions, 
using proprietary undocumented API for which developers of 'preferred' apps need

Open Any Folder from Your GNOME Desktop


Today we have a quick tip for productivity in your GNOME desktop. This
is not a well-known technique, but it is very fast and a quick way to
open any folder.

While on your desktop (either with no windows open or with the desktop
focused) type / (forward slash). Now type in a folder path and hit
Enter. The directory will be opened in a new Nautilus window. On top
of that, it will also autocomplete most paths.

For a quick usage example, say I want to get to /var/lib quickly.
Instead of having to open Nautilus and navigate to it, I just type the
path out on the desktop. /var/lib Enter, and boom, I'm in the folder.

Friends,

I have an idea for this SFD 2010, Lets say we construct a digital wall using
multiple monitors(LCD) and play video in such a wall , will be a theatrics
feel.
Imagine playing a video in such a wall will be fantastic.
Is it doable in the first place, if so what are the requirements.

Nice idea. It will help enticing laymen audience coming there towards
GNU/Linux.

It is doable theoretically(i mean software isn't a problem). Just need to
apply 'wall filter' in VLC. Limitations are in hardware.

I have done this with two monitors but,
  1. I did it with a graphics card with extra port for 2nd monitor and so
lot of graphics cards may be needed.('plan B': anyone know how to attach
multiple monitors without card?)
  2. Not sure of performance issues. (Assuming you have lots of graphics
card solves this, but for plan B?)
  3. Where to get such a high quality video that looks good even after
zooming in a big wall?

Hmmm. You talk as though some system programs are your subordinates. ;)

How will they ask you? Let us see.

You can put checks and balances but it requires effort.

To begin with GPRS is slow even with EDGE.

Wireless is always messy particularly non fixed wireless. If mobile
then even more troublesome.

Now you have to first identify which program is eating the bandwidth.
First use a tool like
pktstat, bwm-ng or trafshow and identify.

Then you can smooth traffic using trickle.

When we way 'they agreed', we mean following:

a.We can use vast open space infront of the planetarium without disturbing common public.
b.We can use a seminar hall with seating capacity of 50
c.We can use the public toilets
d.We can get few power supply points.

that's all. Please do not imagine that whole planetarium is handed over to us.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimqWtF_dHqtSGgeE-5bLBJgd7bzf_RzgzY--nPj@mail.gmail.com>

sir,

I too would like to give a helping hand in this.

I once heard from my RSM (Reg Sales Manager) when he was referring to
Mahatma Gandhi : "Greatness is doing the Ordinary things in an extraordinary
way".  Never trying to do the extraordinary things at all.

This may not be in anyway corresponding to this discussion, but we always
remember this when we try to give a presentation to one of our serious
prospects, or, whenever we take part in any technical exhibitions.

I would like to do the same things once again - for those who come (apart
from the students) :

- who are using Windows
- also looking at other ones (may be due to some virus / commerical reasons)
- but are not sure to contact any serious vendor to come /go & discuss with
them
- first would like to use themselves & then later on they would like to take
them into their official use
- see how easies / difficult to migrate from Windows to Open Source
- what is the support level / how they can get support - FOR THE MOST SIMPLE
THINGS that are needed in the daily official use
- whether they themselves can do most of the support for the daily official
use
and so on.

I still suggest to do the most ordinary things :


   - explain to them what are the ordinary things they perform with computer
   : personnally at home / and officially
   - use mail, surf web, use to write documents, use to compute with
   spreadsheets, do presentations, and sometimes watch movies, and hear music.
   - how we do the same with Thunderbird / Evolution, Firefox / Google,
    Open Office / K Office / Symphony / Abiword / Gnumeric etc, VLC player etc.
   - how to do dual booting with Windows & Linux etc
   - how to connect with their official windows mail server (through
   exchange etc) like this

All the above mentioned things are not something different,  but, which are
the most ordinary & sensible things that one might want to.

I would still want one or two old pcs : just for showing how to install &
dual boot :  one / two PCs with Openoffice etc.

MAY BE I AM WRONG - in saying these.

In any case, thanks for the opportunity.

Correction in my blog.

Update

   1. I have corrected the title of the blog.  read 'OLPCIndia will
purchase'  as 'OLPC should purchase'

   2. $65.1 dollar is Custom Duties (this is not shipping cost, this is in
addition to shipping cost) when one XO laptop comes in

  3.  This is my personal blog. This is not an official blog of OLPC India.
I have expressed my own view and should not be considered as official
statement from OLPC-India Or  OLPC.

hi friends

I have an idea of doing "Linux distro" as my final year project.
Will it be better if i start with any already installed linux OS or by using
the LFS(Linux From Scratch) live cd directly?
If i use any linux OS which would do better for creating distro?



Thanks in advance

Hi,

Creating a linux distro is a piece of cake nowadays.

There is nothing to do by yourself.
you just to need to follow some how-to.

Dont call it as a academic project.
It would be as a classwork.

Do some programming.
Create some applications from scratch.
Contribute to any existing open source application.

Application: Cantor

What it is:

Cantor is a free software mathematics application for scientific
statistics and analysis.[1][2] It is part of the KDE Software
Compilation 4, and was introduced with the 4.4 release[1] as part of
the KDE Education Project's kdeedu package.

Features:

Cantor is a graphical user interface that delegates its mathematical
operations to one of several back ends. As of version 0.1, it can make
use of Sage, Maxima, R or KAlgebra[3].

Cantor provides a consistent interface to these backends; its project
page lists the following features[3]:

        * Nice Worksheet view for evaluating expressions
        * View of plotting results inside the worksheet or in a separate window
        * Easy plugin based structure to add different Backends
        * GetHotNewStuff integration to upload/download example worksheets
        * Typesetting of mathematical formulas using LaTeX
        * Backend aware syntax highlighting
        * Plugin based assistant dialogs for common tasks (like
integrating a function or entering a matrix)

To know more about:

You are correct. I was not in the know of things at that time and was

I just thought if one can use the planetarium projector as the keynote
instrument.

The star projector cannot be used to project slides/images. It projects
points of light through 100's of lenses.
The secondary dome projector in Chennai is a regular high lumen projector.
It projects the images/slides into a spherical mirror which reflects into
the dome. The images are all pre-rendered as fish eye projections. The
spherical mirror projects these fish eye images into the dome which creates
the visual treat. Even if you get this setup, you need to create fish eye
slides.

In fact I am trying to help/persuade them to change this into a Linux based
Stellarium presentation. They are stuck with old proprietary software for
the shows.

The first line in your blog reads -

I (on behalf of OLPC-India) just want to give another proof where the
current system of Governance in India is NOT supporting OLPC.

: and that is somewhat orthogonal to point #3 above.

Just search for fonts in net and download the fonts folder and place
it at /usr/share/fonts. The next time when you open GIMP the fonts
will be available for you.

A systematic implementation of LFS is the greatest and best way to learn
about the GNU/Linux system. As for it being your final year project, guess
you need to take advise from the others. I personally would prefer to employ
anybody who has implemented a LFS system from scratch as a final year
project than any "standard" project. But you need to go by industry norms
regarding employability and project work.

 To add to my prev reply, what I meant by LFS from scratch meant installing
it from sources, including a boot strap compilation and recompilation of the
GCC tool chain...

I also second that. LFS can be a learning project and help the student
stand in good stead for job interviews. It will demonstrate strong
planning, implementation and testing skills.

1. Check with you teacher whether this will be an acceptable project.
2. Work with a Linux expert as guide to do the project.
3. Have a powerful system (a lot of RAM, hard disk space) and fast
internet connection to work with.

I think its seems to be a  medium for a entry level  speakers to learn the
art of public speaking.

Please make sure, you have some good speakers, that could attract more
crowd. For any assistance you can contact the ilugc and its co-ordinator to
help you out.

Do ensure that post things on the next meet on time among your busy
schedule.

Thanks,

LONG LIVE the PHP, only the PHP.

I was piqued by this query.

I find this trend very interesting though it is not so easy.

Every entrepreneur treads the path of the unknown and particularly in
South India
unless you are from a background that deals with business it is very tough.

That too in the Indian milieu it is even harder.

In fact anyone with corporate exposure and a bit of work experience
can start a company.

And the age factor counts a lot too.

I think it is not very wise to get into it unless you are at least 28
though this is only a guess. Nothing more.

I find that many youngsters don't get the maturity necessary for biz
before that age.

You should be good at people skills and never show anger openly and
also have a lot of patience.

With a lot of patience with others you should have a lot of speed in
execution and a spirit of
 hope and positive thinking.

With these values you can do anything.

Best of luck.

-Girish

I don't understand this problem but procmail is a user MUA filter and
there are filters
 at server side like postfix. Not sure which mail server is run at ILUGC.

Oh it is postfix.

$  nc -v www.ae.iitm.ac.in 25
Connection to www.ae.iitm.ac.in 25 port [tcp/smtp] succeeded!
220 www.ae.iitm.ac.in ESMTP Postfix


In postfix there are several things you can do in /etc/postfix/master.cf

I normally don't trust anything from any big company.

Moreover I never trust commercial software. Only open source.

And I have done very well(technically) due to this worldview.

If you have a business idea, then incubation centres will offer you
guidance. I'm not aware of those in Chennai but IIMB NSRCEL in
Bangalore does this.

I've done this before when email used to be delivered to my machine
rather than to GMail/YMail/etc. That used procmail to do additional
filtering before mail landed up in one of my inboxes.

The standard recipe ('man procmailex' or
http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/dapper/man5/procmailex.5.html )
uses the Message-ID field content to check for duplicates. The
Message-ID should be the same for cross-posts.

A minor variant with a clear explanation is here:
http://ramblings.narrabilis.com/wp/filtering-duplicate-emails-with-procmail/.
The duplicates go into a separate folder, but can be dumped in
/dev/null as well.

Unsure how to do this through GMail filters. If you do figure out,
please post the solution.

HTH,
Sameer

IITM is starting Research Park to incubate start ups.  I believe it is
open to all innovators in the Technoloyg/Enggs. sector not just IT.

Perhaps Bharathi Subramaniam or other ILUG members who are regulars @
IITM can give more info.

Besides all the good things that Girish has mentioned, you should ask
yourself the question how much of your own money are you willing to
put into your venture?

Unless, your idea is "earth shattering" (so to speak), most Angel
Funders or Venture Capitalist (Bank of Private institution) will not
be ready to fund your idea.

If I am not mistaken I had attended a meeting at the incubation cell
or some such thing in IITB about a month back.

I don't have the details right now.

We do not have an idea of huge investment.And also setting up the office.We
depend on cloud services like amazon , salesforce or Google AppeEngine.

If you look at the headers(*), you'll see a X-spam-score. Check the average 
scores for what you consider as spam and mention that in your spamassassin 
config (ref: config option - required_score)

Also, you might want to modify the default behavior of spamassassin of just 
setting this header to also modifying the subject line to reflect the spam status

(ref: config option - rewrite_header, for example:

rewrite_header Subject [SPAM]

)

A quick google also showed me this, which might be useful:

(*) I am sorry don't know how to do that in evolution, but in thunderbird it is 
'view->headers->all' or through 'view->message source', I'd imagine there'd be 
something similar in evo.

solved - in preferences the preferred plugin for spam was not selected -
trust our good friends in fedora to leave something out. I selected
spamassassin as default plugin and restarted evolution for good measure
and it has started working.

Please tell me which OS U used for your process. you must give the root

Mostly it will ask password for security purpose, others cannot access

Dear luggies,
On behalf of ILUGC, today (9 Aug 2010), I gave a presentation on Introduction to FOSS in MIT, Chromepet,Chennai on the occasion inauguration of their Computer Society. About 250 students mostly first year, attended the session. This year MIT computer society is planning several activities like -tutorial session, tamil computing etc., and I am sure they will do some good work.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank Prof.Catherine Bina of CS dept, Mr.Vignesh Chairman of the Society, other staff and students for the opportunity.

The best way to run root commands as non-root user is to configure sudo.

Message-ID: <20100809151711.11728.qmail@greenpeace.in>

   Hi,

   Our politicians forget their promises so easily! They vow to keep our
   coasts safe, but do nothing about the fact that over 300 ports are
   proposed to be built on our coast, many in the vicinity of biodiversity
   rich areas.

   Many of these ports will be near mangrove areas, on fertile inter tidal
   mud flats, near the breeding and spawning grounds for turtles, horseshoe
   crabs and other marine creatures. Along with several other organisations,
   Greenpeace is asking the environment minister Jairam Ramesh to keep the
   construction of new ports and expansion of existing ones away from such
   eco-sensitive areas.

   I have already written to the minister asking him to protect our coasts as
   promised. More letters will put more pressure on the minister to act.

   Can you also write to the minister?

   http://greenpeace.in/turtle/no-more-dhamras

   Thanks!

   siva886@gmail.com

   You are receiving this email because someone you know sent it to you from
   the Greenpeace site. Greenpeace retains no information about individuals
   contacted through its site, and will not send you further messages without
   your consent -- although your friends could, of course, send you another
   message.

It was a wonderful session with an audience count crossing 300. As most of
the audience were first year students, I hope its appropriate time for them
to get to know what is Free Software. Thanks to Mr.Raman for presenting such
an awesome introduction to FOSS. With the support from ILUGC we hope to make
more contributions to the Free Software community.

Hi All,
    To view apache server activity, status and performance from a shell
prompt we use lsof, netstat, top, vmstat but experienced lot
more comfortable with mod_status, it provides variety of information about
apache server.

Total number of worker serving requests
Total number of of idle worker
Find the status of each worker, the number of requests that worker has
performed and the total number of bytes served by the worker
Total number byte count served
Other information such as CPU usage, number of requests per second,current
hosts and requests being processed etc.


All these information are generated in html format and displayed.

Hi Selvakumar,

The questions you need to prepare answer are:

1. You have an idea which you think will be useful to a market (for
example, pay electricity bills from mobile phone in Tamil Nadu etc).

What is the idea and which is the target market ?

2. You and your team are good at certain strength which gives you
confidence to think of starting a business. (for example, good
programming skills, experience in running business, "we can convince
any one to buy something from us" etc)

What is your strength?

3. You need money to sustain yourselves and also to promote the
business, even if you use cloud resources. At some point you will look
to get revenues.

What resources you have (computers, internet connection, cash in bank)?
How do you plan to get money from users of your software?

It is good that you started asking questions about your business. Get
a mentor and discuss everything in detail.

Generally, it is a good idea to work in another company to learn
systems and practices before venturing out on your own. But, I also
know some young gentlemen who are entrepreneurs as college  students
and went on to build highly successful ventures right out of college.

All the best.

SFD Participation

Discussion was about Projects in SFD by KanchiLUG at ilugc(Birla
Planitorium) on 18th September.

For Beginners

Installation

Openoffice

GIMP / Inkscape

Ruby, Python, PHP

Glade

Mysql, PostgreSQL

Quickly

For Advanced

Audrino

Multiple os in single dvd

Web Application

Splitting various Musics to Speakers and Headset

Big Blue Button

And Finally,

Kanchilug is having an idea to celebrate SFD in Kanchipuram before on
18 Sept or after one week.

We decided to celebrate SFD in Kanchipuram to give the awareness to
public. We discussed what are all the possibilities to conduct the
SFD. The only thing was cost resource. We estimated the total cost
based on the expenses that would occur and? the expenses would be
approximately 7500 Rupees for SFD in Kanchipuram. KLUG have 1000 as an
initial amount. If We have enough sponsors from someone who supports
us for the SFD to be celebrated in Kanchipuram, it will be possible to
conduct it in this year. Possibly we expect that we will get
sponsors.Otherwise, we?look forward to celebrate it in the next year
at our own cost.

Instead of lumping 2 to 3 questions together, you should ask them
seperately so that everyone understands it the first time they read
your email query.

I'll try and answer your questions to the extent I understand the
implementation of Clouds...

As far as I know most of the clouds today are commercial, but some of
them might provide free usage till you reach your quota(Storage,
bandwidth etc) like in GAE.

There are tons of material on Eucalyptus, specifically on how to set
things up, if you Google it.

Most of the open source tools provide for consuming different cloud
services and not so much for implementing a cloud.

Hi
>> i want to know about lamp , is it necessary to study in institutions ,
how
You no need to go for any institution if you have internet connection in
your home you can learn it. by googling it you can learn and master it.
>> can we selfstudy send me some details regarding this
For self studies,
At first choose which language you are going to choose, because LAMP stands
for Linux Apache Mysql and PHP/Python/Perl so first choose anything from
this 3 lang,
For installing LAMP, follow this link
http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_lamp_for_newbies
or
execute this command,
sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-client-5.0 mysql-server-5.0
phpmyadmin libapache2-mod-php5 libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql

next learning information,
Just goto google and type "getting started in LAMP"
if u choosed the php then my recommendation is goto w3schools php
all the best

Please read the sentence as "There are not that many tools/frameworks
for building clouds as there are for consuming services built on
clouds". Now does that make sense?

It is not one month, we will be having preparatory meets. We are short of
time, and from my own experience, to put up a show, it needs planning.
We have made arrangement with mentors(like some senior members of ilugc
,experts in foss) , Volunteers can work in tandem with  mentors in bringing
up exhibits..

IMHO, XAMPP (an integrated LAMP package) would be much easier to install. It
also provides phpMyAdmin - a web interface for maintaining databases. For a
beginner it would be much easier.
It can be downloaded freely at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Linux/1.7.3a/xampp-linux-1.7.3a.tar.gz/downloadand
many others.

PS: Even some hosting services provide this phpMyAdmin interface (I'm using
the feature in Dreamhost).

Subject: [Ilugc] repeating Virus on pen-drive
Message-ID: <AANLkTimhUpD276tHyRKdvWnHb39B=8Amkj7pqsBWWgfX@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I had attached my pen-drive to a windows system, which led to loading of a
virus that creates a exe file in every folder that you open. Now to get rid
of that, I tried deleting the virus from my fedora system, however it just
won't go, and moreover it changes the access mode of the pen-drive to read
only on every delete attempt. I had tried this before and it worked, but
this time it is something different. Maybe the issue is specific to
pen-drives, because last time I tried this on a portable hard disk with
ntfs.

I have tried overwriting the exe files using the dd command (find -name *\
.exe ./ -exec dd -if=/dev/zero or some text file of={} bs=512 count=some
count enough to override the file size \;) to get rid of whatever code is in
the virus.

After running the above command, ls -l does shows the new attributes of the
file in terms of size and modified date etc, however again when I delete the
file, the original attributes are restored.

Then I tried formatting it, however after a certain point the format fails,
because again the access mode changes to read only mode.

I then tried overwriting the whole disk with the dd -if=/dev/zero, but that
fails too after certain point for the same reason.

Now the pen-drive is in a state that even when I attach it to windows, it is
accessed in read-only mode and am unable to do anything except for read the
data from it.

I will send in more details from the logs once I get back to my system.
Until then, if anyone has any pointers, please let me know.

Regards,
Ashish

p.s the AVG anti-virus also was not able to delete that virus.

I really don't want a virus related mail in LUG. ;)

Just kidding.

Why make a fuss of it at all?

I don't see a problem.

Try mounting as superuser. Do not allow normal udev to mount. Just try deleting using find as superuser, I had success in such cases.

Yes,These applications are installable for high memory phones.Some of
the phones restrict the size of the jar file to install.So large jar
files will not install (if we built a offline map the memory will be
high).

I am interested in develop such application to access the map using
GPRS or 3g,like Google maps as a final year project.
Is it useful for the people?

I ran the commands as su. I had even mounted it as su with and without the
noexec mode, just in case there was something going on behind the scene. In
normal tty (non gui tty) udev does not mount by default, so I had run the
mount command, but still no success.

I agree, Its not the best thing to be talked about in a linux forum, but
then this is a unique and engrossing scenario which makes one think of ways
that files could stored on a filesystem, such that even overwriting a
location using 'dd' did not overwrite the actual file.

I am sure there is something special to be learnt here, because as per my
knowledge dd is supposed to be overwriting blocks directly on the location
specified, then howcome upon deleting the file after overwriting, the
original file is restored, and what's making the drive to change to readonly
mode. I am just trying to understand these points.

And moreover if I take this drive to the markets like Nehru place in delhi
and Burma bazar in Chennai, they will be able to format it in no time. Like
they did for my memory card, that was not even detectable on my system or
phone (dmesg indicated finding a new device, however was able to assign a
device file for the same, for which I had once written a mail).

after some years of experimentation, I find a setting of 3.5 on
spamassassin along with some training eliminates 99% of spam - and very
rarely catches non spam.

Now this is an interesting problem. It does not seem logical that a Win virus can cause this. There are a couple of possibilities -
1. The virus is at a lower level than 'autorun' - extremely unlikely.
2. My guess is that the drive itself is faulty - not easy to verify.
3. Something else which I can't begin to understand.

Try googling to see how you can 'reset' flash drives. We could wave strong magnets over previous generation of hard disks - is there something equivalent for flash drives?

Thanks,
kc

Dear luggies,

both of them have login forms, the workflow is that if i click a link in

i face is session, when it opens the second app the session in the first is

I have fixed this issue.

simple, before starting the session in app2, i assigned a new name for it.

session_name('new_session');
session_start();

it gave me new session to second apps.

I once experienced this issue. Whenever I tried to mount that pendrive, 
it mounted as read-only because of corrupted filesystem.

A full 'dd' to whipe the whole drive, then making it usable(gparted?) 
may work.

Dear all,

On behalf of ILUGC, myself conducted a one day awareness program on FOSS in
Sengunthar College of Engineering (www.scew.org) on 09/08/10 for the final year
CSE, IT and MCA students totalling 180+.

Sengunthar Engineering College (www.scteng.co.in) On 10/08/10 for the Third year
CSE Students totalling 105+.

FOSS lab was setup in both the colleges using Fedora-13 (this time, we installed
about 4200+ packages in all the machines using kickstart).

Also distributed few copies of Fedora, OpenSuSE, Ubuntu, Edubuntu DVDs
to the students.

Topics covered:

Why Free / Open Source Software so important in engineering education
Ubuntu 10.04 installation from DVD
Introduction to office, internet, multimedia, development tools in
FOSS (in Fedora-13)

I would like to thank the Director, Principal, HODs of CSE/IT/MCA for
the support in organizing the
program.

I have faced similar situation in the past and what has worked for me is
1. Format the pen drive using (c)fdisk
2. Create the partition again
3. Create the file system using mkfs.vfat

It is a part of layered stack which consists of various things like
MRG, Directory server, HA componant, KVM (of course!) and the such.

RHEV is a bunch of management tools.

A quick query. How do I format an already formatted NTFS drive to RAW state so that I could use that partition exclusively for installing Fedora?

?	My friend formatted new my hard drive to C,D,E,F,G partitions in NTFS & installed Windows XP.
?	I would want to install Fedora on my empty NTFS partition F: - How do I go about it?

Regards
N Deepak.

Delete the partition corresponding to F drive during Fedora
installation and select it to install Fedora. Create partitions out of
the resulting space as needed.

boot with fedora install cd. When partitioning the drive menu comes
choose custom partitioning. Select the partition, delete it and then
partition it as you wish. It can all be done using the gui - which is
all you need unless you are an expert in using fdisk.

Unfortunately a lot of people use spamassassin.

The issue is with false positives and slowness.

I have never used it but.

It is a statistically trained system to determine weather a mail content is
spam or non spam.
I think it is having a bootstrat facility to learn new spam mails too.
It may be the reason of its slow performance.

this can be adjusted - after training is over, there are many ways of
speeding it up and manually adjusting the rules.

Is there an application that can monitor network traffic & route traffic from a particular application to a given proxy? Say, for instance, mplayer is trying to access a website & I'd want to route this traffic over some proxy abc.com, is this possible?

My suggestion would be instead of celebrating separately at your
college you can put a stall at Birla planetarium.

So, my current development environment is Linux. It is a Ruby-on-Rails
application maintained in svn repository with MySQL backend. We also use git
through git-svn bridge. 

I need to be in Windows 7 for other reasons and I want the command-line
goodness to be with me in Windows as well. I tried Cygwin, but ruby on
Cygwin is a bit slower than native ruby.

I haven't tried andLinux, but I'll try it today to see if it is any better.

The other options I've found is using a Linux VM through VMWare/VirtualBox.
I don't want to do this as a personal preference. But I'm keeping this as a
last option.

Is there any other way? Anybody used andLinux before? Is it better than
Cygwin?

Message-ID: <AANLkTikTq=n2g3+D6M45=T9VdAVOR6+p6BYCjqeTj-j7@mail.gmail.com>

Application: HTTrack

What it is:

HTTrack is a free <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>
(GPL<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt>,
libre/free software) and easy-to-use offline browser utility.

It allows you to download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a local
directory, building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images, and
other files from the server to your computer. HTTrack arranges the original
site's relative link-structure. Simply open a page of the "mirrored" website
in your browser, and you can browse the site from link to link, as if you
were viewing it online. HTTrack can also update an existing mirrored site,
and resume interrupted downloads. HTTrack is fully configurable, and has an
integrated help system.

To install in Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo apt-get install httrack

If possible, set up another email account (gmail, yahoo mail,
rediffmail) for the mailing lists. That will eliminate this
unnecessary footer in your mails to the list.

The above quotation appears as though I (arun khan) had asked the
query about RHEV whereas it was *you* who had asked about it.

I know the bits and pieces of RHEV, Redhat had held a day long virtual
seminar on the product launch;  I am glad you found out about it.

I have not gone that deep. 3.4 is too low and some things get marked as

I use andLinux for more 2 years (may be more) now but not for coding.
I use it for log analysis (grep and other useful linux/unix
utilities).
Before that I used GNU Win32  + Console (third party alternative to
CMD) - this was was slow.
for the purpose I use, i am extremely happy with andLinux

Also I don't use andLinux Console but ssh to it with putty.
So I can copy/paste between the command line and my (unfortunately)
Windows desktop.

For ubuntu,

http://www.playdeb.net/updates/ubuntu/all/#how_to_install

Then install the OAD game just click the "install" button from the following
link.

http://www.playdeb.net/software/0%20A.D.

not many colleges may have persons/resources/materials to set up stall. they
could provide volunteers to support the stalls set up by others.

the suggestion could be "apart from celebrating at your college, join us at
Birla planetarium".

those who could organize lectures / demos effectively in their own colleges
could go ahead with their "celebrations" and also send a few of their
members to join the Birla Planetarium fest.

other colleges  could organize a brief session prior to the event (say
during 10 - 16 sep) to create an awareness about FOSS and Software Freedom
Day, and invite the students to Birla planetarium events (slogan such as
:"Be Free and Be at Birla" ?)

Hi,

I had created a symbolic link to a folder.
I deleted the link and with it all the files under the source were 
deleted too.

I am using Ubuntu 10.04.
Issued a 'sudo rm link-name' from the shell.

Is there anyway to recover the lost files??

sudo rm link-name  -  won't be a problem.

sudo rm link-name/ - deletes the underlying directory.

...and that's the reason why 'unlink' exists. You are unambiguous that way.

Anyways, to be pedantic, 'rm' by itself will not remove a directory or a link to 
a directory (when specified as link-name/) unless the directory is empty. Also, 
sudo is not required unless the logged in user doesn't have the correct 
permissions (ie: write permission on the containing directory).

cheers,

Interesting. On my computer this returns the error "Not a directory".
However,

    rm link-name/*

works as expected and deletes everything after following the link.

But this happens only when the directory is empty. How did the files inside
the directory got deleted? is there some kind of alias that replaced 'rm'
with 'rm -r' in your system?

I was giving an example when someone asked how can deleting a link 
deletes the actual folder. Not a working code. apologies. Obviously,

yes- sudo is not required always
yes- -r is required to delete a non-empty directory. And,
yes-  adding a star at the end will delete the contents and won't delete 
the directory
yes- if you try it in your system, it might not behave as expected.

wget does not rewrite URLs in the pages. So, if your website is at
example.com and you link to example.com/image.png then `wget -r` won't
rewrite that to make the downloaded page function.

IIRC, programs like HTTrack do this.

Yes, that's exactly what I did.
Yet, shouldn't it have deleted sym-links under the link-name.
Is it because, I linked a directory instead of linking individual files?

When I tried 'rm -r link-name' that returned 'Not a directory'.
However it did not complain when i did 'sudo rm link-name/'.

BTW, I use bash, what do you use?

I tried Scalpel.
I panicked and ran Scalpel (without understanding how it works, of 
course!) and my Ubuntu virtual box ran out of space.
I logged out (hoping to add more space) and was never able to login again.

I think it's useless trying to recover files now, as Scalpel's own 
output would have over written what ever blocks that it was suppose to 
carve files out of.

Export those values as values for the environmental variable
$CATALINA_OPTS in your bash_profile and source it. Then it will work.
These paramters are supposed to be passed to JVM not to bash. Bash
does not understand them.

here is my problem, i was working on a mac before migrating to windows

drive formatted on the mac, now the hdd crashed! :(
i managed to find some applications that recover mac drives (Stellar
phoenix) on the windows platform, but could not locate anything for the
linux platform. There is ddrescue - but from my understanding, it works
for internal hdds and cds to read bad sectors.

any suggestions will be welcome, because i hve some important info that
i would like to recover. 


thanks.

Subject: [Ilugc] weird boot error in mandriva
Message-ID: <1281683556.1907.189.camel@localhost>

hi,

have a fairly aged machine which could only take mandriva 2009 (fedora
and latest mandriva do not install). It was running fine. Now it was
decided to make it a server, so an extra lan card was put in. Boots,
mandriva flash screen appears, progress bar at the bottom reaches about
3/4th of the way and then nothing happens. Multicoloured patches appear,
for example, where the mouse cursor should be we get a multicoloured
square that does not move. Once or twice it booted, kde came up and I
was able to use the machine. The new lan card was detected ok.

after a day or two it used to reach that stage and hang. I tried safe
mode and it worked perfectly giving the full kde screen at good
resolution. So it is not a grahics card problem.

so I tried again. it hung. there is no reset button, so I just tried
ctrl-alt-delete - and hey presto - the kde login screen came up and it
worked perfectly after that. Any clues about what on earth is going on?

Instead of yet another distro, try out a Linux Appliance, that does something

Choose the Name & kind of Service you are going to offer.

Look at: http://msmeonline.tn.gov.in/index.php

File Form I, under Online Filing, If you are yet to start up. (Choose Computer
Related Service)

File Form II, under Online Filing, If you have already started.

You need to send a copy of it to concerned authority, signed.

The same can be done at District Collector offices (am i right?) across the
State, physically. 

Most Nationalised Banks & few private Banks like CUB, KVB gives you a current
account at Rs 3,000 minimum balance. Do you need reference?

You are a Proprietor now, if you have chosen to do it alone. 

Apply for a PAN. You can do it online too.
http://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/pan/overview.asp

To my knowledge, for Proprietorship, individual's PAN is sufficient.

Is you estimate the Business is going to be below 10,00,000 during the first one
year do not, bother about taxes.

Keep going till 9,99,999.

PS: Unfortunately most of the links that I have provided above works successfully
in IE only ;-)

If I get it right, msi files are installer files. I doubt there will
be anything to do opening them! on the other hand, they might work
with wine kind of emulator. I haven't used them in linux myself,
though.

MSI stands for Microsoft Installer files and they won't work on Linux.  
Let's step up a bit.  What are you trying to do with those MSI files?

Have you tried using vpnc. Its a cisco client i guess. Its the easiest
solution as far as I have tried. It installs a file in etc dir, in which you
can set parameters using the .pcf file.

One of my client just called me to arrange some open source system for him
which will help him to manage some points of an organisation ( where he is
working ).

He needs some open source solution which will:

1. Manage an academic calendar.
2. Manage a complete profile of each and every students of that
organisation.

Is there anything for such work? By the way, I am hunting for more clues (
his organisation`s needs ) which will help us to find exact open source
system. I am going to let you know as I become more concerned.

If you are prepared to wrestle with opengroupware, Let it be. It is
the best under the conditions:

1. You have some sort of directory sever properly installed and
configured for authorisation and authentication.
2. better still have kerberos. It simplifies the matter of AFS.

Here is my summary,

First of all i was astonished to see a good crowd in this meet, When i went
in there Mr. Chandrashekar Babu was introducing ruby programming language to
the attendees. He compared the features of perl,shell scripts, python with
ruby. He very much emphasised the readability of the ruby language.Then he
spoke about the garbage collection techniques used by the ruby interpretor
(reference count garbage collection) . I request him to share the examples
with the list members. Some examples include threading, sockets, number
crunching , string processing, freezing an object etc.

Then Mr.Suki Venkat of TNQ Publications spoke about MuLTiFlow, a XUL based
the text editor  for scientific and technical writing. Multiflow supports
SVG  and math symbols. The editor is packaged as a  xpi file (firefox add-on
). You can also run MuLTiFlow as a standalone application by extracting the
xpi file and running the following command 'xulrunner application.ini'. The
whole editor is a javascript hack by Mr.Suki and his team.

Then we discussed about SFD, the number of stalls, volunteers etc. Mr.
M.Sivakumar wanted to spread the news about SFD to the common public, so he
and couple of folks have agreed to volunteer for the media and social media
promotion. It was almost dark when the meet got over.

Yes. Paste buffer.

You can use the Xwindow utilities xsel, xcutsel and xclipboard

But I love xsel best.

For those of you who have been following LUG you would have seen my
perl randtype script.

I wrote in shell and python too.

$ cat randtype.sh

lines=`wc -l /etc/passwd | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f2`
lineno=1
while [ $lineno -ne $lines ];
do
        lineno=`expr $lineno + 1`
        line=`sed -n ${lineno}p /etc/passwd`
        charsinline=`echo $line | wc -c | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f2`
        charcnt=1
        while [ $charcnt -ne $charsinline ];
        do
                chartoprint=`echo -n $line | cut -c${charcnt}`
                echo -n "$chartoprint"
                sleep 0.12
                charcnt=`expr $charcnt + 1`
        done
        echo
done

$ cat randtype.py

import time
import os
import sys

f=open("/etc/passwd")
lines=f.readlines()

sys.stdout = os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno(), 'w', 0)
for line in lines:
# First indentation level
        for char in line:
        # indent all following lines with a tab
                 time.sleep(0.02)
                 #print "slept"
                 sys.stdout.write(char)

Way too complicated! Here's a simplified version of the script:

-----8<----- cut below ------8<--------------------------
#!/bin/bash
SIZE=$(stat -c "%s" $1)
for ((i=0; i<SIZE; i++))
do
    read -n1 CHAR
    test -z "$CHAR" && echo || echo -n "$CHAR"
    sleep 0.1
done < $1
------8<----- cut till above line ----8<----------------

Save as slowtype.sh and make it executable. Run as below:
  ./slowtype.sh /etc/passwd

The above code is completely non-pythonic (looks like a
C program written in python!). The following code must be
succinct and simpler enough:

------------ 8<------- cut below --------- 8<-----------------
#!/usr/bin/env python
import time
import sys

for char in sys.stdin.read():
    sys.stdout.write(char)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    time.sleep(0.1)
---------- 8<------- cut till above ------ 8<------------------

Save the above script as slowtype.py and make it executable.
Run the script as below:
   ./slowtype.py < /etc/passwd

The same code in ruby would be something like below (even
simpler versions could be possible):

--------- 8<-------- cut below ------- 8<----------------------
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
STDIN.read.each_char do |c|
    STDOUT.write c
    STDOUT.flush
    sleep 0.1
end
--------- 8<------ cut till above -------- 8<-------------------

Save the above script as slowtype.rb and make it executable.
Run the script as below:
    ./slowtype.rb < /etc/passwd

Chandrashekar.

It's just having too many features. such as booking of resources like
classrooms, LCD projectors and the such, Project planning, file share
area and many, many such. IIRC there is a variant phpgroupware.

To configure them all and get them going could take a while though.

OTOH if you are interested in call logging system try glpi and its
tightly integrated cousin OCSInventory.

If at all I have done something to opengroupware it has been botching it up :D

Excellent summary report!
The translation is very much appreciated as this will definitely
reach out to people conversant with Tamil. I think we must
encourage more translators to translate and summarize tech
talks in local languages like this.

Keep up the great work Ma. Sivakumar!

File uploads seem to be broken on my website for now. But
I managed to have the scripts posted on pages of my
website - all list members can access the same from the
the link below:
   http://www.chandrashekar.info/vault/ruby-scripts.html

CAUTION: Most scripts are not perfect in implementation. Some
scripts are buggy and/or incomplete. Most pages lack proper
formatting for now. Nevertheless, I hope it should be useful
enough to understand the concepts.

I'll fix most of the pending issues when I get enough time.

Thank you all for your interest, participation and support!

Regards,
Chandrashekar.

I get your point: :)

On Debian / Debian-based systems:

sudo apt-get install qutecom

On RH based systems:

yum install qutecom

Hi,

I'm part of the team that created the book. Please let me know if
there's something you'd like modified or added to that. I'm happy that
you like it.

Thank You

Subject: [Ilugc] CDAC BOSS Team interactions with some ILUG-C members (on
	12th aug)
Message-ID: <AANLkTikmRzhRBb7yPLF9c5mijzrWPC8hU1ugSFM0rjCb@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends:
I had invited a few of the ILUGC members for an interaction session with
BOSS Team at CDAC Chennai and the meeting was held yesterday (thursday 12th
aug 2010) 4:00 p.m.

My basic objective was to expose my colleagues to the favor of LUG members
(their expertise and experience) and expose the LUG team as to what is
happening at BOSS centre ; discuss briefly about BOSS 4.0 development /
testing and ways to broadbase the community involvement.

I thank the members * who visited us and shared their views, and gave their
valuable suggestions.
[* Ma Sivakumar, Raji Seetharaman, Raman, Srinivasan, Sri Ramadoss &
Vijayakumar  -- have i got the list right?]

Queries/Suggestions/
Discussions during the meeting:
?? BOSS Download : packages & source, and user manual could be downloaded
from bosslinux portal
?? BOSS content vis-a-vis Debian/Ubuntu, etc. : suitable documentations are
in the offing ; inputs from BOSS team and from agencies we interact with
will be suitably demarcated in the repository (to enable
testing/adaptation/enhancement)
?? BOSS repository, access to portal, etc.: after shifting to the new
premises (at TIDEL Park), the setup and portal revamp is on to enable
external access (initially with commit restricted to inhouse group). Some
wiki pages, tracking mechanisms are being activated. The version control
(subversion) mechanism currently active in a limited manner is being
reworked.

** NRCFOSS portal (http://nrcfoss.org.in) redesigned to include pages on
FOSS packages, resource persons, etc.
** Student projects : the portal could provide a platform for project
related interactions & uploads. The colleges could be asked to take the
responsibility of monitoring the students while CDAC/NRCFOSS could provide
the organizational stamp (issuing certificates) and enable community experts
to contribute.
[The LUG members also participated in the discussion we were having with a
set of Professors from Colleges -- inviting the colleges to come up with
suggestions for a committed plan of action]
** Involvement of BOSS team in LUG activities : some members are already in
the LUG ; a few of the BOSS team members (e.g., from Bengaluru - Open
Office, Mumbai - Orca) are part of the FOSS groups related to the packages
they work on ; sharing queries/responses, participation in LUG events,
etc.,  will be taken up

I hope this will kindle more cohesive interactions with useful
contributions/responses from NRCFOSS/BOSS team.

thanks and best wishes
Srinivasan.

dear friends :
am adding some brief info about BOSS and allied activities at CDAC.
Srinivasan.
NRCFOSS/BOSS
CDAC.
---------------

A brief note on BOSS and related activities:

 As part of NRCFOSS project CDAC Chennai had brought out Bharat Operating
System Solutions (BOSS),-- BOSS GNU/Linux -- derived from Debian with some
add on packages such as Bulk Document Converter, Presentation Tool, apart
from a suitable version of grub installer. EduBOSS, an educational variant
(including the EduBOSS Tamil released at Semmozhi Maanadu) and a server
version have also been generated. BOSS DVDs have been distributed and a Help
Desk facility has been set up to respond to queries, besides access to BOSS
portal : http://bosslinux.in (includes discussion forum, faq, download,
etc.). We expect to release BOSS 4.0 in a couple of months.

With the help of BOSS Support Team (at various CDAC Centres across the
country), the interactions have been on with various agencies, primarily
govt departments (as one could understand). Tieups with agencies like NIC,
ELCOT have been taken up -- some of the active measures include : BOSS
installations at Palakkad Dist to run land record system (supporting the NIC
team); CHIPS, Chattisgarh ; installation at ISRO & NIC Bengaluru ; training
& installation for some of the Navy units ; training and support for BSNL
Hyderabad ; installation in various schools in Punjab under Sarva Shiksha
Abhigyan program, etc. Under BOSS Vendor Certification Program, BOSS
Compliance Certificates are issued to systems / devices working on BOSS
platform.

The initial efforts had been more on creating awareness, especially amongst
govt and allied agencies as a fellow govt body, and responding to deployment
related queries from agencies / users who were willing to use the BOSS
platform. Some workshops have been organized and BOSS team also visits
potential user institutions (e.g., govt depts, agencies, etc.) for
presentations and interactions.


 As the acceptance of Linux and FOSS has grown considerably, now the focus
should be more on applications that run on the platform, availability of
device drivers, etc. -- i.e. FOSS promotion and deployment.

http://nrcfoss.org.in main NRCFOSS portal

and allied pages such as:

developed/deployed in India)

info on FOSS resource persons (info invited from community), news, etc.

We accept KG is a genius. Please you dont imitate any one in the list.
If some body made mistakes means, point out their mistake just one time.

You just always trying to prove (or make yourself popular) by replying like
you are worked in debian and other distros.

Hope you understand my point.

my point is very simple - there are a few hundred distros available.
Each of them has it's own way of installing things. 'sudo apt-get' is
the Ubuntu way of installing - so if someone says 'to install use sudo
apt-get' it implies that there is only one distro. This is annoying -
everyone has their favourite distro, and nothing wrong with being
passionate (or even fanatical) about it. So all that needs to be done is
to say 'to install in ubuntu use sudo apt-get'. Another point is that
packages are named differently in different distros. Fedora may have the
package named 'xyz' whereas debian may call it 'libxyz'.

as for distros, I use only three. Fedora on laptop, mandriva for wife
and kids and debian for servers. How this will make me popular, I do not
understand when most people I know have at least 10 distros on their
machines.

Hi Thyagarajan,

As Dr Srinivasan wrote in his summary, access to source code of BOSS
project was discussed during the interaction.

As I understood,

1. The project derives from Debian and focusses on providing
localization in Indian languages, driver support for devices used by
Government departments and porting applications used by Government
departments.

2. There was not much clarity or focus on having community facing
initiatives in the initial years.

3. They have worked with various state and central government
departments to support FOSS installations (including Army, Navy,
Punjab government, Kerala government)

4. Now there is a stable team and efforts are on to share the work
with wider FOSS community.

The simple answer to your query is not available right now. Hope that
with more interaction by BOSS team members (who are in this mailing
list) and efforts towards sharing the work, these issues will be
resolved soon.

Best regards

Ma Sivakumar

Sorry if I am blunt, is it means that it is not  an open source software as
of now?..

 Again I am repeating this.

 Please you dont imitate any one in the list.
 If some body made mistakes means, point out their mistake just one
 time.

depends on your definition of open source. Source code is available
somewhere or the other. Although I am not sure if all the Indian
language stuff is open sourced. In terms of methodology and community
involvement, it has not yet succeeded in following the open source
model. But they are trying ...

Hi,


> depends on your definition of open source.



   - The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
   - The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do
   what you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for
   this.
   - The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
   (freedom 2).
   - The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
   (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to
   benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for
   this.


 I am talking my definition of open source with respect to freedom 1 which
the free and open source freedoms promises.

As pointed out by KG, the sources are available (not restricted by any
licence).

Where they are available?
To whom they are available?

should be answered and facilitated.

The facts are:

1. There is a BOSS team in CDAC.
2. The team is working on FOSS
3. Government of India is funding the efforts

Now, how best to get these efforts to the larger community? Helping
those who take the initiative is the way.

Everyone have their style of communicating. This is the KG way and
many in the list enjoy the style.

One needs positive karma to suggest rules to list members. In my
opinion, Mr Victor Johnson, you do not have that.

The source for all the distributions of  BOSS is available at
packages.bosslinux.in/boss.

 The source is available for everyone, anyone can download it from there.

As of now , we dont have a mechanism for people to contribute. But we are
working on it and soon a mechanism will be put up where people will be able
to contribute.

That can be an exercise for a student in LUG. I see source directory
and a lot of code in the link given.

The How To can be contributed to the BOSS project for others to use.

Would be happy to know from the relevant authorities that ,is downloading
and building it from sources is possible or NOT.
As i learn from shiva's reply , that it is not possible to build it from
sources, as of now. However, would be glad to get the official version.

Hi, Thyagarajan,

Why not try emailing the BOSS team or, at the least, asking on the BOSS
Linux forums <http://forums.bosslinux.in/>. It is meaningless to ask the
relevant authorities to contact you. They may not even be aware that you
are asking unless you contact them yourself.

Hi Thyagarajan,

BOSS is not an application to compile it from source/scratch. BOSS is an
operating system, it has a kernel, applications like pidgin/open office/vlc
etc. What i believe BOSS guys are doing is, packaging these applications and
releasing it as an operating system.

If you want to see the source code of vlc and compile it from scratch/source
you can very well do it from the resources available at
http://packages.bosslinux.in/boss/pool/savir/main/v/vlc/

What BOSS folks don't have is a public account,package,build,update system
where people can contribute. In Fedora we have these infrastructure
installed and ready for people's  contribution. I hope BOSS folks build this
infrastructure soon to enable community contribution.

Sure, you point is well received and noted. The same question  was discussed
on ilug delhi mailing list, whose url i have provided earlier.
There were couple of mails on boss , just thought to get my queries

Thanks for the note, would it be possible for you to provide the

Document Converter, Presentation Tool and, the grub ?

thank you arun for putting things in perspective.
let me also use this msg to comment on roshan's response to thyagu:
" since some of us from boss team are in the ILUGC list, and this thread has
been started by me as part of our interaction/community building exercise,
thyagu has reason to expect that the response to his query could come thru
this channel".

Oh absolutely. In fact, another email reveals that people working on
BOSS are actually present on this list. That renders what I said
pointless. Best to safely ignore.

imitate? I honestly do not understand whom KG is imitating. Anyways my two
cents:
  1. KG is helping people know how other distros behave and also laymen
Debian users who may have difficulty
      by following OP's procedure. I learnt, on a previous occasion, that
Debian doesn't have sudo by default from KG only.

  2. And it is funny that you are telling someone about mailing list
etiquette.

Wait, how am I getting your mails? I remember asking my spam filter to eat
them after you sent annoying spams.
Hmmm, I see it now. Wasn't <victor.lists at
gmail.com<http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/options/ilugc/victor.lists--at--gmail.com>>
your original email id? At least thats what my spam filter says me. Please
do not change handles like this to escape your past karma. I cannot keep on
adding new mail ids to my filter whenever you create new ones to annoy
people.

Subject: [Ilugc] Install Package dependencies separately over Cloud
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=M=o2itivd7Ufzwat+6_X3Gmf+eZij+tdNbtxz@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am working on a project that sets up packages on the cloud.

For example, If i want to setup Drupal, i need seperate machines to
maintain separate tasks,
like mysql in one machine(cloud instance/node 1), apache server in another
machine(cloud instance/node 2), etc.

So if drupal.rpm has dependencies apache.rpm(has deps too) and mysql.rpm(has
deps too)

Is it possible in rpm package manager(yum) to handle such customizations &
above requirement?

please suggest any other way to implement the same.

The reason for that was SFD, but we spent very little time discussing it 
(and that too in a great hurry)!
IMHO, I felt we should have had the SFD discussion first and then the 
usual talks.

What KG is doing is lot better than what you did (spamming the list in 
foreign languages **and** having the language tags all wrong!).
After all KG has a point. Different distros have different package 
managers and providing a command that works only on Ubuntu is quite 
misleading.

@OP: You are doing a great job, kindly make a note of this!

Ahem, couldn't find the karma points on ilugc sites.

Did you try http://127.0.0.1/index.php?show=aboutlib ? AFAICT this is host 
lookup problem. It helps to understand all the events that occur between typing 
something in the location box of the browser and a page being displayed. I 
started explaining this whole thing, but it just got too lengthy. So, instead 
i'll encourage you to find the answer yourself, using these hints - what happens 
when you execute:

$ ping 127.0.0.1
$ ping localhost
$ ping 192.168.1.235

$ host 127.0.0.1
$ host localhost
$ host 192.168.1.235

$ GET 127.0.0.1
$ GET localhost
$ GET 192.168.1.235

If you have questions after this, please ask, I'll probably feel more inclined 
to answer in depth then :)

hth,
cheers,

Interesting question. Guess many would have already done this. But
could not find much information using google.

One idea which comes to mind is to

1. install drupal.rpm, apache.rpm and mysql.rpm in the webserver
taking care of all dependencies.

2. Install mysql in database server.

3. Configure the db access script of drupal to connect to database
server via tcp/ip

Have not done this myself.

One thing which comes to my mind is to write a yum plugin. which will do
the above said task in the other node. 

The plugin should look something like this
1. Will check for a config file which will tell about the dependencies
of the particular package installed. It can also include the
machine/node to be installed.
2. Use some ssh module like paramiko to connect to the remote machine
and call the appropriate yum command.

While typing this I also realize that the same can be done by creating a
wrapper rpm for drupal which will include drupal as a dependency and the
post install will do the tasks mentioned for the plugin. In this
approach you need not have to have a config file but somewhere in the
environment you need to have the other hostnames which can be used by
the rpm post install. If you would want to generalize this approach you
can probably write a framework which will create rpm spec files for such
wrapper. 

Rgds,
Siva.

Debian uses this approach extensively.  Such packages are called
meta-packages -- they do not contain any files, but just create
dependencies on other packages.  The gnome-desktop-environment
package is a good example.

I do not understand - from what I know of cloud, the existence of
separate machines and where they are is irrelevant.

@Dastha: please mention the distro which you tested these command with..

for example:

in Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install openshot

you may consider finding the equivalents for the  other popular distros and
add up in your OAOD series.
Good work pal.

Dear Dastha Gheer

Please consider adding some text on equivalent commands for
a few other distros and make it a footer to your mails.

And thanks a lot for the great work

Hi,

Are the "TSCu_" series of Unicode Tamil fonts available in the Ubuntu
archives (http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/t/ttf-indic-fonts/)
redistributable?
Specifically can they be redistributed even for non-free (closed source and
for charge) applications? By redistribution, I mean adding it into the tar
ball of the application as a resource.

The problem is apache is listening on 127.0.0.1 instead of 192.168.1.250
thats why you are facing this. I have faced this before and solved it.
Look for the line called Listen
If it is only 80 then it listens on all ip available in the machine.
If it has some specific ip then it listens on only that ip. So you
might be facing this problem.

Which version of Ubuntu have you installed? You can reinstall
GRUB/GRUB2 using the Ubuntu Live medium.

Do not worry, You do not have to reinstall ubuntu. You will have to
reinstall grub instead. Firstly, you will need to have the live CD of the
Ubuntu installed in your system.

* If you have ubuntu version *9.04 and lower* (GRUB 1), follow the steps in
Part I of this link from my blog: http://bit.ly/9ZXhlz
* And if you are using *9.10 and above* (GRUB 2), follow this link from
Ubuntu Wiki: http://bit.ly/d1iuLv

I can understand, but the above should help you out. Do let us know if you
need more help.

Oh, don't worry. This is a fairly common problem because of a Windows
bug that doesn't allow it to handle other operating systems. So long as
you have an Ubuntu Live CD, you can save yourself.

Here's a thread on the Ubuntu Forums that should help:
<http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1014708>.

Also, why are you using dial-up? If you're in the city, DSL will be
cheaper.

Good luck,

Imho, Free(Libre) Open Source Software would be a better term to use
than Open Source. You could try demonstrating how easily you can do
the day-to-day regular activities using a Free Software distro. That
could be very useful.

I totally agree with Guru. It is better to use FOSS (Free & OpenSource Software) rather than just telling OpenSource.

You can also present the history of FOSS, how it started, what the term means.

In ubuntu, you have to show the compiz effects (Advanced Graphics Effects).

So that, you can get more attraction from the viewers (friends).

I find this video quite interesting http://blip.tv/file/1137079/ . Perhaps
we should try advocating Free software by revealing errors ;)

Yes, making the people aware of the history is important. If they understand
the noble cause behind Free Software Movement they will really enjoy not
only using Free Software but also making more people aware of it.
However, some people may not be interested in listening to history. As the
audience are your friends, most probably you will have an idea about their
interests. Make sure that it is interesting :-)
As Arulalan said, Compiz effects would be very helpful to grab the attention
of beginners.
All the best! :)

Please reply to the appropriate message in the thread. I was confused when I
read the first few words of the above line, as it seemed as if you were
addressing Ma Sivakumar. Only after reading the contents inside brackets I
was able to know that you are addressing to Victor.

I have added *Listen 8081 *and *Listen 8080 *in /etc/apache2/ports.conf  So,
total number of Listen`s are three there.

*Listen 80

You can use ~/.bashrc file to add commands to change to the directory
that you want.

With gnome-terminal and konsole, these work:

gnome-terminal --working-directory=MYDIR
konsole --workdir MYDIR

I don't know about XTerm though.

Subject: [Ilugc] php application not working
Message-ID: <AANLkTinG-kn_xg3QQBiBEabGh5PE2s9-RzVRjR1AcEkY@mail.gmail.com>

I am using windows seven 64 bit professional, apache httpd 2.2 , php
and mysql (all recently downloaded and installed separately). I had a
APM (apache httpd, PHP, mysql)  application called glpi working fine
for a month. Recently(2 days back) I installed another AMP application
called phpip. Initally i had trouble in getting it working , after
some efforts (instead of custom value for the install , i went with
defaults and ) it started working fine. After getting phpip to work
fine , out of nowhere the glpi application boomed . When i access the
glpi application i am getting the internet explorer page titled page
cannot be displayed (no error code) like the one we get when the
internet connection is lost. The url i try for glpi is

http://192.168.1.34/glpi/

But other AMP application sharing the same resources are working fine.
For example

http://192.168.1.34/phpip/

works fine.
i tried placing the following code in documentroot of the web server
and it shows that everything is fine

<?php phpinfo(); ?>

and access it as http://192.168.1.34/info.php

I am able to see mysql information and other whole lot of information.
So from this file i conclude that php is not crashing , apache httpd
is not crashing , mysql is not crashing. Obliviously windows is not
crashing.

One strange behaviour i noticed was in the error log or access log of
httpd there was no mention of glpi url's , but other application url's
are present in access log. Nothing of importance was found in error.

I am pulling my hair not able to figure out why this application
stopped working suddenly. I had lots of data feed into the application
, i am afraid i might loose the data. Somebody please point out what
might be the potential issue.

Ashwin K.

Thanks Akilan. Do you know how to make widget which can be added with
one click to blogger blogs? We can ask bloggers to add to their blogs
for publicity.

Yes of course, we aren't going to create new one. Ma Si did not mean to
create new logo. He was asking about creating a widget which could be added
to blog in one click instead of above search and manually add it to blog
mechanism.

@Ma Si: It could be done. I'll try to create one.

Open the folder which you want to bookmark (say /home/viky/Videos). Then
click Bookmarks tab and select 'Add Bookmark' or just press Ctrl+D. The

The default settings that are OK for phpip may not be OK for glpi.

Quite easy to verify.  Hopefully you kept a back up copy of whatever
files you changed to make phpip and restore them.

Mirroring public websites is a netiquette gray area. Some don't mind,
some do. Since bandwidth usually costs, it would be prudent to ask

Using sudo is usually a different usecase from using su. sudo allows for
finer access control and provides a logging mechanism.

Hi All,

Please see: http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/77#comment-34278

Can someone please enlighten me on what Mark means by "binary-blob drivers"?
I also don't understand how  making them proprietary makes the OS open
source. I know that FSF doesn't recognize Ubuntu as a FreeLibre Software
since it let's people download and use proprietary drivers. But what they
claim is that "All parts of Ubuntu will always be free, along with the
source code", right?? Or am I not seeing something here??

Thank You,
Yogesh.

"Blobs" are binary only firmware which are used by addon cards/devices.
Eg.  a USB DSL modem may not have internal flash storage to store its
embedded OS/code, and would rely on the host OS (Linux/Windows/etc)
to upload it to the device when it's connected/initialized.

Binary only drivers on the other hand may execute on host CPU as well.
>From a security perspective, binary only drivers are bad as they may have
bugs which can be exploited.  OpenBSD stopped including binary only
drivers or blobs in their source trees many years ago.

See: http://kerneltrap.org/node/6497


> I also don't understand how ?making them proprietary makes the OS open

Binary only drivers and blobs are included in Ubuntu/Debian only when
good quality open source drivers do not exist.

Blobs are not created by the Ubuntu team and they come from the hardware
manufacturers.  Some blobs may be included in the non-free section of
Ubuntu/Debian repository.  If the blob license does not permit 3rd party
redistribution, a dummy package is provided which downloads the actual
binary during the install process.

Message-ID: <AANLkTincfxu0sGZgGGw-Xjk+Vth+h6dZVbRCbb1B7xdZ@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Emacspeak

What it is:

Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow someone who cannot see
to work directly on a UNIX system.

Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs.  Once Emacs is started with Emacspeak
loaded, users get spoken feedback for all actions.  As Emacs can do
everything, they get speech feedback for everything they do.

This package includes speech servers written in Tcl to support the DECtalk
Express and DECtalk MultiVoice speech synthesizers.  For other synthesizers,
look for separate speech server packages such as emacspeak-ss and eflite.

To know more about:

http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/

To install in ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install emacspeak

Thank you so much for the insight. From what I understand, Blobs are here to
stay for a while. Why does this happen? Because there are not enough people
willing to write code for these hardware or is it because each hardware for
which the drivers are written are way too diverse from each other? Is there
a standard for lets say building the basics of a mobile broadband modem? Has
there been any attempt to write a framework for groups of similar[in h/w]
devices? Or am I not making sense here? Just curious.

Thank you, that was very helpful. There seems to be a dearth of "Open"
implementations of these standards.

         As for the ETSI standards, quite a few of them have "Open"
implementations(I would prefer to use the term "free" instead of
"open"). For eg.

http://www.ttcn-3.org/OpenSourceTools.htm

But when we talk about 3gpp specifications, they are normally huge
communication systems like the GSM or UMTS or LTE that involve a lot
of network elements at the infrastructure side. Even if we have free
implementations, not every one will be able to use them because the
costs of the actual boxes they run, on are extremely high. So only
huge companies(we call them "operators") can afford to buy those
boxes. And since they invest a big capital, they prefer to buy it from
companies that have a established track record with these kind of
standards. Unfortunately, we don't have a free software company in
this domain. :(

On the other hand, when we talk about Customer equipments(called CPE)
for these standards, they are much cheaper hardware which could be
bought by anyone, we have free software implementations of, say the
wimax stack(IEEE standards, IEEE 802.16) for eg. May be in the future,
we may have "free" GSM or LTE user equipments. :)

Here we go:
http://hosting.gmodules.com/ig/gadgets/file/108664960353323049895/sfd-ilugc.xml

You can add this gadget in Blogger blogs, iGoogle page, Google sites, Google
documents etc.
Pretty much on all sites that supports Google Gadget API.

I have not hard-coded location and link, so that you can change them if you
want to promote some other SFD event(like in Jaya, for example).
Defaults are 'Birla Planetarium, Chennai' and '
http://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org/2010/Asia/India/Chennai/ilugc'
respectively.

You can change title too. Since every visible portion is made editable,
Tamil Blogs can also utilize this. Just change values in textbox to Tamil
when blogger asks you to change defaults if necessary.

Go to the page in which you can edit page design (in Blogger this is
Dashboard-->Design), click on 'Add Gadget' --> 'Add gadget by URL' and give
the above URL. Some services like blogger will ask you to change default
values and in others you have to change them after adding by selecting Edit
Gadget.

Thanks Akilan. I added to my blog at http://kaniporul.blogspot.com/. A
few suggestions for improvement:

1. Can you have the width also changeable and the image adjusting
itself to the width? I had to adjust the width of right column to
avoid seeing scroll bars in the widget.

2. If possible, provide a script link in the widget itself, clicking
on which the widget can be added to a blog. For example, other
bloggers coming to my blog should be able to add the widget to their
blog by clicking and entering their blog address.  (I remember such a
widget sometime back, do not have the details though :-(

That will be a nice thing to have. Image didn't fit my blog too.. :( but I
don't know how to do that in a correct way. So i took commonly used size.
Can anyone suggest a good way? xml file can be downloaded and code examined.

I invoke the right to be wrong.


How can anybody expect the WAR file to run on command line?

I could be absolutely wrong, but IMHO .WAR file is supposed to be Web ARchive.

I have  written a post about SFD in Tamil. This can be used to send
information to Tamil magazines and news papers (with modifications
where needed.

http://kaniporul.blogspot.com/2010/08/blog-post_20.html

Request someone with good command over English writing to write an
article for sending to English news papers and magazines.

Best regards,

sounds good - slightly 'communistic' though. My only request is to use
the word 'software' instead of 'menporul' - I do not think the
colloquial press and it's readers would be able to appreciate the post
otherwise.

Considering that are wireless drivers with free and open source
firmware, this just seems to be a smoke screen.  Intel used to not allow
redistribution even but they did fix that.

All parts?  That was never true.  The Linux kernel has firmware without
source code for example and the repositories have many more.  The claim
has been slowly diluted to only talking about applications installed by
default.

If you are living anywhere near Madurai, I suggest you get in touch
with GNU/Linux User Group of Thiagarajar College of Engineering, or
GNU/Linux User Group of Madurai and they will be able to help you.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimqMiVOeWMk_WyszhDvj0JDk6CUu8nhmy7KeXX9@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

The SMTP mail protocol was written by a gentleman by name Dave Crocker
long long ago.

And thanks to him we have a spam problem. Thanks to him anyone can
spoof as anyone else.

E-mail address proxying is such a big problem that people no longer
believe the From address.

With all its defects e-mails still have a standing and importance far
more than we can imagine.

Today starting from a leather chappal shop in Parrys to a space
research company in America, everyone uses
e-mail and e-mail constitutes the lifeblood of any business.

That being the case trusting open source tools for mails are a matter
of big surprise.

People scoff at open source as being a hobbyist activity without the
seriousness and elan of pedigree
 and class.

Be as it may, the truth is that jewellery showrooms and corporates
alike do not care as long as they get cost effective
stable solutions.

Jewellery is important since I happened to deploy my first ever mail
server product fully based on open source without a single
line  of code that is closed source today.

It does not matter where I did that. Be it shipping or jewellery or
academics, mails are key.

That is a fact that everyone should know.

Without mails nothing works today. Even courier companies and
ticketing companies rely on mails as though they were
 their very essence of being.

Anyway now the advantage of knowledge is often misunderstood and not
adequately appreciated.

Roundcubemail(http://www.roundcubemail.net) may be hard to configure
and get working but once you achieve it you will never use the
 all too common squirrelmail web interface again.

It supports drag and drop, HTML composing(bad for geeks) and address
books and preview pane and what not.

Outlook users will change their religion to roundcube once they see
it. It is that fantastic.

And it is 100% free and open source. :)

This a just a case in point.

I can go on and on on how knowledge helped me serve a very useful,
critical and important need but suffice it to say that
open source has everything you need and more.

Just that you should invest your time and energy to study and benefit by it.

For that you need the commitment of Tendulkar towards cricket.

Don't be an Ajay Jadeja. Be a Tendulkar...

And you can reap rich rewards if only you shed sweat, blood and tears.

Are you ready? Start now. Why wait? ;)

-Girish

Friends.

Today I was discussing with my friend. His company is pushing the
employees to generate new ideas on various technologies and getting
patent for the ideas. It sells the patent to those who uses the same
idea or process.

Is there any way to prevent those companies to patent my own idea or
thought before I apply for patent?

How can I protect my work from patented by someone?

How can I give my thoughts, ideas, knowledge to public for free with
all freedom, with a protection from patent from someone?

Thanks.

Shrini,

Ideas can't be patented anywhere in the world. There is nothing like "Idea
Patent". But the resulting process, product could be patented.

Shrini,

How can I protect my work from patented by someone?

I forgot to add this...

Though ideas can't be patented but it could be protected via copyrights. To
claim copyrights  there are various ways like publishing it etc. I met a
gentleman,he told me that he put his creative work in to a packed registered
letter and sent to his own address. Once it came home he received it with
the packaged seal and kept it. He claimed that this way tomorrow any dispute
comes he can show it to the courts.

Copyrights dispute could be very costly.I must share this info I was just
reading to our honorable forum members about a genius who was forgotten.

Adam Osborne (a  pioneer in the PC Industry- Father of today's PC and
Laptop?)   and how he lost a legal dispute with Lotus1-2-3 for the
spreadsheet he created.

I salute this forgotten soul and I am surprised he lived (early part of his
life) and died (later part of his life) in Tamil Nadu.

There are multiple forms of prior art that prevents a particular process
from being patented.  If you have ideas, publish them publicly.  This is
called defensive publication

Mr. Rajagopal, you are absolutely correct. A WAR file is a WEB
Archive, and it needs a JEE/J2EE Application server such as Tomcat or
JBOSS or Websphere or Weblogic or SunOne or Jetty to run.

You can NEVER run a WAR from commandline. You need some J2EE Server to run it.


Technical Details:
For a Java program to run from the command line, you need atleast one
Java Class with a MAIN function.

A WAR file is essentially a collection of Java classes . JAR files and
property files (along with CSS, JS and IMG files),  These Java files
do not have a MAIN method. Instead these are invoked by the
"container", which can be any JEE server such as TomCat.

Question:
Why do you want to run UniCorn from command line? You can always run
it as a server and invoke it from the commandline, isn't it? I have
not gone through the source code of Unicorn, since it's open source, I
am sure, you can write your own commandline interface for it.

with regards,
Natarajan.

I was wrong. I went through the architecture. It uses the JEE
framework for it's workflow. Hence, it can not be run from
commandline. you will always need  a small server.

Software freedom

We celebrated Indian Independence day on August 15th. If one asks when
India got independence, all Indians know the answer (I believe they
should know) - 15th of August 1947.

After this independence we have attained the rights and duties in
political and social domains under the constitution we have established.

In the same way do we have freedom in all parts of our lives? After the
20th century revolution in information technology, what is the state of
our rights in the computer domain?

It may be news to many of us that our rights over the software we use
have been snatched away by the profit motive of commercial
organisations.

Since 1980 thinkers worldwide have raised the flag of struggle against
the commercial companies who are trying to increase their capital by
snatching away the rights of users, students and people in the software
domain (does this remind one of the east India company?)

Many experts in the software domain are creating, releasing, exchanging
and improving software that is unfettered, in a manner that respects the
rights of others.

Software freedom day is observed worldwide to celebrate this unfettered
software.

Through this celebration, instances of use of unfettered software
products by the public all over the world in educational institutions,
government offices, homes, offices and all other places are shown.

goal:

To create an environment in the field of information technology where
everyone can freely mix with everyone else, create new products,
exchange products in a free, open united manner.

objectives:

 * To celebrate software freedom and those who work for it
 * to inspire the public to use unfettered software and open standards
and to create a general understanding of software freedom
 * to create opportunities for everyone to get and participate
 * to inspire debates about the rights and duties of the emerging
information based society
 * to act along with organisations and individuals who have this same
goal

software freedom in Chennai

This event that is celebrated worldwide on the 3rd Saturday of September
will take place this year on September the 18th.

1. Enthusiasts from the Chennai chapter of the Indian Linux Users Group
(http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/listinfo/ilugc.tamil) have made
arrangements to conduct this in a grand fashion. Explanations, demos and
discussions of unfettered software products will take place on the 18th
of September at the Birla planetarium in Kotturpuram, Chennai.

2. We are pleased to invite the public, students, reporters, government
employees and computer enthusiasts to participate in the event. To know
about this event look here:
http://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org/2010/Asia/India/Chennai/ilugc

WE WILL BREAK AND THROW AWAY THE FETTERS THAT BIND THE SOFTWARE THAT
RUNS ON OUR COMPUTERS.

WE WILL CREATE A TECHNOLOGICAL SOCIETY WHERE EVERYONE CAN SHARE
INFORMATION.

I believe that this mechanism works in the US but there are legal problems
with this approach in EU member states. The patent laws in the US and EU
differ in how they approach subjects which have been published - in the EU
states, for some classes of products/processes, publishing the idea could
prevent the process/product from being patentable.

But I am not entirely sure about this. So it is best to check with a
patent lawyer. Also now software patents are unenforceable in some
countries in the world.

Dear all,

On behalf of ILUGC, myself conducted a one day awareness program on FOSS in
Karpagam Institute of Technology, Coimbatore (

students totalling 110+.

60 seat FOSS lab was setup in the college using Fedora-13. Also distributed
few copies of Fedora-13, OpenSuSE-11.3, Ubuntu-10.04, Edubuntu-10.04,
LinuxMint-9, Debian-5.0.5 DVDs to the students.

I would like to thank the Principal Dr.T. Ramachandran, Mr. Mohanasundaram,

If you could prove by some means, you did it before someone patented it.

Before granting any patent the Intellectual Property Rights Office, grants time
for stake holders to prevent it.

But practically tracking these are tough.

Patents are sin, eventually everyone has to commit it in today's scenario.

Thanks Balaji for bringing this in. I am getting lots of queries on this and
people have got confused with these terminologies. The following are my
opinion and I am open to  have a healthy debate and knowledge sharing on
this topic.

Open Source Software can be classified in to 2 categories: 1. FOSS ( Free
Open Source Softwares) 2. COSS/POSS ( Commercial or Paid Open source
software) COSS  and POSS are my own definitions and I welcome any better
alternates to this.(NON FOSS???)

For example, Microsoft opens its Windows source code available FREE to
anyone then it could be classified as FOSS. But if they decide to charge
then it could be classified as POSS/COSS.

I did not bring the License issue in to this discussion.

Any thoughts in favour or otherwise?

Thanks,

Are you telling that charge for source code?

Anyhow i asked what's the difference between opensource and free software
if free software means "freedom to use,modify,redistribute" then what
opensource refers?

Which type is to be payed for usage,for eg: we have to buy redhat to
use it,whether it is named as open source or free sofware or what?

Free Software means not necessarily to be an open source product. For
example Adobe Reader is a free software (Proprietary to Adobe). When the
same Adobe Reader source code is available to us for use, modify and re
distribute then it is open source.

Hope this clarify your doubt.

hi,
let me explain in a very simple way

Free Software is Open Source Software.

Open Source software may not necessarily be Free Software.

Open Source allows the coder more control over his program compared to  
Free Software.

Open Source software can work with other proprietary software, while Free  
Software does not allow the same.

Vijay

the sourcecode of free and opensource software are open to the world or not.

this is now am having in my mind.
free software-source code may not be open.
opensource-source code available.

i think if you give points about both in the above manner it will be clear

Hi, you have understood the term 'free software' in a totally wrong sense.
?Free software? is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the
concept, you should think of ?free? as in ?free speech,? not as in ?free
beer.? I hope the following link will help you get a clear idea.
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html

@OP:
'Free software' is a term which emphasizes freedom, rather than just
revealing the source code.
Free Software ensures that a software created by using another free software
should be released as free software. In other words, if you modify a free
software you cannot release the modified version as proprietary software. On
the other hand, Open Source doesn't ensure this.

Can you clarify "work with proprietary software"?  Clearly several free
software licenses allow mixing with proprietary software.

@Balaji: Pls do not confuse with Senthil's reply.
In both 'free software' and 'open source software' - source code should be
given.
The perspective differs, however. I hope you understood the difference I
pointed out in my previous reply.

most get confused with freeware and free software.

Freeware- Software's which are free of cost, it might be proprietary [  
eg:Adobe Reader, Flash Player etc ], source code will not be available.

Free software - Free means freedom to learn, modify,redistribute - which  
means all free software comes with the source code. when you modify a free  
software and distribute, it should also be free.

Open source - These software need not be free of cost but it comes with  
the source code.


Hope you are clear.....

Thanks

Bruce Perens[1] put up that originally as an alternative to the term "free
software" for the Business world. Nothing much at that time. I suppose he is no
more with OSI now.

Keep maintaining that, whenever you quote it. 

Things have got corrupted a lot since then.

One small correction
when you modify a free software and redistribute a free software , it
need not be free.

I beg to differ.
Money involvement does not decide whether it is free or not.
(There are 4 freedoms decided by RMS)
Going by your example.
If you get source code with OS [with/without money] - OSS
If you get source code with OS and
(a)right modify
(b)use source code for any purpose
(c)share the source code in original/modified it with your neighbour
then it is FOSS

Again this is my opinion and would love to see healthy debate on this.

 'Free' in free software is used in the sense of *free speech*. You are
confusing it with *free beer*.

 I did not bring the License issue in to this discussion.

Then you haven't discussed at all! Free software is all about freedom and
hence license does [in fact only thing that] matter. Money doesn't matter.
Free software can also be paid/charged.

Any thoughts in favour or otherwise?

All free software are open source software because publishing source code is
essential to freedoms required to be a 'free software'. Not all open source
software are free software. (See my next mail in reply to vijay in this
thread to know why)

These are the freedoms that any license should grant you for it to qualify
as free software:

   - Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
   - Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to
   make it do what you wish.
   - Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your
   neighbor.
   - Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your
   improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the
   whole community benefits.

@Balaji: Hope this clears your doubt.

Get lightning fast and clever at the command line

You can use keyboard shortcuts and other command line tricks to make
entering commands easier and faster. You might already know about the
?tab? key which completes partial commands and even file and directory
names.

Here are some other keyboard shortcuts you can use within terminal:

Ctrl-a    Move to the start of the line.
Ctrl-e    Move to the end of the line.
Alt-] x   Moves the cursor forward to the next occurrence of x.
Alt-Ctrl-] x     Moves the cursor backwards to the previous occurrence of x.
Ctrl-u    Delete from the cursor to the beginning of the line.
Ctrl-k    Delete from the cursor to the end of the line.
Ctrl-y    Pastes text from the clipboard.
Ctrl-l    Clear the screen leaving the current line at the top of the screen.
Ctrl-x Ctrl-u    Undo the last changes. Ctrl-_
Alt-r     Undo all changes to the line.
Alt-      Ctrl-eExpand command line.
Ctrl-r    Incremental reverse search of history.
Alt-p    Non-incremental reverse search of history.
!!         Execute last command in history
!abc     Execute last command in history beginning with abc
!n        Execute nth command in history
^abc^xyz         Replace first occurrence of abc with xyz in last
command and execute it

I think there is an issue with the concept itself. You must notice that
there is a technical difference between "free' and "freedom".

I can understand "free Beer" but I am not agreeing or understanding with the
usage of "Free Speech" ( it means Paid Speech is available, Right?) To me,
it should have been "Freedom of Speech" to coincide with the  4 requirements
as mentioned.

Thanks,

This is what happens when people forget history. Sometimes people ask me
"why are you telling this history
to a newbie? (to whom i'm introducing GNU/Linux) instead of just saying it
has no virus, less bug blah blah.."

Because then they will soon forget why Linux and other free software came
into existence and will start thinking
"why should i give it for free money(by then they would've forgotten about
free knowledge) when i worked for writing it?"

To quote George Santayana:
     ?Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.?

I think you badly need a dictionary and, perhaps, a daily dose of 'The
Hindu'. Free speech never meant "Paid Speech is available".

As you can see below only one out of 12 possible meanings, has something to
do with cost.
All other 11 (and THE FIRST) have something to do with freedom.

I don't think so. Lets see an example:

You see, I'm a coder and  gave my code to people in hope that it will be
useful to somebody and
I did not want to restrict him from getting that knowledge. Then someone
took my source code and benefited from it
and after few years modified it to work on a new machine.

Now isn't it natural for me to expect that he should give that ported code
back to me and society so that i need not port it myself? I, personally, and
society, in general, had helped him and shouldn't i at the least expect that
he should return the favor by contributing back to society?

If i had released it as free software(eg: using  GPL) this would have
happened automatically. But not all open source licenses does this. In fact
this is a major point in which Open Source Initiative differs from Free
Software. (@Balaji, hope this cleared your doubt)

Now say, which gives more control to me(the coder)? I, the coder, expect
people who benefit from free knowledge to contribute back to it.

I assume you are asking about VirtualBox appliances, you can export any VM
as appliance. It is available under "File" menu. Likewise when you import an
appliance it will become a VM. I am not aware of any other techniques/tools.

@Akilan,

You should mind your words in public forum as you are not a super human
knowing everything. Please see the following Wiki pages that goes well with
my argument.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libre

@Sakthi:

People come to this forum to clarify their opinion that may be right or
wrong. This needs to be corrected and I appreciate your feeling. But again
we should also promote "freedom of expression"

Hope we conclude with this...


Thanks,

Hi,

This is a long answer, but I encourage you to read the entire thing ...slowly, 
to make sure you understand everything ...

On 08/21/2010 08:10 PM, balaji sivanath wrote:

To understand the difference you should understand the history of software.

Anyways, here is a brief explanation -- note that I have simplified this a bit 
but hopefully that won't affect the basic understanding.

Free software was a term 'formally' adopted by Richard Stallman (rms) in the 
early 80s to describe software which, according to him, allowed the maximum 
'freedom' to the person who used the software.

This meant that a person who used free software had to have complete *freedom* to:

0. Use the software for all purposes (ie: for good or for evil, for hobby or for 
business, for personal use or for commercial distribution)

1. Read the software's source code

2. Modify this source code

3. Redistribute these modifications

These aspects were termed as the 'freedoms' of the software. So any software 
that allowed these freedoms were called free software by rms and his supporters.

It is *important* to note that rms just made this *formal definition* of free 
software. There already was plenty of software that existed prior to rms's 
formal definition which allowed users some or all of these 'freedoms'.

Anyways, in an effort to categorize free software differently from software that 
was available at no cost, rms encouraged the use of the term 'freeware'.

However, by the time he started doing this, 'non-tech' users and people unaware 
of the 'real' meaning of software 'freedom' were already calling software that 
was available at no cost(*) as free software.

This confusion unfortunately still exists (in fact, as very well demonstrated by 
a reply to this thread).

Now, coming to the opposite of free software, ie: software which did not allow 
for any of the freedoms listed above -- that type of software is called 
'proprietary' software. Proprietary software disallows freedoms 0 and 1 (which 
basically implies 2 and 3 also are not possible).

Most proprietary software is 'licensed' to the user under something called the 
'ELUA' (End User License Agreement). If you have ever installed any proprietary 
software, you would have seen the ELUA and clicked the 'I Accept' agreement to 
install it. It is a good exercise to try and read these ELUAs.

Think of these ELUAs as a 'rental' or 'lease' agreement. Although you pay money, 
you are not 'buying' the software, you are 'leasing' it because, you don't 
really 'own' the software ! Since, you can't do whatever you want with it -- for 
example you cannot share it with anyone, or you cannot use it on more than one 
system or you cannot change it to suit your needs or you cannot resell an old 
copy of it or you cannot even make a 'copy' or it for backup purposes. Doing any 
of these might be illegal.

So, that was proprietary software. Something that you 'lease' from a company 
that controls everything that you can do with it.

Note that both Free software and Proprietary software might be available as 
freeware (ie: 0 cost), but only one of them is really 'free as in freedom'

Now, coming to the term Open Source. You see, when rms formalized the 'free 
software' term, many people did not know about free software, because almost all 
free software available then were available for Unix or Unix like platforms. 
This implied that free software was mostly available in Unix labs in 
universities and research institutions. At that time there wasn't any proper 
unix like system available for PCs.

However, in the early 90s linux landed on the scene and changed that. Free 
software was now also available on PCs alongwith the Linux OS which itself was 
also free software.

The growth of linux along with the growth of the internet (which incidentally 
was also being built on the backbone of free software) opened up the possibility 
of commercial offerings associated with free software such as service, support 
and commercial (ie: paid for) free software companies (like Red Hat) to exist.

However, due to the fact that most non-tech users (like managers, CEOs and 
investors) did not know or care about the freedom that software offered and 
would easily confuse the term 'free' with freeware, some of the biggest names in 
the free software world decided to create a new term.

This term was supposed to describe free software and also expand the formal 
definition of rms to allow for software that although allowed at least freedom 0 
and 1 may or may not restrict to an extent freedom 2 and 3 based on some 
licensing terms. The term they created was 'Open Source Software'.

So, all free software is essentially Open Source Software, however all open 
source software is not free software, according to rms's definition of free 
software.

The term FOSS is supposed to include all Free/Open Source software.

Hope that clarified your queries.

> is there any video illustrating them
There already is a lot of material explaining this including videos. Do a video 
search for free software. In face there are 2 movies which are pretty well know 
that cover the history of free software and linux -- search for 'The Code' or 
'Revolution OS' -- maybe someone should hold a friendly screening of these.


cheers,
- steve

(*) and shareware, which was free of cost software, but usually with some 
limitations such as limited time or limited users licenses or limited functionality

The proper and most gracious way to respond to someone who corrects your mistake 
is to say 'Sorry, thanks for correcting me !' - *not* trying to cover your 
mistake under the guise of a different opinion or freedom of expression.

Be humble when being corrected and you'll be respected more than when you try to 
build a smokescreen to cloud your obvious mistake.

To summarize, steve's explanation :

=== Free Software is the concept pioneered by Richard Stallman from
mid 1980s. To give users freedom to use, study, improve, modify and
distribute software with source code.

=== Open Source Software is a term coined by pragmatic people to make
the concept comfortable to businesses (to avoid free as in beer
connotation in Free Software).

Open Source Software gives room for compromise in Freedom. To
differentiate truly Free open source software from those which have
just source open, the term Shared Source is used.

Hope I got it right.

Ma Sivakumar

sorry, you got it wrong. open source software is truly free. So called
free software under GPL is restrictive of freedom

I have seen the same attitude towards open source also. We love to shout
from the rooftops about necessity for open source and we only use free
and open source software - but when we produce software, then it is
different. We want to hide it, we want to patent it.

depends on the license - if it is GPL, it has to be free - if it is BSD
it need not be free, in between licenses have varying conditions

As one can notice these are the default keybindings derived from EMACS.

For vim fans, there is some environment variables to use similar
keybindings, never tried it though

Thanks to all discussed here.

i hope i have understood correctly,here's what i have understood

Proprietary: closed source, free in cost when it said as "freeware",no
freedom at all

Free software: source is open to all,freedom is mandatory(free to
use,modify,redistribute), when redistributed it should be free
software,we can't make proprietary software from free software, we can
redistribute software with or without asking for money

Open source: source is open to all,freedom will vary according to the
license,we can make proprietary software from open source software. we
can redistribute software with or without asking for money

FOSS: free and open source software

though there's a fight between opensource and free software main
objective of both is to fight with proprietary software

actually the main difference between the two is attitude: free software
people focus on the philosphy of freedom, the open source people focus
on the methodology. I once made a small blog post on this aspect. It is

Here is what Gosling says about patents and sun micro systems,

"In Sun's early history, we didn't think much of patents. While there's a
kernel of good sense in the reasoning for patents, the system itself has
gotten goofy. Sun didn't file many patents initially. But then we got sued
by IBM for violating the "RISC patent" - a patent that essentially said "if
you make something simpler, it'll go faster". Seemed like a blindingly
obvious notion that shouldn't have been patentable, but we got sued, and
lost. The penalty was *huge*. Nearly put us out of business. We survived,
but to help protect us from future suits we went on a patenting binge. Even
though we had a basic distaste for patents, the game is what it is, and
patents are essential in modern corporations, if only as a defensive
measure...."

Seems like if you want to do software business in united states, you have to
commit the sin.

nope - Redhat conducts software business in the US - they are entirely
free of sin. And I am pretty sure that Collabnet is the same. Actually
quite a few americans practice what they preach - unlike us who spend
our time preaching ...

As amachu said, you cannot do business in US these days without having bunch
of patents in your pocket for your defence. If you are looking for their
patents, check http://bit.ly/aX6uaj

Red Hat is part of the Open Invention Network.

http://en.swpat.org/wiki/Open_Invention_Network
http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/

I was planning to reply to this thread earlier but did not find the time. The 
fact of the matter is although they are evil, Patents still are an unfortunate 
reality as per the legal system in US. Even if you don't believe in Patents you 
can get sued because existing patents are so general that you cannot write any 
code beyond 'hello world' style programs without infringing on patents (no jokes !).

Just like so many other things wrong with the world the best way to beat the 
system is to work within it yet do the right thing.

To the OP, Rahul already mentioned defensive publication, for example:

http://www.openpatents.net/

Although, if you already own a patent, you could also consider contributing the 
patent to organizations such as Open Invention Network or the Open Patent Alliance

ok - so I am wrong. but not very wrong. I see 80 or so patents,
apparently one in 2010, 2-3 in 2009 and all the rest several years ago.
So either they have stopped writing innovative software or have stopped
wasting their time (and lawyers fees) filing patents. I wonder how they
do business if they only file one or two patents a year?

compare this to the number microsoft has filed. Anyway thanks for doing
the research. Very enlightening.

aha - so you *can* do business in the US without getting patents!
Correct me if I am wrong - the objective of patenting something (or
defensively publishing it) is to prevent someone else from patenting
your idea and then suing you for using your own idea. The objective is
*not* for the purpose of preventing other people from using your
idea/invention. right?

Well, yes, you can. The ugly thing about patents is although you can run a 
business without getting patents, you can't become too big or too threatening to 
someone who does own patents.

The only reason these days patents are used is to arm-twist potential 
competition (I don't even need to supply references, look at almost any patent 
suit in the recent past, it is initiated by patent trolls or direct competition 
is a masked manner).

The other part of course is if, (like IBM, Novell and the other members of OIN) 
you already have patents, it is best to release them to the community or make a 
patent promise using something like OIN.

Yes.

Defensive patenting is to create a patent on something so that you can protect 
yourself from being sued.

Defensive publication is publication of an idea so that later on if someone 
tries to patent the idea, you can point to your publication to say the idea is 
'prior art' (and as such not patentable).

Red Hat practices both because it has to protect the trust of all it's 
supporters and has too much at stake to take put itself in a vulnerable position 
to legal attacks by as not doing so.

We are a free software consulting firm. I am a paying member of the FSF. I subscribe to the patent related views of FSF. I also subscribe to the 'pragmatic idealism' view point. 
Morality and Legality are very different. We need to operate within the established laws. As the laws are bad, FSF and other organisations are  lobbying to change them. Until they are changed, we need to adopt a practical approach within the boundaries of the law.

Best thing is to patent it and then transfer ownership to FSF. We applied for a patent which was rejected. But if we had been awarded it, we were planning to assign ownership to either the FSF or http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/ 

The other solution is to challenge the patents legally by citing prior-art.

I am not commenting on the morality of patenting here but the practical solution in the real world scenario where patent laws exist. Until software patent system are legally dealt with, the above solution is the most practical.

Patenting costs quite a bit of money so be warned.

Am I correct If I say -- "Idea cannot be patented but once they are
published they can be used as prior art for defensing purpose ?"

you say this because GPLed software is "not free to make it
proprietary" right? I'm sorry. I don't want to place my software in near
public domain where people can do whatever they wished.

When India was said to have attained freedom, nobody meant that there was no
laws governing us and we can do whatever we wanted.
we got freedom of expression, religion, voting, blah blah, but at the same
time we had lot of duties too. That is what is called freedom.
Rights without duties, freedom without morality is not desirable. That is
not true freedom at all. That will lead to anarchy.

When you just want to edit a file and not worry about keys or having

Thus, you can use vim's encrypted file format. ;)

is very small actually.]

I'm waiting for the approval of my university to put my final year project
code into GPL.

Note: I have not included any patches and edits I sent to other people's
GPLed software.

PS: I too have written some code. Its not that i just want to use other
people's software and not give back anything.

And KG, please refute my points about freedom and responsibility instead of

Why are you going for fedora.. is there any particular reason (in our

suggest them to use it),
What's meant by kickstart method,
Four thousand two hundred and twenty five!!! can you tell just a note
what are those packages.

Now the gadget is available as a part of Google network itself. One does not
need to give the URL manually to add it.
It can be searched for added to the pages from add gadget window itself. For
adding it to iGoogle clicking following link will work:

To customize the color, border etc before adding to any page or blog you can
go here:

Since this module does not care about blog posts/ feeds etc presence of
Google Blogger API is *not* necessary.
So this should work on any blog sites that accept general Google Pages API
(they may have their own
blog engine and API though). But i'm not sure if wordpress supports Google
API.

You can put this wherever OpenSocial APIs are supported because Google Pages
API is pre-requisite for OpenSocial.
You can add this to your profile or pages in Hi5, MySpace, LinkedIn, etc.
But you cannot add it to Facebook profile. :-(
But Facebook is already taken care of by people i guess. We have an event in
ILUGC page. :-)

Well, *theoretically* ^ideas^ can *never* be patented. Not in the US, not anywhere.

*Theoretically* only a mechanism (ie: a system 'implementing' an idea) or a 
method can be patented. Unfortunately however, the US patent law is so broken 
when it comes to software that all you have to do to patent an idea is precede 
your idea with the statement 'A system, method or apparatus for ....<your idea>' 
and in all probability you would be granted a patent.

Ironically, the initial motivation for patent law was to protect the 'small guy' 
from the 'big corporations' who had the resources to just reverse engineer the 
small guy's invention and make money out of it without ever crediting the small 
guy. Unfortunately ignorance and sheer volume has led to the mess of software 
patents in its current state.

Anyways, to answer your question simplistically -- Yes, publishing your 
invention effectively proves that you thought about the invention first so 
anybody else applying for the patent will not be called the inventor (ie: will 
not be awarded the patent). So your publication is called as prior art.

There is an effort by eff as well as OIN to help the US patent office to 
identify such false patents:

http://w2.eff.org/patent/
http://linuxdefenders.org/projects?tab=1
http://linuxdefenders.org/projects?tab=2

If you are interested in (US) IP law and software, it is a good place to help out.

Fortunately for us Indians, there is an actively involved community of mostly 
unknown and under-appreciated activists including (surprise, surprise !) 
government babus who understand the issue of software patents ! This is the 
reason why India rejected the idea of software patents the last time it came up:

http://www.financialexpress.com/news/story/82155/

However, the threat still remains, all the MNC software companies who love the 
software patent culture and have deep pockets keep trying to push the agenda for 
this in India too. It really is up to us to inform and educate enough people so 
that the ridiculous notion of patenting 'ideas' (that's what software is all 
about anyways) is never accepted here in India.

cheers,
- steve

That is confusing.  When people talk about "defensive patents", they are
refer to the policy of organizations that only use patents as for
defence (ie) they don't sue first for any patent violation.  In the case
of Red Hat,  the policy is made part of a public promise to assure free
and open source software developers a certain level of trust in not
acting in bad faith.  I would note however that a patent license is
preferably to a promise and there are people within and outside Red Hat
pushing for that. 

Although other patents can be shown to be prior art, it is a somewhat of
a dicey strategy unless the other patents have already expired because
if you say patent bar is prior art to patent foo, it will invalidate
patent foo but the patent holder of patent bar can sue you for a
violation.

Speaking for myself, the amount of employees and money that Microsoft
can spend on filing and getting patents is much much larger than Red Hat
can hope to or want to compete with.  The answer to that problem is
promoting the policy of eradicating or atleast preventing/ limiting the
spread of the software patent problem globally and becoming part of
patent pools like OIN.

Excellent choice ! At the end of the day however, the people who do want to 
subvert this sharing, will probably just go ahead and do it anyways. The onus 
would be on you to prove that they did so (just take a look at 
gpl-violations.org for examples of how even big companies rip off the efforts of 
developers without any acknowledgment). However, at least by using something 
like GPL you expressively make it /illegal/ and not just /immoral/ to not share 
modifications.

Before advocating this as a option, have you even talked to FSF first on
whether it is possible to transfer patents to them and whether they are
willing to accept?

Free Software means a software which is release under a license which
fulfill 4 freedom for software users and GPL license is one such example.

I am a developer, I never care about public domain. I want to write code
 for me and my community.
I use to talk about lots of persons from street shopkeeper to someone well
educated sitting in AC room. Most of them do not care about Linux and
its philosophy of freedom. Same with companies. For example, in Delhi, you
can find 'N' number  of Companies who work and get earning from "setting up
Drupal CMS", They never contributed back Drupal. When you release any good
in public domain, public will try to harness in negative manner. so I follow
GPL because, GPL is made by a hacker for hacker community so that software
will remain with hacker community at the same time it can be used by public.

See, Proprietary Software always comes first, but always the winner is free
software.
GPL has patent clauses too. GPL is a well engineered license for software.

PS: I even know a company from a close, who actually made modification in
Linux kernel and selling them into their switch and router. See, Company
only want to make profit at any cost. They never care about GPL and freedom.
So why should we write a software under 'near public domain'

Since, many colleges don't have DVD drives in the computers, the only way
for us to setup a FOSS lab is through PXE based network installation
simultaneously without depending on optical disk/drives and for this we use
customized fedora installation combining Fedora Everything +  rpmfusion
repository (including all multimedia softwares / codecs etc).

If anyone could help me to create a similar one for Ubuntu based Kickstart
installation, then we can do for Ubuntu also.

Almost everything equivalent to proprietary kind of softwares.  The
installation time was about 1:45 hrs on a C2D with 2GB RAM and complete
installation takes about 15GB space totally (usually we setup a 60 seat FOSS
lab in less than 5 hrs using our FOSS Setup / Deployment Kit)

P.S: We have already started setting up FOSS labs for engg. colleges in the
coimbatore region.  If any college require a FOSS lab setup, they can send a
request mail to us and we will setup the lab ASAP.

Hi all,

I recently found that Google has released its voice and video  chat plugin for Linux users . 

When i tried to install it for my System running Fedora 13 from the site http://www.google.com/chat/video ,

I found the plugin is downloaded in .deb extension .ie., for Debian based System . 

Isnt the Google plugin available for Fedora ?

Regards,

Arun Prakash

Not sure if there is a way but Google Technical requirements state
that a Debian based Linux distribution is necessary.

Thanks a lot KG.

I have invited Mr. Narain (a tech Entrepreneur) to take care of
English language write-ups and English press communication. He is not
part of ilugc lists so far and is keen to use FOSS for his next
start-up.

Anyone else interested in getting involved - Good English writing
skills, contacts in English press and opportunity to interact with
news papers and magazines, is welcome to pitch in.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikQXPGBEFUNa7ex_SiFaFcoec5qB=9VD39eGa22@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
A company who's into joomla theme designing and customisation is
looking to move from Windows to Linux. The 2 main problems they are
facing are:-
1. Replacement for Photoshop. According to them, GIMP is not good
enough for their needs. And also, I am myself not competent enough
with it either. So, we have kept it as the second issue for now.
2. A replacement for Dreamweaver which they need to use for their
coding needs. I would like to get recommendations on what would be a
good IDE or any other software to replace Dreamweaver. They intended
audience is recent pass outs from engineering colleges around Mumbai.
These people are barely familiar with Linux and only thing they have
ever used for web designing is Dreamweaver(pirated, of course). A GUI
is a must and vi/emacs are a definite no.

mentioned in http://github.com/driftx/chiton#readme
while I run the driftx-chiton/bin/chiton-client following error occurred.
Traceback (most recent call last):

If you consider menus and buttons as GUI then Emacs does come with a GUI. ;)

I suggest you please use CassandraCli .
Cassandra has very basic interactive command line interface , we are using
it successfully.

Dear ILUG member,

in terminal only.(and also using Thrift)
             In order to view the data in GUI I installed chiton.
             I am facing the following problem

Dear ILUG member,

             I used CassandraCli with that I can able to retrieve the data
in terminal only.(and also using Thrift)
             In order to view the data in GUI I installed chiton.

Dear ILUG Members,

 I am new to the linux & ILUGC.
I installed  apache Cassandra-0.6.3. in my Ubuntu 10.04 .
To display the Cassandra data I need to install  cassandra admin GUI client
For this I installed driftx-chiton-bd91965.,
To install driftx-chiton-bd91965 i install the following packages as
mentioned in http://github.com/driftx/chiton#readme

 Python 2.5 or later(usr/include/python2.9)

 Twisted 8.1.0 or later(usr/share/doc/python-twisted)
  Thrift (latest svn)(home/downloads/thrift0.2.0)
  PyGTK 2.14 or later
  simplejson(home/durga/simplejson2.1.1)
  Telephus (home/durga/driftx-Telephus-fb32fc7)

run  "sudo python setup.py install" for each except Thrift

I include the PYTHONPATH from this link http://tinyurl.com/24gdgkv
<http://tinyurl.com/24gdgkv>

in driftx-chiton$ *export
PYTHONPATH=/home/durga/driftx-Telephus-fb32fc7/:/home/durga/driftx-chiton/*

**while I run the driftx-chiton/bin/chiton-client following error occurred.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./chiton-client", line 6, in <module>
    from chiton.viewer import ChitonViewer
  File "/home/durga/driftx-chiton-bd91965/chiton/viewer.py", line 2, in
<module>
    from telephus.client import CassandraClient
  File "/home/durga/driftx-Telephus-fb32fc7/telephus/client.py", line 1, in
<module>
    from telephus.cassandra.ttypes import *
  File "/home/durga/driftx-Telephus-fb32fc7/telephus/cassandra/ttypes.py",
line 7, in <module>
    from thrift.Thrift import *
ImportError: No module named thrift.Thrift


Thanks and Regards

We can not expect 100% equivalent alternate software.

1. GIMP is a perfect replacement to photoshop.
But, we have to unlearn photoshop or learn gimp.
(This is applicable to most of the FOSS alternate software)

2. Eclipse, Quanta, Aptana - Try these things.

Migrating to FOSS is a great decision.
But, before that, we have to train the employees about the
concepts of FOSS, the need for implementation and how-to use the tools.

Wishes.

There are so many activities.
Giving publicity is a great task.
Tell about SFD to all your friends and contacts.
mail,call,invite them to SFD.

Prepare for any suitable talk and get a stall.
If already there is a stall, that you know something,
talk to the person and handle the stall for sometime.
Thattime, the other person can visit the other stalls.


> am not aware so much in linux tools and applications ?

Hope you are in list for sometime.
There is a series called "OAOD".
Just read those mails and install the applications, play around them.
That will give you more view about the existing applications in linux.
You can demonstrate any application you like.

Thanks for the interest.

We welcome more new fresh faces for the stalls.
That will be a great experience for them to start their contribution.

The cloud service providers are not fully compatible with each other, eg.
it is not feasible to run an Amazon Machine Image on the Rack Space Cloud
without any modifications.

That said, the Open Virtualization Format (OVF) is something many vendors
are supporting.  Packaging your VM in OVF will allow you to import the VM
on several hypervisors with minimal or no modifications.  OVF is still maturing
so industry support is limited.

the player presses the corresponding key, Tux will position himself to
eat the fish. The game is intended for children learning to type,
though it does have higher difficulty levels which even experienced

I remember myself making a noise for "free" photo galleries .
This time 'no noise' :P  I am pleased to offer on behalf of
fosscommunity.in hosting space for all the pictures of SFD
http://www.fosscommunity.in/photos/ shows a recent Debian event . It
would be nice to have SFD photos in the gallery.
PS:contact me off list if you have any pictures of FOSS events to put
up on the gallery

where is the personal attack? You said you do not want to place your

placed it? My software is all in BSD license - and you are free to ask
where the url is (I will not take it as a personal attack)

there is no real subsititute for dreamweaver - because the idea behind
dreamweaver is to make sure the coder knows nothing about coding. The
closest would be quanta plus, but to use that one has to know css, html,
js etc.

Message-ID: <1282637065.3280.12.camel@debian>


Hi All,

I run  a dual boot system (WinXP/ Deb 5.0). Of late windows partition
crashed and I use only Debian portion alone for my PC work.

I bought a Nokia e 63 phone. Now,Kandy does not recognise this phone.
I have the contacts from my earlier Sony Ericsson phone  in Windows
portion in Outlook and also as a .csv file, that too in Windows portion.
I am able to see the .csv file too.

Obviously, the manufacturer CD Contains WIn programs only. Little
googling also threw up windows based solutions only.

How to synchronise the phone in Debian?

Any help or pointers to resources will be welcome.

Regards

Dear All,

I need one help.

In python, I need to set the floating point precision as 2.

I am getting the following output in python while adding two float nos.

>>>a=79.73
>>>b=0.5
>>> a+b
80.230000000000004

I need exactly 2 precision point in this float value. i.e. 80.23

Even though I tried in round method, its not satisfied me. Because

>>> a = round(3.7138464897123424324355124355,2)
>>> a
3.71
>>> a = round(3.7238464897123424324355124355,2)
>>> a
3.7200000000000002

Can you understand the difference. Depends upon the value, it will round.

I no need ceil and floor options. Because it may change the original values.

I need just 2 precision point in the float value.

I am getting two numbers dynamically. So I can not say exactly, what kind of
floating numbers I am going to use.

What I have to do ?

Any suggestions ?

Thanks in advance.

You might want to convert them to Decimal type. Look up the
following URL (Python documentation) for more information:
      http://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html

If all you want to do is "print" the value upto 2 decimal points, then
a print with format specifier should do the trick. The following URL
(Stack Overflow) has this question answered:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/455612/python-limiting-floats-to-two-decimal-points

That's a limitation of binary floating point. The number 80.23 cannot be
represented exactly. Use the decimal module if you want exact numbers:
<http://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html>. For more information look
at the Python Docs on floating point:
<http://docs.python.org/tutorial/floatingpoint.html>.

As you'll see there, Python 3.1 will print the result in the way you
want, but if you want more accurate arithmetic, multiply all your
numbers by 100 and use integers instead or use the decimal module.

Yes, we can do this multiply by 100 way.
By this way I can handle 80 and 23 as two separate integers.
But when I want make it as float
>>>80+0.23
 80.230000000000004

again it will be come same floating value.
so I cant use this way.

this one works for ASCII only i guess. what about file containing

Well, I meant something like using 8000 and 23 instead of 80 and 0.23.
Then when the time comes to print your number you can just do something
like:

	a = str(8000+23)
	b = a[:-2] + '.' + a[-2:]

Your output will be the nice 80.23 that you always wanted. Unless you're
doing some division that requires you to hold on to the third place or
lower, why use floats when integers will do the job?

Thanks a lot. I forget to mention here. I dont want the result float value
in string.

I need only the float values with 2 precision. That to without rounding the
result.

Any idea?

Well, then, go with what everyone else is telling you. Use the 'decimal'
module. Or use Python 3.1 to hide the issue.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=P5BSNR2oeqNfUbez9h42a-MEL9h+h0khiW6GV@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
     I have script which is used to read the apache server log file and
returns the set values. Here is the script,

require 'rubygems'
require 'apachelogregex'
require 'set'
require 'pp'

urls = Set.new
format = '%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}\"'
  parser = ApacheLogRegex.new(format)
  File.readlines('aleurier_access.log').collect do |line|
  @line = parser.parse(line)
   urls.add(@line["%h"])
      # {"%r"=>"GET /blog/index.xml HTTP/1.1", "%h"=>"87.18.183.252", ... }
end
puts urls
pp @line

For eg, when I run this script it prints all host ID, what i like to do is
how to print repeated IP addresses only once and also prints the other IP
addresses which is not repeated again.
I tried uniq but it supports only array elements not reads through files. I
also tried this one it can used for small file but it doesn`t suits for
larger files.

require 'rubygems'
require 'apachelogregex'
require 'set'
require 'pp'

urls = Set.new
format = '%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}\"'
  parser = ApacheLogRegex.new(format)
  File.readlines('aleurier_access.log').collect do |line|
  l = parser.parse(line)
   urls.add(l["%h"])
      # {"%r"=>"GET /blog/index.xml HTTP/1.1", "%h"=>"87.18.183.252", ... }
end
puts urls.to_a.sort
pp l

>>> from decimal import *
>>> getcontext().prec = 3
>>> getcontext().rounding = ROUND_UP
>>> Decimal('3.1415926535') + Decimal('2.7182818285')
Decimal('5.86')

or

>>> getcontext().prec = 3
>>> getcontext().rounding = ROUND_DOWN
>>> Decimal('3.1415926535') + Decimal('2.7182818285')
Decimal('5.85')


This gives the what I need.
But I can not use this Decimal data type.

I am doing project for Indian Meteorological Department using CDAT python
library.

Now I am plotting weather symbol markers on India Map at corresponding
latitude and longitude (in float) dynamically.
Due to inaccuracy floating value of latitude & logitude,
the position of markers are moved away from the exact position of the
stations on the map in vcs.

so I need float value in 2 precision without changing the value. Not in
string. Not in Decimal.

In CDAT vcs module supports only the 'float data' type to represent the
latitude & logitude in map.

Any suggestions?

Firstly, if you're using it for this purpose then you needn't worry at
all. A difference in longitude from 80.23? to 80.230000000000004? is a
difference in terms of surface distance of a few nanometres at most.
Hardly a problem for weather.

Secondly and more importantly, you're asking for the impossible. The
floating point data type can only represent a fraction of all rational
numbers accurately. This is not a limitation of the language you're
choosing, it is a limitation of the format.

Dear All,

On behalf of ilugc and kanchilug, we people conducted One Day FOSS
Workshop in SRM University, Poteri on 21.08.2010.

We people Rajkumar, Dhasthagheer, Sanmugam, Balakrishnan, LogeshPrabhu
and Arulalan (myself)  conducted this workshop for CSE Department.

Nearly 250 students participated. Students are first year and second
year of CSE in that University.
The workshop started at 10.30 am.

First we introduced ourself and about kanchilug to all the students.

Logesh Prabhu started with "Why FOSS and Gnu/Linux ?" and explained
detailed about FOSS with its History.

Then Dhasthagheer took "An Introduction to Php".

After lunch, Rajkumar demonstrated the "Joomla" and explained the
features of php in CMS.

Myself(Arulalan) took "An Introduction to Python".

Students enjoyed with php and python, raised many questions in that.

BalaKrishnan explained the steps of Ubuntu installation as dual boot
by live demo.

At last we were windup the workshop around 5 pm.
We explained everything in English only.
SRM Lug provided ubuntu 10.04 dvd to all the participations.

Finally we explained about Lugs, mailing list, forums and community supports.
We invited all of them to SFD'10.

This is first time, kanchilug members have been conducting FOSS
workshop in such a big University.
We thank Shiv Deepak (III yr CSE) for organized this FOSS workshop and
invited us.
Also we thank the management of the SRM Univesity.

Hi all,

One of my friend is a .NET developer and wants to move to opensource
programming language. I have suggested him to concentrate in JAVA and
Python, since I feel that JAVA is widely used Opensource language and Python
is also growing fast and has same type of features like JAVA.

I am not a programmer, so I need your suggestion to help him to make his
career in Open source software.

Contradiction?

Widely used doesn't necessarily mean that it helps in solving
problems. Always use a programming language that helps you to solve a
particular programming problem, rather than choosing a programming
language, and then deciding to solve all problems with it.

That would be awesome. But I'm not good at image editing. If someone could

Hi Girish,
     I think you caught it wrongly, I supposed to tell that it worked on
fedora unix, ubuntu, debian and opensuse has far I know. Mainly I heard that
OpenBSD is similar to Linux OS so I thought it could work on it. Don`t
mistake me Please...

Subject: [Ilugc] [Tip] Add Timestamp to history
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=2TkWJJ_14aF+ZD4ZuGjNtFSqePdG0tcScBbSh@mail.gmail.com>

 Add Timestamp to history

$ export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "

History usually only gives the command number and the command. This
will add a timestamp to the history file.

Note: This will only put the correct timestamp on commands used after
the export is done. You may want to put this in your .bashrc

This is sample output :

  759  2010-08-24 21:42:14 ls -lct /etc | tail -1 | awk '{print $6, $7, $8}'
  760  2010-08-24 23:11:25 history
  761  2010-08-24 23:11:29 export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "
  762  2010-08-24 23:11:32 history

Yay! at last some of my thoughts perfectly match here.

I have done programming long back say in mid 80's in assembly, dbase
and the such, in Fortran in late 80's, Pascal and c++  inearly 90's,
Foxpro, Clipper and some Oracle SQL, PL/SQL and  in mid and late 90's
and early part of the century -- I still remember my tyrst with the
Y2K -- some bash scripting in 90's of of the late my programming has
mostly like a typist typing out e-mails, doing spell checks, pointing
out other's error and the such.

Now one needs to have intimate relationship with one's tools and the
problem(s) at hand. The solution makes itself visible and slowly
surfaces itself. Now, I am wondering what software maintanance
practices are in Non-IT Corporates. That should itself could be a big
industry.

Just my 2 kaasu

oh!! just noticed, you mean to say you are getting the same time stamp for
all the commands ?

I got the problem, the timestamp for command lines that executed in the
previous sessions may not valid, as the time was not tracked. Even I see the
same thing with my Debian.

Hi,
     U can do like,

irb(main):001:0> a=File.open("a","r")
=> #<File:a>

irb(main):002:0> arr=a.readlines
=> ["1\n", "2\n", "3\n", "4\n", "45\n", "1\n", "23\n", "4\n", "56\n", "3\n",
"12\n", "45\n", "6\n", "34\n"]
read the lines from file and assign into an array.

irb(main):003:0> arr.length
=> 14

irb(main):004:0> arr.uniq
=> ["1\n", "2\n", "3\n", "4\n", "45\n", "23\n", "56\n", "12\n", "6\n",
"34\n"]

irb(main):005:0> arr.uniq.length
=> 10

Using the array only we can unique the values.

Hi all,
     Today we will learn how to read command line arguments in a Ruby
script. To can solve it by using the special Ruby array ARGV to get the
information you need.
To get the number of command line arguments passed in to your Ruby script,
check ARGV.length, like this:

# quit unless our script gets two command line arguments
unless ARGV.length == 2
  puts "Dude, not the right number of arguments."
  puts "Usage: ruby MyScript.rb InputFile.csv SortedOutputFile.csv\n"
  exit
end


Hi Balachandar muruganantham I`m not expert in ruby just a beginner but
anyhow I will try to find a solution for your issue and send it back to you.
Thank you

Hi all,

There is a library called OptionParser. That will be useful for handling the
command line arguments in ruby.

Hi all,
    Yeah we can use OptionParser but it suits for advance to perform low
level operation we can use ARGV right.

Great hack! But if you know what you really want,
it can be much simpler on Linux:
    stat --format="%Y" /etc/fedora-release
    # Works for Fedora Linux

    stat --format="%Y" /etc/slackware-version
    # Works on Slackware Linux

    stat --format="%Y" /etc/

    # Works for Fedora Linux

    stat --format="%Y" /etc/slackware-version

    # Works on Debian Linux

    stat --format="%Y" /etc/lsb-release

By this, expensive ls and awk commands could
be avoided.

Keep up the good work!

Hi,

I am doing project in C/Linux. I am interested to increase the performance and optimize my project..

1)      Memory debugging ( To identify the memory leak , unused  or unintialized variables etc)

2)      Profiling

3)      Static code analysis

4)      Dynamic code analysis

Can you please suggest some open source tools to perform the above. I just surfed and identified the below.
But not sure whether this is the best fit for  C/Linux coding. Please suggest the some other opensource tools.

Memory debugging tool  &  Profiling:
http://valgrind.org/
TAU  Performance : http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php
I prefer valgrind as it is simple and inbuilt with linux.

Static code -analysis :

Zebronics makes them still, if you really want to buy one of these.
You'll find them in Ritchie Street at some of the bigger stores, Delta
Peripherals and the like. Call before you go.

You'd better have a good reason to be doing this because you don't need
to stick to an old chipset just because of the processor.

Dear ILUG Members,

              I am new to ubuntu.
             Tell me how to install simplejson 2.1.1
            I need to install Simplejson for Cassandra admin GUI client

           For that I install chiton while running

   durga@sybrant-desktop:~cassandra_admin_GUI/driftx-chiton-bd91965/bin$
./chiton-client
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./chiton-client", line 6, in <module>
    from chiton.viewer import ChitonViewer
ImportError: No module named chiton.viewer

I also set the PYHTONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.6

A game for wasting time.

$ fortune | cowsay

?let a cow tell you your fortune

$ fortune | cowsay -f tux

Let Tux bring the fortune cookie

You have to install fortune & cowsay packages.

The following fortune tip already sent in the mailing list by Mr.Grish
at (01.10.09)

Thanks to grish anna. :)


$ fortune
You look like a million dollars. ?All green and wrinkled.

$ fortune -im oscar

will search for all Oscar Wilde witticisms.

$ fortune -s

prints only short jokes and so on.

It is a game but meant for people who don't like computer games. It
can serve as a nice break.

If my past employers come to know that I would have wasted at least
10% of my working hours
?doing this, I wonder what they would say.

Subject: [Ilugc] Strange problem connecting to the Internet
Message-ID: <1282901430.3847.5.camel@mjolnir>

Hello, everyone,

I have a wireless router (it also has a modem inside) to get my Airtel
internet connection. Generally, my computer connects to the wireless
network and I browse.

Recently, though, I was forced to get a modem and connect that to one of
the wireless router's ports because the modem part of the router wasn't
working very well.

Now, I can connect to the wireless router from any computer but I can
only access the Internet from Windows computers. Pinging any outside
address from a Linux computer results in a 'Destination Net Unreachable'
error. The very same computer will then connect to the very same
wireless network when in Windows and browse (and ping) just fine.

I can access other computers within the network when I'm on Linux. I
just can't access the Internet. I've done the following so far:

1. Ask dhclient to get a new lease.

2. Deleted the network settings and then entered them again.

3. Rebooted (ha ha)

Funnily enough, when I use the inbuilt modem in the router again it
works just fine.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks for reading,

Shall we have a volunteer meet for SFD preparations?

What about tomorrow evening?

Tomorrow, there is a unconference for tamil computing at MIT.
Shall we have a meet after the unconference?
around 6.00-6.30 pm?

Hope most of us attend the conference there.

Please share your thoughts.

I am as clueless as you are. ;)

However I would do the following:

1) Look at the "My Network places" -> TCP Properties -> and find out
the default router and so on.

2) Try dhclient and find if I get the default router on my linux box.

3) Use nameserver as 4.2.2.2 or 8.8.8.8 as DNS

More such suggestions.

Hi Ranjith

You call it scripting? I think Ruby's a full fledged language. Jump straight
into "code blocks" and start coding with those.

What's your default gateway?  Ensure it's set to the

Disable DHCP service on your WiFi router and use only
the DSL modem DHCP service in your LAN.


For further troubleshooting, list the IPs of your WiFi
router, DSL modem and IP config of your Linux box.

 or other FOSS resources
Message-ID: <AANLkTikJiNs=Knm-P-i0CoYXgdCuob-UcqF+XV33kAc-@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

In the past few days, I am getting a lot of mails from ILUG-C student
members requesting for Ubuntu / Fedora repos for their own use / distribute
in their colleges.

I kindly request the student members to note the following, before making
request for Distro repositories.

I have about more than 5 TB of FOSS collections (from old to recent versions
of all 32/64 bit major Linux/BSD distros, historic kernel to recently
released kernel source code, complete source code of major distros, static
wikipedia download, foss related documentations etc, which I have collected
over several years)

As I believe, these resources could be more useful for the education
community, particularly for the students, hence I decided to distribute
these resources free of cost for the students community.

But, many students were expecting these resources along with media for free
of cost, which is impossible for me to cover the cost of material and
transit cost.

I welcome all the student members to bring  external USB hard disk / dvd
media and collect these resources free of cost in my office at any time they
wish.

Our Address:

LinuXpert Systems
New No.1, Vembuliamman Koil Street,
Pazhavanthangal,
(Near Pazhavanthangal Railway Station Subway and above Hotel Tandoor),
Chennai - 600 114.

Thanks in advance.

If possible, provide an option to pay the cost of media and despatch
into your bank account on receipt of which you can send the materials.

This will be useful for non-Chennai colleges to avail your service.
With an SBI account (SBI branch coverage is widest), money can be
deposited from any of the core banking branches into your account.

Hi, Raja,

I should say that it worked itself out. I suspended my laptop and when I
later woke it up it connected to the wireless network and I had Internet
access. Strange, eh?

My default gateway is the WiFi router at 192.168.1.1 This works on
Windows and I'm loath to change it lest the Windows computers here stop
working.

Here's the thing. The Airtel tech set it up like this so I can't explain
why it is the following way, but anyway here you go:

Modem: 192.168.1.1 (if I connect to it directly with cable)

Router: 192.168.1.1 (if I connect to it over wireless)

My laptop: 192.168.1.2 (on both Windows and Ubuntu)

Another laptop: 192.168.1.4

A desktop: 192.168.1.7

The last two are Windows-only. As you can see, I'm unable to access the
modem while connected to the router. Thank you for your help.
Unfortunately, I'm not about to change anything now that it is all
working. You know how it is, "if it's working, don't fix it" :)

Regards,

The settings on both Windows and Ubuntu are identical. I also use
Google's 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 always on my computers (though that's a
good tip) but unfortunately, the Ubuntu computer was unable to ping
8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4 or 4.2.2.[1-7]. Weirdly, NetworkManager would not let
me configure the DNS settings either. The 'Apply' button was greyed out.

However, in a surprising development, after I put my laptop under
suspend and then brought it back up later it connected and now works
pretty much flawlessly except for signal being oddly low and the
wireless network running at 1 Mb/s. I believe this is just erroneously
being reported, though, since I can download at 230 kB/s from the
Internet.

Thanks for your help!

The default gateway would be the wired DSL modem's IP number (as Raja
has suggested).

Configuring network through the NetworkManager has always been a hit &
miss for me.

As an alternate, you can remove the Network Manager and configure the
network parameters in /etc/network/interfaces.

It works kind of out of the box. Just create a mobile broadband connection
with "bsnlnet" and connect to it.For Windows BSNL has provided a fancy app
which has connect button / calling options etc and installs something. But
with ubuntu 10.04 it just recognizes.

PS: Modem used was Teraom LW272.BSNL also provides huwaei modems.

I don't like problems which manifest and fix themselves automatically.
It shows a lack of control and understanding on my/your part.

IP conflict!  Change wifi router's LAN IP to 192.168.1.2.

Your Linux system is probably using WiFi router's ARP
entry so it's unable to reach the web.  Windows computers
are using ARP entry of your DSL modem and are able to
get online.


Clean up your IP addresses.  Use the following scheme:

192.168.1.1-9 for network appliances (DSL/Wifi router, switches, VPN server)
192.168.1.10-19 for network printers, scanners, etc
192.168.1.20-49 for servers
192.168.1.50-99 for static IP assignment
192.168.1.100-199 for DHCP assignment
192.168.1.250-254 for testing/temporary assignment

If you have 2 DHCP servers, split the DHCP scope accordingly
eg. 192.168.100-149 on DHCP server 1 and rest on the other
DHCP server.  But ensure default gateway assignment is always
set correctly to 192.168.1.1.

connecting in a reverse way than normal is called reverse shell.
while installing trojan , server part will be installed on victims computer
and client will be installed in cracker machine(Traditional Client Server
way way ).
in the above method if the client is behind nat or firewall its tough to
make a connection.
The client will open a port and listen for the connection from cracker. a
simple netsat -n will reveal that and those connections can easily blocked
by firewall and routers .

Lets Come to Reverse Shell.
In this method server will be installed on cracker machine and client will
be installed on the victim machine. once the the client installed it will
try to communicate with the crackers machine server and opens an session.
Reverse shell is less reliable than the traditional way but it will blasts
away most of the firewall and NAT .

Reverse shell is boon to crackers ;)

*

We are jointly holding the following event:

                       *1st September, 2010,

         Lecture Hall, India International Center Annexe, New Delhi.
* Organized by *Software Freedom Law Centre, Knowledge Commons and
                  Center for Internet and Society.
                      *Sponsored by *Red Hat.*

Concept Note and Agenda  :
http://www.scribd.com/doc/36546366/Software-Patents-and-the-Commons-Concept-Note-and-Agenda


Over the past few years, commons-based approaches have emerged as a
significant source of knowledge creation and innovation. Today, Free and
Open Source Software (FOSS) power 455 out of the top 500 supercomputers1 in
the world, and almost 56 percent of the web servers on the Internet.
Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia developed collaboratively by users
around the world is today the most used reference material in the world.

This one day seminar, "Software Patents and the Commons" will look at the
broad issue of "Commons" versus" Intellectual Property", and the  specific
issue of software patents,
We have a number of experts with us including *Prof. Eben Moglen, Dr. Zaki
Thomas, *Shri Madhukar Sinha, Shri T.C. James, etc.
We hope you will be with us in the Seminar on Software Patents and the
Commons.

it all depends on what is meant by a 'scripting language'. I had always
thought that a scripting language is one where there is no need to
compile the code in order to run it. But there seems to be a lot of
confusion about the term. Interpreted language also seems to be the same
- but again it looks like there is no agreement on the meaning of the
term. I call perl, python and ruby scripting languages simply because I
can write code and see the result at once without all sorts of compiling
and linking. But anyway there is nothing derogatory about calling a
language a scripting language.

Some people use this definition:
  scripting languages are designed for gluing: they assume the existence
  of a set of powerful components and are intended primarily for connecting
  components together

That paper generated a lot of controversy [1], but is worth reading.

Thank you for your help, Arun. I will follow Raja's advice as you
suggest. I resolved the problem by simply disconnecting the two devices
and using another single device which performs both the functions of the
router and modem.

When I previously used a separate modem and router this was what I did
(have two separate IP addresses) because it seemed logical. However,
this time it was the Airtel tech who set it up so I assumed he knew what
he was doing. Thanks for the explanation of why this happened.

Thanks for the advice, Raja. I've since replaced the two devices with
another single device that does both functions. However, I didn't think
of assigning the IP addresses in the way you've described.

Your method does seem overly comprehensive for a home network but I'll
follow it because it seems carefully thought out.

Thank you,

IMO, what Raja has suggested is sort of best practice in LAN topo
layout, irrespective of whether it is a home or a small office LAN.
Time and again, I have come across users shooting themselves in the
foot by assigning static IPs from a DHCP range!

Just curious - how long does the copy take assuming the HDD is hooked
up to an IDE/SATA port in the file server system?

But still it provides more info(rmation) than man pages for several GNU

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=V5SPsBo5kRN4gKLkYxXuxn+EDSDHs3u=y1iK0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I remember a thread here, asking for a data recovery tool in GNU/Linux. I
came across the following news today that version 1.13 of GNU ddrescue has
been released.

I have not used this tool. Anyway, I hope that sharing the news might help
someone. If anybody have already used this please update here.

GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool.

The homepage is at http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/ddrescue.html.

The sources can be downloaded from http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/ddrescue/ or
from your favorite GNU mirror.

This version is also available in lzip format. If your distro doesn't yet
distribute the lzip program, you can download it from
http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/lzip.html

The md5sums are:
0afc4130882a993772385629d1c0a32e  ddrescue-1.13.tar.gz
00cd788fbd6bc5a6205c3199f7557fda  ddrescue-1.13.tar.lz

This release is also GPG signed. You can download the signature by appending
".sig" to the URL.

Changes in version 1.13:

 * Non-regular output files are no more overwritten by default.

 * The option "--force", which forces overwriting of non-regular output
files has been added.

 * The option "--preallocate", which preallocates space on disc for the
output file has been added.

 * The command line used is now written to the logfile as information for
the user.

 * Even more warnings have been added to the tutorial in the manual.

 * Revert to use "long" instead of "time_t" for time variables. Ddrescue
only needs counting seconds and "time_t" causes warnings on some systems.

I see. I've now set up the network according to what Raja recommended
and have saved his email for further reference. Thank you both for your

Recently i connected a second 1TB SATA HDD and transferred the repository,
the data transfer rate was around 70MB/sec.

Software Freedom Day - Planning meeting

A planning meeting for SFD was held in MIT after Tamil Free Software
Conference on August 28, 2010

1. Raman
Usually, the visitors are colelge students and school children. We
need volunteers to work on attracting common people to the event. We
can inform our friends and contacts through email.

Advertising in magazines and newspapers will cost a lot. It is better
to use that money for some productive purpose. We can try to get news
reports about the event. For earlier events we could not get much
respone. Hope to be successful this time.

2. Srini agreed to send emails to IT companies about the event. We can
prepare a list of 50 companies, identify contacts through the mailing
list and send details of SFD event to them.

3. Srini agreed to co-ordinate creation of sfd.ilugc.in website. All
details about SFD will be posted here.

4. I agreed to get an article published in Puthiya Thalaimurai tamil
magazine through a friend.

5. MIT computer society took responsibility to desing logos, posters
and badges for the event promotion.

6. Anna Kannan who is a media professional suggested that we should
project the event as beneficial to youth. Most of the magazines and
news papers focus on youth segment. He agreed to edit our press
release to suit the tastes of press.

7. Akilan agreed to compile and design the hand out in tamil which
will be printed free of cost by Aazhi publishers.

8. I agreed to co-ordinate printing of bit notices, posters and
banners. Raman suggested that we can cover cost of these through
donations.

9. If someone is ready to take the risk, 200 T-shirts can be printed
for the event and sold to volunteers.

10. It is suggested that we can distribute hand notices to  generate
awareness in Kotturpuram and Adyar areas on September 17, 2010. Need
volunteers for that.

Hi all,

How to discover the mac address of machines in a network?

I need to discover the machines that are available just with only BIOS
installed (NO Operating System)

And I need to find the mac address of such machines that are up.

For machines which have an OS installed, you can use an nmap
ping sweep, or ARP request to get your local OS to learn other
MAC IDs.

Unless a machine starts transmitting any data on the network,
you can't find any information about it.

If your BIOS attempts PXE boot, you can capture the MAC ID
from the DHCP broadcast request.  Or if you have a managed
L2 switch, you can query its ARP table for list of all MAC IDs
it has learned.

PC BIOS has limited network support so you really need an OS
to do something more useful.

Not really.  man only provides a brief explanation of
commands/function-calls/etc while info provides
supplemental information which go far beyond man pages.

Eg. "man gcc" and "info gcc"


To OP:
pinfo is a friendly replacement to info.  Uses a lynx
style interface instead of Emacs style.

Hi,

Am sure no one in this list needs an introduction to the issue thats
important to the national security administration in India. Apparently, they
want to lay their hands on the encryption keys used by operators so that
they can listen in on any conversation on their networks.

But, how feasible it is for a savvy end user with enough resources at his
disposal (read terrorists, maoists etc) to install a small chip (say, an
FPGA) that is capable of encrypting (using 1024 bit keys, which are
exchanged via a personal courier) the signals even before it reaches the
network? Then, even with the govt having the official encryption keys, they
will still end up with a garbled msg they cannot decode in reasonable
time!!!

Would some electronic geeks on this list shed some light on the feasibility
of such a chip?

I feel the govts measure will eventually be only useful for listening on and
silencing 'dissidents' (usually ordinary people who stand up for their
rights).

regds,
mano

You dont need any electronics for this. The issue is not about users 
sending encrypted messages, it is about users sending cleartext messages.

Perhaps my post was not clear!

The issue is about bad guys sending encrypted (encrypted by them using some
electronic device even before the network operator's device gets the
opportunity to encrypt it) messages through a channel to which the govt
'thinks' it has access!

#ilugc at irc.freenode.in is not in our control and the one who
registered is not in reachable.
So, registered a new channel.

Channel : #ilugc-in
server : irc.freenode.net


You can use any IRC tool like pidgin, telepathy, chatzilla, or any other tool.
There is a web based tool also.
http://webchat.freenode.net/


For the beginners to IRD, here is a small intro.
http://25yearsofprogramming.com/blog/20071122.htm

Hope we can have nice discussions there.
See you all there.
Please feel free to share your thoughts on this.

Thanks.

What is the speed supposed on your plan?

Just as putting 5.5 liters in a 5 liter bottle is not feasible, you
cannot go beyond the physical limit of your broadband connection.
On the other hand BSNL may have higher speed plans which you can
upgrade to for extra money.
There are hw/sw solutions that will compress data (when possible) but
they need to be present at both end points of the link - in your case
the DSL modem in your premise and the BSNL tel. exchange.

The speed "thing" is between the BSNL DSL modem/router in your premise
and the BSNL tel. exchange,  Fedora is no where in that link.

Where is St Joseph's College?

I tried locating it at the website. In Contact Us page there is a map
which has names of nearby places only.  The college is in Pala and the
map shows Kottayam as the nearest city.  I guess it is in Kerala.

Please mention the city and state in your communication and also in
the website.

Best regards,

No one - not even Blackberry can realistically do much about messages 
that are encrypted by the sender.  Even if these messages cannot be 
decrypted - there may be of value to investigating agencies.  Just 
knowing that so and so sent encrypted messages to these persons and 
cleartext to these other persons. Having the keys enables the government 
to do surveillance at will rather than raise a warrant and approach RIM 
on a case by case basis.

I do not support the governments actions - just pointing out the scope.

As I understand, the government is not looking to listen-in ALL
communications through RIM servers. They want access as and when
required, presumably after going through the legal procedures.

If the server is outside India and messages are encrypted, there will
be no way for the government agencies to listen when warranted.

If an individual is sending/receiving encrypted messages, then the
government can just ask that individual when needed.

AFAIK, as per TRAI regulations, GoI only allows use of 40-bit
encryption, which is obsolete in other countries because it is easy to
crack. If you need to use higher bits, you need to get written
permission from the Government.

An old, but, useful article [1]. Not sure if things have changed since then.

I think, a warrant is needed for this kind of tapping! Or may be am being
too optimistic :-)

If the idea is to only identify that communication is happening between any
two individuals, why ask for the key at all!

IMO, this kind of tapping is useful for tactical purposes like when having
an encounter with maoists. Obviously, the govt cannot ask the involved
maoists the contents of their encrypted messages :-)

Ctrl+W also does the same (deletes word to left of cursor)

I also find these useful
CTRL+D - deletes character at cursor
ALT  +D  - deletes word to right of cursor
CTRL+A - moves cursor to beginning of line
CTRL+E - moves cursor to end of line
CTRL+F/B - Moves cursor forward/backward by one character

Hi all,
     The function of this script is used to print the aleurier_access.log
(apache log file) file content exactly.

require 'rubygems'
require 'apachelogregex'

format = '%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"'
  parser = ApacheLogRegex.new(format)

  File.readlines('aleurier_access.log').collect do |line|
  puts parser.parse(line)
end

What i like to do is
How to print individual set values?
for eg,
If I want to print the %h (remote host id) set values alone?
I want to sort %h set values?
Repeated host id to printed only once and also other unique host ids
values and store %h values in a database?

If your friend had decided, gone ahead and completed RHCE and
assuming that he passed the examination, I do not understand
the reason why he must think about switching to programming
as his career.

If he's still clueless about what he wants to do with his career, I
think he needs to spend more time in learning and focussing on
his immediate career goal. In a competitive market these days,
it just not enough to have "knowledge" on C/C++ to become a
programmer (unless he's a campus recruit of course).

Here are a couple of suggestions from my side:

First, ask your friend if he really likes programming more than
performing system administration tasks in the long run.

If he does "like" programming, then ask him if he can solve
logical problems efficiently - he will need to try this himself
(like trying to write a simple command/application on Linux
all by himself with his knowledge on C/C++).

If he's comfortable writing simple yet practically useful
programs and applications in C/C++ all by himself, he must
try reading the source code of any one application/program
from the several thousands bundled with Linux and try
to understand how they work and see if he can improvize them
or fix any pending issues/bugs. Its a long journey to begin
with - but its worth it.

If he feels competent enough to handle all of the above at ease,
he can take up programming as his career. But if he feels that
he can do better administering systems than writing code all
the time, he is better off sticking to administration. He can start
to explore in-depth administration concepts (Mail server
administration, Web administration (Apache httpd/tomcat, etc.),
Database administration (using MariaDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL)
and so on.

>From the long term career perspective - whether he becomes
an administrator or a developer - as long as he is skilled and
dedicated, the prospects are equally good.

To put it in simple words - ask your friend to sit and give it a
thought on "what really interests him" and focus on what his
interests are and trying to accomplish enough skills and
knowledge in that area.

Also, tell him NOT to go by "market trends" and "peer pressure"
in choosing his career.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

Excellent advice, Chandrasekar.

RHCE is squarely targeted at sys admins.   If he chooses to be a
programmer, it isn't going to help much.

Adding to all the other good advice:

Ask your friend to take responsibility for his own destiny and ask his
questions himself!!!

Wake on Lan would be surely there. PXE boot needs manual/ requies agent(OS)
which is not possible.

NO, I won't have access to the machines,

I am developing a system that involves a part of Baremetal Provisioning for
which i need to find the baremetal resources (with mac as identifier).
