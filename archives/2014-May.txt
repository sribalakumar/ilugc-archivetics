Subject: [Ilugc] Ansible - Manage all your servers like a king
Message-ID: <CAND2797mafX2GyUT=JCK6DiJ5f6yahhPWEj+cgwO=1GZB0u=2w@mail.gmail.com>

Today, I attended GeekNight meeting, run by ThoughtWorks Chennai.
http://twchennai.github.io/geeknight/


The topics were *docker and ansible.*

I missed the docker talk, as I started late to the event.

Here are my notes about Ansible.

*Ansible* is a Free/Open Source configuration management system.

Just imagine, you have to install apache or lamp server in 200 servers.
or delete all the logs folder or upgrade or remove any package.

Logging into each server manually via ssh and doing all the things is a
tired job.

Here comes these Configuration management softwares like puppet, chef,
ansible, salt, cfengine etc.

Puppet and Chef are running as client/server model.
You have to run puppet/chef damenons in all the 200 servers.

In your computer, you have to write some configuration files with the
commands to run and the list of servers to run the commands.

Execute these files with the puppet/chef client from your computer.
It will take to the puppet/chef servers running on the 200 servers and
execute the commands.

Interesting, Right?

Here, the ansible differs.
There is no client/server architecture.

All the magics are done by just ssh connections.

You have to set the passwordless ssh connections to all the 200 servers
from your computer by sharing the keys.

Thats all. You are ready to run your favourite commands via ansible.

Ansible is a Gene, who can run the commands in all 200 servers by logging
to them via ssh.

List of servers and activities are written in plain text files in YAML
format.

It seems very simple then the chef/puppet.There are very good documentation
and tutorial available on internet.

Some links to explore:

http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html
http://docs.ansible.com/intro_getting_started.html
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-create-ansible-playbooks-to-automate-system-configuration-on-ubuntu

There are paid enhancements for ansible named Ansible Tower, Ansible Galaxy
etc. They provide a web GUI for handling these tasks.
For a GNU/Linux lover, who enjoys the powers of commandline, the plain
Ansible core is great enough.



Explore Ansible and share your experiences here.

Hi all,

I have been looking for long to have a documentary on Free Software
pioneers of India. I believe its high time we document their life,
contributions to the Free Software movement of India.
People like Kenneth Gonzalves, Atul Chitnis have been my inspiration.
Attending Foss.in, fossconf at Madurai have been phenomenal in turning me
towards free software movement and in turn a free software developer.
Can members provide a plan/idea to take up this?

Subject: [Ilugc] Book Review - Getting Started with OpenShift
Message-ID: <CAND2795Unn+Nv-oLKVuf+grmHMxFLhwh=_XMuFfsndUfHxXwoQ@mail.gmail.com>

Ater I bought Kindle Ebook reader, I got my reading habit back.
Started to read many Tamil books from FreeTamilEbooks.com and
Technical books.

Most of the English books are avaible in Epub, Mobi and PDF formats.

Recently, I downloaded the Ebook "Getting Started with OpenShift" for free
from the following site.

https://www.openshift.com/promotions/ebook

Books comes in epub,mobi and PDF format.

Thanks for the authors Steven Pousty and Katie J. Miller and O'Reilly for
the nice book.


In the cloud computing, there are many AAS jargans.
PAAS, IAAS, SAAS, etc.

PAAS - Platform as a Service - Gives all the software development
libraries/environment as service. -
Example - Google App Engine, OpenShift

No need to take care of OS. Manage only applications and libraries.


IAAS - Infratructue as a Service - Gives all the operating systems as
service. - Amazon Web Service, Google Cloud Platform.

You have to manage all the OS and packages, software installed.


SAAS - Software as a Service - Gives just software for use. - Gmail,
Flickr, Facebook.
No need to manage anything. Just Use it.

Experts keep on  adding "As a Service" for any tech jorgan.

Who knows? In Future we may hear words like Food as a service, Heart as a
Service :-)


This books introduces the AAS basics.

OpenShift is Redhat's open source PAAS platform.
OpenShift Origin is Free Software and you can implement in your own
environment,

They have the basics jargons - Gears, Catridges.

Gear is a minimal shell environment with minimal RAM ( 512 MB), 1GB
harddisk and with minimal CPU.

Catridge is the library/application/framework required for software
development like Django, Ruby On Rails, PHP, Cron, Pear, Perl, Jboss etc.

Redhat gives 3 gears for free.

In their hosted paid plans, we can get more powerful and high storage gears.




Git is the basic version control system.
Once we set the gears and catridges, we can start developing in our local
system.
Once we push the code to the git master repo,  the code is deployed on the
redhat's cloud.


We can add more catridges like Jenkins for Continious Integration and
deployment.
There are many catridges developed by the community.

Database servers can be managed by simple commands.

SSh login is provided for the gears.
But we can do most of the works within our local git repo.

Snapshots and backups of the gears are so easy.
Auto scaling is provided by default.

This book explores all the above said, with deploying a simple Python/Flask
based web application.


The books gives a good overview of how the applications should be developed
and deployed in the PAAS environments.


Rollout the OpenShift PAAS in your environment and provide the developers
100s of boxes for their development and testing.

?Does Kindle support Tamil natively now?  I have the 3rd generation one
which only supports English. For other languages PDF is required which is
pain to read from.

Subject: [Ilugc] Perl for algorithms
Message-ID: <CALDskyxF-_NwN7ZiCwKc20c3wCL8YdcazqdgTV5uz7gzoY+30Q@mail.gmail.com>

The purpose of programming is usually to achieve some real life objective.

To solve some mathematical problem or to implement some idea.

Perl is a very pleasant language to do these things.

Like all good things, like all complex things you have to learn its syntax to
unlock its power.

Perl has a few data types called scalars, arrays and hashes.

You have to get some familiarity with the various $ signs and @ signs
 you see in a perl program.

Functions can be called from anywhere and global variables are the
norm as perl is a a scripting language.

I have always used it to my advantage for a really long time, mainly
for doing web CGI, even to do some UNIX daemons to talk to UNIX domain
sockets for doing backend work, to do some text processing and to
generate arbitrary text output.

The CPAN archive(www.cpan.org) is very useful because perl has a rich
library of readymade tools and APIs you can use to solve tough
problems.

Just want to clarify, A gear is like a VM and if it got all the
libraries and tools required to run Node.js 0.10, then you can say you
are running 'nodejs-0.10' cartridge in that gear.

OpenShift provides 3 free gears and you have lot of cartridges to run on
those 3 gears like 'ruby-1.9', 'php-5.4', 'perl-5.10', 'mysql-5.5',
'mongodb-2.4','haproxy-1.4' etc.,

Apart from git, you have to install rhc (red hat client) to manage your
openshift activities through commandline. rhc is a ruby app can be
installed using gems.

Well, this is one of the place where you can have your own website
without spending money. I have mine.

PS: apart from openshift, there are lot of paas providers, this link
explains better (notable are heroku, appfog)

Message-ID: <CAND2795ia2WwJ=uZQbbP=X8Kyy6QXAoet1pNjEL72=ja2DAOAw@mail.gmail.com>

We are creating ebooks in Tamil in epub,mobi,6 Inch PDF, A4 PDF formats
and releasing them at http://FreeTamilEbooks.com


We get the content as blogger.com or wordpress.com blogs or as Word
Documents.

We use http://PressBooks.com to generate these epub/mobi ebooks.
We have to copy the each blogpost as new chapters.
Once copied all the required blog posts, we can export them as ebooks.

The entire process is here.
http://goinggnu.wordpress.com/2014/02/01/how-to-create-an-ebook-for-free-tamil-ebooks-com/

Video in Tamil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXNBwGUDhRs


The process seems simple. Just copy/Paste and export.
Each book may take 20-30 min for all the copy/paste works.

I am looking for a web application to convert the given wordpress/blogger
url into a epub.

The requirements are as below.

1. Input : URL of a wordpress or blogger blog. URL may contain categories
too. Users should give a list of various blogpost url from various sites
too.

2. Get the RSS feed from the given url

3. parse the Feed and list all the posts available.

4. user should pick the desired articles to convert as epub.

5. Get the details like Book name, author name, license text, cover image

6. Generate epub for download.

7. If possible give in mobi format too.

8. themes/Custom themes  will be fine. But not essential.


Once this application is done, we can host it and provide a free ebook
conversion service.



Anyone interested in doing this application, contact me.

Thanks.

<http://localhost/otrs/customer.pl> page.*

     I am installed otrs in ubuntu virtual machine. I am changing otrs log
through
*Admin -> SysConfig -> Frontend:customer*

     I was copy my own logo into "*httpd/htdocs/skin/customerdefault//img*"
and change my sysconfig customer logo url as "
*skins/Customer/default/img/mylogo.png*".

     But still it does not show my custom logo.

Mr.Somasundaram told me that there are two venues for the workshop, one at
the foot hills of kalvarayan hills and  another at up the  hills. I
requested Mr.Soma sundaram for class room and a projector and (if possible

Subject: Call for help from KDE Team
To: debian-devel at lists.debian.org


Hi all!

For quite a while now the KDE team has been severely understaffed. We maintain
a lot of packages, with many different kinds of bugs, but we don't have enough
people to do all the work that needs to be done. We have tools that help us
automate the update to new upstream releases, but that's just the tip of the
iceberg of our work and so we are writing to invite more people to get
involved in the team and help us get KDE software in Debian into better shape.

Some of the tasks that we need help with are:

 + Bug triaging: there are many many bugs in the BTS. We need people that go
   through them, understand the problem and how to reproduce it, confirm
   that they are still present in the latest versions. In particular, there
   are bugs affecting the version in wheezy, and we need people to go through
   those as well.

 + Bug forwarding: we are so understaffed that we have been asking users to
   forward the bugs upstream themselves. Some users do this, but some don't.
   It would help us a lot to have people in the team in charge of this.

 + Patch forwarding: we have quite a bunch of patches applied in the Debian
   packages that should be applied upstream. Some need to be generalized
   instead of being Debian-specific. This work would save us time in the
   future, so it's very important to get it done.

 + Upgrade-testing: in the past, the upgrade from one Debian stable to the
   other has been quite traumatic for KDE software users. We need people to
   try upgrading from wheezy to jessie and report any bugs that they might
   encounter so that we can fix them ahead of the release.

 + Creating patches: many of the bugs that we have require writing patches,
   some are easy and some are harder, but any help here would be really
   appreciated.

 + Packaging other KDE apps: we have packages for the core components of KDE
   software, but there are many other useful components that still need to
   get packaged.

 + Updating our welcoming wiki page [1], adding these tasks and any future
   tasks, and unifying the todo lists [2].

If you are interested in helping with any of these, please join our irc
channel #debian-qt-kde in irc.oftc.net, or our mailing list [3]. We are happy
to help you get started.

It may be difficult for me to come up with such questions or interview them
directly, I being from Bangalore.
So, lets start with documenting each person, how (s)he was introduced to
FOSS, what motivates, whats the contribution,
how the community is now, how it should be in future, etc.

Banana Pi was quoted at $60 in some article.

Given that RPi is about 24 months old, newer SoC based boards are bound to
come up soon. The price range of RPi like SoC based SBCs have been in the
$60-$100 range with better speeds /RAM.

hi all,

as some (or many) might be aware, I am part of the faculty for M.Sc
(CS-FOSS) online course, offered by Anna University. For the subject
DIF7102 (Philosophy and Practice of FOSS), I could give the info about
10-15 foss contributors as assignment to the students for documentation /
collation, and share the info giving them the credit (with some editing, if
needed).

towards this, i would request you to send me (to srini.it at gmail.com), the
links / references / info about the indian foss contributors. at present i
would like do info collation on the following 15 persons (selection based
on my own personal knowledge / interaction) :
Atual Chitnis, Kenneth Gonsalves, Raj Mathur  -- in memorium
Shakthi Kannan, Raman, T. Shrinivasan, Bharathi Subramanian, Thyagarajan,
Baskar, Girish, Welkin
Dr. Gora Mohanty, Narendra Sisodaya, Frederick Noronha, Sankarshan
Mukhopadhyay

I know there are many more -- would like to collect the links/references,
and hope to work on the info later.
thanks and best wishes

Subject: [Ilugc] intrusion detection thro' bro
Message-ID: <CALDskyz-UY=KJeDt3DbUYa77sv8YLzry-6dv=S_K9p-AZAEiAg@mail.gmail.com>

We all know snort, at least heard of it.

One guy in ILUGC runs his life on snort alarms coming to his bank network.

Intrusion detection is all about alerting or getting alerted or logging packets.

Usually attacks come from the Internet and they target vulnerabilities or
 easy passwords or just try a denial of service or port scans.

It is not so easy to spot attacks but with intrusion detection software it is
possible with some effort.

snort is the industry standard, it is open source, but it is a signature
based system and some of the signatures are not free.

Bro is another software that does the same thing but in a completely different
 way.

Bro is more of an anomaly detector as opposed to a packet signature matcher.

It therefore looks for events and bro comes pre built with 1000s of scripts
 in its own programming language which I am trying to learn but it is somewhat
 hard.

Bro can also understand netflow and it has several pluggable modules.

Bro can be made to log packet decodes as well as execute functions
thereby making it an intrusion prevention software as well.

I am now doing a project involving bro and though I lack practical knowledge
 of using it I am sure a lot of you do not know beyond snort and IDS.

So I thought I could introduce bro.

I am sure it is better than snort in a lot of ways.

It is highly customizable and is also quite old being a research project
 from USA.

Snort is from Israel.

Anyway since I will get paid only after I do my project using bro I will surely
 have to learn it.

Bro is a highly configurable intrusion detection tool that can be used not
 just for this purpose but also for several things with its scripts.

Hi Ganesh,

Thanks for the response :-)  ..FYI.. Currently we using nagios to monitor
linux servers. From nagios we are monitoring only basic things about
jboss.. but we need to monitor only the whole process about the jboss
servers... tools like app dynamics..

Message-ID: <CAND2797r8vok41WLbpU=dJ6fJ84_kkHi4RzNZm-DQXpp11zDTQ@mail.gmail.com>

There are many good events happening around chennai.

There are Hackathons, Public Talks, Books Fairs, Many Software users group
meetings, Free Trainings, Workshops etc.

Many people share the events in their own mailing lists, web sites,
facebook, event sites like event brite etc.

There is no single common place to see the all.

I am imagining a Google Calendar with all public events, added by a group
of people.

The advantages of Google Calenders are

1. Email Notification
2. SMS notification
3. Multi user authoring
4. Subscription to other calendar tools

In my search, no other tool/site/software is giving these features.

Here is the plan.

1. Create Google Calendar
2. Share it with a group of interested people.
3. They can add the events they come to know in this calendar
4. Anyone can subscribe to this calender to get notifications.



Will this work well?

Is there any other better platform to achieve this?

Please share your thoughts.

Reply here, if you are interested to join the team.

Thanks.

Have you set this in ~/.bash_profile or ~/.etc_profile and sourced it
from ~/.bash profile? How are you logging in as jboss user? What are
the permissions of the ~/.etc_profile file?

sudo permission , i am getting the error  is " Your wireless card or driver
does not support Access Point mode" .

My laptop hardware configuration is DELL VOSTRO 2420. I checked the
wireless with lwconfig , the output is :

** Do not top post ** follow the list guidelines for posting and follow ups.

The above error indicates that your WiFi card does not support "AP
Mode"   with the default installation.
Some WiFi cards require additional firmware to support AP Mode.   You
will have to search for Broadcom firmware packages for your card.

Hi,

I did not asked to share your calendar with any of us.

I asked for volunteers to add events in a public calendar.

The task is you have to monitor various sites and list.
If you find any good event, you have to create an event in that common
calendar.

Reply here if you are interested in these tasks.

We don't want your personal calendars to share with anyone.

Please read the mails before taking some action.

Thanks.

Hello everyone,

In one of my centOS system, lately I changed it's hostname and my user lost
it's sudo rights. I tried to add this user again with usermod -a -G wheel
test_user and with visudo I commented out "%wheel  ALL=(ALL)  ALL" but
nothing is changing.

Any suggestion?

which kernel module is loaded for this device? if it is wl, then you are
screwed, broadcom sucks!!

# lspci -k

ps: I too have this broadcom crap in my laptop, but thankfully, kernel
have a open driver for my chip BCM4313 (brcm80211). I checked yours, but
as far as I searched, there is no open driver for BCM4365. If you find a
open driver, or able to use wl in AP mode, then let us know.

Thanks,
Mohan R

Hi,

This might be coz of sudoers file which might be corupted for some reason
or ur system unable to read sudoees file .....

Try the following....
Check if you have any invalid or extra char in sudoers file

Try mannuly changing the file permission

If you have any group permission im sudoers file remove that and add just
user level permission and execute the file (ie) remove isergroups from wheel

Finally cp sudoers file from other centos box to rhis one and try using
that ... This final step will  fix ur problem...

Rg,
Sathya

Hmmm... SELinux; it should be "disabled"; I will check. But awesome point,

Is this a valid domain?

$ whois techhartus.com

Whois Server Version 2.0

Domain names in the .com and .net domains can now be registered
with many different competing registrars. Go to http://www.internic.net

No match for "TECHHARTUS.COM".

Hey friends,

*LXDE, Razor-Qt merge to create awesome LXQt project*

?May the fork be with you? is a term we often hear in the free software
community as it?s extremely easy to take the code and fork it to scratch
your etch. What?s really difficult (and that?s something really counts) is
to actually come together, collaborate and merge code-base to create
something which helps more people, which is not just about scratching your
own itch, but to do something which benefits more and more people.

That?s exactly two awesome free software communities have done. LXDE and
Razor-Qt communities have merged their efforts to create what they aptly
call LXQt. The communities have announced LXQt 0.7.0, the first release of
LXQt, the Qt Lightweight Desktop Environment.

Hi.

If the regular LUG meeting is on after all, it would be great to have
another iteration of the Open Hardware talk, only this time with actual
examples of the hardware available at the meeting to touch and feel.

I believe at the last meeting Ganesh from CSIR said he could bring the
actual hardware, and maybe talk more on actually using/programming them, as
compared to the more theoritical / introductory talk last month.

It would be really cool IMO if that talk happened, whether at this month's
meeting or next month. If this month's meeting is happening, then I would
prefer it this month of course. :)

Regards
Amartyo

1) Is this framework which you are talking  about is free and opensource?
if so url to the source please.
2) If #1 is true, I would request the speaker to confine only to the
software  and not the company.

Hello All,

>>Simple PHP framework called TAF

I requested the presenter to let us know about the source code repository
url and  license part of the software.

ilugc is meant for promoting free and open source softwares and will be
glad to know the url to the source and license part of the software.
Without knowing this much about the software and including in the itinerary
of the forth coming  meet is surprising to me.

regards

Thyagarajan Shanmugham

Karthikeyan is part of my team. Let me explain the position of TAF.

TAF is a bunch of loosely arranged PHP files and simple modules that help
RAD. This  is based on our experience over years developing PHP
applications, and the needs of Indian companies looking forward to develop
their own applications.

The idea of the talk is to put forth the best practices, and encourage
others to benefit from our experience. We also want to plan to open the
source code under a GPL-ish license (in fact, I dont mind sharing the code
right now) and one of the planned items was to call for volunteers to
open-source it and maintain it, with the Techartus team actively adding
modules.

ILUGC moderators: I do not understand why theres such a venomous outpour
once we say a company is involved. I expect volunteers to be treated better
than with a suspicious tone like the one used here. I hope you will respond
back and encourage volunteers instead of stifling them.

Regards,
Madan

Hi

>>ILUGC moderators: I do not understand why theres such a venomous outpour
once we say a company is involved. I expect volunteers to be treated better
than with a suspicious tone like the one used here. I hope you will respond
back and encourage volunteers instead of stifling them.

First to start with

a) I am not a ILUGC moderator but a ordinary member .

b) there is no venomous outpour, it is just requesting.

c) IMHO there is no rules here to say where the  volunteering ends and
where the company advertisement starts and hence requested the speaker to
focus on the software and not on the company. It is just a request.

d) Many volunteers who hinted of 'TOP POSTING'  are been treated as rule
enforcers by some, at this instance such so called 'enforcer' vanished
either losing interest or in fear of getting  branded as 'rule enforcers'.
I am not sure the following will be felt stifling that asking  where is the
url to the source and what is the license. The reason for asking is that it
will help the attendees to go through the code and be prepared for the
session and clear the doubts and  share their ideas of expansion.

e) my personal take is announcing the code in public license and then
coming to the community will serve mutual benefit.
Doing the other way is putting the cart before the horse.

Those are my expectation as a member.

best regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Subject: [Ilugc] Company Promotions
Message-ID: <536C3418.3040704@gmail.com>

Hello Group,

In a way Mr. Thayagarajan is right. Company promotion must be kept out 
of pure free software groups. It now called Bootstrap, not Twitter 
Bootstrap; its now called Gears not Google Gears.

I have at most respect to him. I knew ILUGC because of him, and because 
of ILUGC I am in a job which I enjoy. I wish people would cut through 
the glare and see Mr. Thayagarajans commitment to free software. this 
cuting through glare is simply absent in many Indian free software 
groups. Wonder why? People don't seems to realize unbounded and open 
minds are the greatest contributors to free software (or any other art 
form). Possibly because people in such groups are emailers and talkers 
rather than true contributors who write code.

The next thing is about enforcing rules. We are all Indians. We were 
brought up in way where we were told to do this and not that and blah 
blah. Its in our blood to think some thing is right and others are 
wrong. This sick mentality is truly making many people in this group and 
in groups like chennai.rb brand some people as evil. I hope we come out 
this rule enforcing thing.

Hope democracy, free speech and art of ignorance which we cynically lack 
prevail in ILUGC.

         From the article, it is the last line that is quite important
to anyone who talks about creating the next best text editor - "it
needs to learn everything that 1976 has to teach???not just the lesson
of Emacs, but also the lesson of vi." I don't think I could have put
it as succinctly.

       Again thinking, will it not be possible to write a Emacs lisp
functions that would let us delete/copy/cut till end of  paragraph
etc. ? I somehow think it should be possible. Thanks

Haha good one!

Over the years I have come across Linux certified (the most popular
one) individuals in India, who came with distinguished marks in the
certification exams, but could not answer more than 15 questions out
50; that were derived from the syllabus of the very first module in
the certification training!

One chap told me to give him one week and that he would "smash" my
questionnaire!  I told him that next week he would get an entirely
different questionnaire and he was welcome to come back - he never
did.

I make it a point not to hire people who say they are certified.

Please check the OP, there are 2 'h' there.  It must have been a typo.
  Follow ups to the email id mentioned in the OP (with 2 'h' ) would

Yes, in glug-kol list, Mandar pointed out this command

and also said

I think the author is seeing it from a design perspective and design
has its subjective aspects. Yes, of course Emacs has Lisp and the
author's example is not so sound.

The question is "what is immediately accessible?"

There is a command line application called "gtypist" that offers
tutorials for both QWERTY and DVORAK layouts.

You can install it by:

$ sudo apt-get install gtypist

Sir,
I and my daughter are interested in learning about open software and we
wished to participate in the workshop at Kallakurichi.
My daughter is doing II year B.tech-cse in Sastra University.As she had
semester exams in those days(10/05 and 11/5) you have mentioned earlier we
could not register for the workshop.Since now the dates(3rd week of may)
have been changed we can conveniently attend the workshop.So kindly
provide me the information regarding the workshop and also the contact
details.(phn no.).






My phn no.7598489643


                                             Thank you

  Dear all,

We had our ILUGC monthly meet this Saturday(10-05-2014).

About 12 people attended this meet.

I have given a talk in Gnucash accounting software based on personal 
accounting  perspective .

Then we had Ganesh giving talk on open source hardware. He brought the 
boards(Arduino, Beaglebone etc) and explained how we can take data in 
real time. He showed some sensors by which we can get our own personal 
data and we can analyze with that data. It was more about systems 
integration.

Baskar explained how a very old computer can be used like a media 
center(xbmc media center) by remote booting by pxc port and openelec distro.

We had a Nice session and then we went to canteen and had a discussion.


We also had feedback from the people that the need some talks which can 
be used in day to day world. Topics in effective use of VI editor, Using 
of irc chat etc.
We thank the speakers and people for your time.

Gowtham Raam.J

Greetings All,

I want to buy a tablet and my budget is upto ?30,000 (not above than this).
Kindly guide me which one should I go for:

*Android* or *iOS* (I know its not an Open Source but mostly based on Unix)

I have heard that Samsung tablets are not good in performance. Is it true?

Please share your experiences.

Looking forward.

Thank you.

*P.S. :* Please do not divert this mail to another direction that why have
I mentioned Apple (closed source OS). I am asking for suggestions.

Mainly, my use will be for surfing and watching videos (especially TED) and

documents, reading e-books and try using my hands on others things. :)

These days, you can't impress your girlfriends. The time you will try to
impress them they will change their requirements. :P (jokes apart)

There are white box no brand tablets with calling option for 15000 Rs with 10" screen size and USB for kbd and mouse.

Android is best except there are no good apps to create documents. Some tablets give you Linux OS as an option but no means to make calls. I will check that and update.

Nexus 7 2013 edition is reasonable. Good for watching video and
reading (high dpi). You can get custom ROM easily if you prefer. You
will also get regular OS updates. Worth the money.

Hope this helps,

Don't go for Samsung or Nexus or Asus Transformer tablets.

You can get custom built tablets at ridiculously low prices from here:

http://www.uplaytablet.com/product/uplay-tablet-t931-9-white-label-tablet-dual-core-1024x600-hd-screen-dual-cameras/

After all taxes and duties, you will get very good tablet for less than 12,000/-

I have an ASUS 7" model.  It has a Quad Core Tegra CPU.   There is a
micro SD slot for additional storage.  The display is better than
Galaxy (Dual core).   It does all of the above without a sweat.   Do
buy a stylus.  I bought it in the US for $160 (with tax).

Impressing others works some of the time at best.   Be what you are --

I have a Nexus 7 2013 and for reading e-books (which is my main use
case) I feel it would've been better if I went for one with a wider
screen (in portrait mode). Other than that its a good one.

@Arun Sir: I searched on your mentioned product and found this:

http://www.asus.com/in/Tablets_Mobile/ASUS_Fonepad_7_ME372CG/specifications/

Please confirm.

On the other side, as of now I have one more product in my cart which is:
Apple ipad Mini with Wi-Fi + Cellular (16GB)

http://www.flipkart.com/apple-16gb-ipad-mini-wi-fi-cellular/p/itmdfymkvgb6ma3q

Please advice me is it worth buying a product or not.

My unit has Tegra ARM Quad core CPU.  The above is Intel Atom.   My
unit does not have any provision for a GSM SIM card, the model in your
link does.

Overall, it looks good.  A GSM data SIM would give you net access
whereas I am dependent on WiFi.

I am not much of an fan for Apple products - expensive IMO.  I'd
rather use the money saved for some other use.

Overall, I believe there are more apps on Google Play, a good number
free.  I am using my tablet as a SIP phone, Wi Fi Analyzer (for quick
site survey), QR / Bar code (read/generate), IP calculator and more
...

A tablet is definitely worth it.  I do not carry my laptop on most
client site visits.

Yes,  I want a tablet which gives me internet on the move. But I am afraid
to buy an Intel Atom processor tablet. Will it be a worth spending item?
Will it bring performance issues?

You're right. Apple is no doubt costly as comparison to others.
Again right, there is no dearth of Apps on Google Play Store. Else on Apple
we have to pay in $.

Undoubtedly, tablet is a worth spending product thats why seeking for
suggestions before investing my money on it.

To: "Kubuntu Developer Discussion" <kubuntu-devel at lists.ubuntu.com>

Hello everyone!

It has been a while since I've been in contact with the open source
community. Between finishing my PhD and getting a job, my life has been
very busy. However, I have continued to think about open source communities
while I have been away. For example, like the study I am currently running.

Desktop notifications are a service to help you maintain awareness of
applications and services running in the background. Love them or hate
them, they provide an essential service that we cannot live without. The
first Desktop Notification Study focused on the KDE community. Results of
the study provided interesting insight to what makes a notification good or
bad.

The current study expands the focus to all Free/Libre/Open Source Software
communities. Tell me about the most recent notification you received and
help me understand what makes a notification good or bad across the board.

http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1655301/Desktop-Notification-Survey-Open-Source

For each completed survey, *the project will donate $1 USD* to one of the
following projects (you choose): KDE, Gnome, Free Software Foundation, Free
Software Foundation Europe, and the Apache Foundation.

Spread the word and share with your friends, earning donations to your
favorite FLOSS project along the way!

Cheers,

~ Celeste Lyn Paul <http://www.kde.org>

Subject: [Ilugc] some common Linux commands
Message-ID: <CALDskywX5YfxJ07wceUL2p5MrxDn_xUcKJT0YPnohm9sT28TNw@mail.gmail.com>

Lot of people in LUG think only Linux exists.

So let me focus on Linux. Though this mail applies to all those UNIX flavors
 out there.

Usually everybody needs an editor.

And most people hate Linux because of vi or vim.

But that is the most brilliant creation and is extremely productive if
you learn it
 and start to love it.

There are people who love emacs as well.

There are other alternatives these days like nano which I never use.

grep is a very useful tool to sift through text lines to pick out lines of
 interest.

It is so commonly used that it has almost become an English word.

There are some mail clients, most people prefer graphical ones like
 thunderbird.

But I use a software called mutt.

It is extremely powerful and integrates very well with an editor like vim.

Along with syntax highlighting and include_headers switch it is very powerful.

Then a tool I love a lot is netcat, used for TCP,UDP and UNIX sockets server
 and client testing.

If you have a lot of files that come from Windows world with spaces
and funny characters you can use mmv for moving files en masse and
renaming them to adhere to UNIX conventions.

Then you have the youtube-dl python script to download youtube videos
for offline watching.

mplayer for playback of multimedia, audio and video files.

scp,ssh and ftp like pure-ftpd server for anonymous file serving, lftp
client and so on.

rsync is also useful for transfer of files between locations that
require suspend resume over bad connections and for large files.

Over a period of time you settle at certain tools that can improve
your working in a significant way.

A programmer will use make and revision control like darcs, git or cvs.

I also use the at command for tasks that I want the computer to do
without my help.

But that is rare and only for downloads or uploads.

I have no idea about Android on Intel x86 platform.  There are rumour
that some of the Android apps do not work well on x86 Android.

You may inquire on the Android forums.

For personal  devices, I set a cap of $500 - 600 absolute max; the
devices are already obsolete even before you open the box.  At
personal level, I find more value for money on the Android platform.

Let us know what you end up buying and your experiences with it.

If you can elaborate why, the feedback could be useful in improving the book.

There are quite a few mistakes in the book.

Example: See the watermarks folder.

The .tex file uses line breaks at end of paragraph.

Crude indents.

Package list is ridiculous for the purpose of demonstrating watermarks.

references are used in the wrong way.
__________________________________


The book is likely to misguide beginners.

Users with some experience will find all kind of faults and may
appreciate a few snippets.

Teachers will not find it useful. Existing books are far better.

* Users with some familiarity will want help by contexts that include
a set of environments and/or light packages - the book has missed out
on this by a long margin.

It will not be useful for TeXnicians.

* What is the shortcoming in available books that the book seeks to fill?

Is the book written according to the principle: "you know LaTeX, if
you can improve all of the .tex files in this collection"?

Thanks. Do pass the word on - We are hoping to help as many people as we
can over the next few months. Hopefully, this vocational training will
encourage people to become self-employed, when they dont get placed through
college.

To: chennai-testing at googlegroups.com,

Hi All,

I've created an open source project "Py-Runner" and its source is available
"https://github.com/parthibann/Py-Runner".

It provides web-ui for python unittest framework, using that you can select
test cases from web and it generates html reports.

It is also integrated with testlink so the automation test results are
automatically updated to testlink.


Thanks and Regards,
Parthiban.N

Ubuntu live cd/usb didn't configured to use Aufs. Try Debian
http://live.debian.net/ or puppylinux/slax/dsl/<any linux distro which
uses Aufs>.

Afaik, the Ubuntu USB disk creator tool (or whatever the name of the
tool is) supports storing files in a persistent area of the live USB.

Please try Universal USB installer which has an option to set a persistent
file size for storing changes.

Yes, it is possible.  IMO, your use case scenario is no different than
doing the same on bare metal.

With a Live CD + a 'raw' disk image (file), you can partition the
'raw' virtual disk and untar your tar ball. Install a boot loader in
the 'raw' virtual disk and you should be ready to boot with the 'raw'
virtual disk.

You can create a raw image of the file system (for example) using:

  # dd if=/dev/sda of=hard-disk.img

Most hypervisors have utilities to convert the virtual disk image formats.

What I understood from Zico's OP is that he has the entire OS
installation in a tar ball (I have used this method for bare metal
installs).  Now he wants to create a bootable virtual disk image with
the OS installation coming from the tar ball.

@ Zico - please clarify use case scenarios i.e. what do you have and
where do you want to go with it; break it up into a list items.

Well, I can think of this: Create a virtual box using this tar ball
similar to how you do with bare metal.

You need to know SQL queries, installation of MySQL, upgrade,
backup and restore, users management, and performance.

Read the tamil book on MySQL here.

MySQL is a relational database.  Administering MySQL or for that
matter any database is called Database Administration or DBA for
short.   A DBA's job is very different from that of a Linux System
Administrator's job.   A DBA must know a fair amount of DB theory and
it's implementations in products like MySQL.  DBA is a good career
option, but beware, you will be in high demand cleaning up other
people's mess.

First learn about DB theory, then the specifics in MySQL.  There is
plenty of good material on dev.MySQL.com.

IMO, your approach is incorrect.   Are you really interested in MySQL
or learning it for the sake of getting an interview? The clueless
recruiter may be able to get you the interview.  Believe me you will
not get very far in the interview, if you learn to hack a few MySQL
commands.

I don't like linux actually. I love it. Linux is my future. In my home town
some people don't know what is linux and open source, I teach them as much
as possible. I'm so keen on attending the monthly meet, but unfortunately
my residence is not in chennai. Will attend soon..I need your support for
me forever. Thanks and regards.

http://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/200-libby-clark/773488-opw-intern-develops-qr-code-for-linux-kernel-oops-messages

Good to see females in Linux community.

And, please share your experiences for newcomers (like me) who would like
to learn about Kernel and its nitty gritty details. What are the possible
ways to be familiar with Kernel details (like hooking, patching, debugging
and others)?

Looking forward.

Thank you.

Laudable.  IIRC, there are similar guidelines for adoption of FOSS
solutions.  Take for example BOSS Linux by CDAC.

The comments show a different ground reality.

Start with building a custom kernel from www.kernel.org, going through
the options (zillions).   Then try patching it with device drivers
from hardware vendors, where the driver is not in the official kernel.
   Test your custom kernel with the driver.

Much of the above is moot because the distributions do a fantastic job
in patching the official kernel to make our job easier!   But ... it
will give you a feel for the complexities.

If patching device drivers seems difficult, then I suggest patching
filesystems which is not in the official kernel for learning /
experimenting.

The "htmldoc" program should accomplish what you want. It can be downloaded
from synaptic.

Message-ID: <CALDskyybkdXRKgAAQ0m5qyzB3p3x4ZB8kCMqY=fHVE1--HQGaw@mail.gmail.com>

The way I see it and anticipate the future I think cloud computing
will certainly
 not replace existing IT infrastructure.

I have been living in really remote locations in TN and the Internet
connectivity and bandwidth are both pretty good.

And these days offices are becoming very different from the olden days.

We have distributed workforce and everything can be done remotely by
different people sitting in different timezones and different
countries.

And cloud computing is enabling this cultural shift in a big way.

It also means work from home in a sense.

Or even work from a remote resort if you prefer. Or even an island.

I don't think satellite Internet is in any way becoming prevalent in India.

I shall await BSNL to give me a plan with it. ;)

Cloud computing basically means accessing IT services like mail,
document work, corporate Intranet services like salary services, pay
slip views, accessing build environment, interacting with testers and
document writers etc. remotely.

It all neatly fits into e-mail for collaboration and different people
at different places.

Also skype video calls and desktop sharing play into this model.

Li-f-e MATE edition came about to support schools in Gujarat, India.
They needed a synfig studio: a very simple-to-use C and Java IDE,
apart from standard fare of complete office suite and other
applications. Gujarat now starts teaching OpenOffice (LibreOffice) in
the 9th grade, and the Linux operating system all the way to shell
scripting in 10th, and Java, C, HTML, JavaScript in the 11th and 12th
grades. This Li-f-e edition tries to get everything they need in an
integrated bundle which they can use on a stand-alone PC."

So, after a wide search, finally I'm about to buy a tablet (Apple iPad 16GB
Retina Display) but I have few doubts. So, please share if anyone is using
the same tablet (mentioned above).

*Doubt 1:* Can I share/send songs, files et. all to other devices via
bluetooth from Apple iPad? (Rumor: Apple connects only to apple devices via
bluetooth)

*Doubt 2:* Can I connect external HDD on my Linux system (Ubuntu and Linux
Mint) via USB? (Rumor: Requires iTunes for connecting external devices)

*Doubt 3:* Is there only one single way to download Apps for iPad from
AppStore?
What is the ratio of paid vs free apps? (Sorry for this silly question. Not
used Apple AppStore so having doubts.)

*Doubt 4:* Apple iPad only supports mp4 video format. What about other
formats? What are the other possible ways to play other video formats like
flv, avi et. all.

*Doubt 5: *Can I use earphones from any other company on this iPad because
it doesn't comes with earphones?

So, as of now these are my doubts. Please share your experiences.

At the end, Apple doesn't need any review but as a normal customer I want
to know the answers for my doubts.

*Note:* There is no Apple store or any such other shop at my town so asking
here. Don't know whether its appropriate place to ask such doubts or not.
Please spare me if not.

Looking forward.

Thank you.

Your choice looks bad for your use case, could have done still more
research I feel.

It only connects with Apple products.

GtkPod may help I guess. But it may / may not work. I don't know much
about that.

Don't care about shelling out money to Apple as you already are
spending a lot of money unnecessarily (based on use of the device to
cost ratio).
Personally I don't have any idea for the question.

Don't know. Even if it supports iPad's battery may drain extremely
fast when non-mp4 format video is played.

No idea.

Hope this helps,

Frankly, such questions belong to an Apple Inc forum.  Try FB and pose
questions there.

Yes, I realized this only when I compare iPad with other Google Nexus on
mentioned doubts (in previous thread). Anyways, I did some more research
and found Google Nexus 7 C perfect for my needs and also satisfies me on
the asked doubts. As well on price also.
Any words on Google Nexus tablet?

I own a Google Nexus 7 2013 edition. Overall it is very good. It is
fast, smooth, has extremely high resolution display. Only the speaker
sound is spectacular but okay.

Never tried that. But there are many torrent apps in google play -
including utorrent, bittorrent.

By default Nexus supports good number of video formats. There are
better players in Google Play like MX Player which support almost all
format.
Do see that video that is decoded in software will drain your battery
extremely fast. Don't use them unless it is absolutely necessary.

I hope you read the error message, it is telling  you exactly which
method is supported i.e."Only Bearer Scheme ..."   Did you change the
method after reading the error message **or** you still using some
other method.    I don't know much about OAuth but it appears there is
a mismatch between the client and the server.

You have two options
(a) fix the client to use the Bearer scheme or
(b) configure the server to support whatever scheme the client is using.

IMO, it boils down to what is your requirement?

> *Any help is greatlly appreciated*

In order to get help, you must describe the scenario of your test
case.    What are the tools, their version no., the OS platform on
which this test case is executed.

what is the name of the web service you are trying to connect? is it
public web service (like google-drive-api or wordpress-rest-api etc) or
private?

is your client already authorized? If you know your client's access-key,
you can try accessing that web-service using curl like below,

$ curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access-key>'
https://<host>/path/to/service

Hi,

My ISP is Youbroadband and am having some weird problems with their
connection.

My internet connection is 12 mbps and am getting full speed 12 mbps down
and 2~4 mbps up consistently during the day up to around 4 PM. Afterwards,
the net is totally unusable. I get 4 mbps down and 0.1 mbps up. I don't
think the guys at the ISP know what's happening and I am on the verge of
changing my ISP.

IMO, all the ISPs are over subscribing the circuits for consumer
broadband offerings.

At present, I have 2 DSL service providers coming over independent
telco lines (MTNL+Tata).  Til a couple of months ago,  I used to
pretty much get the full b/w I was paying for.  Not any more...   I
have had long pointless arguments with engineers right upto NOC level.
  The standard answer "you will get **upto** X Mbps service."   The
keyword is 'upto'; the speed can vary from 256Kbps (TRAI min.) to the
subscribed speed.

The other aspect, the speed is applicable only from your modem/router
to the connection point within the ISPs network.  So you should ask
them for a 'test' server within their network.   MTNL/Tata does
provide such servers.  Beyond that no ISP can give any guarantee.

If the timing is consistent everyday, then it is congestion.  Perhaps
you are in an area where people start accessing the internet around 4
PM.   Request them to put you on a different circuit.

I used to have Iqara (before they changed name to YouBroadband) way
back in 2005 and their service was pathetic especially on weekends.
Moreover, their engineers were unwilling to acknowledge problems on
their side.   It appears that has not changed.

+1  to Shakti's response.

Unless the author is releasing the book for free, you need to pay for
it.   Expecting it 'free' of cost is tantamount to piracy!

**OR** learn by installation, experimentation and then blog your
experience that is open for all to read and use it for their
installation.  That will be **your** contribution to FOSS.

Sathish,

You can install WordPress blog parallel with any website. Just make sure to
keep link to it. WordPress was made for Blog and now good sites are done
using WP. It has many advantages Like SEO factors, comments and etc..

Just check again if you want to reinvent same wheel.



With Thanks and Regards,
Kumar

Hi,

Is it happening for all sh files or only this particular file?
If it is the then check the --color option is enabled in your profile and
the terminal color is same as script files you may feel it is invisible.

Try "ls | wc -l" and check it is displaying correct count with this script
file.

Vinoth Marimuthu
Dear All,

I have a strange problem with a file named "run_dindel.sh" placed  on
gluster file system.
The file does not  show up in "ls" ,e neither does ls filename with tab
completion works. The filename does not start with a dot (.) All other
adjacent files are listed normally with ls command.
But  the can be opened  with vi and I am able to see the contents of the
file.

Could someone let me know whats happening ?

Regards,
Krishna

Prima facie, your web server may not be configured for https (port 443).

Check with:
netstat -nlt | egrep ':443'

Hi,
In my system, netstat -nlt | egrep ':443' does output anything.....

Is it necessary to implement my local as ssl server? So far i downloaded
cert certificate, should'nt i do it instead create self sined cer in my
local itself?? Also plz educate me if i need to set my host as SSL server
or simpley self sign certificate is enough??

This  HTTPI::SSL error occurs in my local implementation of SOAP webservice
(SSL enabled)? Plz give ur views to fix this.

Giving all details about the date,time, agenda in the initial mail itself
is essential to avoid these kind of followup questions.

Please provide all the details in the forthcoming mails.

Sorry for short notes.
It is web design and development usage.

- Editor to code.
- Tools to slice images.
- File to upload in server.

1. Web Design & Development
 PHP, MySQL,JavaScript, Open source CMS ( WordPress, Joomla ) and Framework
like Cake, Larave etc ..
2. Mobile Apps and responsive design
Andriod, HTML5 , CSS3. Jquery etc.





With Thanks and Regards,
Kumar

Try out FreeNAS/Openfiler/OpemediaVault and learn by yourself. That would
