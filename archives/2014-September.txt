Talk: How We Scaled Front End Development - Practical Lessons on Scaling JS Apps

Praveen Selvam

The practical question every front end developer has to answer is how
well a library weaves into the JS stack used by the existing apps. The
past year saw an extensive growth in the space of what we call ?Front
End Ops?, where tools such as Gulp, Bower, Yeoman, etc. have been key
in moving a lot of automated work into JS, that previously used to be
solved using Ruby, Python, or similar scripting solutions. In this
talk, I will use our startup story as a backbone to elicit the various
techniques, principles and strategies we used to conceptualize, build,
and ship our JS apps. Of course, the challenges are included as well!

12:00 PM - 12:45 PM

Talk: Building a lightweight mobile website using nodejs

Arvind Sridharan

This session will help developers apply practices that we have used at
stayzilla.com to make our website lightweight. It will also give an
overview of how we have used node js to build a production ready web
application. The motivation behind building our mobile website on
nodejs was to make it lightweight and also to easily integrate with
our php codebase by consuming json data. Also building a seperate
mobile website gave us the option to create a mobile first design and
therefore make the user experience better.

12:45 PM - 1:30 PM Lunch hosted by Indix
01:30 PM - 03:30 PM

Workshop: Building single page apps with React.JS

Vagmi Mudumbai

ReactJS helps us build Reactive UIs with javascript. It was built by
Facebook and is used by open source editors like Atom. ReactJS builds
a Virtual DOM instead of using Browser?s DOM that allows Single Page
Apps to run at 50fps even on mobile browsers. This also simplifies the
View code as there is no need to track the state of the DOM and can
simply re-render the view without affecting the performance.

The workshop will be structured into three parts. The first and third
part will talk about the state of React and its path going forward and
the meat of the workshop would be a hands on approach in building a
Todo List app using a parse backend and the UI built with React.JS and
Backbone.
A quick intro to React.JS and JSX
Build a todolist app with React.JS and Backbone
A quick intro to Flux and upcoming projects like React Router similar
projects like HTMLBars

Subject: [Inpycon] Python Month 2014
To: Mailing list for the PyCon India conference <inpycon at python.org>


Hi,

Last year we celebrated the month before PyCon India as Python Month.
We had volunteers who went around the country and organized workshops
at more than 40 colleges! Organizations like CampusHash also helped us
out in promoting Python Month and PyCon India through their workshops.
This year we plan to organize the same. The month before PyCon India
is chosen because that gives us an opportunity to promote PyCon India.
Also, we'd like to keep organizing these workshops even after PyCon
this year. So start planning.

This is a really big task to handle and we need volunteers from all
the states and cities. If you're reading this, here is how you can
help -

1. If you're a student or a profession, propose a workshop at your
institute. Talk to the authorities, fix a time and we'll help you find
a speaker
2. If you're a Python developer and can speak about the basics of
Python, let us know. We'll find you a college around you that has
asked for a speaker. If you don't want to speak, still let us know. We
can find workshops that you can help organize.

Remember that this is a complete voluntary effort and there is no
payment involved in any stage of these workshops. The Institutes
should communicate with the speaker directly once they are connected
and take care of anything they need, like transportation etc.

Interested? Please sign in here and we'll get back to you -
http://bit.ly/pythonmonth2014

We need a Lot of volunteers to manage these workshops, talk to
colleges, talk to the speakers and schedule the workshops. Ideally
we'd like to have couple of volunteers per city who can look after
Python Month workshops in that city. These volunteers will go through
the workshop requests in that city and find speakers and connect them.
If you're interested in this role, please reply to this mail.

If you have any suggestions or comments, please let us know.

Thanks,
Bibhas

Dear Knights;
1.  Subsequent to my mail appended below, I removed/ purged LXDE. Ran xterm
as root, no problem. Copied the xorg conf.new from root to /etc/X11/Xorg
tried with the fresh configuration as user, no luck. Used the 'diff'
command to compare the Xorg configuration with that of the root account and
the user, same problem listed earlier.
2. Checked  the space in the root folder 7% utilised only, that's not the
problem either. Changed the permissions /temp as well. On thing I noticed
the .Xauthority, .Xsessions files created in the user accounts were -r--
--- --- . Changed the permissions for that as well not much help. No
.Xinitrc file.
3. Xterm starts up as sudo in the user account, though. Alternatively will
reinstall X, but then purging X is tedious. By the by the Processor is a
PIII on a zebronic board, have two Seagate hard disks one currently
mounted. Any thoughts please,

Dear Knights;
I am in the process of installing Debian with LXDE, the root account boots

Hopefully, your /home is on a separate partition.  Nevertheless, back

Having seen many job posts on this list, I think this blog (
http://labs.ft.com/2014/08/not-everything-is-awesome/ ) hits the bulls
eye. Sample this:

"As much as it?s irritating to see these ?performance superlatives?
used in job ads, it?s also just plain hilarious to imagine what it
would be like to literally hire one.

Rockstar: Music would be too loud. And think of the tantrums. Would
refer all pull request comments to their agent.
Guru: Code would probably be indecipherable. Solutions would work but
no-one would understand how. For no apparent reason documentation
would only make sense when incanted.
Ninja: Would you even know if you had hired a ninja? At least they
probably wouldn?t use much desk space.
Superstar: The entourage would get in the way, and red carpet is hard to clean."

Message-ID: <CAC4BoN5tvBD5-+qdFRSyrhRkSaE0Vd=k2ebhHGM=PdZ9hkb7zA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We have a few web developer positions open for BookConnect's (
bookconnectsolutions.com ) Chennai office. Those hired will have an
opportunity to work on a set of  high traffic web applications/mobile apps.
Since we are a small group of developers, there will be an opportunity to
learn the full cycle of development of large web applications and to
acquire a good knowledge of the book industry domain. The applications we
develop are related to standards based data exchange between various book
industry players.

The skills required are :

1. Good understanding of web application development
2. HTML/Java Script/CSS and Java Script Frameworks
3. At least one web programming language/framework

While the work will be primarily on Python/Django/XML/Non Relational
Databases etc., we are willing to train developers from other platforms
provided they demonstrate a good understanding of web development process
and expertise in at least one language/framework used for web development.

Experience:

More than one year of experience preferred.

We will be open to taking those with less experience if we see a good
promise in the candidate.

Please mail me your resume off-list to discuss further.

Thanks and Regards,
Murthy Raju

Message-ID: <CAHhM8gC5GG5Qn9-pevoZUjiOgmfcWCON=1axdr8npXXTJd1Oqw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I am experiencing a major problem at a client site.   For proof of
concept (PoC), I setup a Samba4 AD (Zentyal 3.2) and I was able to
demo all client systems joining it  use it for user auth, file system
uid:gid map etc. successfully.

The PoC was on a 192.168.3.0/24 network.

I changed the IP number to bring it into 192.168.1.0/24 network for
migration to production.

Windows + Linux clients are able to join.

MAC clients are able to join the AD, but user UID:GID maps is all mangled up

I have searched high and low but been able to find a solution.    I am
wondering if the change in IP number has any bearing on the problem.

Thanks for your help.

OK, this link answers my original question
https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Change_IP_address_of_the_DC

i.e. Yes, the IP of a DC can be changed.  The changed IP number is not
causing the problem.  I tried a fresh Zentyal install and the problem
persists.

FWIW, here is the 'id' dump for an user called  "redhat.linux" on the

Could you please explain more about this paragraph? If I understand
correctly, you will be training candidates and the cost of the training
should be payed by candidates. Then you will send them to companies.
Getting the job is not in your hand.

This looks like you are a training institute. Why the hell this mail is
for job? what guarantee you give for your candidate?

I'm sorry, but If my understanding is correct, then F**K YOU for playing
with fresher's mind.

Hello all,

Sending this on behalf of Shreyas.

*tl;dr*- Mozilla is organizing a Makerparty in Chennai on *13th and 14th of
September*. Would appreciate your support and involvement in the event.
Visit the Site for more info : http://makerpartychennai.in/

*About Mozilla Maker Party:*
Maker Party 2014 was kick-started by President Obama at White House Maker
Faire
<https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/06/18/president-obama-announces-mozillas-maker-party-2014-at-first-ever-white-house-maker-faire/>
this
June. From June 15 - Sept 15, Mozilla Foundation is hosting a Global Maker
Party (https://webmaker.org/en-US/party/), with small to large Webmaking
events happening everywhere. Mozilla India will be hosting/ be part of the
flagship Maker Party World Tour.

*About 'Maker  Party: Chennai 2014'* (September 13-14th)
'Maker Party: Chennai 2014' is an attempt to map and empower a community of
educators and creative people who share a passion to innovate, evolve and
change the learning landscape. This will be the first of its kind Mozilla
Foundation event in Tamil Nadu.

The event has a simple format like science fair, where facilitators are
sharing cutting edge technologies, teach something new in a engaging way.
This event is a platform to connect diverse organizations with learners and
encourage connected learning.

We are asking organizations to host a learning station, i.e.  a simple
table-top activity,  based on their programs/ background, by planning
hands-on activity that is easily understandable by any age group/ skill
level.

The audience age group would be *13+ and above*, the attempt to target
tweens, teens and adults is, we think it is the right time to tap their
interest and get the 'Maker' thinking right from the young age than being a
'consumer'. i.e. Encourage the youth to change from 'technology/web
consumers' to 'technology/web makers'.

Here you can learn more about the previous Mozilla Maker Party Events:

So the basic idea is to set up learning stations in collaboration with
various organizations. At present we are in touch with various open source
communities within Chennai including the Google Developer Group and
Wikimedia.
Taking in suggestions from the community members, we've decided to keep it
to Open Source alone.
I would like to request you all to help us organize this in a good way as
this is the first of its kind event in Chennai. We're also inviting
speakers for parallel sessions on topics related to Open source software's
and even Station mentors to teach something innovative and different at the
stations. Please mail me off the list if you have any
suggestions/ideas/feedback/questions on this.

Do students have to pay to join your company ? Or do you mean that
students will be put in bench in your company
and then they have attend client side interviews?

Change the boot order in BIOS to boot from pen drive. Alternately,
most BIOS have a hot key (e.g. F10 in my laptop) to list boot device.
You can select to boot from pen drive.

That's great. I have been coding Ubuntu touch just for fun, for a long
time. But most people will stick to android, just like most people stick to
Windows and Mac. But this platform is great. One of the best.

Do we need to pay the amount while entering the venue ?

Hi ilugc,

I am planning a trip down to Chennai to talk to people about hamara
linux and
the hamara project generally.

Hamara Linux is a new distribution tailored to the Indian market from
the perspective of language, design, usability and access.

We are promoting design that users feel accustomed to, a way to reach a
larger audience and also stem cultural hegemony. We target intel as well
as ARM, to make access to the platform easier/cheaper. Native language
support - you will be able to find us using a search engine without
knowing how to read English.

I will be in Chennai on Monday 22nd September and would really welcome
the opportunity to meet with like minded open source / linux enthusiasts.



Regards


Vikas Tara

That's great, but won't it be another fragmentation? For example Boss linux
is practically used no where in India. It was funded by the Indian
government, but did not get traction. But ofcourse gobverment is highly
beuracratic and no real technicial would like to work under it.

Why not develop packages for popular distros that will add our languages in
user friendly manner, or urge people to participate in translation
projects? Or tell people to improve linuxes power efficiency as India is
really deficit in electricity.

The best think would be a distro that lets us configure what ever we want,
I think http://www.gnewsense.org/ did it, but I don't know its status now.

But any way as the OS is getting stabilized, the only battle that's being
fought in linux-for-normal-people world is the UI battle and Ubuntu is
winning it all the time. If one says android, I would like to install
Ubuntu touch on their tablet/phone. But I feel this will be a great student
project to learn this OS. Your college will be proud of you.

This is why we want to come and talk to people.

If the existing distros do not cover the needs of ordinary people, then
this is not fragmentation.

For example, if your not literate in english, you have very little hope
of ever finding linux and to a certain
extent, you might be scared off from using a computer altogether.

Also, another example, we are working furiosly towards an arm build
running to run on the cubie board which brings low cost, low power
hardware with the possibility of running 100% solar - and all
technologies that can be accessed by the man on the street.

We looked very closely and gnewsense and trisquel, both very valuable
projects, they helped us to craft a good base for building the distro - and
I think if you ask them - that's what they intended.

I hope you checked out the screenshots at www.hamaralinux.org for an
example of UI.

btw - I am bit old for college, I graduated in 1994, my first linux was
redhat 6.2 ;)

Yeah, hopefully. A business model around support, hosting, cloud 
provision - where fellow linux geeks can get paid
to do what they like doing.

Thanks, I hope so too!

Dear *Founder - Hamara Linux*

Welcome.

Having something is better than nothing.
Started a good job.

-------------------------------
I have few things I'd like to get clarified from Founder.

1) first what is hamara?
2) when you say 'stem cultural hegemony' - what do you mean?

If you want to make the technology to reach one who dont know english
what will replace english.

*cultural hegemony - described as the  domination of a culturally diverse
society by the ruling class who manipulate the culture of that society.*


*Do you think cultural hegemony will give you some solution for
all culturally diverse people?*
what will happen to the rest of the diverse culture?
what is the ruling class culture here?

-------------------------------
you said
- "hamara" Linux is the name.
- developed in perspective of language.
- to create stem cultural hegemony
- without english.

what cultural hegemony you are about to bring in?
what should we assume from the name?

*when you think of  *"new distribution tailored to the Indian market from the
perspective of language" *what came in you mind* is '*HAMARA*'.
when you "put ????? [Beta]
<http://www.hamaralinux.org/hamara?p_p_id=82&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_82_struts_action=%2Flanguage%2Fview&_82_redirect=%2Fhamara&_82_languageId=hi_IN>
and
leave others".
when you said "without english" (*not with your native language *).

*how it will become linux focusing indian market and language perspective*?
perhaps you are right  since you didn't mention in which way the
perspective will be.

I'm wondering what 'stem cultural hegemony' you are providing by 'hamara'?

*Do you think representing a diverse society only by majority is healthy
way? *

May be its Ye Hai Hamara!  <http://www.hamaralinux.org/about-us>for you!

-------------------------------
Me:

*Am sorry if the person behind Founder *feels it odd/discouraging .

*But I have convey how it feels when you are represented by something you
are not.*

I took cultural hegemony literally to explain.

I'm not sure you are funded to manage all language perspective - if not why
you pretending.

I'll be accepting you gladly if you can answer these without 'cultural
hegemony'.

At least you made a move to have something.
All the best for that as long us it meets us as us.

*Am not against anything. I'm only defending what I have.*

Don't take it as discouraging  but

Thank you.

+1 , we Tamils should make our own Namma Linux, rather than support a
distro that benefits just people speaking Hindi. And northerners should
leave their thought that entire India will accept Hindi as national
language and rat as national animal as they are more in number.

I should have said it before as I had the same thought, but did not just
not to start a flame.

Thanks for the reply, I guess my choice of words may not have been best, 
I'm sorry if that's the case.

When I said "stem cultural hegemony", I mean to prevent or limit it.

So, of course hamara should be "namma" in TN, or "saada" in Punjab.

We only have one tamil speaker in our team at the moment, so I am 
traveling to meet people there.

If we are to reach a wide audience, then there is little point replacing 
one language with another. English and western
culture is arguably dominant, probably followed by Hindi / Northern 
Indian culture - within the project we have the ability
to be much more ethnically diverse but still in the spirit of being 
together.

I hope you will come and meet with us on the 24th, I am just waiting for 
confirmation of the venue.

Do it! raise a bug for anything that you find missing:
http://bugs.hamaralinux.org/

If you want to change the name, raise an issue for that too.

Your mistaking me for someone who knows hindi!

Hello all,

Good to see an interesting debate - Always healthy.

I am part of this initiative and I am very much from our Singara Chennai.

Having read through some of the posts, I think there are some valuable 
inputs. Sometimes its easy for us to digress a debate
into something that we are passionate about. My aim is to see how can we 
make a difference to the common man? How
can we ensure that education and technology can be made available to 
kids who cannot afford it?  This
inevitably means we will need local support from every state and we will 
solid feedback and comments on how we can
make this a national venture.

I think a meeting would be good. Sometimes emails can be misinterpreted 
and a healthy face to face discussion can only lead
to a positive result - or atleast we should aim for one :-)

Thanks
Deepak Chandrababu

Hi,

Top posting is as bad as spitting in the road.
For the sake of mailing list etiquette please  consider not to top post.

Replying to a mailing list mail by removing all the context is also as
bad a mailing list etiquette as top posting as it doesn't provide any
information to the reader what and whom you are replying. People like
Kenneth even used to call it as top posting. So please avoid this.

Thanks & Regards,

Yes - we do that too.

I have personally been contributing to open source projects since 1998.

I don't think you can really call distro building "copy and paste"

The core of the initial mail writer's argument was a space for him to talk
with people .Sadly ,  no one was even ready to discuss on it .
Lets not pounce on some one who comes with a budding idea and tear it
apart  . At the best , arrange a place for meeting . Allow him to address
people and give out his views . If anybody has issues , please raise it
there . Generally , there are 2 kinds of issues - People with hidden agenda
and people who make genuine mistakes . Lets not confuse one for the other .

P.S : I have never met Vikas Tara nor do I have any relation with Hamara
Linux .

Thanks for the words, am really keen to just meet and discuss the
project more than anything else.

It's a new initiative, there really is no set agenda yet, I think some
really valuable suggestions have already come out
of this thread and passionate people can draw it in directions that they
see fit.

So, I'm still hoping some of you guys will come and meet up and my
flight to chennai won't be wasted :)

I really miss KG and feel like thinking on how he would react to the
"yet another distro" talk !

Anyways I personally think lets have another kid on the block who
might actually involve community instead of going on their own basing
on some main distro like our famous public funded distribution has
done.

The entire spirit of Free software was to encourage as many outcomes
as possible. Community always went on  "If I dont like it I will fork
it " and if it got some traction it also served as a good example. We
have LibreOffice.

Coming to the main point of having a distro , though I welcomed you I
am only afraid about the efforts you are going to put up. please do
read up on many distro stories and how they couldn't survive .
Changelogs of different releases and their base system. Also the
relation between upstream distributions brings hell lot of stories to
learn.

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ubuntu/ForDebianDevelopers?action=show&redirect=UbuntuForDebianDevelopers
could help as an example.
Also have a look at Dedbian Pureblend  https://wiki.debian.org/DebianPureBlends

Try to achieve close to pure blend you can be assured of the quality
and huge support from Debian.

Pavithran

Currently we have taken a similar route to trisquel / gnewsense.

Whilst depending on ubuntu source code for many packages, and compiling
some from source,
it does give us the advantage of moving across from ubuntu upstream slowly.

I did do some work in Libre around that time

True, I am concerned about that too.

But having watched distros come and go since the late 1990's and still
not touch the mainstream
populations of most countries, there is certainly room for more.

Good point.

The current release is based on Ubuntu upstream, but it's likely that a
developer community might take it more toward debian.

Thanks for the input - if your around in Chennai, I hope you will come
meet us.

The Name "Hamara" is derived from Hindi... Right???

Can I assume that this is another form of Hindi Imposition over entire
India?

I donot see any other language than Hindi on your screens..

Do you mean that Hindi is the only language being used in India?

When you do not show up any other language in your website, how can I
assume that it is tailored for my language?

And the cultural hegemony means use of Hindi everywhere instead of

 Can people who know only Tulu be able to usethe search engine?
Or do they NEED to KNOW Hindi or other language?

Indians have many native languages ....... Hindi is just one among them!!

Please stop all means of Hindi Imposition.

I welcome distirbutions that support our own native language not that one
which assumes some alien language as my native one as well as recommends me
to use that!!

Dear Arun,

Kovam Vendham :-)

Saadhi irundozhiya verillai: Ittar Periyor, Idathaar Izhigulathor [ 
Avvaiyar ] .

The aim is not to create a divide amongst the few individuals who want 
to make a change. The aim is to share.

You are 100% correct - Hindi is just one language and we do need to make 
it available to a wider
section of the society and that can only happen with all our support. 
Our country has over 700 languages and
we have to start somewhere right. I am hoping to get my retired father 
to help in Tamil translation, although,
I am worried about his technical grasp - He has learnt to email my 
mother sitting right next to him though :-)

I will post back a meeting time and location. Date is confirmed on the 
22nd of September in Chennai.

Please do come along. What's the worst that can happen. Either we will 
all agree or we will disagree. Atleast we
can all shake hands in the belief that we had a healthy debate for a 
greater good.

Take care my friend

Deepak

That's exactly what we are saying. Stop pushing the Hindi linguistic ideas
on us. That too using a server in the heart of our capital and to say that
we must contribute to a distro that's named after a language that once and
till now trying to oppress our culture is truly unethical.

If this distro is so pure, why not go to Japanese, French or German LUG's
and tell them to contribute to this distro?

I do not understand why the public funded BOSS distribution, or Linux
distro used in Kerala IT mission cannot be scaled and contributed by the
Indian FOSS community ?

Guess, people like to develop for greater good (read Debian, Ubuntu and so
on).

I also happen to know a very active FOSS user who uses heavily localised
Debian (in Malayalam) , you can catch him in FSUG Calicut mailing list.

Back to the point of  discussion. What is the point of Hamara Linux ?
I fail to see the perceived mission, objective of the above mentioned in
its site.

No, read my previous post. We are currently working on translations.

Personally, I do not read or write hindi, but I don't have a like or

Time is the issue, and we only have one tamil speaker in the team, hence 
we are trying to meet with people.

Would you raise a bug and supply a translation for the website.

Once it's translated into tulu, it will be indexed and so someone 
speaking that language will be able to use it.

That's sort of the point.

Sorry, I cannot have been clear enough in my post.  You can raise a bug 
for changing the name to your own language.

You can do the same for a translation.

Interestingly, my German and Spanish colleagues think this is a really 
good initiative.

More info is coming to the website shortly, but we though meeting some 
of you guys in Chennai was a more human approach..

No endeavour can be futile!

Ignore the bile and go for it, Hamara Team :-)

And those fearing cultural domination: just don't use Hamara Linux. If
you feel the power of its culture will sway weak minded masses, start
your own distro and fight it with the power of your own culture. If
someone is forcing people to use Hamara Linux, pls report to the
police.

Just too much hot air in here. Hope its all vented now :-)

Cheers,
mano

Guys, All the best.
I am sure you guys are pretty smart and capable by looking at the way you
handled this heated thread :)

Don't know why this thread was hijacked into a Hindi imposition argument! I
did not get any of those vibes from visiting the site...

>From a suggestion view point, I have a request.
For the first time, I have to think about parental controls as my 8 year
old daughter has started to use the home computer regularly. I am really
worried about inadvertent exposure to unwanted content.  A 'built in', by
default 'on' parental control with opt in for adult content would be great
as a fundamental part of the desktop. Certainly a feature any Indian
talking any language would be appreciative of!

BTW on a lighter note, I do not understand Hindi and was a victim of
mindless Hindi imposition as a 3rd language (English and Tamil being the
1st and 2nd) in school. Believe it or not, I can read and write Hindi but
cannot understand or talk any of it!

I am in a similar position. I have two children who are using computers
at home, so I implemented http://www.squidguard.org/
on my home network.

Would you mind raising an issue for this feature on our bug tracker? I
would be happy to spend some time packaging it for hamara.

I really understand. I grew up with Punjabi at home and English, Latin,
French and German imposed by the school!

Or use our base and help us to make it yours too?

Isn't this what Linus intended when he released his first kernel? "Here
you go, do what you want with it"

It's exactly what Mark Shuttleworth did when he searched the Debian
mailing lists
to form the Ubuntu core team. Whatever you feel about that approach,
they did make debian's core easier for the average person
to use and they got us all thinking about user experience.

Thanks Mano for you positive perspective.

I am not sure I understand. Would it be possible for you to provide
more detail? For example, the operating system/platform, version of
Kile, detail of the Tamil font and installation method, how did you
enable input in Tamil?

creating awareness on what to do and what not to for mothers.

Please let me know if someone can help me develop a prototype for the same.

Message-ID: <CAJR+9kbhiidoG=5gzAwfERi_OzVE6W0wqnomQ-yuPO_9fqaWyQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello People,

I am a coder primarily using a technology called Ruby on Rails. Its THE
MOST marvellous way to create web apps. But I see its adoption is very low
in India. The reason is because it has great abstract ideas like Unix does
(as compared to other OS), its hard to understand its abstractness and
simplicity. So there aren't many people. Even people who claim knowledge of
it are extremely crappy.

Many small companies are afraid to take upon Rails because of the fear of
lack of resources. Many students don't know how valuable they are if they
master this skill. If we can build a bridge it will be enormous boost to
the industry.

I would love to conduct Rails training, but don't have the infrastructure.
If any one is interested  in investing and / or providing infrastructure
and would like to know its enormous commercial potential please contact me.

You can use FFMPEG to combine the audio file and the video file into a new
video file.
If you can provide the formats and codecs of the 2 files, i will try and
give the command.

Hi Satya,

We are trying to organise a meeting at 6 pm on the 22nd of September.

I will finalise the location in a day or two. Perhaps you should come 
and join us.

It will an interesting conversation and our aim is to try and build a 
platform for a
potential social cause as well. So may well align with your aspirations.

Aside to this, I am happy to provide some personal direction towards 
your venture
from the professional experience that I have gained.

Thanks

Deepak

It is interesting, indeed. However, without additional context it
would be difficult to appreciate the topical relevance.

Developing this type of system in private, without the populations eyes
on the code is contrary
to most open source enthusiasts core values. Sorry for omitting this
statement, I sort
of imagined it was obvious.

I must stop making assumptions :)

Please read and understand what the OP meant before responding! He just
said if you want to build and host a website for you lug, they'll provide
the hosting and sub domain free. Nowhere does he mention that he'll lead
the effort to develop a website for your lug.

Sorry for hijacking the topic,I beg  to differ with this view.
Already ilugc activities  are frozen because of lack of PHYSICAL
volunteers  and  we need people to stand united as one entity for the cause.

I am regular BSc passed out candidate and working as a software engineer
for last 10 years. Below is the eligibility criteria for enrolling into PhD
program in Computer Science for IIT Chenni / Madras:

http://www.iitm.ac.in/research/doku.php?id=research:eligibility

Computer Science

Master's degree in Engineering/Technology. Preference will be given to
Engineering those with M.Tech/M.S degree in Computer Science & Engineering.

Please let me know preferably via distance education program, I can do,
such that I can enroll into PhD in Computers program at IIT after a year or
two. The site says Master's degree - does it means to do MSc or MCA -
please guide appropriately. If MCA degree can also be considered then I
believe that due to my experience factor I can make lateral entry too and
save some time.

Hello sir,

AFAIK, to enroll yourself one must have a relevant masters degree in that
field. And, there is no such provision to get lateral entry as up yo my
knowledge in regular masters degree. Correspondence may be a option but you
have to check that.
Hope it helps.

Hi Muthukkumar,

Have you checked that rpcbind service is running or not? Because by default
in CentOS server every service is off for all runlevels. You have to enable
that using "chkconfig <service> on" then start that service manually.

After that see that your problem goes away or not?

Please follow the mailing list guidelines and do not bottom post. It is
almost as bad as top posting because to read your reply, people have to
scroll down the entire content of the mail you're replying to and there
is little to no context regarding which part you are replying. The
recommended style is interleaved, trimmed posting style where you type
your reply exactly below the part you want to reply to and then trim off
irrelevant text.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Hi,

The software freedom day celebration at trichy has been a grand success.
This event is steered by The members of Free Software Foundation-
Villupuram, hats off to the  team.

The  20 dynamic students of Jamal Mohammad College trichy joined us as
exhibitors in the endeavor.

We started the event with a preparatory workshop on 16th Sept 2014 with the
topic briefing  and the installation process.

Mr.Alagunambi Welkin of ilugc and Executive member of Free Software
Foundation Tamil nadu played the pivot role in making this event as a grand
success.

The Expo happened on Sept 17th 2014.Over 300 students participated in the
event, and that was a huge count of people considering  the on going
Examinations .

Eight popular distros where given to Mr.Jeyapaul and he said that he will
keep it and people can come with a DVD which he will copy and give the same
to the person.

Event covered in "The Hindu" trichirappalli edition read:

commonsense at foundnowhere.com! Just kidding :) People are not going to
respond if you make it difficult for them to read your emails in the
first place. I know that is neither good nor correct example, but I hope
you get the idea. Let me stop here.

Eric Raymond write this nice guide on
How To Ask Questions The Smart Way

Our guidelines are based on this guide and
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Mailing_list_guidelines

Search for his address and send him some gifts.

http://googleitfor.me/?q=mailing+list+guidelines

click the above link for other mailing lists who have guidelines/

Can you confirm that ilugc is the only mailing list that is strict on
guidelines?
Prove it. :-)

Guidelines just like rails framework.
Rails gives all freedom to build any web application. but you have to
follow its rules.

Come on. Learn the guidelines. They are very simple to follow.

You seem to be very much experienced and senior to me. I am a novice so
can't guide you much but let me shed some light (because I was in closely
touch with education sector).

Do you really think that you need a specific degree to research on a
specific topic? If yes, then it's a time to ponder upon and needs a second
thought.

These days we have MOOC and Coursera where anyone can enroll and learn
free-of-cost from reputed universities. We just need a good internet
connection and a computer then anyone can accomplish a lot these days.
(Undoubtedly common sense is mandatory.)

There are massive and countless open source projects running out. Just pick
anyone (which excites you) and then you're good to go.

To be specific, I don't have any trust in these useless degrees like MCA,
M.Sc. (even I never specified or tell anyone that I've done masters)
because I am self-learner. A big thanks to Google and Wikipedia. :-)

I respect self-learners instead of these degree holders (which don't know
much in most of the cases.)

Hope it clears all. Do not hesitate to ask if there is any doubt.

Thank you.

What we tell you may not apply because it is up to the admissions body
to consider your candidature (your past degrees, professional
experience, scores in the entrance exam).

In your place, I would try to meet with the Comp. Science faculty @
IITM.   Setup an appointment with the HoD or a senior Prof. and
discuss (frankly) who you are, what you know and what you want to do.
Emphasize on what skills you bring to the table and why you think you
will be a successful PhD candidate in Comp. Science.  Be ready for
grilling.   Let them guide you vis-a-vis what you need to do to
qualify for the PhD program.

Other alternative would be to apply educational institutions in US.
The universities there are a lot more open to people with diverse
background.   Most PhD inductions come with a stipend that can see you
through your basic needs.

Wish you best in your endeavors.

Unfortunately it does not works that way anyway .. Not sure if you
understood my question, I don't require degree but research institutes
does. Even companies do .. BTW I have self learned to write Linux Device
Drivers / GCC Hooks and many more ...

It also neither works out for IITM. Reason - You need to have Masters
degree ...


I found out MSc - Computer Science at Anna University - Distant education
program - Any idea of this degree / university rating and its validity of
certificate for doing higher studies like PhD.

This is not a Tamil mailing list and there are a lot of people on this
list who do not know Tamil. So please avoid send emails in Tamil. If you
still want to do that, please provide translation for it so that all the
members can understand the content of your email.

If you want to converse fully in Tamil, there is a Tamil ILUGC mailing
list if I remember right. Please join that list and do so there.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Pls stop being too pedantic about the guidelines (they are just
guidelines, not rules!) and scare away people from posting to this
list. There is already concern that participation is not high and
asking people to post to another list is counter productive.

In fact, you could've posted the translation yourself - it would've
taken less number of lines than your objection!

If anyone wants to start another pointless discussion on the pros and
cons of using Tamil in this list, pls start another thread and type
away till your fingers ache. As for me, feel free to post in any
language you feel comfortable in!

Cheers,
mano

       What makes you think he knows Tamil. Probably, he doesn't know
how to read tamil well enough, and was not able to understand that
email. And could have sent that email out of that frustration. Since
we know that there are non-tamil people on the list, It is basic
courtesy to send emails in English, or at least a translation of the
contents in the same email.Thanks

That thread was 'Event Report- Software Freedom Day at Trichy Sept 17 2014'.

It was being hijacked into a discussion on 'To use or not to use Tamil'.

You can use this thread to post your views on the issue.

IMO, raising objections to posts because it transgressed some
guideline is itself the very definition of 'Thread hijacking'. So, pls
raise objections in a separate thread! Perhaps also prefix it with
[meta] !!

Currently our upstream is Ubuntu, with some packages being compiled
independently.

It's likely we will keep moving towards a mixture of debian / hamara as
we grow the community.

Your making quite an assumption there. Actually the artwork for hamara
is produced by Sam Sayer of DeType.

DeType is named after his grandfathers legacy as designer of, arguably,
some of the most iconic cars in history:

Hmm, personally I think it just shows togetherness.

We do however work with the people at Ubuntu, particularly around cloud
orchestration.

Again that's a big assumption. You should really come and meet us, I
think you could benefit from the discussion. It seems like we have got off
on the wrong foot?

I have to confess though, I do have a farm in India and also really love
growing my own food along with my wife and kids, but that's in no way
related to the hamara logo.

Security by obscurity can never be a solution to security/privacy
problems. Each of the above software can claim that they do this and
that and how it provides the user security and privacy, but when it is
not FOSS, it is dead on arrival with just the illusion of security and
privacy, since no one will be able to verify their claims.

Since most of the software and apps auto-update, what stops the NSA or
other intelligence agencies to force the company behind the software to
release a version with backdoors so that they can snoop in? When an
agency like NSA does such a thing, they make sure the company at the
receiving end cannot even disclose that they have been forced by NSA to
do something like that.

http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html by RMS is a
good read on this topic of surveilance.


Thanks & Regards,

Hi

>>   What makes you think he knows Tamil. Probably, he doesn't know
how to read tamil well enough, and was not able to understand that
email. And could have sent that email out of that frustration. Since
we know that there are non-tamil people on the list, It is basic
courtesy to send emails in English, or at least a translation of the
contents in the same email.Thanks

Yes, I agree ,but having said so
ilugc was nourished once by the the physical volunteer (aka the foot
soldier),
This population is now seen in the list of  extinct species.
I think we should give some consideration to the physical volunteer and in
case if he is not comfortable in posting  in english
we can request him to do two things
[1]  use the tag [tamil] in the mailing list
[2] write the english translation or he should/can request for english
translation at the end of his post.

I learned from Shri Ponkandasamy that he is a member and a silent reader of
posts of this forum.
Asking him to post his reply to a inactive list appears to me weired.

regards.

We need to do lot and not find fault on each other for small things.
The attendence in the monthly meet is nearly single digit. We have not
celebrated SFD. We have not done any other event/promotion. It is time
we put full stop to petty things and attract physical volunteers. If
we don't soon we will be extinct.

Good point, on first read I assumed Bleep was opensource, but it does
not appear to be so.

A quick search on bleep+opensource shows people asking the same question
or proposing that
they open the code.

If they don't open the code then I would suggest (and hope) their
success might well be limited in the current climate

Only the client is open source and the server side is still run by
WhatsApp using proprietary software. So I wouldn't even touch it with a
lengthy pole. Ymmv.

What is Arduino?
Arduino, an Italian name meaning "strong friend", is a popular
"open-source electronics prototyping platform based around a
micro-controller. It accepts inputs, such as signals from sensors
(light, temperature, moisture, etc.) or data from the Internet or
wireless devices, and sends output signals to devices, such as LED,
motors, speakers, MIDI sequencers, computers, and so on."

In simpler terms: It is a ready-to-use creative platform, designed to
provide interactivity between humans, smartphones, PCs, sensors and
the physical world. It is especially a boon for creative people who
don't have a technical background and want to translate their wildest
techno-ideas to reality in a snap.

What Arduino can do?
Arduino,is made to be hooked up to sensors which feed it physical
information. These can be as simple as pressing a button, or as
complex as using ultrasound to detect distance, or in the above
example, monitoring the current flowing between two nails in soil:
when the soil gets dry, the current drops and the Arduino carries out
instructions: In this case it talks to a Zigbee internet-connected
radio and posts a Twitter message, but you could just as easily have
it talk to a robot which would water the plant for you.

Who can Attend?
The workshop is especially meant for those who are enthusiastic to get
started with creative projects in new technology and people those who
do not have prior experience in electronics, interfacing and all hack
talk. This Workshop help you to have a general understanding of
instructional programming languages, but this shouldn't be a problem
for starts as you will pick it up as we go along. Besides, we are
super-friendly and will assist participants to demystify code.

Content of Workshop
1. Simple electronic Circuits and Arduino
2. Sensors and Arduino
3. Actuators and Arduino
4. Device Communication with Arduino
5. Line, Shapes, Graphics and Processing
6. Events and Processing
7. GUI Window and Processing
8. Images and Processing
9. Serial communication with Processing
10. Arduino+Processing+ Designing a Game.

    We have only limited seats in this workshop.

    The workshop will last 6 hours, over a lunch break.(3 days)

    All software materials will be provided, and it would be great if
you could get your laptop.

IT IS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW ABOUT ARDUINO AND PROCESSING IN
SHORT SPAN OF TIME!!!!

Subject: [Ilugc] The cost of I.T industry
Message-ID: <CAJR+9kaZ_axUQn-FcM9E6ZrODkcbuj6k9vqe8BUP08xe_Z51gg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello People,

On a cigarette pack there is a huge cancer warning, when there is a smoking
or drinking scene in a movie there is a warning message. When you want to
join the military there is no warning of possible death but just talk of
bravery.

Now there is no warning about the I.T industry too! We all are keeping it
hushed up. I am planning a book on the good, bad and the ugly part of I.T
industry, to expose the truth, to expose the glory of wealth as well as
indignity in it.

I want to talk to people to learn about the facts, learn how one is missing
life in pursuit of becoming next Bill Gates, or how one has become the next
Bill Gates and is having a good time.

I have to to a publisher about it and he seems thrilled about the idea
(mostly the Psychological and Health effect the industry has on people). I
want volunteers to tell me their story in software industry (all data will
be kept anonymous), so that my book can give right guidance to people who
read it.

If you want to be part of my project mail me at 77minds at gmail.com or call
9444018524.

Its not enough if we have software, I think we must aim to create a system
in which people who create software taste freedom.

Thanks for reading.

Subject: [Ilugc] Software Freedom Day at Jaya Engineering College
Message-ID: <54219E02.4000209@gmail.com>

Dear All,

We had Software Freedom Day Celebration on 20th of
this month at Jaya Engineering College, Thiruninravur. It was really
a beautiful FOSS events in one place.

The Events were

1. Stall for FOSS Softwares

2. Tech Talks

3. Workshop in FOSS lab

4. Quiz


Stall for FOSS software was very good. Each student tried to communicate the FOSS software and Freedom behind it. Three people from ILUGC presented Tech talk. It was really proud to see the
young minds stepping towards FOSS. It was really a unexpected day.

Hi all,
Saw this in the newspaper today :-

http://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/policy/governments-os-boss-dying-a-slow-death-due-to-lack-of-patronage/43300186

For people uninitiated, BOSS is Debian+some homegrown code. As nobody
(except people from defence and BOSS own people) has access to the
source repository, we have no idea as to how much they take from
Debian or Ubuntu's source repositories and how much of it is being
made by C-DAV people for BOSS.

I have much less knowledge about BOSS so hopefully somebody can shed
more light if they want.

Wow the stalls are back , I still remember the stalls from
CarteBlanche 2007 where I was coordinating with MIT students for some
stalls. How was the trend of student participation for these stalls
these days ?

Really sorry to say this  but the blog really sounds like some
"Fanboyism" towards people. Its one thing to encourage people but the
community is more important than individuals in my opinion which the
blog posts misrepresents .

PS: The members probably deserve all the praise but my point was more
aimed towards crediting the community.

The blog writing is Individual views,He is just Expressing about the
software freedom day celebration held at Jaya Engineering college and
people he met(All are community member's they came to promote free
software to students by giving technical talks).

Community grows by these type of activities such as Software Freedom
day celebrations where new people get introduced to free
software,where existing member's will be guiding them. This is how
community grows.
There is nothing here to mention about "Fanboyism"

Your  point was more aimed towards crediting the community,
Every community member has the same aspects for the growth of
community if you need some more improvements to be done for the
credibility of community please do share your great ideas.

Thanks,
N.Naresh.

Remember Heartbleed? If you believe the hype today, Shellshock is in
that league and with an equally awesome name albeit bereft of a cool
logo (someone in the marketing department of these vulns needs to get
on that). But in all seriousness, it does have the potential to be a
biggie and as I did with Heartbleed, I wanted to put together
something definitive both for me to get to grips with the situation
and for others to dissect the hype from the true underlying risk.

To: tshrinivasan at gmail.com


Good morning. I am currently using the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS operating
System.In my transport having seperate website(php with mysql).I am
using the same site with Chrome browser.This browser only supported
the tamil language fonts.In end of every transaction i will take
printout(Receipt) using the browser based output print .In priter
setttings, i set "Epson LQ-50" as a default printer.Printer default
settings having only 6X4 Rolling paper size only.When i use the 6X4
size, printer get more lengh of paper.In every prining nearly 2.5 feet
size to be wasted.So i want to change the 6X4 paper size instead of
4X6.But the 4X6 Paper size not available in the Printer settings.so We
have to add the new paper size(6X4) in ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Therefore I
request you to change the settings.

Subject: OSMdata: a Wikidata-like editor for OpenStreetMap
To: OSM <talk at openstreetmap.org>


Hi all

The (long) discussion about importing Wikidata tags in OSM has
prompted this idea into my mind:
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSMdata

I have also describe here in the IdeaLab on meta-wiki:
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/OSMdata:_a_Wikidata-like_editor_for_OpenStreetMap

Here's a quick summary:

== What ==
* using a MediaWiki + Wikibase - let's call it OSMdata[*] - install to
host an item about every single object in OSM (following this schema
Nxxx for nodes, Wxxx for ways, Rxxx for relations).
* claims in a OSMdata page about an item map exactly to key, values
pairs for the same object in OSM.
* OSMdata is synchronized and kept up-to-date with the OSM database (read)
* users can login in OSMdata with their OSM account and contribute,
adding new claims this are saved back automatically in the OSM
database (write)

== Rationale ==
* it seems awesome (!)
* the OSM community gains a new editor for OpenStreetMap, an editor which
use a well known interface and which can get all the benefits of
MediaWiki+Wikibase software development
* Wikibase is tested at 60x its current scale
* Wikibase is used in another big project

Let me stress again that I see OSMdata as being an editor, not a
repository for OSM, in fact I image in it to be a specialized editor
to be used for editing tags.
In my view the idea is to provide a well known interface to edit OSM
(both manually and automatically with bots, using the same bot
frameworks already available for editing Wikidata).

I have described this idea in the talk-it malling list (in Italian)
and a (at least conceptual) similarity has been pointed out towards
the textual editor Level0[2].

I would like to know your opinion, and I would also like to set up
some prototype with a small subset of the data. I tried to set up this
myself but, unfortunately, I am blocked on the first obstacle, i.e.:
how can I tell Wikibase to let me create items with names Nxxx, Wxxx
and Rxxx instead of Qxxx? I do not know enough PHP (nor MediaWiki or
Wikibase) to do this myself. Any help in this direction would be much
appreciated.

Ciao,

Cristian

"I speak of Richard Stallman, progenitor of the free software movement and
creator of GNU (as in GNU/Linux, the most widely deployed operating system
in the world, and GNU bash, the tool that has caused so much shellshock
lately). He's a hero to me, and anyone that honestly evaluates the
landscape of computing's history would conclude that there's few whose
contributions may equal his in importance. I place only Ken, Ritchie, and
Turing by his side. It is shameful that anyone need to write an essay
telling people to stop bashing this man who has worked for free to provide
us with some of the greatest software ever written, but I see a number of
people who I normally respect defaming the man. Beyond that, irresponsible
publications such as the Guardian take the chance to talk shit on Stallman
<http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/26/bash-bug-shellshock-richard-stallman>
and spew some anti-free software garbage. Over the past few years hating
Stallman has become somewhat trendy among the Silicon Valley crowd, and
every HN thread involving Stallman spews childish insults about him."

Nice write up - Though I don't give RMS a hero status, his contributions
are invaluable. Irrespective of his contributions code-wise, his
ideas/philosophies etc inspired a whole generation of people and just
bashing him because some software has a bug is ridiculous. Those people
really need to grow up. Thanks

I understand that M.Sc. (CS-FOSS) is accepted as a qualifying degree for
Ph.D. in Anna University.
For the M.Sc. (CS-FOSS) itself, B.Sc. (and any undergraduate science/arts
degree -- with some programming exposure) is the qualifying degree.
[** admission is on for the 6th batch -- which is expected to start in
mid-oct).

As for Ph.D. in other universities : in general, regular post-graduate
degree is accepted -- they may ask the research scholars to get some
additional credits (including one on Research Methodologies), and waivers
may be given based on the research topic and subjects studied in the
degrees obtained by the candidate. For instance, Research methodologies may
not be needed, if the candidate has M.Phil.

In general, the process is reasonably straight forward if the qualifying
degree is obtained from the same university. If you are migrating in from
other university, it may vary from case-to-case.

I am sorry for top posting but my mail box does not allows any other option.

Thanks to all for their valid suggestion / directions and I would be
joining a Masters course shortly by distance education.

Shortly I came to know presence of IEEE - https://www.ieee.org

I understand that they are a non-profitable research organization - but I
am not clear of how the system works there or rather need some
clarification.(as below)-

Suppose I become a member of IEEE so -

a) Can I opt my own research topic or I have to select one that they will
provide?

b) Where will I get help on my research subject?

c)If in case my research works takes more than a year - how will I publish
my own paper?

d) Is a research publication considered valid for further research in our
country?

e) Does Chennai has a group of IEEE members where we can interface or
exchange ideas?

f) Is there any other such body of GOVT of India or private where we can
participate?

prakash

One way to get placed is

1) Self Learning
2) Involving in projects
3) Creating and recording the Blog about each  and every moment in  the
learning process. This is a ever lasting process.
4) Present talks in public forums like ilugc meet, SFD celebration etc.
5) Be confident and appear for interview
6) If you fail, go to the step number 1.

If you have problem(s) in executing this functional set, you can contact me
off-the-list for assistance.

A trick question. For a firewall and QoS combo need, look at Smoothwall,
Untangle, Std Linux with iptables(shorewall add on)+ tc + squid, pfsense
with other adds on in BSD.

Bandwidth management needs a good understanding of qdiscs and classes.

Hi all

As you may know, the Wiki Loves Monuments competition closes tonight,
and over the next couple of weeks we need to decide on the winning
entries.

In the UK, we expect to have around 7000 entries, from which we need
to select the 500 best for formal judging by the jury.

We?re seeking volunteers to help out with the pre-screening process,
which we have to complete within the next two to three weeks.

Can you help us, please?

To help, you?ll need the following:

1. A minimum of few hours free between now and 14th October

2. A good level of ability to distinguish high-quality photography
from lower quality (guidelines will be provided)

3. A fast broadband connection for downloading to your local computer
several hundred high-resolution images (we?ll tell you how to do it)

4. Suitable software (eg Adobe Lightroom or some other photo-review
software) for reviewing the images at full screen size.

You don?t need to be based in the UK to help.

If you can help, please get in touch now!  Either reply directly to
this posting, or send an email to Michael {{at}} maggs . name

Many thanks

Michael
