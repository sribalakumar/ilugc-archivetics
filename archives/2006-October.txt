Dear ILUGC,

Dr.Sriram has started the process of populating an i386 Ubuntu mirror
at:

http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/pub/ubuntu

It may be a day or two before all packages are available, but do try
it out and send feedback to the list.

Thanks.

Kumar

check with bharathi - aparently bots attacked and took over. I  
suggested a switch over to moinmoin and physical cut and paste into  
the new wiki. Even edit in the old wiki is blocked.

Message-ID: <72288b670609302004y7e19fe33t959f43568673509a@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

The following is my comp's configuration:

AMD Athlon 3000+ 64-bit processor,
ASUS A8V MX motherboard
80 GB SATA HDD (Seagate)

I recently dowloaded and burnt 5 CDs of Novell's Suse 10.1. I read some good
reviews about it, so thought I'll give it a try. However, during
installation it failed to detect my hard disks. It said 'No hard disks
present'. I tried the CDs a day before at one of college systems (I don't
know the conf but its some Intel mobo and a (P)ATA HDD) and it worked there.

The next time I tried installing on my comp, I went to a root prompt
(ctrl+alt+f2) and typed: modprobe sata_sil
I got no mesages or anything. Just the prompt. Afterwards, I did ctrl+alt
f7, and still the hdd is not detected. Please help me
It is mentioned in a readme file that the kernel version is 2.6.16.

Thank you!!

By the way, I updated my BIOS so now my Kubuntu 6.06 is working perfectly,
even the USB drives and my net connection.

Try doing a lsmod and then dmesg to see whether the module got loaded,
and what errors were thrown ..

if you open http://nrcfosshelpline.in/web/regpoll/ you can see how  
many have voted. The results, or current 'leading' can only be  
determined by the list admin after scrutiny and counting. We are not  
verifying against the member database before issuing ballot papers -  
hence the constraint. As of now 35 people have voted.

Not a problem, that's easily done.

However, I'm unable to install Nextenta Alpah 5 on my VMPlayer
instance. This rules out the hands-on demo of ZFS. :-(

The furthest I was able to proceed was the first boot after
installation where the OpenSolaris threw a kernel panic.  If
someone has Nexenta successfully running in a VM, can you
please help me?

Nexenta is a OpenSolaris distro that uses the OpenSolaris kernel
and Ubuntu Dapper userland.  See http://www.nexenta.com/index.php.

What about SchilliX ? http://schillix.berlios.de/
Tried that one ?

Jorg Schilling is a loud-mouth when it comes to cribbing about Linux,
is his distro any good ?

Nope!  I prefer the comfort of apt :-)

Installing open source packages on Solaris is painful. The
Solaris install media itself includes some basic open source
packages, and sunfreeware.com also helps.  But there's nothing
on Solaris that comes even remotely close apt or BSD ports.
sunfreeware is improving, but IMO it's not yet useable.

OpenSolaris kernel with a familiar GNU/Debian userland will be
a truly unbeatable combination.

OpenSolaris is also picking up a good deal of momentum...  rumours
are that Google is evaluating OpenSolaris in their data centers!!

pkgsrc at times feels superior to FBSD's ports. People comfortable
with apt will find it comfortable to work with. Seems to be available
on Solaris.

There is talk of Debian supporting OpenSolaris so don't loose heart.

Yes.. OpenSolaris on Opteron servers. Sounds like a good combination.

yes, ftp.iitm.ac.in presents different views to users on campus and off. only
the pub tree of on-campus users is visible to off-campus users. however, i have
provided symlinks so http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/ubuntu (or centos or debian or
whatever) will work for everyone. these links or needed, for example, for
debian, since we have to be visible at the same url to all users.

pkg-get is pretty apt like... definitely not a substitute but at least
it does dependency resolution

Hi all,
I have compiled 2.6.18 kernel from source and I  get boot error mesg as follows:

########error#############
mount:  error 6 mounting ext3
mount: error 2 mounting none upto 200000000@8000-11000
switchroot: mount failed: 22
umount /initrd/dev failed: 2
##########error############

ext3.o module is compiled into the kernel and is visible with lsmmod.
then, thought it was coz of a corrupt initrd image, and did:
mkinitrd -f -v initrd-2.6.18.img 2.6.18 
and replaced the image in /boot dir with the newlty created one too , but in vain.

Am i missing something ? 

regards,
KM

It is either "compiled into the kernel" or "visible with lsmod" - not both.

Can you post your grub or lilo bootloader contents?
What value are you passing to "root="?

AFAIK, lsmod displays loaded modules, not built-in.
Can you check if you have compiled in the support?

I have pasted my "grep CONSOLE .config" and menu.lst entry as you have

the file .config at pastebin.com under the name Sivaram.

checked for ext3.ko in /lib/modules/2.6.18/kernel/fs by 'find'. coudnt find it.
so went back and checked my kernel compilation process.
At menuconfig, i have selected ext3 support to be inbuilt (shown as [*] in menuconfig) - but couldnt find ext3.ko in /lib/modules/2.6.18/kernel/fs directory after kernel installation.

have used the steps as follows  for kernel compilation:
1)make O=/home/km/custom_kernel menuconfig
2)make O=/home/km/custon_kernel 
3)make O=/home/km/custom_kernel modules_install install

am i missing something ?

Dear Readers,

First off, on behalf of the whole team of LINUX For You, here's wishing 
a very happy Dussehra and Diwali to the whole community.

This month, LINUX For You has bundled another 'hugely-requested' distro 
DVD with it - CentOS 4.4 - which many believe is the closest one can get 
to RHEL for free.

On the editorial front, we have a mega story on the trends in Linux and 
open source usage in the mighty Banking, Financial Services and 
Insurance (BFSI) sector of the Indian industry. Along with this, we have 
our regular hardware focus on 'Linux Laptops' and software focus on 
Linux based High Performance Computing Solutions.

Under the opinions section, this month, the community opines on how 
India can develop a community of open source developers and thus become 
a 'net-giver' to the open source world. Also, in the 'Down Memory Lane' 
series, we look at the history of the GNOME project.

This is how pastebin works..

1. You paste stuff on pastebin
2. Pastebin gives you link
3. You give link to us and hope we solve your problem.

Now, where's the pastebin link ?

So, basically it has not been installed, or not
compiled at all. 

Can you check in your kernel sources, fs/ext3/ to see
if there is an ext3.ko module?

> 2)make O=/home/km/custon_kernel 

This should have failed then, if ext3 was enabled and
not compiled.

ya that is what it looks like. i dont have ext3 dir in /lib/modules/2.6.18/fs after installing kernel.
.config shows ext3 fs to be compiled as an inbuilt module.
is that something odd going on at compilation ?

If 95% dont even care to give this simple feedback would democracy really be
ravaged by just ignoring their preference and go ahead with reply-to munging
anyway?!!

As someone already mentioned, this is a feature the need for which is felt
most by regular post'ers. So it does not really bother the 'silent' majority
whether the reply-to field is munged or not.

This problem has been fixed. Here was the cause and soln ....

<Shashi writes>

The problem is identified. There was no problem with the NIC. tcpdump on
the linux system's NIC reveled that one of the Win2k3 server which was
passing through the linux system was bombing packets
to outside on "micorsoft.ds" port and were getting dropped by the iptables
rules. The rush of packets were so huge that the kernel could not handle.
That Win2k3 system was checked and rebooted, after which things turn to
normal. I am on the process of identifying the application which was bombing
packets.

Subject: [Ilugc] Weird problem in Emacs
Message-ID: <452374DE.7080307@gmail.com>

Hello LUGies,

I am facing a weird problem in Emacs since I upgraded my Ubuntu dapper 
drake to edgy beta a couple of days ago. I have tried asking it in 
various related IRC channels (#ubuntu, #ubuntu+1, #ubuntu-in, #emacs), 
but have got no answers/help than from few people who pointed out me 
that it might me some problem with locales and X.

Problem: When I open Emacs, I get boxes in the content area, where text 
should have got displayed. The same exists with tool tips. The menu 
texts are disfigured.

When I try,

Options --> Mule (Multilingual Environment) --> Font/Fontsets  --> 16 
bit - standard

then I get text in the content area as usual, but still not in the tool 
tips. And, this is not a permanent solution as well.

I tried:

* Remove .emacs file and reload, no change
* Remove all pakcages related to emacs, reinstall and check, no change
* Use friends' .emacs file, no change

Then did some google, as people pointed it out that there might be a 
locale settings problem. I have scim input method ON and one of the 
packages uim-common (which is input method library for korean, chinese 
and other languages) shows some errors during install. But, I have been 
able to work with scim for tamil (phonetic).

Then, when I was trying to remove emacs, it installed xemacs and it is 
working well except a error is shown in a seperate window, containing 
this message..

"(1) (xim-xlib/warning) Can't get fontset resource for Input Method"

Also, when I fire up xemacs from the terminal, it shows this...

"(1) (xim-xlib/warning) Can't get fontset resource for Input Method"

I also crossed checked this with my .xsession-errors file, which also 
has the same warning message.

(gnome-panel:4775): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_style_finalize: assertion 
`style->attach_count == 0' failed
Warning: Missing charsets in String to FontSet conversion
Warning: Missing charsets in String to FontSet conversion
Warning: Unable to load any usable fontset

I also made a search in launchpad which led me to these two bugs,

[1] https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/hoary/+source/emacs21/+bug/576
[2] https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xfig/+bug/2066

I did a "sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales" but don't know how to set 
locales to ISO-8859-1 as told in the second bug report as a solution.

Am not getting a clue where things have screwed up and how to fix this. 
Is there any way out ? Any pointers ? :)

(Humble Request: Please don't say "use Vi", am using it for time being, 
but for me 'emacs is emacs')

Hi,
> How about the SCSI controller's driver?

The SCSI controllers driver is compiled as a module.
After installing kernel, i have remade the ramdisk 
loading the necessary modules by:

mkinitrd --preload=scsi_mod --preload=sd_mod \
         --with=ata_piix initrd-2.6.18.img 2.6.18
then reboot  which landed me in the error mentioned  previously.

initrd or not, as a rule of thumb, I've found that any module that's
100% essential for bootup (root fs type, scsi controller et al) gets
compiled into the kernel rather than as a module.

Saves grief, that ..

eth0 is probably your ethernet card

Your wifi card would get detected as eth1

Run whatever app fedora has to add a new network interface and see what
you get.  The eth1 is probably deactivated.

Or see if your laptop has a switch to turn wifi off / on - check if
that's off by any chance.

For me, when I tried Fedora, the Wifi didn't work whereas it worked
with Ubuntu. The interface came up as ath0. I believe most cards work
only if you use ndiswrappers and windows drivers (or some such) which
Fedora refuses to do.

You can do it that way, but it needn't be. All my boxes run the stock
Redhat kernel which has just about everything as modules, but they all
still boot (despite being on HP SmartArray RAID controller and ext3).

To the OP: Did you verify if your custom initrd has all the modules
that you need? Boot into the stock kernel, make a list of modules that
are needed, and check inside your kernel/initrd etc. to see if you
have all those available at boot time.

Binand - the guy is using a centrino (aka ipw2200) driver. Intel has a
native linux driver for it - http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net

So no need to use a wrapper like ndiswrapper to run windows drivers for
the card.

ath0 suggests that your card is on an Atheros chipset.  You dont need
ndiswrapper for that either. http://www.madwifi.org is your friend.

Prashanth - did you put the firmware - available from
ipw2200.sourceforge.net - for your ipw2200 card into the appropriate
location?  Say /lib/firmware?  [find the appropriate location for your
distro]

Thats because Ubuntu ships with proprietary firmware and drivers by 
default while Fedora does not. You can get firmware from third party 
repositories or project websites like http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/ 
and get it working fine. The Intel wireless drivers were present in the 
Fedora kernel for a while before it was upstreamed. With the firmware in 
place, it wouldnt require ndiswrapper.

Most of the universe (and some restricted) package directories seem
blank. For example, see:

http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/ubuntu/pool/universe/e/erc/

I will request Dr.Sriram to llok into this.

Sorry. Ubuntu does not ship proprietary firmware *by default* Its main
repos contains only Free Software. If a firmware is available in any
default installation of Ubuntu it *is* Free Software. To get any
proprietary stuff you might need to add the other repos.

Request you not to make false claims.

it may take a few days before we are able to sync up properly. for some 
reason i am not able to readily see, the rsync jobs are dying. there is 
about 30gb or so of stuff to download, so it will take a few days. i will 
make an announcement when the mirror is usable.

You might want to check http://fasmz.org/~pterjan/blog/?date=20060609.

All,

I am not sure whether am the only one thinking like this.

Does LUG concentrate only on Ubuntu ?. I dont see much discussion or even
queries being raised with other distros. And also I myself have posted a lot
about Freespire , but no response or discussion (navaladi asked for cds, but
i could not give it to him :( ).Is lug promoting Ubuntu or ??.....there are
lots of distro which makes day-to-day activities simpler and Ubuntu is not
the only one...

P.S
If am wrong, am sorry..this is not to create problems. Just a concern....

The LUG cares about what it uses

Some LUGs care a lot about debian - and ilughyd a few years ago was full
of slackware users

Nobody uses freespire / linspire here except for you I guess - so while
the LUG members would generally wish it well, they wouldn't want to talk
about it.

Thank you :-). Its wonderful to have a repository so close by.
dist-upgrades will be a cinch if you can haul your PC/Hard Disk to some

Please note that non-Free Software are not on Main Repos.  Please read
the section under "Ubuntu "main" Component Licence Policy"

Also your quote is half stripped... The remaining part of the quote goes here..

"All of the application software installed by default is Free
Software. In addition, we install some hardware drivers that are
available only in binary format, <bold>but such packages are clearly

So binary only drivers are installed by default according to the above

Indeed. My 3Com wireless card works in WPA mode in Ubuntu, but not in
any of the other distros I tried (FC5, OpenSuse etc.). It is 100%
certain that the reason for that is Ubuntu ships binary drivers for
the card.

Does it really matter that ilugc subscribers should be able to verify
your signature and ensure themselves that you are indeed, the author
of the message? Are you being impersonated so much that you find it
necessary to add about 10 extra lines to every message of yours (which
is distributed to about 1500 people, I reckon about 5 MB of frivolous
data)?

If yes, then continue to do so. If no, can you please stop?

Message-ID: <92f9a9560610041247h7889efeye2bcbbd3f5c67890@mail.gmail.com>

Here is a ext2 file system driver for Windows:
    http://fs-driver.org/

Ext3 is backwards compatible, so you can still mount it
as an ext2 file systems.  Since fs-driver opearates in
the Windows kernel as an IFS, it should offer excellent
performance and compatibility with other win32 tools.

The only problem I see is that the current incarnation
ignores file ownership/group.

Pity I stopped using ext2/3 many moons ago...

its about the usuage of linux (which ever distro it is) to the comman
people like me. i love the best product(which i consider) and i take
the best among the availability. i guess lug is not limited to any
particular distro. if many people asking question abt ubuntu, it means
they are using it and they want to get info from ILUGC about their
issues. its not ILUGC promoting ubuntu.

but many people(not me) think ubuntu solves their day to day
activities and thats why they are using it and raising questions here
which concerns them.

Message-ID: <4524AC26.5090506@gmail.com>

Thunderbird 1.5.0.7 on Windows XP SP2.

I was using the vertical view like I used to in Outlook. Very convenient 
layout on a wide screen. Some sloppy fingers and I do not know which 
keys got pressed, the vertical pane showing the message list collapsed 
to a minimum width with no text seen. If the cursor is taken to the 
frame border, the double headed arrow cursor comes up but drag does 
nothing to expand the frame.

Any clues? If I need to edit the config like in Mozilla, I'll. I do not 
know how and which variables. Google did not help here.

The application window size and other customizations are stored in

Edit it or move it aside to get the default settings.

Did that. removed extensions.rdf etc... This works well in the safe mode 
but not in the standard mode. Am getting an error in the javascript

well it is filling alphabetically - so we get pool/main first, pool/multiverse
after that followed by pool/restricted and finally pool/universe. when the rsync
dies and is restarted, it starts over from the beginning (but will, of course,
quickly get to where it left off since only changes have to be downloaded now).
the farthest we got was universe/m, so there is nothing after that. it is right
now at universe/b and i expect it to finish by friday morning IST. of course,
you are supposed to look at the archive-update-in-progress file at the root of
the tree and realize that - the update is in progress! one of the reasons rsync
is dying may be because of files that get deleted while the download is still in
progress.

figured out the problem !

just need to comment in dumpkeys|loadkeys --unicode

or to be kernel specific i have used,

[ `uname -r`=="2.6.18"] || dumpkeys | loadkeys --unicode
(this seems to be a bug fixed in kbd v1.2)

in 'unicode_start' script.

You can get it back by hitting the F8 key (which toggles the message
pane on and off). BTW, what's ILUGC got to do with Windows XP SP2 ;-)

Creating a new profile was the solution. This only toggles but does not 
change pane size.

This was to do with Thunderbird not Windows. Habit of specifying full 
environment and versions before specifying the problem led me to mention 
that.

Subject: [Ilugc] Intex RTL813D ( Silan SC92031 ) ethernet card driver
Message-ID: <4525D747.3010505@gmx.net>

Hi,

Yesterday, I bought an el-cheapo Intex LAN card and the driver CD packed
with it didn't have a linux driver. After a little bit of googling, I
found the linux driver but it only compiles for kernel 2.4/2.5.
There's no official driver for kernel 2.6

I have modified the sources to compile the driver for Kernel 2.6.
A lot many people seem to have this Lan card (because it's cheap) and
may want to use it under newer linux distros.

So to help them..the modified source files can be downloaded from:
http://gurukumara.googlepages.com/sc92031_2.6.tar.gz

Good work! I have been avoiding Intex cards as I am told they are crappy but if you can get them working it is excellent.

I too wasn't successful with Intex though I think it failed with FreeBSD rather than linux.

I am sure your work will benefit everyone. Congrats! I am very happy. :-)

It is normally available in all distributions may be in the
first/second cd.

If you are using debian just do apt-get install xinetd.

No idea where in Chennai you could get those, but do you mean:

1. An out-of-band ethernet-based server management system ("Lights-out
Management")?
2. Wake-on-lan capability in your server?
3. Something entirely different?

Most off the shelf servers these days come with 1 & 2 above. I have
never heard of 1 above for desktops/workstations, but I know that IBM
laptops and certain other vendors/products do support WOL.

Message-ID: <3B0F930A-A555-4165-9B79-CCBC520229D7@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

it looks like the voting is stuck at 61. In this context, i would  
like to get the views of the list on this thing.

1. As far as I am concerned, the very idea of 'one man one vote' in  
foss sends shivers up my spine. That is not how foss works. Those who  
contribute most get to decide what is to be done.

2. Unfortunately, i am also a code-coolie and the temptation to write  
a voting app overrode my good sense.

3. So we have 61 people who have voted. Which means that 61 people  
care about where this list is going.

4. The rest are the 'great silent majority' which helped bush to  
invade iraq ...

5. I have looked at the results and it is 55 for and 6 against

6. As far as i can see, all voters are genuine members of the mailing  
list

frankly I see no profit in publicising the results. I could forward  
the results to sriram for verification and publication, but that  
would fracture the lug. Chennai lug is the premier lug in india - and  
one of the best in the world.

ok guys, what is to be done? do  we wait for some magic potion to  
wake the zombies? Or do you  want the results posted on the internet?

It'll be too late if you wait downloads from:

ftp://archive.download.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/8.0/en/iso/i386
ftp://archive.download.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/9/en/iso/i386

Message-ID: <20061006185556.52604.qmail@web50201.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,

Sorry for the late reply.

I have downloaded a 2.6.17 Linux kernel, compiled it
on an Intel PIII system running Debian Sarge. It boots
fine with ext3 filesystem on IDE hard-disk. The
filesystem options in the .config are as follows:

#
# File systems
#
CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y
CONFIG_EXT2_FS_XATTR=y
# CONFIG_EXT2_FS_POSIX_ACL is not set
# CONFIG_EXT2_FS_SECURITY is not set
# CONFIG_EXT2_FS_XIP is not set
CONFIG_EXT3_FS=y
CONFIG_EXT3_FS_XATTR=y
CONFIG_EXT3_FS_POSIX_ACL=y
CONFIG_EXT3_FS_SECURITY=y
CONFIG_JBD=y
CONFIG_JBD_DEBUG=y
CONFIG_FS_MBCACHE=y
# CONFIG_REISERFS_FS is not set
# CONFIG_JFS_FS is not set
CONFIG_FS_POSIX_ACL=y
# CONFIG_XFS_FS is not set
# CONFIG_OCFS2_FS is not set
# CONFIG_MINIX_FS is not set
CONFIG_ROMFS_FS=y
CONFIG_INOTIFY=y
CONFIG_QUOTA=y
# CONFIG_QFMT_V1 is not set
# CONFIG_QFMT_V2 is not set
CONFIG_QUOTACTL=y
# CONFIG_DNOTIFY is not set
CONFIG_AUTOFS_FS=y
# CONFIG_AUTOFS4_FS is not set
# CONFIG_FUSE_FS is not set

I try to avoid the distro kernels, because they are
always tweaked, modified, and patched by the distro
kernel maintainers. I prefer to compile a stock kernel
from kernel.org.

Steps followed (for reference):

 cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.17
 make clean
 make menuconfig
 make
 make modules_install
 make install
 yaird -o /boot/initrd-2.6.17.img 2.6.17

I have not used the make-kpkg tool from Debian. yaird
is yet another mkinitrd.

Those drivers doesnt have the vendor id for silan card  to be  specified in
pci  table,
may be adding it may work thats what i found on googling,

Had you used make-kpkg, all you'd have had to do would have been:

fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --revision mykernel1.0 kernel_image in
place of make... + yaird. That is the only difference.

It compiles the kernel, uses mkinitramfs, yaird etc. in the
background, and generates a deb with the kernel, so is easier to
handle.

Dear KG,

First of all, I voted against munging; even yesterday, I had to send a
reply off list to a mail message on the list; and I merely had to hit
reply and things worked smoothly. I use the other reply option if I
want to reply to list in my mail client. However, when I do not have
the luxury of using this mail client (Mutt), I also undergo the same
pain which you undergo. Therefore, if most of you are in that
situation, I think the greatest good for the greatest number dictates
that munging must be done!

Now, again, I'd like to know whether Mailman is going to be patched
sometime in future to ask "Munge/Don't munge" along with
"Digest/Individual" on a per user basis. Here's an old thread I found,
but I don't know what came out of it...

http://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-developers/2003-April/015037.html

So, can't Mailman be patched to give this freedom to subscribers? I
couldn't find out the current status, so I ask on the list.

Thanks.

Kumar

   Hmm, I believe that you can almost always use glibc-2.3.x
from FC3 without much fear of dangling references or unmet
dependencies, but YMMV. Most of the other libs have compat-*
packages in FC that can be installed or rebuilt to meet
dependencies. Check all the Fedora distros for the compat-*
packages.

   Anyways, I have RH9, but it's in Madras and I'm in B'lore
now - so it's difficult to get hold of until the end of the month.

Message-ID: <c293dd340610062248s61c554ffm2c5d88459896b4eb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

A couple of hardware related queries,

1. Any recommendations for good 4-pin IDE disk power connectors ?
The ones which come with the el-cheapo SMPS's get worn out in a year
and start to fall apart. There seem to cheap Rs.5/- available in
Ritchie Street which serve as extensions but they seem to be brittle
and don't even last a month.

2. Any good 400W SMPS available. The 400W one seems to be the only one
available with the max wattage. I need a SMPA to drive a Nvidia
Geforce 7XXX card(it needs a power connector!) and 4 PATA IDE disks.
The 400W onw seems to hold up for now but it's an el-cheapo one which
suffers from problem 1(above). Any good 400W+ SMPS available in
chennai ?

PS: We need a Chennai Homebrew Computer Club for general H/W discussions. :P

1. Each .iso download on a BSNL connection gives an
ETA of 10 hours, and a lot more if all are downloaded
at once.

2. I don't have the luxury of running my machines for
long hours.

Parthan said he will hand over a copy of the CDs to me
today.

Thanks,

   There are numerous problems with current el-cheapo PSUs, including
connectors and cables. If you're willing to desolder/solder etc., you can
look for high-quality '80s scrap AT PSUs at Ritchie St. (say Rs.50 each)
with good Molex connectors and *thick* cables, and do some transplants.

>  Any good 400W+ SMPS available in

   Most of the PSUs available here have fake ratings, usually 2x the
real rating. In practice, 250W (real) should be sufficient for most
apps., including yours, but they're hard to find. Look for a Dell/Hipro
250W PFC ATX PSU, and replace all secondary capacitors over
470uF with Nichicon or Matsushita low-ESR long-life professional
grade types, and you'll be OK for the next 10-20 years.

   The other good brands worth salvaging/upgrading are Delta, Etasis,
Enhance, Sparkle, Fortron, AcBel. They're hard to find in India, but
scrap IBM/HP and other obsolete MNC boxes may yield Deltas.
Any Delta over 180W should be OK.

   In the worst case, shell out about Rs.3k-5k for a HP Kayak PII/PIII
dual-processor server, and cannibalize it for the 385W Delta PSU
that it has - that PSU is worth its weight in gold. It may require rewiring
of the ATX connector though - it's probably 24-pin, not 20-pin.

-Siva

P.S. Avoid Deer/L&C, Allied, Powmax and Bestec like the plague.
They aren't worth their scrap value, but they're usually the only
ones available locally, usually rebadged as a Mercury or Kobian
or similar. PrimeSource sometimes has rebadged Enhance or
Fortron/Sparkle - they're OK, but Fortron/Sparkle has started
using cheap Chinese capacitors over the last few years in
basically good circuit designs.

Message-ID: <d2a92d610610070322y6517c479n5239ba574fa6d5b4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Does anyone know if Firefox supports non-local font types like EOT
(MSIE) or PFR (Netscape) either natively or via extensions? How about
other less common browsers like Opera or Safari or Konqueror?

Quite a lot of vernacular news websites and others use these font
types, which sort of ties the surfer to IE.

Alternatively, does anyone know how one can covert the EOT/PFR font
files back to TTF? Gatesware has a free download which does this the
other way, from TTF to EOT. I haven't been able to find anything that
manages to reverse this.

TIA,

Binand

What distro you are using?.. rpm comes by default only in some distros like

Maybe, but I don't think so. From the extension's page, it looks to me
as if it converts "the following dynamic font schemes" (which is
basically what EOT or PFR is) to Unicode. Now, from my understanding
of Unicode, it is just an encoding and doesn't actually specify the
font. Thus, I need the font specified by the website locally installed
anyway to use this extension - that is, I am back at square one
(especially if the dynamic font is rather obscure and is not available
as a TTF).

I'll give it a try though. and post about my adventures into the world
of proprietary fonts and vernacular websites :)

AFAIK, mozilla/firefox doesn't have any built-in support for
dynamic fonts. I doubt they even have it in their future plans. The
extension I mentioned actually translates the text encoding to unicode
so that they can be seen using the unicode fonts installed in your
system. By this I mean, you can even copy & paste the text to gedit
and it will still be unicode and viewable if you have any unicode font.

I have no idea about malayalam fonts but unless you are into DTP and
want to print a page with the exact font the site uses, IMHO, it doesn't
really matter :-)

Disclaimer: I am not an authority on this stuff, the below is just
what I think the situation is.

I think it matters with Malayalam. If you look up the Wikipedia entry
on Malayalam, you will find:

"Malayalam now consists of 56 letters including 20 long and short
vowels and the rest consonants. The earlier style of writing is now
substituted with a new style from 1981. This new script reduces the
different letters for typeset from 900 to less than 90. This was
mainly done to include Malayalam in the keyboards of typewriters and
computers."

Now, my problem is with the new style introduced from 1981. As far as
I can make out, Malayalam Unicode has only this new style in it.
Unfortunately, my Malayalam education has been in the "old" style and
hence I find it quite difficult to read the new one (that is,
Unicode-enabled Malayalam sites). I suppose it is only a matter of
practice :)

You can see for yourself (www.mangalam.com):

http://www.subinium.org/q/m.html

The left-hand side is with Padma translating the page to Unicode, the
right-hand side is without. You can see there are some differences
(mainly, the "chillaksharams" are gone), and I find the right-hand
side version faster and easier to read.

well, it is sunday morning and still going. i am afraid i mis-estimated the size

about 35gb.

I am actually surprised! How is it that Ubuntu is so large? Is it that
multiple versions of the same package is installed? I did check it
out; but it seems that multiple versions are needed to make them work
across Warty, Dapper and Edgy (I think); maybe some more experienced
Ubuntu'er can chip in with the explanation.

In any case, I hope people make good use of this once the mirror is
complete.

I find the right hand side much better. I think that is true Malayalam. The left hand side seems like a bastardised version. :-)

Frankly it took me quite some time to figure out what you were saying. Phew!

I really thought you were nitpicking but later understood that you certainly have a point.

Anyway how is it that my firefox renders it so perfectly? I have not installed any font. What is the magic?

Is everyone else also able to view?

Localization is a huge topic and I never understood anything. :-)

You could use S5 for creating JavaScript+CSS based slide shows.

Thanks Kenneth.

I should have rephrased the question, 

   
  " I want javascript code for viewing a bunch of photos without doing anything. I want to click the URL, sit back and relax. Let the fotos show one after another ..."

  I think I should specify even further. The list of fotos can either be statically built into the code or still better, read from a directory. I am interested in code, dont send me some third party app or link. :-)

  Can someone write a quick 10 line code and share? I am sure many of you are wonderful javascript/php/ajax programmers. 

  This must be really simple for u guys. :-)

Thanks a lot Prashanth. Check my last e-mail.

I have a bunch of digital fotos taken either from my cell phone or digital camera. I want to share it with my friends/relatives.

What does a guy do? Publish it in yahoo! fotos. Eeek! Not good at all.

The better alternative is www.flickr.com

Now, nobody has the patience to click on the fotos one after another. So ppl want a slideshow, an automated one with sensible timeout, say 4 seconds.

And the problem with flick is it reduces the image size drastically. I dont want that. At the same time I dont want u to click and drag the scrollbars also.

IOW, just display the fotos one after another,that is all. Without any resizing or processing.

Simple, isnt it?

Whenever we hackers design a technical solution, the first thing that shud come to our minds is the psychology of the end user.

Does the user really want this feature?

Am I making things really complicated for him/her to use?

Best way is to develop something and ask for feedback.

Still better is to wear the dumb user hat urself and think.

What do I want the program to do for me? :-)

love,
Girish

That is the reason i suppose. Hoary's life cycle is about to end. So
at the moment mirroring 3 supported versions explains the size. But
then syncing from official ubuntu mirrors on 20mbps pipe takes max 2
days to sync.

Subject: [Ilugc] [IRC] #ilugchennai - Weekly meeting point ?!
Message-ID: <45290AEE.1050709@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Me and Shakthi had an informal meeting today where we felt the need for 
interacting on a regular basis within the ilugc. Our thought was, rather 
than asking people to present themselves physically at some place (which 
as far as now is only during Monthly Meets in IITM), we thought of 
having online meets in IRC. Our idea is, we can meet at a specific time 
at an IRC channel during the weekend and discuss. This will help people 
who are not present in Chennai but are actively involved with ilugc 
Mailing list to interact with the other members who are in chennai. 
Also, this will keep the LUG active even when there are no Monthly 
Meets, GLVs or other activities around. Also, the understanding and 
interaction between our active members will better as well as nwebies to 
ilugc might be able to get along with the existing members.

In regards to the above idea, I have registered #ilugchennai channel 
with irc.freenode.net. This will serve as our online meeting ground. We 
wish ilugc members who have access to internet can join us every 
weekend, Sundays around 11 a.m. The day and time is tentative and 
subjected to change depending upon the feedbacks of the majority.

All suggestions, ideas, comments, criticisms are welcome along with a 
minimal flame :)

 well, it is sunday morning and still going. i am afraid i
 mis-estimated the size of pool/universe. as of now, we are at
 pool/universe/p and the universe tree is already about 25gb. the
 rest of the stuff put together is about 30gb. that makes ubuntu the
 biggest tree in the ftp.iitm mirror, even more than debian, which is
 about 35gb.
    

 I am actually surprised! How is it that Ubuntu is so large? Is it that
 multiple versions of the same package is installed? I did check it
 out; but it seems that multiple versions are needed to make them work
 across Warty, Dapper and Edgy (I think); maybe some more experienced
 Ubuntu'er can chip in with the explanation.

 In any case, I hope people make good use of this once the mirror is
 complete.

I have not used IRC all that much.  Can you please explain how
the interaction on IRC will be different from the mailing list?

Conversation's are more informal. You need to have an _agenda_ to
interact with the LUG as is required on the mailing list. Also
non-chennai ILUGUC folk can drop in to say a 'hi' to LUG friends.

But do we need a _separate_ channel ? Isn't #linux-india good enough ?

Ah, I see lots of global variables, and poorly written code.

Fine, I've managed to quickly whip a trivial implementation of a slide

I believe my code is self explanatory ;-)

Yes, as Toufeeq said, its more like an online conference room (much 
similar to a 'chat room' of yahoo messenger, but a bit moderated. People 
can login with the nick of their choice and participate in the 
discussions, while the ops have certain degree of control over keeping 
the temperature of the channel (conf room) under control. Also, people 
from other LUGs who usually hang out in various other channels can drop 
in. We can set a 'topic' for the discussion for the particular day which 
will be displayed to everyone joining in the channel.

> But do we need a _separate_ channel ? Isn't #linux-india good enough ?
Topa, you do know about #linux-india. As we are normally hanging out 
there, it might not be a problem for us. But, when we are planning to 
have some weekend meeting kinda wrt ilugc, we felt that using 
#linux-india might not be the best choice, as other people usually 
hanging there might feel uncomfortable with discussing too much of ilugc 
related stuff/ flooding of people from ilugc ( too much expectation, i 
agree! ;) ). Rather than debating whether there might occur any issues 
in having ilugc meets in #linux-india, we felt that we can have a 
channel for our own, so that we do not embarrass anyone else :)

Hi Shakthi and All,

It worked finally. I passed the parameter vga=0 and it worked. When I 
gave the option vga=ask and manually
selected the option 0,1,2,3 worked properly and 4,5,6 had the problem.
When I posted this query Bharathi suggested this, i tried only 4,5,6 
then and assumed the other options
will also have problem(stupid of me).
I am yet to configure the X, i think i have to enable some drivers 
during the compilation.

regards,
siva.

It is for use in a GFS cluster where an errant node can be 'fenced' by sane
nodes. I do not know which of the above category it falls under! Maybe its
like the lights out management but for a pc class box - not server class
machines.

The idea to have #ilugchennai was to provide a channel / a place were 
weekly online meeting of ilugc can happen, not disturbing the other 
channels which are visited by people from all over India. This channel 
is not created as a separate 24X7 channel for ILUG-Chennai, rather the 
main aim is a place where ilugc members can discuss without embarrassing 
others who may not be interested in the activities of ilugc (if done in 
a channel of larger scope like #linux-inida).

delhi guys discuss delhi affairs, mumbai guys discuss their affairs,  
chennai guys also discuss their affairs - no one is embarrassed so  
far. I dont see any need for a separate channel.

and as long as its linux and not (say) your love affairs you're
discussing, I dont see where the embarassment factor comes in

you can always use dcc chat to have a private conversation between two
or three people, spearate from a bunch of people in the same irc chatroom

Think it will be explained in the file named 'INSTALL' taking that to be 
a text file. Normally you should be able to do (when you have a Makefile),

user@comp$cd alien
user@comp$./configure
user@comp$make
user@comp$make install

if it says any permission errors, use a 'sudo' before the commands. 
Never do these things as 'root' user, please use super user permissions 
for installation tasks if necessary.

Its great that your have created a channel. but why not we also join
#linux-india and discuss there instead of limiting our boundries to
chennai. i guess there are more talents available in linux-india. we
should be part of it.

As already stated, Gallery2 soes that.

Nobody who knows flicr well would mass upload using their
interface. That's why they use the API or use programs that use the
API. I have found KDE's gwenview to be very good at uploading to
flickr. Also check flickrfs, which uses FUSE to make your flickr
account look like a mounted directory.

Thatis your choice, but personally, I'd not like to see images larger
than 1024x768 on the 15 inch monitors I have access to.

Hi Ravindar,

If there is a **real** need, then going with RPM in Ubuntu can be
entertained,else, this is real risky becoz Ubuntu is not built to work with
RPM files. And moreover, Debian Package Management is the best than RPM.

Can you please share the need for installing RPM in Ubuntu and also is
there  a specific RPM package you are trying to install in Ubuntu ?

And also, please do explain things rather than pasting the output :(

Thanks.

you need to sign-up and use their proprietary software, but it gets
the job done.

Nope. Stick to mediawiki. Only, lock down who can signup for accounts

That will stop spambots from creating accounts, etc.

Any reason to move away from Mediawiki? Seems to me it is the most
feature-rich Wiki software out there. And considering that it powers
Wikipedia, it should be the most actively developed one as well.

Message-ID: <452A0223.3030104@aim.com>

Hi,

    I am running Debian 3.1 sarge.   I was using a 17' CRT monitor with 
screen resolution 1024x768 & 61Hz, and Now, i have got a new IBM 
ThinkVision LCD monitor.  When i connected it, it says "Input signal out 
of range".  So i changed XF86Config-4 file to make 1280x1024 as default 
screen setting. 

    Now i am get the GUI, but a black color box with "Input Signal out 
of range" is moving all over screen.  I think there is a problem with 
refresh rates.

How can i configure the settings? Plz Help me guys.

Thanks in advance.

Arun Velusamy.

This is an anecdote I anyway was planning to share with everyone at ILUGC.

I installed Win XP and Debian with a 55 25 GB ratio.

I must have been foolish when I did that since I thought, "Hey my Windoze partition can record TV, so I need a big fat disk..."

But guess what. After working for many moons :-) I got my TV card working much much better than the company supplied drivers for Windoze. Even tuning will not work properly in Windoze.

With the result that I never booted into Windoze since.

Then my partition in Debian started getting filled up like mad. I was at my wit's end.

Until the moment I heard about gparted in a FreeBSD mailing list.

I downloaded their liveUSB.. didnt work.

Then I booted their liveCD. Wow man! Marvellous piece of software. It is serious fun.

I shrunk the Windoze partition thus freeing up space.

Then I hit cfdisk and to my dismay I cannot further partition the free space. So I just did a mkfs.ext3 and added a mount point in /etc/fstab.

I think I should have actually gone in for XFS but then it is okay. :-)

I think gparted will drive paritionmagic out of business.

Whenever a free tool does better than a proprietary tool it is time to party. :-)

gparted is both graphical and easy to use and it is very well written.

I am unfortunately unable to comment on the various other alternatives proposed.

My dear Kumar,

   There is a cultural issue here. Let me tackle it right away.

   There is a certain joy in doing things yourself , to suit your tastes. Even if there are more successful better tools out there, I still prefer to do whatever I can myself.

   Why? 

   If the task is simple I should do it myself as only I can know what I really want. 

   In this particular case, I know for sure that javascript is the right tool for the job.

   Let me share an anecdote again. I hope you understand and appreciate the value of doing things yourself to suit your tastes...

   I used the script I sent to share certain fotos. 

   Since the images are not so big in terms of file size and due to human factors coming in , you really dont need a huge bandwidth to share fotos. So I used my measly 64kbps uplink BSNL line at home.

   Then devil entered my brain ( as usual) and I started doing a 

# less /var/log/apache/access.log

   After that, I figured out that I was able to glean the IP address, the operating system and the specific time that slideshow is accessed. I can also see the time that person spent and the fotos he/she viewed.

   What use is an IP address? I copy it and paste it on 

   http://www.geobytes.com/IpLocator.htm?GetLocation

   and I get the accurate coordinates of the IP address.

   Since most of my folks are distributed across the world, I can very clearly point my finger on who actually accessed the link.

   I find that IP addresses in India are not properly listed in that database, at least the city and states are not so accurate. But I have not used it much.

   But I have seen this work very well when it comes to developed nations.
   
   Another idea that came to my mind is to use the Listen and Port directiver in httpd.conf to run the slideshow/website in multiple ports and send different links to different ppl, that way you can know who accessed when.

   What to talk of marvels of modern technology? :-)

   Ethics aside, the fact that it is possible to do this is interesting.

My idea is to keep things simple. I will first run all my images thro' a resizer tool like convert or something and get all images to fit a 15 " screen.

Then the slideshow will just flip the images.

I like the UNIX idea of different tools doing different jobs at different times.

On the fly manipulations and generic processing IMHO doesn't gell well with UNIX thinking...

Don't worry. We are all with you. Nobody actually gets X config right the first time especially if you are using Debian. Unless the machine is old your chances are slim of getting it right on new hardware.

Let me give a small theoretical dump. 

I think LCD monitors work thro' CRT emulation. I must be wrong, but X at least right now understand CRT picture tube funda better than LCD transistors I guess.

So you have a vertical refresh rate and a horizontal scan frequency. One is in Hz and another in KiloHz. And for a given resolution and color depth, not all values work.

So that is what you have to tune. Normally the PAL television screen shows 25 frames a second. And since it is interlaced scanning, the PAL refresh rate is 50 Hz. Two scans per frame.

Now, our computer monitors can do much much better. In fact I even hear 110 Hz. If the refresh rate is too low, you perceive flicker. And if it is high enough, it is soothing to the eyes.

And the other parameter is given in kiloHz and that is related to what your monitor can actually do.

There is also a standard called DPMS using which the monitor can be queried for its capabilities.

Anyway I think I have given you just too much useless information and no practical advice.

All the best!

Gopal,

	You have done a marvellous job as usual. What's new? :-)

	I had the courage to actually replace the old junk with your code and it works like a charm. :-) Should I pay any royalty to you? :-)

	One small question please. Is it possible to specify  a directory so that we can populate our array from the dir instead of hard coding images?

	I guess that should do. No need to do globbing and figure out only iage files. 

	I think if someone can send that patch , it will be great.

	Thanks.

Girish

Kumar,
	Congrats! I am yet to read it. But I will surely do. 

	The first line must be true but I hardly ever use xmms.

	I am very happy with mpg321,ogg123 or mplayer. 

	I am very much into audio processing and I recently had to do a lot of it to remove noise and amplify, filter and enhance an AM radio performance recorded on an audio cassette.

	The results were really impressive. I used sox.

	RTFM soxexam(1)

	I had lot of fun reading it. You can add virtually any effect on earth, add 6 walls for echo, chorus effect, panning, reverbration,echo,echos , companing and so on.

	I think with proper 3D audio system and good speakers, one can do full fledged audio processing with it.

	I used to use audacity as that is also quite powerful. For sound editing like snipping and cutting samples, I much prefer the audacity GUI interface.
	It supports good zooming for cutting certain pesky portions. Hard to get right without zooming.

	Have you tried these?

	Maybe one day I will take a look at xmms...

It certainly didn't reach Gmail, though the MIME headers are visible:

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="slideshow.html"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; name="slideshow.html"

I wonder why. Gmail's XSS filtering?

To get good help please change your habit of simply copying and
pasting the screen output. First specifiy what you were doing, the
nature of problem and then the errors. Also specify the
distribution+version you are using.

>From the  error messages it is clear that gcc compiler and other
utilities like autoconf are not installed. Install gcc and other
related stuff first.

One could open a shell account somewhere outside and use `ssh+screen+irssi'.

Or maybe run a ssh server at home with sshd running on port 80 :-)

CGI-IRC is hosted for free on this server. My personal experiences with
CGI-IRC has been painful... so if SSH is possible screen+irssi could be
a fantastic experience :-)

Hi,
you are having a sources for the package..If you are using debian or
ubuntu, first install build-essential
next
-> './configure --prefix=/<wherever>
->'make' and compile the sources
->'make install' to install the compiled binaries..

There is no portable way to do that.  Also, using JavaScript its not 
possible to access the file system.  But yes, if you are running this 
from a local machine:

   - if you are running Mozilla based web browsers, you can use the 
netscape.security.PrivilegeManager's methods and use the java object 
methods.
   - if you are using IE, you can use the FileSystemObject or something, 
I forgot.

But AFAIK there is no clean way of doing it.

Distros primarily differ in their package management
system. You can still use different free/open source
packages on different distros. Distro really shouldn't
matter.

Hi,

Looks like we didn't need a poll for this one :)

So, #linux-india on irc.freenode.net is fine.

The meeting time, every Sunday 1100-1200 IST is ok?

Thanks for the feedback,

Dear Friends,

I come to you in finding your thoughts, experience and advice on CMS ,
especially finding which one will be apt for me in developing a content
managed portal.I have(atleast i pressume) a good expereince on
Joomla.Theadmin screen of joomla is looking cool like a cake walk for
any new
developer while comparing it with drupal(enlighten me , if i am wrong). I
feel Joomla has sharp and cool templates while compared to Drupal. When i
searched on the web , there is an inner feeling of mine saying that people
tend to move from Joomla to drupal. I admire drupal for its cook features
like multiple instance running of a single installation which is not there
in joomla.

I am in the process of revampping a site which is running with Drupal 4.6 ,
and my existing site has over 700 users. I do know it will be absolutely
meaningless if i move my framework from drupal to joomla. I would like to
know is there any strong point that i have to move from drupal to joomla,
Kindly let me know about the powers of template management in Drupal 4.7.x.

I am coming to you for gaining knowledge from your experience, so  please
dont ask me to google which i have done to my best of my efforts.

Thanking you,

cheers

Thyagu,

Drupal or Joomla depends mainly on two things: (1) The experience and 
skill level of the web developer/designer and (2) the requirements.

Looking at (1), Joomla is preferred for some one who wants things to be 
highly user-friendly, all customization to be done with a few mouse 
clicks and who wishes for a candy web site.

Point (2) holds more details:
* Drupal over rides Joomla with its rock solid performance.
* Drupal will be *the* option, when you have multiple sites or you plan 
to add more sites to your now single site, and looking for an integrated 
management of all your contents.
* Drupal provides features for user permissions and groups, and is very 
useful when you have plans for community or membership sites.
* Drupal doesn't limit your creativeness and is completely flexible, 
compared to Joomla.
* Drupal provides a powerful templating system (which you would have 
experienced) as well it is easy to integrate with other systems.
* Drupal is lenient on the server resources but not Joomla.

Since you are already on Drupal and know/learnt to work around with it, 
then instead of changing to something which is more of an eye candy you 
can better exploit the power of Drupal itself. As already 700 users got 
used to the current system, you can try to improve the candy part of it 
with improved templates. Also, mind about the server resources part if 
you don't have much.

Although I don't practically work on either Drupal or Joomla, this is 
what I got to know. I might be wrong in some points, but not the whole 
idea --> Joomla is for people who want to do things easily, with eye 
candy but compromising the flexibility and the power of the CMS. 
Whereas, Drupal is for people who will love to exploit the power of 
thier CMS to the max, who will sit and write codes and templates, who 
love to play around with the system, and enjoy the superior performance 
and quality of their work :)

Have you set the JAVA_HOME variable? Try putting rt.jar in
/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_12/lib in the CLASSPATH variable or

./javac -classpath  /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_12/lib/rt.jar:.

You haven't set some environment variables properly. Google will
let you know which ones.

you probably want to install the java sdk on ubuntu. If this is the
case, simplying running the following command will work:

$ sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jdk

Hi,
    I am a newbie here and am not sure how to reply to a topic thats already
been started. Someone had requested for recorded Audio of the lectures and
videoconferences at Shaastra 2006. Prof, Arunn Narasimhan, a faculty at
IITM, has posted podcasts of VC by George Olah, Abelson, Parvez Moin, Arno
Penzias and Yash Pal on his blog http://www.arunn.net/scienceblog/ .. As far
as the information I have, the lectures have also been recorded (videos i
mean) and will be put up on the website sometime soon.

cheers,

Evolution comes with the ximian connector for exchange

But that requires OWA (outlook webaccess) to be enabled on exchange

If your exchange has a imap/pop3 and smtp connector installed instead,
that should do just as well

Even though it has an OT tag line, I don't think the post is relevant
at all to Free Software or any related issue. What list members has to
do with the news of someone arrested on suspected murder charge?

I think it has it's context w.r.t the list. Who knows there might be
people following ReiserFS development and this will be news for them.

If Linux Torvalds get's arrested tomorrow , won't the list discuss it ?

Have you heard/used ReiserFS in GNU/Linux and ever tried reading its history
or atleast about its development and the pros and cons of the ReiserFS?. How
can one say that eventhough its tagged OT, its not relevant?.ReiserFS is one
of the popular File Systems in the Free Software and the creator/writer is
now arrested and wont you think that its a news!.OMG!!...so, you would not
even allow people to discuss about Linux torvalds or RMS in this list ??...

Isn't there any ReiserFS developers list?

Even though it has an OT tag line, I don't think the post is relevant
at all to Free Software or any related issue. What list members has to
do with the news of someone arrested on suspected murder charge?

Is this a place to discuss someone's personal life? RMS has asked
everyone to boycott Harry Potter books? Can I discuss it here just
because RMS is coming into the picture?

since the chaks mail is OT, u might understood that it is off topic. u
can too send a mail about RMS asking to boycott harry potter books
mentioning it as OT since it involved RMS if think that it might be
useful to all of us.

Hi Prashanth,

Do you mean that the same paper is there for both 7th and 8th sem exams 
or is it that the same elective is available for both the semesters ?
A list of electives may be offered for 7th sem, also the same list may 
be available for 8th sem. So, you can choose from the same list for both 
the semesters. If thats what you mean, then you can have FOSS-I in 
either of 7th or 8th semesters. If its not what you mean, then enlighten 
me better :D

You mean something like:

dd if=/etc/passwd of=/dev/stdout

Yes, used that way it certainly helps me in checking the contents of
/etc/passwd.

StarDict [stardict.sf.net] is pretty good. Includes a whole bunch of
popular dictionaries (with dubious copyright status) that can be
downloaded from its website.

dd stands for "disk dump" just like grep stands for "graphic regular expression print" and ping stands for "packet internet groper"...


It is mostly used for copying from device files though it is sometimes used to copy back to them as well. It gives you raw access. For instance, this is really cool.

dd if=/dev/cdrom of=cd.iso 

This will get you the cd ISO. In my linux box, cdrom device is /dev/hdc

Note that since it is raw access there is no need to mount. 

It also takes offsets using skip and seek. And you customize how much you want to read or write with count= and bs= parameters.

I use dd for backing up or restoring my MBR since it is guaranteed to be 512 bytes.

dd if=/dev/hda of=mbr bs=512 count=1

Another thing I do is create memory filesystems known in linux as loopback device files.

/dev/zero is a special file like /dev/null which gives an inexhaustible string of zeroes.

So you can create a file of arbitrary size quickly with

#dd if=/dev/zero of=1mfile count=1024 bs=1024\*1024

And later you can mount it using the loopback mechanism and then create a filesystem on it.,

I have already mailed this before, check the archives.

If you want to create a CD/USB/DVD image file you can use dd.

For instance, my USB flash stick has only 256 MB space. So I do a

# dd if=/dev/zero of=usb-flash bs=1024 count=256\*1024\*1024

Then I 
#losetup -f usb-flash
#mkfs.vfat /dev/loop/0(this cud be different in your case)

After that, I can mount the loopback device just like a USB flash disk. Copy all the files, run grub or syslinux on it and then.

You plug in the USB flash drive and do this.

#dd if=usb-flash of=/dev/sda

You are done. :-)

Or still better send this file to someone else and ask him to make the flash stick for you.

A very sad story indeed. The report says:

<quote>
Hans Reiser  was accused earlier this  year of failing  to pay medical
and child-care expenses...
</quote>

No father - much less a free software developer - would have the heart
to bear that.

Macaulay  had  spoken  strongly  in  favour  of  copyrights  (read  as
"proprietary software" for the purposes of this thread) and the entire
speech is available at :
http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/4/25/1345/03329

The speech was made in the  House of Commons, when an attempt was made
to  increase  the  term of  copyrights  from  20  years from  date  of
publication of the  work to that much time after the  life time of the
author.  The bill was defeated then,  but the law at present is on the
lines  of the  then defeated  bill.  Some  of the  key points  made by
Macaulay in his speech are:

* Copyright is a form of tax - albeit very evil* but a *necessity*.
* Without copyrights,  authors would have to depend  on the government
  or others for support - which would only give room for more evil.

Macaulay  based  his arguments  upon  careful  reasoning and  forcible
examples - nothing much has changed today.

It may be fair and just to  have a clause in the license that *if* the
software is redistributed under any arrangement for money, 10% thereof
should be paid  as royalty to the author(s). ISPs  and others could be
asked to pay the authors and content  providers - it may be just a few
units of money or a fraction thereof per download or distribution, but
given  the volume, it  should yield  enough for  projects worth  it to
survive, keep going and flourish.

The proprietary camp should never be seen to be winning and smiling.

If I were you I would just install dictd server on my local machine or LAN aand use it.

I love the dictionary protocol (rfc2229) since it gives me a simple command line utility called dict that talks over TCP and I just page it, grep it and redirect it to get what I want.

They have some amazing dictionary collections...

It is all free.


And there is dict.aioe.org which actually serves wikipedia pages.

Do a 

$dict rajnikant 

:-)

It also suggests nearby matches in case you mis spell it.

There is also a utility called look in FreeBSD to check the spelling.

But its dictionaries are not perfect. I have not found the word,

    "roistering" though I am able to find roister. Funny!

    That way even wikipedia has lot of gaps and some errors.

Well, I guess this is the best thing to do for you.

If you don't want to run a server, StarDict... More flexible would be
dictd + any client which uses the dict rfc spec... I use the latter
with dictionary-el (Emacs based client). You don't need a net
connection if you run the server on your comp (The dictionary files
are freely available). I switch between using my localhost server when
offline and the one on net when online..

(To List: Anyone knows the best dict server on the net? Anything
outside the list at http://luetzschena-stahmeln.de/dictd/index.php ?
...)

it moves on...

Please dont nitpick on my python, I am a horrible python programmer. 

But this does the job for Windoze folks who want to use dict.

And also for certain braindead linux distros that dont include dict.

Please make sure you copy paste properly as python is sensitive to spaces...

Does Windows ship with Python nowadays? If not, surely it is far
better to do this in .NET or something that Windows natively supports?
A VB macro for Word, perhaps? :)

An interesting feature that I find very useful is the option 'seek',
the command above can instead be used as:
dd if=/dev/zero of=1gfile bs=1024 seek=1024k count=1

This will create a 1 gb file but the actual blocks are not allocated
(you can verify it using stat/du). As the filesystem on this file gets
populated, the necessary space will be allocated.

And one of the more obscure uses of dd is to byteswap while
reading from "if" to "of".  If you ever need to read binary data
written by a big endian machine on a little endian box, you'll
find it usefull.

Typical scenario is when a SUN box writes an entire array/matrix
of ints or floats to disk and you want to read it on a PC.

this whole post is way way OT - what has free software development to  
do with morals? In fact, in the FOSS world it is considered  
irrelevant who you are, what your name is, where you live, whether  
you beat your wife - the only relevant factor is the quality and  
quantity of your commits.

how can using closed tools be better than using open tools?  
Installing python in doze is trivial - and every extra foss tool that  
appears on doze is one more nail in their coffin. I know of people  
running servers on doze - Apache2, mod_python, postgresql,  
firefox ... a fifth column undermining the 'evil empire' from within.

You too, are missing the point kg. Unfortunately, there are far too many 
people who associate themselves with foss for dogmatic/moral/political 
reasons, and seem to miss the whole point, which is having fun sharing 
your work/knowledge (at least in my view).

I'm really saddened when people paint "proprietary" to be the enemy when 
it's putting the food on so many tables here. Some people want to be 
paid for their work, let it be so. Foss and proprietary software both 
have their places. Neither of them are going anywhere. I just hope 
people get on with their lives and stop seeing things in free vs. 
proprietary holy war mindset. With all due respect to everyone 
concerned, grow up, guys.

Well said. Technology is created for Users to use it and not to debate on
them. How many of us worry how the food is made when we take food in Hotels

I don't think that it what Vamsee implies.  I think he just wants to
say distributing/selling/using/making closed source applications is
not evil.

Most of the time they don't expect to get paid for foss. Its your
hobby and for very few people hobby brings money. For the rest of us,
it eats into our earnings, if any. Would you not agree?

In Hyderabad, Microsoft pays (and still has difficulty in finding
enough people to fill their opening, I must add) between Rs. 9-12
lakhs pa for a programmer competent on MFC/.NET and other Microsoft
technologies with around 5-7 years of experience. Show me ONE FOSS
company in any of Hyderabad/Bangalore/Chennai that pays similarly.

I think the Industry seeks to adopt FOSS not for its ethics, it should be
becoz of the Low Cost involved both in developing and maintaing. They get
Operating Systems for free, projects can be started within a Community and
you get developers working on it from various parts of the world FREE. So,
the development work is done with the help of Community.One way, this model
is good,brings out many good points with Community and Team spirit and the
urge to work.

This would sure bring in fame, but what about Money ?. I dont have answer
for this. Usually the business model would go like this - Th Company starts
a project, maintains it for say 1 year as Community Based. At that period,
it plans for Commercial Venture of that product where Community would not be
involved much and releases as the days goes by so that the Company could now
earn profit.

This seems to be a non-ending debate always :)

If there aren't any, then it proves the point that there aren't any
FOSS jobs, leave alone high-paying FOSS jobs.

Exactly. The question is, do you want it to bring in money? I am
talking of hobby, you are talking of business. If you see a potential
revenue in your hobby, it is only pragmatic to reap the revenue. Going
closed at that point in time will in no way be non-ethical.

I am happy that your hobby pays you. It doesnt  for me. I earn

FWIW, the Microsoft starting package for freshers (no experience)
hired from Anna Univ. was 9+ lacs pa.  Google and other companies pay
even more.  I'm sure someone with 5-7 years of experience will be paid
much much more.

I was talking of pay - money, divided by 12, minus TDS and others,
that ends up in your bank account. The package you are talking about -
CTC in HR parlance - is calculated much differently. The salary is
just a component of the CTC.

Still pretty decent!  On an average gross sal is around 50-60% of CTC

if FOSS is a mere hobby - the proprietary camp will win. There will  
be no contest. And that is what 'they' are saying - FOSS is a  
hobbyist toy to play with, not a serious business case for grown up  
people

Indeed. And then there's the ASCII-EBCDIC conversion as well :)

Probably includes ESOPs, perf-linked bonus etc. too. 9l for a fresher
is unbelievable anywhere in India (unless your are from an IIM). :) In
tech, for non-IIT types, I think the norm would be more like 3.6-6
range depending on the company/location.

You can't have it both ways - either these are FOSS companies in
Bangalore/Hyderabad/Chennai and hence ought to pay the kind of money I
mentioned (numbers?) or there aren't any FOSS companies in these
locations.

Again, talking numbers .. Google was paying 12 lacs pa at NIT, Trichy.
 So, the CTC will have to be a pretty small part of it to bring it
down to that level.  But you're right about these numbers being CTC.

Wrong. For most it is a hobby that they don't expect to earn from. If
you see the prospect, nobody stops you from digging gold!

And what is about proprietary people winning? If you want to work
on/with linux and earn from it, the guy who employs you must earn from
it. If I do the same work his company does for free, you will not have
a job! So, the companies will have to go proprietary and protect their
ideas.

Why is this hatred toward proprietary companies? Thats not why this list is!

Well - if its 6l a month (and assuming M$ is skimming the cream of the
university and paying at the higher end of the range) .. that's more or
less 60% of a 9l salary.

Yes, probably does include all the other inflationary tactics that go
into creating an impressive looking CTC while actually giving far less
to the poor sucker who believes that figure .. [a lot of those can be
collected only after a long, long period of service + with strings
attached].  But still a far more decent salary than I've seen at most
places ..

If I did, I ll float a company that will earn me dollars and not be
talking if I Linux is better than windows or not. If you had your own
software that earns you big money, you will always say it is the best
and not share its secrets with others so you can remain in the game.

Philanthropy is not business and business is not about sharing!
Atleast it is so, IMHO

not hatred fro proprietary companies - hatred for the silly idea that  
only way to make money is to be proprietary. What you are saying is  
precisely what uncle bill and co are saying - if foss wins out all  
computer professionals will starve.

Absolutely. This happens in every other field of science. if some
engine maker went about telling everyone why his engines were
powerful, he would not be in business any longer than that!

And it there is a business model by which you can be "open" about your
technology and still make big money --  I am sure the BSchool guys
would have figured it by now!!

So what are these industry standard rates?

As per my understanding, for software development jobs the heirarchy
is something like:

- PHP, ASP, VB etc. pay low. Fact.
- C#, Java etc.
- C++/STL/MFC (sound knowledge) next. PL/SQL and Java buzzwords like
EJB or whatever.
- A degree/masters in CS with niche skills (embedded, graphics/video,
mobile, ...)

Many thanks for correcting me. I too felt uncomfy writing "graphic"

My brain must have been sleeping :-)

Btw, I forgot to mention though I very much wanted to that 
I used dd to actually cut video at arbitray offsets using the skip and seek parameters.

Just think of dd as cat on steriods...

Hmm... Which video format is that? I thought they all had pretty
crucial information at the beginning of the video file that you can't
just dd a bit off the middle and hope to get a snippet of the video.

The truth of the matter is that the vast majority of all programmers make
their money writing propreitary software.

There is a reason sofware companies prefer the propreitary route when it
comes to developing software for their clients. The FOSS method of making
money is to give the software free, but charge for the support/service.
However, IMHO this approach to business only works for:

A - Enterprise software such as ERP products
B - Enterprise Servers
C - Anti-virus products (where regular interaction with the vendor to get
updates/maintenance is critical)
D - Custom developed software (where the software may be so specific to
the customers requirement that it doesn't make sense for them to share the
source code with other customers or where the customer is tied to the
vendor for maintenance)

For most other kinds of software users will try and get by as much as
possible with the limitations of the software if it means that they don't
have to pay for support.

For instance, in all this time that I have used Windows or Linux, I
haven't had to pay for support even once. Neither have I paid for JBOSS,
PostgreSQL, MySQL etc. It is not that I haven't had problems with these
software, but it is because I was either able to get around the problem
with some effort, or got someone to help me out without having to pay the
vendor.

The millions of copies of pirated software floating around even though the
vendors will not support them is a testament to the fact that once a
software is released, most people won't ever go back to the vendor of the
software for support.

I do believe that there is a definite business case for using FOSS
software especially for enterprise-level software, software for
governments, any custom developed software etc because you don't want to
tie yourself down to a vendor, however, if your business is not entirely
dependent on the software (that is, you can replace it with a equivalent
software without affecting your business), then you can afford to be be
neutral in your decision about using propreitary or FOSS software and then
price, features and user friendliness become the most important issues and
not the FOSS/propreitary nature of the software.

This decision neutrality makes it possible for vendors to choose the
approach which most often financially benefits them more - which is to
develop propreitary software.

So no, I don't think either FOSS or propreitary are winning this battle.

Thanks,
PK

Actually the anecdote goes like this. 

I wrote this program around a year ago when I was younger and brasher to quote Roshan Mathews. ;-)

Roshan,
       	I simply love that term. And I wish to thank you a million times for it.  :-)

And guess what? I wanted the whole world to know it. As if I had conquered an empire or something. I shoot off a mail to my contacts(nearly all of them use windoze) giving them instructions on how to download , install and add python to their path environ variable.

And asked them to use my program.

If my guess is right, not even one of them tried my advice.

And much longer before I setup a LAN at my workplace to dish out dict meanings and had just learnt procmail then. So I remembered the familiar advice of stringing together powerful UNIX tools.

So I created a rule for people to send me e-mails with subject "find capricious" and then fetchmail would download the e-mail, procmail would pattern match against the find keyword, and invoke the dict executable.

In this example of course, it would reply with the meaning of "capricious."

Dict would talk to the dict server I setup in LAN for the meaning, once I get back, I simply populate the reply buffer with the meaning and reply.

All this is done by procmail with formail helper.

And I used to be a devil even in those days. I quietly archived away their original e-mails in a folder. So I would know who actually sent mails.

And I did it with my canonical mail ID. It was amusing to sometimes find that ppl would mistype and I would get that mail in my inbox. But overall it was fun and somewhat interesting.

All this used to happen in seconds of course.

And ppl used to think that I had done something big. 

It is very funny how non technical ppl think.

Actually I learnt an important lesson. E-mail is the most user friendly and familiar tool for any Tom,Dick and Harry. So if you can provide a service thro' e-mail you can convince your grandma to use it. :-)

regards,
Girish
PS:- Interestingly OpenBSD does not ship with a dict client. It has something called edict which is lesser in power. So I added my dict exe to path yday. So I actually ended up adding a dict client to OpenBSD thanx to u folks. :-)

Quite frankly I am here with the following goals.

 a) First and foremost have fun! ;-) But of course
 b) Learn
 c) Share my knowledge
 d) Develop contacts and friendship

 Are my goals any different from the rest of you? I guess not.

 I think we are putting too many rules here, it spoils all the fun.

 It is like saying that in front of your parents, you should not talk this or that. After all they are your parents and they understand you. 

 Just be natural.

 I find it very very hard to convince people that being natural is not wrong as long as you are not infringing on someone else's personal space.

 I think in my very limited experience at ILUGC, the fun factor is not quite  there.

 You folks are way too serious for my taste. But it is ok. 

 I love you and that is what matters.

Strawman argument. I never implied you can't make money with foss. As 
the market says, there is place for both. There are businesses which are 
doing both at a time - and surviving. That doesn't make them evil. They 
are applicable in their respective contexts, and they will both continue 
to be relevant for quite some time to come.

I was just lamenting on the blanket statements like 'proprietary is 
evil'  which I think (and many seem to agree) is misleading, and leads 
to the 'us/them' mindset which is harmful, frankly pointless and it's 
not how the real world works. There are smart people on both camps, and 
most people don't even care. We get much more work done have more fun if 
we can just learn to co-operate and use what makes most sense in that 
context.

You are right. You need to cut at a frame boundary. But mplayer had no trouble playing it. 

I actually abandoned the project. But I just wanted to point out that dd is quite upto the task doing a better job than split.

It was an mpeg video dumped from my TV card.

	NP, I appreciate your openness and willingness to articulate yourself.

	I want more and more ppl coming out of the closet and speaking out rather than lurking...

	But in such situations we should focus on what is right rather than who is right.

	Then everything will be smooth. :-)

I remember doing it on an mp3 file, is it possible to do it on a video file?

It depends on the Objective of the Product/Company. Not that if its web
oriented, it should be only FOSS. There are areas where ASP.NET,SQL Server
works well for many of the companies and PHP,MY-SQL also work for many
companies.For the sake that someone like FOSS or its ethics, choosing FOSS
is stupid. A detailed analysis should be done whether the Technology what is
being taken favours their business and most importantly CUSTOMERS. In this
regard, FOSS has to come up. It is indeed a good sign that FOSS is being
used by many small companies. It requires its own time to get stabilized.

However, if its Microsoft, .NET rules !

There isnt much of a difference. Both adhere to mpeg standards.

In a video you typically have 25 frames a second if it is PAL. In mp3, it is 38 frames per second.

It is possible to do it and get away. But audio/video engineers would frown at you. 

It is not a clean way of doing it but it can be done.

I was waiting for this partcular statement all these days. :-)

You can completely open up and still win. 

I know Edison was very shrewd and patented all his inventions.

But I firmly believe in openness. It is against the grain of my personality to keep something to myself...

I plan to make my life an example of how to share one's knowledge to make the world a better place.

So far I have succeeded. But I am not forcing anyone to agree with me.

Just my point of view, that is all.

But could Yahoo still afford to pay so much if they release the source code
of every tool they write! They have to necessarily hold back certain things
which have strategic value.

They use freebsd, qmail - various other stuff that starts off as open
source.  But the modifications they use would most likely be useful only
to them [and they have contributed back a lot of patches etc to the oss
versions of the software they use].  And the stuff they use would only
be useful at the sort of extra high loads they put on it.

I am sure it is less difficult than finding the connection between logarithms, 
compound interest, golden rectangle, google, knuth's metafont and all that has 
with computers and free software !

Here is a snippet from an interview, and
the connection you would like to see:

<quote>
Jeremy Andrews: How important is the GPL
to you? Do you have any interest or
intention of working on a filesystem for
any of the BSD operating systems, or for
any closed source operating systems?

Hans Reiser: Doing GPL work is doing
charity work in our current legal and
economic framework. That should be and
could be changed, but for now it is so.
I have done my share of charity, and I
would not have a problem doing
proprietary work. I think people should
keep their lives in balance, and that
includes balancing charity work and
better paid work. That said, I have no
tempting offers at the moment, so I will
probably keep on doing GPL work for now.
It is not an easy life, I am $200k or
more in debt and drive a 1989 CRX Si. I
do want to finish my naming system project.

As for BSD licenses, I am not that
generous. If other people want to charge
for my code, they should give me some
too. I do offer licenses in addition to
the GPL for a fee.

</quote>

The request of Hans Reiser appears to
be a very reasonable one.  The GPLv3 draft is being
discussed, and there is no harm in
inviting attention to this problem, so
that it is fixed and free software
developers can live a little more
comfortably and honourably.

Royalty - not license fees - could help to keep the software free, and at the 
same time provide the much needed support for free software developers.

I have forwarded a copy of my previous post to a list that is read by RMS.  I do 
hope the GPLv3 makes room for such a clause.

The problem is not one specific to just Reiser.  This year might as well be the 
year of wisdom for the free software community.

Recently:
- FreeBSD came up with a trademark policy.  See 
http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/documents/Guidelines.shtml
- GPLv3 draft had clauses allowing addition of terms and conditions based on 
trademarks.
- For sometome now, Linus Torvalds has been making claims that "Linux" is a 
trademark and demanding that people using "Linux" pay a license fee.

What appeared to be originally free is slowly and gradually turning non-free and 
could easily become just the usual dull and boring bait and switch variety of 
the usual "free" products available in a market place.  Rather than collecting 
any license fees indirectly or imposing terms and conditions with trademarks as 
an excuse, it would be more straight forward and much simpler to have conditions 
for payment of royalty to the authors.

>From Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Mark_Institute>,


*The Linux Mark Institute (LMI) is an organization which administers the
"Linux" **trademark* <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark>* on behalf of
**Linus Torvalds* <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds>* for
computer **software* <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software>* which includes
the **Linux kernel* <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel>*, computer
hardware utilizing Linux-based software, and for services associated with
the implementation and documentation of Linux-based products.*

*The Linux trademark is owned by Linus Torvalds in the U.S., Germany, the
European Community, and Japan. In the U.S., the mark is registered (U.S Reg.
No.: 1916230) for "Computer operating system software to facilitate computer
use and operation." The assignment of the trademark to Torvalds occurred
after an attorney, one William R. Della Croce, Jr, in
**1996*<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996>
* began sending letters to various Linux distributors claiming to own the
Linux trademark and demanding royalties. The distributors rapidly pooled
resources, appealed against the original trademark assignment and had it
reassigned to Linus Torvalds.*
And the Official Link - The Linux Mark Institute <http://www.linuxmark.org/>

Here is clear explanation from the site -


*Examples of Fair Use.
If you are a journalist interested in writing articles that include the term
"Linux," you do not need a sublicense.** If you are printing up pencils,
stenciling T-shirts, or distributing coffee cups with a legend on them like
"Linux(r)is the greatest!" or "Even my Mother uses Linux(r)!" this is normally
considered "fair use".
*

*Trademarks:  Use Requiring A Sublicense.
On the other hand, if you plan to market a Linux - based product or service
to the public using a trademark that includes the element "Linux," such as
"Super Dooper Linux" or "Real Time Linux Consultants" you are required to
apply for and obtain a low-cost sublicense from LMI. This is true whether or
not you apply to register your trademark with a government.

I am a simple man who loves simplicity. To quote Einstein,

  " Everything should be kept simple, no simpler."

  There is a lot of wisdom in the few words coming from one of the foremost thinkers of the last century.

  IOW, solutions should be simple and not simplistic.

  Coming to the point, I find GPL horribly complicated, I wonder if even RMS understands it properly. :-)

  OTOH however BSD license is so simple. 

  Now, I like to be practical too.

  Companies flout GPL left, right and center. (Sorry for this Indian English :-)

	If you want to know which company in Chennai does that I will tell you in private. :-)

	And there are many more around the world. Compare this to piracy.

	So laying down laws are not the solution.

This is like the practice followed in Tamil Nadu engg colleges to keep boys from not interacting with girls. Does it help? No, it only hurts.

Or, rather let me put it this way to avoid hurting the academicians in the list. Maybe it helps, but you overdo it. 

Lawmakers should be practical and be pragmatic in their approach.

They should know what will work and what will not work.

For me from purely the perspectives of simplicity and practicality, BSD license appears more attractive...

Of course, I am the last guy to be talking about these things but well...

Well, I am sure you meant it on a lighter note as the wikipedia article shows only incidental relationships between math and the real world.

But I am increasingly getting convinced as time passes by that no hacker/inventor is complete until he learns both hardware and mathematics.

Let me give you a few examples. 

Ethernet CSMA/CD has exponential backoff and TCP bandwidth computation, NTP's time correction algos are all filled with real world math.

Very simple, but math all the same.

Google is coined from googol, 10^100 (a lighter note).

And spam combating algos use Bayesian probability theory and Markovian chains.. (Wait for the tech talk by me  to learn more :-)

So does Poisson distribution in provisioning telecom equipment and switches.

The cellular phone network gets its name called cell from the octagonal structure assigned to users in a particular "channel." 

Now, the electromagnetic waves from an omnidirectional antenna have  a spherical wavefront and consequently one would expect circles to mark channels instead of hexagons.

Then why did cellular telephony come up with hexagons? 

It is bcoz circles don't tessellate;, i.e., there would be gaps if you arrange multiple circles close to one another. You could go in for squares or triangles that tessellate well but then hand over would not work properly bcoz it does not properly represent electromagnetic propagation models from an omndirectional base station antenna...


Now, coming to hardware.

It is not only assembly programmers but also driver writers and systems C programmers need to know hardware fundas.

Today our cellphones have so much software built into them that their complexity is mind boggling.

And nearly every toy/mechanical device is software controlled these days. Right from control systems in nuclear reactors to power stations to simple garbage recycling plants..

Everywhere you have embedded systems doing their work in software.

Since hardware once designed experience little change over time.

Whereas software is constantly evolving. And software designers should be as  aware of the underlying hardware as hardware designers should be of the kind of software that it should support.

Let us talk of DSP for media processing. It is all math and hardware. And everything is actually software technically.

Enjoy!

No. That link doesnt answer it. Linus personally doesnt get any money 
from the trademark license. It goes towards enforcing the trademark to 
the LMI. If you dont enforce the trademark you lose it and "Linux" as a 
name has been abused before which is what LMI is trying to prevent.

Its simple, I agree with it.
Take linux it is  surviving because of its GPL license with copy left
feature, unlike *BSD many part of code are taken by properitary companies,
and has become proprietary.

I think the subject says it all.

What are the issues? Anyone working on it?

Does gtalk use SIP or some other proprietary implementation?

I think it uses libjingle for traversing NAT firewalls.

If you know any tool that already does that, it will be great.

Thanks.

For the benefit of lazy bums like me can u please share your package or source?

Your blog is too lengthy for me to follow.

Or give a dumbed down set of instructions?

Anyway happy to hear that it works on linux.

Btw, how do you talk to someone alongside listening to music?

:)

This is what i vaguely remember to be the steps I did to get it
working...Might miss one or two points..

(main source was http://psi-im.org/wiki/Jingle_branch )

1) Download the psi-jingle source from
http://biotech.iitm.ac.in/~bt04b015/psi-jingle.tar.bz2 =>taken from darcs on
Feb 26..Anyway, as far as i remember, development on this stopped after
december 2005...so taking afresh from darcs shouldnt make a difference)

2) Install the pre-requisites as mentioned on the wiki page... (
http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/linphone/ortp/sources/ortp-0.7.1.tar.gz,
http://downloads.us.xiph.org/releases/speex/speex-1.1.11.1.tar.gz =>use only
these versions..later versions have come but dont use them)

3) do the normal 3 step install (configure, make, make install)...remember
to enable jingle during configure... ie., ./configure --enable-jingle...i
dont understand why its disabled by default :-/)

4) takes a terrible lot of time to compile...wait wait wait..drink 3 cups of
coffee maybe

5) once done (hopefully without any errors), run ldconfig as root to update
the ld cache (is that the right terminology?)

6) go ahead and run psi... type psi in console..it should work fine :)
setup your gtalk account as per
http://psi-im.org/wiki/Google_Talk_HowTo..once signed in, you should
see a voice call item in the right click menu
for any of your contacts..

and
<quote>

> Btw, how do you talk to someone alongside listening to music?


</quote>

as i said, in my earlier mail, "got bored of having an imporper sound daemon
which dint let me talk if xmms/mplayer was playing (which is pretty much all
the time" and as a result, forgot it once and for all...prefer typing any
day :)

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0610121144y4ee58d72gd037d103a8a48149@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

I installed ubuntu dapper in my system.
connected to net and updated all my required stuff.

I have ubuntu dapper systems in my friends home, where there is no internet.

So, i have to copy all my updated packages to that system.
While updating in synaptec, i choosed not to delete the packages.

so, in my system somewhere all the downloaded packages are there.

Where are they?
How do create an ubuntu update cd using thses packs.

i want to create a ubuntu package cd so that i can add in in source
list as a extra media.

this is to avoid manually installing each packages in other system.

help me.

thanks,
T.Shrinivasan.

It can be found in /var/cache/apt/archives/. But usually it would have got
deleted... If it there in your case, then take the whole and install it on
your friend's machine.

How do create an ubuntu update cd using thses packs.


Already there are similar initiative going..

unless you did an "apt-get clean" all the downloaded packages will be
available in: /var/cache/apt/archives/

> How do create an ubuntu update cd using thses packs.
Generate the index of the available packages :
cd  /var/cache/apt/archives/
dpkg-scanpackages . /dev/null > Packages

Now, add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list and do an 'apt-get update'
deb file:/var/cache/apt/archives ./

This is not the way how packages are generally stored on CDs and
ofcourse you should customize it to your needs.

i didnt want to say this before, but i think there is a deliberate  
attempt here, by giving links and making half true statements, to  
make people think that Linus is doing something underhand. Hence  
words like 'linus is demanding royalties' and 'a case is going on in  
australia'.

how do you say it has become proprietary? Arent those parts still  
used by BSD? Or is BSD prevented from using them? I listened to Eben  
Moglen the other day and he said something like this: If i have money  
and you dont, and i give you money, then you have money and i dont.  
If I have knowledge and you dont, and i give you knowledge, we both  
have knowledge. Or, if i have source code and you dont, and i give  
you my source code, then we both have source code, [even if you hide  
yours from the world.] The part in square brackets is my own addition.

As far as i can see, *BSD is surviving also, as are postgresql, sqlite 
(public domain), apache, subversion, zope, plone, python, php and  
thousands of other packages, in spite of the fact that they have bsd- 
style licenses.

Am afraid this accusation is true. I had known about the Australian trouble
but when I read the post accusing Linus of demanding royalties I thought
this is 'news' to me. Now I know it is no more new than the australian
incident. Looks like it is a (wilful?) misinterpretation.

Is this because Linus has rubbished GPLv3? Going through the original
accusation again, I get this feeling!!

Hi Luggies,
   Can anyone suggest me a good multimeter (DMM). What are the
features to be required in it? Where can I get it in Chennai? What
brand? What is its cost?

I want to buy it this week. I may be using it for my electronic
hobbies, projects, networking & for other general purpose. Pls.
suggest me.

Go to a few electronic shops and enquire. Lab assistants might be also a 
good option to enquire about. Or, are you looking for a FOSS MultiMeter 
? ;) (bah, when people have asked me about FOSS HTML, can't there be 
FOSS MultiMeter :D )

Thought of just watching around, but couldn't any more. Can we conclude 
on what this Mailing List considers as an *OT* and what all other things 
which can be considered as "Topics of Interests" in this Mailing list.
Let it not be flames this time, hope each one can just put down what 
their opinion is and at last we chalk it out, after hearing from 
everyone (mean the active participants).

I am sorry. But there is one consistent mistake doing the rounds in
this list. Don't give one specific case to prove a point. You need a
general case. Exceptions prove the rule. I want to know how many
"collabnets" are there in the industry? You can handpick them. How
many closed source companies are there? Can we take a quick statistic
to compare them? Are they comparable at all??

Like somebody else pointed out, if you do business out of FOSS, you
have to depend on post-sale support. How many people are going to need
one? Too many vendors can offer that support for that many people? And
most lugs can provide similar support for most of the issues in their
mailing list.

Well, I don't believe this topic is taking me anywhere. Those are my
beliefs and I dont want to question them. I will never want you to
question your beliefs either. So, don't bother replying this one. And
am extremely sorry if I hurt any of the readers sentiments.

I have been using a UNI-T multimeter (which shows a model no. of
DT830B) and has hold good for all my hobby needs. You can even
test a transistors and diodes on it. These models are in abundance
in Ritchie St. and would be the default one  you would be presented
with. They are a good student companion. Google will give you the
images.

Bought from Ritchie St. for I believe Rs. 180 3 years ago. Better
models exist and are costlier.

Go Exploring Ritchie St. !

just if a simple  multimeter can cause flames in the group,  then how 
come will the discussion about healthy topics ......
would there me any chance of discussing some thing useful other than 
arrest cases like that ...
i still remember that this group was discussing about kernel parameters 
and those FOSS oriented stuff ...
where are those discussion ...
but for now it had become like a Tea -Shop  bench .....

sorry if i hurted anybody

first thing understand that the FOSS business model is the new  
upcoming business model. Obviously the old proprietory business model  
dominates. Secondly i only quoted one instance because you are  
obviously uninterested in doing any research of your own in this  
subject - there are any number of instances - infrae, mysql,  
edgewall, mahiti, deeproot, srijan, sql-ledger, katipo, operational  
dynamics, collabnet, canonical, redhat, novell, ibm ... you want more?

again check infrae, mysql, edgewall, mahiti, deeproot, srijan, sql-

novell, ibm ... you want more?

you will never get anywhere unless you are constantly questioning  
your beliefs and reassessing them in the light of experience - and  
being openminded in assessing criticism of your beliefs by others

Hey, btw, I am just off to Richie street to buy soldering iron and few components including multimeter. This mail came exactly on time.

Anand Saha,

      What sort of hardware projects do you do? If you can share it openly well and good. If not please get in touch with me personally.

      I am dying of thirst to do hardware hacking...

I think it was decided loudly and clearly that discussing free and open source stuff like BSD is very much on topic here.

And also that it is very much appropriate to discuss hardware here.

I have already made it clear that hardware discussions are very essential to understand technology and software. So I beg of you everyone to please permit technical discussions of any kind.

You are even free to discuss science here, no problem.

As long as we are learning something new it is good. Period.

Just don't lay down rules.

We are not children.

Don't agree. Perhaps I am a diehard optimist. :-)

The recent mail sent by Ganesh on google talk is so wonderful. There are very many of you smart hackers out there. And everyone is learning and having fun.

What is wrong if some discussions are non technical?

This happens quite often even in corporate environments and even amongst CEOs and CTOs. Nothing wrong.

Lesser the rules, the better.

As long as things don't go down to the level of personal attacks, anything should be acceptable.

My humble opinion(s). :-)

Girish

I use the Mastech M-830BZ mini digital multimeter
which I bought in Ritchie street. Actually, it is the
street perpendicular to Ritchie street, not sure of
the name. I think the shop name is Texonic
Instruments.

This depends on your hardware. The Mastech is a very
basic model and serves my needs.

Yes, I use it for FLOSS embedded projects.

Less than Rs.300.

in the 1st day. That covered our base costs for Futurex. We printed

Well, just putting up a list of companies is of course not enough. Are
these companies making their shareholders any money or running at
massive losses? Of course we can't say anything about the non-public
companies in that list, so let us ask the alternative question, are
any of the above companies public?

The last three are, and:

IBM - FOSS is only a (small?) part of their business. Consulting is
their biggest revenue earner, followed by hardware. Massive, blue chip
company.

Redhat - seems to be doing well (has a P/E of 57, and double the
market cap of Novell). If I might say so, an outstanding success of a
FOSS-based business plan (probably the only one).

Novell - FOSS is big for them, but acquired. Have other products too,
but none with any chance of survival (Groupwise has all but been
killed by Exchange).

Anyone knows if any of the other companies above are public so that we
can see for ourselves whether they are successful FOSS-based
businesses?

Proprietory in the sense, Fixes made by them(proprietory company) arent
going to be ported . I agree that *BSD evolves but  not like Linux , Im
talking in terms of license.

i personaly know katipo, sql-ledger, mahiti, deeproot - none public  
companies, all small, but their owners and employees are not starving  
or killing their wives. I know several srijan employees who are being  
paid over 40K per month - and its a small company. Spikesource is run  
by our very own Murugan Pal - new startup, yet to make revenue.  
Collabnet, canonical and operational dynamics should be  public. Dont  
know whether canonical is making money - they are certainly spending it!

Well, the fact that a given company is spending money does not
necessarily mean they are earning it in the first place.

Thank You, for all that time. I am not interested in researching this
topic because I dont expect it to feed me. And on the other hand, why
is MySQL maintaining dual licensing while PGSQL is not? Why both are
FOSS business models right?

And i cannot understand why IBM figures in this list? They have a much
bigger and broader business interests in varied fields that we cannot
even discuss here. And some of their premium products are not even
close to opensource. They have good support for opensource products.
Isnt that all?

So, if some part of Vista could work exceptionally well in a Linux
network will they feature in this list too?

My point was that lugs can sort issues that support aims to. Can we not?

Precisely. One thing I ve agreed in the entire chain of mails. But,
the questioning will happen when there is a proven model in view. When
I learnt about python, it was almost stable. In the sense that you
could reliably do something on it. But when i did ruby, unfortunately,
the case wasnt the same. Their module for mysql had to change and my
code wouldnt work. I dont use ruby yet?! So, what should I be
questioning? Let the FOSS business model stabilize as a pure FOSS
model that wont need to go proprietary and I will reply you in the
affirmative.

Oh yes. And by saying that YOU didn't care, you have effectively ruled

you can - but no big company needing mission critical support is  
going to depend on lug support. They pay top $ for it. Which is why i  
keep harping on collabnet. All they do is host and support  
subversion. I can do it. You can do it. A lug can do it. But look at  
the companies that pay them

if a proven model is there, where is the need for questioning? You  
cannot make money in business without innovating and taking risks.  
The only people who make money in business are people who do *one*  
particular thing better than anyone else.

no - if i was writing code for a business, i would go the BSD way. if  
i was writing to contribute to or contribute back to the community i  
would go the GPL way. If i was using other's modules, again,  
depending on what i want to do, i would choose modules with the  
appropriate license. I have learnt a lot by seeing how mysql has  
messed themselves up by trying to ride two horses going in different  
directions with dual licensing based on GPL.

Are they going to pin on it? They will sell, for sure. Will they sell
only that? If I had a hardware industry that was bringing me millions,
I will not mind setting up a division for the cause of opensource, and
maybe not sell too.

You said it. No big investor will yet depend on it. Because, there is
no model in sight. ROI is not defined very well.

+1 again. If I innovate and make business out of it, Id want to see
some money atleast for sometime. The only way I can do that is trying
to monopolise it. It is as simple as this.
> The only people who make money in business are people who do *one*

Then why do they have competition at all? Oracle sells database, so
does microsoft and so does IBM and MySQL. And still not all users have
all the databases.  Well, I certainly dont want to pull this any
longer. It benefits none and is flooding the inbox for so many others.

You may write to rms@gnu.org about any GPL violation you know of, if it relates
to GNU software maintained by FSF, or otherwise to the respective owners of the

Software companies seem to be earning well - in fact they are the ones pushing
and keeping the SENSEX up :)

Business Today, May 21, 2006, carried a very interesting story about the plans
of TCS, Infosys and Wipro to make $10 Billion (~Rs. 45,000 Crores) in annual
revenues by 2010 and the article was mostly an analysis on who would make it
there _first_  Some of the key facts given were:
--------------------------------+----------+----------+----------+
The numbers of the big three:   | TCS      | Infosys  |  Wipro   |

Revenues (Cr)                     13,252      9,521      10,625

Number of Employees               66,480     52,715      59,965

--------------------------------+----------+----------+----------+

There is no much information about the extent to which the top companies use or
support free software.  If they do use free software, and some day do give 10%
royalty to free software developers, it could give a big boost to the free
software movement in India.  Also, if the companies adopt the GPL or other free
software licenses which may include a royalty clause I have been suggesting
here, they could also earn 10% royalty from other distributors.

It probably least matters for the companies, so far as their revenues are
concerned, whether the software "technology" used by them is free or non-free.
No matter what, it is likely to remain a constant - if they use free software,
they could probably pass on the benefit in cost savings to their customers.

Any cash flow through the hands of free software developers should be welcome.
A license that gives no scope or room for it may not attract the attention of
the big businesses here.  I would finish saying, an arrangement for payment of
royalty to free software developers would be in the interest of both small and
big entities, and the best way to encourage authors and their projects.

Folks,

Dr Richard M Stallman, Founder and President of the Free Software Foundation,
would be visiting India next week on a visit to Darmashala, and would be
stopping at Bangalore, New Delhi and a few other places.  I am not sure if the
events at Bangalore are finalised, but if anyone is interested in organising any
event there to discuss issues connected with free software in his presence, do
write to rms@gnu.org  I am sure he would love to meet the software developers at
Bangalore.

IIRC the big 3 viz TCS, Infosys and Wipro (among others) wanted software
patents in India!  I dont think they said so publicly but I remember reading
something to this effect in the newspapers just before the s/w patents bill
got shot down by the communists. I could be wrong and maybe they have
changed their stance!

Only listed, public, proprietary-software companies :) I was talking
about the non-public companies listed in the thread.

Why did they skip Satyam? It is the fourth IT stock in the sensex
(apart from these three, that is).

afaik infosys and wipro dont write software - they write code for  
hire. I read somewhere that only 2% of infosys work is actualy  
software. So what exactly are they going to patent?

I remember reading that the entire ICICI Bank IT infrastructure is
"powered" by Infosys-written software. Their online banking, their
ATMs, their portals for share trading, insurance etc., their back
office, databases, warehouses, disaster recovery - everything is done
by Infosys. The way it was projected, it sure sounded like a symbiotic
relationship to me then.

The big four are probably less about writing software and more about
"system integration".

you might say 'solution providers' than 'product developers', which most
company in India are all about (you name any technology under the sun
and they would proovide you with a solution) ....

And i was under an impression that 3i Infotech (formely ICICI
Infotech) was setup just for taking care of ICICI Bank's infotech

	 Justifying Statistical Filtering
	 (and Open Source Technology)

	Jonathan A. Zdziarski
	jonathan@nuclearelephant.com

	June 2005

	Two types of people are likely to read this. The first is systems administrators and the second are executive managers. Most systems administrators are smart fellowes. They're prone to have a solid understanding of statistical filtering and its value, and are usually the last people you have to evangelise about its benefits. Executive management can go either way. You might be a smart manager, trying to put a proposal and case study together for deploying a form of statistical filtering (Bayesian, Markovian, etc) or you may be silently Googling around after feeling really stupid about the current solution you've implemented (against everybody's recommendation). In either case, this article is designed to provide a wake-up call to anyone running a commercial solution (or even thinking about it), and will hopefully explain why statistical solutions are a wiser decision.

	I don't cover a whole lot of technical detail here, but I do think it's necessary to at least define a statistical solution in contrast to the heuristic last-gen solutions. Statistical solutions represent the latest generation of spam filter. They have some inherent AI (Artificial Intelligence) qualities that make them particularly good at what they do. This family of filters includes the now-popular Bayesian filters (pronounced "bay zee in") as well as other filters using statistical analysis to filter spam (such as Markovian classifier CRM114 and Chi-Square Bogofilter). In a nutshell, statistical filters are very different from other filters because they actually read email (well, sort of)...

	Statistical Filters in a Nutshell

	When a statical filter receives an email, it first breaks the message down into tiny little pieces (called tokens). These can consist of words, word pairs, short phrases, or even just a letter or two. How it does this is really up to the filter author. Once the message is broken up into tokens, the disposition of each token is examined. Historically, if the word 'Viagra' showed up in spam most of the time, then that token will stick out as a guilty marker. Likewise, if the word 'eBay' has been seen primarily in legitimate messages, it will become a good marker of innocent mail (ham). There is a specific "probability" that determines the final value of the marker. For example, if the word 'pizza' has shown up in spam exactly as often as in legitimate mail, then the word 'pizza' has a 50% chance of being spam (or not spam). The filter crunches these numbers and can determine whether or not it believes the message is spam by calculating a statistical probability. For example, if the message has a 92% likelihood of being spam, then a Bayesian filter will indeed mark such a message as spam.

	92% is a lot easier to understand for most of us than a score of 3.72. Most people haven't really got any idea what 3.72 means, including the filter authors. So not only do statistical filters rely primarily on mathematics to filter spam, but they also speak the same language most of us do.

	Technical Excellence

	This class of filters are commonly hailed for their extremely high levels of accuracy. Why are they so accurate you ask? Well for one, they are analyzing each user's email individually, so they're able to adapt to whatever email behavior the user specifically exhibits. If the user is into online shopping, the filter will be less likely to make the mistake of marking some of their legitimate shopping mail as spam. Another reason they're so accurate is because they learn and adapt very quickly when they make a mistake, and can conform themselves to users like a glove. If the filter makes a mistake, it begins to (with temperament) adjust its internal clockwork so that it won't make the same mistake in the future (this is what makes the filter learn).

	In contrast, the "other" type of well known filters are called heuristic filters. Instead of making their own decisions about what spam is, they rely on a programmer to write a set of detection rules. Just like most popular virus scanners today, their "spam definitions" come to be out of date very quickly, as spam evolves. Because heuristic filters have no learning mechanism, they rely on frequent updates. Another reason heuristic filters are so terrible at what they do is because these rules are written for the entire world to use - and the entire world gets a whole lot of different email. If your email doesn't fit into what the programmer considers "the norm", you're likely to have a bunch of mail erroneously marked as spam.

	SpamAssassin, for example, was (and still is for the most part) one of these types of filters, however they've recently added a statistical "component" to the filter. So now it's not a heuristic filter and it's not a statistical filter - it's more like a gas/electric hybrid. If you're one of the 27 people who drive a gas/electric hybrid, you probably realize it's not particularly powerful. This also represents how most appliances are built today - several layers of heuristic tests and then stick a Bayesian element in at the bottom. Hybrid filters don't seem to be quite as powerfil either as they're more of a hodgepodge of tools thrown together than any type of technologically meaningful solution. In fact, due to what I call heuristic programming, any statistical components in the solution can end up acting dumbed down as a result of being told what ham and spam is by lesser-accurate (namely heuristic) parts of the filter. It seems rather asinine to use the less accurate portion of the filter to train the more accurate portion, but that's how most hybrid filters are concocted today. Statistical filters will learn whatever you tell them to, so naturally when they're trained by something dumber than a human, they're going to react dumber than a human. I've talk to many people today using commercial appliances based on either SpamAssassin or some other hybrid model, and it's quite scary to hear that they're still deleting spam out of their inbox by the dozens.

	Statistical filtering has now been mainstream for about three years, but despite its technical excellence, most appliance manufacturers are outfitting their boxes with the older style filters and even though the box is technically "new", this old technology is winding up on many networks. We'll get into that shortly.

	Open-Source Roots

	One of the noteworthy mentions about spam filtering in general, and especially true of statistical filtering is that open source tools really have obtained the upper hand in this venture. Statistical filtering is a technology developed by the open-source community and copied by the commercial industry, which is quite the stumbling block to companies like Microsoft, who have frequently positioned the open-source community to appear as a group of pirates (aargh!) who carbon-copy technology. Not only have our beloved open source solutions proven to provide some of the best results in the industry, but they're also free.

	In spite of this, the Internet is having a huge junk sale on anti-spam products. There are many corporations pushing anti-spam solutions, some that are even claiming to have some creative ownership in spam filtering technology. In fact, hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent every year to purchase appliances that deliver a tenth of the results that the open source community is giving away for free. Some say this is due to support, or the need for rapid deployment, but in reality it's because the majority of commercial appliance manufacturers find statistical filtering so highly accurate that it can do its job without them. Regardless of whether it's Bayesian, Markovian, Chi-Square, or whatever - manufacturers have had to face the decision of either losing money (on nightly energizer updates and the like) or crippling their own filtering solution to require such constant maintenance that consumers will subscribe to all possible services for fear of their filter degenerating - which it will.

	Much to the chagrin of the filter manufacturers, all reasonably written open source statistical filters actually get better with time (and on their own), like a fine wine. Imagine a world where there are no rule sets to update, no whitelists to maintain, and only minor tweaking by a sysadmin occasionally to blow the dust out of the fans. You've just imagined the next generation spam filter. In fact, many of the tests out there showing statistical filtering as superior don't even know the half of it - there's just nothing like a nice seasoned database that's been learning for a year or more. And sadly, this well oiled machine just doesn't fit into the monthly recurring business models of most manufacturers. The best you can hope for in many commercial solutions is a Bayesian "element". This really is more of marketing buzz than anything, however, as you'll find it buried deep below several more "heuristic" layers of analysis - all of which dumb down the true learning potential of any statistical elements in the box.

	The sad truth of the matter is that most people have a knee-jerk reaction to spend money in order to own a pretty box. Depending on the color scheme of the server room, you've got the choice of aqua blue, earth-tone green, or luscious yellow. It sure looks good bolted into that rack in the server room, and the fact that it cost $50,000 gives CEOs bragging rights with equally vendor-conditioned customers. Much like other well-marketed solutions, many of the appliances out there deliver in the board room better than they deliver in the server room. I initially thought that after the first dot-bomb, corporate America would begin to wake up and see through all the marketing glitz poured over what are, for the most part, substandard products. In spite of the new found financial sobriety in most technology companies today, many are still falling victim to make decisions based on buzz rather than actual technical specification. And since customers are sensitive to buzz, it's sometimes better to actually buy a well marketed product than one that performs well. This leads me to one thing I've learned over the past ten years of working startups: many corporate executives aren't really interested in technology as much as image.

	This rant does have a point, and I do want to address some of the many reasons large corporations should be considering open source solutions - especially the many superior open-source solutions that are available for eliminating spam and light years ahead of commercial solutions. I'm by no means against free enterprise - I in fact would love to see a few anti-spam startups get out there and market some truly statistical, adaptive products that have a chance at solving the spam problem (Death2Spam is one such product, I hear). What I do take issue with is that a legitimate company ought to have a viable product. How you define a viable product is open to some creative license, but certainly part of it must mean that it's better than something you can get for free.

	If you're a frustrated employee at a large corporation or Internet service provider and can't get your hands around why others don't get the value of open source, you're not alone. Your managers will probably be hitting you with some questions you may not have even thought about. It seems so obvious to the thinking population why a better functioning open source solution should be preferred over an inferior commercial product, that sometimes we don't even think about the details. The rest of this article is dedicated to explaining why open source solutions especially make sense in the setting of spam filtering.
	Cheap Pickup Lines

	We've been fed some cheap pickup lines, and most of us have fallen for them at one point. But at the end of the day, free kittens and $25 kittens share two things in common: they both meow and poop. The commercial solution might not be justified by that of technical specifications, but ROI (as I said, corporate America isn't interested in technology).

	The rational question for the technologically challenged, and where some of the ammunition resides in justifying open source, is in return on investment. Does filtering have a better return on investment than managing spam? Does a commercial product have a better ROI than an open-source solution? Some of the common questions non-technical leadership will likely have are provided in the next section and will be crucial for pushing some CEOs over the hump of needing an aesthetically pleasing case. We'll also dispel some of the marketing myths and choice pickup lines you'll usually hear from commercial software gigolo's to sell you their product.
	Marketing Pickup Line #1: You need support

	Well yes, you do need support. What you don't need is planned support. The difference is that support involves assistance with reasonably complex tasks while planned support involves making the product more difficult than necessary, to facilitate a support contract.

	Generally speaking, companies that tout support as a "value-add" are doing so because their product has been designed for difficulty in maintenance, so you'll pay them for the ability to pick up the phone on occasion - most likely about a problem they created themselves by designing a poor product. These support contracts provide a good bit of residual income for large corporations by paying annually just to be on "standby". You need support much like you need aerosol spray - it comes in handy sometimes, but if you stop hanging out by the bathroom you won't need it as much. Not only do many companies provide poor support, but they provide it overseas in India - which is where you'll likely be calling when you have a problem.

	In the open-source community, things are very different. The quality of the product is more important than generating a revenue stream from support, as the philosophy under which the project was originally started is likely to be more philanthropic in nature. And since open source projects are started with the expectation that other people will be using them (on a low level), they're usually designed to be understandable by other knowledgeable administrators. Any open-source product worth its time has been both well-written and well-documented to make it fairly easy for a sysadmin to implement and use on their network. If the admin gets stumped, the open-source community supports the growth of two primary areas of support:
	Free Support

	The open source community likes things free. Large community support forums have been home-grown for many open-source projects. This means implementors will be able to receive free support from experts in the field who are using the software hands-on - actual technical people who speak your native language and have actually seen the product they're supporting. In contrast, the commercial world leaves the poor systems administrator having to go through their sales contacts, a sales engineer, and potentially two or three other people before finding the answers they need - all while paying for their time. All the money that was sunk into a commercial support contract will start to seem like an awful lot as they hold the line for overrated support, that will most likely fail to provide any real answers to their problems (judging by the poor quality of customer service in today's technology marketplace). In the time it takes some to reach some technical specialists about products, they could have already had an answer from a community support forum or chatroom.
	Support Contracts

	As the popularity of a project grows, so do the number of people looking to earn a living supporting it. Open source developers have come to realize that corporations require support, and many have acommodated this requirement by providing paid support options. These are sometimes available directly through the spam filter author, or by others closely related to the project. This does several things - it promotes healthy competition among these groups, which helps keep support costs down, and it also means that if you stump your support group with a project, there are many other options available, as opposed to commercial support which lends itself to the cookie-cutter approach. Diverse support also means that there is a stronger likelihood you will find a group specializing in your specific area of interest (such as implementing product X on Solaris with an Oracle backend).
	A Support Monoculture

	Commercial software creates somewhat of a paid support mono culture. All the support you're going to receive generally emanates directly from the software manufacturer or, if they are large enough, from a value-added reseller who has trained their staff with the same learning materials. In other words, if someone can't solve your problem in the commercial world, nobody can. In the open-source world, there's a very diverse set of paid support options available from professional services consultants who specialize in open source, and are all based on different learning experiences.

	There are bright, hard-working individuals in the open source industry who are so hands-on that they can probably solve your problem within a fraction of the time it would take a group of mediocre corporate support specialists. Bugs get fixed quicker, people respond faster, and all this at rock bottom prices. If you're thinking about the need for support, hook up with an open source support provider as you prepare to deploy the project on your network. If the project is any good, you shouldn't need nearly as much support as the marketing executives of the corporate world would have you believe.
	Marketing Pickup Line #2: You need training

	If vendors haven't managed to convince you that open source is a failure because there is "no support", the next thing they'll try to sell you on is that there is "no training" available. Training options in the open source world are very similar to support options. Professional consultants can provide whatever training is needed for whatever projects it is needed for. What's more important to consider when you're talking about such a tool as spam filters is why you need much training in the first place. An anti-spam solution should be simple to use - otherwise your customers won't use it, and you just wasted all your money on a commercial product - with great training and support - that nobody's interested in using. If you have to train "Grandma" how to use your spam solution, you're doing two things wrong. First, you're implementing a solution that's too complex which will not be used by many customers, and more importantly you're kissing any chance of a return on investment goodbye by spending all that extra money to provide technical support to the ones who call in with questions.

	If you work for the average American corporation, you'll find it difficult to capitalize on technical support because customers demand it free. In this case, you're probably already looking for ways to make support less expensive. Your call centers may even be outsourced overseas, or filled with bottom-wage employees who have mastered the art of getting people off the phone without actually helping them. Every dime you spend teaching your users how to use the software is money you would have otherwise saved. If your solution requires a lot of end-user training, it may possibly end up costing more than managing the spam problem in the first place.

	If a software vendor is touting training as a key selling point, this only means their software is so complex that you need training to use it. Next time one of their vendors tries to schmooze you and raises this point, ask them why you need training in the first place, if their product is so easy-to-use. If it's not easy-to-use, why would you want one?

	A majority of open source anti-spam solutions have been designed to be very simple to use, even for Grandma. If a spam makes it past the filter, the user can forward or bounce the message in, click a link, or perform some other trivial task to train the filter. This also provides a sense of participation, which is something a lot of users want in today's world of privacy rights and service control. Not only do most solutions provide an easy-to-use interface like this, but they've been designed flexible enough for systems administrators to implement custom installs. Proprietary systems running IMAP or web-based email can easily be configured with a "Spam Folder" or some other type of device to make managing spam brain-dead easy for the user.
	Marketing Pickup Line #3: You DON'T Need "Training"

	The other extreme in touting training is that you don't need any training; that you can just plug the product in and make it work without the user needing to do anything. Steer very clear from these products - they are not true learning products! In many cases, static "out-of-the-box" products push the responsibility of training to the systems administrator or charge an annual subscription fee to keep the filters updated. Not only does this cost more money, but it provides very poor filtering with a high risk of errors, because all the filtering is centered around what someone else (the systems administrator or the software manufacturer) thinks about a user's mail, rather than what the user thinks about their own mail. If a user can't teach the filter their specific email behavior, the filter won't provide an acceptable level of results for the money. The ability for users to provide feedback into the system is important not only in training the software, but it gives the user a sense of satisfaction that they're able to do something about spam - rather than call the abuse department to complain.

	Installing software on your network that's capable of only 95% filtering accuracy (and provides no feedback mechanism) is going to increase the likelihood that a customer will call in to tech support. Knowing such a system exists on the network will inevitably make users more critical of their inbox. Should they receive a single spam, many less savvy users think the filter isn't working correctly, and will call in to be a "good Samaritan" and let you know that they received a spam - they'll most likely want to forward it to an abuse address somewhere where more network traffic will be generated, and a human will have to respond to it. Add to this the livid customers who call to complain about lost email or false positives - users who are waiting on an important email, and call in because they believe the filter ate it, or find an email erroneously marked as spam that they feel is an inconvenience, and therefore want to make it tech support's inconvenience.

	Lack of a feedback loop does more than hurt accuracy. It costs money. Be very wary of products touting the ability to perform without user participation.
	Marketing Pickup Line #4: Commercial solutions are more scalable

	Some commercial applications are scalable, but more aren't. In most cases, commercial solutions are bloated with non-statistical components that aren't necessary to good filtering. A lot of individuals buy these tools because they don't want to train all of their users' filters - a justifiable need. It's important to realize, however, that there are alternatives to the complete training of a statistical solution such as global seeding, merged groups, and other approaches that provide almost out-of-the-box filtering with little effort. Your mileage may vary in the scalability of open source projects, but there are at least a few whose execution time is measured in hundredths of a second.

	The DSPAM agent runs with a very low execution time between 0.01s to 0.03s for classification and 0.03s to 0.10s for training, actual real time and on average desktop hardware. The CRM114 discriminator is similarly fast in performing between 0.05s and 0.10s execution time for classification. Plenty of open source tools outperform even the most expensive commercial products on the market. Not to say a commercial product isn't capable of performing well, but they are certainly not more scalable than what's freely available. Many open source projects have been deployed on systems with several hundred thousand users - there's no justification to suggest that a commercial application could do any better.

	In fact, when corporations begin to scale to this many users, there is usually a dramatic cost difference between commercial and open-source implementations. Even a scalable commercial implementation will generally cost more to implement in licensing and support contracts than an open-source solution.
	Marketing Pickup Line #5: Commercial solutions are more accurate

	Trust no-one. This is quite the contrary for this specific area of technology. In the setting of spam filtering, a majority of commercial solutions today are advertising levels of accuracy from last-generation filtering - somewhere between 95% - 99%. This means roughly between one and five errors per hundred emails! There are a few that tout five-nines accuracy but many of them are just flat out lying, or require your users to manage whitelists or challenge/response mechanisms. Users of one particular filter making this claim (rhymes with blightmail) have reported filtering rates falling as low as into the mid-80's without whitelisting. Well-written open-source filters have achieved rates of 99.5% to 99.9% and beyond with little effort. This means between one and five errors per thousand emails. That's right, they're more than ten times as accurate as commercial solutions! A few open source filters have even managed to achieve close to five-nines accuracy, with the highest peak recorded at 99.991% using purely statistical methods of filtering.

	The problem with the industry today is that these numbers are getting thrown around enough to confuse unsuspecting managers who flunked math in high school. Is there really a difference between 99% and 99.9%? A big one! (10/1000 spams vs. 1/1000). Unfortunately, people seem to forget how to do math rather quickly when in the presence of a pretty server.

	If you're measuring ROI, accuracy is crucial. Inaccuracy costs a company money. Money translates to bandwidth, server resources and people time to answer complaints or manage spam. And if your filter performs too poorly, filtering itself might be so useless that you still have to delete mail in chunks. There's a significant loss of productivity in the users who have to delete the spam (something that's important if you're paying these people to do something). An error prone solution will cost:

* Money for the initial purchase and installation of the equipment
* The additional bandwidth to cover tens of thousands of extra spams
* The additional server resources to cover tens of thousands of extra messages
* Several hours of total productivity to delete spam
* Loss of productivity for loss of legitimate mail
* Additional salaries paid to cover increasing tech support expenses

								    Think about the total amount of money spent on resources, phone calls, and time and you'll see that the price in paying for an error-prone solution only capable of achieving 99% is really far more than the sticker price. Inaccuracy costs more than accuracy. Solutions are available which cost considerably less to implement and provide higher levels of accuracy, or rather lower levels of inaccuracy.
								    The Death of Old Technology

								    As I mentioned, most commercial anti-spam solution manufacturers are still using the old heuristic approach to filtering in order to generate monthly revenue, and that's unfortunately giving the spam filtering space the image of a snake-oil salesman. Spamming on behalf of anti-spam solutions doesn't help perception either. As these commercial products age, the annual subscription keeps their customers paying for what would otherwise become an entirely useless product. Most companies are willing to pay an annual subscription to maintain the status quo of the technology industry - we all pay support and maintenance. People don't expect anything more because most applications are static and require babysitting.

								    As we move into the world of AI, we've opened up a very dangerous can of worms to this standardized way of doing business - or a very refreshing one. Our AI tools are capable of learning how to improve, and actually do their job better as the software becomes older. The danger to monthly residual is that these tools could sit on a network for five years collecting dust - and still perform better than the latest modelheuristic filters out-of-the-box within a few weeks time. This is something to be very concerned about if you're selling the obsolete technology most manufacturers are selling today, but it's also very comforting for the few who understand the vision behind this AI technology and are forming business models around it.
								    Preventing a Mono-Culture

								    There are a lot of different filtering appliances out there, and this is fortunate in that it helps to prevent a mono culture. That's not to say that any of these companies wouldn't like to be on top. The problem many companies are challenged with, and beginning to encounter, is that because their appliances are fairly static, spammers are becoming some of their customers, and using their machines to test how well their messages will get around the filter. It's pretty easy to change a spam around if you're able to run it through the target filter every time until it finally gets accepted, and with a dumbed-down Bayesian element this is much easier. The adaptive learning provided by true statistical filters is the only solution to this, and makes this practice impossible. It's extremely difficult for a spammer to construct a message that will circumvent a large number of Bayesian filters. This is because each user's filter is based on the user's own personalized behavior. There are plenty of dirty little tricks spammers have tried to use in the past to circumvent filters and they only appear to work on these older heuristic code bases - our adaptive learning filters are seeing right through their tricks. On top of this, open source filters have the added advantage of being successful amidst also being completely exposed. Their full source code available, you can be certain that any spammer who wants to circumvent an open source filter would be looking for loopholes in the code. If any are found, they're quickly discovered and patched. Because open source projects are commonly community-based efforts, they have the advantage of a large-scale, multitalented development group who is motivated by creativity, rather than salary.

								    Advanced algorithms such as Bayesian Noise Reduction make it computationally infeasible to perform many of the more advanced attacks. Spam is ever-changing, and that yearly check sent into the spam filter manufacturer is only a leash. Statistical filtering gets better the more you use it. The biggest fear of these present-day filter manufacturers is the fear that someday it begins to catch on that there are other (free) solutions out there that get better with time. It's easy to see why there are so many companies out there using buzzwords and avoiding statistical filtering - because they lose their leash.
								    Maintenance

								    Finally, maintenance stands the chance of hammering the final nail into the coffin of heuristic filtering. Maintenance between statistical filters and the heuristic filters of yesterday is very different. Heuristic filters demand the attention of the systems administrators or monthly subscription for automatic updates (spam detection rules coming from complete strangers); frequent updates must be installed or transmitted to counter the dynamic nature of spam with new rules. This is ideal if you plan on having a dedicated anti-spam administrator (or a group of them), but most companies don't want to spend an extra hundred thousand dollars on additional employees just to support the so-called "solution" that can't really perform very well on its own anyway. Why have one man doing 100% of the work when you can have all of your customers doing 1/10th of a percent of the work? Not to say that each user must train from scratch, as many statistical tools allow for a global database to start all their users off initially, but forwarding an occasional spam into the system is certainly not what you want to be paying your employees to do. Distributing the responsibility out to the end-user does two things. First, it frees up the staff to work on other projects (nobody wants a dedicated spam guy, especially the guy who's appointed as the dedicated spam guy). It also prevents a total stranger from making decisions about what your filter thinks is spam. Second, it makes each user responsible for their own filtering. Users who don't want to filter themselves merely don't participate. Users who diligently mark spams and correct errors are rewarded with more accurate filtering. This will please the many users who have censorship issues by allowing them to censor themselves. Users want to feel like part of the solution; they have an inner-urge to want to forward the spams they receive somewhere. Why not take advantage of this and allow them to participate. For large implementations where this is not possible, the global database concept works - set up a global database to provide out-of-the-box filtering, and let your users customize the filter's behavior by occasional training.
								    Final Thoughts

								    The consistent fear manufacturers have is that AI makes decisions for people, so that you don't need people in the loop. In reality, AI does make decisions for people, but not the important ones. Why should people have to devote their time to determining if messages are spam? Why should support groups be necessary to answer first-level requests for information? A lot of companies are scared of AI, and with good reason. The companies who are manufacturing tools that don't adapt or help learn how to make decisions will eventually be left by the wayside if they don't change. There will be a time of adaptation to this new technology, but like setting fire to a field, what gets burned away will be replaced with something much better. AI is here to stay, and has been mastered by the open source community.

Open source is about the source code. Not trademark licenses which might 
cover logos too. Requiring a different code base to use a different name 
is explicitly allowed by the OSI definition.

check out the introduction http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php
Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code.....

also to know more about OSS, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software

when u say, any software as FOSS, it means i can do anything with it.

It *does not* cover trademarks. Understanding the basic differences 
between copyright licenses and trademarks would help a lot here.

> when u say, any software as FOSS, it means i can do anything with it.

By that definition, only public domain would be considered FOSS. Clearly 
you cant whatever you want with all Free and open source software licenses.

Mozilla.org is just trying to protect its branding by not allowing any 
arbitrary person to put in his own patches and distributing the same as 
Mozilla.

Would you feel safe to try such a version that might contain phishing or 
any piece of such software?

In first place can you download Debian sources, add in your own patches 
and use your own logo instead of the swirl and redistribute as Debian? 
Obviously not.  That is what Mozilla.org is trying to do.

Mozilla.org does allow you to share and redistribute the sources, if 
you're editing it, better not use their logo and copyright.  IMO this is 
a fair deal.

Hi Friends,

I have developed a simple web based application for our marketing staff
using php & mysql.

I would like to know a hosting company which offers hosting space at a very
economical cost.  I got a quote from a company for Rs.2250/- per year for
100 mb with mysql & php.  Is this price ok?

That's $50 a year, or slightly more than $4 per month. It doesn't
mention the data xfer limit included in the package. All the online
guys seem to charge about $8 for gigabytes of storage and emails and
anywhere between 50-250 GB per month, so I do think your offer is a
bit on the higher side. Hard to conclude without knowing who it is and
what exactly the offer contains (does it contain domain reg? DNS
hosting? etc.)

Did you try... http://www.webcomindia.net/linux-hosting.html
They quote 1,299/- yearly for 100 MB space, 3GB Transfers, inclusive of 
PHP/MySQL support.

I was one of their customers 2 years back. They are based in New Delhi
(but their datacenters are in the US) and are very much economical.
I found their customer support somewhat lacking but I don't have any 
idea about them now. so Caveat Emptor!

I host with dreamhost.com and am very pleased with the results.
You get 200GB storage, 1TB monthly transfer, IMAPS, SMTP-TLS,
Jabber, Subversion, unlimited mysql databases, php/perl and all
the usual stuff.  You also get shell access to their debian
boxes.

If you find a promotion code or someone to recommend you, then
the first year's hosting charges are in the $50 - $80 range.

Note that I don't work for dreamhost, but I'm just a satisfied
and content customer.

Hi,

As I have already posted , i have installed Mandriva 2007. Here are a
few observations.

1.DVD plays out of the box. No need need to install  different
versions ibdvdcss, xine, mplayer etc
2. Mp3 plays out of the box
3.3D Desktop is stunning (Most talked about feature of Mandriva 2007)
 In other versions of Mandriva, Kubuntu, Suse there are some bugs.(In
3D Mode XGL_compiz),
 Video (DVD, TV tuner) doesn't work. Here it works superbly.
 Note: I have ATI Radeon Xpress 200 built in, in Intel 101 Mother Board.

whatever may be, Mandriva (own) package management system is horrible
and not easy to maintain (club membership is costly for any one in
India to go for it).  They should either fall in line with rpm or
debian style.

At KEC, I had the pleasure of meeting Karthic, who works for HP, Bangalore, and 
they have been doing various bench-marking exercises on various free software 
distros.  I could not resist the question, "which is the best fs distro around" 
and to my utter surprise - his answer was "Mandrake".  He said most of the bench 
marking is done using perl scripts and I have taken the liberty of asking him to 
make it to one of the ilugc meets and share his insights when he visits Chennai.


The only "bench marking" I do is to deliberately power off with a few files 
open, and see how the system reacts on boot up.  So far, FreeBSD has been the 
fastest to recover there.

Could you please tell me if it can play 3gp files with sound?

I vote for the 'proprietery is evil' camp.

A business spends on capital investment, salaries & wages and other expenses
(marketing etc) and earns by selling their products

A. How a OSS company can pay developers?

1. When a company starts developing open source software they get an
existing code base FREE. Without that they would be investing big money to
buil the base of their software.
2. Now, the company can afford to give away modifications since their
initial investment is low compared to a closed source company.
3. The exact numbers can be debated, but overall the salaries reaching the
developers should be more or less similar in both the cases.

A business failing or being successful depends on many other factors than
whether their model is closed source or open source.

B. Then,  why OSS model is better?
With OSS model we are not reinventing the wheel. By openly sharing already
developed ideas and codebase we free up resources for improvements. This
benefits everyone.

C. What will happen if every business works on OSS? No software will be
developed?

The model will be everyone working on their part of code which interests
them most and take from others as needed. Money will be made by SELLING
packaged software with your logo (you can do it under GPL) and providing
support, customization, user training etc.

Today the resources of the industry are wasted on repeated efforts on the
same work.

D. Why there are success stories of OSS businesses as closed source has,
like Microsoft etc?

Open Source model by its nature can not and will not produce
multi-billion-dollar-profit-making enterprises. OSS world will be populated
by small/medium sized enterprized working closely with customers on niche
areas.

Closed source model played its part in evolving software industry. With the
advent of internet that lost its relevance, and is being slowly replaced by
the OSS model. This is what I feel.

Reiser committing  a crime and/or Linus trying to enforce a trademark are
not relevant in my opinion.

Ma Sivakumar

Not to debate. But give a moment's thought to this. I have a company,
not a software company, say. I need s/w to run my business. In today's
world,  I should be outsourcing it to other s/w companies.  But I
still have my team of s/w people who work with/interface with the
outsourcing company. If the same code is there in OSS, I can employ my
people to fix/customize the gpl'ed code to my need. Can I not? Will it
not be cheaper than outsourcing? *The dispute is not about outsourcing
being right/wrong*. Then why will the OSS company survive? No, I am
not disputing your idea.

That will reduce the number of areas you can concentrate as an OSS
company. More people trying to work on lesser areas breeds competition
and some will have to go *evil*? Correct me, if i am wrong.

Our point is about developer salaries. Now your company has  employed  and
paid salaries to s/w people to fix/customize the code.

In a closed source model the money would have been routed through the vendor
of software and that company would have grown monstrous.

Open Source enables everyone to choose how they should run their business
and distributes wealth and business opportunities more evenly. There will be
no hassles about evil/benign  monopoly, stiffling of innovation etc.

That will reduce the number of areas you can concentrate as an OSS

You need not go to *evil*. You just  can not become a Mittal or Bill Gates
and shake billions of dollars at the world. You will be putting your
resources to the best of your abilities for the benefit of your company as
well as the software ecosystem.

If you do not release the code and use it only internally it is allowed
under GPL. If you are going to distrubute it, then the modified source has
to be provided to the buyers of your software, not necessarily RELEASED
PUBLICLY ( to my understanding)

But, since you can not restrict your buyers from distributing what they
received, in effect your code is available to all.

The original project will expect you (not mandatory) to contribute the
changes back to them. Or they can take from the openly available source. If
neither of that happens, then it is forking. There are multiple versions of
same product.

Thanks. Using the Reiser's arrest to tarnish the OSS business model is a
typical FUD, I feel. They are not related at all. Linus releases his work
under GPL, he is living happily with his family and makes a decent income.
Does it mean that Open Source is good for family life?

two points to be noted here:

1. a view has been expressed that foss and proprietary can co-exist -  
yin and yang. This is not so. Good and evil can never co-exist.  
Either good must prevail or evil must prevail. Yin and yang or  
coexistence can be something like FOSS and OSS or Gnome and Kde. It  
is undisputed that the foss method of software development through  
openeness, sharing, code re-use, non-duplication of code etc etc is  
the best method of software development. So why is this method not  
universally used? Only one reason - fear of the proprietary people  
stealing the code. In short, the very existence of prop software  
tends to stifle and inhibit the growth of a healthy programming  
method/environment.

2. So if all code was free and shared, wouldnt a large number of  
software companies go out of business? wouldnt the programmers be  
starving on the streets? This same argument has been used throughout  
history to resist change. When the automobile came, did all the horse  
carriage owners, and everyone concerned in the horse drawn transport  
industry go out of business? Or did they adapt and change their  
business model? When autos were introduced in chennai in around 1980,  
did the taxis go out of business? Computerisation of banks was  
resisted saying that bank employees would lose their jobs. Have they?  
or are there more bank jobs now. Sure, most software companies will  
have to change their business model or perish. They will change and  
be better for the change.

I have heard lot of not-so good stories about dreamhost.com.
One sample is here: http://www.dreamhost-sucks.com/

I would say go with reliable hosting providers like http://hostgator.com who
might be slightly costly but u wont have any headache.

  The whole point about FOSS is not about the money,
its just that people want to share code just as
knowledge sharing happens in scientific communities as
this just gets things done faster and more
effeciently, without the need to reinvent the wheel. 
  Its upto the individual to draw the line between the
basic need for money and the fun part of hacking. That
said earlier there were huge grants from the
government(atleast the in the US) that took care of
this, but not anymore. 
  And for those of you who are after the big bucks,
get a good business plan, start the next google using
FOSS and forget the peanuts M$ is offering ;)

Hostgator is decent. But one of the best by far is http://www.pair.com
Definitely not cheap though. If you go to the 2000 rupees a year crowd
you just dont get too much good quality, and also run into a lot of
other random issues.

It is a fact of life on the internet that for every fubar.com doing
business online, somebody will register fubar-sucks.com (or
fubarsucks.com or any other variation) and use it to publich perceived
horror stories fubar.com. Which is why most companies have started
registering the "sucks" version when they register their main .com
version. :) Have you seen http://www.hostgator-sucks.com yet?

Dear Kg,

The points you raise are interesting. Thanks for posting them.

However, I do disagree with you on something - there is no evidence to
indicate that FOSS as the philosophy is inherently superior to proprietary
method of development for all types of software. FOSS has worked very well
for some types of software, but not for all.

If ALL software is going to be produced as FOSS by all software companies
(due to some legislation or due to drastic change of heart), then that
would imply that their competitors also have access to their product
source code and are able to sell the same product after including their
own changes/customization and probably at a price point lower than the
original developer because their cost of producing it is zero except for
the cost of distribution.

So not only does the original developer of the product lose the exclusive
right to sell the software which they spent money producing, but they are
also beaten by their competitor who can easily undercut them on price,
support (the competitor can afford to spend more money on support since
they are not having to spend much money on development), packaging and
documentation (it is less expensive to get documentation/manuals developed
for an existing product than it is to actually develop the product and
hence the competitor can choose to spend money towards that) etc.

The original developer is therefore left in a position of weakness against
the competitor and must compete by one or a combination of the following
methods:

a) Reducing the price - Again, a losing proposition because the competitor
can always sell at an even lower price point.

b) Out-innovating the competitor - Again a game one cannot win because the
competitor will get the new features, bug fixes made to the product and
can apply that to the version of the software which they are selling.

c) Provide support - Not very viable either. Yes, it is true that the
original developer may be able to provide better support since the
original developers of the product work for them, however, if the original
developers are sitting and handling support issues where is the time to
actually develop the product. Also, the competitor can take away any of
the developers by offering them a slightly higher salary.

What this does is this. The original developer will now have to add in new
features, fix bugs quicker than their competitor who is now benefitting
from the work of the first developer. So in essence what happens is that
the original developer is doing all the hardwork and all the competitors
will add just minor changes, but are able to sell the product.

Now, these may not be issues for certain types of software such as ERP
software - since companies which purchase ERP products may require support
/ fixes / updates directly from the original developer. Also, companies
are willing to really pay for support - individual users are not.

So it is my opinion that the FOSS model works for software companies only
when the size of the product is very large and it is a very complex piece
of software which requires the support staff / implementor to have
considerable knowhow about the internal workings of the product.

But for ordinary desktop applications, utility software etc which are not
very complete, it only makes sense for individual programmers, or
amorphous teams of programmers to develop them using FOSS philosophy and
notfor a software company.

Another thing - if FOSS is the predominant philosophy of development, the
company making the sofware will have to really reduce the cost of
development to remain competitive with others who can just take down the
code and sell them. In a software company, the primary component of cost
is employee salaries. Conclude what you will from that :)

Regards,
PK

The moment you come up with a black-and-white argument such as this
one above to a socio-economic debate like the present one, you lose.
Anything further you say will only go to prove that you understand
neither sociology nor economics.

Even proprietary companies "share, re-use, duplicate etc." code from
other companies. Every time a copy of Windows XP is sold, a part of
the proceeds go to several non-MIcrosoft companies. Couple of examples
I can think of - the CD burning code in XP is licensed from Roxio.
Codebase of IE is licensed from Spyglass. And so on. It is hardly a
specific FOSS method - everyone, FOSS or non-FOSS, has been using it
for decades.

Argued from the other side, the very existence of FOSS tends to stifle
and inhibit the growth of a healthy programming/software development
industry. Which is why I said this is not a black-and-white,
us-or-them kind of debate.

Again, a bunch of fallacious arguments and non sequiturs. The real
argument is "if I ran a few autos in Chennai that would take
passengers for FREE anywhere they want, will the other autowallahs go
out of business?". Or the bank manager saying: "I can get employees
for FREE under certain conditions, so let me fire all salary-drawing
current employees and fulfil those conditions". And so on.

You could try, but remember, this is the LUG whose 96% members
couldn't be bothered to cast a vote (free!) which decided how the LUG
mailing list should behave. :) Do you really think asking for money
would improve upon that?

your whole argument is based on the assumption that when this  
'nirvana' happens software will still be a product to be sold. It  
wont. It will be a service - and computer professionals will join the  
ranks of lawyers, doctors, chartered accountants etc who dont sell  
knowledge but offer skills.

Well, that depends on how you define a member as active. I'd say 100%
of active members voted - my criteria is that only those who voted are
active members.

This is not looking good.How can you say FOSS is  not evil and proprietary
is ?. Today, many live in this world due to the proprietary model business
and simply stating that IT IS EVIL cannot be agreed. This list may be
regarding FOSS , so it does not claim that Proprietary Model is bad. If that
is the main thing many here want to propagate, then THAT IS BAD!

Evil is a  strong word. But in this context please take it as proprietary
software is not beneficial to the industry as a whole.

All your arguments are pro GPL. None of them explain why `proprietary is
> evil'. Blunt statements as such only inhibit ones view.


1. Closed source developemnt leads to reinventing wheel type of work,
getting resources wasted.
2. Closed source sales and usage means users have to depend on a single
vendor to fix bugs and add new features.
3. Closed source means students can not look at the code and learn.
4. Closed source helps build huge companies which inhibits free spirit in
the market place stiffling innovation. (Microsoft etc.)

and so on.

No way. In that case, Wipro,TCS,Infi,Satyam,Zasken,CTS etc..should not have
been listed in the Top IT Companies.

1. Closed source developemnt leads to reinventing wheel type of work,

Well, It depends on how you model your new product. Closed source need not
lead to reinventing wheel type of work.

2. Closed source sales and usage means users have to depend on a single

Sorry. Today with the advent of BPOs, there is no Single Vendor concept
now.Companies have centres for Support nearly in every region. This need not
be only for Closed Source Model, Even Ubuntu has started the Paid Support
Model, RedHat has. So, if you pay to them YOU ARE DEPENDENT in one way or
other.

3. Closed source means students can not look at the code and learn.


Unless a student needs to.

and so on.


I think still your reasons are blunt.

Why we have to debate this way rather enjoy using the different technologies
which is prevailing in this world ?

This creates two communities and one day people are going to be hatred
towards each other which is gonna lead nowhere and we dont want to be the
cause for that.

Proprietary Model as well ass Open Source Model, both have pros and cons.
Its not that one is good and one is evil. If you like OSS, use them , but
not that you need to tell Proprietary is evil or bad. I use both, but till
today, for business, Propritary Stuffs have yielded profit for us (note "for
us").So it doesnt mean that FOSS is bad, just that this time it has not fit
our business model properly.

Hope we are educated, and try respect ALL technologies around us.

Rockfeller's oil business was listed as a top business in the early 20th
century. That does not stop the economy from evolving a better business and
regulatory model.

I am not comparing Wipro, TCS, Info etc with Rockfeller's business one to
one, just pointing out that if some business model yields profits in a time
period, that does not validate anything.

How would we know if the source is not open?  The algorithm we work right
now might have been implemented successfully, tested to perfection and used
in another software. There is no way to use that wealth in closed source
model.

The point is, if the source code is available with the user/client, he/she
has a last resort option, hiring developers to support it themselves, which
is not available in closed source model.

If Red Hat acts smart and tries to take advantage of a client, the client
has an option to use CentOS and support it internally. That keeps Red Hat
focussed on customer service, rather than arm twisting clients to maximize
their profits.

3. Closed source means students can not look at the code and learn.
>

A student absolutely needs to look at the source code to learn (I mean
Computer Science students). In what situation, a student of CS does not need
to look at source code?

Because, one set of technologies is holding us back.  As KG was pointing
out,  resistance to change  is always there.

No need to have hatred towards each other. If we keep the debate sensible
and communicate with respect, we can foster understanding rather than
hatred.

Proprietary Model as well ass Open Source Model, both have pros and cons.

Yes. I understand your view point. Proprietary stuffs yield profit today. As
a forward looking business we can study the trends and position ourselves to
take advantage of the changes as and when they take shape (as IBM has done
with open source technologies).

Hope we are educated, and try respect ALL technologies around us.


Me too :-)

Hmm. KDE and GNOME? This particular argument is hypocritical - the
same thing is presented as "having a choice" when discussed in context
of Free Software.

To implement a particular feature, KDE or GNOME can freely borrow from each
other. Please consider the components - a nice function or a super designed
class. You have as much choice as you want, but not spending time on what is
already thought out.

Yes, having a choice is important. Closed source model failed in that
important aspect in case of desktop operating systems  :-)

This is very easy in ILUGC and We can raise more then that. But Our
ILUGC needs us physically for the talk, LDD and other FOSS related

Message-ID: <adc51dea0610141115x50a527cdhe1a803c5ef5c8a6e@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

Could someone point me to a USB port sniffer/monitor/spy that could be
run on GNU/Linux. I g00gled and found quite a few spy software like
usbsnoop, usbsniffer, usbmon etc for Windows.. I was unable to find
one for GNU/Linux.

Any pointers?

Enable usbmon in the Linux kernel:

http://www.mail-archive.com/synce-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00254.html

USBMon is a front-end (Java-based). 

http://www.linux-usb.org/USBMon/

http://www.linux-usb.org/USBMon/screenshots/

If anyone is interested in writing a GTK+ or Qt
application equivalent to USBMon, it could be a useful
small GUI project.

There are some similarities to this thread with one that happened last year.
Thankfully, this one is less acrimonious than that one :-) .

The thread is available here:

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2005-September/020946.html

The similarity in issues raised comes further down in that thread. Am
quoting myself from that thread below - an arguement similar to what Prem
has made in this thread:

Am not sure FOSS business model is definitively advantageous to society (of
which the hacker community is only a subset) than proprietary ones.

Why the research activity should take place inside private companies?
Research is the domain of universities and publicly funded institutes. The
model has been tried and tested to create new discoveries and innovations
over centuries.

To add to that, most of the next-big-break-through comes not from large
corporations but from the university labs and young students backyard.

Same as above. You do not pay for the research. You might pay taxes or fixed
royalties to the institute from where the innovations originated. That does
not call for billions of dollars waiting in the bank for
'just-in-case-i-might-need' scenario.

Just imagine the cash held on to by Microsoft coporation (30+ billion
dollars), and how it could have fuelled innovation if released to the
shareholders.

After all corporations exist to serve the society, not the other way around.
The society made specific laws to allow formations of companies to carry out
specific economic activities, which can not be carried out by individuals.
When the companies step outside the boundaries, they have to be held back.

A student appears to have come up with a nice and usable project:
http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/sep62006/cyberspace163748200695.asp

Conceptually, it appears to be sound and could solve a number of problems.
The attempt there is to devise a compact representation of data using
geometric symbols and colors.  It may be possible to achieve a high
degree of compression The innovation is largely about the ability to
represent text and other info as visible pictures that is called there
as
"rainbow format".  Incidentally, it allows storing compressed data on
just plain paper, that is another major innovation.

Try using -fno-stack-protector to CFLAGS as suggested.

Why not? You're forgetting that most academic projects go nowhere near a 
market, and most of them continue to remain 'of academic interest'. If 
they do, they will take a long time to mature into marketable 
technologies. I'm not saying universities play any lesser role in 
innovation - their role is indisputable in basic research, which most 
companies shy away from.

Not always. One can also argue that corporations have  a better feel of 
the market, and what technology/product might or might not work. They 
have a more ready understanding of the current big problems faced by the 
industry and are willing to deploy significant capital if you can 
provide a solution.

I doubt it, unless you 'release' the money to universities (for specific 
projects) or fund startups with that money. Most shareholders of big 
companies are pension funds, institutional investors and regular people 
employed in other fields, but are interested in making money on the 
stock market. Paying dividends would make them happy, but not much apart 
from that.

Excuse me? Corporations don't exist to 'serve' the society. They can 
solve your problems - provide facilities - provided you can pay the 
money. They are not morally obligated to serve the society, but they do 
anyways because they create jobs, increase your standard of living, 
deploy capital efficiently, etc. Are you, as an individual, obligated to 
'serve' the society? It's your choice. So why do the rules change for 
corporations? After all, they are just a bunch of people operating under 
a common entity. If they want to make money, they have equal right to 
take the position.

(of course, we all 'serve' the society much better than most NGOs by 
paying taxes - which of course, is possible only if there are enough 
jobs to go around - and we all agree it's the premise of the private 
enterprise)

As the saying goes, 'it depends'. It's beneficial in the way that it 
reduces the barriers for startups to operate - and students to gain 
hands-on knowledge. But when you want to build a company with a 
definitive competitive advantage, you can't afford to throw your source 
code away. Because, your technology is what gives you the competitive 
advantage. Yeah, you can use open source tools, definitely (yes, I'm 
hinting at big G) but your 'crown jewels' cannot be open-source. They 
set you apart from the rest of the pack - you build your products with 
blood, sweat and money for a reason.

Do we expect a company like Apple or Sony to give away it's hardware 
design plans? No. It's highly secret, their future as a corporation 
depends on them. It's their right to have it & keep it secret because 
they invested in it, and they expect a reasonable return for it. You 
think you can do better? Sure, go ahead, start another company.

Now it became circular, no? :-)

I asked the question to say that a company need not earn huge profits to
support R&D efforts. That can be funded publicly.

The biggest originator of new marketable technologies is defence
departments, which are publicly funded.

Not always. One can also argue that corporations have  a better feel of

With market driven private research we find more money going in for hair
loss treatment compared to treatment to Malaria. Research is better done
through public funding.

When a company grows too big, its focus is only on their customers. They
lose sight of other opportunities. With Microsoft's pc monopoly, the
personal pc paradigm froze at desktops.  MS would not invest in develop a
new paradigm, why should they?

If there were free play of ideas, probably we would have half a dozen
personal pc user interface paradigms to suit different cultures, use
patterns.

The point is they were just sitting on it. The resources could have been
deployed more effectively when distributed outside (as dividends, larger
bonuses or lower product pricing). Each individual putting his money to his
best interests is the way to innovation, right?

Corpoations are allowed to SERVE the society. If everyone is on his own,
where will corporations come from. Society has decided through governments
to organize production and distribution through group of individuals and
provide them legal protection and incentives to form corporations.

Otherwise corporations do not have the basic right to life as an individual
does. It is a creation of our legal system. that is all.

As the saying goes, 'it depends'. It's beneficial in the way that it

Your crown jewels should be customer service and delivering efficient
products. Why should be hoarded information be the crown jewels of a
company?

That model is flawed and does not benefit the industry as a whole, that is
my understanding.


Sure, go ahead, start another company.


That is what happening in thousands of start ups around the world. In 10-15
years we will have a truly free market economy (atleast in software
industry), free of domination by the monsters.

Message-ID: <4531D93F.60905@gmail.com>

Hi all,

This is in regards with the Wiki page belonging to the chennaiLUG which 
hasn't been available for quite some time. Many of us are handicapped a 
bit without the wiki available. The current link to the page in 
chennailug.org says the wiki page will be available in a short period, 
which had been there for quite some time.

Now, one of our old active chennai LUG mates have come forward to work 
on bringing the wiki up. To add on, he is the one who had actually 
contributed to the wiki page when it was first put up. I hereby like to 
inform the admin who is looking after the chennailug.org to co-ordinate 
with Sridhar Ratna (srid at nearfar dot org) so that we get our wiki up 
as soon as possible. Sridhar is very much eager to fix things and bring 
up the wiki, which he actually set up years back. Hope, atleast this 
time the issue is looked up with more importance and some one who is 
volunteering to do it is given a chance to contribute :)

Hope our Wiki comes back alive on chennailug.org soon !

Yes , I agree. Academic Projects are done so most of the time as Semester
Projects or put up in IEEE papers, but we do see them rarely come up in
Market. Its not that none of the projects come up to market.

Vamsee, you are in a FOSS list and if you ask the question to this group now
as this thread is going on, they would suggest that Apple and Sony should
give away their hardware. For the FOSS , it doesnt matter whether it is big
firm or small, what does all matter is FREEDOM, which they firmly believe
that it can be brought from only OSS Model(which i think , they are inclined
towards only FOSS that makes them to utter this).

How many in ths World, use a Linux Distribution, rebuild for their personal
use and again use them?. We are talking about Business. There is no "we will
try" in the Business World, else you are sued by your Investors. The
solution what you chosse should be Business Ready. Simply for the sake that
am FOSS person, I could not say that "I can make it to work, but just give
me few days" - Believe me, that "few days" does matter. I cann give you
several examples but thats confidential.

Not all who use FOSS do rebuild things, except Product Development Companies
which are handling FOSS prototypes. Just think am a service based company,
how much profit I can expect from handling OSS calls and charge those people
? . People cannot be charged more than extent due to the FOSS(Free)
world.But in the other regards, try to also have support for other
platforms, like Microsoft,Apple, think of your comany. It is going to earn
you much profit than only adopting FOSS Model.

Wat does Microsoft does not allow you to play with their OS ?. *I am
bringing this as many have told nothing can be done with Microsoft OS*.,Not
to create another fight :).
Except rebuilding the OS, you can do anything to their OS, even write a
Kernel Stub of your own, get certified from Microsoft so that it comes along
with next release or as a redistributable supported by Microsoft.There are
various resources and forums available for help as MSDN.As of today, I have
not seen ANY equivalent to MSDN in terms of help.


   - Need Forums ?  - http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/forums
   - Need Communities ? -
   http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/default.mspx
   - Need to learn various Microsoft Technologies ? -
   http://www.microsoft.com/communities/webcasts/default.mspx
   - Want to program and dont know where to start or thinking that you
   need to buy Visual Studio for developing Programs? - No, one need not buy
   Visual Studio for that. Microsoft has launched free Studio Express Editions
   along with respective MSDN Content -
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/
   - Want to try some ongoing research works from Microsoft and join them
   ? - http://research.microsoft.com
   - Want to know how to write drivers for windows platform ? -
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnanchor/html/DeviceDriver.asp

Still the list goes on. One cannot say that its totally not aggreeable to
hold Proprietary Model and does not give advantage.The same I can also list
for FOSS, I have not stated that these are only possible via Microsoft. Just
to tell you that same as FOSS, there does exist and they have helped me a
LOT.

*I know I should not have listed all these, but to show people who are
telling that EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE ONLY THRU FOSS are wrong. In any
technology, one can do MANY THINGS.*

If this is an OT and If some think this should not be discussed here
pertaining to this thread, please, go delete it, I dont mind.

Sorry to be harsh, but I have to. I just cant tolerate telling that ONLY
FOSS is good and PROPRIETARY is evil and at the same time propagating it !

Thanks to all who participated in the IRC meet.

Some people who were there includes

1. mbuf
2. kmap -> Kumar A
3. rsubr -> superman
4. kkrish
5. techno_freak
6. tuxmaniac & ThiefOfBaghdad
7. Casanova

Quite subjective. If a company wants to give you better hair, why stop 
it? There are pharma companies (I'm not saying they are paragons of 
virtue) which spend billions of dollars on R&D on stuff like malaria, 
aids and what not.

I'm not really trying to make a point here, but are you sure you want 
that? Do you really want to learn half-a-dozen desktop paradigms to help 
a hapless user? Or would he prefer working on a different desktop 
everytime he changes companies? He simply doesn't care.  Standardization 
has it's own benefits. Use when it makes sense. Innovate and change it 
when it gets cumbersome.

No, there is a need for such a structure while conducting business. The 
legal system or government makes certain rules under which they can 
operate, so that they don't cheat each other or the consumers. Which is 
fine. What I'm trying to say is, the courts or government don't 
_sanction_ a company. There is a need for such a structure, so the govt. 
recognizes it and provides a framework for it's operation.

Because, efficiency is not the only game in town, as Dell is finding out 
painfully, as Apple has just surpassed it in revenues and market cap. 
Tell me honestly, what do you prefer? A me-too Dell/Compaq/HP laptop or 
a MacBookPro? When you do ground-breaking stuff, you want to keep it 
under wraps until the technology is workable and make sure your 
competitors won't steal your work and beat you to the market. I guess 
the argument turns philosophical too, from here. As for me, as a 
consumer, I really don't care if Apple keeps it's plans secret as long 
as it's turning out those yummy products. If Apple becomes lazy, there's 
always another Zune to keep it awake.

Sure, but some of those startups are sure to become Goliaths (or 
monsters, so to speak) but a free market economy always has incentives 
for Davids to stand up and take a shot at them :). Thanks, good points, 
it's a pleasure to have a discussion when there's no acrimony in the 
arguments.

My point is before that destruction happens how much we lose as a society? A
company holding back the industry for a decade before  a David can emerge.
That can be avoided.

Standardization is  good. But  why should a farmer have a desktop paradigm
when he does not use a desk for his work?

In my opinion, the lack of PC penetration in India is due to the design
constraint, which is highly oriented towards a western audience.

Yes, we agree here.

The need for a such a structure is recongnized by the government (the
society).

But when the actions of such a structure overtakes the benefits of
fulfilling the needs, then the government/courts (society) has the right to
step in (regulation).

Can  not wait for the market to play it out, because in the first place in a
free market there would have been no corporations. You created something,
you better monitor it.

I have not used a Mac, so I can not comment. If Apple has a super plan and
the final implementation is crap, will we use it? The user experience and
customer service is the key. Won't you agree?

The point is OSS model will help preventing emergence of Goliaths. That is
why it is less evil :-)

They can - but don't. Think of the multitude of SMTP servers available
as free software. The least they could have done is to implement a
common configuration file format - so that users exercising their
right to choice could do so as painlessly as possible. Did they?

Recently I downlaoded LFS 6.2-3 and tried to work with it.
All I could get is CLI only.
When I give startx command I get the following error:

"

I tried to copy the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file from another working linux
partition
but still the problem persists.

Please guide me.

Hello,

I have commented out all except 2 terminals for my system (in my inittab
file):
# Note that on most Debian systems tty7 is used by the X Window System,
# so if you want to add more getty's go ahead but skip tty7 if you run X.

#5:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty5
#6:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty6


However, when I start the system, all I get all 6 terminals active. I am
on Ubuntu Edgy Eft, which uses the upstart initialising system instead
of sysvinit. Could it be because of that?

How do I ensure that only 2 getty terminals are started?

No valid modes found could be due to your resolution
settings. Are you using Xorg or XFree86? You might
want to check your resolution settings. Try running
xorgcfg (if using Xorg) or xf86cfg (if using XFree86).
These should help you configure the X server in the
GUI.

The default scripts, I believe, are in /etc/event.d:

http://upstart.ubuntu.com/doc/getting-started.html

Check out some example scripts from here for your
tty1, tty2 modification:

Hi all !
During installation (text mode) Ubuntu 6.06 ( Drapper Drake) on a friend's laptop (Acer Travelmate) the screen went blank suddenly after about 38% was completed during the file installation process. 

The graphical mode installation completed with no hassles. What could be the reason ?

A similar problem also occured while installing Edubuntu 6.06 on a friend's Desktop .

Could be a power-saving setting adjustable in the BIOS or whatever
system management software that shipped with the laptop.

Well, I may partially agree with you.Here is an interesting
Article<http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/3636251>.
I see the reasons to be genuine as I have faced them personally.May be
others did not. Even the figures what he has mentioned are true.

By default LFS uses xorg.
I assumed the default settings for X.
Since it did not work for me, I tried X -configure which again was
unsusccesful.
Then I ran xorgconfig , being careful enough to select the correct video
modes
(as I have done the same ample number of times in slackware), but still the
problem persists.

I had the same problem in some other distro, about a year back, and I forgot
how I corrected that.

Message-ID: <20061016042605.GA23205@lakshmi.susmita.org>

Dear friends,

     This is a program I wrote for my own personal need. I felt it might be of general use, so I am making it public after a little bit of polishing.

     I am sick and tired of forgetting birthdays and anniversaries of people I know. So I thought I will automate things so that they receive the wish automatically from my e-mail ID. For them it will be indistinguishable whether I sent it or the system sent it...

     Moreover I made sure that the mail is sent at 09:00 am to give the illusion that I am awake and typing...

     Anyway It is just a 45 line shell script. Take a look, you might like it.

     But I am assuming few things.
     a) You have mutt installed
     b) Your machine is setup to send e-mail 

     There are other assumptions but these are the most important ones.

     I will spend a moment explaining the events.txt file format as that is the only critical component of the entire scheme of things.

     It is just 5 fields delimited by | (pipe) symbol.

     It is 

     Appellation | e-mail id1,e-mail id2...| bday or mday | Mnemonic date | date in mm/dd format

     Here is a good example.

     Amma and appa |dad@yahoo.com,mom@gmail.com|mday|Oct 5|10/05

     E-mail IDs need to be separated by comma and any number can be given.

     (No comments or spaces are handled outside the appellation field)

     And you can have multiple events triggered on the same day of course.

     Right now I am handling only marriage anniversaries and birthdays. In f uture it can be made to wish for Bakrid,Deepavali and so on. :-)

     So the above line will send a nice graphic wishing marriage anniversary on Oct 5th every year as an e-mail from you which starts with

     "Dear Amma and appa,"


     Just download the file from 

     http://girish1729.googlepages.com/aeg.tar.gz

     and untar it and execute the setup.sh shell script.

     Hope you like it! :-)

Girish,

Good work :-)

But wont it be nice to send yourself a email reminding about the day so that
you can compile a personalised message to the concerned person.

Nice effort, thanks.

Consultants, you mean. Great way to look at it like that. In more ways
than one, I agree with that idea too. Software will not be a product
to sell. Any addition of my idea here will create yet another string
of replies. [OT]I am happy that I am using gmail for this topic. It
atleast tries to group this as a single conversation!

There exists a program called birthday which is supposed to give pop ups.

I have never used it.

And yahoo! calendars and various other groupware stuff.

But none to suit my taste of simplicity and elegance. 

I am too busy to send a personalised mail. I don't believe in living upto the expectations of the society. :-)

Such things make me socially acceptable. :-)

Dear Friends,

I try to install ubuntu 6.06 lts on the following motherboard category

845 Chipset
Intel original 101 GGc

with Memory of 256 MB

The installation failed in the middle, after asking the language selection
screen, nothing seems to
really progressing while the CD drive seems to be in constant access.

Any one witness similiar experience.

Ubuntu 5.10 is a cake walk installation, but 6.06 seems to be missing '6' in
the omen 666, atleast for me.

Cheers

You are welcome dear Parthan.

I shall try whenever possible to share my experiences and programs.

As Parthan said more and more people should share their code. :-)

That way ILUGC will be the best LUG in the world.

A wise man once told me:

"Free Software is not about altruism but about self-preservation".

Your notion that companies need to _give_away_ software as charity is
wrong. When a company decides to contribute to the Free software
society it is doing it mainly on _business_ grounds.

Robert 'r0ml' Lefkowitz explains this beautifully in his talk
'Seismology of Open Source'[1] why OpenSource/Free Software is what it
is today. I suggest you give it a hear.

Google is an excellent example of FOSS-based business. They spent
years  developing their products behind closed doors using FOSS. Today
their needs on Free Software is so much that they _NEED_ to hire the
best Free Software developers available. Do you think people like Greg
Stein, Guido and Andrew Morton are hired by Google out of charity ? Do
you think each of their commits is blessed by Google's do-no-evil
deity ? The truth is Google needs Free Software as a form of
self-preservation because it depends on it, there is no charity
involved in any case. The Free Software community is not being
charitable towards Google nor is Google being charitable to the
free-software community. It's a symbiotic relationship.

Of course, Google was not a active FOSS-player from day-one of it's
inception and so will no other startup be. The transition towards
being a citizen of the Free Software society takes three steps (IMHO)
and in the coming years all _mega_corporations_ will have to take it.

1. Recognize that the Free Software community exists. (discovery)
2. Utilize Free Software as a replacement to proprietary software and
discover the merits if any exist (usage).
3. If the outcome from Step 2 is positive , then make sure that the
free software being used for it's needs is the best. (perfection)
4. Contribute the changes made to the community on a case-by-case
basis (active contribution).

A FOSS based business never starts out thinking it is going to
actively contribute code back to the community. As it evolves and
reaches a strong position (while still using FOSS), contribution to
Free Software becomes an eventuality.

That is exactly the point. They will need FOSS developers, you still
cannot commit google search algorithm to my subversion, can you? You
work for Proprietory FOSS.

They will not have to be. Google kinda rules a part of the market!

Sounds like a vision statement. Realisable, agreed.

This is vision.

There are always going to be some parts of software which will be very
specific to a business. Releasing it as Free Software will not be a
value add. Honestly, if Google did release their implementation as a
FOSS product how many would be interested in using it ? The
implementation would be tied into Google's infrastructure that any
small-company which hopes to emulate Google will not be able to afford
to use it as efficiently as Google does.

OTOH, They do believe in sharing knowledge[1] [2] which is good. The
algorithm is there for you, go ahead and implement it if you want to
use it.

Correct. Hence Google gets the best. The rest of the developers will

I ve been to the oracle link myself. Anyways, this is not their major
work. They do this also. Like I said, If I earnt millions in my
business, I will not hesitate to setup a FOSS division and contribute
to the community. But, that FOSS may not (read need not) return me
anything. Am I converting my business to FOSS? No, atleast I think
not.

I have faced such issues during installation in Jaya Engineering 
college, but later found it to be a media error issue. Some CDs, even 
shipped ones, have some error in the media which causes these kind of 
problems during installation. For a lucky few, it indeed gets installed 
but not guaranteed. Better try with another CD, which is not a copy of 
the CD you are using.

Ahh, just because of a media issue tagging something as Omen is not 
acceptable. I have installed Dapper Drake in around 40 computers now, 
including a couple of laptops. I have never faced a situation where I 
wasn't able to install (there were initial problems due to CDs which 
were copied from shipped CDS, but not done properly).

/me dreams of thyagu using edgy beta and trying to run updates 
everyday...  o_O /me wakes up from the nightmare ;)

Dear guys,

     I am really really sorry for having taken such a loooooong time.

     Actually I have been preparing, preparing,preparing.....zzzzzzzzzz

     But the good news is that a lot of cloud in my head has cleared and my time has not been wasted.

     In order to avoid further delay let me commit a deadline. Hopefully I will meet it.

     Please don't consider this an annoucement, that will be later.

     This is just a promise.

     I shall send the slides by Nov 15th. So we can plan the talk three weeks hence since I had promised 3 weeks notice long ago.

     Which means if all goes well talk will be sometime December.

     Please bear with me as I have several several things piled up.

     And this talk is also extremely important for me.

     regards,

Agreed that the companies mentioned above are not using FOSS as their
USP. But they   are not doing this for charity either, which proves
the point that 'FOSS is not about charity'.

Not sure whether this relates to a bug in the installer, but many, 
including me have had the installer crash during the installation.

Try with the alternate CD.  It works.

My sincere apologies to the list, if any of my statements so far
suggested that FOSS is all about charity. I was all the time trying to
sell the point that FOSS cannot become that glossy business that
proprietary companies do. Again, there are exceptions to both sides
(before someone points that out!)

But, the point to ponder is *Should FOSS try to be business?* No, let
us not start any debate over this, atleast I haven't constructed my
argument!!!

FOSS is a software development methodology and not a business methodology.
You can structure the software development practices in your business
on FOSS. On whether FOSS is the only business methodology , I don't
think so. FOSS is both "Freedom to" and "Freedom From" . How you plan
on using it, it's up to the individual.

A commendable effort. I have only four points to make.

1. From your setup script:

echo "Copying image files........."
sleep 1
\cp anniv.png ${HOME}/.aeg

That is the Microsoft way of doing things :) Why do you have that sleep there?

2. Your aeg script has a race condition; on multiuser systems with
malicious users, this can lead to arbitrary files owned by the user
running AEG to be wiped out. mktemp(1)  is the safe way of creating
temporary files.

3. You don't seem to be using the fourth field of your events file
anywhere. In fact, it is identical to the fifth field.

4. All your lines which goes "| cut -d '|' ..." can be replaced far
cleaner with the bash inbuilt command "set".

The trick in writing good shell scripts is to use bash builtins more
and external commands less, for maximum efficiency. For example, your
loop:

while [ $lines -ne 0 ]; do line=`sed -n ${lines}p $file`; do_stuff
$line; lines=`expr $lines - 1`; done

can be rewritten as

while read line; do do_stuff $line; done < $file

and you have eliminated the external sed & expr program invocations
and also the need for your $lines variable.

Stepwise instructions - to view Unicode Tamil text

1. You need to have Unicode Tamil fonts installed on your computer and the
Operating System capable of rendering Tamil Scripts. Windows XP comes with a
Unicode Tamil Font (Latha) and you need not download/install a unicode font.
2. In the Control Panel, in Regional/Languages Options you will need to
ensure that Indic/Asian Language option is checked.
3. Use a browser that is capable of handling UTF-8 based pages (Netscape 6,
Internet Explorer 5) with the Unicode Tamil font chosen as the default font
for the UTF-8 char-set/encoding view. Unicode Tamil Fonts may be downloaded
from http://www.tamilnation.org/fonts/latha.ttf

+1 Had the same problem.
The Installer hung during the partitioning stage and never proceeded.
This was after multiple tries and even after trying different media.
Heard that the 'alternate CD' works better but I've never tried it.

M$ word is used by many people for creating documents. We all know M$ does
not share the source code for this and is evil.  Now Google has started
providing a service which competes with M$ Word (not yet .... lets just
assume so for the sake of this arguement). To an end user, say a doctor,
both provide the same service - that of creating documents.

Now, just because Google uses open source technologies is it in any way less
evil than M$? They too have not shared the Writely code with the rest of the
world! Whether it is useful for the rest or not is irrelevant. Let them
release it and let the 'rest' decide whether its useful or not. Can they
afford to do this?

Or, is it alright if I keep the source code to myself as long as I run it on
my computer and only provide the service to others - software as service
model. Is it evil only if I sell a binary and ask the user to run the
service for himself? So, if M$ stops selling all software and does only MSN
Live... will they stop being evil?

How does all this matter to the doctor anyway?

regds,
mano

The only thing matters is - "I have downloaded/bought your Software(Word
application) and It should satisfy my needs, If not your s/w is waste for
me(no wonder what Business Strategy you follow)"

If it not going to benefit the end-user, its waste. For me, personally OO is
not as good as M$ Office and I wouldnt recommend it to any of Windows Users.

I am not sure I agree. FOSS is a philosophy which defines how software is
transferred to clients, how it is distributed and what they can do with
that software. That is, it is not a software development methodology (like
waterfall, iterative etc) or a methodology which defines how software
teams are organized (like XP).

It is a fact that unless a s/w is nearly as good as a commercial 
alternative, it will not gain momentum. On OO Vs MS Word, mileage varies 
from one person to another. I have been a Word user for a very long time 
and switched to OO. I found it measures up quite well. I suspect this 
would be the case for many so long integration across spreadsheets, 
documents and databases are not very high on the list.

There is a reason. :-)

I have clearly written that it is mnemnonic. 

That is actually meant to solve the confusion between mm/dd and dd/mm formats for dates. You can easily look at an entry and identify.

That field is meant for humans, not for the program.

Binand,

	I should thank you a million times for this bcoz you really made me look a fool and I really appreciate it.

	Because I was actually looking for a construct like that and I did not know the "while read line" thing.

	I tried it and it works.

	Besides your argument of avoiding external commands, my argument for this would be that it is really clean and simple.

	It is like using 10 words to explain something that can be told in one word.

	Which is better?

	Thanks. I learnt something new today.

	ILUGC rocks ! :-)

Yep, this is the single biggest argument used against FOSS. The
developer is usually not particular about users' requirements or
security considerations. Developer's response is in most cases, "works
for me". I'd imagine 60% of the patches Redhat includes are about
fixing things like race conditions etc. because the developer could
not be bothered to fix silly bugs like these.

> That is actually meant to solve the confusion between mm/dd and dd/mm formats for dates. You can easily look at an entry and identify.

But you are asking your user to enter the same information twice, in
slightly different formats. Why don't you use one format and convert
to the other if need be? How would you like if a program asked you,
"Enter IP address in x.y.z.t format" and in the next window, asks you
"Enter same IP address as a 32-bit integer"?

Well, given this $line:

Amma and appa |dad@yahoo.com,mom@gmail.com|mday|Oct 5|10/05

And this snippet:

declare -x oldifs="$IFS"; declare -x IFS="|"; set -- $line; declare -x
IFS="$oldifs"

You can then have:

appellation="$1"
mailids="$2"
event="$3"
event_date="$5"

and you don't have a single fork/exec combo for external programs in
your script for this (and most of the code above is concerned about
restoring IFS, which you can ignore inside a shell script under
certain conditions).

In addition, this messy bit:

        TODAY=`date +%D | cut -d/ -f1-2`
        event_date=`echo ${line} | cut -d'|' -f5 `
        if [ "${TODAY}" = "${event_date}" ];then
                send_email
        fi

is far cleaner if you go as (with event_date coming from your FOURTH
field ("Oct 16"), not the fifth):

if [ `date +%j` -eq `date +%j -d $event_date` ]; then
    send_mail
fi

Putting code in public domain has legal issues in some areas like 
bringing in personal liability to developers concerned.

http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Licensing_and_Law/public-domain.html

If your goal is to let anyone use it within no restrictions, it would be 
better to use a simple permissive license like MIT or BSD license instead.

Interesting argument but I actually agree and I have uploaded the new versio with all your comments. 

Check out!

Coming to your argument I think you are right.

Open source developers don't actually care much about users or polish to be precise but then I find the quality of open source code to be much better since they are actually bothered that others are going to see it.

Whereas propreitary code ends up being really ugly, complex and buggy and too feature ridden...

So you can use the argument both ways.

I would go for a sensible open source development approach.

And user friendliness should make the user know what he is doing rather than treating him as an idiot. That is why I did not put the crontab entry myself.

Disagree, your case and my example are completely different.

I prefer my way. We in India use dd/mm and the script uses mm/dd.

Can cause a great deal of heartache...

Looks very interesting and smart but I prefer my way.

For me, an internal representation using digits and slashes without space characters are better for data munching than a human readable form which is retrofitted to work in programs...

However appreciate your input at the same time.

Thanks.

Guys,

	Please check out the latest bug fixed version!

	I think you should run it! It is very very colorful!

	Even in console, it looks so cool I have hardly seen such a nicely written console GUI.

	No, I am not boasting, I am just happy at my setup script.

	However I definitely want to learn ncurses programming and programming using the dialog utility..

Thanks Rahul. I am really really surprised at the wide vistas and viewpoints one gets in ILUGC. No other forum I know of is so helpful.

All these years I have been a clueless hacker writing code and I have not had to think of licensing.

But I certainly understand that it is important and it is high time I understood the implications of what I am doing.

I think I will just go ahead with the BSD licensing for future code.

Not decided yet, but that is how it looks now.

Thanks again for opening my eyes.

Much appreciated.

Rahul,

	What does that mean? What has copyright got to do with licensing?

	And ....

	Can you please elucidate?

Copyright is the exclusive and automatic right on any work that you 
create. It covers the creative expression of your idea. A copyright 
license would allow you to dictate the terms under which your original 
rights can be exercised by others. Copyright licenses unlike contracts 
does not cover actual execution or usage of the program. The difference 
between a proprietary license and a Free software license is the 
spectrum of rights you grant to users (ie) freedom to copy, creative 
derivative works and redistribute the program. Permissive licenses such 
as MIT or BSD license does not impose restrictions on redistributions 
while "copyleft" licenses like the GPL do.

forced to understand these ideas working in a distribution level.

Well, digits and slashes constitute a human readable form and is
usually retrofitted, whereas the internal representation is actually

In this particular case, adoption of open formats have much more of a

There a number of reasons for maintaining patches. Specific or system 
wide features where upstream hasnt been convinced of the benefits, lag 
time between distribution release and the release of the individual 
components etc but usually upstream projects are willing to take patches 
even where they dont see the benefit to code in the particular feature 
or bug fix themselves.

nothing rude about it. For me, ive tried a couple of times and  
failed. But failed, not because of the model, but because i did it  
part time. I have pointed out elsewhere in this thread successes -  
again whether they are all purely on the foss model or hybrids needs

I am involved with a project in IIT-Madras, where we are looking for
a group of vibrant people who can get involved in a project that
requires knowledge of RSS, Ajax, HTML etc with a bit of mix with mobile
technologies. The rule so far is to hire as much as young professionals
as possible, cause this seems to be quite a creative project so far and
there are a lot of big companies backing this up. Imagine, working on
your dream project without having to worry about strained budgets or a
difficult boss *cough cough*

Very concise, to the point and simple to understand. 

Now I understand why you are not a lawyer because lawyers are trained to confuse people. :-)

Hey, no flame bait, just having some fun. 

I am told that the copyright for code written by service companies by Infosys actually belongs to the other company rather than Infosys.

Is that true? Why is that so?

Anyway I don't care.

When a person or entity is creating a work that is paid for by another 
entity or consumer, the client might want to hold the copyright over the 
work which can be done through a mutual contract  (I pay you, you give 
me all rights over the work I paid for) or a unilateral copyright 
assignment.

The ownership of copyright is usually negotiated beforehand and
explicitly mentioned in the contract between the service provider and
client.

I would like to install linux on a PIII 500MHz processor with 64MB RAM.
I would like to have a decent (good looking window manager) and would like to use openoffice on the system. 
Will this be possible? If so which distro, which window manager.

I run Debian GNU/Linux on a PIII 500 Mhz, 128 MB RAM
with Gnome/Icewm/Fluxbox. Works like a charm!

Not sure how X will run on 64 MB RAM, but, if you can
add some more RAM, it will be helpful.

Thanks Balachandar. Appreciate it.

1. I have to tried to update Events page with events
conducted in the last 6 months. 

http://chennailug.org/wiki/?title=Events

I have missed out on few events - don't remember the
dates. I request the members to kindly add them.

2. The old logins are not present. You need to create
new logins for yourselves.

3. Please update CDs for Grabs as most of you would be
having latest CDs/DVDs.

Seems like it is still vulnerable to wiki-spamming? Captcha or
something else should be implemented on the signup page asap?

This is not quite correct. The question for any entrepreneur (or in
fact, any businessman) is "how to increase the shareholder value?".
Several companies make heavy losses but still have created
considerable shareholder value and hence have been acquired at massive
costs. A recent example is Youtube.

FOSS-based software businesses don't create the kind of value you see
in other software companies because the source code, where they spend
the bulk of their funding in, in itself (the intellectual property)
doesn't have any value. Source code has been commoditized.

Actually though I said "I don't care" I really do because quoting the example of Infosys and other Indian companies someone actually told me this when he paid for my work.

This is scary, isn't it? It is like saying that you are my ghost writer since I pay you.

I understand that you can buy several things with money but I think one has to draw a line as to what one loses for the sake of money.

The other day Raja was telling me something about copyright and intellectual property, but I did not get what he was saying. I think his view differed from this.


My personal take on the matter seems to be that I may for the sake of money and business be ready to relinquish my ownership once in a while but never on a regular basis...

Anyway this insight will help me in future.

Many thanks for it.

I have a machine PII 233 Mhz 128 MB RAM on which I am running FreeBSD 6.0

I have another PIII 350 Mhz 128 MB RAM on which I am running OpenBSD 3.9

I delibrately installed Debian GNU/Linux in the faster machine since I knew linux too well...

Anyway I have tried installing Debian on the other machines and it installs without any problem. I have tried installing Gentoo and it failed.

I have previously installed and worked on Debian in a really crappy piece of hardware, but I don't recollect the configuration.

In fact I never realized that Debian is one of the few distros out there that simply works on any damn hardware you install...

Certainly not true about other distros though...

As Shakthi said, RAM is key, buy a 64 MB RAM if money is a problem because unfortunately even though pen drives and other flash memory prices are having a free fall RAM prices aren't. Moreover there are so many varieties which are so confusing to my brain.

OpenOffice? It is bloatware, if I were you I wouldn't try running it.

Since your processor is much faster than mine if you add RAM you might get away with it. But I wouldn't advise using it on a regular basis since you will waste your time and patience and it is not worth it.

Good looking window manager? I have not tried too many but IMHO the best looking and most convenient is windowmaker(http://www.windowmaker.org).

There are several several of them like ratpoison,matchbox and so on.

Avoid KDE. Gnome will work like a charm.

What to talk of the superiority of C vs C++? Gnome is written in C though it uses OO concepts and it blazing fast.

KDE can be used to squeeze and torture your system if you are into that sort of thing...

Best,

And the best have made millions remaining proprietary. Even if I am

Every engineer (read professional) must be a philosopher. It will help

What we tend to forget here when we make comparisons of FOSS vs
Proprietary models is the time-frame which it has taken for the above
mentioned companies to reach the stature of multi-million dollar
empires.

Let's just go back and have a look at their beginnings.

- Microsoft[1] Founded in 1975, which means it has taken them 31 years
to reach the current position as leader in the Software business.

- IBM [2] : Founded in 1888, whew! more than 100+ years in existence.

- Apple and Oracle [3][4] : Founded in 1976 and 77 respectively, a
couple of 30 year old corporations.

[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MICROSOFT
[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM
[3] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer
[4] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation

Now I want all of you to make an assumption that we are in the 1970's.
A time when selling computer hardware (big iron b0xen) was considered
the most(only) viable business model in the software industry.
Hardware was 'proprietary' back then, not the off-the-shelf industry
it is today. With that in mind consider the mentality of Bill Gates,
Larry Ellison and the Steve's as they start to go about creating their
business plans. They would have asked the same question which we are
(sort of)asking today, 'How can proprietary software be a viable
software model when compared to proprietary hardware which has created
such million-dollar businesses ?'.

I'm sure they would not have had an answer to that question, as is the
same case today. But consider the fact that a few determined
individuals do take the plunge at the same time believing that the
FOSS-business model is the right way forward for the future of the
computer industry then think of the implications that these companies
will have after 30+ years of their inception.

Ofcourse, this is purely based on the fact that what they are
selling/marketing is unique enough that it creates a need in the
market and people would like to pay for it. I see RedHat/Canonical and
Novel worth keeping an eye on for the next 30 years. Remember, MS had
to wait nearly 30 years before their product (Win 3.0) could create
sufficient demand for them. Also, remember that Apple was once on the
verge of bankruptcy.

The real question to ask oneself is, 'Am I going to sit and debate
about whether the business-model which I'm seeing grow in front of me
is a good one or not or take a risk and plunge into it and see what
happens ?'

By the time a business model is stabilized and an industry has grown
around it, it's usually too late for a brilliant industrialist to make
his move. That's why you see so many web-based startups meet so much
success. The time is now ripe for a FOSS-based startup's to flourish.
The question is, 'Do you want to see them grow, or grow one yourself'.

Well we can counter/accept this for FOSS after maybe another 30 years.

Would they have? That was a time when nobody was writing Linux for
free. They did need some kind of (at least) assembly language to
operate on these machines. That they could foresee a requirement to do
software is why they are what they are today.

IBM had os/2 and I read from some books that it is amongst the best
OSes written till date. Maybe they don't ship it any more. I dont even
know how user friendly it is. Technically a superior one as claimed in
some literature. They had a huge hardware business and a very
sucessful one. If os/2 were to ship free and remain open (I agree,
nobody thought in those lines), would there have been a windows at
all? Not that I want windows here today. But when they neednt have
seen software as a viable business option, they neednt have sold it.
Wouldnt you agree?

I needed that. This is why I avoid quoting examples!!

My wishes to those. But let me tell you- Keep business and interests
separate whenever possible. If all you want is market share, then one
thing to do is keep competitors at bay. And give me some good ways of
doing that with FOSS and I will buy one.
>Also, remember that Apple was once on the

So was IBM, they were in h/w industry. Not bankrupt but huge losses.
That is a part of most business and is irrelevant to being FOSS/not.
But can you survive one is an important question.

Can we stop this from now on ?.

I am sure, nobody is going to agree to each other and just go on discussing.
Each ones perception is different and each one lives on his/her ethics. So,
we shall continue living that way and now stop arguing :(

Thanks :)

Nobody is arguing/flaming/fighting here. There is no animosity in any
of the discussions so far. Is there any rule in ILUGC which says a
conversation has to come to a conclusion or should be limited to less
than 10 replies.

If people feel this discussion carries no meaning to they are free to
ignore it. If see you are on Gmail, ignoring this discussion is just
two clicks away, I'm sure it's somewhat similar for others too.

I personally learnt quite a bit from this discussion. I feel, as long as it
is on topic, we need not stop a conversation midway.

And let us keep the animosity/flaming/fighting out of it.

It's the evolution of computer software isn't it. The time has come
people needn't depend on other's to kickstart their companies. Free
Software provides a platform for anyone in any corner of the world to
become the next mega-corporation provided the idea is brilliant
enough. It solves all the nitty-gritty problems that proprietary
licensed software used to cause allowing you to concentrate on your
'killer' idea.

OS/2 Warp was developed by IBM in collaboration with MS at a point
when MS had it's own OS in the market. Is that a good business move ?

History is the greatest teacher. It's always useful to refer to
history (examples in your case) to make sure one does not repeat
mistakes committed in the past.

Restricting technology to a select few goes against the Free Software
principles. If your idea is unique and brilliant enough it will
warrant a market of it's own. Having a minuscule idea/concept which
can be easily replicated and then going to market with it will lead to
failure both in the proprietary and FOSS business model. Technological
superiority and good-will in the market in which you operate will
always serve as a good yardstick on how well your business does. Other
factors count too. A case in point is the Firefox browser which though
is free and can be forked by anyone still manages to generate $70
million for the Mozilla Corporation which is just 20-30 employees in
strength.

Today we are debating about FOSS, tomorrow it could be some other
method to achieve freedom. The flexibility of a business to mold with
the changing times is what set's it apart. IBM seems to have learned
this and is doing very well.

RedHat 7.3 will run happily in 64 MB with XFree86, Abiword, and maybe
StarOffice 5.2. FC3 will run happily in 128 MB with X, Xfce, Abiword,
StarOffice 5.2 and maybe OOo-1.1.2/3. I have
smaller configurations (P100, 32 MB) running X/Xfce, but without any
of the *office stuff - use Abiword instead.

Yes, in economic discussions barriers to entry for new competitors is cited
as one of the main reasons for  anti-competitive behaviour by established
firms. OSS model makes the barrier to entry low enough to permit 'killer'
ideas to thrive on their merit.

Last time I tried Abiword it did not handle tables properly.

This is of course, one man's opinion. In another's (mine), Gnome sucks
big time while KDE's the best thing since sliced bread.

Ok. The topic diverges here. The question here is if the software is
my product or if my product depends on the software. For the former,
it is the nitty-gritty problems of proprietary software that can earn
us market share. On the other hand, If I merely depended on some
software to get my product going, FOSS helps me a lot. Remember I am
not selling FOSS but only my  product.

Well, maybe they didnt forsee windows 3 in the making!?
Again, OS/2 was an example I chose to use. But I have no clues onto
its origins. I am not interested either.

Duh, not a GNOME vs KDE flame again, we have had enough.

IMHO, the preference of desktop is individual's choice and I have seen 
both of them work well for an average joe's requirements. I personally 
(though have been using GNOME since I first installed GNU/Linux) never 
subscribe any particular desktop, just tell people what are all 
available and how each one looks. Then, I leave the decision to them.

Please refer the official PHP documentation at http://php.net  You
will find all answers there. Most of the data you require is present
in one of the PHP Predefined Variables[0].

Read the documentation and ask question if you face problems.

I'd have thought it to be a logical impossibility to show these on a

I think the OP is looking for uname -r, and not his distro's version.
"cat /proc/version" should also help.

It is a fact , not an opinion that KDE squeezes system resources much more than you can imagine. In fact even a simple kdict uses the same set of libraries that kstar and other utilies use and it takes a long time to load and work. It has nice eye candy, cutting edge features, special effects, especialy good integration with sound etc.

GNOME is not without its rough edges. Interface is boring and badly designed and lot of crashes and other problems.

However coming to the point, GNOME is at least 10 times faster than KDE and runs very well on old machines, that is all.

As root, open /boot/grub/menu.lst

Look for a line which says `timeout 10'

Change the value of 10 to the number of seconds of delay you want.

I am  happy that there have  been about 140+ responses  to my question
if the GPLv3 should include a royalty clause.

But, only  Richard Stallman wrote a relevant  answer, saying royalties
are incompatible with Free Software, and such a clause has no place in
the GPL.

I am afraid the  matter does not end there - there  is room in our law
to  explore that  area further.   Copyright law  is designed  with the
object of avoiding penury of  authors and promoting their welfare.  S.
53A introduced into our Copyright Act in 1995, says:

<quote>

53A. Resale share right in  original copies.-

(1) in the case  of resale for a price  exceeding ten thousand rupees,
    to the  original copy of a  painting, sculpture or  drawing, or of
    the original manuscipt  of a literary or dramatic  work or musical
    work, the author of such work  if he was the first owner of rights
    under  section 17 or  his legal  heirs shall,  notwithstanding any
    assignment of copyright in such work, have a right to share in the
    resale  price of such  original copy  or manuscript  in accordance
    with the provisions of this section:

    Provided that such right shall cease to exist on the expiration of
    the term of copyright in the work.

(2) The  share referred to  in sub-section  (1) shall  be such  as the
    Copyright Board may fix and the decision of the Copyright Board in
    this behalf shall be final:

    Provided  that the Copyright  Board may  fix different  shares for
    different classes of work:

    Provided  further that  in  co  case shall  the  share exceed  ten
    percent, of the resale price.

(3) If  any  dispute arises  regarding  the  right  conferred by  this
    section,  it  shall  be  referred  to the  Copyright  Board  whose
    decision shall be final.

</quote>

Now, it is quite possible to contend:

Under  Section 2(o)  of the  Copyright Act,  "literary  work" includes
computer   programs,  tables   and  compilations   including  computer
databases, and  under the GPL  and like free licenses,  every licensee
has the right  to resell copies for any price[1], and  if the price is
greater than  10,000/-, a  royalty is payable  even if the  author has
assigned the work.

AFAIK, such beneficial provisions cannot be contracted out or avoided.
If  the package  includes many  computer programs  written  by several
authors,  then,  probably  the  Copyright  Board may  decide  in  what
proportion the royalies are to be apportioned and paid.

If authors do not make claims to royalty either under the GPL or under
Section  53A,  then  it  indeed  shows their  magnanimity  and  strong
aversion to  copyrights - characterised  rightly as evil  by Macaulay.
Free Software developers releasing  their works under the GPL, legally
oblige lincensees to give back code  in return if they modify the work
- but never  any money.   The contributions and  donations in  cash or
kind are purely voluntary.

Free Software  is a charity  - let there  please not be  any confusion
about its  true nature.  The  author makes a voluntary  dedication and
any organisation  focused solely on  Free Software would largely  be a
charitable organisation.

For   example,  the   Free   Software  Foundation   is  a   charitable
organisation.     They    seek     donations    and    help    (visit:
http://www.gnu.org/help/donate.html)  to do  their work  and  carry on
with their mission.

AFAIK, FreeBSD,  Apache, PHP, PostgreSQL, OpenSSH, KDE,  GNOME are all
maintained by non-profit foundations.  There is no legal obligation to
pay them any  money, but a large number of donors  do donate either in
cash  or kind  or make  other kinds  of contributions  and  keep their
activities going.

After being generous and  charitable in substantially dedicating their
computer  programs under a  free license,  imo, it  is futile  to make
feeble attempts to  either collect royalties or license  fees over the
name assigned to  the computer program released under  a free license,
claiming it to be a "trademark".  The copyright gives very substantial
rights, and trademarks are  subsidary to those rights.  Trademarks are
proprietary  in nature,  and have  nothing to  do with  Free Software.
Suppose linux  kernel developers say, well redistribute  the code, but
do so without calling it 'linux',  then how would do market know it is
'linux' that  is being packaged and  sold?  It is quite  silly to make
such  claims and  such terms  and conditions  only tend  to  give Free
Software  a  false proprietary  color.   Every  time  a free  software
developer fall into the  "trademark" trap, the propreitary camp scores
a point.

There are a number of  legitimate ways of using trademarks, but naming
the computer program under a free  license with a trademark is not one
of them.

Every proprietary  business may  package and distribute  Free Software
with trademarks  that they may own  and license - but  that would have
nothing to do  with the Free Software in question.  I  do not have the
time or patience  to explain it here  - I would only say  those who do
not understand this would figure it out the hard way.

Every  question to  this list  is only  begging for  answers,  and the
replies, if useful and relevant, are certainly an act of charity.

I think I am not obliged to thank anyone here :)

sort file1 file2 | uniq -u

You'll lose the order of the lines, though - unless they are already sorted.

Other ways:

grep -v -f file1 file2 (Assumes file1 is the smaller of the two)
diff -u file1 file2 (You need to do some post-processing)

etc...

I am quite new here and this is my first opportunity to answer a question.
Vinodh and everyone here should excuse me , cause I may not have answers to
all your questions.

For booting, if you're using GRUB then changing the delay is easy.
You open /boot/grub/menu.lst in a text editor.(You need administrator
rights)
Find the following line:

timeout X

where X is some integer denoting the delay in seconds.
Change that, save the file and you're done.


Thanks for the opportunity. Hope your other problems are solved soon too.

Incorrect. 

It should be

$ sort file1 > tmpfile1
$ sort file2 > tmpfile2
$ comm -3 tmpfile1 tmpfile2

What version of dbus are you using? Press
Control+Alt+F1, login to console, and check output of
(if using debian):

 dpkg - l dbus

Try,

sudo /etc/init.d/dbus-1 stop; sleep 15; sudo
/etc/init.d/dbus-1 start

and try logging in again.

What I was really looking for was this page collecting throw-away

this one.

I had a slackware based box running on PIII processor with 64MB Ram.

You can try Vector Linux ( which is actually based on Slackware ).

Slackware has 'slapt-get' which is similar to apt-get for package
management.
Window manager is Xfce and word processor is Abi-Word.

Since everybody has decided that they are going to show-off , I
decided that I should not be left behind. So here's my uber-sleek and
sexy combination for a workable desktop on a 4-5 year old machine.

Distribution : Debian GNU/Linux (Testing) - The flexibility and small
install-footprint that Debian provides is unmatched till today by any
other distro. Ubuntu will throw a full-fledged GNOME desktop at your
paltry 64MB Ram and make it weep. Xubuntu is worth a try but if read
below on the alternate software I mention you will know why Debian is
the roXorZ. The other alternate is to have a low-footprint FC-install
with srpms which some people like Shiv do, for mortals like us,
there's Debian. :)

Window Manager : Blackbox or Openbox : If you are a keyboard-literate
guy (touch typing) go the Blackbox way, if not try Openbox.

Panel : pypanel : Lightweight, get's the job done and has a app-docking feature.

E-mail : sylpheed-claws : Gtk2 based and does IMAP and POP without any
problems and is light-weight. Memory footprint around 8MB. Take that
Evo!

Terminal emulator : mrxvt : A good name for this would have been
'gnome-terminal on steroids'. Has tabs, anti-aliased fonts and fully
extendable. And yes it does transparency too. :)

File Manager : pcmanfm : More usable than nautilus and get's the job
done when you want  actions like copy-pasting between folders. Think
Windows' Explorer minus the IE integration and you'll get the idea.

Browser : Epiphany : Dillo is an alternate if you don't want tabs and
not particular about Javascript.

Office : Evince : Install this with the MS-office plugins and you will
be able to view(only) all PDF's/PPT's/DOC's without any problem. For
editing office documents use Abiword+Gnumeric or try the SunOffice
suggestions which others have mentioned.

Hope it helps and do let us know about your final choice and how it went.

Insightful :-)

While the second law states the entropy of a 'closed' system always
increases, this proves even 'open' systems have to abide by this law!

No man, you are actually educating us and telling us the various options for doing various things. 

Keep up the good work Toufeeq!

I wouldn't use dillo even for a palmtop or handheld...

I like its speed and small footprint but it is not suitable for today's web. 

It can't handle frames,tables,css,javascript,ajax,ssl etc..

And this PC is really quite powerful. :-)

What makes me wonder is that this configuration is not at all low end.

So there is no need to restrict one's options so much. 

However this insight is most definitely appreciated.

Many of these things are quite new to me at least.

Give it a try. Each of the applications were carefully chosen after
months of searching. It's also enterprise ready. I use it everyday as
part of my workstation setup. Only differenence is I use Firefox
instead of Epiphany.

Hi Lugguies,

Any one here ever succeeded in installing and running a Windows guest
operating system in Xen 3.0 ?

I am already running few ubuntu and redhat guest machines in Xen 3.0 with
ubuntu as base OS and I am very impressed with the performance.

But for windows to run we need to have processors with virtualization
support, Intel calls it VT technology... (linux still runs on intel with out
VT technology), So before going in for a purchase of processors with VT
technology I just want to make sure that any one here ever able to install
and run windows guest operating system on Xen 3.0 base?

I have few VT enabled machines at my workplace lab and we have
installed windows domU, Xensource guys have a technical paper on
installing xen http://www.xensource.com/files/xen_install_windows.pdf

I guess you already know the reason why you need VTx enabled
processors to run windows.

What is it?

Wasn't there a problem because Xen requires the windows image to be modified
so that it can be a guest on Xen and M$ cried foul saying it flouted their
licence? And Xen has stopped supporting Windows since then?!

That has changed after Xen 3.0 started supporting h/w VT. What you are
referring to is pre Xen 3.0

Yup, Thats one of the primary reasons and differences between how
para/full virtualization works, windows domU can only be used in full
virtualization mode.

Xen and MSFT guys are working together to develop Interoperability :
http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=15221

I dont see any advantages for linux as such, microsoft can see the
heat and wants there customer to run para virtualized VM on top of
longhorn, xensource guys are helping them for obvious reasons. All x86
processor coming from intel/AMD will have VT/SVM in built, so i dont
see any issue of run windows on top of xen.

Thanks, Toufeeq & Amresh. I was under the mistaken notion that Windows won't
run on Xen and only Xen will run on an underlying Longhorn (when it is
released!)

Pardon my ignorance guys. I will end up shooting on my wrong foot if I end up saying something.

I have one question. Have any of you tried running Windoze under qemu emulation?

I know it will be slow but does it work? I mean if there are any gotchas or issues? What will be the practical use of doing such a thing?

Is Xen a much better alternative?

What about VMware?

Thanks in advance for enlightening me.

Yes, it does but is really very slow, there is a list of issue with
scheduling in qemu and enumerating device has a huge overhead. qemu is
really very useful for tiny OS :)-. ms dos 6.2 would rock.
There is a binary with qemu maintained by the qemu _maintainer_ which
helps in improving the performance, but has other issues and he never
wanted that to be GPL'd.

Xen, can use qemu and there is a lot of development going around with
xen. Lot of big vendors are banking on xen, but i would still say its
not completely enterprise ready. It  will take some time and i hope
they will be part of kernel.org someday.


> What about VMware?

VMware rulez :)-, vmware also has a initiative to go opensource, there
has a VMI proposed and there was lot of discussion at linux symposium.
vmware guys are also hoping to part of mainline kernel as well. Rusty
Russel is pushing patches and testing them.

vmware has lot of free as in bear and commercial products which are
very mature for enterprise customers.

If that notebook is still under warranty, sending it to gateway is the
only option you got.

Having any other non gateway entity poke into the notebook is going to
invalidate your laptop's warranty.

It is. I got it in May.

I have actually don't that. Well, there is no seal or anything like. So I am
just hoping I don't :-(

I have to ship it Gateway. They can ship it back to some US address only.
And someone has to ship it back. I didn't want to take the route and I was
hoping ABM could fix it.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0610190142200.8552@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,

I need to view the log file in a unix box. The log file will keep on
getting updated as it is a production box.

Earlier I used the "tail -f " option to see the last part of the file.
That showed the latest update in the file continuously whenever the file
got updated.

Now if I want to see the log file going up and down I am not able to see
using the 'tail -f' command as it would only show the latest tail portion.

Is there some way to open a continuously getting updated file(such as
production log file) in 'vi' editor so that I can go up and down the page
of the file. At the same time the file/buffer should also get updated with
the latest changes(may be by key press like ctrl-R or similar) but without
the need to close and open the file.

Also How can I open multiple file by spliting the vi screen(without using
splitvt tool) so that I can see and scroll different log files
simultaneoulsy in a single screen and in a single session.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks.

less /var/log/messages

and then the 'F' command emulates tail -f. If you want to stop the
emulation (and scroll backwards, for example), then control-C and 'b'
to go backwards. When you are done, 'F' again.

If vim, then vim -o file1 file2

You are better off writing a vim script. I just took a look at it and looks simple to me. But unfortuately I have not written one for your need. If you need help please let me know. I may be able to do it. But you can too! :-)

vim 7.0 has a nice tabbed feature.

$vim -p file1 file2

And you can very easily switch between tabs using "gt" hotkey.

i.e, press g followed by t in command mode. 

It is really hard explaining vi in English. :-)

If you don't have 7.0, it is very easy to compile it urself. It has few other nice features as well. Just a straight configure make make install works.

Best,

Dear Friends,

I am working with dapper drake 6.06 LTS. Amazing  installation process with
the same CD , but this time with a different machine ,dell latitude d620. I
can do my installation on the fly, but with the same media the installation
failed with the older 845/865/d101ggc motherboards. As of now i am not in a
position to buy the point the installation failure is due to Media error.
Your esteemed comments on this..

Cheers

Good to hear it worked out, so its not Media Error and more than that 
Dapper Drake got installed in a fly :)

Suggestion: In your *old* machine, with the same Dapper CD, run a 
memtest. The options can be selected when the initial screen pops up 
after you boot from the CD, offering you the choices to install, etc.

Try with the alternate install cd, use text mode.

BTW - updated to edgy yesterday.  I _love_ (or not) its habit of
renaming all the partitions in fstab with uuid=[some long string]

That way - with lvm / mdadm setup on my box, it couldnt detect my
partitions and so a running kernel wouldnt boot.  Had to modify
mdadm.conf to ROOT=/dev/hda1 instead of ROOT=probe and then run mkinitrd
to get myself a fresh initrd for that kernel (the old 2.6.15.7 from dapper).

Blazing fast startup though, I'll give it that.

Thanks but I still have some doubts. Perhaps it is because I don't have experience.

And the fact that VMware is not free makes things worse for me.

Anyway pretty soon I am going to try both qemu and xen.

I am hoping that kqemu makes things a little bit faster.

Stepwise instructions - to view Unicode Tamil text

1. You need to have Unicode Tamil fonts installed on your computer and the
Operating System capable of rendering Tamil Scripts. Windows XP comes with a
Unicode Tamil Font (Latha) and you need not download/install a unicode font.
2. In the Control Panel, in Regional/Languages Options you will need to
ensure that Indic/Asian Language option is checked.
3. Use a browser that is capable of handling UTF-8 based pages (Netscape 6,
Internet Explorer 5) with the Unicode Tamil font chosen as the default font
for the UTF-8 char-set/encoding view. Unicode Tamil Fonts may be downloaded
from http://www.tamilnation.org/fonts/latha.ttf

Friends.

Today, I installed Debian etch testing.
Wow. it has got a gui installer.
we have to type "installgui" at booting from cd.

Raman gave me 16 cds.
Thanks sir.

I added the 16 cds.
IT gave me a lot of applications.

I added all the multimedia hacks from debian-multimedia.org repoitory.

I have to create those packages from that site as an
additional CD.

So that I can give the 17 cds to my friends
in my native place kanchipuram.

there, net is still a wonder only.
Dialup always kills.

No other distro satisfied the needs of a guy there.
I hope now debian fills up everything.

This weekend, we will celebrate Diwali with Debian.

Long live Debian.

Diwali wishes for all.

Use Synaptic Package Manager to install the required
fonts: ttf-tamil-fonts, ttf-indic-fonts.

Just check whether the encoding of the browser is set to Unicode (UTF-8).
This should help resolving the issue.

@ http://www.tamilnation.org/ u can find more links to download unicode
fonts.

Stepwise instructions - to view Unicode Tamil text

1. You need to have Unicode Tamil fonts installed on your computer and the
Operating System capable of rendering Tamil Scripts. Windows XP comes with a
Unicode Tamil Font (Latha) and you need not download/install a unicode font.
2. In the Control Panel, in Regional/Languages Options you will need to
ensure that Indic/Asian Language option is checked.
3. Use a browser that is capable of handling UTF-8 based pages (Netscape 6,
Internet Explorer 5) with the Unicode Tamil font chosen as the default font
for the UTF-8 char-set/encoding view. Unicode Tamil Fonts may be downloaded
from http://www.tamilnation.org/fonts/latha.ttf

Message-ID: <9a9bfc170610200420p9147c80w306ebee843a169ac@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I use Debian testing, with an occasional package taken from unstable.
Aptitude shows the packages which have shown up since the last update
in a separate section called `New Packages'. Now, the trouble is this:
I want unstable to be in sources.list so that I can updates to the one
or two packages I draw from unstable, but I want to see what's new
only in testing, as it would give me some level of assurance about the
stability of the package. Any suggestions?

it moves on...

It is just plug and play. 

Connect it to the ethernet port of your system, open a
browser and you can configure the modem.

Where do I get the MS-office plugins? (The Evince website seems to put

 I use Huawei WA 1003a. It works fine when used with the ethernet port in
any linux distro. But when it comes to USB, there are some
issues.Thechipset is a eagle-usb
chipset.In Ubuntu the modem gets detected out of the box....and i just had
to enter the DNS to get my net working ...whereas in FC5 it needed some
fixing..(though i havent fixed it yet). Im not sure of the 841MT. This one
has a ethernet port, a USB and a wifi.

This one give a good info on Huawei WA 1003a:

I use the Huawei WA1003 (Quidway). Great box for the price Rs. 1,800/-. 
Works on ethernet and Wifi well on Linux. I've found it more stable than 
DLink or Linksys - meaning reboots are required far less often. If you 
are in the habit of turning off the box everyday, you should have no 
issues. Continuous use of a week leads to hanging sometimes. DLink would 
do so every 4-6 hours. Linksys was a little better. This behaviour has 
nothing to do with Linux though.

I suggest that you do not use BSNL's DNS servers as they go down pretty 
often. I use OpenDNS service and it is very stable.

Usually when I meet students, and professionals, their usual concern and complaint is that most companies here in India do menial service work that rots their brain cells and kills the spark. The conversation usually continues to say that, how they wish they could work in a better environment on something that will induce and encourage creativity and do more than porting of code, management of some old project, migration of data, or do support work for the running of some services.
  Do people really mean that? I am not sure.
  For those of you who arent aware by now, I work with the Indian Institute of Technology and with the TeNET group. TeNeT in some sense, doesn't come under IIT's direct jurisdiction, though it avails of all the benefits, and has a lot of potential for growth. I am working on putting together a team that would form what I would like to call the TeNET Labs. There are a lot of companies such as Google and Microsoft, all the big players in the Industry who want to align with IIT and do some collaborative work. The task of this team would be to work with them and see what we can build. You'll get a chance of your lifetime to work with some amazing people, and be part of a simple rule : we don't do services work, and everything we do will be qualified as innovative and aimed towards patenting. In otherwords, you will have to be creative.
  Compensations can be matched, and there is the priviledge of working to solve some amazing problems that will impact, perhaps the entire population in drastic ways.
  Do you think after explaining all this it is easier to find good talent? Most are very reluctant to give up their service jobs and come take this up full time. I understand that it might sound scary and hence am offering them a one year contract.

I don't know what you really mean to say here.

I personally have refrained from making pointed remarks at any organization/individual/group in ILUGC so far.

But I think I will have to butt in here. Please don't get offended.

Anyway to answer your question perhaps you are right. That people really don't mean that. Because from whatever I have seen so far what people want in India is to buy a car/house and settle in life with a cushy job. A guaranteed monthly income that gives them some sort of snob value more than anything else and also certain foreign trips thrown into the bargain.

So if you give people all these things and along with that also some sexy work then they are ready. Otherwise not.

Nobody recognizes that great things don't come to them in a plate.

If you pass exams by studying just the previous night, then you forget even before the exam is over. Of course you will get good marks but in life you end up being a zero.

Why? Because no endeavor is done in the short term.

All great achievements are a result of several months and years of hard work, toil and sacrifice.

What to talk of sacrifice in the Indian context?

Our hearts have run dry of such noble and immensely practical ideas.

Perhaps this has to do with a silly Westernisation that is happening of late.

We take all the evil from them but coolly leave out the good points...

TeNeT in some sense, doesn't come under IIT's direct jurisdiction, though it avails of all the benefits, and has a lot of potential for growth. I am working on putting together a team that would form what I would like to call the TeNET Labs. There are a lot of companies such as Google and Microsoft, all the big players in the Industry who want to align with IIT and do some collaborative work.

I can't agree with any of this. :-) Let me leave it at that.

Yes, I agree that you get some product development experience that perhaps you cannot get anywhere in India, most definitely not in Bangalore.

I am really very very sorry to be doing this. I know how much hurt I am causing you but I am more or less forced to do it since you can't make omelettes without breaking eggs...

Can you please elaborate what innovative, creative and larger than life endeavor you are going to do?

Aren't you aware that the most reputed TeNET company has not been paying its employees the salary on time? 

Sorry. I couldn't help myself.

If you want to build a great institution first make sure that you pay people properly and that you really mean  what you talk.

If you pay peanuts you get monkeys.

All the best!

Again I repeat. No offence meant. If there is an iota of falsehood in what I say you are more than welcome to hit me back.

Please be calm and respond with a cool head. 

Don't bring emotions into this.

I use KMobileTools or Wammy to send SMS.  I have never used the java
SMSlib but if you want to start from scratch, the following should
help.

If you are using bluetooth to connect the mobile to the pc, then you
would need to install the packages matching "bluez", "obex" and
kbluetooth.  A step-by-step guide is at
http://www.integrasoftware.it/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=84&Itemid=2
Once rfcomm is set up, KMobileTools (or others) could be set up using
/dev/rfcomm0 to send SMS or use other mobile services.  Of course,
simple file transfers could be done using obex utilities, like the K
Bluetooth OBEX Client, even without rfcomm setup, but for SMS and few
others, it is a must.

Just a friendly advice from a brother. Well, I am both a friend and brother. :-)

If you work at night, your system loses synch and everything becomes topsy turvy. Many youngsters don't realize this but in the long run it will have disastrous consequences.

If you want to work hard and smart I suggest go to bed early and get up early. Not that it works for me since I mostly wake up late but this is the only solution to putting in more hours of hard work.

In intellectual endeavors like what we people are upto it is very important that the mind stays fresh. Or else we will be working hard and not smartly.

Again IWFM but YMMV. You are warned.

I make sure that whatever I work on tingles my bones and flesh and hopefully also titillates my emotions. That way any amount of hard work will only be pleasure for me.

I have developed a habit of doing some other work in lieu of the main work and that is how I relax. This is the best way to relax as you get both work done.

Reduce talking to people. Helps save a great deal of mental and physical energy.

And of course stay away from women as much as possible. This is an advice for students and bachelors of course. :-)

If you are a woman stay away from men. :-)

Ensure that you do yoga, swimming, jogging or something to keep your body strong and healthy. Prayer and meditation also help a great deal.

If you fall sick, everyone who depends on you suffer, not only you.

TTTT the last time I fell sick was more than 10 months ago. 

In order not to get mood swings or laziness I suggest yoga.

There are particular asanas that work for me. sirsasana,matsyasana and padmasana come to mind. However they are very very difficult to do for non vegetarians and people with untrained physique.

But it is only by controlling the body that you control the mind. 

Now, don't start arguing about this or start a flame war. You know I am in no mood to argue. :-)

Be serious about your work but be very very casual and humorous with the peole you interact. Without humor no relationship, no work, no endeavor can succeed beyond a point.

I can go on but I am no corporate or MBA guy! 

Just a friend/brother. 

love,
Girish

Thank you very much and i will try to follow what would work for me
 And so nice of you for all the advices.

Basically i am just trying to squeeze my schedules and contribute to the
projects.
For two reasons.

1. I am really interested in doing something which is original
2. I attended your speech ( on data transmission security ) and am impressed
on the intellectual richness of the talk.

I am really keen in participating in the projects if the terms are a bit
flexible.Compensation doesn't really matter.

BTW could you pl list / outline the project you are planning

I want to send alert mail from one of our server. The
sendmail version is 8.13. I just gave the relay host
(DS) entry in the in /etc/mail/sendmail.cf to one of
our primary mail server. When I send a mail from cmd
line using mail command like 
#mail -v -s "test" user@domain.com 
The mail is sent with the MAIL FROM header as
<username@.>. It is not adding the hostname after the
@. and gives the error as "Invalid hostname".
But if I send mail with the recipient address in mail
cmd, the mail is sent.
#mail -v -s "test" -r localuser@mydomain.com
user@domain.com 

How to make sendmail to add the hostname. The same
type of configuration I am running in another server
that is running sendmail 8.11, which is working.

Try the masquerade domain or always use domain name settings in 
sendmail.cf. See http://www.sendmail.org/m4/features.html

Hi,

Thanks for the efforts and update.

It would be nice if you could add the SCIM installation files with Tables
related to indic packages also seperately inside a folder. (SCIM gets
installed upon installating Ubuntu but the packages *
"scim-tables-additional"* with its dependency *"scim-modules-table"* do
not get installed by default). These contains the keyboard layouts of SCIM
for typing in Indian Languages. Also would request you to put the Remington
keyboard layout's source installation file developed by AUKBC-NRCFOSS for
Tamil.

If it is already available in Ubuntu Mirror please guide us.

The Synaptic Package Manager may not be a viable option for users who do not
have internet conectivity. If these files are made available for download,
then users can make a one time download from elsewhere and use the same in
their PC.

I am not handling the mirror directly. However, if the package is
available in Ubuntu repositories, it should be in our repo as well.
The scim packages seem to be there.

As already said, if you specify what the exact files are, then someone
in campus can get them for you.

Now that we have a local mirror, would it be possible
for anyone to bring their PC or laptop, and connect to
the LAN on campus, say during a meet, and
install/update Ubuntu using the mirror?

There might be students who cannot afford an Internet
connection, but have done a basic single Ubuntu
CD-install, and require new software to be installed.

Time for an install-fest, perhaps?

Appreciate any thoughts/comments on this,

Thanks,

SK

Um, provided we can get a LAN plug at the meetup venue. I am not sure
if the ADI TeNeT seminar hall has a LAN plug; can Bharathi please
confirm?

Well now the instructions are different. Yank my script to a file that you call say tailtab.vim or something. The name really doesnt matter.

Now, execute these steps as a normal user.

$mkdir -p ~/.vim/plugin
$cp tailtab.vim ~/.vim/plugin

Now, just fire up vim 

$vim

Inside vim, type :TailView /var/log/messages /var/log/mail.log

to view these two files in separate tabs.

But system files are usually not allowed for viewing by normal users. I leave it an exercise what you have to do. :-)

TailView is to be entered in : mode just like :wq .

I am sure you get the idea.

Now, you can simultaneously edit another file since this plugin opens new tabs. Doesn't overwrite existing ones.

Press Ctrl-R to reload the file. You can of course at any time add new log files for monitoring using the TailTab command.

Of course you can use the usual TAB key for filename completion. :-)

Enjoy!

regards,
Girish

PS:- The file is 50 lines, so if you pay me 20$ per line, then it works out to 1000$. Send a check and support a poor hacker! :-)

Hi all,
    I have a scenario where my perl program has to find the IP address 
of the machine.  I didn't know how to achieve this in perl (yet to look 
cpan though), so i tried doing it through shell commands.  The usual way 
we do it is by 'ifconfig'  and here is how i achieved that,

       `/sbin/ifconfig | grep inet | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's#addr:##g'`


If anyone of you could achieve this, through a simple means, plz let me 
know.

Another method:

  /sbin/ifconfig eth0 | awk '/inet addr/ {print $2}' |
cut -d: -f2

Dear friends
I am coming to  you in search of any guidance/ lead on doing  the following
task in drupal 4.7.3.
my task is now to customize a site with a login page followed by two content
page.The first content page will look like
http://www.penguinprogress.org/layout.PNG which will house a sitemap column
where there will be various Headings like taxonomy1 taxonomy2 taxonomy3....
in the menu system. In a scenario when the user clicks taxonomy2 , the site
map changes as in the picture
http://www.penguinprogress.org/layout2.PNGwhere all the submenu of
taxonomy2 (sub section 1, sub section 2, sub
section 3) are  displayed.

For developing such work, can any body throw a pointer of how to do it,
probably a url to the tutorial is appreciated. I have googled, but other
than nick lewis tutorial i cant find any thing closer. Any lead on this
please..

Thanking you,

Sincerely

RS.

The only problem that I see is that, if one of the team members goes on flexible timings, or works on a different schedule, then it throws away the uniformity of the rest of the team members and collaborating becomes a major task for me. As it is, I am working way too many weekends, which I would very much like to avoid.

I would prefer people fulltime, if you can understand my reasons. Also, in terms of projects, it is good to get your hands wet with some project and then diversify, as that way the talent is proven and reliable, and can be expected of some deliverable. Focus becomes a key issue when money and effort are spent.

Hope that makes sense.

If anything else, shoot me an email at vijay <at> vijayanand.name

Just a friendly advice from a brother. Well, I am both a friend and brother. :-)

If you work at night, your system loses synch and everything becomes topsy turvy. Many youngsters don't realize this but in the long run it will have disastrous consequences.

If you want to work hard and smart I suggest go to bed early and get up early. Not that it works for me since I mostly wake up late but this is the only solution to putting in more hours of hard work.

In intellectual endeavors like what we people are upto it is very important that the mind stays fresh. Or else we will be working hard and not smartly.

Again IWFM but YMMV. You are warned.

I make sure that whatever I work on tingles my bones and flesh and hopefully also titillates my emotions. That way any amount of hard work will only be pleasure for me.

I have developed a habit of doing some other work in lieu of the main work and that is how I relax. This is the best way to relax as you get both work done.

Reduce talking to people. Helps save a great deal of mental and physical energy.

And of course stay away from women as much as possible. This is an advice for students and bachelors of course. :-)

If you are a woman stay away from men. :-)

Ensure that you do yoga, swimming, jogging or something to keep your body strong and healthy. Prayer and meditation also help a great deal.

If you fall sick, everyone who depends on you suffer, not only you.

TTTT the last time I fell sick was more than 10 months ago. 

In order not to get mood swings or laziness I suggest yoga.

There are particular asanas that work for me. sirsasana,matsyasana and padmasana come to mind. However they are very very difficult to do for non vegetarians and people with untrained physique.

But it is only by controlling the body that you control the mind. 

Now, don't start arguing about this or start a flame war. You know I am in no mood to argue. :-)

Be serious about your work but be very very casual and humorous with the peole you interact. Without humor no relationship, no work, no endeavor can succeed beyond a point.

I can go on but I am no corporate or MBA guy! 

Just a friend/brother. 

love,
Girish

Thank you very much and i will try to follow what would work for me
 And so nice of you for all the advices.

Basically i am just trying to squeeze my schedules and contribute to the
projects.
For two reasons.

1. I am really interested in doing something which is original
2. I attended your speech ( on data transmission security ) and am impressed
on the intellectual richness of the talk.

I am really keen in participating in the projects if the terms are a bit
flexible.Compensation doesn't really matter.

BTW could you pl list / outline the project you are planning

Regards

I want to send alert mail from one of our server. The
sendmail version is 8.13. I just gave the relay host
(DS) entry in the in /etc/mail/sendmail.cf to one of
our primary mail server. When I send a mail from cmd
line using mail command like 
#mail -v -s "test" user@domain.com 
The mail is sent with the MAIL FROM header as
. It is not adding the hostname after the
@. and gives the error as "Invalid hostname".
But if I send mail with the recipient address in mail
cmd, the mail is sent.
#mail -v -s "test" -r localuser@mydomain.com
user@domain.com 

How to make sendmail to add the hostname. The same
type of configuration I am running in another server
that is running sendmail 8.11, which is working.

Try the masquerade domain or always use domain name settings in 
sendmail.cf. See http://www.sendmail.org/m4/features.html

The trouble is not with finding out where the package is from,  but
from making it hidden from the UI. One option is to choose a default
package limit of "~Atesting", but when I ask aptitude to forget the
new packages list, it will forget all packages, even those from
unstable. This means that I would never get to see them as New
Packages when they migrate from unstable to testing...

it moves on...

Well, a given machine could have several different IP addresses, so
you need to be a bit more specific than that.

Modification of GPL'ed code or even mixing it with proprietary code when 
no redistribution to a third party happens is a right of use that is 
granted by the license. The restrictions only kick in when 
redistribution happens.

Not necessarily. Example: Mozilla Corporation.

Copyrights like trademarks are also designed to give the authors 
monopoly rights. Its balanced by licenses which grant broader rights to 
users. So its not quite meaningful to disclaim trademarks as proprietary.

Trademarks are source identifiers. . There is a limited amount of "fair 
use" rights which would prevent the Linux kernel developers from 
outright prohibiting end users from calling it "Linux". So such a 
scenario is legally impossible.

There are a number of well known Free software projects which enforce 
trademarks strongly and they have very good reasons to do so. This 
include preventing abuse. A Free software program is determined by the 
copyright license and not the trademarks.

There are both multi homed and single interface having mutiple IP addresses problem.

You have to basically figure out which network you have to cater to if you are a server. If you are a client (which is unlikely in this case), then I guess there is not much of an issue

Anyway that said you can make do with the manual approach for most common cases(the script i sent)

Stepwise instructions - to view Unicode Tamil text

1. You need to have Unicode Tamil fonts installed on your computer and 
the Operating System capable of rendering Tamil Scripts. Windows XP 
comes with a Unicode Tamil Font (Latha) and you need not 
download/install a unicode font.
2. In the Control Panel, in Regional/Languages Options you will need to 
ensure that Indic/Asian Language option is checked.
3. Use a browser that is capable of handling UTF-8 based pages (Netscape 
6, Internet Explorer 5) with the Unicode Tamil font chosen as the 
default font for the UTF-8 char-set/encoding view. Unicode Tamil Fonts 
may be downloaded from here. <http://www.tamilnation.org/fonts/latha.ttf>

There are also NAT, multicasting, hot-standby protocols like
VRRP/CARP, load-balancing etc. that causes an IP address to be
associated with a given machine.

The point is that an IP address is not a property of the machine, so a
question like "how do I figure out the OP address of a machine?" is
meaningless. IP addresses are properties of TCP/IP connections, not of
machines/computers/hardware.

Given that, the way to figure out IP addresses at both ends of a
connection are the pair of system calls getsockname/getpeername
(perldoc -f for their usage details).

Did you compile in PPP support ?
I'm guessing you need that for PPPoE.

Make sure CONFIG_PPP is set.

Yes I agree but practically there is no need to complicate things so much.

If you trunk,bridge,vlan or carp your interface then your IP address cannot be determined easily but AFAIK ifconfig should work.

I must be wrong, if so please correct.

Can you tell me how NAT and multicasting affect this? Or did you mean something else? Anyway that is not important.

IP address is assigned either manually, by DHCP,PPP,PPPoX etc...

NAT afffects connections to the external world. Ok now I get what you mean.

If you run a server from inside a NATed machine, then you got to port forward it and your RFC1918 address really doesn't matter...

Now, what about multicasting? Sorry I don't know.

All this is fine and dandy but getpeername() works very well practically.

getsockname() doesn't. Try it and you will know what I mean.

It always returns 0.0.0.0 for INADDR_ANY. Now, if you bind it manually then you don't need this call in the first place...

I think this is a recognized defect in the design. Hence the need to put hacks like ifconfig.

Guys,

I created a lot of noise in misc@openbsd over this trivial issue.

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=openbsd-misc&m=116167876510367&w=2

And no one could give a proper solution. There are couple of possibilities , none of them elegant.

1) http://libdnet.sourceforge.net/
2)

in_addr_t 
defip(in_addr_t dst)
{
	int s, slen = sizeof(struct sockaddr);
	struct sockaddr_in sin;

	s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP);
	if (s < 0) {
		perror("socket");
		return -1;
	}
	memset(&sin, 0, sizeof(sin));
	sin.sin_family = AF_INET;
	sin.sin_port = htons(60);
	memcpy(&sin.sin_addr.s_addr, (char *)&dst, sizeof(in_addr_t));
	if (connect(s, (struct sockaddr *)&sin, sizeof(struct sockaddr)) < 0) {
		perror("connect");
		return -1;
	}
	if (getsockname(s, (struct sockaddr *)&sin, &slen) < 0)
		return -1;
	close(s);

	return (sin.sin_addr.s_addr);
}

The best and most interesting one of course is using getifaddrs(3) system call but it is too complex to use and only available on *BSD systems. There is something similar for linux. Too bad I don't recollect now.

The explanation for the above code is attached snipped from an e-mail from Germany personally sent to me.

<<<<<<<cut>>>>>
The process of defip() is pretty well as you described only difference is       
that the UDP socket gets connected.  This doesn't change any functionality      
of a UDP socket except that the socket will now listen to ICMP unreach          
messages and return an error upon the next write/read if such was received.     
(Since UDP sockets can't really be connected.. they're stateless).              
<<<<<<<cut>>>>>
                                                                    

But as I said I don't like this. :-)

Kenneth,

Great work and thanks for the update.

I felt it would be better if the examples cited are represented in Tamil 
letters.. say it would be better if "maram" is replaced by ????.

avarkalY is replaced by  ???????


Please do the needful. Am eager to know if any other meaningful 
intention is there behind putting the examples in romanic representation.

Hats off to AUKBC again.

Regards.

Stepwise instructions - to view Unicode Tamil text

1. You need to have Unicode Tamil fonts installed on your computer and 
the Operating System capable of rendering Tamil Scripts. Windows XP 
comes with a Unicode Tamil Font (Latha) and you need not 
download/install a unicode font.
2. In the Control Panel, in Regional/Languages Options you will need to 
ensure that Indic/Asian Language option is checked.
3. Use a browser that is capable of handling UTF-8 based pages (Netscape 
6, Internet Explorer 5) with the Unicode Tamil font chosen as the 
default font for the UTF-8 char-set/encoding view. Unicode Tamil Fonts 
may be downloaded from here. <http://www.tamilnation.org/fonts/latha.ttf>

The FC guys need to crank up their hype-machine. When Ubuntu released
, they whole geek-world was talking about it. Look at the way FC6 (a
very good release going by the features) gets released. Hardly any
noise.

I remember the same thing happened when RedHat was a free(gratis)
distro and each RH release was welcomed by huge fanfare and every
Slackware release was greeted by dead-silence.

Ubuntu zealotry on display, ladies and gentlement. :)

Keep up the good work ubunteros(or whatever you guys call your clan).

Just saw this on Google trends. Though I don't take Google's words as
the final one, it is interesting. In two years Ubuntu has managed to
overshadow Fedora.

Dear ILUGC,

I just installed Fedora Core 6, mainly to try out AIGLX + Compiz, and
I must say it works like a charm on my Pentium - 4 3 GHz with 512 MB
RAM (Intel 915 with no extra video card).

As for other features, the installer is very intuitive and easy to
understand. However, during first boot, it asks one question about
SELinux, which could have been avoided esp. keeping new users in mind.

One thing I did not like, was the fact that the installer made no
attempt whatsoever to detect the presence of other operating systems
on my computer (which happens to be Debian GNU/Linux). So, the GRUB
has only Fedora Core. I had to manually add entries for the other
operating systems.

I have the ISOs for the five CDs. If you need CDs, please mail me off list.

Anything would do, BTW don't opt for the standard installation process 
in any distro, customize.  In which case, Ubuntu might not be the 
choice--the only bad thing about it.

Out goes Compiz, in comes Beryl. Check this out. Beryl is way too
good. You can take my word as I have used both Compiz and Beryl.

To my knowledge its a way of representing "parts of speech" of various
languages...

I may not be correct also...

Thats all i have heard..

Grammarians and Linguists should know better...

Stepwise instructions - to view Unicode Tamil text

1. You need to have Unicode Tamil fonts installed on your computer and the
Operating System capable of rendering Tamil Scripts. Windows XP comes with a
Unicode Tamil Font (Latha) and you need not download/install a unicode font.

2. In the Control Panel, in Regional/Languages Options you will need to
ensure that Indic/Asian Language option is checked.
3. Use a browser that is capable of handling UTF-8 based pages (Netscape 6,
Internet Explorer 5) with the Unicode Tamil font chosen as the default font
for the UTF-8 char-set/encoding view. Unicode Tamil Fonts may be downloaded
from http://www.tamilnation.org/fonts/latha.ttf

Hi All.

   I'm using RHEL-3 system in that i installed LAMP(apache-1.3.37,
mysql-4.1.18,php-4.1.30). i enabled JPEG in
[root@vasu php-4.4.2]# pwd

Suggest me how to ENABLE JPEG in the above mentioned LAMP versions & tell me
is there any compatibility with the version else JPEG will support in

He's right. People get that excited only if they really find something

That's nothing unexpected. I know many people who don't use Ubuntu
simply because they don't have Internet access. Ubuntu comes with only
one CD and it's quite painful to install extra software like multimedia
codecs on Ubuntu of you don't have Internet.
Other distributions like Fedora & OpenSUSE come with 4-5 CDs which
contain most of the available software and thus are used by many people.
The situation obviously changes with countries or regions with good
Internet availability, though.
That said, Fedora is an excellent distribution on its own but may be it
lacks a vibrant community which Ubuntu enjoys.

BG

Don't quite agree. The thing is people get drawn into Linux for two reasons.

1. They get influenced by the local LUG or friends in wich case they
end up using what is the popular distro. In today's case it would be
Ubuntu.

2. A lot of people start using the distro which they get "trained" in.
This includes people in training institutes, colleges and offices. The
offices usually use FC as most of the production-linux-work happens on
RHEL and FC would be the default distro choice for trainees and
non-production usage.

Though I agree that Internet connectivity does hold back enthusiastic
users, I don't think many normal-users of Ubuntu would like to have
the complete repositories at their disposal. Also, with the presence
of DVD's this should not be a problem. Doesn't Ubuntu provide DVD
images ?

May be you are right. I can notice that there is still a lot of inertia
about Red Hat (& Fedora) in colleges and around people who have heard
about some sort of GNU/Linux distribution in the past. Many people have
asked me for Red Hat 9 CDs and a lot of them are using Red Hat 13 or 14
(which is actually Fedora Core <something>). Somehow the name Red Hat
seems to have a lot of appeal attached to it ;)
That said, installing software on Ubuntu on a machine without Internet
is still painful. Personally I won't recommend Ubuntu to a college
student without Internet access because I know that he will invariably
need something which is not provided in Ubuntu CD and then will hit a
brick wall. Fedora is slightly better in those cases as the 4-5 CDs
contain a lot of software and libraries which can be easily installed as
and when needed.

Yes, people who need only a web browser, an email client and a messaging
application will be more than happy with the Ubuntu CD (that's in fact
the target audience of the CD). But there are _some_ people (students,
educators mainly) who will need more things, like a DBMS engine, a Web
Server, may be some C library, GNU Emacs, or something else which is not
provided in the CD. In those cases lack of connectivity is a major
problem. The DVD, btw doesn't do much as it doesn't contain the full
main repositories. It is a combined installed for Ubuntu, Kubuntu, etc.
in both text and GUI modes.
We are actually thinking about creating an extra CD with essential
packages not already provided in the CD. There is a preliminary list of
packages to be included on the wiki page
http://ubuntu-in.org/wiki/Ubuntu_IN_Extra_CD. You all are welcome to add
 to it. Once we reach a critical mass, then we will create the CD and
put up for distribution through various channels.

Thanks! I have been lurking for a week or so. I am very happy to be a
part of one of the most active GLUGs in the country. Rock on!

Do a Debian base installation and then apt-get install <blah..blah> 
which ensures better performance on low end machines (I did it with my

Let me not get into which is best.. Fedora or Ubuntu.. Both need to 
encouraged.. If fedora has flaws please take efforts to get that flaw 
out.. If Ubuntu has flaws i would like to convey we are one small 
recognised LocoTeam who can take some efforts atleast...

Well, if internet conectivity and download features are criterias for an 
OS to flourish, how did windows florish? (Offcourse Piracy is the best 
possible answer)

Remember, Windows OS alone is provided any where.  U need to stretch to 
get Office Suite. U need to  make efforts to get real player work in 
windows.  One has to  do much much much more to configure an IIS up and 
running...

Look on the other hand Ubuntu comes with most  common applications a 
normal  user can expect.  And always  mirrors are readily available and 
the  LUGs  like us.

Also the complete satisfaction that I am gonna stretch for a Legal Copy 
of a G(PL)enuine Software and not a pirated version of a proprietory 
one... We beleive these reasons are enough to convince users...

Its a matter of time before the most commonly required softwares for 
Ubuntu is made available to public (through any means).. The seperate CD 
move of Ubuntu Indian Team is a good move towards this...

Stepwise instructions - to view Unicode Tamil text

1. You need to have Unicode Tamil fonts installed on your computer and 
the Operating System capable of rendering Tamil Scripts. Windows XP 
comes with a Unicode Tamil Font (Latha) and you need not 
download/install a unicode font.
2. In the Control Panel, in Regional/Languages Options you will need to 
ensure that Indic/Asian Language option is checked.
3. Use a browser that is capable of handling UTF-8 based pages (Netscape 
6, Internet Explorer 5) with the Unicode Tamil font chosen as the 
default font for the UTF-8 char-set/encoding view. Unicode Tamil Fonts 
may be downloaded from here. <http://www.tamilnation.org/fonts/latha.ttf>

Slackware is the best for PC's with fewer configuration. But installation
and configuring X is a bit tweaky at times.

System requirements for slackware.

I just wanted to know is there any light weight Ubuntu distro available?

You have a conservative system, so I'd really suggest you use the
whole disk space to be sure that you won't have disk space crunches
later.

As for Linux distros, I have managed to run Debian Sarge on a P-III
733 MHz with 56 MB RAM. Which means that you may even be able to run
KDE/GNOME (if you are adventurous) using Sarge. Plus, the Debian
advantage of having all packages at your disposal with APT.

Slackware also ran very well on a similar configuration without many
hiccups. It should also satisfy most of the needs of any programmer
and casual user who knows his/her way around configuration...

But the best way is to try differentthings out and settle for the best...

HTH.

Hi All,

1)What is the procedure to call an expect script from a shell script?

2)Is it possible to do the vice versa?

3)I have to form a string like "20061026-abc-recent" (i have done it with
the date command in shell script) and send it to the ftp get command.(the
ftp automation is in expect).

Pl advise.

Sivaraman,

	If you want to automate ftp then you can make do with netrc(5). I hav done it and works reasonably well.

	I have tried to use expect long ago and tried some basic things. Looks good to me but didn't go beyond.

	I am sure many LUGGies can help since expect is a very powerful scipting and test automation tool and many folks in India will be familiar with it.

	Which other nation in the whole world does more testing and software maintenance work than India? :-)

Man,
	I just recollected that there are 100s of ways in which to make ftp non interactive and so many different variants of ftp command line.

	The ftp in OpenBSD can talk http as well. :-) Well...

	And the ftp in NetBSD is the sexiest I have seen. It is so scriptable and non interactive that it is a treat to watch the pkgsrc in action as it uses ftp in the background.

	And of course you have ncftp which is the most user friendly console ftp client I have seen. I have heard of lftp, mirror and so on.

	All these are available on linux. If I am not much mistaken you use linux, right? :-)

	Though ftp is the oldest fossil and a broken protocol, support for it doesn't seem to be decreasing, only increasing.

	And sftp, scp's step sister doesn't seem to interest folks as much as scp.

Best,
Girish

Hi,

You can use autoexpect to create an expect script for you. Check whether 
this is what you want.

To use expect do this :
 >From pc A run the command

$ autoexpect -f abcd.exp

U get the shell prompt here.
Run a ftp,get the txt files from the other PC and close the ftp connection.

After this type exit to come back to shell.
The script abcd.exp will be an expect script,that u can modify a little and
use for automation.

To use the script use

$ expect abcd.exp

I Disagree on that. Installation in windows is a breeze, mainly because
most of the installation files are static builds. Whereas, in Linux,
there quite a lot of dependencies for every installation. This is indeed
a good feature resulting in re usability of code. However, Manually
resolving the dependencies is a short cut to hell :-)

IIRC IIS has a graphical configuration. Apache has cryptic text files
for configuration. I remember a thread on /. which ranted about apache's
cryptic configuration. Of course this is more of a head ache to the sys
admins. For my basic needs, apache works well out of the box.

It's not just apache, look up almost any software in the FOSS world
and you would find that the emphasis on features and/or performance is
much greater than user interfaces and ease of use. There are
exceptions of course, but the majority goes by this trend. Whether
this is a boon or a bane is dependent on the user base. I for one, and
I am sure many of the so-called geeks here would agree on this,
consider it a boon and would on any day go for more power and
flexibility rather than ease of use...

it moves on...

Of course not, geeks might choose power when it's an either-or choice.
 But that's just because the same geeks are not competent/interested
enough in building things that are both. :)

Before updating note this:
<quote>
Ubuntu 6.10 will be supported for 18 months on both desktops and
servers. Note that the previous stable release (6.06 LTS) is a
long-term support release, and so users requiring a longer support
lifetime may choose to continue using that version rather than upgrade
to or install 6.10.

I have decided to jump in and add to the confusion. :-)

Bear with me!

I shall try to explain what Kenneth meant using a simple C expression.

As usual C is known for its economy of expression and sometimes it takes close to half an hour to understand a single line of C code especially when there is bit manipulation or multiple assignment/comparison operators.

Anyway coming to the point,

There is such a thing as Console GUI. You have several colors available in the console itself provided it is not a vt100 or vt220 console. I guess around 7 colors and attributes like reverse video,bold, underline etc.

For those of you who have used vim with syntax highlighting and seen man pages in the console will get what I mean.

So gui != graphics

Now, the advantage of GUI over text/command line is obvious, so I don't have to talk about it.

The advantage of text/command line over GUI? Well let me explain.

Scriptability. First and foremost I think this is where command line wins hands down. For a non interactive command line app this is heaven.

Flexibility. Now, no GUI on earth can account for all the various command line options and cater to the full range of user tastes and preferences

Speed and agility

Ability to combine with piping to either redirect input/output or both

And so on and so forth.

Now, coming to the main topic of ease of use, I will talk about a related issue, of that of portability and "just works out of the box" concept.

Not many graphics cards are properly supported by UNIX and it is not always possible to run GUI under restricted environments. And you can't get that working easily remotely or thro' the serial console.

However console GUI/command line don't have this restriction.

Ease of use? Well, to quote my own experience, ddd is supposed to be a graphical interface to gdb, but gdb is so well written with tab completion and all that, I never use ddd.

And mail client. I don't think any mail client is more powerful and easy to use than mutt. This is console gui with colors, threaded view, highlighting everything.

It gives you a complete (more or less :-) graphical experience inside the console itself.

I know I don't sound convincing enough but I am sure I have touched certain portions of the topic.

Girish

One example to the contrary I can think of most definiely is ethereal.

It is so feature rich that I have never bothered to learn tcpdump properly.

And without a network sniffer no crypto/networking programmer of sys adm can survive.

So this is where a see a GUI being extremely user friendly and easy to use even for serious programmers.

I hardly think that I would have finished IPsec implementation on time withut the able assistance of ethereal.

Marvellous piece of software. And it works very well on Windoze too which I am sure all of you know...

Stepwise instructions - to view Unicode Tamil text

1. You need to have Unicode Tamil fonts installed on your computer and the
Operating System capable of rendering Tamil Scripts. Windows XP comes with a
Unicode Tamil Font (Latha) and you need not download/install a unicode font.
2. In the Control Panel, in Regional/Languages Options you will need to
ensure that Indic/Asian Language option is checked.
3. Use a browser that is capable of handling UTF-8 based pages (Netscape 6,
Internet Explorer 5) with the Unicode Tamil font chosen as the default font
for the UTF-8 char-set/encoding view. Unicode Tamil Fonts may be downloaded
from http://www.tamilnation.org/fonts/latha.ttf

True, but a clean GUI interface for configuring systems/applications
really scores over CLI.

Compare 'vi /etc/X11/xorg.conf' to system-config-display (FC's X
configuration script).

There is nothing innovative in the distro. They plan to go by RHEL and want
to be in compliance with it. The only advantage would be cost. When they
dont do innovation, and u just take another distro and replace the logos and
tags and give support, why cant they give it at a lower cost?

Umm, Oracle is pretty strong in linux kernel development. Ofcouse you
might not see something like Compiz from them but you surely expect
something like OCFS[1]. They do FOSS for business. :)

Also note.. If you need the CD for upgrading from dapper(6.06), you
would want to download the 'alternate install' CD image as only this
variant supports an automatic upgrade.

its not killing linux vendors. its oracle initiative to compete redhat
to give a better products and services to the businesses.

since redhat bought jboss some time back and broke the relationship
with oracle by directly competing with the oracle apps server. now
oracle is giving back (but once they are the great supporters of
redhat linux , now by them self :) )

The hypothetical scenario where a nimble copycat undercuts an innovators
open source offering which we discussed recently (and often) is being played
out for real!

There is an article at Groklaw on this:

What I am not comprehending is why isn't oracle offering to buyout
RedHat? That might be the most profitable merger, wouldn't it, atleast
in this scenario? Maybe RedHat is not selling yet!?

There was a comment in some site saying this will drive down the stock of
Red Hat and Oracle can pick it up dirt cheap later.

Anyway, I had this friend of mine who bought a new computer some time
back..He was a totally new computer user, kinda like a computerphobic
guy. I gave him the complete debian set and installed it for him. He
loved it, especially the clean gnome ui. He loved the idea that
synaptic is listing all the possible packages. What could be more
intuitive than synaptic or aptitude or kuroo displaying all the 15k+
packages grouped in different categories. Declaring Linux and *BSDs to
be too geeky just because we are lazy to type a 3 word command in a
terminal to install a software isnt fair. My only gripe is that Linux and *BSDs needs internet to rock, But once it gets it, it is blissful :)

Point taken.

But it took me close to two years to feel that I was the master of the computer rather than the computer being the master and I a slave...

It took much longer to feel good but at least I started feeling comfortable only with time.

It is the same thing with courting  a girl, learning swimming, cycling,learning car driving, flying a plane...

In what way is computer skills different?

I wonder

TTFN

Can you add more on that point ?,   If will be better for the Ubuntu
tamil team to improve, if you exactly say what drawbacks you found in
the above mentioned wiki.

Wouldnt it be cheaper than building your own force to maintain
packages in the event they go forked from that of RHELs?

My sense of the phrase "profitable merger" is not in the sense of the
merger itself, but on the time and effort saved by one such merger.

Quite likely. But I feel RedHat would try to do something to remain in
business, wouldn't it? Then there will be a fight down and you never
know who wins.

For a simple note, I still believe RHEL is as stable as debian stable.
If I am paying I have no reason to try another distro. Would it not
apply to most CTOs?

What tweaks?  For me it was almost all out of the box except that my
initrd for an old kernel got broken, had to boot in with a rescue cd and
install a regular kubuntu 2.6.17 kernel image deb.

Hello!

How do I send a TERM or KILL signal to a child process and all its
subsequent children?

Let me explain my situation. My Program (in python) uses the subprocess
module to start a new executable. Now because I pass 'shell=True', a new
shell is started and that shell spawns a the executable. Now I want to
kill all the spawned processes. If I try to send the TERM or KILL signal
to the pid which subprocess returns, only the shell is being killed, the
other process continues execution.

The situation is so. Py_Prog1 --> Shell --> Prog2. Now I want to kill
both Shell and Prog2. How do I do that?

Thanks,

Nice option.. but I dont want Py_Prog1 to die :-(. I could kill the
current process group if I wanted all the 3 to die.

Not sure but you could use setsid(1) on Shell1 or whatever session you want to eliminate.

But setsid also means that you lose control of the tty and all that.

I can think of other ways to achieve your goal but this may suit your purpose better.

Please do let me know if this does not work since something tells me I must be mistaken.

since you will have the shell's pid, you can kill the shell
and all it's child process using pkill like..

pkill -P  shellpid

You can try using killpg() system call or trying the kill() system call with 
the negated PID. 

Yet, there is no reliable/straight-forward mechanism on UNIX/Linux to
kill an entire process-tree. It is very likely that one of the child process
deep down the process hierarchy could detach from the current
 process-group/session by performing a setsid() system call and you 
will have no direct control over it.

Iterating/Recursing down the process tree (which is complicated) 
determining the process-id relating to their parent's process-id/hierarchy 
and killing one by one could be the only way out.

Good luck :-)

I *think* this should give you what you want. As already told this is not bullet proof or reliable but then I want you to be guinea pig for my program. :-)

Kubuntu edgy when boots, fsck has problem with my fat file systems &
stops booting. Even Ctr-c & Ctrl-D does not help. I had to edit from
mandriva2007 /etc/fstab of kubuntu &  change last digits to 0 0
instead of 0 1 so that fsck skips fat partitions.

Second is installing Ati Radeon X 200 driver,

Third there is no mplayer for kubuntu edgy in repository even after
enabling universe & mutiverse to play my tv. I had to compile after
downloading mplayer.hq although there several ubuntu forums how to
compile. Plf has stopped support for ubuntu. See plf.zarb.org

Mandriva 2007 did not require all these.

to James Gosling:

  He has also built a WYSIWYG text editor, a constraint-based drawing
editor and a text editor called "Emacs" for UNIX systems.

Was a shocking at first till I remembered that RMS had used code from
Gosling Emacs in the first versions of GNU Emacs.  Gosling was

Puts him up there with Guy Steele and RMS as really prolific coders. :)

True. But in any case, rms was the creator of Emacs (and the whole
concept of having a complete Lisp engine embedded in the editor). He
wrote Emacs in around 197x in a programming language called TECO for the
ITS Operating System which he co-wrote on a PDP-10 machine at the MIT AI
Labs. There were a lot of Emacs implementations in those days, I
remember Symbolics had one which they used to sell with their own Lisp
machine. Gosling's Emacs was called `Gosmacs' and it was the first one
for the UNIX (or UNIX like) Operating System (to be noted that rms had
never used UNIX or C at that time).
Later when rms started the GNU Project he re-wrote Emacs using a
portable programming language (C) for a portable Operating System (UNIX
or POSIX [a term coined by rms]).
It's fascinating if you realise that GNU Emacs is probably one of the
oldest surviving (and widely used) application in the world (30 years
old!). Must give credit to rms for his amazing foresight (think about
the GPL).

BG

My dear friend,

   What does "any info" mean?

   AFAIK ASUS motherboards have crappy BIOS but I could be mistaken. 

   When you spend money make doubly sure that you make proper use of it.

   Many people I see buy top of the line machines with no clue how to squeeze its resources.

   Understand that dual core 64 bit etc. don't always mean that they are better than lower end machines.

   The software may not take adv of it and in many cases also may be slower.

   That is all I can come up with. Your question was not specific and unfortuantely my knowledge is also quite limited.

   Best,
   Girish

Exactly.
I have a Asus A8N-E board and it has worked flawlessly for the past one
year.
And it is loaded with 2 SATA drives, a DVD drive and a 6800 GS card that
requires _two_ power slots.

And what is so crappy about the BIOS , anyway ?

Hmmm, google for "asus bios crappy" ...

(I have clearly expressed "I could be mistaken" as all this is hearsay)

I am told by my well trusted computer technicians.

I have also heard from other reliable sources though I can't recollect where from at the top of my head.

I understand that it is a very popular motherboard but if you ask the folks who deal with computer repair you will get a good picture.

You will get thousands of results for any query which is
"$manufacturerX bios crappy".
Btw, "asus bios crappy" (with doublequotes) gives ZERO results in Google.

If you are unsure/uncertain of sources about information refrain from
spreading FUD.

My grandma used to tell me lot's of scary stories when I was a kid,
none of which turned out true. If you are making a claim, at least
provide a link.

Subject: [Ilugc] Suggestions on Memory upgradation
Message-ID: <3c52da3c0610300348v4a44bd51o8fb9e7e464ee16bd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have an HP nx6110 laptop with 256 MB RAM  (PC2700 DDR SDRAM). I've
been considering upgradation by adding another 256 MB module.
Redington India (HP's chennai's service guys) seems to be charging a
little too much - 3.2K, and that too not for original HP product, they
(in fact, the ``service engineer'') claim that HP's costs around 6K.

Now I'm in a fix, after all HP's website claims 2.5K for a 256 module
for the nx6120! It does not give the price for the nx6110 modules.

I know this is not connected to Linux, but I'm hoping somebody would
give me some suggestions as to where I should go, and what I should
do.

Thanks a ton,

Ok Ok not spreading FUD.

Just ask any computer service person. 

I heard it from several sources...

Both local and international.

You should be open to taking multiple viewpoints.

Certainly not talking thro' the hat.

Mark hardware related posts as [OT] or [HW-OT]

I have observed this problem with big computer manufacturers.

Now that HP,Compaq and DEC are all one, I think my case should help.

I was asked to bring my Compaq Presario desktop to the service office in Chennai and I carried it there with much difficulty. I told them specifically what the problem was. (The problem was not easily reproducible)

I was asked to come and collect the machine after a couple of days saying that everything is fine and they did not charge anything.

Later it was only thro' "untrusted" unofficial service engineers that I got my problem solved.

I am not sure how this case relates to yours but 3.2k for 256 MB RAM definitely sounds fishy.

The lesson I learnt is that we should get a reliable and trustworthy service engineer instead of relying on these big companies.

I think they just don't care about you.

This is my experience alone. And  a viewpoint.

Others should have something different of course.

Girish

If we go by mailing list archives it could be 4th January 1998
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/1998-January/008372.html

Detailed minutes of prior ilugc meetings used to be at:
http://www.chennailug.org/meeting/minutes
but I don't find it there now.  That could give the correct date when
ilugc was born.

If it was sometime in 1997, then ilugc would be 10 years old next year.

This date may be incorrectly reported in pipermail archives if the
email cilent of sender attaches an incorrect date (possible due to
wrong time settings on the computer itself)

If you care to have Linux installed on it, do some home work and study
the chipset (via, nForce, SiS) etc and the individual controllers
(IDE, SATA, ethernet, ...)

I would buy a mother board without onboard graphics and will get
myself a nice graphics card.

You will be able to get the prices of qualified 3rd party RAM for such 
NB from Kingston, Transcend etc. Suggest you look up their websites. 
They are very good and I can vouch for them from past experience.

Hello,

I've installed Dapper Drake in one of the comps at my college lab. To use
the net, we need to use a HTTP proxy.
we're given an IP address (192.168.100.1) and a port number (3128). I've
configured Ubuntu with these proxy settings, also I've configured Firefox.
All connections to the net works (including updates, Automatix etc).

But if I give the same config for Gaim it gives the following error:

But if I give the same config for Gaim it gives the following error:

I've also given my IP address in the config.

However, if I ask Gaim to "use environmental settings" for proxy, and try to

Unable to connect.


Please help me.

MACHTYPE environment variable is not set in your
system.

  echo $MACHTYPE

In my Debian system, MACHTYPE is set to
"i386-pc-linux-gnu". 

You need to set and export MACHTYPE.

  export MACHTYPE="i686"

or add it in your ~/.bashrc.

Check your proxy configuration. You should allow CONNECT for 5050 in the
proxy.

   I'd modify this advice a little bit: If you get a mobo with onboard
graphics, make sure that:

1)  The mobo can also support an add-in PCIe or AGP graphics card.;

2) The graphics card uses a similar graphics core as the onboard
graphics, so that you can use a single driver for dual-display operation
if you want it later. Examples are ATI, NVidia, SiS, Trident, S3, etc.

-Siva

P.S. You can achieve this with an ATI RS48x S-939 board, and (say)
most ATI Radeon-based graphics cards.

Your proxy might also have blocked port 5050..in which case, you would need
to resort to a tunneling client like your-freedom..

Read find(1).

shell> find . -type f -size +10485760c -print

You can use -ls primary in find(1) to get ls -l like output.

shell> find . -type f -size +10485760c -ls -print

I am assuming MG is Megabyte ...

$ find . -size +10M -printf "%p (%a)\n"

That will do. You can replace the . (dot) after `find' with a path like
/usr or something. The . (dot) will search in the current directory only.

Hope that helps ...

Hi,

Interesting....

I have never tried zsh. Can you convert me? :-)

Just 5 things that only zsh can do.

I know that it is amazingly powerful.

Care to share your experiences?

Thanks.

Won't be too hard... ;)

More than 20...

http://zsh.sunsite.dk/FAQ/zshfaq01.html#l4

Fine.. My five anyway...

1. The most powerful, flexible and insanely (I mean it! It even has a
full changed configuration program `compinstall' for completions)
configurable completion system, amongst the shells I know. Right from
colored file completions to menu like selection with arrow keys to
descriptions for completions like options for programs). Maintains a
huge repository of completion functions which get autoloaded just in
time without hogging resources.

2. An excessively powerful (and cryptic.. some of their completion
scripts can be a good substitute for a scary movie :p) scripting
language. A person who knows zsh scripting well will usually parse
even hard outputs to filter the information needed in one
expression... this is one example ${} expression from the scripts
shipped in for completion :)

${(@)${(@)^${(@)${(@)${(@M)${(@ps:\n:j:\n:)${(@)${(@M)${(@f)$(_call_program
options ${~words[1]} --he

there are two long manpages zshexpn and zshparam dealing with the
syntax of the language.

3. Modular architecture. Autoloadable functions, and loadable modules.
Hence, light (For scripts, even the line editor is not loaded, and is
hence lighter than bash (dash can't be beaten though :) ) Not that you
need them, but there are modules loadable (around 30 shipped in) to
even create network connections and get an ftp client with your
shell.. Well, may be not a shell's job, but you get it as loadable
modules, so why complain!

4. Powerful, and configurable line editing facilities. Goes to the
extent of maintaining keymaps like an editor, and programmable. (I
don't know much about readline, so I won't make comparisons here)

5. Lots of small nice features like excellent redirection and history
support, a crazy globbing syntax (u saw an example above :) ), nice
prompt features, recursive editing (like emacs), using mime info to
launch viewers by just entering the file name, builtin timed
execution... can't recall more... I guess I use too many other
features without realizing that they are unique to zsh...

Give it a try.. You won't be disappointed... Has a huge amount of
documentation (some 16 man pages, also there as HTML)... Only drawback
is that you can get too config crazy... My current startup code is
over 600 lines of code, after removing some of the generic stuff which
I have sent upstream...

> I know that it is amazingly powerful.

understatement :)

it moves on...

Subject: [Ilugc] uncompressing a file
Message-ID: <20061101023357.91337.qmail@web54103.mail.yahoo.com>

hi all,

I have a file with extention tar.gz.

I tried to uncompress this file as tar -zxvf <file>.tar.gz.

I got an error as follows :-
tar: z: unknown option
tar: usage  tar [-]{txruc}[eONvVwAfblhm{op}][0-7[lmh]] [tapefile] [blocksize] [[-C directory] file] ...

because I am working in HP unix. but -z option is for linux.

how do I uncompress this file ?

anthony
