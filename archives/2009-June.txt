Hi,

Would request someone to clarify the meaning of delegation-only and
root-delegation-only options. I searched on the net on the isc, redhat etc
websites however could not understand the meaning of "undelegated response"
and therefore am not able to understand the meaning of the above two
options.

Ashish

There are a quite few. Most first person shooters like OpenArena and
Nexuiz does and so do Freeciv and other games.  Depending on what type
of games he wants to develop, there are few choices like SDL, OpenGL and
even Pygame

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] Safer domain search
Message-ID: <925234.77927.qm@web33101.mail.mud.yahoo.com>


Hi all,

I have been searching for a domain name for a new service we were planning to launch. I shortlisted a few good ones which were available and went back to register them the next week. To my surprise, I found them not available. These are not common names - they are very specific to a niche service and I doubted that somebody else would have thought the of same names at the exact same time.

On googling, I found that Network solutions and some other registrars do something called 'front-running' where they basically block all domain names that were searched for and force you to pay more.

There is a work around to this - Use
http://instantdomainsearch.com/
http://www.saferwhois.com/

Hope this helps somebody.

Thanks,
kc

After a couple of days, the domains typically become available
again.  icann.org permits some registrars to register a domain
for 2 days without making any payment.  And if payment is not
made, the registration expires.  This loop hole is exploited by
evil registrars.

I learnt this the hard way as well and was equally shocked.

Best way to check domain name availability is to query your
own dns server or look up the whois database.

Hello,

The following seems to be worth following up on.

 http://wave.google.com/

This is a combination of a protocol spec, a reference implementation
and an alpha stage client and server. (Apparently all FOSS).

I don't know too much at this point except that it integrates e-mail,
IRC/chat, collaborative editing (sobby), wikis and blogging. This
already covers a good deal of what I do!

I need to read (so much :-( ) more before saying anything else.

When I meant RPM is passe I was implying it from the fact tthat ubuntu has
eaten over the share of both fedora and opensuse(for a diff reason ) .
Fedora started it's spin projects and even started giving the project a new
look only after it realised the stiff competition from Ubuntu .

I dunno about others .. but as a small community maintainer . I knew how
easy it was to get distro cd's shipped from cannonical (shipit) in a
european country compared to a fedora ambassador locally .

No I don't have exact count of how many windows installations in netbooks

As far as I know almost all of them have  shifted for a ubuntu netbook

may differ in different areas.

making it instant is an answer to twitter . But unfortunately for google ,
It is entering the market a bit late . Maybe something from the API's may
make it a big hit .. which might be one reason they are releasing it on open
source license to attract the huge developer interest . I hope for google it
doesn't turn something half open half closed like android .

We regularly play Enemy Territory: Quake Wars in the offices ( only 
after  hours, and only as a network testing tool! ) - its a relatively 
modern FPS, and has fantastic team play!

One of my clients actually found that 2 hrs sessions of the games on 
Friday afternoons contributed to a better small-team integration and 
created a healthy competition spirit in the office amongst their teams!

btw, the original Enemy territory, is a free download ( but does seem 
very dated at the moment ) - you might want to look at the sorts of 
openarena instead of that.

I dont believe that at all, where did you get these stats from ? It just 
sounds like FUD that someone is pushing your way and people with 
blinkers on passing it on cause it makes them feel quite hip.

I am sure that the success of Ubuntu has motivated the Fedora
developers to change a few things --- why not!?

Conversely, one could argue that the success of Fedora's timely
release cycles (OK, this is perhaps a bad time to be saying that :-) ) is
probably what led to a few Debian developers and others to create
Ubuntu!

Deistributions can and do learn from each other all the time. At this
point in time, when the number of users is still growing, the
competition is generally a good thing for all distros --- no one is
really _losing_.

Regards,

Kapil.

Dear Luggies ,

     I have a problem in authentication and authorisation Problem in SVN

    I am using  fedora 9 as server with 1.4 svn version    and client as
ankhsvn 2.1 version  and tortoise svn

   the problem is  if i changed and add the new user for access the
repositary with authentication  no changes made

    it is common for all  ie anybody can  commit and any body can check
out

RPM is just a low level tool comparable to dpkg. Popularity often has
nothing to do with tools like this.The most popular operating system -
Windows doesn't even have a integrate package manager!

I would like to know your sources for estimating "market share". Fedora
has consistently grown every release

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Statistics

Even assuming that one distribution takes away "market share" of another
distribution, how does that help Linux on the whole? If a distribution
really wants to make a difference, it's goal cannot really be fighting
over the already minuscule share of users instead of concentrating on
the bigger pie.

> Fedora started it's spin projects and even started giving the project a new
> look only after it realised the stiff competition from Ubuntu .

Err, you obviously have your history wrong. Fedora spins evolved from
the merger of core and extras repository which has nothing to do with
any other distribution. You seem to think distributions are continuously
in competition while in reality, much of the software in a distribution
is from common upstream sources and Fedora is very active there

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Red_Hat_contributions

> No I don't have exact count of how many windows installations in netbooks
> are still running windows

The vendors and analysts have published such information. There is zero
dispute about this. Windows continues to remain the majority by far on
netbooks, laptops and desktops but hey if your analysis is just between
friends, then of course I can claim 100% Linux even.

and your local LUG should have Fedora 11 media after the release.

svnserve.conf has to do nothing with access over http://, it is for
svn:// access and svnserve daemon. So whatever you do inside conf
directory of a repository it wont have any effect for http:// access.
This is mentioned in those files clearly in the comments. Please read
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/, in order to understand the various
access methods of subversion which is clearly explained.

This may be due to many reasons. One such reason is, you don't have
the required authentication modules loaded in apache, like mod_auth,
mod_authz, mod_authz_svn, etc.

The following command will help you to identify this:

`sudo which httpd` -l

As per 1. your file is " /etc/svn-auth" but you have put
"/etc/svn-auth-file" in your apache configuration.

> ?? <LimitExcept GET PROPFIND OPTIONS REPORT>
> ????? Require valid-user
> ?? </LimitExcept>
> </Location>

Do not put "Require valid-user" inside <LimitExcept> section, just put
this after "AuthUserFile" directive.

Having said that, I would like you to go through
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ which has all the information regarding
subversion administration.

Thank You.

Dear Luggies

 Thanks senthil

But still not authentication is not accepted to newly added user,  it
accepts all the user who are try to commit the server  i want to avoid this
for common  and allow only authenticated people to commit the server( before
it works )

 I found there is no  mod_authz_svn   ( i try yum install mod_authz_svn
results no package available  iam using fedor 9  svn version is 1.4.6 )

commited pages are NOT directly loaded  in the spaces of   trunk and tags
and branches places instead it loads directly ie in before trunk  how to
avoid this / restricted this  ie commit is allow to under only certain
pages

I think  that book is not a too specific explanation about svn  i need more
info from real time handling people

  please share to fix this issue

some time i am feel very badly with linux in support  but i really like
linux love it

with regards,
Mettur Mohan

Even if you do use the installer, you will get Fedora 11 repositories
automatically enabled via a fedora-release package update. The blocker
bugs have already been fixed in the installer.

Unfortunately, these options are not offered by Dell in India.

On http://www.dell.co.in/ I could not find any option of choosing
Ubuntu pre-installed.

I tried out Moblin via a USB stick version on my Acer Aspire One.
It is really nice to use and has all the functions that one would
need for "Netbook as a Communications Device".

It is a bit unfortunate that it does not "install to a partition" so
installing it was not an option for me.[*]

When I next have some time I want to try out Android. Anyone tried
it on a netbook yet?

I think Dell recently announced the Dell Latitude 2100 netbook in
India which has the option of chosing Ubuntu as the pre-installed OS.

Hi,

Would request someone to clarify the below terms.

1. SCSI / IDE / SATA / Firewire / UHCI - Are these types of 1) cables, 2)
disks, 3) interface on the disk, 4) connectors on the mother board (like
PCI) or 5) standards / protocols (some say scsi is a set of commands)

2. Controller - is it something on a peripheral or on the motherboard.

Basically how do u classify a device under these terms.



Regards,
Ashish

Standards. But it is a combination of all the above (1-5)

I hope, you are referring SCSI Controller cards. Today in Low-end
mother boards, IDE and SATA controllers are in-built. In high-end
mother boards, SCSI may-be in-built. If it is not in-built in the 
MB, you use PCI controller card to interface with SCSI HDD.

There is a network of such 'evil' registrars who rotate the ownership of the
domain name so that it is always owned by one of them (for free ofcourse)
until you pay the ransom!

I always use Yahoo's domain name search service and they do not indulge in
such things.

Just try typing "linux" (without the quotes of course) into the search
box at Microsoft's new search engine www.bing.com

I just tried it and burst out laughing looking at the auto-suggestions
the search engine gave..

This i believe is the limit to which Microsoft can attack Linux
without actually attacking it.. =)

That's a bit too far from Chennai to be placing orders!

A local vendor who appears to be friendly to GNU/Linux is
zxyware --- www.zxyware.com. At least the web site runs drupal!

I also recall that they used to have the early HCL Edubuntu

Hello,

 "GNU/Linux on netbooks is dead. Long live GNU/Linux on netbooks!"

:)

Things are exciting in the world of O/S's which are geared towards
netbooks and other light handheld communications devices.

Two that I _have_ tried and both work very nicely with the Acer
Aspire One. (Of course, I continue to use Debian!)

1. www.moblin.org has a moblin v2 for test via a live USB boot or
qemu image.

 Its interface is based on the Sugar interface for the OLPC. Worth
 trying if only for the novelty. Perhaps it will change the way you
 think of the UI.

 You can also try it with qemu/kvm to expand your virtualisation
 horizons :-)

2. Ubuntu has Ubuntu Netbook Remix for Jaunty available as a live USB
boot image. wiki.ubuntu.com/UNR

 This also has an interesting interface based on dual vertical panels
 instead of the usual horizontal ones. It has maximus which can
 maximise screen space for specific applications.

Some that I have not tried:

1. Ubuntu has its UMPC version for Intrepid and Jaunty as a live USB
boot image. This is for low power machines with touchscreens.

2. Android from Google. This needs a download and compile for now. No
bootable image seems to be available.

Also of interest is Maemo.org which has the interface designed by
Nokia for its touchscreen phones.

Ubuntu also plans to release a remix based on the Moblin interface.

Regards,

Kapil.

A small correction. It is zyxware.

And yeah. I am settling for an Acer Laptop (Not a netbook. I could
do with a little more power :D ). This comes pre-installed with Linux
and is being sold by a friend of a friend's father. Will post the details
soon!

Are we doing Microsoft bashing here? I hate to poke my nose into

We are a linux users group not microsoft bashers club.

I agree. 

However, one way people assert their membership in a "club" is to
bash (club?) those who are not in it! :-)

My aim wasn't that. I know very well that bashing Microsoft will do no

I think there is some confusion about PDF presentation overlays.
These are usually implemented as duplicated pages with some
additional material.

If you view a PDF presentation in a viewer which just shows you
page-by-page you will see many pages duplicated.

On the other hand running in "presentation mode" in xpdf or evince
or impressive will show you the presentation as the author originally
intended.

Kapil.

They'll be _almost_ duplicated. It's Beamer's way of trying to produce
animation-type effects. eg. if you want 3 lines of text to appear one
after the other, beamer will create 3 slides where successive slides
have one more line. Viewing it in presentation mode, or simply making
sure that your viewer is set to "fit-page" zoom level should do it.

Why cant people be productive instead bashing and trying to find faults in
Microsoft ans vice versa. People inclined towards Microsoft criticize Linux
and people inclined towards Linux criticize Microsoft. Is this the way to
live in a civilized world. We should try to use pros of both to overcome the
cons of these.

My previous company had financial constrains when they though of having
internal mail server. They did not want to avoid MS Server 2003 for obvious
reasons like GPO, MS-SQL, on going Internal Development projects based on
Microsoft technologies, etc. They were looking for Single Sign-On Solutions
with low cost but effective Mailing Solution. As a Sr. System Admin, I
implemented Mail Server based on Postix, Dovecot, Squirell Mail, etc
integrated with Active Directory Services using Winbind. I also avoided
MessageLabs using SpamAssassin with MailScanner and CalmAV. This is a small
example which I believe most of us may be doing.... or something simialr in
day to day life..

I had written about this in the past. But I most certainly feel that
this search
offering my Microsoft is worth mailing about. Bhargav most certainly did not
bash Microsoft. It is like saying, do not ask the government sites to revamp
themselves to become friendly to non-IE browsers. It is essential for things
like this to be brought to light.

Well, this is similar to the story in the LFY last month. Good :D

I find this more worth fighting about than any of those religious wars.

Firstly, stream.h and fstream.h are not *standard c++ headers*, so they don't 
exist (afaik) in gnu c++ devel. environment. Please use iostream and fstream 
instead[1] ...

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

Secondly, you'll probably need the appropriate ubuntu packages corresponding to 
fedora's libstdc++ and libstdc++-devel. I'm sorry, i can't be sure what they are 
since i use fedora, however, they most likely have the same names.

Hi Karan,

I did google this and infact googled a lot. However, the more I googled,
more I got confused. There are some sites like webopedia that have listed a
single page with explanation of different technologies, that however did not
answer my queries. I was looking for some-one to explain in a simple easy
and straight forward manner.

Step 1. Create a customisation that you like on your own desktop (or
if you know how, then do it in a virtual machine). There are standard
configuration programs in the "Preferences" and "Administration"
menus to do this. Take detailed notes.

> I already read about UCK.

Step 2. Create a custom CD. You will need the detailed notes you made
above. This is for people who want to create a Custom Live CD _after_
they are already through with Step 1. The instructions are on the
Ubuntu wiki.

> But i want an easy to follow tutorial regarding all.I hope such one
> is there in the net.

Step 3. Be prepared to maintain your customised Ubuntu. There is no
point in creating a distribution without the support.

I would personally stop with Step 1 and leave 2 and 3 to others.

Kapil.

P. S. Step 0. Use your system for some work. This will give you some
idea about what customisations are needed for your work.

Tally is an accounts and inventory management software which is having many  
other features too.

1. do all basic accounting functions,
2. Manage your store and items,
3. do the job costing,
4. manage payroll,
5. get many mis reports which are useful for day today functions,
6. file your tax returns like prepare balance sheet, profit and loss  
statement, VAT forms, TDS, returns, Service tax returns, e-TDS filing,  
Excise forms, FBT reports and forms,
7. maintain budgets, scenarios,
8. calculate interest on pending amount
9. manage data over different locations and synchronize it and many more  
other features.

Is there a open source software available with respect to tally.

openerp (formerly known as tinyerp) has complete accounting and erp also. 
There are many people in India working on customising it for India and it is 
in use in many places in India. Gnukhata is a local initiative, but is not 
fully usable at present. AVSAP is purely financial accounting - does not have 
the complete features you want. If you want something ready to go, openerp is 
your best bet. You could also get some consultant to customise it for you - or 
you could do it your self.

Dear Kannan,

You can upgrade Ubuntu to the latest version either with the Alternate
Installation CD, the DVD or an online upgrade. You cannot upgrade to the
latest version using the Live CD sent by Canonical. Do a clean install with
the CD that you have recieved, or download and burn a copy of the Alternate
CD from the website.

I think you need to set proper 'CFLAGS' using 'pkg-config'. When I
searched for 'stream.h' it is inside 'directfb' directory.

$ find /usr -name 'stream.h'
/usr/include/directfb/direct/stream.h
$

Then I searched inside '.pc' files, These are the packages which
includes 'directfb' directory.

$ find /usr -name '*.pc' -exec grep -H 'Cflags:.*directfb' {} \;
/usr/lib/pkgconfig/direct.pc:Cflags: -D_REENTRANT
-I${prefix}/include/directfb

/usr/lib/pkgconfig/fusion.pc:Cflags: -I${prefix}/include/directfb

/usr/lib/pkgconfig/directfb.pc:Cflags: -D_REENTRANT
-I${prefix}/include/directfb

/usr/lib/pkgconfig/directfb-internal.pc:Cflags: -D_GNU_SOURCE
-I${prefix}/include/directfb-internal
$

I don't know what kind of programming you are doing, But you need to
include 'directfb' during compilation. Anyone of the below example will
include 'stream.h'

Eg:

$ g++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs 'direct'` -o output somefile.cpp
$ g++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs 'fusion'` -o output somefile.cpp
$ g++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs 'directfb'` -o output somefile.cpp
$ g++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs 'directfb-internal'` -o output
somefile.cpp

For fstream.h, I searched in my system, not able to find, The above
procedure will help you to get 'fstream.h' file's pkg-config.

Mohan R.

In the more modern C++ systems, you don't include fstream.h or
iostream.h; the correct form is:

#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

I think gcc and friends will yell at you if you don't follow this.

I am trying to build a regular expression that will find all strings
that do 
not start with '2009/'. Any clues?

Which language/script are you looking for, you can actually negate the
result like in perl it is '!~' also grep has a command line option to do
the same.

I am assuming you could use grep here, if not, please specify how you intend
to do the pattern matching.

grep has a option to invert match, here is a snip from manpage,
...

       -v, --invert-match
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.
(-v is specified by POSIX.)

so if its grep, you could use,  grep "^2009/"  <FILENAME>

e.g.

$ cat >> /tmp/t.txt
snfgd
fdnbfognbof errgirnbinr
kjfnfbjgnb 434fgv 54y 5obn
2009/ rgerigbir nr
vrgnbn
2009/ y fdgovrf23 3gp 4
bgfbog
232234
565
2009
regtrgm ^[[A^[[A
2009 enfvfrnv evirvir
vornbtr

$ grep "^2009/" /tmp/t.txt
2009/ rgerigbir nr
2009/ y fdgovrf23 3gp 4


$ grep -v "^2009/" /tmp/t.txt

That is odd, I am guessing they are trying to do some grouping.

If you look at the wordtracker or the google keywords tool, you'll 
notice that 'linux windows' is almost never a search item, so its not 
something that bing is bringing in based on 'historically what people 
searched for'.

sorry, should have been more specific. This is an apache rewrite rule. My site 
is 

http://example.com

I want all calls to this site to be rewritten as
http://example.com/2009/. For example:
http://example.com/home/ should become http://example.com/2009/home/. So here 
the logic is that is the url does not start with '2009/', that should be 
inserted, otherwise it should be left alone.

Tried ReWriteCond + ReWriteRule?

<havent tried>
RewriteCond $1 !^(2009)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /2009/$1

What does this mean? You want to boot into Windows only directly?

Boot your Windows XP CD-ROM, and when it says "Welcome to Setup", hit
the R key to access the recovery console. There is a full description of
the steps needed to do this here:
<http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307654>

At the recovery console, type the following:

	fixmbr

For a full description of the command, see:
<http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/bootcons_fixmbr.mspx?mfr=true> and for warnings on the use of the command and more helpful documentation, scroll down to the FIXMBR section on the following page: <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058>.

Hi Rajeshkumar,

Please use acl for this

Syntax:
In Acl listing:

acl block url_regex -i "/etc/squid/squid-block.acl"

In Http_access

http_access allow all
http_access deny block

make sure you have the entries in squid-block.acl file

reload squid and it must work

Regards

Yes it did get installed but sorry for the question it must be
configuring bugzilla as I could see where it has got downloaded. I
searched in all the places but could not find bugzilla's web
interface.

See http://www.hacksawlabs.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=55:install-bugzilla-on-ubuntu-810&catid=36:system-administration&Itemid=53
Also, you could check for help files in
/usr/share/doc/bugzilla-<version>, if it's there.

Bugzilla may be an overkill for many requirements.

Suggest mantisbt.org as a light weight replacement
for bugzilla.  Mantis is also fairly customizable and
can fit many a ticket/issue tracking roles.

Squid itself offers basic access control and content filtering.

But if you want advanced features (which you will no doubt require
in future), install squidguard.  It works a treat, and is pretty well
documented.

http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Subversion



Another good guide, that works through Trac and Svn, while it was done 
using C4, mostly still applies to C5. you can choose to only look at the 
svn part if you like. :  http://www.madboa.com/geek/trac-centos/

Hi!

Please do use Google to search for answers to questions like this
before posting to the list. Usually, you get nice tutorials, and if
you then run into problems or don't find enough information, you can
ask people here for further clarifications. For example, searching for
"subversion centos 5" led me to this:

Dear  All,

*Comet* (programming) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29>,
is reverse Ajax call,  we make a server to push an asynchronous response to
the client with an request, Most of the online streaming server work this
way, even sites like meebo.com, gtalk intergration with gmail are some of
the typical example of the server push technology(Comet). I am trying to
implement the same in on of the application but I got struck, If some of you
had already done this or something similar to this, please do share your
ideas
Some of my attempts

   1. I had tried couple of things with prototype and hidden iframe,
   2. comet  jquery
   3. comet  dojo

but I am not succeed with any of these attempts.

Can you try with XMPP over BOSH et al?
Also, one thing that you may want to explore is the Wave protocol[1] - it

Folks,

A tragic event today, following the (unrelated)
demise of Prof. Rajeev Motwani last week. A
successful Linux developer committed suicide in
Bangalore today - K.T.Ligesh, founder of LxLabs,
a Linux virtual server company apparently killed
himself after a security vulnerability was found in
his flagship app (the two events may be unrelated).
There were apparently no financial difficulties -
police say that his bank account had "crores".

The Lxlabs home page as well as the product lineup
look very impressive, even by international standards.

The hypervisor manager (?) that they offer looks very
polished, at least from the specs. Impressive work,
coming from a 32-year old. Tragic event, indeed -

Slashdot is carrying a story saying one hosting provider using their
software lost over 100K sites due to a hack in exploit; a result of
some bug. Still spooky but not as trivial as it sounded warlier.

author with authentication   via http in svn server   )

I am a person who firmly believes that suicide is not a solution. But
I also find a disturbing pattern in suicides.  It seems to be a family
thing (as in this case).

I also feel this is an example worth citing to some of our uber-cool
classmates who want to break into the best websites - just for the
heck of it. This is clearly a prank gone bad. I dont get any point in
deleting all files. Stealing some data could have had some value. But
not deleting them. I curse those who crack into sites.

I hope the cyber police get their hands on the criminals this time.

why are you doing this at the server end?? Do it in your working copy and then 
commit to the server. Never ever do anything directly on the server end apart 
from initial creation - unless it is some admin task.

and please do not address individual members in a mail to the group.

They encrypted all the data inside the webserver , probably the frustrated
cracker might have deleted it as he could not gather usefull information
after cracking in. It doesn't  seems to be a random attack, its a targeted
attack.

Message-ID: <224835.13760.qm@web7605.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hi Luggies,

I am facing some performance issues in squid .

i.e. I have Debian etch with squid,squidguard,shorewall.
Internet is? working in normal speed if clients are approx 50 .
If clients are approx 70 -100 it is getting very slow.

I googled for tuning and done the following things,
redirect_children 10
cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 1000 16 256
cache_mem 48 MB
pipeline_prefetch on
fqdncache_size 2048
maximum_object_size 8192 KB

Can you please suggest me how can i improve? much ?

FYI : We have Leased line .so we are getting constant bandwidth.
We are running the server in desktop HP Compaq with 4GB RAM, Core2Duo


Thanks & Regards

Redmine (http://www.redmine.org/) is a good alternative for trac.
Redmine comes with a major advantage that creating a project is so
simple and can be handled entirely over the web interface, unlike trac
in which you need to create new trac instance for each project. Also
if you are already using trac you can migrate all the components of
trac into a redmine site with ease. You can have a look at a working
redmine site here - http://dev.tce.edu/

This is really disturbing. The cracker should certainly be caught. I
believe too that the cracker might have deleted all of it as it was
encrypted (which made him angry as one of the fellow luggies have
pointed out).

> Stealing the data could have some value. But not deleting them.

In some cases, deleting all the data is better than it getting stolen.
Both mean a disaster though.

in which case I would higly recommend you dont waste your time with 
syslog-ng and go straight to rsyslog.

I am guessing you want to check the output from the modprobe ? you could 
just pipe it to logger and have that go through

if you dont mind installing and managing the whole ruby stack, yes its a 
bit nicer than trac. But comes without the large community around trac, 
or the plugins, or the features - and doesnt really address the same 
user-space as bugzilla :)

for anything serious or a large project with more than 100 people who 
need access, bugzilla is still the point. MantisBT comes in a second 
place, but only if you want to stick with the web and only if you dont 
need need as much tier control. Stuff like Trac/Redmine are a very very 
distant 3rd.

These are both good points, however, you need to keep in mind that he 
developers knew of these issues for a few weeks before the exploit was 
carried out and did nothing to fix it. The blame for the issue lies as 
much with the vendor as it does with anyone else.

Is that worth topping one's self over with ? almost certainly not.

Thanks Kenneth for your mail

ok  I do what you say forgive for this

Initially I dont have a *.svn* directory in the SVN repositary i created
Recently,
in server I am not able to create a  Trunk and tag and branches   please

Because of the last login user in svn repositary via http authentication (
in Linux Server ) still cache its user name and password  i try to create  a
trunk and branches and tag
 I have no idea of creating this via client working copy  i try to create a
trunk but its not stored in repositary

 Please share to clear that username and password in a cache

1. modprobe is used to load kernel module

2. If that kernel module, print(k) any message, klogd receives it 
   and send it to syslogd

3. The syslogd intern save it local file and pass it remote machine.

4. Suppose, if you want send the output message of modprobe command, 
   then, modprobe foo 2>&1 | logger

Bye :)

If i understand it right, you are trying to create a directory in the
repository without a working copy. You can create something like:
  svn mkdir http://hostname.com/svn/proj/trunk -m "create trunk directory"
  svn mkdir http://hostname.com/svn/proj/branches -m "create tags directory"
  svn mkdir http://hostname.com/svn/proj/tags -m "create tags directory"

> Because of the last login user in svn repositary via http authentication (

> trunk and branches and tag

You can pass --username option for any svn command to explicitly
specify a user to perform SVN operation. As per clearing or not using
cache, please take a look at --no-auth-cache option.

The good thing about Subversion, it is user friendly. You could have
got these queries clarified by simply viewing help for each sub
command. For instance,
  svn mkdir --help

would list all options you can pass with mkdir command. The 'svn help'
command would list all sub commands for Subversion. I know many others
have already pointed you to go through the manual. It does not look
like you did it so far. I request you to do it, believe it will
definitely save lot of your time.

Thank you.

Hello,

The web has a GUI interface and so does mail so that may not be the
point.

IMHO one difference is where the data is kept. With trac/redmine, the
discussion is on the web site. So if you want a local copy you need
to run something like wwwoffle and you need to subscribe to an RSS
feed to know when something has been commented on. Mail subscription
is sometimes possible but I am not sure how well these systems would
scale if 100's of people e-mail subscribed to various pages.

In the case of bugzilla, the discussion is archived centrally but
each subscriber gets a copy through mail _without_ additional
configuration. This copy can be kept for local reference by saving to
a folder.

In an increasingly networked world it is easy to forget where your
data actually is (and who controls it. ;-) ).

On the other hand creating discussion summaries over mail is really
much harder than doing it in a wiki like in trac. Reading through a
thread to figure out what the conclusion(s) was/were is terrible.

Kapil.

Subject: [Ilugc] NOT able to get the debug statements (printk) from SCSI
	modules
Message-ID: <F5BA82141F7AA94885B9643C77EEA5F21A3E61@mail.esntechnologies.co.in>

Dear All,

I have added some printk statements in scsi.c and hosts.c files to debug
USB Mass Storage Device. The SCSI module files exists in the following
directory.

/usr/src/kernels/linux-2.6.28/drivers/scsi

I am working in 2.6.28 version of the kernel in the CENTOS 5.2. I have
followed the following steps.

1)	#make menuconfig
	Enabled the SCSI Device Support as a module.
	Device Drivers --> SCSI Device Support --> SCSI Device Support

2)	Verified the CONFIG_SCSI is set to m or not in the .config file
	CONFIG_SCSI=m (in the .config file) set

3)	As I said above, added some printk statements in scsi.c and
hosts.c files (in almost all the functions)

4)	#make M=drivers/scsi
	I have executed the above command in
/usr/src/kernels/linux-2.6.28

5)	I have seen that the following modules build perfectly.
	scsi_mod.ko, sd_mod.ko and sr_mod.ko

6)	I have copied all the modules into the following path.
	/lib/modules/2.6.28/kernel/drivers/scsi

7)	Then reboot the system

8)	Then, I have inserted a thumb drive. Then I am NOT able to see
the debug statements that I added in the scsi.c and hosts.c files. 

Note: I have done almost the same procedure for the usb/storage drivers
and I was able to see the debug messages there.

Could any one please tell me where I have done mistakes?

I had also tried the same in Fedora 10 and kernel version is 2.6.28 only
and I was not able to load scsi_mod as a module. When I opened
menuconfig and checked for SCSI Device Support, I was not able to change
it to module. The sign was "-*-". What does this sign signify. Can't I
load scsi as module with this sign.

Thanks in advance.

Err! Why are you rebooting? The point of making them as modules is
that you can load (insmod or modprobe) or unload (rmmod) them at

Also remember that SCSI Primary Commands-2 (SPC-2) specification, and
SCSI Block Commands ? 2 (SBC-2) commands are used by USB, and Linux
USB subsystem follows *SCSI emulation* for communication with mass
storage devices.

Because usb_storage module is used:

You should have mentioned how you loaded the module, and what
output/error message you got. As mentioned earlier, check and post
lsmod output.

The module that it "depends" on hasn't been enabled (BLOCK) in the
configuration, perhaps?

Dear Kannan,

Thanks Kannan, for the information. However, please find the response to your questions below.

Yes. Generally, I use modprobe -r to unload the modules and modprobe -a to load the modules. However, in case of scsi_mod.ko module, they are lot of depend modules are available. I do not know, how to unload all the depended modules at one time. So, I have chosen to reboot the system. FYI, please find the lsmod output

To get the debug messages from storage drivers, I have enabled some of the options in the make memuconfig menu. 

I brief, my question is, how can I get the debug messages from SCSI files like hosts.c, scsi.c etc. These files are existing in the /usr/src/kernels/linux-2.6.28/drivers/scsi directory.

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

This is related to the Fedora Core 10 system where as all the above procedure is related to the CENTOS 5.2 system. However, my question here is (on Fedora Core 10), I am not able to set the scsi_mod as a MODULE in the make menuconfig. So, how can I set it as a MODULE?

Any ideas may be helpful to me.

You do _not_ complete a project and then ask for feedback. Sorry, that
is not the way FOSS works, IMO.

You open up the project, early, get feedback and continue to improve
on it. Commit early, and commit often.

Thats what i am asking Shakthi, i want the URL where open source projects
can be uploaded so that everyone can have access to it .

I have completed it. But as i said i want it to have more attractive
interface and want to make it more secure and effective so that a novice
user can also execute it.

git, like mercurial is a distributed version control system whereas subversion 
is a centralised one. As such, the former would seem more amenable to the 
bazaar style of development.

if you are using subversion, use google code. If mercurial use bitbucket and 
if git, use github. And if you do not know what the above are - please find out 
fast because without a VCS you cannot do FOSS programming

after that i will upload the project and will post the URL.

Yup, I checked it out an an Athlon-64/3200+ (2 GHz, single
core) with 1 GB dual-channel DDR 333 RAM and a 250 GB
SATA disk. Everything  was detected and  installed cleanly,
and with a few tricks I was able to get the boot times down
to 10-12 seconds to a text console.

1) Set runlevel to 3 in /etc/inittab
2) Turn off unnecessary services - YMMV, but for me
    that included Avahi, Bluetooth, rpc*, nfs*, and a few
    others. NetworkManager is another candidate.
3) Use a static IP instead of DHCP.
4) Disable  SELinux or set it to Permissive.

sub-5 second boots are within reach, but it may require a
dual- or quad-core box with the / partition mounted on a
striped (RAID 0) dual-SATA drive configuration, and /boot
on an SSD if possible.

I went through the definitions of mercurial and git and tried to understand
it but i am unable to identify my project whether it is a subversion or
mercurial or git. Please let me know how to categorize my project.

Hmm ... okay.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control

I'd recommend Mercurial, that's 'hg' ... use http://bitbucket.org or
http://freehg.org

And ask away if things aren't clear.

Your project will not magically manifest itself into using a vcs.
Choose one and use it for further changes you make on the software.

#01 Did you create a blogspot just for this post?

#02 "Using this Chained Selection program , we are developing a school
management application with following scenerio ."

If you want to do a full-fledged application, use Rails making it
web-based. If you use Rails, controller, view, and model will be
separated neatly, as opposed to your current code.

#03 What editor are you using? Please check your code indentation.

#04 " :username => "root",
         :password =>"password",

Never check-in code with login details. Use Capistrano [1] for
deployment and you can provide the details there.

#05 create database ? country? in your mysql by excuting this query
      ?mysql > create database country; ?

All this should be automated using rake tasks. Don't ask the
administrator or other developers to do these manually.

#06 Also inculcate the practice of writing Ruby test cases as you develop code.

KTorrent is now using port 6882". Even I tried killing it and

May be you could try more advanced torrent client like transmission
http://www.transmissionbt.com/ (tip you will have to compile it from source
as you are using fedora 7), and fedora 7 is EOLed (out dated and no longer
supported) you should consider updating to a latest release like fedora 10
or 11.

Did you use "netstat -ptn" to find the pid of the process that is
using this port?

Dear all, I am facing an issue in on my project, since i need some
suggestion from you,


I like to thank in advance, first let me explain you, about my issue what am
facing now.


I am Developing an wrapper for the  shopping cart. The user may use the
dealers site to get into my Shopping cart portal, Once the reached my
shopping cart it would be opened in the new browser window. Now the user buy
the things in the shopping cart and when he done with their activity in
shopping cart, We update the him with the confirmation message in the
Shopping cart the same message need to be updated in the dealer site which
is the first (parent) window.

Let me explain the same with an example. I am user who uses a local shopping
cart site to buy some items, when i click any one of the product, another
window opens with e-bay.com , so i browser through the product and buy what
ever i wanted, after completing the payment process, I get a confirmation
message regarding the my purchase in ebay.com site, now my let me come to my
problem statement,  is that we need to find a way to send this confirmation
message and some other details from the e-bay.com site to dealer site.

How come we could do this, they are two browsers with two different domains,
content of one the domain need to updated  on another browser. Could we use
comet for this ???

Message-ID: <b1ab11c60906112341h4f4ed298i8892dca3845f6a05@mail.gmail.com>

Hello List,

A harddisk on the laptop asked for fsck which was done.
The process took quiet some time and at the end of it, it linked all
the data to the lost+found directory and also the ext3 journal info of
the partition was changed by the FSCK process to ext2.
Now, all the folders and files are gone and they seem to be in the
lost+found directory and all the folders and files names have bene
changed to numerical.

the command tune2fs also did not help.

How to recover the folders and files from the lost+found directory ?

The help will be great for an NGO whose important data is in the disk.

thanks.

Thanks a lot Raman.
A manual, tough way, but the data is there, getting restored.
One of them is here with me guessing the file names (or giving a near
good name).
I wish there was an automated way of doing it.
Thanks a lot.

Prevention is better than cure.  Far better!

With so many online backup companies offering free/cheap
storage, there's really no reason not to backup your files remotely
and entirely avoid such peril.

To protect privacy, many backup systems can encrypt your data
even before it leaves your computer.

I use mozy on Windows and Areca (areca.sf.net) on linux. Mozy
gives me +2GB of free space, and my web hosting provider gives
me 50GB online space exclusively for off-site up data backup.

It seems as if the wrong fsck was run or the system was erroneously
configured.

These are _all_ the files which are recoverable but the process of
recovery will be painful because you need to identify each file.

Restore from your last good backup. (You did take a backup did you
not?)

Then look at each file in the lost+found directory to identify
those that are useful to you. Here are some tricks to speed up that
process:

 a. Ask your users to try to remember any important work that they
 did _after_ your last backup. This will allow you to narrow down the
 files you are looking for.

 b. Use the "file" command to figure out which files have which type.
 Then categoriese the files according to type.

 c. Use the "grep" command to search for particular strings in the
 document files which will help you categorise further.

 d. After that you will have no option but to actually view the files
 using a suitable viewer and see if that particular file is worth
 saving.

Regards,

Kapil.

P.S. Perhaps someone here knows how to use "beagle" or "xapian" to
simplify (b) and (c).

P.P.S. "The first time you lose data is usually the last time
that you forget to take a backup."

modprobe allows you to load and unload modules from the kernel. Some
basic googling told me that that it was a NIC card's driver.  I dont understand
the rest of it. I think what that message meant was modprobe 3c509 and check
the messages being generated. I don't completely understand the rest of the '

I am sorry that I made a big mess the other day. I know I was pathetic
when I was on the stage. I was expecting that I could switch
alternatively between the slideshow and emacs on the projector and
hence visually demonstrate org-mode. I was disoriented when I realized
that I had to alter my plan. I gues I did not scale up to the
occassion this time. I spent some time this morning and I added a
little more detail to the slide show.  I am once again sorry because I
would not be able to give a pdf. I dont find the export to pdf option
in kpresenter and it would take quite sometime to download openoffice.

For now, the link is
http://scriptdevil.byethost7.com/Documents/orgmode.odp

However I am getting the grip of beamer and latex now. So if I do
share some other documents with you all, I would ensure that they are
in a more portable format.

I once again apologize for the time that I may have wasted on the
stage the last time. I will ensure that I have an improved method for
presenting the speech the next time (If I do get a chance)

A LaTeX Beamer presentation in full-screen allows you to switch

That's alright, we understand, lets have this talk again.  Maybe other
org-mode users can pitch in with how they use OrgMode.  Plus if
everyone who comes there has already seen:
http://orgmode.org/GoogleTech.html  then we can have some common
ground to start from/stand on.

You need not be feel about your presentation, it was done well. May be next time onwards be prepared to take class even under a tree, though organiser may  promise all facility. These might help(apart from our laptop)

1.Have presentation in odp and pdf format.
2.Have them in pen drive
3.Have a live cd
4.Have a copy in email
5.Have hints written in a paper/printed out.

You do some/all above (may be some more) depending on the importance of the lecture. Any way (5) with some mental reharsal early takes us through most of the situations.

Will do all those the next time. :)

@Roshan: Sure. I think there are already 2 talks scheduled for next month's
LUG. One being the regular by Raman and the other being that Blackfin

make amends

@Shakthi Kannan: :D I was looking forward to your constructive

A RHCE is the base requirement for an RHCSS. So if you
are working towards an RHCSS, you must have done an RHCE
somewhere. Ask the same people.

Else, there is Amel Mathai from Redhat. AFAIK, he is an RHCSS
himself and he came to our college once. Contact him at

There are places like HCL giving good training. But will be expensive and
any how, success in RHCSS wholly lies with the hardwork you put in.

Pls. try the following...
*Read the comments in the main cofiguration files thoroughly - this will
give a fair idea on the extent of the features of the services.
*Try all the services in the spiral method( 1 - 8 and again 1-8...), in
three months you should be ready for RHCSS.

All the Best.

Hi,

Did you try unzip command?

$ unzip -l zipfile.zip

will show you the contents of the archive without extracting it.

$ unzip -l zipfile.zip | grep JPG

will show you all the JPG files inside that archive.

HTH.

Cheers!

Thanks for your reply,I did it for recursive grep based on your suggestion
as shown below,

for file in *.zip ;
do
    unzip -l $file | grep -ir  jpg
    if [ $? = 0 ]
     then
      echo $file
   fi
done

The installer storage layer was completely rewritten from scratch and it
appears we are having some issues with it.

Do you get a traceback? If so can you post it or file it in bugzilla?
One thing to try is to use the default partition layout or try booting
with "textinst" to get the text installer.

Try adding username (yourphone number) and password( may be your name) , try
running 'wvdialconf' is it detecting your modem? If wvdialconf command is
not detecting your modem, try changing the "baud" manually (tip if the
connection speed is 230kbps then change it to 203400) , i  got problem
connecting  bsnl wll phone internet , but changed the baud in
/etc/wvdial.conf manually  and  now  its working :)

Good luck.

It looks as if the connection was made. It is possible that your ppp
settings are off. You may need to configure a username/password and
the correct baud rate.

Message-ID: <69621d830906180913h6739d6a1j93a23522751fdf56@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, i am not sure if i should mail here about this networking issue here or
not. One of my server is running under Debian 5.0
It is Dspace instituitional respository server. Each and every
administrative jobs like data entries are being done over web browser. But,
the problem here is, when our office networking becomes too much busy, our
data entry operator cannot input data there in my dspace server, it becomes
really really slow to submit any documents there in that Dspace server.

Now, i need to bypass our proxy server in order to boost up this data entry
operation. How can i do that? I mean, how can i make my Dspace server enable
for "bypassing proxy server"?

client's computer by going to .....edit===> preferences ==>network setting
in web browser of ur client....

Aircel GPRS::

dnt have a complicated wvdial setting:

the dial no must be *99# and boud rate is 115200

the configuration shoull be

[Dialer Defaults]
Init1 = ATZ
Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
stupid mode = 1
Modem Type = Bluetooth Modem
Baud = 115200
New PPPD = yes
Modem = /dev/rfcomm0
ISDN = 0
Phone = *99#
Username = [Any No Or Text]
Password = [Any No Or Text]

save this configuration and restart your bluetooth!!
if still the problem persists then scan your phone for channel
details!! for more details read my blog

What help do you need in it's configuration? Basic configuration is
quite simple and straight forward. And their documentation is also
easy to understand. If you have a specific need then we can help out
with it.

Can you refine your query here?

Do you have dedicated Storage on your network? 

With NAS, Samba, NFS, FTP shares are created and shared over the
network.

If NAS is configured properly, Places ---> Network in any modern GNU/
Linux GNOME desktop should help in locating it.

With regard to SAN, for redhat derivative you need to install
iscsi-initiator-utils package, and need to discover the target using
iscsiadm command.

for debian derivates, its open-iscsi pacakge.

these links should help,

Message-ID: <7c956f0c0906200449s253b4341n501b1e4f59f5eaa3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I have been a Debian user since Debian Etch and have moved on to Lenny
with its release. There is an issue which I faced in a few computers
with screen resolution. The computers which were running with 1024x768
as the default maximum resolution supported a maximum resolution of
800x600 when upgraded to Lenny.

Normally to sort out issues with screen resolution, I use
'dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' wherein I will be able to configure
the screen resolution. But in lenny, there seems to be o provision to
do the same. How can get this job done without manually having to edit
the configuration files?

Thank you.

Regards,
Guruprasad.

You can also try 
  dpkg-reconfigure -plow xserver-xorg
This will allow to access to a few more configuration variables.

Note that more recent (squeeze?) xserver-xorg setups use _no_
configuration file by default (which is not without controversy as you
can imagine!). This is because the xserver queries the hardware and
sets up things automatically.

So if you have a specific configuration file that you like then you
should make a copy of it and use it. Note also that Debian generally
keeps a backup of your configuration files in
 /etc/X11/xorg.conf.<date>
If an older configuration file worked better for you then you can use
that. Of course, this only applies is you upgrade --- motto is
"upgrade, do re-install".

Regards,

Kapil.

Even with 'dpkg-reconfigure -plow xserver-xorg' there is no provision
to tweak the resolution configuration.

Try moving the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. Newer Xorg auto detects and
configures the required values. I am not sure what version of Xorg
does lenny have. I had this problem when I upgraded ubuntu 8.04 to
8.10. Removing the xorg.conf did the trick.

This didn't work for me. IIRC, the same 'dpkg-reconfigure
xserver-xorg' used to allow the screen resolution to be configured.
But it appears to be no longer the same on lenny. There seems to be
some to automagic configuration due to which screen resolution
configuration is not provided as an option. But the screen resolution
is automagically configured to a resolution lesser than the maximum
resolution supported. Are there any ways to overcome this?

Thanks in advance.

You are correct. The debconf templates do not have values for the
resolution.

> But the screen resolution is automagically configured to a

How do you know that a larger resolution is supported? Perhaps the
combination worked in the past but is unstable with the new xserver
and could crash and/or damage the equipment. :-|

> Are there any ways to overcome this?

Yes. Create your own /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and install it. All the
tweaking of the configuration that was possible in the past is still
possible. :-)

This file can be created in many ways. As mentioned earlier, there is
also a backup copy of this file when systems are upgraded.

Best of luck,

Kapil.

A resolution of 1024x768 was available on Debian Etch installation on
the same machine.
So I assumed the resolution to be supported. But in Lenny the maximum
available resolution on the same machine after the upgrade is 800x600
and I can't find a way to change it without directly editing the
configuration files.

Or maybe is this a change in xserver rather than in debconf?

The very purpose of this question is to avoid direct editing of the
configuration files. :-). Anyways, I will try it and get back with the
results. :-)

You _can_ create package that contains a number of different xorg
config files and installs the appropriate one as /etc/X11/xorg.conf
file. The package would be a local one for your network.

Hi,

I had the same problem. For now I've settled with using the GNOME Screen
Resolution applet in the System ? Preferences menu. Now it sets the
right resolution after login but the lower resolution is still used in
GDM.

For me the maximum resolution appearing in Gnome Screen Resolution
applet is still 800x600 whereas the maximum supported resolution was
1024x768 when I was using Etch.

Thank you.

Have a look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log you may get some hints as to why a
higher resolution is being rejected by the automatic process.

One reason that occasionally shows up is "shared memory" video cards.
For such a card, adjusting the available memory in BIOS can sometimes
do the trick.

Kapil.

I did came across such problem. I don't think anything other than
gnome way or editing xorg.conf works. You can try creating a new
xorg.conf using  Xorg -configure command. Test with this configuration 
file then copy it.

Google is not a search-all. (Neither is bing for that matter).

Here is how you would start answering such a question yourself:
 apt-cache search flash

This will, of course, show up a number of applications that are not
relevant (debtags is better). But by looking through the list you find
can truncate it to something like this:

 kipi-plugins, bleachbit, flasm, flvtool2, freej, haxe, libming-util,
 mtasc, ploticus, pyvnc2swf, salasaga, swfmill, swftools, yamdi, warsow

You can then run:
 apt-cache show {pkgname}
for each of these pkgname's and figure out that some useful ones are:

 kipi, flasm, flvtool2, haxe, libming-util, mtasc, ploticus,
 salasaga, swfmill, yamdi

You can further trim these based on your needs or decide that none of
these do what you want ( :-( ).

_Then_ you can post to the help lists like ilugc asking for more
information not neglecting to mention the results of your prior
research.

The above is meant as "constructive criticism" which you can follow
in future. :-)

Regards,

Kapil.

Pidgin uses the gnome proxy setting. Configure your proxy in your

Google is not a search-all. (Neither is bing for that matter).

Here is how you would start answering such a question yourself:
apt-cache search flash

This will, of course, show up a number of applications that are not
relevant (debtags is better). But by looking through the list you find
can truncate it to something like this:

kipi-plugins, bleachbit, flasm, flvtool2, freej, haxe, libming-util,
mtasc, ploticus, pyvnc2swf, salasaga, swfmill, swftools, yamdi, warsow

You can then run:
apt-cache show {pkgname}
for each of these pkgname's and figure out that some useful ones are:

kipi, flasm, flvtool2, haxe, libming-util, mtasc, ploticus,
salasaga, swfmill, yamdi

You can further trim these based on your needs or decide that none of
these do what you want ( :-( ).

_Then_ you can post to the help lists like ilugc asking for more
information not neglecting to mention the results of your prior
research.

The above is meant as "constructive criticism" which you can follow
in future. :-)

Regards,

Kapil.

Subject: [Ilugc] Request to Digest Mode Subscribers
Message-ID: <3232b7ed0906220848t474efd0bpf7ecf71dd73ca2e7@mail.gmail.com>

I am most certainly not the admin of this LUG, but I would like to
take interest in the welfare of this mailing list.

If you are ever planning to reply in the LUG, the digest mode is not
what you want. Asking questions is a different beast since you create
the new subject. I would suggest you do the following.

A) You want to be active on the LUG

i) Create a new email-id for the lug.  eg. If your name/nick of choice
is Foo Bar/FooBar, create a gmail id called FooBar.ilugc@gmail.com. (I
had a spare id that I created by mistake).

ii) Unsubscribe from the LUG mailing list for the old id
http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/mailman/listinfo/ilugc

iii) Resubscribe with the new id through the same page. ( You do not
lose any karma points for doing so :P ). This time, you know that you
have subscribed for only the LUG (and possibly a few other mailing
lists). So use the normal mode. Do not choose the digest mode

B) If you are passive on the mailing list or want to only ask
questions,
i) I would still recommend A
ii) Snip the unnecessary parts of the digest mail and retain only the
parts that you need
iii) *CHANGE THE SUBJECT* from Digest Volume XYZ to the real subject
of the conversation

I would still recommend that you subscriibe to the normal mode of the
mailing list. If you use gmail, you can put multiple inboxes to good
use for this. Create a filter for lug messages, add a label to it in
the actions option of the filter and use a separate inbox frame for
that filter alone.

By subscribing to the digest and changing the title, you are still
possibly ruining the coherency and the context of the message as
gmail(which most use) and most other email clients may not be able to
classify them as a part of the same thread. This ruins the flow of the
thread.
I find that you may be able to retain it in the same thread by keeping the
title as

Re: [ilugc] <Original Title in the thread>.
Do not prefix another Re: Use the initial thread posts's title

Any more tips are welcome.

I am curious as to why you suggest this.

Does gmail does not have a way to automatically classify incoming mail
into different mail folders? I recall something called "tags" which
seemed to be similar to mail folders.

The digest mode is for people who wish to see the messages only
once in a while _and_ use an antiquated mail program.

With most modern mail programs it is easy to classifying incoming mail
into folders so that one does not have to read a particular folder
until one wants to. You can even set up "auto-aging" so that messages
older than a certain date are automatically erased.

There are a number of reasons why one should try to use one (or a
small number of) e-mail id(s) for as long as possible. Primarily, in
the FOSS world it allows people to identify your interaction with the
community.

Regards,

Kapil.

thank you. i am the list admin (not admin of the lug) and i appreciate all 
such efforts.

well, there is a web front end through the news gateway at gmane. this can be 
used to reply to list postings (like i am doing right now). the gmane web 
front end is at

Gmail does have filters, and as an alternative to using a different
email address, you can modify the address you give out. For instance,
mail sent to ilovepigs+cows@gmail.com, ilovepigs@gmail.com, and
i.love.pigs@gmail.com will all reach the same person's inbox. If you so
wish, you can then filter the mail based on which address it was sent
to. Pretty cool, eh?

While this makes sense if this address appears in the "To" field, or
the like, how does it help for mailing lists like ILUGC, where the
address doesn't appear in the main headers? I've not been able to find
this out. Could you please clarify this?

Of course, I can easily filter out mails to ILUGC and the like using
ordinary GMail filters, so I guess it shouldn't matter. But I'd still
like to know.

Thanks.

please do it openly - hyderabad LUG has that feature - just announce user has

gmane also provides 'nntp' access, you can configure your mail
client(I'm using thunderbird) to read posts. Here is what I did.

1. Subscribed to ilugc,

2. loggedin to ilugc account page and disabled mail delivery option.

3. In thunderbird, I opened file->new->account->newgroup account wizard.

4. In subsequent clicks, it will ask for newgroup server, I filled
news.gmane.org and gave account name as 'Gmane'.

5. I got 'Gmane' in the left side panel. right clicked 'Gmane' and in
the context menu, I selected 'subscribe'

6. A little search for 'ilugc' and found the 'gmane' address of ilugc.
Also attached it to sidepanel.

7. Now I'm reading 'ilugc' post through thunderbird (using 'gmane'
servers). If we want to reply to a post, click reply and send the mail
to the 'gmane' address of ilugc. First time gmane will send an alert
mail saying that you must be subscribed to the original mailing list.
Reply yes to gmane. Your mail will appear within 3 to 5 min in the
mailing-list.

I think most of the modern mail clients have newsgroup reader. AFAIK,
'gmane.org' is the only site which is giving 'nntp' access to their
servers. I don't know much about 'nntp' but people used/using it to read
 usenet posts.

I'd also like to add a read-only mirror I created a while ago since 
searching through gmane for old discussions was quite painful. Also, if 
you want to follow the discussions through rss, this is a pretty good 
option:

FYI ,Forwarded message....

Dear All,

Many of us have been advocating for several years, the adoption of FOSS
applications and platforms in our country. FOSS related advocacy has
been gradually gathering energies, including the campaign against
software patents, including FOSS in the CBSE syllabi , suggesting a FOSS
manifesto for political parties in the recent elections etc.

However, we do have a long way to go before FOSS is taken as a default
software option. Towards this cause, a network or a coalition of
organizations working on FOSS adoption and promotion, would be able to
act more cohesively on issues and strengthen our individual efforts.
While such an initiative will be energy-intensive and time-consuming, it
would help orchestrate our advocacy for FOSS adoption. We are writing to
you to invite you to a meeting to discuss the building of such a
coalition comprising of members from academic institutions, NGOs and
CBOs, research and advocacy groups, professional associations, FOSS
enterprises, FOSS user groups, government officials, media professionals
etc and also its possible priorities.

The first meeting of this network was held in Bangalore in February 09,
when over 30 people met and discussed issues including working with
Universities in Karnataka through NRC-FOSS, to adopt FOSS, train
teachers on GNU/Linux (the Karnataka Computer learning program in
schools is on GNU/Linux), countering monopolistic and restrictive
practices in the IT sector, technical aspects such as developing local
language fonts that are Unicode compliant etc. A mailing list and a wiki
(http://fosscomm.in) have been since created.Please see the
wiki(http://fosscomm.in) for a more detailed update on that meeting and
activities post that meeting.

We now plan to continue building this coalition, with a meeting in
Delhi. We request you to join for a full-day meeting on the 4th of July
at the JNU, New Delhi (exact venue within JNU will be communicated shortly).

The proposed (draft) agenda for the meeting is as follows-
1. Reporting on the Bangalore FOSSCOMM 1st Meeting and follow up

2. ?Open Standards? Follow up on the Department of IT's draft policy on
open standards (http://www.mit.gov.in/download/Policyonopensandards.pdf)
3. FOSS in Education
What the FOSS community can do to promote the use of FOSS in School
Education and Higher Education

4. Software Patents and other legal issues
a) Take up pre and post grant opposition for selected cases
b) Take up the issue of Draft Manual which deviates from the Patent Act
c) Take up with the Competition Commission, practices which seem to be
restrictive or monopolistic.

5. Building political consensus around FOSS as an important factor for
India's development

If you require accommodation, please let us know, we will try and
arrange at JNU.
The travel costs as well as the cost of stay would have to be borne by
the participants.

For those requesting accommodation, please write to the following:
Prof. Andrew Lynn lynn.andrew@gmail.com <lynn.andrew%40gmail.com> and Rajesh
Kalithody -

BB requires the BIS service from Airtel for data connections.  Vanilla GPRS
is not sufficient.You need to specifically activate BB data on your Airtel SIM
card.

To: ilughyd@yahoogroups.com

CARE is an international voluntary organization working for the
socio-economic development of some of the most marginalized and
economically challenged communities in over 65 countries.

One of the strategies for alleviation of poverty is through promoting
accessible credit for small enterprise to the rural poor. For
efficient management, this requires a database application which can
track community members' savings and loans. We are looking for
developers who can provide a web-based solution towards this end.
Specifically, we are looking for expertise in the LAMP stack.
Experience in microfinance would be a definite advantage, although
domain expertise would be provided by CARE staff. The software will be
used by small, local NGOs whose staff may have only basic computer
operating skills and therefore, requires a certain simplicity in the
user interface. Those committed to using OSS to help fight poverty
would be welcome.

This is a good opportunity to be associated with an NGO and could be
your contribution to fighting poverty. Although we would like this
assignment to be taken up on a voluntary basis, CARE would certainly
reimburse expenses incurred in the course of this assignment and also
consider a compensation if you so insist..

This initiative will be coordinated by the CARE office in Chennai, but
could also be done through our Hyderabad office if the person cannot
travel to Chennai.

Please do throw some more light on this if possible...

My two cents:

BIS is for pushing mail and alike and GPRS is supposed to be independent
using their APN & goes through a proxy thus restricted to a particular port
mostly 80 and applications that use sockets wouldn't work thats when the
Data Plan comes to rescue which uses EDGE.

Pretty nifty these service providers who make the best out of it all.

BB explicitly requires BB data service to be enabled for your SIM card
by the service provider.  You cannot take the SIM card out of a Nokia
smart phone which has Airtel Mobile Office (GPRS) enabled, and use
it in a BB -- only voice calls will work, no data of any sort.

Nearly all telcos bundle BB data plan and BIS for their subscribers.


> Pretty nifty these service providers who make the best out of it all.

RIM has a hand in it too -- BB is not a regular GSM/CDMA phone, it
requires support from the service provider for many data/smart phone
functions.

Also, moving a BB which is SIM locked to one telco to another is very
difficult, or very expensive.

BB is a nice platform, but a very closed one.

With BSNL as a SP, using a BB one can connect to GPRS without BIS.
But given that BSNL's BB was launched recently, i guess they would 'plug'
this soon.

BB is a nice platform, but a very closed one.

You're right, the email address you sign up does seem rather irrelevant.
It didn't strike me at all when I was writing that last message.

I filter ilugc mail using the List-id headers in Evolution. Gmail can
probably also do this.

Subject: [Ilugc] tamil unicode with xelatex
Message-ID: <1245777358.3620.15.camel@debian>

Hello people,
I tried using xelatex with the tamil unicode contents but when the pdf
is generated the tamil text gets rendered incorrectly. Here is the latex
contents that I used.

%&program=xetex
%&encoding=UTF-8 Unicode
\documentclass[a4paper, draft]{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage{xunicode}
\usepackage{xltxtra}
\font\lang="Lohit Tamil"\lang

\begin{document}
\lang
??????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????????

\lang
\end{document}

Then I did

#xelatex ex2.tex

It produced ex2.pdf which had the incorrect rendering of tamil text and
here is the screenshot
http://www.flickr.com/photos/26427529@N05/3654635582/

Please let me know where I am wrong or is there any other alternative

Thanks in advance

The domain seems to have expired and would have to renewed.

If you are behind a router, you need to enable UPnP plugin in KTorrent.

Catalog Builder is desktop application that generates catalog for your

unwanted characters/words from the filename. Then it tries guess the
movie title from the filename and fetches the movie information from
imdb.org. Finally it generates the catalog from the collected
information.

Message-ID: <95c27c8c0906250219u32d27af9q4b8416aada871093@mail.gmail.com>

IndiMail is a enterprise class MailServer (http://www.indimail.org)
which can serve users in a virtual domain split across multiple
servers for horizontal scalability. IndiMail allows the same domain to
be located on geographical different locations without requiring a
distributed file system like NFS, etc.
IndiMail can be useful for SMEs who can use a robust mail server
without spending a single rupee on
unethical software licenses. IndiMail also can be used to tie a domain
across a heterogeneous set of mail servers (e.g. mix of exchange,
lotus notes, postfix, etc)

The architecture is highly scalable and one can keep on adding users
for a domain on different servers. The MTA is a highly modified
version of qmail. The mail queue on IndiMail is a collection of
multiple queues which gives IndiMail to handle massive amount of mail
traffic. A typical architecture
can be seen  here
https://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=230686

IndiMail provides proxy for SMTP/SMTPS, POP3/POP3S, IMAP/IMAPS. The
proxies allows anyone to seamlessly migrate from a proprietary
solutions like Lotus Notes or MS Exchange. The same proxy allows any
user to access/send mails from any location regardless of which server
the user's mailbox lies. IndiMail also provides everything in one
package that a typical mail server requires (virus scanner, antispam,
imap, pop3, etc).

IndiMail was first released at Midnight Aug 15, 2008 to provide
freedom from proprietary solutions and is currently on Release 1.5. It
has been tested to handle around 3 Million+ accounts and > 4 million
deliveries / day. In my organization, IndiMail has beaten postfix in
speed at much lower server loads. You all are welcome to try this out.
A single server like the HP DL 380 has been tested to serve 100,000
users.

The full feature list can be read here
http://groups.google.com/group/indimail/web/detailed-feature

IndiMail supports all standard mail protocols. It is one of the few
mailservers which is DKIM ready. IndiMail's DKIM also supports ADSP
(Author Domain Signing Practice).
See http://www.dkim.org/deploy/IndiMail.html

IndiMail currently works only on reliable OS like Linux, Mac OS X. Any
attempt to compile IndiMail on Windows will stubbornly fail and
shouldn't be attempted (even at your own risk).

IndiMail can be configured through a set of Environment variables or
control files.
There are around 200 parameters which can be used to set any feature
of IndiMail.

A powerful concept called envrules allows you to set Indimail
differently for different users.
The source can be downloaded at
http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=230686

IndiMail also has yum repositories for most of the Linux Distros at

http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/mbhangui/

You will also find the RPMs for both 32bit and 64bit OS on the above repository

ReadyMade binaries are available in RPM form for the following distros

* SUSE
          o openSUSE 11.1
          o openSUSE 11.0
          o SUSE Linux Enterprise 10
          o openSUSE Factory

    * Red Hat
          o Fedora 10
          o Fedora 9
          o Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
          o CentOS 5

    * Mandriva Linux
          o Mandriva 2009
          o Mandriva 2008

A installer for Mac OS X and a debian package for Ubuntu and Debian
are in the works. IndiMail requires volunteers for platforms apart
from those listed above. Everyone is welcome to contribute. Everyone
is welcome to rip apart the code and find bugs or give suggestions. I
will also welcome anyone who can provide me a free shell account on
Ubuntu/Debian so that I can build a debian package.

For me writing IndiMail has been a passion. IndiMail is not a
commercial project and never will be. However, I welcome anyone who
would want to provide commercial support for Installation,
configuration, setup and architecting.

There are four Mailing Lists for IndiMail

1. indimail-support - You can subscribe for Support at

I found the solution for it. Though I mention the font name to use I
have to explicitly mention the behaviour of the font using the script
tag. When the above line was changed to

\font\lang="Lohit Tamil:script=taml"

the fonts got rendered properly and here is the screenshot.

Message-ID: <e6b5008a0906250858x24ce96b7l4014760f2bc25d59@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using Fedora 11 GNOME x86_64 on my Zenith laptop.

I'm having an issue with my touchpad.
My touchpad works with a synaptics driver on Arch 32-bit (which is
also installed on my lappy)
When in Fedora, I can use the touchpad to move the pointer on the
screen. But I'm not able to use the touchpad to 'click'. That is, a
firm touch on the pad (not the buttons below it) is taken for a click.
In Fedora, this doesn't happen.

Please let me know how I can solve this. =)

Below, please find the output of /sbin/lspci in case you need it.

Please go to System/Preferences/mouse/ and go to touch pad tab

Start xev in a terminal window and see what output it returns for the click

Good job Bala. I second opinion of Shrini, mailing list should be given prominence. In my opinion following may be good.

1.Editing main pages should be done by few. The login prompt can be
  moved to bottom and little obscure. This prompt should be renamed
  admin login.

2.Separate wiki from main pages. This can have provision for people
  to register and get login to add/edit contents. Any problem in wiki 
  should not affect main pages

3.Show next scheduled even in a separate box. If possible this portion
  should be updated from email from coordinator to the list.

4.For me http://iugc.in doesn't work whereas www.ilugc.in works

The updated pidgin though fixed the issue.

I don't face any problem. But nowadays I am getting the following
warning when I login using Pidgin.

"Warning: This version of Messenger will expire on Agust 15,
2009. Please upgrade to the latest supported version. http://
messenger.yahoo.con/download."

I am having problem with login in one of my networked workstation, which is
running fedora core 10. There, sometimes, i can log in as root in gui, then
i cannot log in as other user. Last night, i tried to log in there through
secure shell...but.. couldnot.

The problem is, when i insert the password as root... it just halts!!! Same
goes for "adduser" & "deluser" commands ( when..sometimes... luckily... i
can log in as root... ). But, most of the time... when i enter password.. it
just hangs!!

Go to your yahoo account settings in Pidgin. You'll see two tabs at
the top. Go to the second tab. There you'll find, "scs.msg.yahoo.com"
and a few other web addresses.. Open a terminal, ping all the
addresses separately and replace the addresses with the numerical IP
address you see when you ping.
Restart Pidgin and try connecting again..

HTH.. =)

Yahoo! seem to have changed the chat server setting recently. Pidgin
2.5.7 has the fix for this. Upgrading the package fixes this problem
for me.

*Go to your yahoo account settings in Pidgin. You'll see two tabs at the

and a few other web addresses change it to *cn.scs.msg.yahoo.com*.

then, give system-config-authentication command and ensure you haven't

You can use the Fedora CD/DVD or any live CD/DVD as a rescue disk.

Why don't you ask the employee? Or don't you trust your employees?
:-)

By the way logging in as root via the GUI on a shared system is not
such a great idea _unless_ you trust your users.

A clever user can easily use various ruses to get your password.

For example, it is relatively easy to run qemu in fullscreen mode and
get a prompt *exactly* like the one running on the base system. Now if
this qemu is running with key-logging, your root password would get
recorded.

There are many other such tricks.

It is safer to login over the network using ssh from a machine to
which only you have access. One other option is to use the SAK key
(usually Alt+SysRq+K) after switching to a text-mode console. This
will ensure that you are actually running the system "getty".

Regards,

Kapil.

Yes, he has one password. Because, that person is "in charge" of that
section.

Why don't you set up that person with sudo access to only those commands 
s/he is authorized to do so instead of giving full root access?

IIRC, in the past you have run into such types of problems introduced by 
the 'other' root users of your systems.

Surely you must have given permission to the web site to access your 
address book e.g. the username/password to your email account! 

Otherwise, how did the "website" gain access to your address book?

Would you give me the password to your gmail account if I were to set up 
a site and ask for it in the registration process?

Please *think* of the consequences before giving out your 
username/password of one site to another 3rd party site.

This seems to becoming common practice now, I remember when Shelfari
did it long back it was quite shocking to people.  Nowadays I see lots
of places asking for your password and promising not to reveal it to
anyone.

What is the output of lsusb?

Are you sure the modem driver is getting loaded?

Some times wvdial may not be able to detect your modem , try entering
configuration manually in /etc/wvdial.conf .

Please describe the steps you're taking. And what is the result. What
do you do mean by unable to switch. It stays at the same user? Gives
any error?
Is it same as this bug https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=481699

Could you please not do that?  Amachu is posting messages in Tamil
without people yelling at him, so he's happy.  I'm filtering his
messages to Trash, so I'm happy.  Enter KG (who unfortunately posts
other messages I'm interested in) and suddenly I've got replies to
Tamil posters showing up in my mail folders.  I'm not so happy
anymore.  So pretty please, let sleeping dogs lie.

For me most of the applications like system monitor and NetworkManager
crashes after suspending and resuming my laptop(DELL inspiron 1525) in
gnome.

I tried KDE 4.2.4  ,key board , GUI stops working after connecting to
wireless networks with Network Manager (i have been experiencing this
problem for a long time from KDE 4.2.1), so stopped using KDE.

May be you could try updating Fedora (yum -y update)

If you _can_ resume, then the problem is to do with specific
hardware peripherals. 

In most cases, the problem is with video hardware, so if that is
working for you then you are almost done. If not, then be prepared to
spend a lot of time with problem --- start by suspending/resuming
with X.

Some wireless card drivers need to be unloaded before suspend and
re-loaded after resume. I don't know if network manager can handle
such a situation and may be crashing as a consequence.

This is one reason why getting a laptop which has a pre-installed
GNU/Linux with all features working is a good idea. It means that you
_know_ that it all "Just Works".

Doesn't Dell offer Ubuntu pre-installed on the Inspiron series?

Regards,

Kapil.

Some of us are happy that you are giving us a translation whenever
you find the time to do it. Thanks!

       True, just because one member doesn't like non-English posts,
please don't stop the translations. It really helps non-Tamil people
who are interested in those topics.
