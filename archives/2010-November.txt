I am trying to use your logic here, but It`s not working because of my
ignorance.

My script can find the file and what I need to do is:

rename my file; is there any command of "mv" which can rename my file which
starts with "bv_001.3gp"? Here, I just need to change the "number", but
every other words "bv" and ".3gp" will be same? Are there any "mv" command
to do so??

Does this help you?

$ touch bv_001.3gp

$ basename bv_001.3gp .3gp | cut -d "_" -f 2
001

$ FOO=`basename bv_001.3gp .3gp | cut -d "_" -f 2`

$ echo $FOO
001

$ echo `expr $FOO + 1`
2

I have used both Eclipse and Netbeans.
Eclipse might have an overall better score, but nothing to beat Netbeans's
GUI designer. It makes Java desktop application development as easy as VB.
Netbeans also seems more practical with things like automatic distribution
folder creation etc.

It is possible to script this in GIMP using Script-fu. [Lua scripting is
also possible using plugins.] Or you could simply use batch mode if your
requirements are simple.

See http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Basic_Batch/
and http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Basic_Scheme/

GIMP is the pinnacle of open source image processing tools, and I think it
is great in the hands of an interactive user. For the requirement of the OP,
writing a GIMP plugin or using the schema language (if he does not know
already) might be too steep to solve a one time problem. Of course, GIMP ban
be used in batch mode to get what he wants. But I feel GIMP was designed to
be interactive while Imagemagick was designed to be used from the command
line as an online/in-line/embedded image processor.

I have used both GIMP and Imagemagick in my work. GIMP for interactive use
and ImageMagick for embedded/in-line usage.

Why not use something like a docbook template, fill up the name and then

are you assuming "_" is static and not going to change? btw, why two

[ ... ]

Thanks a lot for the help. It gave me lot of thought.
Anyway, I have a little bit complex system here to apply these scripts. :)
Situation is:

1. I have a file named "11001_mtv_2200.3gp"
2. I need to rename this file as .... "bv_001.3gp" ... "bv_002.3gp" till
"bv_020.3gp"
3. And, also this renaming will be reverse from bv_020.3gp. When another
file after "bv_020.3gp" will come.... that new file will be named
"bv_001.3gp" ... "bv_002.3gp" and so on...

So, here I am facing jammed with:

1. How will I remove that big "1101_mtv_2200" ... and replace it with
"bv_xx.3gp"??

GIMP in batch mode is more first time user friendly than imagemagick IMO.

Thanks everyone. I used ImageMagick for py and got it done using a
script. I wasn't aware of the GIMP batch processing feature, will try
that too.

 Near Perundurai, Erode District
Message-ID: <AANLkTikZhWoydoYfuvCuMKv=hKY8Kpdh6fiOpScHwK0R@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Today, myself setup a 65 seat FOSS lab, including 1 for principal (as he
likes to experiment with / do his regular work using FOSS) for Nandha
College of Technology, Near Perundurai, Erode District (
http://www.nandhatech.org), for the department of CSE using Fedora-13.

Also gave an introduction on FOSS for the 3rd year students of CSE totalling
60+.

The HOD/CSE, dept. staffs, Sys. admin / lab technicians showed more interest
in learning GNU/Linux and Open Source Software tools.  After having a hour
long discussion with Dr. S.Arumugam, Principal, it was decided that all the
first year students and other departments like ECE, EEE also get started
doing their practicals on the GNU/Linux platform.

I found this FOSS lab, a better environment for conducting FOSS workshops /
Faculty Development Programmes.

For any feedback, pl. contact Dr. S. Arumugam / Principal regarding the FOSS
Lab implementation.

Contact Details:

Message-ID: <AANLkTik8N7iTyLu5A6=4ignbqGmbLPGmBQVLO=w+aL3-@mail.gmail.com>

Application: git

What it is:

Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.

Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
central server.

Features:

This package provides the git main components with minimal
dependencies. Additional functionality, e.g. a graphical user
interface and revision tree visualizer, tools for interoperating with
other VCS's, or a web interface, is provided as separate git*
packages.

To know more about:

http://git-scm.com/

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install git

Message-ID: <AANLkTikReenuPgF_BDnLqG9EYRH4GcM=umwr3FngoZR3@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I recently bought an arm based single board computer with Linux.
http://www.rhydolabz.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=99&products_id=419

The bundled version came with a Chinese language version Qtopia. I want to
completely replace the firmware with a new port. The kernel source is
available with other drivers too. I am currently too busy to take up this
project. If any student is interested to do this, please message me off
list. I am based in Chennai. The project will involve building the root file
system with some tool and compiling and installing a kernel. There is one
version of the kernel which does boot and show messages on the 3.5" display,
so it is not important that the kernel be recompiled form scratch.

Regards,
Arun

The default file permission and the ownership of /var/www/html file system
is 755 and root respectively.  The location /var/www/html is called as the
document root, *Its the location w*here we deploy the web files for Apache
Httpd  server.  When you login as a root, yes you would have the permission
to have the save the files in the document root. The others doesn't have a
write permission , you can fix this my assigning the 'rwx' 777 [1]
permission for every body. This could by the command [1] mentioned below.
Reference for the chmod available at [2] [3]

[1] chmod -R 777 /var/www/html

[2] man chmod

Festivel and Espeak are two Text To SSpeech System available in GNU/Linux .
I think Tamil Text to Speech Support is also there in Festivel .
These two text to speech systems can also be used with Python :-)

My example was only for the filename he had given. He can then further
apply it as per his needs.
echo steps were to show what is happening though I could have done it
in step 1 itself.

Hi Arun

Why not try out Buildroot (http://buildroot.uclibc.org/) for RFS and
kernel? Pretty neat stuff. You can use trimmed down uclibc instead of
Libc.

I am using BR on an AT91sam9263ek from Atmel.  Very much similar  to your Soc.

BTW, What did you mean by firmware?

I think, it is Mini2440 board. Many Linux and Android port is
available in the Internet for this board. It is a very good
opportunity for students to explore and learn about kernel, porting,
etc..

I am unable to get the ID from this mail. There are 19 Srini in our
list. 3 are having Rediff mail id. In that, one mail is exactly
matching Srini Vasan (tosrinivasan@rediffmail.com) and no mailing list
transaction from this id. So I am going to unsubscribe this id from
the list.

Bye :)

For effective learning and trouble shooting  I think you should
a.Take a simple beginner tutorial. First ensure that all prerequiste are met. Follow it step by step. 
b.When something is not working as stated double check all the previous steps mainly spelling errors.
c.Try to solve based on additional instruction given in the tutorial.
d.If still not possible try some search engine (preferably duckduckgo- kg's favourite.).
f.if still not possible seek guidance from mailing list with following details
  The tutorial that you are following
  The exact sequence of commands/operations you performed
  The error message
  A note about your system distribution, specifc software, method of installation etc.
  Posting in Plain English/Other languages avoiding sms language

In the present case you have simply stated 'object not found' we do not know what is that you are trying to access through your browser.

Though I don't know php, a cursory look tells me it should not be very difficult to learn, if done systematically.

link..
http://blogote.com/2010/ubuntu/how-to-install-apache-2-on-ubuntu-10-04-with-php5-and-mysql-support-guide.html
till the step that says localhost works  then I went on to install php
as mentioned in the doc. Now I am unable to find the directory
home/<user>/server/ in the system.. so where to find the php
installation ?

4. Use [OT] for off-topic, non-technical discussions.
But, don't misuse this to start flame wars or to troll
in the mailing list.

5. Do not top-post:

Because it messes up the order in which

7. Do not post HTML messages

10. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal
disclaimers. If your company uses disclaimers, don't
use your company ID for the mailing list.

please confirm that the ssl module exists in the path of error
statement. if exists please stop the httpd server and download from
source and recompile wit and place it in that path. Note: You need to
have apache-devel package installed to compile from source. Also you
would need apr which i think must be part of apache-devel.

   First login as root.
   $ su -

  Then create a file in /var/www like
   $ gedit /var/www/phpinfo.php

  Now save the file and run the php script.

The above means its not able to load libdistcache.so.1, can you check
if this lib is available in your box ?

If you can tell how you installed apache/httpd and the distribution you
are using, it would be of use to tell you how to debug further

Yeah, Buildroot is one of the best automated root file system building
utility. It makes life really simple. There are so many other things broken
in the software that comes with the board. I want to do a fresh start from
scratch.

The board came with WinCE preinstalled as default. There is also an Android
port for this board. Even got it show the Android UI, but it is unresponsive
from that point. It's a nice play ground! But I have no time now.

BTW, What did you mean by firmware?

I meant it in a very generic way - Just all the software which goes into the
flash rom of the board :)

Unfortunately this particular board is not from FriendlyARM. This one is
from Hiteg. The DVD which came along with this or the software from their
website - all seem broken (I might be wrong - it could be just very poor
documentation and the chinese language). I am sure that the FriendlyARM
software should work here like a charm except for the LCD. The two LCDs are
different and the kernel is not compatible.

Yes I thought it would be a good opportunity for some student to work hands
on an embedded platform.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinMhXvU=721-Ec1W6_LdNDTV0jp17qFhfpYivJ5@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Groff

What it is:

The groff (GNU troff) software is a typesetting package which reads
plain text mixed with formatting commands and produces formatted
output.

Features:

The core package, groff-base, contains the traditional tools like
troff, nroff, tbl, eqn, and pic. This package contains additional
devices and drivers for output to DVI, HTML (when the recommended
packages ghostscript, netpbm, and psutils are installed), HP LaserJet
printers, and Canon CAPSL LBP-4 and LBP-8 printers.

The X75, X75-12, X100, and X100-12 devices, which allow groff output
to be conveniently viewed on an X display using the standard X11
fonts, are now included here. They were previously in a separate
package, groff-x11.

Besides these, the groff package contains man pages describing the
language and its macro sets, info documentation, and a number of
supplementary programs:

 - gxditview, which is used to display the output of the X* devices,
and can also be used to view PostScript output from groff;
 - grn, a preprocessor for pictures in the 'gremlin' format;
 - tfmtodit, which creates font files for use with 'groff -Tdvi';
 - hpftodit, which creates font files for use with 'groff -Tlj4';
 - afmtodit, which creates font files for use with 'groff -Tps';
 - refer, which preprocesses bibliographic references for use with groff;
 - indxbib, which creates inverted indices for bibliographic databases
used by 'refer';
 - lkbib and lookbib, which search bibliographic databases;
 - addftinfo, which adds metric information to troff font files for
use with groff;
 - pfbtops, which translates a PostScript font in .pfb format to ASCII
for use with groff;
 - mmroff, a simple groff preprocessor which expands references in mm;
 - pic2graph, which converts PIC diagrams into cropped image files;
 - eqn2graph, which converts EQN equations into cropped image files.

All the standard macro packages are supported.

To know more about:

http://www.gnu.org/software/groff/

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install groff

Ideas?

I have no idea what you are talking.

How  can dynamic IP change affect your downloads?

If the MODEM reboots even in software then your IP will change.

That is impossible to happen without the link going down and then
backup.

In the process TCP may timeout.

So even if you get back the same IP it really does not matter.

So all I am saying is that your question makes no sense to me.

I had used BSNL's broadband while at hyderabad I was "CONNECTED " always
24/7 most of the time until of course the official /unofficial power
cuts came into force. Once logged the IP NEVER Changed. if the IP
changes it can be a problem with (1) your router (2) the last mile
connectivity, check with the provider tech team also in the meanwhile
that could be the answer on 70% of the cases for ip change. I foud this
even when I used the USB broadband of RCOM, the ip never changed until I
reconnected after a restart etc.

This is an indication that you might have connectivity issues. Your
internet connection seems to be dropping and reconnecting too often
which could have lead to a new IP address being assigned once
you get reconnected.

Check your cable setup (maybe loose connections, bad cabling, excessive
line noise). Try your luck with the BSNL engineers in fixing the
problem.

Chandrashekar.

The frequent connection-break-re-connection issue sometimes happens with
BSNL. Once the connection establishes, it will say intact for 2-3 mins and
recycle again. It happens for a few hours and then corrects itself!!

Incorrect, BSNL disconnects and reconnects after 24 hours just to give you a
different IP. Otherwise people will never buy static IPs

good show again, appreciated. Just a quick question, are you planning
to form some kind of network of these colleges (the ones who
established F/OSS labs setup) together for further interaction (may be
in the future)? I guess that would give more awareness among students
studying in other colleges (especially who are not living in cities
like chennai, coimbatore, madurai)

bit weird in the way you answered his question and suggest to read the
comments given by others for the same problem. He may not good as you
in explaining things at times but I guess what "dynamic IP change
affecting my downloads" in his context means, experiencing issues
occasionally while downloading. This has happened in my friend's case
and later this was resolved by ISP support (but I'm not sure how to
get BSNL support engineers).

I too faced the same issue. My modem re-established the PPPoE session,
due to frequent ADSL sync down.  With-out listening my comments about
ADSL noise issue, BSNL guys changed my modem 3 times. Then I escalated
to devi engineer level to get it resolved.

That depends on the situation. Sudo is used when you don't know root
password but you are nevertheless authorised by the 'root' to do all his
duties. This is helpful in some situations; for example say you left the
organisation, its enough to remove your account.  Root password need not be
changed!

But for su to work you need root password! It is used by superuser himself
to gain root privileges if and when required when he is logged in using his
normal account.

Meaning you are not authorised to perform administrative duties. This, of
course, looks silly in personal computers where you typically know root
password but created a new account and forgot to add that username to
sudoers file. [The user created during install is in sudoers file by
default]

Question is wrong.

The first form is correct.

su -c is switch user to someone.

Look at sections in man su.

  -c login-class
             Specify a login class.  You may only override the default class
             if you're already root.

EXAMPLES
     Run the command ``makewhatis'' as user ``bin''.  You will be asked for
     bin's password unless your real UID is 0.

           $ su bin -c makewhatis

     Same as above, but the target command consists of more than a single
     word:

           $ su bin -c 'makewhatis /usr/local/man'

     Same as above, but the target command is run with the resource limits of
     the login class ``staff''.  Note that the first -c option applies to su
     while the second is an argument to the shell.

           $ su -c staff bin -c 'makewhatis /usr/local/man'


Whereas in the case of sudo, the /etc/sudoers file determines which
commands normal users can run without being root
with root privileges.

This is to avoid using the very dangerous setuid bit in executables.

If you want to edit a running kernel OpenBSD can do it.

Look for the section called UKC

This invocation is wrong. Unless of course there is a username called _bin_
and you supply its password! Did you try this command before posting?

Only sudo takes login-class as argument for -c switch. In case of su the
argument accompanying -c will be the command that will be passed to shell
with -c switch. OP's question is not wrong. Read the man pages carefully.

I am using Fedora. So why I specified doubt regarding "yum"

When I issue the command " sudo yum search mysqldb " I am getting below
given message (in fedora 12)

]$ sudo yum search mysqldb
We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:
    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.

you have to set up a sudoer file - sudo is not enabled by default. But I
think you are old enough to use su to root and do the needful ;-)

sudo is meant for small children who might accidently do things they
should not do - once one is old enough to know what to do and what not
to do, sudo is no longer necessary.

I agree with above partly. It is not only for children but also for adults who do thing carelessly. That said comparing su and sudo are comparing apple and oranges.

su: shift user - i.e. you become another user and do some work. Essentially you become the other user for all purposes. 

sudo: Is a separate package to facilitate delegating some work like - adding user, mounting devices etc without taking avatar as root. This is useful in multiuser environment (by multiuser I really mean multiple human beings) where some people may be authorised to shutdown,take backup etc. As pointed out by Girish, this avoids necessity for setuid and setgid.

true - before I grew up I used to log in as root, startx as root browse
as root and su to my id for mail and things. And of course I got
rootkitted. I also did one or two rm -rfs in the wrong place.

yes - for multiuser environment where there is more than one admin, it
is necessary (but not for a laptop which the OP is using)

This is means your filesystem needs checking/repair. Normally this will be due to abnormal shutdown like power failure. But in the present case it looks like time issue. Please check your time setting in bios and set properly. After checking time restart fedora.

After giving password at # prompt run following command.

fsck /dev/hda5

Following the interactive instruction. If you have more linux partition repeat the command fsck with others like /dev/sda6 etc..

Once done restart using init 6 or ctrl+alt+del

Yes, we have been creating a network among all the engg. colleges in the
Coimbatore region (especially, colleges affiliated to Anna University,
Coimbatore) for further interaction between them.

In the month of November/December, about 4 Faculty Development programmes on
FOSS
has been planned (interested foss trainers may contact me offlist).

AFAIK, colleges in the coimbatore and surrounding regions are more aware
about FOSS than other regions like Chennai, Madurai etc.)

Oracle Linux is a clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Pretty much like CentOS 
with the only difference being in the support services being offered (and the 
pricing).

Dear Luggies,

I installed Ubuntu 10.10 in my Pentium-4 box with 512 mb ram and Intel 845

800x600. I tried

sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

It didn't help. The same is the case with KDE also. What can I do to get

Tata Indicom's photon would be a good bet.

It may necessitate download of firmware with hotplug but that should
be straight forward.

However I have no real life experience with it.

PS: I hope you know that there is no such thing as Wireless broadband.
It will always be slow.

I'm using Reliance Netconnect in Ubuntu and I am able to connect using
wvdial.
The coverage is very good, AFAIK. Even during my visit to hometown (a remote
village), I could get reasonable speed in 1x mode (Broadband+ network is
available only in major cities).

A friend of mine uses BSNL EVDO and connects to Internet in Ubuntu through
wvdial.
The cost is Rs.800/- with more than 512Kbps(1Mbps I guess! ) speed and he
is satisfied with  the quality.

+1 for Reliance Netconnect. Wanted to pick up a Tata Photon+, and 
realized that my hometown (AP) wasn't covered in the list. Reliance has 
a far bigger list of covered towns/villages, it keeps me connected 
(mostly around 250-300 kbps, I suspect) in my small-ish hometown and 
almost all through the journeys to and fro, which is good enough for me. 
I use it with my Ubuntu netbook, and you don't even have to use wvdial. 
You can just configure it from the network manager applet (which has 
settings in-built for both Reliance and Tata modems - just enter your 
assigned number as both username and password).

Vamsee.

I am happy with BSNL 3G - only problem is in some III tier cities where
3G is not available, I have not been able to configure the 2G option in
fedora - but I hear it works in some other distros.

2mbps). I have no idea how to measure the speed - if any one can tell me
what tests to use, I will carry them out and report. It cost me 2900 for
connection and modem and some prepaid balance. The local guys have no
idea about billing and how to pay, so I have no idea about the running
cost. I have been using it for 2 months now, and no one has asked me for
money yet! I often use both the broadband connection and the 3G at the
same time to get additional speed (and to overcome BSNL's habit of
suddenly turning their DNS off)

One of my friends uses BSNL 3G and I came to know that he is getting only
local IP (10.x.x.x) which prevents him from using some applications.
I'm not sure if this is the case with all BSNL 3G connections.

TATA proton HAS no LINUX  support  am stuck with  one when I  called
their help-desk and was told they have no linux support as of now
however some people have tried they said depends on the model one has. I
have a Hauwai usb which they said WILL NOT SUPPORT LINUX You can try
Reliance they mostly supply ZTE and ZTE has linux support.

Message-ID: <4CD82824.3060607@lawgonindia.com>

This is regarding the 4-city Seminar on 'Monetising IP' that IPDome 
<cid:part1.05040207.04050705@lawgonindia.com> is  organising in 
partnership with Achromic Point who are the event management partners.  
Please contact ipdome.news@gmail.com  to receive brochure for the event 
at Chennai.

   The events at Delhi held on 10th Sept. at Hotel Eros 
Intercontinental,  at  Mumbai held on 24th Sept. at Hotel 
Intercontinental the Lalit and at Bangalore on 29th Oct. at Hotel Royal 
Orchid evoked wide interest and participation; the participants included 
Vice President of Mahindra & Mahindra (Ms.Usha Amonkar ), CFO of 
Religare Technologies (Mr.Manish Sharma), Manager, IP of Teva Pharma and 
Vice President of Bry Air Asia (Ms.Sonali Dutta), IP Manager of USV 
Pharma,  delegates from ITC, Philips Innovation Centre, 3i Infotech, 
Bally Technologies, Dynamaitcs and representatives from IT & ITES 
Companies and assorted IP heads and senior Managers.

     The Seminar goes beyond the conventional defensive deployment of IP 
and promotes a strategic perspective of IP that transforms it from a 
cost-centre to a profit-centre.  The Seminar has an experiential and 
hands-on approach to Intellectual Property targeting Value-enhancement, 
not just Value-protection and addressing R&D and Marketing Managerial 
personnel along with lawyers.   The methodology includes a Strategy Game 
in which two corporations and two consulting firms deal with live IP 
infringement and licensing issues that enables a higher quality of 
learning on a wider canvas, that has the potential to transform the IP 
Strategy in their organisations.

     The feedback we received was positive; many participants said that 
they gained a strategic perspective of IP and their learnings in the 
Seminar would enhance their capability to deal with IP issues in their 
respective organisations. We request you to send delegates for the 
Seminar from your company who could benefit from it.

"Monetising IP" - means -> How to get money from intellectual property? I am
sorry to say this, to me it sounds much like " A seminar on how to become a
patent troll?"

In Free software and GNU/Linux there is no room from Intellectual property.
I am sorry, you have posted it to a **wrong**  list :-)

Every member in this list is an intellect. But members wanted to deliver 
their intellects to the society without any consideration. In order to 
protect your intellect[other than software], I am inclined to reply as 
follows.
> The post is not intended only for Software. It is an information for all streams. Infact in my office Majority of the computer is running on Ubuntu for the past one year. I have been promoting Opensource software among my professional community. This is an information to pass it on to others who are likely ot be benefitted. If you feel this information is leading to patent troll. I am sorry you are misconcieved this information.  Intellectual Property rights includes Patents, Trademark, Copyright, Design, Geographical Indications and Integrated Circuits layout protection. Even your blog is copyrighted,*Copyright ? 2007-2010 Arun's blog. Sorry to mention personally. Our Patent Act is not granting patents to software perse. So Source codes are protected under Copyright. Even when you want to promote your opensource software, you need a trademark[brand name]. You have to keep that brand name proctected in order to promote your software. Members in the list will also develop integrated circuits which can be protected. Designs which you are creating using opensource software is protected under copyright and if it is a industrial design it can be protected under Designs Act.Intellectual property is not only Patents. Please look at the world with broad perspective. I have seen many  people nowadays using open source software for their business/profession. That doesn't mean that they are not entitled to protect their products/designs/logo.*
>    
     If you feel I have hurt you, it is not intentional but it is only 
clarification to be given to the members in the list.  Don't take it 
personally. Thanks for giving an oppurtunity to me to explain about 
Intellectual Property in this list.

Now, I don't know whether to laugh or be afraid !!

Why the eff would this kind of thing be promoted here ? I call this spam.

BTW, speaking of IP, is the domain name of the OP's email ^monetizing^ in some 
manner the well know identity of list member of (dis)repute :)

In that paragraph above I see 7 mentions of the word 'protect' or variations 
thereof. I don't see anything about "Value-enhancement, not just 
Value-protection" ...so please do clarify how do you propose on using all the 
kinds of IP protection you listed above to go "... beyond the conventional 
defensive deployment of IP ..." and to "... transforms it from a cost-centre to 
a profit-centre." ?

In case you missed the point, let me spell it out for you -- We in the 
opensource community are *not* against things like copyright -- In fact, we are 
very vocal about the who does or does not have the right-to-copy. What we find 
disgusting though is treating software as 'property' and using ^Intellectual 
Property^ as means to profit from.

People in the software business /ideally/ ought to monetize on software and 
services around it instead of monetizing IP.

 So this workshop/seminar is not about software patents? Will you be
discussing about various Free software licenses ? By the way the as you have
mentioned "intellectual property" is a broad term, please refrain from using
it. Request you read the following article on "Intellectual property" by
stallman http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html .The term "IP" made me
to think about your firm is actually lobbying for "Software patents". Thank
you.

Thanks for pointing that out. I've just been too lazy to update the footer since 
I hardly think there is anything worth copying there, but I've updated it. Feel 
free to 'monetize' on my IP (under the terms of the cc-by-sa copyright license, 
of course !).

Yes ! The most successful and profitable open source company, Red Hat, also does 
that.

Copyright and trademarks are tools to protect the identity of artifacts (I 
*hate* the term Intellectual /Property/). They are employed so that one does not 
confuse the source of the artifact.

Copyrights and trademarks are tools for *identification* _not_ monetization.

Unfortunately, years of greed and subsequent brain-washing has led to the belief 
that ideas are 'property' that have 'owners' who can assert their claim over the 
idea.

I have used Tata Photon and Reliance and both at the same point of
time so I can compare. Both worked reasonably well. But the Tata
device consistently gave better speed and robust connection. Reliance
dropped fairly often; while the Tata almost never.

I used it on a Mac and on a Linux Machine (Ubuntu, wvdial)

<CAVEAT> This is based on my usage in Chennai only. </CAVEAT>

But in one respect Reliance is in my blacklist. Their service at the
service centers is abyssmal.
I needed copies of old bills and they simply said "We cannot give
you". (This is not the only one reason).

Finally I surrendered my Reliance data card in mid-Sep. That required
a bit of song and dance finally I
did it. For one week after that I was called up by higher and higher
(in their own words) level folks
from Reliance asking why. I had to repeatedly tell them to refer to my
detailed letter.

After that stopped, the calls for over-due bills -- for October
started--I am routinely called two-three times a week
and everyone is so unsurprised at the fact I have surrendered the card
and still getting bugged and billed.

I am hoping to fix it when I visit Chennai, but based on past meetings
at the Besant Nagar Reliance Center it wont be
easy. <SIGH>

I did and I feel that you're trolling, not due to lack of knowledge,
but just to defend your stand. Let me explain:

> in my office Majority of the computer is running on Ubuntu for the past one year. I

*Using* Ubuntu has nothing to do with IP protection. You're using it
because it works for you. You're using this reference just to
disillusion readers.

>From the above, only Patents, Trademarks and Copyright are categories
that constitute IP. Others (Design, Geographical Indications, IC
layout) are specific examples of IP. You again combined the two to
make it seem as if IP is a very broad term and there are so many
things included in it.

Unnecessary.

This still does not justify you posting about this topic on this list.
Your email did not have any reference on the significance of IP
protection in the FOSS sense, so you cannot even claim this.

> Members in the list will also develop integrated circuits which can be protected.

Members in this list will get married, have babies, go on vacations,
get indigestion, etc. Do we start discussing those topics on this list
too?

See above. Your email had nothing to do with the core interest of the
list. If anything, it was offensive to a number of members of this
list due to the nature of its content and the implied meaning of IP.
If you intend to write such emails to this list, it would be a good
idea to add an [OT] tag. Despite that tag, it would be a marginal call
IMO. The list admins might want to clarify on that.

First of all, i welcome this initiative of setting up exclusive foss lab.  I
have few thoughts to share here..

   - Setting up a foss lab should NOT be an end in itself.  Is there any
   result oriented projects planned?
   - FOSS should NOT be confined within a lab.  Rather, we should explore
   how we can use foss applications for day to day use of the college life.
   eg:  intranet mail servers, intranet wiki, intranet forums, intranet blogs,
   a knowledge repository,,   Please excuse me, if these are already done in
   your college.  (In my observation most colleges dont even have an intranet
   mail server).
   - There should institutional mechanism, where the department consistently
   works on a FOSS project, irrespective of students studying.  ie, students
   should learn and contribute for the project, and when before he gets passed
   out, he has to train the incoming students..  by this way, we can generate
   continous pool of resources to work on any FOSS related projects.
   - There are many issues where Linux based machines could not be
   integrated to a windows network. (this is one of the reason why windows
   servers are preferred over linux)..  Colleges can work on these issues with
   colloboration from corporates.

These are just my thoughts..  although there are so much awareness created
in indian colleges, there is no visible FOSS product coming out, bcoz, we
lack product development skills.  Knowing a technology is different from
developing a product.   Unless we aspire to develop products (either for
research purpose, or for requirements of our society), we could not have the
required leap in FOSS movement in india.

Senthil

Message-ID: <4CD8F74C.70709@gmail.com>

There is a requirement to develop a portal using FOSS tools.

www.precisionit.co.in is a IT services company and
the largest sales / support partner for HP / IBM products.

The company has supplied and currently maintaining over 60,000 various 
IT equipments
like laptops,desktops, servers, printers, UPS etc for their customers 
spread across India.

The company is  panning to build a portal to log breakdowns, monitor the 
service progress,
plan spare part movements, plan man power requirements etc.

Was given to believe that there are  FOSS tools already in place which 
can meet most of the requirements
in compliance with ITIL processes.

If any of the member/s of this group is interested in evaluating the 
various available tools,
suggest the best one to deploy, carryout customization requirements etc 
by taking this
as a project / freelance/ consulting, please let me know.

With warm regards

What is the "device" that is associated with the network stack on your
mobile modem?  Most likely it is some kind of a PPP connection.

About Python
============

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, open source,
extensible programming language. It combines clarity and readability,
making it an extremely powerful language that can be used for various
applications and problems.

Python is simple and easy to learn and apply. It offers an interactive
environment in which to explore procedural, functional and object
oriented approaches to problem solving. Its high level data
structures, extensive documentation and clear syntax make it an ideal
first language, while the large number of existing libraries make it
suitable to tackle almost any programming tasks. Its simplicity makes
it easy to adapt to multiple educational domains.

Python has several libraries that enable numeric and symbolic
computing. It also interfaces well with native codes in C,C++ and
FORTRAN and has excellent libraries for plotting/visualization. Python
also provides libraries for general purpose computing including
generating user interfaces and web development. These, coupled with
it's interactive interpreter, make Python an excellent language for
Scientific Computing.

All these features when combined with their wide-ranging applications
make Python a perfect fit for use in Education, Industry and
Scientific Computing.

Registration Fees
===============

Registration, accommodation and food are offered at highly subsidized
rates for teachers and students, while registration and food will be
offered to all conference participants at subsidized rates. Details

Subject: [Ilugc] Apache tips
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=5P1NAtVAvfATtW2rd22gXubqgi=Vy5cMvtuNg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear buds,

I thought I would give you some info on my recent activities.

Though I have a good mind to make an open source project ( a virtual
machine ) out of my
 secure file upload/download creation I would share the key aspects
with you here.

I am not sure when I will get time to create a project for this on sourceforge.

Basically to add UNIX user authentication to Apache pages is simple in
OpenBSD if you use the
 mod_auth_bsd package.

Just have these directives in /var/www/conf/httpd.conf


AuthBSDGroup auth
<Directory "/var/www/htdocs">
    SSLRequireSSL
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Please authenticate"
    AuthBSD On
    Require valid-user
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    #AllowOverride None
    #Order allow,deny
    #Allow from all
</Directory>


Now since /var/www/htdocs is the DocumentRoot to access any web page
you can login with the UNIX username and password.

Really nice.

This enforces that the connection be SSL.

How to create certificates?

Simple.

 Generating a DSA certificate involves several steps.  First, you generate
     a DSA parameter set with a command like the following:

           # openssl dsaparam 1024 -out dsa1024.pem

     Would generate DSA parameters for 1024 bit DSA keys, and save them to the
     file dsa1024.pem.

     Once you have the DSA parameters generated, you can generate a
     certificate and unencrypted private key using the command:

           # openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey dsa:dsa1024.pem \
             -out /etc/ssl/dsacert.pem -keyout /etc/ssl/private/dsakey.pem

Taken from man ssl on OpenBSD.

Now start your web server with httpd -u -DSSL.

Of course all this will only work on OpenBSD.

However if you wish to use what I did on Linux it is trivial to use it
as a VM with either qemu full mode(bridge mode) networking in Linux or
Windows.

Or you could use VirtualBox.

I never touch commercial software.

hi,
I also got same problem when using ubuntu in my pIII after long term
search i found solution, do the following it will surely help you. the
steps are somewhat lengthy but in the interest of getting higher
resolution you will do all the steps(as i did:-) ). write all the
steps in a paper or take printout because in the mid you will get out
of GUI.

Download the drivers from
http://estebanordano.com/sis-m671m672-driver-for-xorg-xserver-7-5-on-debian-sidux/
(take the install files), unzip them

once unzipped copy or move them (I just copied them)

Open up a terminal and go to the path you've unzipped them in.(use the
cd command to navigate to directory's) f.e; cd /home/user/Downloads

Code:
sudo cp sis671_drv.* /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/

Code:
type in your password and press enter

then stop X
We need to stop X or we won't be able to auto-generate a xorg.conf.new

Code:
sudo service gdm stop

you'll have to do next part blindly)

Code:
Switch to tty1 by pressing Ctrl+Alt+f1
(f2 for tty2, f3 for tty3, etc.. (f7 should be X)

Even though you won't be able to read it (yet) you can login
Code:
type in your username and press enter
Code:
type in your password and press enter

Now you're logged in you want to become root; type;

Code:
sudo bash

Code:
type in your password

Now your root; type in
Code:
Xorg -configure
(this will create a xorg.conf.new in your home directory)

and start gdm again with

Code:
service gdm start
Once there; Open up a terminal again;
move the auto-generated xorg.conf.new to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
with

Code:
sudo mv xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf
and restart gdm by typing;

Code:
sudo service gdm restart

now go to /etc/X11 there a file named "xorg.conf" will be created with
all display properties. In that file you will have all display modes
which is available, now what you have to do is create a new mode for
what resolution you need. if you need help in configuring
xorg.conf,paste the content of that file in your reply. Be careful, if
you wrongly configured xorg.conf then you cannot enter into GUI unless
reinstall or repair of os.

hi.
I am having canon LBP2900B model printer and using ubuntu 10.04.
downloaded driver for my model from canon site. download consists of
cndrvcups-common.deb,cndrvcups-capt.deb files.
when installing cups-common got this.

root@balaji-desktop:/media/SETUP/linux

dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of cndrvcups-common:
 cndrvcups-common depends on libcupsys2 (>= 1.1.23); however:
  Package libcupsys2 is not installed.
dpkg: error processing cndrvcups-common (--install):

it shows i need to install libcupsys2,so tried to install
libcupsys2,it gives the following

root@balaji-desktop:/media/SETUP/linux

Note, selecting libcups2 instead of libcupsys2
libcups2 is already the newest version.
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 351 not upgraded.

on google i found that libcupsys2 renamed as libcups2, but the
cups-common drives needs to satisfy libcupsys2 dependency.
now on google found "we have to satisfy libcupsys2 name dependency
only and it is not functionally needed,so download and install dummy
package libcupsys2 from security.ubuntu.com."
downloaded libcupsys2 and tried to install. then

root@balaji-desktop:/home/balaji/Downloads# dpkg -i libcupsys2.deb
dpkg: regarding libcupsys2.deb containing libcupsys2:
 libcups2 conflicts with libcupsys2 (<< 1.3.7-6)

dpkg: error processing libcupsys2.deb (--install):

Errors were encountered while processing:
 libcupsys2.deb

libcups2 conflicts with libcupsys2, i tried to remove libcups2 and
install libcupsys2 but libcups2 is needed for lot of other
applications. so i cant remove libcups2.

What can i do now?

What can you do now?

Are there alternatives for installing the exact printer driver? I have
never used CUPS for printing.

Well I have never owned a personal printer till now.

Try LPRng.

Try LDP.

$ nc -v $printerip 515

Is it a USB printer with no Ethernet port?

Can you install some other generic driver? Perhaps it is a postscript printer?

I think normally only high end printers support postscript.

The other thing is that normally in a Debian system(on which *buntu is
based), once you get
dependency problems you are mostly on your own.

It is a tall order and their package management system though the best
in the Linux world is quite
 a sore area.

Moreover Debian suffers from oldness.

Not sure about Ubuntu though.

X compilation has always been a problem.

Xorg made is simpler but even then it is no easy job.

It is modular but it still is quite dependent on many many many things.

Do you use some exotic hardware or something?

 This may have something to do with kernel modesting. Look at

Please post the topics (whatever confirmed) early. This will help people to plan. In my opinion the schedule should be announced atleast 10 days in advance.

If the files you need to exclude cannot be expressed as a simple shell glob, I 
would use something like:

find <src> -name "[pattern]" -o -name "[pattern]" -exec cp {} <dest> \;

or something like:

cp -r `find <src> | egrep -v "(patterns|to|exclude)"` <dest>

However, if this is something you do regularly, I'd suggest using rsync instead. 
Do a man rsync and check opts like --exclude.


cheers,
- steve

Hi Viky

Is it that simple to use Reliance Netconnect using wvdial? I was
wondering how to go about connecting my NetBSD laptop.

Any special configs in wvdial.conf? Stupid mode or things like that?

May I have a sample of your wvdial.conf?

Our initiative of setting up FOSS lab is just a begining, and also to mark
an end for the proprietary software in technical/engineering education.

I know many acer users - most models are 100% linux compatible and work
very well with fedora. I have heard of Acers coming with OpenSuse that
works out of the box, but not recently. Most of us have bought Acer with
linpus linux, which we remove at once. For more expensive Acers they
compell you to buy windows also.

Yes it is. You need to install the packages usb-modeswitch and
usb-modeswitch-data and then run the following command to make the device to
be recognised as modem, not mass storage.

          modprobe usbserial vendor=0x19d2 product=0xfff1

My wvdial.conf is as follows:

[Dialer Defaults]
Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0
Init = ATZ
Phone = #777
Username = <My username>
Password = <My password>
New PPPD = 1
Stupid Mode = 1
Tonline = 0

Note: The username and password are same as the MDN number of your device.

HTH.

Here, the value for 'vendor' depends on the vendor of the modem (ZTE or
Huawei). The above is for ZTE.
The command 'lsusb' will show the value for your device.

viky@viky-desktop:~$ lsusb
Bus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub

Personally I would go for  a DELL. You can call customer care and ask them
for a system without Windows OS. Worth giving a try since this would save
you a couple of grand. The reason is their service quality and rugged-ness.
Also works well with Linux.

Remember to ask for an extended warranty since *accidental* damage is also
covered in the warranty.

Hi,

I've always wanted an open source client for Xen and VMWare. I was delighted
when I found this. Yet to find a VMWare Vsphere client alternative.

OpenXenManager (aka OpenXenCenter) is a client application to connect to the

Download from SVN: *svn co
https://openxenmanager.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openxenmanageropenxenmanager
*

or from the sourceforge repositrory.

To Install (Distro Agnostic):


   - Download and Uncompress the source file.
   - From terminal, run python frontend.py

Hope this helps someone.

I use an Acer and (travelmate 6292) and it gets really really hot after even
30 minutes of usage. Sometimes when I run some long running scripts, the CPU
temperature rises above 85 deg C!!! Then I get nervous and place it right
under the blast of an a/c.

Though I have not measured, my guesstimate of the surface temp around the
touchpad is around 40-50 deg C. Unfortunately, I came across reviews of its
'hotness' only after I bough it :-). Now I have learned to live with a
constant burning sensation in my fingertips!

I have another Acer (and Aspire) which is also hot. So, if its going to see
heavy usage, I would not reccomend Acer.

I would suggest that you consider some core i5 processor m/c because I
remember reading its more power efficient - and hence less heat!

Check the head of your admin dashboard page. The charset should be UTF-8.

Is there any easy at run time to dump very large binary structures at runtime , becos we have lots and lots variables inside structures and also ?which are?pointing to pointers to other structures, array of pointers ??

?
struct new_struct

?
int a ;

struct new_struct *p1;

}
?
like this it goes on lots? and lots of structures inside , some are linked lists , some are array of pointers, some are pointing other structures ? etc .
?
i need to have simple mechanism to dump the structures and thier values at runtime? to view values holding for me .
?
i dont want to use too many?printfs
?
it will save a lot of time in debugging and looking the entire structure to test the data .

You can directly install the chromium browser from the synaptic package
manager. It will install the latest version.

Even it is older version you can upgrade it to newer version. you actually
no need to download the latest version deb package and install it. Just
upgrading the older version will do.

Subject: [Ilugc] Why local user group,
	its time for GCI (Group for common Interest) too
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=xiAf2LL53HgimovDvDVCksshs3037agd127e2@mail.gmail.com>

In India, we have LUG for many place/institutes. culture is almost same. One
thing I am not happy is we all repeat same thing again and again. For
example If somebody is facing a problem in Ubuntu and he ask in his local
user group and try to solve the problem. Or If there is a some generic
purpose email then we try to forward in every daam possible mailing lists.
If their is a generic email then post on FOSSCOMM mailing
list<http://lists.fosscom.in/listinfo.cgi/network-fosscom.in>or if
there is a discussion for meeting/workshop then post on local user
group. Also, why post job email to every daam possible mailing list where
fossjobs.in is or fossyellopages (by LFY) is doing good job.

We must setup interest based learning group. for example , a Indian HTML5
user grou<http://mail.openwebindia.org/mailman/listinfo/openwebindia_openwebindia.org>p
, Ubuntu India or Fedora India.. We must setup Interest based mailing list
like Drupal User group, Arduino user group india, PhpLovergroup India, So
that we can see focused and common interest based people thus meetups and
thus workshop/seminar like Delhi Drupal meetup 1,2,... etc.

You can start creating Interest based groups on facebook  like
PHP Programmer group on
facebook<http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_153904971318569&ap=1>,
or just
Programmers <http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_155844017784862&ap=1>etc...
Select whatever medium you want like twitter or orkut or mailing
list..
mailing list might be heavy for this purpose.. I am talking about small but
dedicated teams... If team is big like "Drupal user group" then mailing is
Ok.


The purpose of GCI (Group for common Interest) is to create a small platform
- says 3-4 but dedicated people who are want to learn or want expertness in
a given area and actively participate. More or less I am talking about Small
or medium sized activity based interest groups..

It is very useful in virtualization?

qemu for instance.

$ qemu-img create filestore.bin 40G

I can only see truncate(2) in section 2 of the man page in OpenBSD.

Too bad.TRUNCATE(2)               OpenBSD Programmer's Manual
    TRUNCATE(2)

NAME
     truncate, ftruncate - truncate or extend a file to a specified length

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     int
     truncate(const char *path, off_t length);

     int
     ftruncate(int fd, off_t length);

DESCRIPTION
     truncate() causes the file named by path or referenced by fd to be
     truncated or extended to length bytes in size.  If the file was larger
     than this size, the extra data is lost.  If the file was smaller than
     this size, it will be extended as if by writing bytes with the value
     zero.  With ftruncate(), the file must be open for writing.

I recommend you to read this book. This very nice book beginner can
get good info about Linux System Programming.
Linux System Programming : Talking Directly to the Kernel and C
Library By Robert Love

Again speed reading will not going to help you. You have to have much
more understanding of C Programming, Data Structure and Linux
Internals. I you are not strong in those three areas, better to learn
first those skill, then try to learn system programming. Success will
dependents on your Practice, Dedication and Passion.

Nearly 4500+ packages from Fedora-13 repository (refer the fedora-13

Hi there,

   - Somehow am unable to connect to airtel broadband using beetel 220 modem
   provided in ubuntu 10.10,
   - i googled for it but failed
   - one evident solution came in IRC #ubuntu-in , where i was told to put
   DNS server addresses in /etc/resolv.conf to google DNS servers,
   - this worked out in a way that am able to ping to www.google.com (its
   obvious),
   - but in browser(firefox) am unable to connect to internet.
   - I followed the instructions given at honeytechwell and zyxware but
   failed.

Is there any other solution, i dont have wireless modem.

Why only Fedora ? why not popular linux distributions like ubuntu ?
or debian ? with ~30k packages ???
infact debian/ubuntu offers much more choices for packages for
students. Debian has been very popular with scientific community.
many people are no aware of such a wide variety of choice  until one
looks at the categorized package list in debian/ubuntu.
These lab setups are a good opportunity to create awareness on such a
choice also I guess.

Well there is little use if sys admins  set up themselves. It should
be an interactive environment where everyone participates and learns.
it is more imp to get the message straight to the people by hands on
practise.

yeap, that should be the ideal case.

we should provide them option to choose what distro they want to use.
I would suggest to use cobbler and put 3-4 distro's and ask student's
for their choice of distro and install on fly.

dd can also be used to achieve a similar effect.

Well, I may be wrong here, but setting up FOSS lab might be OP's
fulltime job. He has total rights to do want he wants and how he wants
to do his job. Free advice is easy.

Atleast, I won't be very happy when someone else tells me what to do in my job.

You are right. Baskar does this as full time business. I agree with your point.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinPsuWg0-R7WC=Esr_2QLgB1E5cccPM=Y5VW-Qj@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all
 i am copying files from one folder to another folder

 while copying i am using the following command.

 cp  ?pvr  oldfolder/
 /var/www/vhosts/newsite/httpdocs/app/webroot/newfolder/

 so the permission and the owner and groups are retained

 now i want to change (recursively) the owner and group of the newfolder/
 to a new owner and group
for example
 if it has like this...

 /var/www/vhosts/newsite/httpdocs/app/webroot/newfolder/

     myflles/             777 (rights)      wonder (owner)
 psgrp (group)

     ro/                    755                  apache
        apache

     de/                   777                  wonder
       apache

     one.jpg             777                  wonder
     psgrp

     two.jpg            755                   apache
     apache


after using the chown (newwonder) and chgrp (newpsgrp) , i wanted  to as
below.

 /var/www/vhosts/newsite/httpdocs/app/webroot/newfolder/

     myflles/             777 (rights)      newwonder (owner)
newpsgrp  (group)

     ro/                    755                  apache
        apache

     de/                   777                  newwonder
     apache

     one.jpg             777                  newwonder
   newpsgrp

     two.jpg            755                   apache
     apache


so hope you understand..

like i want to change the owner and group of the newly copied folder
(newfolder) if and only if the owner was wonder and group was psgrp. (in
other words not to change the owner and group if it was .. apache )

Thanks

I might be over-complicating, but you can do this like so:

ls -la | grep -v apache | awk '{print $8}' | xargs chown newwonder:psgrp

You can probably change that a bit to get what you want.

you are hundred percent right - what OP needs is people to help to train

Your attitude sounds gives me a feeling of a  monotonous lab setup (as
seen with windows based lab setups).

Well I agree It is definitely a great effort to do FOSS lab setups in
engg colleges or institutions. But what really matters at the end of
the day is-  howmany people/students have u motivated to use FOSS
based applications ? and how many labs continue to use those
installations ? Are they confident enough to try and /or  motivated to
install FOSS applications on their PCs  at home ?
If FOSS lab setups can address these questions seriously then these
efforts will be very fruitful.

KM

I bought 2 laptop -
1) Benq Eco - with Linus and ubuntu and other were having a lot of problems
2) Acer some model - with lipus - works great only brightness do not work

Gaurav Paliwal (a friend of mine) purchased acer with limpus and faced a lot
of problem.

Let me correct myself..
Having Linpus Linux Or any command line Linux preinstalled do
not guarantee that Ubuntu or fedora or all hardware will work fine.

Better solution --  Go with Preinstall Ubuntu or Fedora or Debian or
anyother Distro which give a full fledge running system..
In my registered company(ELPA Tech) I will sell Linux Pre-installed Laptops.
but that is under process and will take some more month.

I totally agree with  bala. I have done more than 75 sessions in the last 5-6 years. The state of affairs is so poor that just letting the word 'foss' or 'linux' to be heard by the students itself is a great service to foss.  Baskar is doing wonderful job.

Today our requirement is 'physical volunteers' and not adivse/suggestion/ideas. We need foot solders, we have enough commanders, strategic planners, thinkers, analysts etc.

there is also another point. I was fortunate enough to be invited by
Baskar to take a one day workshop in one of the labs he has set up. This
was in Kongu and I got a lab with 45 shiny new fedora machines. This was
a great help since I could demo on one machine and the students could
easily follow since the all had the same configuration. For example -
editor. I told them to open geany, and got 45 geanys available. So they
could concentrate on following what I was doing instead of getting
confused. I remember teaching one workshop where some had geany and
others had only gedit. 'sir, how to do this in gedit?' How would I know?
I would have to go to that workstation and waste my time figuring out
how to do it in gedit. 

and also in a lab where there is interactive teaching going on it is
cool to have exactly the same install on all machines. I remember once
teaching a class with fedora in some machines, ubuntu in others. So I
show them how to setup something and the ubuntu guys jump up 'sir it is
not importing' - I tell them put it in site-packages. 'sir there is no
site-packages in my machine'. My jaw drops, I have used numerous
distros, *BSDs and MacOSX - and *all* of them including earlier versions
of ubuntu have a site-packages directory. Then I spend 20 minutes to
find out that for some unknown reason these people have a dist-packages
directory!!

yes, I know that a person who has not used at least three distros is
unfit to be called a linux user. But not for beginners. And certainly it
is a huge waste of the teacher's time to handle multiple distros - it
diverts attention from the task at hand.

find is a pretty powerful tool, you should learn its option if you want be good 
at sysadmin/shell scripting. Some of the most useful search options are:

-name
-iname
-mtime
-type
-size
-perm
-maxdepth/-mindepth

and the action options:
-exec
-delete
-print/-printf

and of course the operators to combine search options "-a", "-o" and "!"

coolness - I have been using find for the last 15 years without knowing

I guess ur talking abt python's dist-packages/site-packages dir.
Now this is  an application specific issue.
The application configuration files/dirs etc and their locations do
change between distros. we all know that.
But one should have taken these differences into account beforehand.

Really!!? Thats a very strange definition of a linux user !
Well its not waste of teacher's time, but I would rather say - its
just a lack of preparation for the demo.
What is the point  if one is unable to address the basic issues like
using editor(gedit/geany) raised in a demo session ?

What is the achievement out of those 75 sessions ? Do u mean that the
students do not care abt FOSS the day after the lab setup ? If so
whats the point in doing the whole thing? Are you sure they still use
FOSS in their labs ?

I think you are missing an important point. physical volunteers could
be generated from the students/audience themselves, if motivated
enough to use FOSS.

It is not that easy KM. If your time permits, you can volunteer to go
for a couple of sessions and try your methods. Baskar would be happy
to have all the help we can provide.

With the introduction of FOSS in university syllabus, the demand from
the colleges for FOSS teaching has grown. Generally, their focus is
ONLY to cover the syllabus and pass exams.

If you have too many files, then invoking chown for every match will
be slow.  For large data sets, I combine xargs like this:
    find <opts>  -print0 | xargs -0 chown newowner:newgroup


Another neat usage for find is to recursively list file details:
    find -ls

Filter this output with awk/grep and can quickly select interesting files,
import this into a spread sheet as delimited text, etc.

Isn't there a way to type say 10, 1's?
If I press alt+1+0+1 it will take it as alt+101

My two cents. I have a Dell N4010 and since I have bought it I am facing lot
of trouble working with linux.
First: No linux distro(keep Mandriva away) detected it's network card out of
the box.
Second: the fan speed increases abruptly and the temperature goes haywire
(though I am still struggling to get some utility working on it for
measuring temperature-this is off topic though : )

So just check the compatibility issues of various components before
deciding.

How many Non-free software is on your machine ?

$ vrms

tell you how many Non free software is on your machine, which package
it is and which restriction on freedom it has . require vrms package ,
vrms mean virtual Richard M. Stallman ;-)

$ vrms
The program 'vrms' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
sudo apt-get install vrms


sathia@ubuntu:~$ vrms
              Non-free packages installed on ubuntu

skype                     Skype

              Contrib packages installed on ubuntu

flashplugin-installer     Adobe Flash Player plugin installer
nvidia-common             Find obsolete NVIDIA drivers

 1 non-free packages, 0.1% of 1517 installed packages.
 2 contrib packages, 0.1% of 1517 installed packages.


or if your machine is 100 % free software :

 No non-free or contrib packages installed on ubuntu !!! RMS would be proud. :-)

K & R C.

Not a great book to start with but  a good book to end with.

After that you use online resources.

UNIX Programming environment is also good.

Remember, C is great. C++ is not.

So stop with C.

I suppose you are talking about closed source software? Yes, that is not

Dear Luggies,

After a while when I get time I will make it more accessible to

hi,

those of us that use an extra monitor will have faced a problem when the
power goes down. The extra monitor goes down also. I have firefox on the
extra monitor and cannot see it. All I need to do is unplug the extra
monitor from the laptop - firefox at once jumps to my laptop screen.
When power comes up - plug in the extra monitor and firefox jumps back.
Cool no?

 stale NFS problem will occur only when you have nfs mounted file system. 
Is your home mounted through NFS from somewhere? Please post 
a. output of mount command
b. your /etc/fstab file
c. You are talking about test.tmpl and test.html. Post ls -l for these files

Please also note: fsck is not the panacea for all file system ills.

The only thing that C++ adds on top of C is OO (and of course
a revamp of standard libraries to follow the OO semantic). The
best part is - its so flexible that you are not forced into designing
your project in OO model.

How can that be bad ?

That will only limit knowledge within one domain. A good programmer
or developer in my opinion must learn many languages - only then
would he be able to make justified decisions in choosing the right
tool/language for a particular project/task.

From the above it is clear that your file system has some corruption. You may try seting ownership and permssion to this file, though I am doubtful about its use. Also note that the file name is test..tmp and not test.tmpl as you think.

I pretty much doubt if anything useful can be attempted at this stage. Why did you run fsck earlier?

Again sorry, the file is test.tmpl only.
If my file system has some corruption, then my system would have been in
danger in future. So may i reinstall my OS ??

Thats the main point. it looks like there is no one enough motivated
from the audience ! Does it mean I am doing great service if I have
organized more FOSS events than those 75 events in 5 years ? thats a
bizzare comparison.
I am not in india right now. so I am unable to take part in these
activities. I am trying to understand what and how people are trying
to spread FOSS usage these days as i see many labsetups in engg
colleges popping up often in the mailing list.
It would be very helpful if the event  organizers can tell what they
have done and the students/audience feedback  rather than flashing
number of events organized and thinking themselves, that itself is  a
great service. this is not a true spirit. Infact it reminds me of the
number of tv sets given away by the government; probably for people's
upliftment ! All I say is that Its more imp to see how many people are
still using FOSS for their work ; number of events have no meaning. I
feel ur  not answering these questions in the labsetups.

I don't understand what was the comparision in my post which is bizzare.
I repeat again, if you feel you can motivate better nothing stops you from doing it - the main point you want to address.

I am sure you will be visting India frequently, you are welcome to participate at that time.

Everybody has limits. In these type of things, service however small it may be it should be welcomed.

We cannot be posting the video recording of 6-8 hours we spend in various colleges, just to prove that we are working. We do address all these issues. Enough people are getting motivated, that is why you see good number of newbies in our list.  There are many offlist queries/phonecalls/personal contacts we have with students. We don't want spam the list with every such details just to prove ourself.

Please do understand we do this for our satisfaction, not to satisfy somebody.

Note that this is a Debian specific package and only applicable for
Debian and derivatives.  I took  a look at it a few years back but it is
too tied to the package format and not portable across distributions.

vrms is specifically written for debian. It is basically a single perl
script which uses
dpkg to get the installed packages information. Further it uses a list
of blacklisted package
names(debian specific names) in an accompanying file.

In short, the package vrms as such cannot be installed in a
non-debian(derivative) distros _trivially_.

If you want to port, do:
git clone https://alioth.debian.org/anonscm/git/vrms/vrms.git

Another alternative is maybe, to make the target distro dpkg based -
But that is too much for installing just
one package !

If you don't care about money then nothing can beat Lenovo ThinkPad R

In most engg. colleges, the choice of distro is mainly decided by sys.
admins / lab assistants (their most preferred choice is RedHat/Fedora).

As I remember, the above question is already addressed in one of the threads
in ilugc.  As I tried creating
a kickstart for Ubuntu and requested for help, nobody in the list replied to
that mail (Most often what i get is, only free advice and not any serious
help for my requests in supporting the initiative)

I spend only limited time in colleges (i have to start the foss lab setup as
early by 9.30 a.m. and complete by 4.30 - 5.00 pm for nearly 60 computers
installed with 4524 rpm packages).

In fact, many of the colleges who already have RedHat/Ubuntu linux,
requested me to remove the existing installation and asked me to install
fedora, as they have all the required applications right after the
installation.

Now, I am involved in the process of implementing foss lab setup for 70+
engg. colleges in the coimbatore region before January 15th.  Many of my
students (even the suppliers/vendors of the institutions) are volunteering
this initiative by sparing their valuable time for me.

Now, 6 engg. colleges have requested for Faculty Development Programme on
FOSS in the month of December (all at the same time). I am really finding it
difficult to get qualified trainers for successfully conducting these FDPs.

My humble request to this list is, stop giving free advises and support our
initiative if possible.

As many engg. colleges have bought our FOSS lab server, we provide nearly
20+ major distributions (all major distro listed in distrowatch.com) with
complete repositories of those distributions.  If any college prefers a
different distro, they have their choice to choose from.

In fact the complete kernel source repository of size 45GB (from historic
kernel 0.01 to 2.6.36 is available in our foss lab server). Yesterday a
Asst. Professor in a Engineering college had a look in to the linux kernel
source code, and his opinion is, open source is the way to learn/teach in
engg. colleges as the students would learn more from open source software)

Now things are completely changing here in engg. colleges.  By 2012,
GNU/Linux will be the primary operating system of choice in engg. colleges
in Tamilnadu.

Only the college management / staffs / students can answer for the above. If
possible, pl. come along with me for the institutions we have been supporing
(now exceeding more than 200+ colleges) and you can get the feedback for the
above from them.

In the coming years, there won't be any specific FOSS labs in engg.
colleges, as all the labs will be running with FOSS. (see my next mail
regarding this).

That's because there is no space taken by the file on the disk. IIRC, the 
original tip was about creating sparse files which also included a link to what 
a sparse file meant.

Anyways, you can try `du -bh` to get what you expect to see.

du provides the actual disk usage by default. If you want the
apparent size the --apparent-size option can be used

$ du --apparent-size -h f

Both the actual and apparent disk usage are available through
the stat() system call.

off_t     st_size;    /* total size, in bytes */
...
blkcnt_t  st_blocks;  /* number of blocks allocated */

st_size is the apparent size and st_blocks is the
actual size (in blocks).

Vijay

 Engineering College, Namakkal District
Message-ID: <AANLkTikjhtv1CK4htFoU6Ym0TJDDGq5J836hZe0SZTOt@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Yesterday (12/11/10), we setup a 60 seat FOSS lab in Muthayammal Engineering
College, Namakkal District, (http://www.muthayammal.ac.in/) for the
department of CSE using Fedora-13.

After starting the lab setup,* *I had a brief discussion with HOD/CSE Mr.
Senthil Kumar and he requested for a guest lecture on FOSS for the 3rd year
students of CSE and I delivered a guest lecture with demonstrations using a
Fedora-13 desktop.

In the evening, we had a discussion with the Principal Dr. M.Madheswaran,
Secretary Mr. K. P. Ramaswamy regarding the open source implementation
throughout the institution.  The secretary expressed his idea of
implementing open source software throughout the institution as he wants to
make better use of the existing IT infrastructure by their students.  It was
decided to convert many of the labs to open source software from the next
semester/academic year.

Everyone in this institutions is very interested / enthusiastic about open
source software.  The foss lab setup was done by lecturers, sys. admins, lab
assistants (as I was simply watching the whole thing).

 A Faculty Development programme on FOSS is planned for the dept. staffs
between December 13-17.

For any details, pl. contact Mr. Bhaskaran, Asst. Professor/CSE
(98421-49872), Mr. Senthil Kumar, HOD/CSE (90474-34069).

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=hKj9=-FBZPWT=rdi3LgfDvoCHre4rE2f-fov8@mail.gmail.com>

Lock the hardware eject button of the cdrom

$ eject -i 1

This command will lock the hardware eject button of your cdrom drive.
Some uses are:

1: If you have a toddler and has discovered the cdrom button

2: If you are carrying a laptop in a bag or case and don't want it to
eject if the button is inadvertently pressed.

To unlock the button use:

$ eject -i 0

For more info see the "eject" man page.


Ex:

sathia@ubuntu:~$ eject -i 1
CD-Drive may NOT be ejected with device button
sathia@ubuntu:~$ eject ( see the reaction )
sathia@ubuntu:~$ eject -i 0
CD-Drive may be ejected with device button
sathia@ubuntu:~$ eject ( now see the reaction )

hi,

the second meet of ilugcbe took place on the 13th. Turnout was a little
low - only about 50 people, but this was due to the fact that Amrita
University is in a very remote location, so many people could not make
it. The meeting was lively, and there was a very interesting discussion
as the Amrita faculty were describing how they are trying to replicate
an open source environment within the local LAN for students to get used
to collaborative working. The key problem they face is: if students
collaborate, how does one give grades/marks to individual students?
Other problems are things like blocked IRC and the reluctance of the
sysadmins to permit students to recompile the kernel of their systems.
There was also a moonlit meeting with students and faculty in the
children's park. If all goes well we will be conducting a conference
some time next year ...

Hi Baskar,

I am really sorry that nobody replied to that email.

btw. I have used cobbler [ https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/ ] in a
production environment ( 300+ Servers) .
Please have a look at the screenshot.
https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/attachment/wiki/CobblerWebInterface/Screenshot.png.
This will enable Lab admin to easily manage workstation imaging,
re-imaging , adding new Kickstart file or editing kickstart file or
using specific kickstart file for specific workstation or server and
it's limit less.

With combination of cobbler and func [ https://fedorahosted.org/func/
], you can maintain unified packages,users and what not.
Please have a look at the FAQ in
https://fedorahosted.org/func/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestionsAndTroubleshooting.

Both are fedora projects. I have personally tested RHEL4,5, CentOS in
production environment and automated installation for apache
webservers, mail servers and even oracle 11i db servers.

let me know if you have any questions,

Regards,

Vijai .G

For Emacs:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(emacs)Arguments
    You can use a numeric argument to insert multiple
    copies of a character.  This is straightforward unless
    the character is a digit.  To prevent the digit from
    becoming part of the argument, type another `C-u'.
    That terminates the argument.  If you then type another
    digit, then the digit acts as a self-inserting
    character and uses the argument as a repeat count.

For Bash, there doesn't seem to be a way to do this.

Dear luggies
There was a discussion about student project yestdays meeting. Most students ask what project to do. I found ubuntu brainstorm site to be very useful for getting new ideas. Here is the link
http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/

For example look at following idea
http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/26406/
Here there is a proposal for building a gui for compiling kernel. 
Though many may not prefer such tool, it should be good exercise to student.

I think stale NFS is a very common case when  network outage or some
such thing cause.

You can get rid of it by unmounting it forcibly(-f flag to mount) and
then remounting it.

NFS has always had problems.

Version 3 is better (even version 4 exists) and you can experiment with it.

Normally NFS mounted file systems are not fscked, hence the /etc/fstab
entries 0 0 meaning that you cannot fsck them.

Just thought of asking if you have a solution for a similar problem I
face. I use
a extended monitor at my workplace(monitor as the only display screen). When
I suspend the laptop and power it on without the monitor it gives a
blank screen. I
have to type the password blind folded and everything will appear in
the latop screen.

To avoid this I make sure laptop screen is the only screen used before
suspending
it. Has anyone faced this problem ? Is there a better solution for this ?

why do you not use the laptop screen also? frankly I cannot understand

Yes, Perl takes 4 years.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinrf0+14zwidG-jmHoVLHpCMzA00B4Ajgy=P2C9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to know if it is possible for someone to gain access to resources if
they capture a person's encrypted password.

For Eg:

Gmail uses https once the authentication process starts. This is basically
to ensure that if anyone is listening on the network he gets garbled text.
So if a person is able to emulate the session and send the encrypted
password with my user-id... will he gain access to my gmail account?

Regards,
Ashish

In https, the entire session is encrypted -not the individual fields. So you
cannot see what the password field's value is. As for a person submitting
stolen encrypted data, even if the server returns something, he cannot do
much with it because he will not have the key to unencrypt it. Though am not
sure if the server will even respond - just thinking aloud!

Indeed. But it depends on how long the https encryption is on. Most 
sites, Gmail & Facebook included, turn on https only during login. So 
though the password etc. are encrypted, but if the user is able to 
capture the session cookie (say in a public wi-fi hotspot), he can still 
impersonate you and can do whatever he wants. This is the whole premise 
of the controversial Firesheep (http://codebutler.com/firesheep). And of 
course, then you should also read up about Blacksheep. A few sites like 
GitHub have gone fully-https in advent of this. Most of them are yet to, 
mostly because it means significant changes to their network 
infrastructure.

That said, I'm no security researcher, perhaps somebody with experience 
in this domain can give more insights on this.

I was a perl programmer for about 7 years - even then I was unable to
organise a single meet up although there were many perl people in those
days. I these days people have moved on - although we have a genuine
expert in Raman - any doubts posted will be clarified here

I am certainly not an expert. Basic perl is simple like c. We need to learn what is required for our work.  Problem comes only when we mix application of perl with basic perl e.g. mastering all modules etc..
Even after 10 years I am not confident will all power of perl regex, but I don't bother because my development doesn't need much of regex.

In tamil they say 'Nizhalin arumai veyyilil therium' - 'coolness of shadow is realised only under sun'.

As Larry Wall the founder of perl said, look at its strength, if suitable use it. It has its own strength and weakness.

Coming to the other part - I am willing to organise one or two days event on perl. Can we?

Hi,

I would think that's because nobody is learning perl anymore. These days only 
old perl programmmers exist. That's because in this age of quick cpus, fast net 
connections, and UIs for everything from network configuration to backup tools, 
there is no real reason to learn perl. Especially since the advent of easier and 
altogether more fun languages like python.

It is very true. In fact even after years of toil when you become a perl monk it 
takes a long time to understand perl code (Ex:some yrs) :D

Seriously though, my personal opinion is perl is a _very_ easy language to 
_learn_, although becoming proficient at it will take a long time (as an aside: 
you would also need to sacrifice the notions of clarity, beauty and ultimately 
sanity, to become /really/ good).

If you *really* want to learn perl, my recommendation is first learn to script 
in bash[1], because it is only when you see why perl was born will you be able 
to appreciate it. Once you've done that you can pick up the camel book[2] which 
is the best book IMHO to get started.

I hope I can attend. I remember a lot of fun using perl. Only I had to
move away because I found it difficult using it when collaborative
development - it is fine for individual work.

Thanks Raman...yes, please. Is it going to be classroom training? if
yes, I look forward to that and would like to enroll (and as a
separate note, event in saturday/sunday is preferred)

right but one must remember there are large number of systems still
very much has Perl dependency in many investment banks/financial
institutions (not sure about other verticals/businesses) since the
migration (for example, Perl to Python) would take it's own course of
time and folks who are driving/working on that must know Perl in
detail for code review etc, to put it simpler: I still want to learn
and looking forward Raman's session/training event :)

as a side note, I think Simon Cozens _beginning-perl_ is also good
place to get started: http://www.perl.org/books/beginning-perl/ if you
have basic programming skills

Perl is extensively used for testing and automation. Two major domains
that come to my mind are:

* VLSI - test case implementation (verification and validation
engineers), and in
* Telecommunication systems.

Chennai is a major hub for pre-press and publishing outsourcing
in India.  The automation involved in this industry (XML/Word/Latex/etc
conversion) is extensively built using Perl.  The demand for good
Perl talent in this industry is ever growing over the past 10 years.

I had an app that took me about 4 years to develop in perl. I learnt
python and migrated the app in 2 weeks.

Perl is not dead. There is enough space for multiple languages to exist. Loot at http://search.cpan.org/recent to judge the number of modules created/updated every day. Certainly not all of them are written by old programmers. 
 Look at other projects like catalyst framework, webmin, bricolage, movabletype blog, mojolicious, foswiki,webgui cms etc., to see how alive it is.

Above all our KG's favourite search engine duckduckgo is also running on perl. I think another search engine blekko is also using perl.

Hopefully perl6 will come soon to set at rest all the doubts.

Ken, I agree but I meant the complex dependency with the number of other systems

Yes exactly. Python is a good choice if one is going to start learning
programming.
Infact  many institutions (like MIT) have made Python as defacto
language to introduce fundamentals of programming
for eg:http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-189-a-gentle-introduction-to-programming-using-python-january-iap-2008/

its not tough to learn. bu then its easy to write sphagettic code.
sometimes u might be surprised to look at ur own perl program and
unable to understand.

yes. reading others perl code to understand the flow is very difficult
 in perl. python addresses this limitation effectively which is
important in the long run when developing programs into  applications.

Well one does not need to know anything abt programing to start with
python. So if u havent programmed earlier, then give python a try- its
definitely worth fun.

Many telecommunication companies, like Alcatel,  in Chennai are
extensively using Perl for their internal testing. I used Agilent
tester for our network router testing, in that, for some of the custom
test plans, I have to use Perl.

In ILUGC Raman Sir is great source for Perl. Two year ago I had opportunity
to attend Raman Perl class. It helps me  more in my carrier.

I had opportunity to make some changes in Awstats Web analytics tool,  after
only I realized the power of Perl.

If you have good skill in C++ and Perl, you have lot of opportunity in

It depends on the protocol. If its a very simple protocol where the
initial authentication between the server and the client is only
encrypted (the remaining traffic after authentication is sent on the
clear) and no freshness (say a session key with an expiry time) is
used then whatever you say is possible. But I doubt anybody uses such
a protocol.

Gmail uses full https. The entire traffic is encrypted and is session
key based. So if someone does the relay attack (where the adversary
stores the encrypted traffic and replays it later on) to authenticate
himself, the session key would no longer be the same. So the server
(here gmail) will not be able to decrypt your message. If the attacker
does this during an active session (i.e. the session keys are still
valid), he will be able to send this emulated/stored encrypted traffic
and the server will validate it. But since the adversary does not know
the session key, he will receive back encrypted garbage which only the
"client" (with the correct session key) can decrypt. So again this is
not very useful.

And of course by the very nature of encryption (one way functions[1])
it is not possible/very hard to retrieve the key from an encrypted
data.

In short you are OK *in general*. But then one can do slightly
sophisticated attacks. IMO security is always an illusion :)

Hope this helps.

Commercial proxy/content-filtering solutions use SSL proxy
(fancy word for a man-in-the-middle-attack) and break open
HTTPS connections.  These devices terminate the HTTPS
connection on the proxy appliance itself, create a new HTTPS
connection to the server.  The SSL cert presented to the client
browser is generated on the proxy appliance and signed using
a custom CA.  If that CA is installed on your browser (through
corporate policy) there is no warning on the client browser that
your connection is terminated in between.

If the appliance re-signs the client side SSL cert using the
private keys of Verisign/Thwate/etc (Govt security organizations
have access to most CA private keys), this man-in-the-middle
attack is *very* hard to detect.

Netstat is the correct way. There are other ways of course, lsof,
fstat and so on.

Even sockstat(1) on BSD systems.

But netstat is the canonical way.

lsof is meant for tracing system calls.

And which process has which device file open.

Dear Members,

I have done successfully remote installation of fedora 14 using pxe,tftp,dhcp and nfs/http. The contents of the Fedora 14 DVD were copied into a particular directory and shared through nfs. I did it based on the article downloaded from the following link-

http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch25_:_Network-Based_Linux_Installation

However, I'am unable to do it with ISO images. I couldn't get proper articles to do the same. Kindly help me with the steps.

Secondly, I would like to know in remote installation which is more faster- DVD installation tree based or ISO image based.

This might help:

<http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/14/html/Installation_Guide/ch-Preparing-x86.html#s1-steps-network-installs-x86-nfs>

I highly recommend at least skimming through the guide and reading the relevant 
sections if you are new to Fedora.

I would imagine both would take approximately the same time, although tree based 
might be somewhat faster.

Now that we are being pedantic about stuff. Interleaved posting is the canonical 
way to post replies here. Consistent top posting means that either one has not

On Ubuntu, I use static DNS setting with DHCP for address only to resolve
this issue.

This is because your IP address is dynamic. Registered users of openDNS has
options to block websites of their interest. OpenDNS uses IP addresses to
enforce this. AFAIK they provide a client software to update the IP address
whenever it changes. I think some registered user had your current IP
address last time. Suggest you to either register with openDNS or restart
the router.

As suggested by Mohan Sundaram, do not edit resolv.conf (which is
re-generated by Network Manager in KDE) but set DNS in your Network
Manager (or other equivalent application of your desktop).

I have BSNL broadband and use 4.2.2.2 and 8.8.8.8 as DNS servers. Face
no problems as you describe.

We use twiki on the intranet for the same purpose and its very powerful.  I
am not sure of the specific requirements you have, but if a document
management system is what you are  looking for , you could check
Knowledgetree (http://www.knowledgetree.com/) and Alfresco (

Should not take more than 15 mins of your time to setup a
local DNS server.  Suggest you do this and solve this issue
once and for all.

problem is I am always travelling and have to keep recofiguring stuff to
accomodate the (often weird) setups in places I have to connect my
laptop. Anyway, one of these days I will do a yum install cacheing only
dns. I do not think it will take as long as 15 minutes.

In Debian I use dnsmasq and resolvconf packages.   Add entries to
/etc/hosts for "your servers" (hopefully they have static IP
addresses).  dnsmasq/resolvconf will take care of the rest.
Irrespective of your locations your specific servers will resolve
properly and for the rest the network's DNS servers will come into
play.

Alternately, run bind as a cacheing server (as you have indicated).
In most distros, you need to install the package and it pretty much
works out of the box.  Beyond the downloand/install time it should be
less than a couple of minutes to activate the service.

Any particular reason to avoid the above?

There are quite a few 4.2.2.x (x=1 to 6); I do use 4.2.2.4 and 4.2.2.6 though.

4.2.2.2 is the default secondary dns that bsnl provides - doesn't work.
As for 8.8.8.x, rms would not approve.

There are ISPs other than BSNL who suggest the same. 4.2.2.2 is a good
one to "test" a DNS setup. But it wouldn't be a good idea to use it on
a regular basis given that it is most likely a feature for customers
of Level3.

There are other public DNS available and, if recalling them is an
issue, they can always be noted down using the cellphone or, any other
conventional method.

I've been a reasonably happy (registered) user of OpenDNS on one of my
routers and, of Google's DNS on another. I do run a nameserver
(djbdns) for myself but not when I am using connections like
Netconnect from Reliance or, Photon as they seem to dislike such bits.

Having said that, I am not a general user. My network access points
are fairly well defined and, are in most cases configured by me. By
which I mean that I don't need to face the name resolution issues
Kenneth mentions related to using computers when on the move.

yes - you go to a typical sweatshop in Bengaluru. First they take away
your usb modem. Then they give you 'net access' where everything is
blocked, and it takes half an hour to configure access - and it does not
work. Then, since you are a golf buddy of the MD, they give you 'special
direct access'. All this accompanied by the regular sound of whips
falling on the code coolies ... not very conducive to freedom and foss.

Or edit the /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf to add the different DNS IP addresses.
prepend domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;

Fyi, this is mentioned in the homepage of nonameconf
http://nonameconf.in/ under the Operating Principles heading. So you
have to ask the organizers of the conference about that quote. If you
have hammer in your hand (the intent to sling mud on someone)
everything will appear as a nail!

Please do not defend the mistake. Accept that you slipped once and move on :-)

(who will decide what is serious and what is non serious? the poster?
then you allow everyone to use sms speak)

+1. What if someone top posts for non-serious stuff, will we remain
silent? Btw, is this mail chain a flame bait? ;)

look - I spent the last 5 years trying to enforce rules on this list. I

Good , so you will be enjoying your freedom as well .  I wonder what
bought that change in you .
Well enjoy the SMS/IM lingo to the core . you can start at
http://hffo.cuna.org/12433/article/2048/html for a basic tutorial .
Hang around #ubuntu on freenode and other similar channels to catch
such lingo as it goes on :)

Seriously, we do not appreciate useful work. But, we criticise
anything we find irritating immediately.

Even though Kenneth is criticised by some for his policing, his
enforcement of rules keep the list serious and alive. In that sense,
he has succeeded for the good of community.

My only request is to be a little gentle on non-deliberate (new
members) offenders, if possible. Even without that enforcement of
rules is definitely needed.

That is my opinion.

Hi

I joined ILUGC very recently.

I am using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS - the Lucid Lynx

I am not able to go into the virtual terminals ( CTRL+ ALT + F1,
etc..) : the screen stays black with a lone blinking cursor at around
the  top left of the screen. CTRL + ALT + F7 takes me back to X.

I searched onto the ubuntu forums which suggested that I need to

1) remove the splash
2) add vga = 792

in the /boot/grub/menu.lst file.

Tried that, restarted, but nothing changed. Can you please shed some
light on this.

	#nsisodiya
Message-ID: <AANLkTimWG_YpKyS9_vPuYDNoCKG0j4MymWw6wFUg0Ygz@mail.gmail.com>

Here is the first and short blog on my first company "*ELPA Technologies*".
(no website).
       ELPA is an Indian Company, It is registered as "Proprietary Firm" for
Hardware & Software Sells and FLOSS consultancy. I am operating from Delhi
and northern region. I initially trying to have a Non-profit
structure<http://schoolwiki.eduvid.in/en/index.php?title=Main_Page>and
getting earning from it.  but Now I have decided to have a fully
for-profit company rather then depending on Grants/Donations from Govt or
other things as in India getting money is not an easy task(at-least for
me).  Also more important I want to become independent so that I can do my
RnD work in FOSS.
       Apart for giving training and consultancy to some security projects I
am looking forward to service like pre-installed Linux Desktop and Laptop
where you will get everything working perfectly+1 year service contract.
Mass installation of Linux in school colleges etc. Same time I am looking
for giving development of HTML5/ajax/ based application (because i don't
want to loose my expert development skillset). There is a huge list of
things which i can perform well..

        *My vision is clear : "To support FOSS/Linux as much as I can and
getting money from it"*

right now, I have two office : Delhi (Malviya Nagar) & Bhopal (Madhya
Pradesh ).

So If you have such kind of requirement in your company , college or startup
then you ask for quotation.

PS: I am already associate with many non-profit work, like LUG@IITD,
SchoolOS & Its community development, Project Eduvid , fossjobs.in and many
other things. These will not be affected as I will be working on these
project too. I am making a strong commitment to give 20% resource (money,
man-power etc) to all such community related projects. All those student who
worked me for various projects can ask for certification now. New pool of
student who want to learn Linux and develop foss project can contact me on
my email id personally.


PS: Those who want to get associated with ELPA, send me mail offline.
Thanks

         Well, time to get off the list, I guess. But really, to learn
GNU/Linux, FOSS etc, one need not understand the so called SMS lingo
and people need not assume that everyone understands sms lingo. I
didn't understand a good part of Pavithran's reply. So, if you post it
in SMS lingo, others are forced to learn that. Hope people understand.
Thanks

        I don't see why you have to do this(top-posting in this case).
If you are doing it to show that top-posting is bad, then there is
already a bunch of people doing it regularly. I thought these
etiquettes/guidelines were the natural way to post in a mailing list
and we don't have to 'force' ourselves to do it.

Again, there are a lot of people who support your point when you speak
against top-posting and other guidelines violation. So, its a really
bad if you violate the guidelines because others are violating it or
the list members are cursing you for trying to enforce the guidelines.

Pre-installed laptop will be good, I may consider buying. Right now in any preinstalled Linux system the distribution is decided by the vendor.
I wish you think about giving the customer the choice of distribution.

Did you read man page of eject?
>From the man page:
       -t   With this option the drive is given a CD-ROM tray close command.
Not all devices support this command.

       -T   With this option the drive is given a CD-ROM tray close command
if it's opened, and a CD-ROM tray eject  command  if  it's closed. Not all
devices support this command, because it uses the above CD-ROM tray close
command.

eject - to load the cd looks funny -  oxymoron perhaps 

 similar thing that  I know

agt-get remove   to remove debian packages

others may please share (offcourse things from FOSS world only)

Hi,

I had created a directory named cgi-bin insdie /var/www/ and I had kept
inside that folder a .html file and a .pl file which was called in html
action.But when i try to access the directory or files in that directory
using http://localhost/cgi-bin/ I am getting FORBIDDEN 403 error saying that
I don't have permissions to access cgi-bin directory. Googled for so much
time to find the answer but even after implementing script alias code in
httpd.conf file there is no use.

Even I have tried changing the owner permissions to root,nobody and www-data
but it didn't work a bit. Still the same forbidden error message is
displayed.

It would be great if anyone give an ideal solution to this problem. Thanks
in advance.

Below is my latest edited httpd.conf file

ServerName localhost

It was a joke post. It is evident from the following:

1) A person who flames other about sms lingo is writing in sms lingo
2) The talk is about how foss.in sucks, which is again a joke
3) Some other members reciprocate with funny stuff in similar lingo

Do you need a [JOKE] tag?

Then  the value for the argument 'vendor' should be changed accordingly.
Run the following command:
lsusb

It will show the values for your device similar to
         Bus 003 Device 003: ID 19d2:fff1 ONDA Communication S.p.A.
                                             ^^^^^^^^
which is for a ZTE modem.

This is quite difficult. for a startup to get labeling and other stuff. So I
am doing it for Desktop first.
NO, I will give choice of distribution to customer and all the distro
provide more or less same feature. The distro lacks some crucial feature
like usability(Ex rightclick in schoolos) , one-click(Ex RUNZ framework),
alternate compatible FSH (Ex GoboFS, MoonOS) etc. So my motive is to give
something which works well. So that Linux User can work on Linux without
LUG/IRC for getting help on "plz fix it". (ofcourse LUG/IRC needed for other
purpose)

PS: Think like MAC, a hardware and a software, which just work...
PS1: Also, the customer/market I am aiming is not LUG, i am aiming those who
do not know Linux atall, So I needed not sit for compatibility for all
Distro..

Is this some attempt to troll? You've been asking some pretty dumb
questions in the last 2 emails.
How would you input a command if the keyboard is disabled?

there have been many cases when I came across my keyboard not working and I
had to find solution with other laptop or external keyboard to surf internet
and etc....
so I was wondering if there is any command or such which can make it
enable/disable...
I know this sounds stupid but its not dumb...

I am not sure if this is the thing that you want to know, but let me
tell you how to add the DVDs to your repository.

Insert each disk one by one.
For each disk run the command 'sudo apt-cdrom add' in the terminal.
Alternatively using the Synaptic package manager, you can use Edit->
Add CDROM.

Hope this helps. :)

It doesn't work for me (Ubuntu 10.10). Anyways, I've noticed in some systems
(earlier versions of GNU/Linux) that pressing Ctrl+S in terminal stops
getting input from keyboard. Is this a bug?

Dear luggies,
                    In my friend's fedora 13 machine after installing any

Why do you want to do that?  Is it because you're already a PHP programmer?

Not a framework, but how about HTML5. Will work on every device that has a
(modern!) browser.

I would suggest that anyone starting a career in software development get
used to using HTML5. Most likely, that will be the only GUI technology that
will be in use in a few years!

But as far as I know browser itself is a desktop application not a web application.

I don't know many Linux users who are not geeks. And the non geeks want to
stick to Windows. But this is my opinion. I am sure you would have done some
research before starting the business.

All the very best. I wish you success. We need more people like you who want
to be on their own.

Out of my experience (in engineering line), I would also inform you of the
requirement of service people even before you start selling. People will be
willing to wait even for a day or two when they buy from a reputed brand,
but will want you 'yesterday' when they are dealing with a small/start up
company.

I did try Linux based systems for our machines (control and data acquisition
system) - They worked brilliantly even out performing Windows. BUT I had to
turn back to Windows the ONLY reason was service and support. It was very
easy for our clients in the North to get a local computer technician to sort
out issues in a Windows machine. The funny part was that even hardware
issues will not be addressed by the technician because Linux was installed
in it!

With regards,
Arun Venkataswamy.

Base64 is a group of similar encoding schemes that represent binary
data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64
representation. The Base64 term originates from a specific MIME
content transfer encoding.

If the intention is to write a browser, yes, do it in a platform dependent
way. But for most other applications do it in a platform independent way. It
does not hurt to have your application running on PCs, smartphones, tablets
etc.

Hi,

You have to download "download Slax for CD" from
http://www.slax.org/get_slax.php

I hope it is not possible or too weired to get the iso from the
bootable usb disk.
Downloading the iso for CD is the better way.

Subject: [Ilugc] queries: setting up svn access via apache/ssl
Message-ID: <458691.84716.qm@web33102.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to set up a svn with access via https.

System is some Ubuntu system. I have ssh/root access and am unfamiliar with Ubuntu servers. I have better experience with Redhat and hence you might have to tell me how to find out info.

I need to have a svn server which I can access as either:
a. https://svn.<myserver>.com
OR
b. https://<myserver>.com/svn

I am not apache expert nor svn expert but have very basic config knowledge in them but am reasonably good with Linux in general.

I am doing a lot of googling but will appreciate if anyone can help me out. Am also willing to look at short contract for setting up an 'industrial strength' server with full security.

Here is the: less /etc/debian_version
lenny/sid

Here is what I have done:
1. Created repo: 
sudo mkdir -p /storage/repos
sudo svnadmin create --fs-type fsfs /storage/repos

2. In apache:
sudo mv /etc/apache2/mods-available/dav* /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/
sudo mv /etc/apache2/mods-available/ssl.* /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/

admin@RedMine:~$ sudo apt-get install mod*svn*
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
E: Couldn't find package mod*svn*

And... I am stuck here. 

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
kc

Hi,

The required module for apace is not "modsvn"

It is libapache2-svn
Install this module.

Here is a great article that explains everything in detail.

As FDP is all about training faculties, I am looking for trainers who is

interested in doing FDP in colleges).

Message-ID: <AANLkTinBbzQjO3qM_MFdNZzG-K05cDN3AqV+MydiZSrt@mail.gmail.com>

I have this code in php to read the length of a string in utf-8,

<?php
 header("Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8");
 $a = "?????";
 $c = strlen(utf8_decode($a));
 echo "The string input: ".$a." and its length:".$c;
?>

But it returns out put as : The string input: ????? and its length:5
Now I want to have the out put as 3 but not as 5, how to achieve that?

Thanks & Regards

This is to do with Unicode Tamil. Not PHP. It's the same in every indic
language.
Tamil is stored in Unicode strings in it phonetic / grammatical form.
So, ????? is actually stored as Tha + (im + e) + (la + dot). That makes up
the 5 characters.

The only way to achieve what you want is to write a strlen function which
understands tamil grammar.

????? [sic] is made up of 5  Unicode code points.

Tamil Letter TA, Tamil Letter MA, Tamil Vowel Sign i, Tamil Letter LA, Tamil
Sign Virama.

So the output is technically correct.

You have to some logical manipulation, to count the syllables instead of
Unicode Code point.

You need to use multi byte string functions. Please refer to
http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.mbstring.php

Note the User contributed note by Ant P for enabling mbstring
functions in your existing code.

Hope this helps.

I assume that you have done updation from net when using earlier version.It is most likely that the update didn't detect your settings right. Try to reinstall boot loader from CD of your earlier version of ubuntu. If you have cd of current version, check if any option is there for reinstalling boot loader alone.

If you have live cd try mounting your disk partitions and post what is in /boot folder

You need to install the packages usb-modeswitch and usb-modeswitch-data and
then run the 'modprobe' command with appropriate options for your device, to
make the device to be recognised as modem, instead of mass storage.

Can't you learn something when you are told so politely? Will you stop all
these non-sense only when somebody shouts at you?

AFAIK you have received 3 mails from co-ordinator asking you to read the
rules. Did you read it? When you have no time to read and follow few simple
rules, how do you expect everybody else to "reply soon"? Go and read the
rules now! And stop doing stupid stuff.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=NSDQbS30pQ3=E2oh=_m5yBMJ2a3EUOUi-z-rS@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am having a strange problem with a program compiled with mingw/gcc under
windows environment. Please look at the following "C"  code snippet...

wordlist.txt contains UTF-8 Tamil text.

if ((fileHandle = _wfopen( L"wordlist.txt",L"rt,ccs=UTF-8")) != NULL)
{
    wchar_t c;
    for(a=0;a<5;a++)
    {
        c = fgetwc(fileHandle);
        printf("%04X %d\n",c,sizeof(wchar_t));
    }
}

It is working perfectly in Windows Vista. That is, it produces an output
like
0B85 2
0B83 2
0BB1 2
0BBF 2
0BA3 2


But in Windows XP, it produces an unexpected output like
00EF 2
00BB 2
00BF 2
00E0 2
00AE 2

What could be the problem? The first three values listed (in xp) are
actually UTF-8 markers.

In last ILUGC meet it was decided that a wiki page will be created for
requesting talks as majority of people felt that people are not comfortable
with mailing the list/coordinator for the same.

I have created the page [1] and added few topics suggested by the
participants of last meet. Please feel free to add topics of your interest
to the wiki page.

Also it was decided that the topics for meet will be announced early
enabling ILUGC members to schedule their time so that attendance in meet
could be improved. In this regard Raman suggested that confirmed topics be
intimated to the list as and when it occurs instead of waiting for all the
topics to be confirmed. So, if anybody is wiling to give talks for next
meet, please send mail to the coordinator or to the list.

Subject: [Ilugc] runtime linking without LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Message-ID: <icgpfh$8js$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hi,

here is my problem, downloaded latest glib-2.0 (2.26) tarball and did 
'./configure --prefix="/home/localuser/localbuilds/"; make; make install'.

At runtime, I need to use the latest libgio-2.0.so (because of 
GDBusProxy) which is inside my '/home/localuser/loacalbuilds/lib'. Is 
there any way to link to this latest library without using LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

One proper way is to create /etc/ld.so.conf.d/glib-2.26.conf file and 
add /home/localuser/localbuilds/lib to it, then executing 'sudo 
/sbin/ldconfig -v' will rebuild system wide /etc/ld.so.cache, but I 
don't have root permission to follow this method.

Also, there is no hint of a local ld.so.cache in ld-linux.so(8), 
ldconfig(8),ld(8) and ld.so.conf(5) man pages.

Is there any way to solve this? basically I'm not a root user and I 
don't want to mess my environment with LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Cheers,
Mohan R

Number of syllables is is not the number of characters excluding vowels.
For example ?????? has only 3 syllables not 4.
?, ??? , ??

????????? has ?,???,?,??,?? 
and 

Syllable is a pronunciation unit. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable

see syllabalize_ta method in https://github.com/santhoshtr/silpa/blob/master/src/silpa/modules/syllabalizer/syllabalizer.py
Or see online tool for this at http://silpa.smc.org.in/Syllabalize

Subject: [Ilugc] Unable to get wifi up with knetworkmanager
Message-ID: <AANLkTikCUoLCY2oKPBG6KzQZU36HUimbCRvfeyyhXBtW@mail.gmail.com>

Hardware: Acer 5542 ( Atheros WiFi, )
OS: Debian Squeeze kernel 2.6.32-5-amd64.
Desktop: KDE 4.4.5

WiFi and Ethernet drivers are loaded, /sbin/ifconfig shows all the
network devices properly.
knetworkmanager is visible in the systray.

The problem:

When I login in to the desktop; the knetworkmanager icon shows the
RJ45 connector instead of the WiFi indicator.

When I click on the icon, I can see the WiFi AP and respective signal
strengths.  My AP is configured as "WPA2 Personal" and I have also
added the WiFi MAC address of my laptop to it's filter list.

When I select the AP, I get the WPA2 Personal dialog box; I enter the
passphrase.   I also select "Show password" to see that the passphrase
that I am typing in is correct.  It is accepted but then nothing
happens - no connection. The systray icon continues to show the RJ45
image.

This is forcing me to use the wired ethernet connection and limiting
my ability to move around in the office.

Any idea what could be the problem?

TIA

actually there are two types of vowel - one that is a character in it's
own right and the other that is just an addition to a character. My code
counts the first type of vowel (which is at the beginning of a word),
but not the second type.

I am not counting syllables, I am counting characters in the

Dear all,

A engg. college in coimbatore is urgently looking for open source
alternative for MicroWind DSCH3.1 verilog compiler. PIC16F modeller (it
costs about 4L+ for 5 user license).

If anybody knows foss equivalent for the above, pl. let me know.

The college has decided to migrate  with open source alternatives in all the

Have you tried running "./configure --help", you should find options
where you can specify different include and library paths.

ELF format spec permits you to hard code library path in the binary
itself.  Should warn you that this practice is discouraged in favor of
runtime linking using ld, LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
are easier to manage.

If you want set this clock as default in your terminal,

Include this command in your .bashrc file


Ex:

[Student@mercury ~] $ vim .bashrc

# User specific aliases and functions

#Terminal clock
export PS1="${PS1%\\\$*}"' \t \$ '

Save this using Press "Esc" and type ":wq!"

Now, you can see the Clock every time when, you open your terminal

[Student@mercury ~] 12:43:34 $ echo "Default Clock Was Set"
Default Clock Was Set

You can try to use Icarus verilog (iverilog).

Thanks.  If the college accepts the above, is it possible to provide
training  for the faculties (then it's easy for us to convince all engg.
colleges in the coimbatore region).

Also, we are in the process of promoting FEL (Fedora Electronics Lab) in the
ECE departments.

What are the projects/exercises that the above mentioned are used for?
iverilog is NOT capable of doing quite a lot of stuff. I would like to
look at the lab assignments / projects targetted before suggesting an
alternative. What do you mean by a PIC16F modeler? Are you looking at
a PIC simulator?

Please elaborate.

Are you able to connect it otherwise, if you don't use KNetworkManager?

Then, we had a good conversation about the required talks on monthly meets.
We collected some topics from the audience and decided to list them in
http://wiki.ilugc.in


We discussed about mentoring college students to do their projects.
we can create a page in wiki for interesting projects to do and
we can get some students to accomplish the projects.

I have also tried to configure the WiFi with the "System Settings >
Network Connections"; same deal - I get prompted for the WPA2 pass
phrase and no result i.e. connection.

I have not looked into configuring with CLI tools as I have not done
it before - suggestions welcome.

With Ubuntu 10.04 Netbook edition on my HP mini, I am able to get WiFi
connection on this AP with the same WPA2 passphrase I am using in KDE.
 Ditto with Win XP on my brother's laptop.

We have made some changes. Users can now use the wiki without having to
worry much about captcha

1. Registered user can edit/create pages. Captcha won't show up .
2. If an edit adds external link(s) the user will be asked with captcha.
3. User has to enter captcha while registering an account.
4. Anonymous edits are banned.

Even after I did that, I had issues in some cases, especially if we use
WEP128 Hex. The problem was solved by switching to wicd. As I understand it,
the issue is largely with the supplicant.

Yeah,  at first I did not have the cat 5 cable plugged in and yet the
knetworkmanager preferred to show the RJ45 icon in systray.  I click
on the icon and see that my WiFi AP is indeed visible to the laptop.
I select the WiFi AP and get prompted for the WPA2 passphrase.  I
enter it, then it says trying to establish connection and then nothing
happens.   Nothing in /var/log/messages either.  After quite a few
unsuccessful attempts, I decided to make a wired connection and move
on.   The funny thing is, it worked when I used to invoke
knetworkmanager manually from the KMenu.   Then I configured it
knetworkmanager to be in the systray after which I am unable to
establish WiFi connection.

Very unlikely, Google wouldn't be paying individuals, although they do
pay Mozilla to keep Google as the default search engine:
http://techcrunch.com/2008/08/28/mozilla-extends-lucrative-deal-with-google-for-3-years/

OTOH, Ubuntu is paid by Yahoo, to switch the search engine in Firefox.
 Yahoo had also signed a deal with Bing (from Microsoft) so that move
didn't make too many fanboys happy.

HTH.

Hi

The last few days I have been facing at random this peculiar problem
when I power on the pc it does not show me wifi connections but just the
wireless broadband when I click the broadband it does not connect just
says connecting. On careful observation I found that when I was not
prompted for login password this happens after a few restart attempts it
prompts for my password and I get the wifi but not the broadband. Any
one had this problem,  I read a some what similer problem Mr. Arun Khan
is facing are they related as am also using ubuntu 10.04 lucid how ever
two other xp systems have no problem finding and connecting to the
wifi. 

Any pointers ?  On doing a duck duck go.. I found some interesting
article here is goes.

Hi

The last few days I have been facing at random this peculiar problem
when I power on the pc it does not show me wifi connections but just the
wireless broadband when I click the broadband it does not connect just
says connecting. On careful observation I found that when I was not
prompted for login password this happens after a few restart attempts it
prompts for my password and I get the wifi but not the broadband. Any
one had this problem,  I read a some what similer problem Mr. Arun Khan
is facing are they related as am also using ubuntu 10.04 lucid how ever
two other xp systems have no problem finding and connecting to the
wifi. 

Any pointers ?  On doing a duck duck go.. I found some interesting
article here is goes.

if you have console access to the server , please check the mysqld.err file.
That will provide more information on why mysqld didn't start.

This is a community mailing list dedicated to FOSS. Do not use this as a
venue to advertise your site. Your last post too had no connection with
FOSS. Entrepreneurship != FOSS, unless the startup is built on those
technologies and principles.

The content stored in file/array are character encoding values and the
actual characters or images (glyphs) showed on the screen are
completely differ (in value and count) from that codes.  Because,
glyphs are shown after rendering encoded values by rendering engines
(like Pango). Please check the pango lib[1], it may provide some
useful function for this.

The developers of IE8 might be in a better position to answer your question.

AFAIK, IE8 is a closed/proprietary application and this list is
related to Linux and other FOSS apps.
Suggest you join relevant MS development forums and pose your question there.

Hi,

I have started a new website for technical articles sharing.

http://www.yourwiz.com

we will learn many things and we will forgot it later.
this website will allow us to wrtie article on what we learn or on any
technology.
in future it will be useful for us as well as others.

cause: because microsoft is trying to enforce it's own standards of what
css and js should do

solution: one solution was already suggested. another one: put up a
notice on the site saying: 'users of IE8 are requested to upgrade to a

The hub?  I suspect 192.168.1.1 is the broadband modem. Usually bb
modem's have two interfaces - public and local.
 curl ifconfig.me/ip -> will show you the public Ip address of the modem

> and my box has the ip 192.168.1.2 - and the windows machines get

Yes, possible. Are the machines configured for static or dynamic IP address?
 Usually Broadband Modem/Routers  run DHCP service these days.

Why not open 192.168.1.1 in the browser? It's probably the modem.
If you have the credentials, login and see the configuration.

Please define access?

If you want to access the files on linux, you can install samba on the
linux box and the shared folders will be visible in the windows
network.

If you want to access via ssh, install ssh server on linux box and ssh
client like putty on windows box.

Nothing is stopping you from rewiring it the right way.   To enforce any form
of network security or access control for WinXP machines, you need physical
isolation between the modem and the WinXP machines.  Connect the modem
to eth0 and the hub* to eth1 of your Linux server.  This ensures that the only
physical path out to the internet is through your Linux server.


If you are running NAT on the modem, then do not NAT, only route traffic
on your Linux server. Do not do double NAT -- once on Linux server, and
once on DSL modem.  Let the DSL modem alone do NAT.


Create the networks as follows:

modem LAN -- 192.168.1.1/24
Linux WAN (eth0) -- 192.168.1.2/24, default gateway set to 192.168.1.1
Linux LAN (eth1) -- 192.168.2.1/24
WinXP clients -- 192.168.2.x with default gateway set to 192.168.2.1

Set a static route on your DSL modem for 192.168.2.x/24 subnet through
192.168.1.2 as gateway.

Ensure your WinXP clients can ping 192.168.1.1 (modem) as well as
internet IPs.

It's bad practice to have 2 router in a single subnet which are gateways
for each other.  Eg. Win XP machines will use 192.168.1.2 (linux) as
default gateway to internet.  Linux uses 192.168.1.1 (modem) as default
gateway. Return packets from modem should ideally use the same path
back to WinXP machines through the Linux server.  But your in network
the WinXP machines and modem are in the same subnet and directly
reachable.  Your Linux machine will never see return packets from the
modem back to WinXP clients.  You end up with asymmetric routing,
and that's something  you should do only if you know exactly what you
are doing.


* the word "hub" really gives away your IT legacy :-)  Even the cheapest
network devices today are switches, and hubs belong to a bygone era.

PyS60 is used for quick prototyping and it is good (as far as I know.) .
Before two years I have seen some demo with PyS60 and Nokia phone at
Trivandrum. They demonstrated how to controll reobots (Small robots builts
with FOSS hardware) with PyS60

Android has a scripting layer too. It supports Python programming. You can
try it in the Android Simulator .

	Documentation
Message-ID: <AANLkTikxxTX1rZPzicXdMVcjBJz+OaW-dd0uTysof=PJ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Redhat in their documentation on gfs vs nfs have provided some limitations
of NFS with illustrated diagrams as can be seen in the below link. My
question is..

They have shown GFS servers over iScsi servers and mentioned the benefits of
single file-system over the multiple block device paths thereby providing
redundancy. However cant the same be achieved with NFS by placing nfs over
the multiple iscsi servers and still you would get the same results.

I mean when GFS clients access the GFS servers it will be same as NFS
clients accessing NFS servers. Please clarify.

On the NFS servers, how will you mount the shared iSCSI volume?
Which FS will you use to format the iSCSI volume?  Ext3/etc are not
cluster aware, ie, you cannot mount the same block device from
multiple servers at the same time.

NFS is not a true file system -- it's only the means of exporting a
backend FS on to the network.  Unless you have a cluster aware
FS on the backend which is shared across multiple servers, you
will end up with independent storage islands for each NFS server.

It is also not best practice to take a backend cluster FS and re-export
it using NFS/CIFS.  This typically breaks Unix file locking semantics.
Best option is to use cluster aware file systems like GFS, Luster,
Coda, StorNext (proprietary) end to end.


NFS has addressed this lack of parallelism in version 4.1 -- see pNFS.
pNFS provides multiple data paths for the block access to increase
performance, while meta data is on a single server as before.  You still
need a shared backend storage and FS anyway.

In my opinion it's not worth spending any time on Symbian, let
alone PyS60.

Symbian Foundation is on the decline, it has lost several supporters
recently.  Apple iOS, and Google Android have the most mind share
in the smart phone world.  Better you target these platforms.

If you want something newer, try Windows Phone 7 ;-)


> Will Python be useful for android or iphone development?

Apple AppStore accepts apps which are written using Objective-C
and official SDK only.  There were some startups which tried to
create a common programming environment for all major smart
phone platforms but failed to get traction due to Apple's draconian
policy of not allowing other dev tools on the AppStore.

In addition to Java/Dalvik, Android supports several scripting
languages, see http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/

In my opinion, it's best to go with the native tool chain for smart
phone development or use HTML5/JS if applicable.

There is an excellent solution :

Use the JavaScript to detect the browser string.
create a if/else loop like

If (browser == IE)
then
    just display one line on website - Please download Firefox which is much
better then IE browser. This site is not made for IE. give a url to download
Firefox browser.
else
 all your code
done

Also, you might want to check out Many Eyes. You can upload datasets or use
any
of the existing uploaded datasets and 'see' the data from many of the

Friends.

Most of us will be getting requests from college students for the
topics and mentor-ship for their projects.

For any student, to do some project in the open source world, he/she
needs to learn some basic things like

Linux Installation
Connecting with internet
Joining Mailing lists
Creating filters for mailing lists
Mailing list guidelines
IRC tools and Joining in Channels
Choosing a suitable Project
Learning the language like c,c++,Python,Perl,Ruby,LAMP,Web,Java technologies
Revision Control Systems like svn, git
Documenting the code

and more.

Though they can learn by themself, if we mentor them in the initial
stages of the FOSS contributions,
Their progress will be quicker and they will get more interest to contribute.

Please add your details here.
http://wiki.ilugc.in/index.php?title=Projects_Mentors

We can help students from get in the project and till they start
discussing with main stream project developers.

we can mentor them by online media like mail,chat,irc etc.

We can share this link to the college students so that they can choose
their mentors and start contributing.

Share your thoughts.

Thanks.

The same should work with class objects too. I've used it many times and
still using. If the class object variable is not pointer just try
(gdb) p class_object_variable

if it is pointer try
(gdb) p *class_object_variable

You are asking on the wrong list. Try some web designers mailing list.
Since people here are assumed to be on Linux, they cannot even be able
to see the problem as IE 8 doesn't install on Linux natively.

Depends on how you define 'worth'. Python is not a popular development language 
for mobile phones. On symbian, PyS60 is pretty useful and allows access to most 
of the OS features. This makes it a good choice for symbian. However, the API is 
symbian specific and not transferable to other mobile/desktop OS. So, if you 
just want to create symbian apps, PyS60 is a good choice (at least to to start 
off with).

The recent Indian PyCon in bangalore had a very good talk on the introduction to 
PyS60 by N. Seshadri[1]. Check the demo code and slides if you are interested.

> Will the learning be useful in the advance nokia moble platforms like meago?

Not directly, Meego is a completely different platform and designed quite 
differently from symbian. It not compatible with the Symbian API. However if you 
are new to mobile development, it might indirectly be useful as a means to learn 
from similarities and differences.

Although I've heard android has a scripting layer, I've also heard that python 
on that is fairly unusable on it beyond the hello world type scripts (in terms 
of speed). I have no clue about iphone.

+1. I've been messing around with Android for the past one year, and 
it's been a rewarding experience. It's so good to see Android phones 
popping up in friends/acquaintances hands and they declare "dude, I got 
an Android phone!". Most of them, even non-techies have a fair bit of 
idea that it's an "open source mobile OS from Google" (let's face it, 
Google's brand name did feature in that buying decision too).

The phones are getting cheaper every 3 months or so, and you can do a 
fair bit of Android programming without owning one, actually - it has 
really good emulators (which you can try different screen sizes/aspect 
ratios resolutions). I'm sure you saw Samsung Galaxy Tab ads in the TV 
networks, so it's only going to get better.

There are some criticisms of Android of course - that it's not "true 
foss" - the reason being Google not doing the framework development in 
the open, and it does a "code drop" with every release. (Read this for 
context: 
http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/06/froyo-code-drop.html). 
But Google afaik claims they need that time to negotiate features and 
technology issues with various partners in the OHA 
(http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/). On which I'm willing to give 
Google a pass, because the framework and the tool chain is so awesome. 
Also because despite of existence of frameworks like OpenMoko (and the 
more recent Meego/Moblin), Google has been the only company that had 
enough momentum (money and open source chops) to bring a foss 
alternative to mass-produced phones.

Not to mention the really great modding community out there - I have a 
fairly old phone, the G1/ADP1 which in Android terms is almost over the 
hill (HTC stopped releasing official updates after 1.6). But thanks to 
Cyanogen (http://www.cyanogenmod.com/) I run the latest Froyo (2.2). Of 
course, there's also the veritable XDA-Developers who keep doing awesome 
work in this front. So I suggest you give Android a shot - even if you 
don't have a phone - and you just might end up liking it. As for Python, 
there's ASE (http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/) if you give 
that a read, you'll see that it indeed has great support on Android.

Vamsee.

P.S: Sorry if I sounded like a Google fanboy - Android is one of the 
reasons I still like the company - I've been pretty impressed with their 
work so far. I've been tempted to try iOS toolset, but I really don't 
like Apple's attitude towards 3rd party developers. And as for 
Intel/Nokia's meego, it's an interesting OS for sure, but almost no 
momentum when it comes to community (or variety of devices for that matter).

I was assuming creating a LVM device out of multiple exported raw iscsi
volumes and then formatting them with ext3/4 and then exporting them. But I
get the point as to why use gfs.

However, now I am confused about using separate iSCSI servers. What I was
aware of was... that the san exporting raw device over IP would be an iSCSI
export else an FC export in case it uses the FC fabric.

i.e. Those devices can then be discovered on a Linux/Any server and then
formatted with a files-system.

1. Why are there 2 iscsi "servers"?? What is their role.
2. Do they first discover raw device from FC SAN and then export them as
iSCSI devices?
3. Are the iSCSI devices discovered on multiple GFS servers and then
formatted?

Lots of question popping up.. I need to do homework.. Will ask when am more
clear on some concepts...

A very good initiative, but I think it needs to be done in a lot more 
organized manner than just listing contacts on a wiki. Perhaps, 
something like GSoC but with a more general approach. While I have 
always been keen to interact with college students, the kind of 
interaction is almost always "please spoon feed me". I send them almost 
step by step instructions to how to "ask smart questions" and do their 
homework, and most of them will never get back.

Perhaps we should turn it around - since most of us have jobs and our 
time is limited, we can list what platforms/technologies we are willing 
to help with, and ask them to submit ideas - give them ample resources 
to read up and what to ask and how to ask.

  Say if there are 3 people interested in mentoring in Python, we allow 
the students to submit as many proposals as possible (maybe giving 
advice on how to fine-tune it) and pair *1 student with 1 
volunteer/mentor*. So out of maybe 10 project ideas presented, only 3 
will be selected. This puts the onus on students with come up with a 
good idea, and makes them compete for experts' time/attention.

I think this gives the maximum attention to a deserving student, while 
also giving value to the mentor's time.

In project list page i am looking at couple of external links. For example,

Congratulations on getting the N900 ! It really is a nice phone with a cool 
platform.

Now that said, I'm really sorry to be the person to bring you some bad news -- 
Although MeeGo is supposed to be the successor for Maemo, it is a /totally/ 
different platform. MeeGo is a ground up redesign of the best ideas of Maemo and 
Mobilin. As such, Maemo is not 'upgradable' to MeeGo. Worse still, the N900 will 
never see an official Meego release from Nokia (or rather the Meego project, 
which is part of the Linux Foundation). The good news though is there is a 
community effort to port Meego to the N900[1].

disclaimer: Biased opinions follow.

> though,
> i don't find a lot many developers on this platform..

Then you haven't really looked at the right place :). Maemo has been around 
since 2005 (since Nokia's 770 Internet tablet) and has a very large developer 
community. The main place for finding information, applications and developers 
for maemo is at:

http://maemo.org/

I would rather recommend switching to Meego instead. Considering the fact that 
there is no corporate push behind Maemo anymore (which is, IMHO, fairly 
important in the handheld device market -- but then again, I could be proved 
wrong in the years to come).

> MeeGo which is the next supposed version of Maemo comes from the world's two

As of right now tho', working on Meego is a bit painful (as compared to Android) 
given the fact that there isn't any clear roadmap or even a real world reference 
design for Meego. Nokia & Intel are being extremely lethargic in getting Meego 
ready for prime time (especially at a time when Android seems to be sweeping its 
way through the market to become the platform of choice).

IMHO, Meego is much more cleaner and 'open' than Android but might not make it 
simply because it is slow to move.

Either is going to give you just about the same performance.    Live
images are typically much much faster however, especially when you use a
USB stick for installation.

Perl 6 is a entirely different language and will have to grow its own
ecosystem and might end up casting more doubts on the future of the
language.  Having said that, you don't have to wait,

$ yum search perl6  (Fedora 14)

Apple's really got draconian policies...

Yes. The only way to get your app into the app store is by first getting a
developer license by signing up for their developer program (USD 100). And
signing up is no easy process. You need to actually 'fax' (they don't accept
scanned copies by email) the application form, your tax certificates and
stuff to them to Cupertino! Then there is this wait for the telephone call
through which an interview is made. Then you get the license. The most
amazing thing is that, you require a provisioning profile (a digital
certificate) from them to download your own app into your own phone for
testing. Mind you, this profile is valid only for 4 months. You need to keep
updating it every 4 months. Once you test your app yourself, you submit it
to Apple for testing. This might take up to 2-3 weeks. They comeback with
their test results and recommendations which are mostly arbitrary. Once my
app (iPad) was rejected saying that the app was too similar to the iPhone
version of my app and hence I should just modify the iPhone version of the
app to work with the iPad. After they accept your app, it goes into the
store for sale.

Despite all this, there are hundreds of thousands of apps in the store. Each
and every developer wanting to hit the million download jackpot.

Development can only be done with the official SDK and in Objective C (and
in an Apple machine). Despite all the control they hold over you and how an
app is developed, I have to give it to them on the quality of the tools they
provide. Top class and extra ordinary. XCode is one of the best IDEs I have
worked with. These guys are arrogant, but their arrogance comes out of the
fact that they are really good. One company which can be highly
artistic/technical/business minded. Strange combination.

BTW the iPhone OS (iOS) is based on BSD. XCode uses a modified verion of
GCC.

Though there isn't any official support from nokia for maemo to meego
upgrade, there is an appreciable support from meego community and already
the MeeGo v1.0 for n900 and netbooks are out..

As you say,there is no corporate push behind maemo or there is never going
to be any too.. I hear of some gossips saying that nokia is supposedly to
draw its support for maemo after it releases n9 with meego on it.

When it becomes true, MeeGo shud be the real go.

IMHO,the real drive behind android against any of its competitors is the
name google first of all and its better interface than others. I hope this
is infact achieved at Meego. But there is still not a welcome for Nokia's
stand against Andriod which may yet more make meego slow to pick up.

All of these still may surely be faked,if MeeGo meets 'our' needs.

At this movement, Meego sucks!!!

I accept that libsocialweb and all other charms going upstream, but I'm 
really struggling to get the SDK up in my Debian (x86_64 - Testing). 
Everything is heavily monopolized towards Qt and "AMD64?? mi**le f**ger 
is for you!!" is an unofficial statement. I don't know how it suppose to 
be "An auspicious project of Linux Foundation" without a generic SDK.

When I was looking these mobile OSes, maemo looks great. N900 created a 
huge craze last year, but nokia f**ked-up everything..

If somebody is developing for meego and have a spare intel machine, let 
me know.

be taking back the development of the OS.

In 2008 the company decided that it would open the OS up to developers,
allowing anyone to work with the underlying code "for any purpose". The idea
was to bring a wealth of new developers to the Symbian platform who would
then contribute to the development of the system, and more applications to
run on it.

But Since they didnt get any good response from developers side they are
taking it back.

is this possible in open source side?????

Friends.

Barcamp is happening at chennai on coming saturday.

What is Barcamp?
BarCamp is an unconference born from the desire for people to share
and learn in an open environment.
It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from attendees.

BarCamp is an open, welcoming, once-a-year anytime-in-a-year event for
geeks to camp out for a couple days
with wifi and smash their brains together. It?s about love and geekery
and having a focal point for great ideas, like FOOcamp but open.

The event will be free. But there's a catch! Partipants are expected
to contribute back to the conference
by participating actively. "Active participation" might mean giving a
presentation, helping with a presentation,
blogging or podcasting the event, or whatever other creative ways to
contribute people can come up with.


Date ? December 4th, 2010
Venue ? PayPal Office,No 334 Futura IT Park, OMR
Sholinganallur, Chennai ? 600119
Tickets cost ? Free

For More Details,
http://barcampchennai.org/index.php?title=Main_Page


These kind of events are best places to talk about FOSS.
Let us speak about the various topics we are passionate about.

Why spam? If any person that I interview says he read the Refactoring 
book, his employability increases by at least 25%. If he actually 
identifies code smells and removes them from some example code, make 
that +80%. I'd encourage anybody who really cares about software 
development (agile or not) to attend the talk, or at least read the book.

Any idea about the time? I have a late train to catch that day :(

Reading through the suggestions, an idea that popped up was to deploy
FSOC (Four Seasons of Code) [1] and register people as
mentors/students. For a sample deployment one can check out the dgplug
website [2].

Dear Gentleman and good ladies,

It is true that most of resource people will be getting requests from
college students for the topics and mentor-ship for their projects. It is
also necessary for the students to learn few basic things (as listed in
previous mail) before starting projects.

The problem for us is to know where and how to start with. And it is
impossible for the mentors to spoon feed every student and teach everything.

So, I suggest the mentors, to start a blog for themself (for mentorship), to
list out the link urls, useful books and other resources in internet about
the technology, which help the students to self start. And after having some
basic knowledge, the students can do small codings and then personally
contact the mentors.

Suppose, if there are 4 mentors, good in Drupal, they can list the links
suggesting the students to learn prior doing a project with drupal. So the
students can go through the posts of 4 mentors, finds the best which fits
his/her need.

And if the mentors find little more time, they can write posts in their own
language so that the whole student community will be grateful to you.
So, the mentor list will be more useful if it is like,
NAME - EMAIL ID - BLOG ADDRESS - TECHNOLOGY

I personaly give the above opinion as I have spent a lots of time in
searching resources (and couldnt find any resource that starts from basics).
Anyhow there are a lot of experienced professionals and mentors who have
better options and opinions which might be better than that of mine. So,
continue discussing.

Regards,
K.Prawin

Its a lot easier to know where to start if you are working on a project 
meant to 'scratch your own itch'.
Take a look at gnusim8085 for instance. Some student found that no 
graphical 8085 simulators existed for Linux, rolled out his own.

Projects which start like this tend to become awesomer over time. Find 
your 'itch' and 'scratch' it. If you are stuck you can always seek 
guidance from the mentors; but only IF you had attempted to use a search 
engine to get answers first (Speaking from experience).

Dude, I don't mean to sound nasty, but let's get this straight, you mean 
you're not even willing to do something as simple as "dear classmates, 
what are you interested in, and what do you need?" and post it online? 
So we have to guess what you might need to get started with and put it 
all up? Who's doing the asking here, exactly?

How exactly do we know how much you can find online through simple 
googling, and where exactly do we have to step in to help you? Suppose, 
I know Ruby/Rails. So how do I know if people are even interested in 
knowing more? And which part of it?

Sorry for getting ranty, but this attitude is what pisses me off. I've 
been a student before, when there aren't even (local) forums like these 
to ask and learn. You're saying you can't even edit a wiki and *ask what 
you need* in a structured way. So what is it that you couldn't find info 
about? Ask it now, and you'll see how you'll get the answers. Go ahead. 
And FYI, something woozy like "whole student community will be grateful 
to you" is nonsense. I would be happier if I know just one good student 
benefited in a measurable way from my time spent. If you want help, do 
your homework, and then come to us.

spam because Martin Fowler is from ThoughtWorks, this is a
ThoughtWorks conducted event and I'm from ThoughtWorks (managed to say
the company name 3 times - yay!)

And I agree to your point - any self-respecting developer should read
