Ramkumar,

	The above line certainly needs a lot of attention.

	Do you mean to say that you have contributed to zsh development?

	That is marvellous!

	Anyway thanks for opening my eyes and the nice exposition.

	I am constantly amazed by Indian genius.

	Especially since our environment is so retrograde.

	It is no joke to have excellence in a developing economy.

	But my favourite window manager WindowMaker was written by a Brazilian so that disproves my theory. :-)

	Anyway thanks Ramkumar. Ever grateful to you...

	I promise I shall learn zsh as soon as I can manage.

	Then I will bug you of course. :-)
	
regards,
Girish

There is a tool called Gyach. I wasn't able to get it working because,
Gyach doesn't support ALSA. You need eSound. I don't have the patience
to get a wrapper for it(if at all it exists). So I discarded the idea.

> Or which tool both of the chatters

As of now, I use aMSN (http://amsn.sf.net) for Video ( 2x half duplex)
and I use Skype/Jamin for Voice.

And yes, I have tried to use GnomeMeeting from my home to connect to a
WinXP-> M$ Net Meeting, and was quite successful with Voice and Video,
but no text chat. The advantage is that you can see how much of band
width is in use. The flip side was that the Video and Voice quality
was very pathetic over my internet connection. Gnome Meeting/Net
meeting uses the regular GSM compression algorithms for voice
compression. It is no where near the voice quality of Skype. But if
you have a very good bandwidth every tool is the same.


HTH.

I think Gyach! does support WebCam

Their mission statement:

Stepwise instructions - to view Unicode Tamil text

1. You need to have Unicode Tamil fonts installed on your computer and 
the Operating System capable of rendering Tamil Scripts. Windows XP 
comes with a Unicode Tamil Font (Latha) and you need not 
download/install a unicode font.
2. In the Control Panel, in Regional/Languages Options you will need to 
ensure that Indic/Asian Language option is checked.
3. Use a browser that is capable of handling UTF-8 based pages (Netscape 
6, Internet Explorer 5) with the Unicode Tamil font chosen as the 
default font for the UTF-8 char-set/encoding view. Unicode Tamil Fonts 
may be downloaded from here. <http://www.tamilnation.org/fonts/latha.ttf>

Gnome Meeting has been renamed to Ekiga. So... Yes, I have tried :-).
But quality wise, I prefer half duplex mode in aMSN.

Hello All,

Greetings from the LINUX For You magazine team!

As you all know, we run a section called 'Opinions' in LFY where we
pose a question to the community and industry and publish the top five
responses (selected by our technical editors) in the magazine. Thanks
to all those who responded to the last month's question. The best
among the responses received have been published in the November 2006
issue of LFY.

The forthcoming issue of LFY would carry a story on LUGs. The article
would focus on what constitutes a perfect LUG. We want to pick up the
best practices that every LUG should carry out to evolve into an ideal
and perfect LUG. This would not just ensure scope for improvement for
the LUGs by getting a direct feedback from the community itself, but
would also help others to understand the value of LUGs better.

We value your suggestions and comments. So, any idea you would like to
share with us is most welcome.
Please write to us at sujata.banerjee@efyindia.com 
<mailto:sujata.banerjee%40efyindia.com> with a CC to
atul@efyindia.com <mailto:atul%40efyindia.com>, before 10th November,2006.

The top five responses will be published in the December 2006 issue of
LINUX for You.

Look forward to your responses.

I am talking theory so I am bound to be mistaken. :-)

CMIIW

<Begin textbook theory>

Even the worst ever vocodec G.711 needs not more than 64 kilo bits per second.

And I am guessing that every single broadband user has at least that much uplink speed available.

This explains quite well whey even dialup users get good performance with VoIP.

G.711 is very good of course and if you CELP(Code Excited Linear Prediction) then you could even make do with just 8 kilobits per second but the voice quality may not be great of course.

I have no idea what codec is used by Skype. I know for sure they also encrypt and compress, so I am guessing it is something proprietary based on one of the various codecs out there. Perhaps some speex hacker can help?

<End of textbook theory>

Now, how do you explain your problem?

Does M$ do something stupid as usual to goof things up? :-)

Hi,

	I have converted the OpenBSD style(9) man page for you with the
	command.

	$groff -Tps -mandoc /usr/src/man/man9/style.9 | ps2pdf14 style.pdf


	and uploaded it to 

	http://girish1729.googlepages.com/style.pdf

	I have often found proprietary C code to be really ugly and badly indented, formatted with all sorts of funny variable naming conventions.

	And people get so pedantic about useless topics like beginning every function with a Capital letter and using huge function names.

	Really it is not important beyond a point.

	C is an extremely expressive beautiful language almost like the grammar of Panini.

	So write beautiful code. Writing readable and maintainable code is much more important than proper commenting.

	Anyway read it and digest it. And internalize it and start using these techniques right away.

	Don't waste time discussing K & R style, some other style etc...

	Give it the importance this topic deserves and move on.

	No time to waste beating these topics to death.

	Cosmetics don't have value if you overdo it...

	My idea is not to start a vim emacs war.

	I use gg=G to indent and :se cindent and :sy on and :se nu in vim.

	All the best!

Good.  It will be really helpful for many.

But, the roman encoding used is also something that not everyone
knows.  For example, not many knows that "w" stands for the Tamil
letter "tha",  "nY" stands for the dravidian "na" , etc.  Only people
in AU-KBC and related places like UoH, IITK, IIIT, etc. will know.
So, it will be a good idea to give a table of that encoding also.  It
will be really helpful.

But it will be even more useful for some college students somewhere
who has taken up some NLP project.

Again, Taml linguists don't need to know the IIT-Kanpur encoding.  The
coding was designed NOT for Tamil, but as something that can be used
for all Indian languages.

hi,

my debian server has one IP and the /etc/network/interfaces is like  
this:

<snip>


# Loopback device:

# device: eth0
auto eth0

85.10.199.193 eth0

I have now been allotted 5 additional ips which are to be configured  
as virtual ethernet interaces. The help file they have given me reads  
like this:

<snip>

In their mail allotting the ips they have given this:

<snip>

additional IP-Adressen:
88.198.154.218 bis 88.198.154.222

</snip>

it will be noted that the 'subnet' of the additional 5 ips is  
different  from the main IP of my machine. So what do i do with the  
line in the original file that reads like this:

# default route to access subnet:
up route add -net 85.10.199.192 netmask 255.255.255.224 gw  
85.10.199.193 eth0

what do i change it to?

Hello,

I have installed Ubuntu 6.06 in HCl pc. P IV 2.66GHz, 512 MB RAM.
I was able to install java, tomcat,mysql and configured without any problem
I tried to install Eclipse "JBOssIDE-1.5.1.GA-Bundle-linux-gtk.tar.gz" and
extracted it.
This is working fine in RHWS 3. When i click the startup.jar file it opens
as a directory in Ubuntu.
How to start  it?  Is there any other version of Eclipse(full version like
the above) available for Ubuntu?

Thanks

Hi Raju,

I thought eclipse in linux had a linked executable. there will be a
eclipse file that can be executed from the shell. If you had java
installed and path set correctly, eclipse should start from this
executable.

I hope that answered it.

If you can, then check out the CD given with LFY a couple of months 
back. It has Eclipse latest version in it. You just need to unzip the 
contents and there is nothing to install/configure as such. Just a click 
away!
Or else, you can try the Ubuntu repos, with apt-get. You can get/instal 
Eclipse as well as CDT and other plugins using apt-get itself.

HTH :)

I strongly recommend the book - "The Practice of Programming" 
by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike [ISBN: 981-235-904-4]
to all brave souls who call themselves a 'computer programmer'.
If you are a programmer, this book (according to me) should be
the second book that you should own, and read from cover to 
cover - its concise and easy and grasp.

For Perl mongers, "Perl Best Practices" by Damian Conway 
[ISBN: 81-7366-828-0] is a must-read/must-have.

As a freelance programmer before, I've been a victim of code
like:
      int sachin = 0; // sachin equals 0.
and the most horrendous like the one below:
     $rhtdm = mysql_connect(....); 
where $rhtdm according to the author meant -  "Rehna Hai 
Tere Dil Mein" !

It is essential for every programmer to treat his program/script 
as a poem and give enough importance to its readability, 
maintainability, presentability and elegance than merely getting 
it to work.

With the Fedora team, as usual, pushing the release date of FC6 again 
and again (before finally releasing it on 24th and it getting available 
for download on 25th), we were left with no option but to go for the 
next most requested distro on the bulletinn board - Mandriva Linux 2007. 
This distro is a treat for users who like to work on multi-architecture 
platforms (32-bit and 64-bit).

Coming to the editorial highlights, we have a mega interview with Javed 
Tapia, founder Red Hat India, who speaks to the media for the first time 
after stepping down from his position of director - India. In the trends 
section, this month we discuss about the use of Linux in tghe 
supercomputing world.

We have two very interesting case studies this month, one that discusses 
the first mover advantage taken by Samsung by incorporating the 
'Linux-compatible' logo in their printer advertisement and the other 
about Bombay high court adopting Linux/OSS.

In our opinions section, this month, the community opines on how whether 
IPR is a boon or a bane. Also, in the 'Down Memory Lane' series, we look 
at the history of the KDE project.

Message-ID: <a0c4f6270611010411t67287647jf9bce7c126fad168@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ILUGC,

One of my friends has the Intex (cheap) LAN card Silan sc92031. Now,
that doesn't work at all in most distributions. However, the CD
provided with it ahs Linux drivers, albeit for kernels 2.4/2.5.

Now, an ILUGC member (Mr.Kumaraguru) has modified this for working
with kernel 2.6, and it is at
http://gurukumara.googlepages.com/

However, it doesn't compile under newer 2.6 kernels because of the
deprecation of some functions/macros used. In particular, MODULE_PARM
and a function called synchonize_irq.

I read up a bit and made some minimal changes which made the driver
compile under kernel 2.6.17:

http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~ee03b091/sc92031.c

It compiles, loads and works fine for about five minutes, following which I get:

kernel: [some numbers]: Disabled IRQ #201 (or something similar).

Despite my best attempts and googling, I could not solve this problem.
I'd appreciate it if someone could point it out and suggest the right
modification in the driver, as it will be useful to many.

Thanks.

Kumar

P.S. Right now, my friend is still enjoying internet, as his card
(with WinXP drivers) is recognized as a Wireless LAN card by
ndiswrapper, and as wlan0, works like a charm!

Kenneth,

 If I were you I would replace the line to read
 up route add -net 85.10.199.192 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 85.10.199.193 eth0

 Or your line itself should work.

 Remember though going by the book you should set the subnet mask to the exact value, due to VLSM and other funny things, such hacks actually work.

 Now, this is of course not the right way to do things.

 No guarantees.

This is way off topic.

Quite frankly I heard about Panini again in a NetBSD mailing list few days ago in relation with some not very technical discussion.

Of course NetBSD folks are not humans... they are machines only talking some OS theory,algo or some such thing that never enters my brain...

But Panini struck me as odd.

Now that Roshan sent a mail I searched for Panini again and got to know that the modern Augmented Backur Naur Form (ABNF) was actually derived from Panini's grammer.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini

The article evens claims that Noam Chomsky derived his grammer from Panini and that Panini is the father of modern computing in a way. Read it.

What to talk of ancient Indian genius?

Even Shrodinger is supposed to owe his uncertainty theory and quantum mechanics to Upanishads and the Vedas.

Talking of linguistics, I am not exactly a linguist though I am a polyglot.

And of late I have been thinking of this.

That English really falls short when I want to express something, especially certain philosophical concepts or especially idioms.

(For examples please contact me off list, I have at least five)

I find that languages like Tamil have nearly everything I want though you have to resort to English or Sanskit at times...

In particular I love these Tamil idiomatic phrases.

(Non Tamilians please excuse)

	a) Veraluketha veekam ( Swelling proportional to finger)
	b) Kaaka ukkanthuthan panankai vizunthathan(crow sits and palm falls)
	c) Uuran vetu neiyan pondati kaiyan( wife is generous with someone's ghee)
	d) Aarina kanji pazhan kanji (cooled barley water is old stuff)

Ok, very sorry , I never meant to hurt list members who don't understand Tamil. I am sure you can ask someone. That is why I have also provided translations to the best of my ability.

Can anybody give me equally expressive and beautiful equivalents in English?

It is said that language is indicative of the intellectual culture of a race and the fact that India has both Tamil and Sanskrit is a matter of immense pride to us.

It is in our hands to prove to the world that even today we are no worse than our great forefathers.

Are you game?

Try passing "noirqdebug" to the kernel command line

Linux runs on most laptops, so shouldnt be big
problem,
 but heard from Mark Shuttleworth that Ubuntu should
work well on Thinkpads ;) (as most Ubuntu developers
use it)

+1 for Thinkpads. Check out the new Z60m. I think it's 56k. But worth 
it, from what I heard.

I vote for Lenovo too. It gets most supports which IBM Thinkpad does. I 
have been running Ubuntu since I got it, and am 100% satisfied. Though 
mine is a 'designed for Windows' laptop, still it runs Linux very well. 
I had issues in Fedora Core with my display as mine is a wide screen and 
it was filling up only 80 % of the screen and was running in 640x480 
mode. Still IBM Thinkpads offer a very good support for Linux.

OOPs...surely a mute point..but Werner Heisenberg proposed the Uncertainty
Principle.
P.A.M. Dirac and Schrodinger both developed Q.M. though in different ways,
independently.

Applying Heisenberg's uncertainty principls, good code and good coding style
may not be do-able at the same time. :))
So maybe, software firms need 2 people: one for good coding..other to make
it presentable.

I have seen people far advanced in coding logic, write horribly
incomprehensible code. I guess some people are really good at logic rather
than the style.

Like Gandhiji was supposed to have commented:
Teach your child to draw before he/she can write.

Maybe there should be a tool to do some heuristic analysis of what is
written and spit back the bad code to the programmer! That way, you
will get the right logic with bad code and  retain the good logic with
improved style!? ;-)

+1 for ThinkPads.
In fact I'm planning to get one, but though a bit heavy than the Z60m, 
I'm thinking of getting R60 (Core Duo, 512m, 80g, DVD-RW, etc) for 55K, 
sort of struck a deal.

which may not be the right thing to do. this appears to be a uncommon setup
(which may have a valid application, nevertheless) where the ifconfig is setting
up the local network on the host (lets call this kghost) to be 85.10.199.192/27
but the route statement routes packets to this very same subnet through the
gateway at 85.10.199.193. it would appear that this gateway at 85.10.199.193 is
connected to the host 85.10.199.207 through this interface, but other hosts in
the 85.10.199.192/27 connect to this gateway through some other means, so said
kghost has to forward packets to these other hosts to the gateway. presumably,
hosts in 85.10.199.x that are not part of 85.10.199.192/27 have some other
routing setup on kghost, perhaps the default route. doing the replacement above
would force kghost to route those also through the gateway at 85.10.199.192
which may or may not be the right thing to do. it would probably we the wrong
thing to do - cannot say for sure unless we know what the existing route on
kghost is for these hosts.

what hack? cidr (vlsm) has been around and is specified in rfc's that are more
than ten years old.

it would appear that the responder had missed the op's point about the new
addresses being in a different subnet. the old local addresses are
85.10.199.192/27 whereas the new addresses are 88.198.154.216/29. in fact, on
the basis of information given by the op, no answer can be provided. the
original route statement is there for a purpose as outlined in my above
paragraph. a similar route statement would be needed for the additional ip's if
a similar functionality is required, not otherwise. since this information is
not there in the posting, no valid advice can be given. any advice will need
full information about the existing routing to all destinations.

Sorry I don't follow you. I have been able to make multiple subnets talk to each other using a 255.255.0.0 mask wherein the actual subnets had more restrictive masks say 255.255.255.0 or something.

I kind of get your reasoning but I have more doubts than clarity.

Anyway I think this is not too big an issue to worry about.

AFAIK routers actually use longest prefix match to shove packets into the right interface. So I am guessing it might just work.

Hope Kenneth gets his computers talk to each other.

That's true. These days I see people (mostly students) who don't care
about properly indenting their code at all. They think that ``if it
runs, then it must be ok''. It's hard to explain the issues of code
maintainability to them. Personally I believe using any sane programming
editor (like GNU Emacs or ViM) solves most of the problem. Sometimes you
 may also need to beautify code written by other people, and in those
situations `indent` comes handy. I use `indent` with the following
switches --
indent -npro -sc -br -ce -cli2 -cbi0 -bap -psl -bad -i8 -nut -sob -l75
- -ss -ncs -nlp

That is my own style which is a hybrid of K&R & the GNU style. I hope it
is useful ...

BG

Hey Guys,

I have a Transcend DDR 333 Mhz 256 MB RAM module for sale. I recently 
upgraded the RAM in my R51, and rather lately realized that it has only 
one expansion slot, which is already taken by this module :(. So I'm 
using the new 512 MB one, and I have this used (approx 1 year) 256 MB 
RAM module available.

Get in touch by mail if you're interested, I will give it for half the 
original purchase price.

Vamsee.

ilugc had developed some unknown problem and stopped sending out messages 
a couple of days ago. i dont know what the problem was, but it seems to be

Subject: [Ilugc] Gentoo Linux, NetBSD,
	OpenBSD and FreeBSD on the same SATA hard disk
Message-ID: <20061105104522.GA26070@lakshmi.susmita.org>

Hello Guys,

      I wonder if you guys remember; long time ago there was a conclusion that since an i386 MBR partition table can hold only 4 primary partitions and since most common OSes can only boot from an active primary partition the practical limit for multi boot is 4. 4 per hard disk.

      This is what I did. I have a 160 GB SATA disk with a spanking new Celeron processor and some M5VM800 motherboard. Anyway I give details to emphasize the fact that this is brand new BIOS.

      Now, restrictions on booting beyond a certain cylinder limit is imposed mostly by BIOS though some OSes also have/had this issue.

      And remember that whatever you read about this from anywhere on Internet is not trustworthy. As always a healthy dose of skepticism is your best friend...

      Anyway coming back to the point, I installed gentoo on the first 40 GB of the disk. Then I installed NetBSD on the second 40 GB. OpenBSD on the third and finally FreeBSD on the remaining 40 GB.

      Now, by no means is this non trivial. Please don't think you can try this without understanding how the hard disk is partitioned, what is the meaning of cylinders,tracks,head and sectors and the nuances and differences between how various OSes report these values.

      Also you should thoroughly understand BSD disklabels and how this differs from traditional linux or Windoze partitions.

      Quite simply disklabeling happens inside fdisk partitions. i.e., each of the FreeBSD,NetBSD and OpenBSD fdisk partitions you see below contain individual /, /usr, /home mount points inside each respective fdisk partitions using BSD disklabeling partitioning.

      IOW I am trying my level best to tell you that it is not humanly possible to explain everything to you. There are several corner cases and dark corners that I have not run into.

      Prior familiarity with installing each of the individual OSes does help but it is not mandatory as long as you understand the CHS partitioning, disklableling etc.

      Of course I installed grub on the MBR of the disk and I used gentoo grub. Grub is shipped with BSDs also but I used gentoo grub.

      Here is my grub.conf.

<<<<grub.conf>>>>
      
default 0
timeout 10

splashimage=(hd0,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz

title Gentoo Linux
root (hd0,0)
kernel /boot/kernel root=/dev/sda1

title NetBSD
root (hd0,1)
chainloader +1
makeactive

title OpenBSD
root (hd0,2)
chainloader +1
makeactive

title FreeBSD
root (hd0,3)
chainloader +1
makeactive

<<<<grub.conf>>>>

     As you can see it is really easy to interpret it. I found that FreeBSD boot manager also can boot all OSes except linux. So I just reverted back to grub. Remember things will go wrong but make sure that you know what you are doing.

     Always be prepared to boot into the disk with a liveCD or gentoo bootCD(which itself is a liveCD) and then mount the appropriate partition, chroot into it and diddle around with grub...

     One thing that you should take especial care of is the fact that each o f the four primary partitions don't overlap and that they begin on cylinder boundaries.

     I am trying my level best to explain but as you can see this is not something that can easily be done. Experience is the only way.

     But prepare yourself well by arming yourself with good theoretical clarity.

     I shall endeavor to do exactly that.

     A hard disk is nothing but a bunch of vertically stacked rings or platters sitting on a spindle. Each platter has two heads on either sides. And each ring is split into multiple concentric circles called tracks.

     Each track is split into multiple sectors, yes same geometric concept. It is an arc.

     And tracks are aggregated into cylinders.

     It took me a very long time to understand this clearly. So please be patient. But once you understand it it is all very simple. :-)

     Each sector holds exactly 512 bytes.

     Another confusing aspect is that no modern BIOS cares about CHS translation as it is always LBA and it is also true that real geometry has very little to do with the geometry reported by various partitioning software. And each OS displays the same info in a different way.

     But it is not as complicated as I make it sound. Really.

     There is a certain consistency and the numbers match in a near about manner. Exact match doesn't always happen. For instance my NetBSD installer showed the disk capacity as 157 GB instead of 164 GB inside disklabel though at other places it showed the right value.

      Here is my linux fdisk output.

#fdisk -lu /dev/sda ( Remember it is SATA disk, for you it might be /dev/hda)

Disk /dev/sda: 164.6 GB, 164695473664 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 20023 cylinders, total 321670847 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1              63    78124094    39062016   83  Linux
/dev/sda2        78124095   160055594    40965750   a9  NetBSD
/dev/sda3       160055595   242308394    41126400   a6  OpenBSD
/dev/sda4   *   242308395   321669494    39680550   a5  FreeBSD


#fdisk -l /dev/sda



Disk /dev/sda: 164.6 GB, 164695473664 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 20023 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1               1        4863    39062016   83  Linux
/dev/sda2            4864        9963    40965750   a9  NetBSD
/dev/sda3            9964       15083    41126400   a6  OpenBSD
/dev/sda4   *       15084       20023    39680550   a5  FreeBSD

If you notice you will find that each of the four primary partitions don't actually overlap in any way and that each partition starts at a cylinder boundary.

Already it has got really technical and too intellectually stressful, so I will stop here.

One technical tip is that it is very easy to edit the fdisk and disklabels using raw sectors since that way you can easily figure out which partition you are dealing with.

For instance, if you know that the OpenBSD region on the disk is between sectors 25000000 and 3500000 then you know that each of the disklabel partitions should lie within this limit.

I have found excellent correlation between the raw sectors reported by each OS's fdisk output. And pay particular attention to the partition type. Linux is 0x83,NetBSD type is A9 (It used to be A5 before), FreeBSD partition type is A5 and OpenBSD's is A6.

Disk labeling is for BSD mount points and operate on a particular partition type, say A5 or A6. Since disklabels sit inside fdisk primary partitions.


Not talking of swap space and accessing each other's file systems, it is really not an issue once you get this right. I shall talk about it in the article.

I will write a detailed easy to understand article on this in a little while.

Wish you best of luck!

Best,
Girish

Not really zsh shell development, i.e. no C code :) I contribute to
the completion scripts provided... Much of the work in zsh, especially
the completion, is outsourced to the scripting side (Like Emacs, there
is a core, everything else occurs outside)

it moves on...

Message-ID: <9bdf087b0611050452q2bdf01bdm9d392b42889501fc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a MS comfort optical mouse 3000 which has a tilt wheel (scroll
left and right, up and down) and a thumb button in addition to the
left and right buttons. Right now in my Ubuntu install, the mouse is
working with these options - left click, right click, up/down scroll
and the thumb button works as left click. I want to configure the
mouse to enable the tilt function and use the thumb button as middle
click.

My current xorg.conf entry for mouse:

Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier     "Configured Mouse"
    Driver         "mouse"
    Option         "CorePointer"
    Option         "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
    Option         "Protocol" "ExplorerPS/2"
    Option         "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
EndSection

Can anyone give me some pointers on how to enable the tilt wheel and
the thumb button?

Great to hear ilugc is back, I had asked around on
#linux-india and no one was sure what had happened.
Think we can use to wiki to update members if such
occasions arise(I can take the responsibility).

I have never seen the sort of mouse you are describing though you did an excellent of asking the question.

Everyone should ask such clear, well formed and smart question like you.

Coming to the point perhaps,

       Options "Buttons" 7
       Option "ZAxisMapping" "4 5 6 7"

       might help? 

       Just a wilda** guess. :-)

Localization folks are most well versed in these things.

Anyway I shall contribute my mite.

Usually applications are layered on top of libraries that expose an API. This makes stuff well layered, well organized and clean.

And nearly 75% of the logic and code rests with the library. This library may be statically or dynamically linked(two types of dyn linking), and can be shared blah blah blah

So QT library implements the bulk of the infrastructure that KDE uses.

GTK library does the same thing for GNOME.

I understand that before placing a control i must first place container widgets (like vertical,horizonal boxes or tables ).
 
But when i insert horizontal boxes. All the boxes are of the same size. How do i change the size such that 1 of them is bigger and the other smaller.

After some googling I came this HOWTO:
http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=HOWTO+Mouse+Buttons
and I got the thumb button to work as middle click. Basically I used
xmodmap to change the middle click button. Still couldn't get the tilt
wheel to work.

glyphs to say:
> 1) What is GTK? How is GTK related with GNOME?

GTk+ is a high-level, cross platform GUI toolkit using which GUI
applications can be written. GTk+ itself is written in C but it provides
bindings for other languages as well like C++ (gtkmm), Python (PyGTk),
Java (java-gnome), Perl (gtk-perl), etc.
GTk+ was created for writing the GIMP, and then it was adopted and
enhanced by the GNOME team for creating GNOME. The GNOME project uses
GTk+ almost exclusively (in addition to some GNOME specific libs) to
write all GNOME applications. All GNOME apps are written in GTk+ no
matter which language is used to write the actual application. That
renders the distinct look and feel to all GNOME applications.
URL - http://gtk.org and http://gnome.org/

> 2) What is QT? How is it related with KDE?

Qt is yet another high-level, cross platform GUI toolkit created by a
Norwegian company Trolltech. Qt is mainly written in C++ but it has
bindings for different languages too. The KDE project uses Qt
exclusively for writing all KDE applications (again, no matter which
language is used for a specific app).
URL - http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/ and http://kde.org/

Hope that helps,

This should help.

#!/usr/bin/perl

use File::Glob ':glob';

for $i  (1 .. 99) {

	local ($cur,$new) = ();
	$cur = sprintf( "%02d", $i);

I suggest you first use xev to figure out if your X driver recognizes your tilt wheels. If not you are going to have a tough time as xmodmap can't help you then.

Assuming that you're using Bourne-compatible shell, the 
following command should do:

   for i in [0-9][0-9]; do mv $i 0$i; done

rename 's/(.*)([0-9][0-9])/\10\2/' *

(this is on Debian, I remember one more version on Redhat which used
to use glob patterns... don't remember the syntax exactly)

or on zsh: zmv -W '*[0-9][0-9]' '*0**'

it moves on...

zmv -W '[0-9][0-9]*' '0***'

anyway, if its a prefix, a simple for loop should do...

for i in [0-9][0-9]*; do mv $i 0$i; done

Place the widgets within the boxes. Set the 
expand/fill packing options in the Properties
dialog box as required.

Well I dont really have the problem to your solution . But i would like
you to answer some of my related queries. For some time now I have been
thinking of GUI programming on Linux. In the process i have tried KDE
-Qt with KDevelop, GNOME GTK and now I am thinking of GAMBAS or Python.
I really dont know what to choose since all of them except GAMBAS seem
complex to me. My primary need is that whatever i choose as the frontend
tool it should be able to easily interact with my C backend .

So what could be the solution ? Also point out some resources i might
refer to,
Any help will be appreciated.

I really appreciate the help.
but i faced some problems..
with the command " for i " i get the following error

mv: target `31-5-2006' is not a directory
mv: target `5-6-2006' is not a directory
mv: target `2' is not a directory
mv: target `2' is not a directory

here i think the command mv needs to be controlled.

i tried the for i command to write to a text file with the added prefix,  
it worked like a charm.

  for i in [0-9][0-9].*; do echo 0$i>> testrename.txt; done


then with the rename command i get the following

baluk@ubuntu:/media/hdb5/tvg-downloads$ rename 's/(.*)([0-9][0-9])/\10\2/'  
*
\2 better written as $2 at (eval 1) line 1.
\2 better written as $2 at (eval 2) line 1.
08.KSG - RADIO - 5-6-2006 not renamed:06 already exists
\2 better written as $2 at (eval 3) line 1.

frankly the syntax in rename is beyond my comprehension , me being a rough  
desktop user , however i tried it..

thanks a lot Chandrasekar and Ramkumar

i go to sleep with the conviction that by tomorrow You would have solved  
the glitches.

thanks once again

I had sent a second mail immediately in which I had changed the
arguments to rename. I had actually thought in the first mail that the
number was a suffix rather than a prefix. Please use the rename
command in the second mail. The "better written" warnings might still
come, but they can be ignored.

I have a doubt in the way the software is licenced
under GNU GPL. I will directly come to the point where
my doubt is with an example.

Redhat has developed the Redhat Directory Service(RDS)
based on openLDAP. Redhat would used the source code
from OpenLDAP for RDS, but is RDS under GPL. If so
will they give the source code of RDS free for use,
modify and redistribute.

Also one more example is Redhat Application stack
which has RHEL,JBoss,Apache,Mysql or Postgresql. But
in this package Apache, Mysql,etc are under GPL
licence and available free for use,modify and
redistribute. But how about the Redhat Application
stack package itself. IS this package also same as the others.

Are you sure you want to use C for backend? There are some very good 
bindings for gtk (this is what I prefer) in both Python and Ruby. Though 
PyGTK seems very popular, I haven't tried it. But I did try Ruby-Gnome2 
an while back, it was pure fun. There are good tutorials, so it's easy 
to get started. If you're on Ubuntu, the bindings install is as simple 
as sudo apt-get install ruby-gnome2 and you're on:

Gambas of course, is the point-and-click way of doing the same thing 
(and using basic-like language to tie it all together - eww).

My internet connections says 17hrs! for apt-get
Thanks to  Abishek. I made the link executable and eclipse started.
but when i try to select java perspective i get this error
"Problems opening perspective 'org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaPerspective'

If i try to open .java file i get this error
"Unable to create this part due to an internal error. Reason for the
failure: The editor class could not be instantiated. This usually indicates
that the editor's class name was mistyped in plugin.xml."

Any plugin is missing?

If I understand your question correctly:
If RDS is under the GPL, that means Red Hat is bound to give you the
source code if you ask them. Similarly, if you modify the source and
redistribute the program, I guess you must also release the modified
source under the same (GPL) license.

Apache is certainly not GPLed. MySQL is available under a non-GPL
license as well, which may not require you to disclose modified
source; but I don't know too much about these legal issues.

The backend development is almost finished in C and we are doing some
low-level networking stuff. That is why i would prefer the backend to
remain C. So can i mix up C backend and Python or Ruby - frontend ?

If possible please point out some specific resources

I have never used Daemons before. But I think they are the Linux equivalent of Windows Servies.
   
  So does an installed daemon start automatically at startup. How can we change the settings for a daemon.
   
  More importantly how do we create daemons(Is there any library/API) and how do we install them. It would be great if you could suggest me some links.
   
  I use Fedora Core 5.
   
  Thanks.

++1. Any modification done to a GPLed software make it necessary to 
release the source code of the modified software with it.

This is something I learnt some time back. When you create a new 
software using GPLed softwares, say MySQL, then it depends on whether 
you modified the MySQL's code whether you have to release the modified 
source code or not. What I mean to say is,

[1] if you use a GPLed software for your/within your software as it is, 
without any modifications, then you need not provide the source code of 
*that* software (not *yours* software).

[2] Instead, if you going to modify the GPLed software, then it is 
mandatory to release the modified source code of the GPLed software you 
use.

[3] But, this doesn't mean you *have* to release the source code of your 
software, even when you are using GPLed softwares as a part of the 
overall software.

[4] It entirely depends on the license of your software, that you need 
to/need not give away the source code.

The reason for [1] is mainly because, if your are using a GPLed software 
then its source code is freely available from the corresponding 
software's web site / repos, that you need not provide it with your 
software. But, if your going to modify a GPLed software, then the 
license makes it necessary for you to release the modified source code, 
but only of the software you modified.

This is behind a lot of softwares, which are not Open Source rather 
closed, using other FOSS/GPLed softwares in them and still remain closed.

I may have been wrong in some points, but as a whole think my 
understanding is right ?! :)

Yes.

Services in Windows are analogous to daemons in Linux/UNIX. When running
Linux daemons, the system admin chooses the user the daemon runs as. Admins
that are focused on security tend to create separate user accounts for every
daemon that's run. Each of these user accounts has its permisions in the
filesystem set so the daemon only has access to files and directories that
are absolutely required.

In the diagram below, the named daemon is runing as a user called *named*.
The ntpd daemon runs as user *ntpd* and the httpd daemon runs as user *httpd
*. User named only has permissions to access the /var/lib/named directory.
It cannot access any of the other two directories. A successful attack
against daemon named does not affect the /var/lib/ntpd or /var/lib/httpd
directories - or any other directory on the system.
[image: Linux daemons]

A successful attack against a vulnerable daemon tends to only impact that
daemon and its corresponding parts of the filesystem. Other parts of the
system are insulated from the attack.

Windows services often run as priviledged users with access to most or all
of the rest of the system. Successful attacks result in the entire computer
being compromised.

Certainly - you can use mkmf to tie up c code with Ruby. You might find 
this article helpful:

Hi Amit,

   Daemons are an integral part of UNIX culture and the BSD logo itself is derived from the BSD "demon" which sounds like daemon.

   It is thought of as black magic or sorcery since it silently sits in the background and does all the work for you. 

   It used to be a standard interview question "How to create  a daemon in UNIX?"

   But today you have the daemon(3) library call that does it automatically for you.

   It is a concept very easy to imagine and understand.

   Take the simple case of a web server.

   It is supposed to serve web pages and handle requests that arrive at port 80 in http or port 443 for https.

   There is no need for the web server to interact with the user or run on a terminal right?

   It is just like a sentry waiting at a port and services users.

   The fact that most of the users are remotely accessing services using TCP/IP is significant. 

   If you understand the concept underlying it, then details are only details and nothing more. :-)

   Without daemons UNIX systems are more or less useless. So the very idea of daemons are central to the UNIX philosophy whereas in Windoze I am sure services came as an afterthought...

   Anyway Rajagopal gave a nice explanation and I learnt lot of new details.

   Hope this helps.

   Should you have any more questions you are of course welcome to ask.

   But your best bet would be to study some good book say "UNIX network programming" by Richard L Stevens or some simpler book. That book is far too geeky for basics.

   You may be able to get some good website. Ask a UNIX guru whom you respect.

   I don't think mailing lists can clear fundamental doubts so easily.

   All the best!

   And of course welcome to the beautiful world of UNIX. :)

   Girish

Hi Raju,
> "Problems opening perspective 'org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaPerspective'
More possible that the extraction was not proper, especially if the
file was not executable in the first place! I am guessing that.

Java perspective is built into eclipse, so cannot be a separate
plugin. Just check the plugins directory for any directory named
org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaPerspective. If it is there, open the
plugin.xml in it and see if there are any path references, (must not
be).

Exactly, more or less a typo in the plugin.xml. Where did you get this
eclipse anyway?
I ll probably give the issue dates of lfy where eclipse was bundled
in. I use it and it works like magic. Moreover, if it is too early a
version of eclipse (maybe 3.0 and less) and you are not using java
1.4, you could end up with instantiation errors. But, I am not sure of
this case either.

He is probably asking that to prepare for an interview .. but the name
"Daemon" is not because of black magic or sorcery.  Think physics /
thermodynamics.

It is a reference to James Clerk Maxwell's 1867 proposition of Maxwell's
Daemon, which seemed to violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics.  [and
that's an old spelling for the word demon].

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_demon

http://www.multicians.org/thvv/7094.html?1

http://mail.computerhistory.org/pipermail/inforoots/2005-November/000979.html

Back during the 1960s, Prof Fernando Corbato and his team at MIT ran
"PROJECT MAC" on an IBM 7094 mainframe - which was more or less where
MULTICS originated.

The MIT people got that machine  on one condition .. the CEO of IBM at
that time (probably Vin Learson, who followed Tom Watson Jr. as CEO)
used to take part in yacht races, and had a program, or rather a job
deck (a set of punched cards), that'd calculate handicaps for various
yachts in a race.

Whenever that guy asked, Prof Corbato's team had to stop everything
running on that machine [which was running a timesharing system called

That was basically the reason they developed the concept of a "daemon"
to put a job in the background and keep running it, rather than to kill
the currently running job in order to run that yacht program deck.

Suresh,

	Thanks for the colorful history. 

	What I meant by black magic is that it is something difficult for newbies to understand. There was a time when kernel programming, kernel compilation, even sockets programming, nearly every single non trivial technical topic was looked upon as the handiwork of the devil...

	That is what I meant. Nothing with reference to daemon in particular.

	I wanted to emphasize the power and magic involved in this. 

	If P C Sorcar makes a train disappear we think of that as magic.

	Same way when Houdini escaped from the milk can everyone thought of it as magic.

	Now we know that it was Houdini's exceptionally strong shoulders and ability to open locks that accounted for this apparent "magic."

	Similarly until one learns C programming in the true sense everything appears incomprehensible and magical.

	What to talk of C? 

	My goodness, I have been programming in C for so many years now and I don't think I understand even 80% of it.

Quite frankly I found the device driver book to be somewhat advanced or rather not easy to relate to.

Having come from 8051 background I suggest you just take up a small hardware interfacing project either using the serial or parallel port or if you feel  ambitious enough the USB port.

Learn x86 assembly if you feel like. It is not reqd but coming from uC background this might be something you can relate to easily. Then there are some low level C I/O routines in linux inb(2) ,outb(2) and so on(man inb). Of course you can embed assembly code into your normal C program. I am assuming that you know C quite well since many embedded systems are programmed in C.

Then focus on character drivers and character devices first.

Just learn the serial protocol and interface something really simple like an LED array or something. 

Going from practice to theory may be faster in your case since you already have enough experience and an appreciation of hardware interfacing.

Once you get your hands dirty then pick up the book and read. It should make far more sense then.

Hope this helps.

Please post questions to the list so we can know how you are doing. :)

Wish you best of luck!

Girish

Satish,

	It still doesn't mean that you will have "a tough time". :)

	Sorry if I sounded rude, that was not the point.

	You will have to spend some more time learning and understanding things you would rather not but for this. :)

	So it is a blessing in disguise.

 Sudhakar,

 Any idea how to enable localized fonts on the console? With vim for instance? I think vim supports localization.

 Will UTF-8 fonts work?

 Thanks.

Hi,

I have a 15 inch Samtron colour monitor (model 56V) which has been used for
about 2-3 years.  I would like to sell it for about Rs. 2000, if possible.

If you can give me any suggestions on where in chennai I can find a buyer, I
would be very thankful.

this is totally off topic and an abuse of this list. Even commercial  
posts must be related to linux. Please try bazee.com or something

Glad to share with you all that we have received quite a number of Ubuntu
Edgy CDs.

This is intended for Tamil Users. We will assist in getting Tamil features
enabled. People in Chennai please drop me a mial off-line.

Others in Tamil Nadu we are workin out abt funds as to how we courier you!

To make it sure, this is intended and to encourage Tamil Users.  We indeed
have ideas of forming Ubuntu Tamil User Group mailing list through this.

We would like you to install Ubuntu, spread and share the Love of Ubuntu.

You must agree with me that it is taking the discussion on a different
plane... I was only asking advice from the list members (who have the
feature of being people interested in computers and living in chennai) for
something that was related to computers and commercial.

I am sure no-one will attempt selling used underwear on the list.

In any case I have already apologized for my behaviour.

Stepwise instructions - to view Unicode Tamil text

1. You need to have Unicode Tamil fonts installed on your computer and the
Operating System capable of rendering Tamil Scripts. Windows XP comes with a
Unicode Tamil Font (Latha) and you need not download/install a unicode font.
2. In the Control Panel, in Regional/Languages Options you will need to
ensure that Indic/Asian Language option is checked.
3. Use a browser that is capable of handling UTF-8 based pages (Netscape 6,
Internet Explorer 5) with the Unicode Tamil font chosen as the default font
for the UTF-8 char-set/encoding view. Unicode Tamil Fonts may be downloaded
from http://www.tamilnation.org/fonts/latha.ttf

Well, I use the basic eclipse that has only tomcat connectivity
options. If you use JBoss app server, then my version may not help
you. The exact details I will give, latest by tomorrow.

afaik, my version of eclipse can be downloaded from eclipse.org. The
latest ones 3.1 and above work pretty well with java 1.5

Wouldn't a [commercial] and [ot] do? Because, come on, let's face it. 
It's sometimes nice to get some bargains on old or unused equipment this 
way. I recently sold my extra RAM which otherwise would have been of no 
use to anybody. Of course we don't want to make the list a marketplace, 
but this list is implicitly a 'trust mechanism', which allows such 
transactions to take place less risk as we know each other as a community.

trouble is, we dont know where to draw the line - i think it's safest  
to keep anything non-linux out of here. Just wondering - 'linux  
compatible monitor for sale - my monitor has served tux for three  
years and i want it to have a good home, price 2k , 50% discount for  
genuine linux users'. On the serious side, there are more than enough  
web resources for things like this outside this list.

No, I am not asking the question for an interview. I am still a third year engineering student and inteviews are atleast an year away.
   
  Anyway, I wanted to know about daemons because I was wondering about how SAMBA works ? Actually I was thinking whether i could make something like SAMBA but with a lot of extra features.
   
  But thanks to all of you guys, I have gained a basic understanding of what a daemon is.

Queries on future purchase of hardware equipment and their
compatibility with Linux is ok. But I really would not like to see
this list become the official mailing list of Ritchie Street.

If this goes on, you will see grey-market PC assemblers advertise on
this list under the [COMMERCIAL] tag saying their CPU's/MOBO's deals
are LINUX compatible.

There's a bunch of ways to do a daemon that arent the "standard" way

Search for "runit" and dan bernstein's ucspi-tcp / tcpserver

Python-twisted. Best and easiest way to learn network programming. If
you are a python newbie, you will even pickup some py-skills.

A free book is available on the topic.

a bit OT and personal..

Why do you question every move that NRC-FOSS makes ?
The way I see it, they seem to be doing a good job.

Maybe you don't mean it but I see a tinge of cynicism every time KG
updates the LUG with NRC-FOSS activities/news. :)

[ thoughtless remark snipped ]

Guys,

	Please please let us not spoil the sanctity of this list.

	If you want this list to be the best in the world(which it already is in many respects) we should never entertain such thoughtless remarks.

	Let us get back to work.

No, python would be too slow for this sort of thing.

Anyway Amit, 
       There is a saying I am sure you have head.

       "Don't bite off more than what you can chew."

       You can only eat one meal at a time. If you want to build strong muscles, you can't do it in a day. It takes months.

       Samba was written by Andrew Tridgell after substantial hard work, sacrifice and technical plumbing and what not. In fact he quite frankly admits how hard a time he had when both he and his wife were doing a Phd while he was working on rsync.

       He is a physics graduate nothing to do with computers. But he has also done hardware hacking with Tivo.

       If you think you can do better than him please think twice.

       Nothing wrong in aiming for the moon, but one baby step at a time.

       I definitely do not mean to discourage you or anyone else in the list.
       But for heaven's sake be practical.

       If not anything else at least know yourself properly.

       What you can do , your energy levels, interest coefficient, where you stand with respect to the other smart folks on earth etc...

       That is why I love open source. Because in corporates it is very very easy to imagine that you are the smartest guy on earth since mostly it is politics and individual charisma and hierarchy that dictates technical respect.

       Whereas in the wild Internet marketplace, though there is politics you cannot in general get away with substandard code.

       So my advice to you Amit would be to wait and learn things. Don't jump into anything just because you find it cool.

       Try out simple projects first. You can start with answering questions on ilugc for instance.

       That will give you some confidence. Or if you are still unsure you can browse the archives for the simple students projects mail that I had sent to ilugc.

       Ppl mutilated me without understanding that I gave simple projects that students could do. Not some high sounding stuff to show my knowledge! :)

       You could pick one. Or do open ended learning and spend time with yourself thinking and try out various open source software that are simple to use and understand.

       Anyway enough said.

       Best of luck!

       If you really end up doing better than Tridge no one will be happier than us because someone from India doing such a great thing is no doubt a matter of immense pride.

       But at the same time let us be realistic.

Girish

Hi,

Hope most of you should have come across Free Software Magazine and TUX
Magazine.

They wonder me by their design.. The PDF format is absolutely superb,
particualarly TUX Magazine...

Need to how they are created, what are the tools involved for creation etc.,
I found few references in FSM itself but not that much informatory...

Any free software readily available to do such kind of an Magazine...

Please suggest...

Stepwise instructions - to view Unicode Tamil text

1. You need to have Unicode Tamil fonts installed on your computer and the
Operating System capable of rendering Tamil Scripts. Windows XP comes with a
Unicode Tamil Font (Latha) and you need not download/install a unicode font.
2. In the Control Panel, in Regional/Languages Options you will need to
ensure that Indic/Asian Language option is checked.
3. Use a browser that is capable of handling UTF-8 based pages (Netscape 6,
Internet Explorer 5) with the Unicode Tamil font chosen as the default font
for the UTF-8 char-set/encoding view. Unicode Tamil Fonts may be downloaded
from http://www.tamilnation.org/fonts/latha.ttf

The de-facto Free Software typesetting software is TeX and its
derivates. I'd imagine these magazines are created using TeX or LaTeX
or something derived out of TeX.

OMG I don't know TeX and I think it is too difficult to pick up easily and quickly.

You might look in to User mode linux - Kernel running as a user mode
application.
You can learn and debug without the hassle of rebooting your machine.

With a recent kernel do: make ARCH=um menuconfig

This is not correct, or is misleading as it is written. Nobody forces
anyone to release sources of his/her own modifications to any GPL'ed
software. I use several customized builds of various GPL'ed software
at my employer's, but I don't always release my patches. Secondly,
even if one distributes modified GPL'ed software, one certainly
doesn't have to release one's patches (ie, make them available for the
general public).

I had used nx6120 (99% same as nc6120). Ubuntu successfully auto 
detected all and worked fine (except 6-in1 memory card reader, which i 
did not test)

Sorry if I'm beating the Ruby horse too much around here - I'm sure 
there are equally good tools in other languages too, but this is what I 
know best, so I have to point out Austin Zeigler's PDF::Writer library:

http://ruby-pdf.rubyforge.org/pdf-writer/

And, it has excellent documentation too:

http://ruby-pdf.rubyforge.org/pdf-writer/manual/manual.pdf

 From what I heard, iText in Java isn't too bad, if you're more familiar 
with that language.


Vamsee.

OK My mistake.
   
  I just discovered that SAMBA is a lot bigger than what i thought. I had assumed that it's only job is to share directories across the network. This feature is what interests me and I was wondering whether it would be feasible for me to develop something which allows easy sharing of directories accross network and the facility to search for specific files in the network ( just like we search in a single system ). I hope atleast this is not very far fledged.

Hey all !
I just got beryl working on debian with fglrx drivers for radeon.
It took me a while to do this, though once figured its trivial.
If anyone running debian on radeon wants to know how to setup beryl ,
you can message me

- Your OS search functionality can search a samba share if it's mounted on
your system. Doesn't?

 Is there a way to search thru unmounted Samba/CISF shares provided
authenticaion is not required e.g: security=share in samba.

GPL does force you to release the modified GPLed source code if you

only binary of the modified source code publically.

Red Hat Directory Server was formerly Netscape Directory Server and was 
sold as a proprietary product. Red Hat bought this out and it is now 
under the GPL license with a exceptions clause. This is available as 
Fedora Directory Server with the complete binaries and under the same 
source license terms.

Apache is under the Apache license. Not GPL.

But how about the Redhat Application

Thought some of the packages are not under GPL, all of the SRPMS are 
published under http://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/enterprise.

I hope atleast this is not very far fledged.

The other day Bharathi asked me suddenly,

    ' Do you know something called dc++?'

    I asked him, 'What is that?'

    'Oh that is what people use in IIT to do file sharing'

I then came home and googled for it. Apparently it is some Windoze based p2p file sharing protocol. There are others Ares p2p and friends. 

Why don't you decode the wire protocol using tcpdump and develop a Samba like tool for linux? :)

Anyway if you are interested in doing research in file sharing you can start with bittorrent and learn what all people have done subsequently.

Samba had the specific goal of decoding the braindead Windoze file sharing mechanism. The equivalent in the UNIX world is NFS. AFS also can do the same.

NFS is from SUN. PAM is also from SUN. They both stink big time.

Unfortunately no one came up with a robust solution. There are various other remote file access mechanisms in the UNIX world I am sure list members can tell you.

Using FUSE you can export sshfs,davfs... OMG my brain is paining already. :)

Google for these terms and read about them. Down the line you can easily figure out what tingles your bones. 

Work on it and do something useful for yourself and the world. :)

It makes me wonder if you are thinking of bringing out such a magazine.
Well if it is then I share some similar ideas. You can just check out
this link http://www.geocities.com/dandolls/lprogs-journal/nov06/
This is a journal i have been taking out for the past 3 months. Well If
you think alike and think Big , may be we can do something better.

Care to explain why? Just because they are from SUN or you have other,

I don't know what these are, but I doubt these are typesetting programs.

TeX's proprietary competitors are InDesign and QuarkXPress, I'd say.

A quote of Mary Kay Ash would be appropriate here:

According to aerodynamic principles a bumble bee cannot fly. But the bumble
bee does not know this... so it keeps flying anyway.

When pakistan won the world cup, a reporter asked Imran Khan how even
debutant pakistani bowlers dont get overawed when they bowl to the likes of
Greenidge, Richards and company! Imran said most of them cannot read so they
probably dont even know who these guys are!

Would we have had linux if Linus allowed himself to be overawed by
Tannenbaum's reputation?

Very very sorry man. I don't mean to offend anyone. 

But I end up doing the same.

I had the dubious distinction of working with the innards of PAM long long ago in my first job. My goodness, it used to be so complex and the stupidity of the design hit me big time.

Of course that time I was not competent enough to guess that the problem was with the design of PAM...

The keywords "sufficient","required" etc. used to drive me mad. I could never correlate their intended meanings with the real English meaning.

I think ppl will agree with me that PAM is a necessary evil...

But talking of NFS. It is so ubiquitous that you even stop thinking of it as  evil. :)

And I am not really sure if one could do better. Since if one could there is no anecdote for me to quote.

I am sure with the newer versions a lot of bugs have been fixed and plenty of problems worked around but I have neither been tracking these changes nor have I actively used NFS.

Call it prejudice. I think it is just that. I make no bones about it. I am simply prejudiced against NFS.

I want to get rid of that of course. If you can help me it will be great.

Now, to answer your real question.

One big shot in SUN once told me that SUN actually is an "infrastructure" company. They make excellent hardware. Their sparc architecture and BLADE servers and what not are supposed to be one of the best hardware designs. SUN monitors are also top class. And really well integrated software solutions that run atop their top of the end hardware.

I am not talking about costs and affordability. I know that I can't even dream of owning one...

But several other SUN initiatives to succeed in the marketplace bombed as we all know. Anyway I am no biz guy and I don't know enough.

Now, it is a "favorite pastime" of open source folks, especially OpenBSD geniuses to flay all commercial organizations no matter how charismatic and huge they be in market share and mind share.

For instance if you read the slides of Henning Brauer on OpenBGPD http://unduli.bsws.de/papers/21c3/ you will see that he minces no words in flaying Cisco.

>From my own experience Cisco's IPsec implementation is a piece of ****.

Now, the best way to piss off everyone in ILUGC is to make this statement,

	"That Cisco routers are junk."

Juniper however seems to have got certain things right.

Since many of you believe that commercial alternatives and especially hugely successful and charismatic companies like google and Cisco actually have better products than competing open source alternatives are in for a huge shock/surprise.

That it simply isn't true. At least not always.

This goes to prove that open source culture breeds more competence,creativity and intellectual super stardom than the thick  confines of highly paying corporate jobs. :)

(Sounds like the cathedral and the bazaar by ESR, doesn't it? :)

However I think this is good news for most of us since we are open source folks. 

In a way none of the open source developers are much different from us since they also work for companies that make proprietary software.

So need to feel bad that in India we are poor and hence can't work on open source full time. :)

Only the really lucky folks have that leeway even in economically progressive nations...

ONLY if you distribute your modified version of the GPL'ed software. I
can modify GPL'ed software as much as I want, and the GPL allows me to
keep my modifications to myself so long as I don't distribute my
modified version to others.

Even if I do, I just have to provide my modifications to these others
and not to the general public.

After the hopelessly bitter, shocking experience I had with the best linux magazine in India I was determined to start a competing magazine and show that technical excellence will win end of the day.

It is similar to the statement that movie directors make.

 " We make such movies since the audience wants that."

Well, this is only an excuse. Not a fact. 

Similarly the stance that "we are number one" and India does not need high quality articles and hence this will do is the attitude that drove me mad for nearly a fortnight after my negotiations failed with that magazine.

I know at least 15 names in ILUGC at the top of my head right now who can write much better articles than any magazine anywhere on earth can produce.

However at least to begin with, we should have only an online PDF version.

That obviously implies that we get paid only thro' ads. 

Fighting against the  #1 magazine in India is by no means an easy task and we  have to do it slowly. Step by step.

As to the advantages of writing articles. Well I don't have to explain. 

 a) It clarifies your thought process

 b) You are forced to learn several new things

 c) You are forced to try out new things to write about them

 d) name and fame and glory and what not. :)

 How many of you find this idea attractive?

 We will see how it works for a month or two. Down the line if things work out really well(which it will), then we can even release print versions and convert it into a financial venture.

 No, I don't have time for that. 

 I will tell you how easy it is to get started on the magazine. We can use several of the questions and answers that are archived in the list and that come up each day to feed the magazine. NBD.

 It needs more structure than that but at least it is a good starting point.

 It is very essential to get the art part right. How many of you are good artists?

 Students? Anyone?

 It will be preferrable to do computer art directly but if you can draw well on paper that is also fine.

 English of course is not at all a problem since I have never seen a single mail in ILUGC with grammar or spelling errors.

 Then what are you waiting for?

 Let us start. :)

regards,
Girish

PS:- If the idea of "fighting" sounds childish to you let me tell you that this is the attitude that West has towards everything they do. Only in India we stupidly believe that "fighting spirit" is a bad attitude. To do good we fight evil; What can possibly be wrong with that?

Yes, I also understand it this way.

1. You can take GPLed software and modify it for internal purposes  without
any obligations
2. Only when you distribute the modified version to others and the other
person asks for the source code you are required to provide the modified
source code.

GPL does not mean that you have to put up your code on the internet for
everyone to download. If you have a closed group of clients who have no
interest to compete with you or release the source code to the outside
world, you can even have a business similar to closed source companies.

All the open source companies provide sources for download for goodwill of
the developer community to my understanding.

Ramanraj might know better.

Ma Sivaumar

I think I should learn Tex if I have to do something serious.

Then can some ILUGC genius guide me please?

Some good resources, or a small tutorial to begin with?

Thanks.

I was told about something called "metapost."

I grew fidgety the moment I saw it had something to do with LaTex.

Is it time consuming to learn ? Are there good resources?

Mano,

	Hmmm, Very interesting perspective. In fact a very highly respectable, knowledgeable friend once told me this.

	"Sometimes ignorance is bliss. That is why I like freshers."


	I could see that maybe he has a point. But I really think that ignorance is darkness. How can it ever be bliss?

	Perhaps for people who like a life of delusion.

	For instance children are so happy because they are ignorant.

	I don't think we can apply this all the time.

	You are talking about Pakistani bowlers who need "brute force" more than intellect.

	Even in the intellectual area Larry Wall said, " I did not know that it was impossible. Otherwise I would not even have tried it."

	So it is of course good to have confidence. But I would rather have true confidence that comes out of hard work and experience than some imaginary one.


	Btw, I never meant to say that you should get overawed by someone's charisma. 

	Before fighting, build your army. That is all.

	Don't underestimate the strength of your adversary.

	Anyway it is futile to talk about these subjective things.

	Just prove it in action. :)

	Simple. No need to talk then.

Girish

scribus is a dtp application - doing well, but a long way from  
pagemaker or quarkXpress. Typesetting became obsolete long ago.

our thought was to create a journal of such kind in Tamil and encourage
students and professionals to develop the art of technical writing in Tamil.


Since the methodology is going to be the same, we can for sure work
together... Please let me know your comments...

We do take this oppurtunity to invite users to write GNU/ Linux articles in
Tamil and send it to ubuntu.thamizh@gmail.com We will be much pleased to
published them in our wiki pages and distribute it among users.

These can begin with simple user manuals like, Installation How tos etc.,

The art of technical writing in native language should be cultivated.

My Tamil is not good enough for technical writing. I will submit articles in English.

Can't you get it translated? I think it should be possible.

I am not sure if everything can be expressed in Tamil.

Not easy.

Even Germans and Japanese cannot escape from learning English if they are in the technical field.

We can help beginners, but going forward they have to learn English.

There is no other way. Or this can help folks who are weak in English.

I love Tamil more than English. I have clearly expressed my love and respect  for the greatness of the language.

But UNIX commands are not in Tamil. Man pages are not in Tamil...

So I think a good mix is what is needed without getting too religious about either.

Well, the latest November edition of TUX magazine impressed me a lot. To be
cirulated it has to be pdf which can also be made available online.

Print edition, well not enough funds right now ;-)

Its just a thought... Should take some time to evolve... Give your
feedaback...

I have no first hand knowledge of this but The Unix Haters' Handbook
[1] has an entire chapter dedicated to trashing NFS.  The main thing
seemed to be the "sucky" idea of assuming that file transactions are
stateless or so.

Amit,

	I hate the fact that you are linking to IBM and linuxjournal.

	If the magazine be yours it should be purely original.

	You are repeating the mistake of ***.

i feel scribus + inkscape + gimp + blender would be fine for this -  
we can produce it as if it was print and distribute as a pdf for the  
time being.

we could use a collaborative authoring application - silva running on  
zope would be nice as it has enough version control and workflow  
features for our purpose - to write the articles. I ran a print  
newsmagazine for several years. That was in my doze days and i used  
corel draw, photoshop and page maker.

And BTW this seems to solve several localization problems too. :)

Unless I am grievously mistaken.

Localization has been dogging me for years now.

But I wonder where does docbook fit in? 

Is SGML/XML a big departure from TeX?

"Zaroor dal mein kuch kala hai." as they say in Hindi. Something fishy.

It's TeX.  From tau-epsilon-chi, pronounced so that it rhymes with
"blecch" according to Knuth in "the Name of the Game" chapter in The
TeXbook.  On the other hand, I think Lamport says you can pronounce
LaTeX any which way in "the Game of the Name" in LaTex (the book).

Already involved in Ubuntu Translations. When more volunteers come, it
should not be a problem. :-)

>> I am not sure if everything can be expressed in Tamil. Not easy.

Not easy. I agree. But not impossible.

>> We can help beginners, but going forward they have to learn English.
>> There is no other way. Or this can help folks who are weak in English.

There has to be a way.
6 crore of Tamil speaking population. and hardly few lakh know English
properly.
Read an article in Ananda Vikatan, this few lakh people are creating a kind
of Inferiority complex among the rest of the population.
good brains out them leave the land, since they have plenty to get outside
with their English skills :-(

Think of the time it will take when every one could learn English to access
technology. Rather the few lakh who know both english and tamil should
contribute. Off course in other languages too...

>> So I think a good mix is what is needed without getting too religious
about either.

Nothing too religious here. Give access to technology to people through
their own language. So simple isn't it?

*Please do not reply to these, it will divert the topic. I feel. *

*To  remind, the thread is about making magazines like FSM & TUM... in
common...*

Hi;
It is actually pretty easy to learn latex. or you can use tools like
lyx, klyx to make your job easier. google has answers to every
problem that you may face with latex.
you would definitely need xfig along with latex as you may need to
create drawings and export it as an eps file which can then be used
in side latex.
K.Shyam
PS: after having used some serious latex for the past two years, once
you see the output you can produce with it, you would trash any other
documentation system (that includes openoffice)

i am looking at this as an opotunity to polish my writing skills in  
tamil - if we set up a collaborative authoring system for writing the

Yes. Shall we use fsf-tn mailing list or create some other mailing list for
encouraging users writing articles in Tamil ?  Can some one send fsf-tn
mailing list's info page?

What was the prime intention in creating the fsf-tn mailing list? Is it
really active?

first see if there are people who want to be encouraged to write in  
tamil. Then, if there are enough of them, then worry about separate  
mailing lists - right now, we can keep the discussion on this list.

agreed. That was just a random thought expressed  and a reply to your query
for someplace in general.... :-)

>> first see if there are people who want to be encouraged to write in
tamil.

I know few. any one feeling encouraged here? KG, how about persons at
AU-KBC? One article a week/ fortnight (however small it may be) will do
good...

we can put up a site with a collaborative authoring software for

Hi Girsih,

Enabling SCIM is same in vim as you will do for either gedit or openoffice ... Once you installed SCIM , it will be enabled to gedit , openoffice and vim ( all graphical and text editors ) ... 
You can input different langauge in vim as below ... 

Open Terminal-->vi <fileName> -> press enter (Enter into insert mode) --> press ctrl+space to slect langauges --> Select the langauge you need  --> type with the language you have selected. 

If any doubts let me know ... 

Regards
Chandu

 Sudhakar,

 Any idea how to enable localized fonts on the console? With vim for instance? I think vim supports localization.

 Will UTF-8 fonts work?

 Thanks.

I don't know what you mean by a Windows based protocol. The details of
the protocol are well known and there are many clients for Direct
Connect protocol in Linux as well... linuxdcpp, dcgui2, rccp, valknut,
microdc etc. In fact, some of them (like microdc) outperform their
windows counterparts in terms of performance. As a matter of fact,
dc++, the primary client for Windows (there are others which have
forked off it) is Free Software and linuxdcpp is its Linux port.

My personal opinion... DC is one of the better p2p protocols existing
today... You can look at the website for the features :)

it moves on...

i could set up a moinmoin wiki - one thing moinmoin has not been  
translated into tamil - and start writing tamil articles there - as  
long as you do the correction ... and maybe someone will translate  
moinmoin to tamil

I dont agree that typesetting has become obsolete. its defacto standard even now  for many scientific journals which ask for latex files. ofcourse users realizethe superior quality of the output too :)

If u need to start with latex in a day with basics:
http://ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english

for further command index refer to:
info latex

Then u can see the usage of other sophisticated latex packages @ CTAN according to ur requirement.

moinmoin to tamil

Yep

*This is general concern I have for any translations:*

But the follow up after a version is translated? when newer version gets
released, simultaneous translation need to be done. this has to be taken
care. A team should always focus on one/ few application. Study it, maintain
it and upgrade it periodically.. Lets not discuss this now... its diverting.

Stepwise instructions - to view Unicode Tamil text

1. You need to have Unicode Tamil fonts installed on your computer and the
Operating System capable of rendering Tamil Scripts. Windows XP comes with a
Unicode Tamil Font (Latha) and you need not download/install a unicode font.
2. In the Control Panel, in Regional/Languages Options you will need to
ensure that Indic/Asian Language option is checked.
3. Use a browser that is capable of handling UTF-8 based pages (Netscape 6,
Internet Explorer 5) with the Unicode Tamil font chosen as the default font
for the UTF-8 char-set/encoding view. Unicode Tamil Fonts may be downloaded
from http://www.tamilnation.org/fonts/latha.ttf

Stepwise instructions - to view Unicode Tamil text

Unicode Tamil Font (Latha) and you need not download/install a unicode font.
2. In the Control Panel, in Regional/Languages Options you will need to
ensure that Indic/Asian Language option is checked.
3. Use a browser that is capable of handling UTF-8 based pages (Netscape 6,
Internet Explorer 5) with the Unicode Tamil font chosen as the default font
for the UTF-8 char-set/encoding view. Unicode Tamil Fonts may be downloaded
from http://www.tamilnation.org/fonts/latha.ttf

Will do it at a later part of the day..

need not, I guess, Unicode supported browser its easy... but giving Tamil
Name will actually make the URL look a bit crazy... Ubuntu wiki pages in
Media Wiki are Titled in Tamil. Lets try.

Guys,
	I  hear quite a lot about digital signatures in India. That you will require that for credit card purchases and tax filing.

	I am told that some company in Blore provides solutions for this.

	What exactly is going on? 

	Who is going to manage the keypairs and who is going to issue certificates?

	I am told this has huge biz potential. But I think the biggest customer may be the govt. in which case ...

	Anyway if you know something about it please share it.

	Thanks.

Girish

Did you see the link that i posted ?
(http://www.geocities.com/dandolls/lprogs-journal/nov06/).
It is actually a compilation of the various group posts . This is indeed
a good idea and so we really wont need to go for article "hunting" at
least for a part of the content.I have written articles mainly for
LinuxGazette. And for my own blog / site. So i am in for the venture as
a technical writer mainly.

Who is willing to be the in-charge ? Some one needs to be in charge to
co-ordinate and synchronize the whole thing. 

We can primarily start off with a online PDF/HTML version as suggested
by you. And then may be venture off to the unconquered PAPER
territories.

What do you think ?

Whenever I need to install a software on my system (from source code) I have to execute the usual ./configure, make, make install commands.
 
Let us say I have made a simple hello world application ( using only a text editor ). How can I make the configure files for it. Isn't it too complex of shell scripting for newbie's ? Then how come every little software has one.
 
Need your view.
 
Thanks.

I remember to have read in newspapers that the digital signatures will
be used in corporate tax filings. It's especially important because
starting this year online filing has been made compulsory. Corporates
will be provided with some sort of certificates (possibly X.509) that
they will maintain on some devices (Secure USB key, TPM, smartcard) -
This certificate will later be used in filing.

The GPLv3 draft includes new conditions that may change that. I wrote 
about the concerns there to the  fsf-friends list at 
http://mm.gnu.org.in/pipermail/fsf-friends/2006-August/004230.html :

Freedom 0, "the freedom to run the program, for any purpose", seems to
be twisted out of shape by the draft GPLv3.

GPLv2 says: "The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
output from the  Program is covered only if  its contents constitute a
work based on the Program  (independent of having been made by running
the Program)."

GPLv3  draft rewrites:  "This  License  permits you  to  make and  run
privately modified  versions of the  Program, or have others  make and
run them on your behalf."

The attempt to maintain distinction between "private" and "public" use
of the  program licensed is  not easy and anyway  only discriminatory.
Is it that  non-internet users can use free  software for any purpose,
but internet  users who connect to  the world wide web,  have to loose
that freedom? 

Freedom 2  can easily  be wiped out  with additional terms  that allow
trademark  conditions which  would prevent  simple  redistributions to
even  friends  and  neighbours.   The  trademark claims  made  by  ssh
trademark owner upon  openssh developers is a good  lesson not to give
room for needless and self-defeating disputes within the free software
community.

Contributions could go up in flames or be appropriated by trademark 
owners with such additional terms.

The spirit of the free software movement is as old as Thirumanthiram or 
any of our ancient works - Thirumoolar said "nan petra inbam peruga 
ivvaiagam" as the reason for his work.  It takes a great deal to 
complicate that :)

Message-ID: <e70ef6930611071713o6f899304t8b499ad19b96d7ba@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Today morning, in the Hindu there was an ad on the 19th page for Acer Aspire
Laptops which come with Linux.
The fine print states that
"The Linux that is pre-loaded is a free version and would have limited
functionality until another operating system is installed"
Have anyone has any experience with these laptops and what kind of *limited*
functionalities does it have?

If you are talking about Acer Aspire 3002NLC or anything similar, the
shipped distribution (some Linpus) is total crap.. Doesn't even have
X... I almost took their initiative to ship that as some tactic to
drive people from Linux... So, you will need to install some other

As far as hardware compatibility is concerned, I guess there aren't
any major hassles except for the SIS graphics card for which DRI
support is not yet available. Please check the archives... I think I
once posted my experiences with the laptop...

it moves on...

about a year ago, a friend bought two of these. Both were 'dozed' by  
the retailer himself, but he retained one as dual boot to show me. It  
had suse on it, and everything was working. This was the 50-60K range

Perhaps you have heard about KDevelop. Since you are using FC5 chances
are that you have them installed already. Just design your "hello world"
app using KDevelop and everything will be done i.e the configure files
etc will be created for you.

It is an artifact of "improper" POSIX compliance. Usually standards bodies have the ill repute of coming with odd or nonsensical ideas and sometimes it would not make much practical sense to follow standards.

With RFCs this is less of a problem but "controlled" US standards organizations normally don't inspire respect from implementors.

As a result of this and various other factors, commercial and free UNIX clones have ended up being POSIX compliant to various degrees.

This is what the configure script aims to detect.

For instance, in some OSes there would be index(3),some strchr(3) and many both. :)

So as a user space code developer you will have a really tough time if you wre to put #ifdef statements in the code to detect the OS . Sometimes things change between patchlevels and libc versions.

If your code is really simple without much external dependencies and fully ANSI compliant, then you don't need configure at all.

Anyway to answer your question there is a tool called autoproject that will give you a configure skeleton.

This is hardly the right example to prove your point, considering
strchr() is required in conformant standard C library implementations
whereas index() is not specified by any standard. Any programmer who
uses index() is writing non-portable code.

What makes you think a bowler does not need 'intellect'!! IQ as a measure of
intellect has been trashed by researchers. Intellect can only be measured by
ones achievement in one's chosen field. So, if you ask me, I would say
Sachin Tendulakar or Ronaldinho or Michael Jordan are as intelligent as
Linus Torvalds.

        Even in the intellectual area Larry Wall said, " I did not know that

Every child is born with all the hardware (the neurons) interconnected. The
environment that one grows in strengthens some connections. So if the
connections that handle math and logic is strong you end up with a high
score in an IQ test and can call yourself 'intelligent'. But to think that
someone who has strong connections in the areas that handle eye, leg, hand
co-ordination are brutes is silly! I would'nt call Picasso dumb because he
cannot solve simple math problems! He had a view of the world which was
beyond our imagination.

You should read V S Ramachandran's 'The Emerging Mind' or listen to his BBC
Reith lectures (available on the web). And although somewhat superficial
Malcom Gladwell's 'Blink' to understand what 'intellect' is.

regds,
mano

I've got the one with linpus basic edition. strange.. linux a fedora
derived distro has even rpm removed from the installation leave alone
the X and better eye candy.
I am talking about Aspire 5551.

but it works kubuntu dapper all.. bluetooth, wifi, sound and the jazz.
no luck with debian though.. with the matshita DVD-RAM does not seem
to be supported. so no cdrom after the boot from the installer.

if anyone had luck with debian do post back :)

cheers
Vivek

OK, I had the same problem with SATA based CD/DVD-ROM's. I just used
Debian Sarge and did a minimal installation. For some strange reason
Debian Sarge managed to identify the DVD-ROM and Debian Etch didn't. I
think it's because Sarge used libsata for it's kernels and Etch would
be using libide.

After installing the minimal version of Sarge, do an apt-get upgrade
to the latest version of Debian.

Make sure you use a rather more bleeding edge variety of debian (etch
with latest updates) and then keep probing for new hardware.

Been there done that.. :(

I had yesterday's daily build. Ubuntu's installer detects it as
MATSHITA DVD-RAM UJ-850S

I tried out the instruction on this page

http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/SataAtapiHowto

right now.. installing Ubuntu Dapper.

I tried enabling the libata as talked about in the debian wiki and
loading drivers one by one. No luck :(

Subject: [Ilugc] linuxjournal back issues
Message-ID: <20061108110054.GA21003@lakshmi.susmita.org>

Folks,

	Please excuse me in case I am not following some established protocol or scheme well known in this list.

	What I am proposing is very similar to the wiki we have for linux and other free software CD distribution.

	I have a lot of linuxjournal issues lying idly in my chest.

	I would love to share it with you all since to the best of my knowledge linuxjournal is not available easily in shops in Chennai.

	Moreover it is very expensive.

	My idea is to make it available in such a manner that it remains available. So if one of you comes forward to broker the lending and receiving it back it will be great.

	Interested person can send me personal mail.

	Thanks.

regards,
Girish

Was that meant to be "nice". Sounds rather skeptical.

But I should repeat that if you got used to Latex you might just stick
around to using it and thrash most word processing apps.

Bharathi has agreed to broker as I got no mail in response to this.

He has some idea. You can bug Bharathi henceforth. :)

Sorry for responding late but I was indisposed for a while. I had
compiled the driver on a Ubuntu dapper system which comes with Kernel
2.6.15. Even though MODULE_PARM was deprecated (which I only came to
know recently), there was no compilation errors due to it. So I
foolishly thought the code is going to compile for all the future 2.6.x
versions. Looks like the kernel developers decided to remove MODULE_PARM
completely. Now that I upgraded to 2.6.17 (with edgy), I can see the
compilation problems myself.

I've tested the driver for 2 days now. It works for me without problems.
Perhaps, it's some peculiar combination of hardware that's causing
problem at your end. If this isn't solved yet, you should probably try
loading the driver after all other drivers are loaded.

Hey Binand,

    You are a genius!

    It is indeed TeX.

    Check out http://www.lulu.com for instant gratification for those who want to publish anything ranging from print books to online books to calendars to photo albums. 

    linuxjournal is coming up an article on using TeX and lulu in the December issue. Too bad it is not Dec yet! :)

hi

Suzhi is an attempt to encourage writing foss documentation in tamil.  
Since it is in wiki form, it is easy for more experienced people to  
correct the language of the newbies. I was experimenting with page  
headings in tamil. How many can access this:

http://nrcfosshelpline.in/Suzhi/ 
??????????_?????????

i also request authors to put links to their articles on the front  
page. If there are a bunch of related articles, they may put a link  
to a contents page on the front page and links from there to the  
other pages.

Copy paste works! Yes.. Thats how we do... those who know the technical
aspects of URL and how its resolved to reach a Web address should
help....:-(

Only way to make it work by clicking is to give this long URL, (thats how
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/Suzhi/??????????_????????? is resolved)

http://nrcfosshelpline.in/Suzhi/%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%86%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%8A%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D_%E0%AE%89%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%AE%E0%AE%99%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D

Some authoritative body/ forum has to take effort to resolve this...

Just search for ???????, u can find Ubuntu related pages posted so far.

Search for ?????????, u can find a simple manual of installing remington

Use gnu autotools (autoconf, automake, etc..). IDEs such as KDevelop
should let you do a lot of this automatically., but learning to use the
'gnu build system' should help in the longer run.

Thats pretty interesting. Does this mean., that if you purchase a
key-pair from the CA., you'll have to ditch your current key-pair? Does
it make sense to sign your current key-pair with the purchased key-pair
to prove authenticity?

You don't purchase key pairs from the CA; you purchase certificates.

What do you mean by key pair, anyway?

Aw., I thought a certificate was a public-private key pair signed by the
CA., certifying the identify of the owner. Did i get it wrong somewhere?

The public key, private key pair.

The private key, you donot reveal to anyone, not even
to the CA. You send your public key along with your
credentials to the CA. The CA will certify it for you
and issue you a digital certificate.
  You don't necessarily have to ditch your old key
pair. You can send the CA, the same old public key +
your credentials and ask them to issue you a
certificate.

> Does it make sense to sign your current key-pair

> to prove authenticity?
  
  Yes, you can do that, its a roundabout way.
Moreover, its not the key-pair you need to sign, its
the public key alone that needs to be signed, in this
case.
  Your private key if for you alone and not to be
shared. 

This wikipedia link should help you clear most of it
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request

As for TCS- if you trust them(TCS) and if the person
verifying your authenticity trusts TCS- you can use
them as a CA.

Sarad.

Ah OK. The certificate is only the public key signed by the CA. You
generate the keypair, and send only the public key to the CA - who
certifies your identity and attaches it to the key. What you actually
purchase from the CA is the certificate (certifying that you are who
you claim to be, say securesection.mysite.com or Binand
Sethumadhavan).

I think your initial question was more related to the keypair
generated by tools like gnupg ("Does this mean., that if you purchase
a key-pair from the CA, you'll have to ditch your current key-pair?")?
Gnupg ("web of trust scheme") and the CA-based system ("PKI scheme")
are completely disjoint, PKI is the one that is more practical for
authenticating several thousand clients to a tax-filing website, for
example.

   Just about every mobo with onboard graphics today has some
features (mostly related to the graphics engine) that are closed or
undocumented - whether you go with ATI, NVidia or even Intel.
If you want *full* Linux support you may have to go with an add-in
AGP/PCIe card that is fully supported.

    I have no clue about what you mean my low cost, but if it's
loaded with 1 GB of DDR, it probably doesn't meet my definition.

   My baseline low-cost configuration today would have an i810T/
i815T motherboard with a Tualatin 1.2 GHz Celeron for about Rs.2k,
with not more than 256 MB of SDRAM scrounged from somewhere.
FC4 with Xfce desktop, and I'm done.

   For a little more (say around 5k), I could probably get a S754+
Sempron combo.

Yes and we need to authenticate the CA too.

The unfortunate thing about the TCS-CA is that you
will have to do a one time import of the TCS's
certificate, unlike Thawte, VISA or Vesign whose
certificates comes default with the Firefox web
browser.
   There is really know way to know if there is a man
in the middle attack underway(though unlikely), when
you download and import the TCS certificate.

Sarad.

Just thinking aloud... Since we already have input methods to convert
transliterated english text to other languages (like Tamil), I guess
having some webserver rewriting module or something on the cms side to
convert a transliterated part of the url to the actual url (assuming
we have a single language for a subtree) should be possible.. That
should get us neater urls...

it moves on...

Hi All,

I have a strange routing problem.

Environment:
FC1, Tata Indicom CDMA Landline (1500 unlimited internet plan)

I am connected to internet and everything is working fine on this (host)
machine.

But internet is not available to other machines on network. Other
machines are FC3 and FC4. Networking is working fine.Only problem is
that they are not able to use internet.

Local IP (FC1): 192.168.0.2

Some diagnosis:
1) Ping is working fine from FC4 & FC3. Ping to google.com worked fine.
2) Traceroute is also working fine from FC4 & FC3
3) wget -c http://www.slashdot.org is able to fetch index.html file,
Firefox is not able to open site.
4) Thunderbird is fetching emails fine from client machines
5) GAIM is also working fine from client machines

Script used for routing:
iptables -F; iptables -t nat -F; iptables -t mangle -F
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Please let me as what i am missing.

Same network/routing works when using Reliance Landline dial-up.

Hi Shrinivasan,
I am not sure how to get the ubuntu packages inside Debian.

My understanding is Debian might have built firefox without indic language
support (Ubuntu/fedora does).

But if you like you can try using the indic firefox (2.0.rc3)  build I have
here: http://thamizha.com/modules/mydownloads/viewcat.php?cid=11
I should render tamil fine.

    As you can see, that is not a very practical
solution. There can be thousands of clients and we
can't expect every one to go running around to the
nearest TCS office, even if they have this facility.
All the clients need not even be from India! We have
already a narrow scope for such a system, not to
mention it is cumbersome.

    CA's are for making authentication easier, not
difficult.
    To make it fool proof they need to tie up with
popular browsers and make the browser ship with their
certificates.

Sarad.

This problem should not come had u installed *language-support-ta* package.
Without installing the language pack firefox can render proper unicode
scripts in the following ways,

First try this,

From the terminal,

*$ export MOZ_DISABLE_PANGO=0*

then refresh any unicode web site, say www.ubuntu-tam.org ;-)

Hope it should work fine. This is temporary fix. You have to do this every
time u sign in. So for a permanent fix,

edit,

*/etc/environment*
**
and add the following line,
**
*MOZ_DISABLE_PANGO=0*
**
Log off and Log in back. Hope this should help resolve the issue.

The Chennai IIT Ubuntu Mirror has the following folder,

http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/ubuntu/pool/main/l/language-pack-ta/

Two interdependent packages,

*language-pack-ta & language-pack-ta-base *should be installed (GNOME), For
an Ubuntu desktop, I will just do,

$  sudo apt-get install language-pack-ta language-pack-ta-base

Debian? try installing from source :-)

apt-get install ttf-tamil-fonts

I'd prefer ttf-indic-fonts to get all of them...

Check the encoding of the browser is set to Unicode UTF-8. By default it
might be some Western...

Why? Debian packages are available for fonts as well as for
localizations. For example, getting a Tamil KDE is achived merely by
installing kde-i18n-ta and setting language to Tamil in KDE Control
Center.

Used to be a very informative and crisply written, especially for the
majority of us who can't spend time looking through all the Debian
lists for the interesting news. Though this as such is not that
serious, but the reason why it was stopped is a rather sad one...

http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200610250942

I am confused actually, but can't help agreeing in parts with Martin
Schulze actually. What really hurts is that an effort like Dunc-Tank,
which atleast appears to be beneficial, could actually draw someone
out of voluntary work.

it moves on...

Ah., ok.. i get it :) I had an idea that that CA will generate a
key-pair sign it with their pvt-key and give the signed keys to you. I
see I was wrong :)

Darn. That sucks. I totally love DWN. It's the only thing that still 
keeps me informed about what's going on in the Debian world (since I've 
started using Ubuntu mostly). It deserves much more than what Martin is 
asking for.

Well, efforts like Dunc-Tank don't but under-appreciation for someone's 
work does.

Two points that occured to me.

1. You needn't import the TCS CA into your Firefox if the CA public
certificate is signed by one of those who's already present in your
root store. You can have a chain of trust like Verisign->TCS->You.

2. In the proposed system (online tax filing), I imagine the
certificate is used purely to authenticate the user to the server, so
quite likely only the server requires the TCS CA handy.

Hi,

Thanks for reply. But still things are not working.

I just checked things in detail once again and found that Inbound 
traffic is working fine whereas outbound traffic is not working.

Thunderbird: I am able to download emails via SMTP - but i am not able 
to send any emails

GAIM: I am getting messages sent to me - but no one is getting my emails.

What could be the problem?

Is this something related to netmask 255.255.255.255 on ppp0?

Please help.

Thanks
Vinay

I think there is a slight communication problem here. 

Can you please clarify what you mean by "Certifies your identity and attaches it to the key?"

Ok I myself did not know this until recently that PGP web of trust has nothing to do with the hierarchical certification scheme of PKI.

But whatever it is it is all quite complicated.  :)

Most people are tired of certificates and most elaborate parts of PKI.

But certificates are essential for many real world applications, so we cannot ignore them for long.

Ok , there is nothing to feel bad or stupid. Crypto is overly complicated and PKI makes it still more complicated. There are so many things I don't know.

But I will try to clear some of the doubts. 

Most key concepts relating to keys have already been covered.

You generate a keypair, keep the private key safely encrypted with you. Usually private keys are encrypted with a password. It stays with you and never leaves you and you never show it to anyone.

The public key is meant to be public because only if people use your public key to encrypt data you decrypt with your private key. That is how people are supposed to use PKI.

Now , coming to signatures. It is very similar to our hand written signatures.

If you encrypt something with your private key, everybody can decrypt it since what you encrypted can be decrypted with your public key which is known to everyone.

So since only you have your private key, people can know that the message originated from you. And this serves as signature.  Simple, right?

Now, signature is appended to the message. Isn't this the way real world signatures work? So your message in plaintext is digested using MD5 or SHA1 or SHA512 or whatever and the digest is encrypted with your private key.

This encrypted digest is attached to your plaintext message. That is all.

Now let us come to certificates. OMG, now things get really messy.

Certificates are nothing but your public key signed by the private key of the CA. So your public key in plaintext is digested and signed by the private key of the CA and attached to your public key. So this is also easy.

What is the need for this? Why do we need a certificate authority(CA)?

Since public key is anyway public. Why do you want someone to certify it?

This is to avoid tampering since anybody can replace your public key with somebody else's.

That is why you have various identifying information like name, e-mail address blah blah blah based on X.500 directory parameters along with your public key in your certificate.

Ok, till now things are somewhat digestable. 

But certification presents a unique problem. The CA is not universally trusted. So you need several levels of certifications and things start getting really complicated for everyone.

I will give a real life analogy. Let us say a company in US is recruiting you. If you are from say Anna university, that US company may not know Anna university. So if Anna university is recognized by Indian govt. and if US company trusts Indian govt, then they can trust you.

This is a hierarchical real life model translated to virtual world in a straight forward manner by PKI. But there are so many complications I am not getting into. I am frankly not much interested in all those permutation combinations.

PGP has a very different approach towards trust. It argues for a decentralised model in which you determine who to trust and who not to trust. Hence the concept of keyrings.

This makes lot of sense because if you are plotting against a government and talking to your cabal members using encrypted e-mail you can't go by govt. issued certs. :)

It is like keeping a fox in charge of your cattle. 

So in this case, you certify that a particular friend is trusted through an out of band mechanism, say over phone or in person. And you assign a certain trust value between 0 and 4 or something. So you can start people certified by your friend and so on.

I think the difference is somewhat obvious now.

But PGP web of trust is not relevant for situations outside of encrypted e-mail. (It seems to have certain other narrow applications too )

For all practical uses we have to rely on PKI and X.509 certificates.

But the real world crypto use is somewhat cloudy in my brain since I only know the theoretical aspects.

Hence my curiosity on what is going on with digital signatures around. 

Thanks for all the responses.

Girish

But if the browser does not ship with TCS-CA then this does not seem possible. If it is already in the chain, then there is no need to add it either.

This seems logical to me.

But as I told before I don't know about real world needs.

Many thanks. I was only interested in knowing if there is a way.

My preliminary tests at pressing Ctrl-space did not work.

But most likely it is due to my ignorance of the whole thing.

Anyway I shall read about it and let you know how it goes.

This is marvellous news man. I really wonder how I missed all this.

Most definitely I did not look hard enough.

If the details of the protocol are well known, the code is of secondary importance. ;)

What do you mean "better p2p protocols existing today"?

How many are existing?

Mind sharing?

But a lot of efforts have gone into reworking some of the original design deficiencies.

I think one needs to look harder and deeper to figure out more.

As far as I am concerned I will think twice before going for NFS for remote access.

Ah, yes. Why not use a NAS solution instead? What do people use?

What about iSCSI or fibre channel?

I know it is not comparing apples with apples but perhaps this is relevant.

You cannot download e-mails via SMTP. You mean POP3 I suppose. 

If you are not able to send mails there could be many reasons. It is somewhat hard to get this working unlike before since now there is lot of spam control software running everywhere.

I first of all apologize for carelessness on my part. 

I had been tied up with work.

I think Tamil or English is not a big concern. And I also appreciate very much the fact that there are people who can translate stuff. So I think it is a non issue. 

And the point about taking technology to the masses also taken. As far as I am concerned if we enable people to do computing in local languages we can speed up adoption.

Another side effect is that people will develop pride about one's culture and appreciate the fact that there are technologists who care for them.

And it might be a nice way to get people started on to computers and technology and they can pick up English along the way .

So the language issue though very important should not be the fundamental focus of discussion right now.

This is my humble opinion.

First let us focus on getting high quality technical subject matter.

After that grammar, language, translation etc. can be handled. 

And let us take it up slowly. I was thinking of a bimonthly edition. 

What do people think?

Later if it gathers enough momentum we can make it monthly , fortnightly or whatever. But I think only monthly issues will be sustainable in the long run.

I think someone has to take initiative and the "buck should stop there."

Otherwise it will be hard to execute the plan.

I am somewhat unwilling at this point largely because I am yet to keep my promise of the tech talk. I am hoping that I send the slides at least  by Nov 20th. That will give me confidence to take up higher responsibilities.

For now, few people have come forward Parthan, Kenneth and various other folks whose names don't display in my mutt mail client.

And you people have experience in this field. There are so many of us who can write articles but we would not know how to release a magazine.

Any thoughts?

How many volunteers are there?

I think ILUGC has immense potential, both technical and otherwise. 

Releasing a magazine will immensely popularize our cause and also bring about a lot of other nice side effects.

Primarily I have the most selfish motive of bringing about a culture of innovation, creativity and technical excellence in our beautiful country.

If people start writing articles that lot of folks read it will help breed the above qualities.

What say people?

I shall get back with a table of contents or something similar for the first issue sometime soon.

Sorry again for the delay. I was tied up with an immediate deliverable.

I am more than willing to do that. If you help I will give you a treat. :)

What is your name anyway? My mail client cannot display it. 

One another thing I can do is release podcasts in Tamil.

Again I am very scared of my local language skills, whatever it be.

Not only Tamil.

But I am definitely not scared of making mistakes.

So let us begin sometime. Okay? 

First let us get started on the magazine.Then we will move to the next step.

With the above setup, you can have a default route to

/etc/resolv.conf file to your FC1 machine.

You can check your "/sbin/route -n" entry from your
FC3 or FC4 machine.

Parthan,

	Something solid? 

	It is in our hands. Nobody else's.

	If you wish to convert your rich experience into something useful for the larger community and society in general then it is only a matter of volunteering.

	Usually I feel it is the question of "who will bell the cat?"

	Once someone takes initiative others join automatically.

	I can definitely contribute articles on a monthly basis, at least one a month if not more. Now , who is going to handle the logitics?

	There is not much for an online edition.

	Correct me if I am wrong.

	Kenneth,

	Wouldn't a cover art that goes well with the theme 

	and a theme selection do?

	Or is something else required?

	How many articles are required in an issue?

	Cisco's IPJ has only four or five. Why don't we follow that model?

No. Ping is not the only factor.

DNS resolving is also working fine.

In Firefox, whenever i type any URL, i get this in status bar

1) looking for http://www.abc.com
2) connecting
3) connected
4) waiting for reply (and it stops here)

Sorry its POP3.

I am using direct connection to remote server.

Yes. I can login to GAIM (for Yahoo) without problems. I am getting list 
of people online from my friend list. I am also getting messages from 
them - but i am not able to send trhem.

This same setup is working with Reliance Fixed phone dial-up.

Is there anything i am missing?

FYI: This was working well with 750 Plan. This is not working with new 
1500 plan. Is it possible to restrict networking by ISP? or using 
masquerading, we can use any network?

Thanks

That would be nice if it was that way but it doesn't
seem to be the case for TCS or any other CA in India.

Have a look at this
On TCS's certificate chain
http://www.tcs-ca.tcs.co.in/index.jsp?leftHtml=html/chainleft.html&rightHtml=html/chain.html&leftTitle=Repository&right1stLink=cert_chain&right1stTitle=Certificate%20Chain&right2ndTitle=Repository&highlight=0

and on  Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA), in
India
http://www.cca.gov.in/

It says-"CCA at the root of the trust chain in India."

and I can't find the CCA's certificate on my firefox
browser.

Sarad.

It needn't be present. Assuming the above
Verisign->TCS->https://mysite.com chain of trust, if you visit
https://mysite.com, you are presented with mysite.com's certificate
signed by TCS, and TCS's public key signed by Verisign. So long as the
browser has Verisign's public key handy, it can verify
https://mysite.com to whatever extend of trust the user is willing to
place on the site.

Amit,

	I think Kenneth will take charge as he has prior experience doing exactly what we plan to do. :)

Amit,

	If we get the online version right, it means a lot.

	Let me try to explain. I may be wrong but this is what I think is the way things work.

	We can register a domain for the magazine and release high quality articles. We can aggressively seek advertisers and use Google's Ad Sense. Over time, say 6 months we can get thoroughly entrenched and ad revenue will become something like a constant revenue stream.

	And of course if we give practical solutions then people will get back to us with consulting assignments which can be delegated if we are busy.

	I see a lot of potential.

	I think technically creating a print version is more or less easy.

	But where will the money come from? :)

	The fact that Anantharaman Mani consented to arrange a 220 ppl capacity hall for my talk itself speaks enough about the potential of ILUGC.

	There are really powerful people out there.

	I really don't think money will be an issue here.

	Provided we get the excellence part right.

	Any thoughts?

regards,
Girish

Think of it as the electronic equivalent of getting photostatic copies
of your certificates attested by a gazetted officer. The officer
certifies the copy as a true one and attaches his signature/office
seal to the document.

I see.. This detail was missing before. Now there seems to be some hope.

I think your network is screwed up mostly because of some masquerading/firewalling rule which you have got wrong.

I have zero experience with iptables. So I cannot help. Sorry.

What remote server? Then it is not spam issue. Are you able to get a prompt  on telnet remoteserver 25?

This does not make sense to me. If you can login, it means your credentials are sent across. Then why you are not able to send messages?

I think it might be a low level MTU issue. I only faced a problem like this when I set the MTU smaller than the layer 2 size.

It is a puzzle to me as much as to you. 

Lot of things are possible in networking. :)

But something tells me the problem is at your side and not at the side of the ISP.

As I guessed it is a terminology problem. All signatures are attached.

So without attaching the signature of the CA, a certificate is no certificate. So what is attached is the signature of the CA and not the key.

I think my previous mail talks about this.

Ok I will clarify one thing. 

I can do lot of backend work but frontending someone else has to do.

As I have told already though I appreciate your enthusiasm my mind will not be easy till we get the technical part right.

Hence my Tamil writing skills will have to wait till we get the subject matter right.

Ok let me try to think aloud about the whole affair. 

I am afraid I have to leave the browser alone since my experience has been theoretical.

If I understand things correctly there are two directions in which traversal happens in a certificate chain. Either from the root CA level , you traverse down the hierarchy to fish out a particular certificate with a certain subject or you start from a leaf node, say a user's certificate and you traverse up until you hit a node that is trusted by the other party.

Most of the time the traversal is done from the leaf node upwards.

For instance, take the case of 

A -> B -> C -> D

A issues a cert to B which issues one to C which issues one to D.

Now D is authenticating against a public server. If the server does not have any of the certificates A,B or C in his list of trusted certs, then D is rejected. 

Now coming back to our discussion.

To have 

Verisign->TCS->mysite.com list of certificates with you, you should first import the TCS certificate into your browser right?

Or am I missing something?

I positively admit a lack of clarity as this is something I should most certainly know but don't. :(

Yes. The fact that mysite.com presents to the user, its own
certificate signed by TCS, and TCS's signing certificate signed by
Verisign. So, TCS's signing certificate needn't be "imported" into the
browser (importing is basically just ensuring you have a local copy of
TCS's signing certificate).

Why not, if the certificate is downloaded from an authenticated host?

True, the world is becoming more and more insecure and people are
exploring new ways to keep things secure. Here is a list (search for
'List of Certificate Uses')
ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2692.txt

- Mac OS X uses certificates to verify updates of important components.
- Windows 2K and later use certificates to verify drivers.

Hi girish !
Well Perhaps I could not agree more. The ideas seem to be pretty good
and perhaps a practically succeeding idea. 

So how do we get started ?What about the domain registration we also
need to zero in on a few things which are 

1. people who will be the "artists"?
2. people who will be the "writers"?
3. the managers ?

The Information Technology Act, 2000, was enacted to provide legal 
recognition for transactions carried out electronically, and is based on 
the United Nations model law adopted by UNCITRAL, in 1997, and is fairly 
uniform across the world.   The basic idea is to provide alternatives to 
paper based methods of communication and storage of information. 

MCA 21 of the Ministry of Company Affairs is a major initiative in India 
to make active use of the enactment. Please visit http://www.mca.gov.in/ 
for information and details on where and how it has use and application. 
http://www.mca.gov.in/MinistryWebsite/dca/dsc/certifying-new.html gives 
market details for Digital Signature Certificates. The handbook for 
using digital signatures is at:
http://www2.mca.gov.in/MinistryWebsite/dca/help/ProcessHandbook.pdf

Users need to exercise great caution in using these facilities, and the 
pitfalls are listed at:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_certificate
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_third_party

It should be noted that the CA is doing nothing more than attesting your 
identity.  The above link says:

<quote>
How to arrange for (trustable) third parties of this type is an unsolved 
problem. So long as there are motives of greed, politics, revenge, etc, 
those who perform (or supervise) work done by such an entity will 
provide potential loopholes through which the necessary trust may leak. 
The problem, perhaps an unsolvable one, is ancient and notorious. That 
large impersonal corporations make promises of accuracy in their 
attestations of the correctness of a claimed public key \leftrightarrow 
user correspondence (eg, by a certificate authority 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority> as a part of a 
public key infrastructure 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure>) changes little.
</quote>

AFAIK, the age old tradition of building trust with personal contact is 
the only real way to ensure trust, and the only security that is known 
and proved to work well is that of openness and publicity.

Our Supreme Court had the occasion in Naresh v. State of Maharashtra 
[AIR 1967 SC 1] to consider the merits of open and public trials for 
"healthy objective and fair administration of justice," and quoted 
Bentham with approval as follows:

     "In the darkness of secrecy, sinister interest, and evil in every 
    shape, have full swing. ... Publicity is the very soul of justice. 
    It is the keenest spur to exertion, and the surest of all guards 
    against improbity. It keeps the Judge himself while trying under 
    trial in the sense that the security of securities is publicity."

The principles laid are equally true for filings or transactions that 
are public in nature.  It is easy to see that the greatest danger comes 
from the obligation to keep your private key a secret or make sure that 
only you can use your digital signature certificate.  On the contrary, 
merely publishing filings online (albeit without any complicated 
encryption or digital signature, in just plain text) offers maximum 
security, in that, anyone who sees something going wrong merely has to 
raise hue and cry with the truth, and does not have to investigate how 
and where his secrets were compromised.  A simple login id with password 
should work fine in a world where people are straightforward and honest.

The bottom line is that the digital signature certificate is just a 
complicated method to get a login, and the usual precautions taken with 
passwords apply.

Sarad is right. There is a lot of slip between the cup and the lip.

Recently my cousin's yahoo! account was broken into and the attacker spent mney thro' his Paypal account.

My cousin used a very strong password. Still this happened.

It is very hard to analyze the security properties of an architecture.

And real life bugs and implementation slackness makes things much worse than we can imagine.

Being paranoid is the norm rather than the exception for security engineers.

So Sarad is on the dot.

Wait Binand. This is getting a bit above my head. Let us start from first principles.

Always in any authentication setup, there is a "supplicant" and a "verifier."

In the real world, when I produce my ration card to the gas company(Dammit, I can't get a new cylinder now since I dont have a ration card), I am the supplicant and the gas company is the verifier.

This is when certificates  are used for authentication. Certificates are mainly used for this though it is also used for exchanging keys since the certificate contains the public using which anyone can communicate securely with you. 

Now, there are two cases.
  
  a) User authenticates to server
  b) Server authenticates to user

Okay?

Now, let us begin.

It is always the supplicant or the party who wants to prove his/her authenticity that presents a certificate/certificate chain. The verifier looks for someone whom he trusts amongst the list of certificates in the chain. The use can alternately specify multiple distinct certificate chains also.

This is like I produce a US college certificate and an Indian degree to a European company. I don't know who they trust more.

So to summarize when the user authenticates to server, user presents the chain.

Usually user authenticates using password. 

When the server authenticates to user(this is the common scenario), When you click "Accept certificate" that is what you are doing. Since if the server is masqueraded then you end up revealing your password and other credentials and the disaster that happened with my cousin recently might happen to you too. (He lost around 500$ thro' paypal as his yahoo! acct got broken into,but I hear paypal has refunded it).

So we have to identify which of the two is happening here.

We import different certificates into the browser to add it to our trust store. This will be useful to use only when we are the verifier and not when we are the supplicant. Does this make sense?

Because just by importing a certificate we cannot create a certificate chain. If our certificate is signed by TCS-CA. Then the chain exists automatically since who all have certified TCS-CA is neither our concern nor do we have to worry about it.

So that chain is built automatically without our doing anything.

I now understand very clearly what you are saying. I think everyone can easily get it now.

That we need to import only root CAs into our browser.

So if TCS-CA is root CA we import. Otherwise there is no need since the particular case that you mention or when there are 100 certificates between Verisign and TCS-CA will all work without our having to import anything.

OMG, this was such a simple idea, wonder why I missed it all along.

So now comes the question, is TCS-CA the root CA?

Girish

Wait man. Rome was not built in a day. :)

I am still thinking hard whether we should make it quarterly like Cisco IPJ or bimonthly. Monthly is out of question.

What "managers"? You don't want me started on how much I hate corporates, do you? :)

You need one guy ( Editor)  who is responsible for kicking the butts of others to get people to write articles. And he should mentor them, hand hold, criticize them, call them up at 2:00 am at night etc. to ensure that he gets good quality articles.

The editor will also write editorials in the first page which usually makes very interesting reading in most magazines. :)

And he has to take the final decision after getting inputs from all of us as to what the theme of each issue will be. I think linuxjournal decides this well in advance.

Then he has to coordinate getting art work done, and getting articles on time.

Plain and simple. 

We need a guy of high standing, seniority and respected in our community.

What better choice than Kenneth? :)

Or Raman? 

I want someone older than we kids. :)

To begin with I can identify one bakra at least. 

Ramkumar, can you promise an article on zsh for the first issue? :)

You get the distinction of being the first bakra for our magazine.

Also we need a catchy name for the magazine.

Suggestions please. And a logo.

I don't like a "Westernised" name.

It should sound distinctly Indian. At the same time it should not have any regional/cultural/ethnic overtones.

Other thoughts I have are 

  a) We need a theme for each issue. Suggestions please. Examples are virtualization, embedded systems, localization and linux, relevance of open source for a developing nations etc...

  b) I think each issue should have a
       *)cookbook style article say "Instructions on setting up an Internet based radio station with Ubuntu"

       *)tutorial style article on a difficult topic, say crypto, networking, or various different narrow areas like ATMEL AVR interfacing with linux

       *)FAQ that can easily be condensed from our day to day discussions

       *)cool tricks which again can be easily fished from the list

I think you can clearly see how easy the whole affair is. :)

I promise to send an article on "Setting up a robust e-mailing system" for the first issue.

Thanks.

Girish

What does the above statement mean? I wonder.

Is that so? Then how come Sanjay Dutt and Salman Khan are roaming about scot free? And Sidhu?

And poor people who have nobody to argue their case being incarcerated illeglly?

In all cultures and at all times, clout has mattered much more than everything else. :)

This is true even in America and elsewhere.

I get your point that the press should be open and democratic and that by bringing things to light people will be scared to do wrong things but it is not a panacea against all crime.

I agree PKI is overly complicated. I don't think the term "digital signature certificate" is correct never mind if it used in official technical documentation.

Signatures and certificates are closely related and you can't have one without the other but at the same time they are distinct. So you either have a
certificate or a digital signature.

Anyway I am not too bothered about superficial things.

I don't understand your argument above. What are you trying to say?

I think real world and digital world are more or less equivalent in the sense that instead of keeping your license or house key safe, you have to now keep your private key safely.

And like reading what you are attesting before signing you know what you are doing when using digital signatures.

But there is much more room for fraud and things going wrong in the digital world because there can be trapdoors, Trojan horses, viruses etc...

Which means that people should start using open source solutions to minimize this. :)

Thanks for your detailed mail. I don't mean to pick at you, just some sincere queries and concerns, that is all.

Girish

What do you get for 'iptables -t nat -L', 'iptables -t mangle -L' and

Hmm., a SAN is completely different from a NAS box.

My idea is to make a world class Indian technical magazine.

And I have the ulterior motive of kicking the butt of ***.

So a Tamil "only" magazine does not fit in. Does it?

As I already mentioned language is beside the point.

I will try asking the bsd-india@ to see if there is some traction there.

I want to stop the hegemony and high handedness of *** and at the same time also bring about the jewels in you people in a manner that all can see and appreciate.

I wonder why you guys are going in the language track. 

It is defeatist I tell you. If you want to serve the Tamil cause then develop localized software or still better make devices that talk and understand Tamil.

If you want to reach the masses through Tamil, then an English magazine that is translated perfectly into Tamil will do that much much better than a Tamil only magazine.

Think about it. 

What I am saying might sound counter intuitive but it is true.

It is better to welcome comments, criticism and reviews from a much larger audience instead of locking it in Tamil language whereby you are restricting your canvas.

This positively reeks of misguided values.

We are losing ourselves in some sort of defeatist ideology instead of serving the goal and practical purpose of breeding excellence and taking technology to the masses.

My Thoughts,

* My vote goes for a Tamil Magazine, as there are lots of English 
magazines available.
* I will say, start small, work more, make big. Concentrating too much 
on printing, selling and other commercial aspects can be placed at the 
sides and let us ponder about the content
* The content of the proposed magazine depends upon the intended 
audience of the magazine. If the intended audience is common or low 
level thechies, then no use in putting up geeky stuff.
* I favor individual sections on hot news, for the beginners, power 
users, happenings around, new releases and hot apps. May be a few other 
sections will do end in a decent magazine.
* Think, for the initial stages a wiki will do good. Lets put up 
articles there and editing be done on them. lets there be a dead end for 
the articles to be put up and get edited. The team lead / editor then 
selects articles from these collections and prepares the new issue.

Hope we start working soon, we have another 20 days left to bring our 
first issue December 1st :)

Dear friends,

I am not having any problem when installing a  package like moodle,sugarcrm
in my lamp stack when it was with PHP 5.1, but porting the application in
php 5.2 i am having the following error,

Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class DateTime in

After googling, I couldnt find any relevant patches. I have found a patch at
http://forums.vtiger.com/viewtopic.php?p=37631 but i am not sure this will
patch my app because the said patch is only for vtiger,

Should i downgrade my php5.2 to 5.1 or is there is any fix for
it.Anypointer is much appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Parthan, Lets not hurry. Please. Identify persons resposible. Look, we
started FOSS for my Lang group if you remember and seldom some posts there.

Thai piranthal Vazhi pirakkum. We will make good ground work. We will ask
writers like Sujatha also. We will have team to work on Latex. We will
identify a Editor. Sub-Editor... Technical Group all set up.

Let the first release be on January 14, The Thamizhar Thiru Naal. :-)

Gisrish says,
My idea is to make a world class Indian technical magazine. 

And I have the ulterior motive of kicking the butt of ***. 

So a Tamil "only" magazine does not fit in. Does it? 

As I already mentioned language is beside the point. 

I will try asking the bsd-india@ to see if there is some traction there. 

I want to stop the hegemony and high handedness of *** and at the same time also bring about the jewels in you people in a manner that all can see and appreciate. 

I wonder why you guys are going in the language track. 

It is defeatist I tell you. If you want to serve the Tamil cause then develop localized software or still better make devices that talk and understand Tamil. 

If you want to reach the masses through Tamil, then an English magazine that is translated perfectly into Tamil will do that much much better than a Tamil only magazine. 

Think about it. 

What I am saying might sound counter intuitive but it is true. 

It is better to welcome comments, criticism and reviews from a much larger audience instead of locking it in Tamil language whereby you are restricting your canvas. 

This positively reeks of misguided values. 

We are losing ourselves in some sort of defeatist ideology instead of serving the goal and practical purpose of breeding excellence and taking technology to the masses.

Girish

My Thoughts, 

* My vote goes for a Tamil Magazine, as there are lots of English 
magazines available. 
* I will say, start small, work more, make big. Concentrating too much 
on printing, selling and other commercial aspects can be placed at the 
sides and let us ponder about the content 
* The content of the proposed magazine depends upon the intended 
audience of the magazine. If the intended audience is common or low 
level thechies, then no use in putting up geeky stuff. 
* I favor individual sections on hot news, for the beginners, power 
users, happenings around, new releases and hot apps. May be a few other 
sections will do end in a decent magazine. 
* Think, for the initial stages a wiki will do good. Lets put up 
articles there and editing be done on them. lets there be a dead end for 
the articles to be put up and get edited. The team lead / editor then 
selects articles from these collections and prepares the new issue. 

Hope we start working soon, we have another 20 days left to bring our 
first issue December 1st :)

My thoughts 

well a Tamil only magazine will actually limit the participation  both from the authors and the readers. I am a bengali and i dont know tamil. so i do not have any means by which i could contribute to the mag for instance.

So perhaps griish's suggestion that we could have a English mag and a Tamil translation does hold more promise .

The problem is that there is already a glut of magazines in English.

However, the problem with bringing out this magazine only in Tamil and
getting authors to contribute in Tamil will be that it will severely limit
the number of people who can contribute towards it. The vast majority of
the good technical content out there is in English and most authors are
probably more conversant in English than in Tamil.

Having said that, I think there is a need for good technical documentation
in vernacular languages including Tamil.

A lot of people from the villages and small towns may be good programmers,
but their inability to communicate very well in English, or even
understand technical documentation in English, limits their ability to
gain skills and that is a shame. I faced this problem with someone who I
was trying to train to program. I personally taught some of the basic
computer skills, but for this person to advance in skills, he must be able
to read documentation available in the web, get good books on the subject
etc. However, since all of that was missing, he was having real problems
improving his skills.

If there are enough people willing to translate documentation from the web
- it may be stuff from the PHP docs, the Java docs etc, and then place
them online, then it will definitely be useful.

Also, if authors can send in articles in english and have that translated
into Tamil for inclusion into the magazine, it will be great.

And thirdly, if existing applications can be translated into Tamil and
included into CDs sold along with the magazine, or made available for
download, it will benefit a lot of people.

So in a sense, you need the following workflows:

Foreign language authors -> Translators -> Print / Web
Foreign language documents -> Translators -> Print / Web
Foreign language apps -> Translators -> Programmers -> Web / CD

Thanks,
PK

Bleh, its not hurrying ! Hit the iron when its hot. I have seen so many 
things which all starts (mean the talking part) in high adrenalin mode 
but fades off with time. So, its better to work than to keep talking. 
Once we show something physical, i.e. a magazine (how ever small it 
might be), more people will realize we are indeed doing some thing and 
will join.

foss4mylang was started but now it is inactive, i agree. But, if we 
organize another workshop like that day, we may do some useful work as 
we did that day.

I hope we are FOSS people. Do we need to have hierarchies like editor, 
sub-editor, proof reader, etc. defined to start working ? My idea is 
every one should contribute freely, every one should be able to edit 
freely, so as to make the articles of better quality. I agree we need a 
editor, but it can be editor(s) too.

January 14th is well far off, what are we going to do till then ? Keep 
talking about what and how we are going to do ? Our ideas/enthusiasm are 
shining like a sun now, make hay before the night conquers!

Lets stop first stage discussions here and move on. Those who want to 
write articles in english do write, so that translation can be done. We 
will think about "English Vs Tamil" a bit later. Contributions should 
begin soon :) (I have started thinking about it)

The Motto here is to develop the art of Techinical Writing in Indian
Languages. Since we speak Tamil, we took Tamil.

Its equallay appreciable to start a Bengali edition if you could form a
Team. Begali people should get the techinical resources in Bengali for sure.
A Land of Tagore and Vivekananda! And Maharishi Arabindo and Nethaji.... It
would be gr8 if you could make the intiative to start a Bengali edition.

The technology of creating magazine is going to be common... on which we can
work together.. and the medium of communication between us can either be
Hindi/ English.

Translation kills native thinking. It will end up in Hollywood movies
translated to Tamil/ Bengali etc., Or a Cartoon n/w program translated to
native Languages.

The originality of each language will be Lost. The motto is to express the
concepts in mind in one's own mother tongue. May it be Bengali or tamil.

Have you read the India today's Tamil editorial translations... Oooof...
Nativity at total Loss! Rather look at any other Magazine like Kalki or
Kumudam (not Off late)... Thats what is being spoken here...

authors in english should take the trouble to get their articles  
translated - which means they should find a translator and keep  
poking him until it is translated (some money needs to be spent on  
beer). Also those who know tamil should take the trouble to learn to  
read and write - it is not that hard. And tamil keyboard entry can be  
learnt in 15 minutes max

I had suggested *"Thoothu"* as second part. I will suggest some good word

"Thoothu Po Sellakiliye" is some kind of common word around...

Some creative cartoon of a *"Parrot"* can be the Logo. "*Pachaikili" *is how
we call parrot.

*"Pacchu" *we can call our Logo.

Suggestions?

That idea did cross my mind. I have far more hope from Tamil and Bengali cultures than any other.

I definitely don't mean to offend anyone but culturally speaking our nation has benefitted the most by these two cultures.

Gigantic world moving personalities were born here.

But then there are so many other great men born in so many other places too. :) What about Gandhi eh?

The West does not recognize anyone as much him, do you know?

And the language forms an essential part of both sensibilities.

At the same time one should not be narrow minded and dogmatic and look down upon others.

There are close to 800 dialects/languages. What is important is nationalist ideals and if possible even global ideals but with a strict local context.

We definitely do not want fanaticism in the name of language.

We already have enough in the name of caste and religion.

I did think long and deep about this.

I disagree. 

Movies and cartoons are a work of art. Technology is black and white like mathematics.

And guess what , I really don't believe in a separate solution for developing and poor nations.

Today India's economy is so good that a computer is definitely within the reach of most educated public.

This is the reason I am advocating for an English base.

Dammit, who the hell is gonna pay for vernacular tech journals?

And how long are you going to motivate people with ideals and cultural bullshit?

You need hard cash, money to motivate excellence.

I wonder why the stupid corporate world in India has not got this idea in spite of playing the game for 6 decades.

That there is plenty of money in excellence.

Mark my words. I cannot support any initiative in which there is even a slightest chance of getting a feeling of "inferiority" or "weakness".

People dread world classness in India as though it is some sort of demon that is going to swallow you.

I KNOW as opposed to think that Indian technical talent is world class.

(Have you read other worldwide mailing lists like freebsd-questions@?)

I just want it to come out in the open so the world takes notice.

Long long ago Swami Vivekananda quite clearly expressed this fact.

If at all there is any hope for India it is only in opening up to the advanced, economic giants, the West.

Otherwise we cannot sustain for long.

Today all that is happening, be it call centers or IT industry or whatever is thanks to Western wealth.

Let us not forget that.

That also is a healthy ecosystem in which there is free flow of ideas, money and what not.

Let us not lock up ourselves in mediocrity by thinking local.

Think global, but act locally.

How will you express "virtualization" in Tamil or Bengali? Or Sanskrit?

Just think. You will get what I mean, not too hard.
>

I know that the media in Tamil Nadu and Kerala are really sound and advanced.

It even beats the Western media. There is far less gossip here.

But then, India Today might not be a good example.

All this is happening due to the politics, "this is enough" thinking that has taken over our race.

Pity!

Let us understand and appreciate the importance of money first.

If you pay people well they do world class stuff.

And that of thinking big as Amit said. It is not thinking big.

How big? :)

It is thinking "world class excellence".

My usual disclaimer.

I only want to help. Never hurt anyone.

If you find something wrong, please forgive. :)

Yes i a agree with u. It should not be "tamil only" magazine, which kills appreciation from other users who are non-tamilians across the country/nations.
One needs to agree that the defacto universal language for communication across nations is English. so coexistence of tamil and english versions is most preferrable.
Pls note that almost all the people who are into linux are aware of english, not tamil. lets keep the motive of educating masses abt linux as top proiroty and eliminate lingustic chauvanism. -- let it be an "open magazine" with respect to natural languages.

Who says so?

There is a lot of glut in software too.

There is only one open source print magazine called linuxjournal.

No other. Not even one for BSDs. You call it glut?

There are plenty for perl, this and that. But none of the same class and calibre of linuxjournal.

My idea is to compete with the only open source tech journal in India.

Where is the glut? Am I missing something?

What have people with all the benefit of convent education and top notch engineering colleges done for India?

I don't mean to naysay or anything.

But the other day a call taxi driver was telling this.

"Thamizha vechundu mavarakka than mudiyum."

I felt insulted of course. But what to do?

That was his perspective and one has to respect it.

We should help people gain strength, not weaken them. In all the discussions this should be key.

If your idea is to take technology to the masses, remember that you also have to bring them towards technology.

I feel reminded of the relevant Tirukural here.

"Solluthal yarkum eliya ariavam,
	solliya vannam seyal."

It is all easy to talk, but how will you sustain a low end magazine meant for the poor in the long run?

Is any NGO gonna come forward?

At least will you survive till then?

Anyway I am not a heartless techie only focused on excellence.

If there is enough business and money in the game, I am willing to do service. And help less fortunate folks.

There is a saying in Hindi.

"Pehle ghar mein diya jalao, phir mandir mein."

First light the lamp at home, then worry about lighting it in the temple.

Really beautiful, isn't it?

So profound. 

First tell me where the money will come from. Then talk of charity.

It should not become a low end transliteration shop. :)

So far of all mails received I think this has been most practical.

there is no linguistic chauvinism here - and please dont introduce  
any. The masses speak tamil in tamilnadu and read and write that. So  
education of them needs to be in tamil. There is absolutely no  
shortage of matter in english to educate those who know/want english.  
I strongly resent the idea that we are suggesting this due to  
chauvinism - tamil is not my mother tongue, nor is it my second  
language. In fact it is my third language if anything. But in  
tamilnadu we need to do it in tamil to fill a void.

Say using images, libraries or creating graphics and such stuff.

Perhaps a good primer on TeX to go with it?

A tool based approach and also a typesetting one.

If no one comes forward you will have to wait till I study all this.

A NAS makes a filesystem available over the network on which client machines
can read and write. The linux admin handbook says its just a fancy name for
a file server! A SAN makes block devices available over the network. Client
machines can create their own filesystems on this.

Using GNBD one can make thier hdd available as a block device over the
network. Check out RedHat documentation on this.

It is tough. not gonna happen overnight. I agree.

It has to evolve. Just a beginning :-)

All that I said about Tamil Magazines etc., are just examples to complement
my suggestions and feedback.. Kenneth got the right section of my
intention..

*"The motto is to express the concepts in mind in one's own mother tongue.
May it be Bengali or Tamil." *

I maight have suggested irrelevant examples to complement my ideas. But the
whole intention of previous mail is above.

This problem can happen when the said class is already defined. What
could cause this 'DateTime' to be already defined? I think it could be
that DateTime is now part of php 5.2 and yes it is...
http://at.php.net/releases/5_2_0.php

So you need to remove DateTime from your stack and it should work.

it need not be ones mother tongue.
Well i meant the magazine shouldnot be limited to tamil and tamilnadu alone. minimal english knowledge is necessary  (to understand documentation) even if the user doesnt know perfect english, but to understand linux concepts. i dont think people who donot know english at all show much interest towards learning linux.
I am sorry that  one is talking abt educating masses in tamilnadu alone ??? how can it be world class then ? u need a common language medium to share knowledge.
i hope that should be a nationalistic agenda. lets not narrow down knwoledge to one language. I hope it should be primarily be in english and translated to tamil and slowly people working together for porting it to other languages too.

KM

who is talking about tamilnadu alone? if we show it can be done in  
tamil successfuly, then other languages can follow - it is easier to  
translate from tamil to kannada, malayalam and telugu than to  
translate from english to those languages. Also it looks like we may  
have a few articles in urdu also for the mag ;-)

Is Tamilnadu not part of the World. I do not know what u mean by world class
here. Please define. Common Language indeed is needed, when people meet some
who do not speak his/ her language. But,

Please under stand Tamil is not sopken by some 1000 people. It is spoken by
70 million across globe. Equal stanza stands good for all Indian Language.

There is ample difference between Medium of Instruction and Medium of
Communication...

I equally request you to think of such idea of bringing a magazine in your
mother Tongue. It is not Chavunism. We are indeed Bharathians. No doubt.

Oh.. Think of the time it will take for this entire 70 million to learn
English first and then Learn Linux.

I know English and I know Tamil. I know ten kids who do not English. I want
to teach them Linux. The best way is to teach them in their Language. Isn't
that simple!

No doubt (as far as IT filed and few other fields are concerned) but this
needs a seperate thread for discussion. Also, Oct 21 dated International
Business Week speaks about "Karma Capitalism". Our Karma Theory of Economy
is being slowly adopted by Western World. Unfortunate that we do not realise
our own importance. Either refer to that or refer to this week's Thuglak, an
article by S Gurumurthy.

Microsoft's way is the best way to make money. They themselves are standing
examples. :-)

No,

its IDE HDD only.
the ERROR says to append a correct "root=" boot option, so i tried to give
the kernel argument while booting as ,
: linux root=/dev/hdc
because my CD ROM was a secondary Master. it passed that line ,but after
that it throws a different error.
No init found try passing init= option to kernel.

please guide me to find out where the problem is. thanks in advance.

GPL is a copyright license generally applied to software and not 
documentation. If you would like to disown all copyrights you can put it 
under public domain though I wouldnt recommend that. The better option 
would be the OPL license without the optional restrictive clauses or the 
creative commons attribute share alike license. The OPL license has a 
advantage of a proper no warranty provision which is useful if you 
target a litigation happy place like US.

GPL is for software - we need a creative commons license. Further  
both GPL and creative commons respect copyright - copyright will  
always belong to the author/authors.

Sorry, I was referring to GNU FDL (Free Doc License) - copyleft
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html

Which one? Creative Commons or GNU FDL?

Message-ID: <455472D0.7030501@gmail.com>

Hello,

I installed the Xen hypervisor kernel
(xen-image-xen0-2.6.17-6-generic-xen0) from the Ubuntu repositories. I
am using edgy on my PC. Some of my hardware setting are here:
http://pastebin.ca/244948

I am able to work fine from the stock kernel. However, when I boot into
the Xen enabled kernel, I am unable to ping any website. Any one know
any reasons?

Is there already a linux install on that machine (possibly with a

Got it. If your focus is to develop the best opensource mag, then please
do ignore my last comments on creating a magazine in Tamil summarized by
the following workflows that I suggested:

> Foreign language authors -> Translators -> Print / Web
> Foreign language documents -> Translators -> Print / Web
> Foreign language apps -> Translators -> Programmers -> Web / CD

I agree with you that the quality of magazines out there is too poor. If
you are going to be creating a new magazine, you have the choice of:

a) Targetting the low-end in which case you could fill your magazine with
advertisements, comparison of hardware, a few token sections with software
reviews, some language tutorial thrown in etc.

b) Target the high end and really go for the meaty subjects. Discuss
issues such as standardization, discuss the kernel.. That is more in-depth
article, and less hype/hoopla/product-reviews kinda like Byte.

Ofcourse, if you want to create the *best* open source mag out there, you
must go with (b) and not (a). Actually, I would love a magazine like that
and I would happily buy it and recommend it to others.

If would highly recommend that for a start:

a) Avoid going the print route as the logistically it is far more of a
challenge than doing a web-only version or even a PDF version.

b) Keep the graphics small, and the content big. :) So you can spend less
time trying to figure out how to do the graphics and more time creating
the great articles :)!

Anyway, you have my support and the first subscription.

Thanks,
PK

But isn't this so-called "Karma Capitalism" just simply a new fangled term
coined for something which everyone has known for eons - that companies
can earn money and also help society? What is new about that? and what
makes you think the rest of the world was ignorant of this till now?

Also, isn't this the same S. Gurumurthy who said that we can bring down
the cost of petrol by just increasing the value of the rupee such that it
becomes 23 rupees against a dollar?!!  I have a hard time taking anything
this guy says seriously.

On the contrary, most coding standards ask developers not to assume that 
the default language used would be English. 

And, one speciality of the Tamil language is that it could stand alone, 
without support from any other  language.   The Tamil grammarians were 
very well versed in both Sanskrit and Tamil, but deliberately chose to 
keep Tamil pure in line with its ancient traditions.  Kambar translated 
Ramayan from Sanskrit to Tamil, but did not use Sanskrit words anywhere 
in his translation. "Tamil only" works would be most welcome and true to 
the spirit and culture of the language.

Tamil has two grammars - the high and the low.  The low is called 
"kodunthamiz" - or the common dialect and is generally liberal in 
allowing imports from other languages. Hurricane, TV, cinema, KD are all 
part of the Tamil dialect.  It would do no harm if words like 
"virtualisation" are simply imported without any translation too for 
purposes of the common dialect.  Of course, that would never be 
acceptable in the high and poetic sen Tamil.

Computer programs are treated just like literary works, and there is no 
harm in releasing documentation or other literary works under the GPL.

The GPL is much less complicated than most other options.  Further, 
ideally, the code should be self documenting, in which case the GPL 
would automatically cover the documentation too.  Take for instance the 
documentation generated with help from doxygen - there is absolutely no 
need to invent or use a different license for the documentation.

kdict and stardict have very nice dictionaries - about a dozen including 
gcide, wordnet, oed, collins, etc that give English to English meanings, 
and also English to other languages such as Sanskrit and Hindi (the 
Monier Williams English to Sanskrit, and the freedict eng-hin dict). I 
do not find a suitable English to Tamil or vice versa dict. I hope Hari, 
Sri Ramadoss, and others could find a way to release some usable 
dictionary with help of the translations already available.

Tamil, Sanskrit and most Indian languages have strong root words, and 
so, it should be fairly easy to find suitable translations. 
Virtualisation merely has something to do around jumping from one system 
to another, and and I could suggest thavu-sakthi-palam (all the three 
words have the same meaning too!).

For anyone interested in finding the appropriate Hindi translation for 
"vitualisation", here is a snip from kdict:

Hi,

Would like to hear from experts the relationship between Keyborad Layout -
Fonts - Input Methods and Encoding Standards.

Say we have Remington Keyboard Layout, Phonetic Keyboard Layout...

Fonts we have Unicode... and other types too...

Encoding UTF-8, UTF-16 etc.,

Input methods - SCIM, XIM etc.,

What are these? How are they inter-related?

That depends on the context. GPL clause 2.a requires that each revision 
be identified uniquely. When applied to code, this requirement is easily 
satisfied by using a source code management tool but for other creative 
works, the use of a SCM is not as much a common practice.
If documentation source format is different from the published format 
which is the case for docbook generated documentation for example, GPL 
clause 3 might add unnecessary complications.

For fonts, the use of GPL might have unintended consequences.

For reciprocal licenses that is generally correct but creative commons 
set of licenses have "human readable" versions which makes this process 
much more understandable. OPL is not complex either.

Thats true for documentation associated with code. Not a magazine.

Subject: [Ilugc] Can you suggest some idea for small project
Message-ID: <20061110140942.45529.qmail@web36808.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello everyone.
   
  I am a newbie to Linux development and I am looking for a small project. 
   
  I have a done a reasonable amount Windows development (Applications, Windows Services, Libraries, Games) using languages like C,C++,Java and more recently C#. But I would like to start developing in linux. I already have very basic knowledge of networking, databases(MySQL), threads, processes, gui designn ( GTK+, GLADE ) and some other stuff in linux ( Note that i am saying very basic ). Can you guys suggest me some good project  to start with.
  I am willing to give 4-5 hours for about 2-3 weeks to the project. If required then I am willing to learn some other stuff for the project.
   
  I must tell you that this project is not for my college. I want do this just to gain some linux development experience. Although If possible then I would like to submit it to fedora extras.
   
  Thanks a lot.

Well ! gone are the days in which literature flourished in ancient India, far different from todays. that time we had universities to educate people in vedic studies who used to come from other countries, but now we are in the other corner. anycase, i dont think its good to have "only tamil" magazine. be in touch with the world thru a common language - English. Its better to first implement it in english - watch out how it goes - then think of translating into vernacular languages.

Pls note that, Samskritam was a scholarly language in ancient times. common people used to converse in Prakrit. also worth mention is that even the westeners recognize the unparalleled clarity of grammatical syntax and power of expression in samskritam. No other grammarian is compared as tall as panini at the design of samskritam grammar. Samskritam was also dubbed the best suitable language for use in programming amongst all natural languages known todate (read an article sometime back).

That doesnt mean that one should start magazine in samskritam. so be practical!
one can - but after establishing it in english.

It is not going to be a translation to native language. Making of a magazine
in native language.

One of our friend Kapilan, suggested a classic difference between
Translation and Original making.

The word "Water Falls".. How do you translate? Neer Veezchi? This is
translation. What is the originality ? It is "Aruvi"

I think we have enough topic to be covered independently in a native
language magazine alone. These are specific to Tamil alone. Let me site very
basic few...

1) Keyboard Layouts
2) Encoding
3) Translator Tools - KBabel etc.,
4) Fonts
5) Input methods - SCIM etc.,

These are just to begin.. We have all these to cover.. How come these things
be covered in a English Magazine...

Well interested few can indeed start English Magazine.. And the technology
used for making magazine can be made common....

But Tamil Magazine should not be a translated version of that... It has to
deal with Tamil specific technical/ non-technical issues... Lot of issues
are there.. I have already cited few...

??????? - ??????, ??????????, ?????????? ???? ??????????? ????????????
????????.

???? - Is to let free. Free software is about a user Freedom on a software.

Any software should give a user,

 * The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).
 * The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs
(freedom 1).
   Access to the source code is precondition for this.
 * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom
2).
 * The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the
public,
   so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source
code is a
   precondition for this.

It would be apt to add ???? to ????. ???? ???? can be the suffix... One more
prefix.. Two or three letters...

FSF's definition of free software has repetition of the word program in it.
The freedom is to run, study, distribute and improve a program...

program in Tamil Virtual University Glossary is referred to as ?????????...
In short ????? is also used to refer program..

?????????? ???? (????????) ???? - ????? ???? ????

So shall we have the name of our magazine to be - ????? ???? ???? ?

Logo can be a creative cartoon of a parrot - ??????????? - "?????"  :-)

Give feedback :-)

parrot and pigeon are two birds used by people to send "Thoothu".

Cock and Peacock are associated with Tamilians.  Sevar Kodi is the Flag of
Lord Muruga, the God of Tamils..

Peacock, is also associated with him since ancient times.

Parrot is associated with Thoothu.

Manipura is good.

But Pigeon/ Manipura as a symbol of letters, communication has been used
widely by many.

Just do this instead .. boot into dapper.

Then apt-cdrom add your edgy cd.  Do an apt-get dist-upgrade

IIRC For using cdromupgrade, u must use the alternate CD of edgy. You cant
use the desktop version of the distro.
IMO upgrading is a headache. I reinstalled edgy on my previous dapper.

Subject: [GNU/FSF Press] Press release: FSF announces release of gNewSense 1.0
To: info-press@gnu.org


BOSTON, November 2, 2006 - Free Software Foundation announces release of
gNewSense version 1.0.

(Screenshots available at http://www.fsf.org/news/gnewsense)

gNewSense (http://www.gnewsense.org) is a free software GNU/Linux
distribution created by two Irish free software advocates, Brian Brazil
and Paul O'Malley, and is based on the Ubuntu and Debian distributions.
The goal of gNewSense is to provide users with a software package that
offers the stability of Ubuntu with the addition of freedom.

In announcing the release of version 1.0, the gNewSense developers
stated, "From a philosophical perspective we wanted to create a
GNU/Linux distribution where the user has access to all the sources for
all software on the system. This includes everything from the heart of
the kernel through to the everyday desktop applications."

With the avowed goal of providing a completely free distribution - one
without non-free kernel binary "blobs" or any other non-free software,
the Free Software Foundation has announced sponsorship of the project.
Ted Teah, FSF's free software directory maintainer explained, "With all
the kernel firmware and restricted repositories removed, and the
reliance on Ubuntu's proprietary distribution management tool Launchpad
gone, this distribution is the most advanced GNU/Linux distribution that
has a commitment to be 100% free."

gNewSense will provide users with full security updates and is available
for immediate download in LiveCD ISO format along with a version of the
Ubiquity graphical installer. Furthermore, the gNewSense team has
created a set of software called Builder which allows users to create
their own gNewSense-based distributions.  gNewSense provides detailed
instructions on how to use the software and the recipe to roll out a
customized distro.

The Free Software Foundation is providing the gNewSense team with a high
end build machine (running with a free BIOS), with bandwidth and with
assistance in developing artwork. The FSF plans to aid widespread
adoption of the distribution and, with the release of gNewSense 1.0, is
making a call for volunteers who have the skills to act as the
following:

*  Developers;
*  Website Maintainers;
*  Graphic Artists;
*  Freedom verifiers to monitor package additions and mailing lists;
*  Documentation Writers.

To volunteer, please, sign on at irc.freenode.net and /join #gnewsense.
You can also join the mailing list via the project website
http://www.gnewsense.org/

Just specify the modem port (/dev/ttyacm0 or whatever) in the ppp options

Quite easy in wvdial - for example this is for a tata indicom phone

[Dialer Defaults]
Init1 = ATZ
Init2 = AT+CRM=1
Stupid Mode = 1
ISDN = 0
Modem Type = USB Modem
New PPPD = yes
FlowControl = Hardware (CRTSCTS)
Phone = #777
Modem = /dev/ttyACM0
Username = internet
Password = internet
Baud = 460800

And if you use pppconfig (so that kppp etc will use these)

/etc/chatscripts/tata

These languages are not standalone. they are derived from various other languages. for example telugu is heavily derived from samskritam though the script is different. so are other indian languages except tamil. one can know it from the grammatical syntax  and wordings. i was refering to uniqueness  of a language. when told abt uniqueness, i would like to mention one thing that samskritham has withstood importing of words from other languages since ages. one doesnt find change in grammar or the way one speaks in samskritham since ages. thats not true with other languages. well there are only a few standalone languages - like - samskritham, tamil, latin , hebrew etc from which present day languages arose.

Subject: [Ilugc] Making boot CD- At installation time itself- Possible?
Message-ID: <001001c705f6$bfc98fe0$0201a8c0@DATAONE>

Hi All,

At the completion of installation of any distro, we have an option to make a
boot floppy. Floppy being an unreliable medium, is it possible to make a
boot CD or boot USB disc at the end of installation? Do any of the latest
distros provide this option?

My friend is having WinXP. To make it dual boot, I want this so that I can
install boot loader in the first sector of boot partition and reboot and
enter into linux (through this boot CD/USB and not boot floppy) and make
arrangement for dual boot by copying first 512 bytes of boot sector and
copying it in Windows and modifying boot.ini file.

Pl help

I missed reading your earlier post.

The fsf-tn mailing list is at 
http://gnowledge.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/fsf-tn

Please feel free to subscribe to fsf-tn to discuss localisation plans. 
Nagarjun and a number of others working on various localisation projects 
are part of that list.

It was conceived as a state level list to help co-ordinate free software 
activities here. One of the goals has been to initially have at least 
one fsug in each district. Of course, everything is driven by voluntary 
action and there is no central command there. Out of the chaos we call 
free software, a few sparks do light up things here and there making the 
place bright. If you have plans for fsf-tn, please share it - it could 
help to invite more volunteers.

To create pdf documents, you could use OpenOffice or GNU Texmacs - both 
of which are wysiwyg editors eminently suitable for the purpose at hand. 
OpenOffice by default comes with a pdf button, that could save the 
default opd files in pdf format. With GNU Texmacs, you could create 
content and output files in pdf using File->Export->Pdf

What complication?  It is an online magazine that would probably include 
a number of code snippets, and the GPL would be the best for such a work.

Rubbish.  By legal definition computer programs are literary works, and 
a copyright license that could be used for computer programs could 
easily be used to release literary works - especially an online work 
that is nothing but a computer program which looks like a magazine to 
your eyes.

Subject: [Ilugc] Abstraction
Message-ID: <455676FF.7060905@gmail.com>

The connection between language syntax and tool use is not so obvious.  
Recently, Dr. VS Ramachandran elaborated on the connections between the 
syntax of sentences like: 'She hit the boy who kissed the girl that she 
disliked' and 'He knows that I know that he knows that I had an affair 
with his wife' (hierarchic embedding in language), and tool use - 
especially the sub assembly technique that involves making tools in a 
series of steps, like, making an axe with a head, handle and then using 
the whole as a tool. All these appear to originate from the TPO junction 
in the brain.  He reveals several facts about the mind and may be of use 
to those working on AI.  The Reith Lectures by Dr. VS are available 
online at http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith2003/ 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith2003/>

The following snippet is from the ilugc archives:

<quote>
SK> Now is a GUI necessary? (-:

Yes, very much.  In case you did not realize, the CLI is also a GUI,
its just that its all in pure text.  The point is if you abstract out
everything so that any type of GUI is possible the whole thing becomes
more powerful.  So on the console you use a curses based GUI or if
that is not available just use plain text.  Otherwise you get a nice
GUI where you can select stuff, look at help, search for help, look
for examples etc. [- Prabhu Ramachandran -]
</quote>

Having this idea in mind should help to make free software a more 
powerful option.  I have plans to write gstar - an interface that would 
decide whether to invoke star or gtar in a given situation (both 
released under the GPL).

Thank you for writing that.  I would like to share the following with you.

Chennai has been a cosmopolitan town since time immemorial, and
nurtured the growth of both Sanskrit and Tamil.  The ancient names
have survived and have a story to tell: Velachery is a corruption of
Velvi cheri - a colony inhabited by Sanskrit scholars who built their
philosophies sitting around fire from time immemorial.  The place
where I live is Thiruvanmiyur, and it is a matter of pride that it was
the home of Sage Valmiki once upon a time - his shrine luckily escaped
the ECR bulldozers recently.  Koyambedu derived from "Ko ambu medu" -
the spot where Luva and Kusa are believed to have fenced a meadow with
arrows - the Thenupuriswarar temple folks keep the legend alive to
this day.

AFAIK, Sanskrit still lives vibrantly in TN - it is not very visible
though.  A number of judges and lawyers of the High Court here have
been Sanskrit scholars - a tradition that continues even now. The
Madras Sanskrit College, the Ramakrishna Mutt, and several
institutions in Kanchi do their best to keep Sanskrit in active use.
Some of the good schools here mandate learning of Sanskrit.

Tamil is much lighter than Sanskrit - the main reason it has survived
well.  The fault is not with Sanskrit but just that its utility is not
appreciated enough.  It has a C like charm in its ability to
communicate thought without ambiguity (that would be fairly difficult
in Tamil) or with ambiguities, easy in Tamil also but which may never
be possible with C.   I would boldly say a free software issue in
Sanskrit would be received well here - atleast a hundred people would
promote it enthusiastically. Anyone interested in experimenting here
may please start with just a single page monthly phamplet along with
English translations.

we can keep on adding millions of such things here.. Starting from
Kapilar to Kirupananda variyar..

Starting from Thivakara Nigandu to Veeramamuni's Chaturagarathi...To the
Manavai Mustapa's latest glossary of Technical Tamil Words..

Having come from the Land of Cholas I can site such examples for every
one Kilometer i have wandered :-)

When I conveyed Ubuntu Localisation to my friends who know Sanskrit they
got interested. Also few Telugu friends were interested in Ubuntu
Localisation. But these are so primitive... But the seed is readily
available... Time has to answer... Ubuntu Indian team has a sanskrit
Team. I mailed about my friends interest but no response. Some one from
Ubuntu India Team has to guide. 

Well, coming back to topic, for Tamil FS magazine, a "Suzhi" has already
been put and work has started. Please visit
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/Suzhi/ and start contributing. :-)

i regret to say that misconceptions like this lead to language  
chauvinism. The idea that there are 'pure' languages which are 'first  
class languages' and 'derived' languages, which are 'third class  
languages' has no scientific basis. It is a total misconception, for  
example, to say that telugu, kannada, malayalam are 'derived' from  
tamil. It is not so. All these four languages have evolved from a  
common root - evolved in different ways, and none is superior to the  
other. This is OT anyway. Please note that similar theories (with no  
factual basis) lead to the rise of hitler, milosovic and other  
proponents of ethnic cleansing.

Oh BhathaMatha! Thy have eighteen Languages to speak But one single mind -
Bharathi

Who was born first my elder brother or me is irrelevant to the love of my
mother towards us... We both stand alone.. For me to stand alone my elder
brother has definitely contributed.. That doesn't mean that I am inferior to
him nor am I superior to him... We both are of same family...

Well, Back to topic, it ought to be encouraged to have native language
magazines to take technology to masses.. May it be Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam,
Kannadam, Marathi, Gujarathi, Konkani... Parsi.. what ever it may be...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization

In computing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing>, *virtualization* is
"a technique for hiding the physical characteristics of computing resources
from the way in which other systems, applications, or end users interact
with those resources. This includes making a single physical resource (such
as a server, an operating system, an application, or storage device) appear
to function as multiple logical resources; or it can include making multiple
physical resources (such as storage devices or servers) appear as a single
logical resource."

So simple.. have u read Thirupaavai..

A song begins ????? ????? ??????? ???????.. (Mayanai mannu Vadamadurai
Mainthanai)

Have u heard the song of film Baba... ????  ????  ??????? ????  ????...

Maya is common in most Indian Language...

Virualization is close to this.. In Tamil I can suggest another word
"Mayakkuthal".... "?????????" If one mind can suggest two words for a
concept.. Just think what will happen when a Team sits...

Message-ID: <6F80021E-29D7-4F80-8579-6C8DE688AE41@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

I am making this into a separate thread. Ramdas and I had a meeting  
regarding Suzhi. The idea is to have a space where we could encourage  
and help people who want to read/write technical articles in tamil.  
Ramdas has started contributing some articles on the basics of linux  
- all the articles have a glossary giving the english equivalents of  
tamil technical words. Since this is a wiki, please dont wait for him  
to do all the writing. Even if you add a sentence here or a paragraph  
there or even a suggestion for an alternate word, it helps the corpus  
to grow.

I have started a translation of Eric Raymond's 'The Cathedral and The  
Bazaar'. I am doing this translation in the bazaar model. Translating  
what i feel is important first and doing the rest later. Even here, i  
am leaving words i dont know in english in the hope that the gurus in  
the lug will fill in the gap. Others who would like to translate the  
works of other Gurus like Richard Stallman and Linus Torwalds are  
most welcome to take the initiative. Please give the url to the  
english original so others can contribute.

If we could get a big enough body of work going we will have enough  
stuff to feed a magazine.

Licenses: each individual author may choose whatever license he/she  
wants for the work. However, in translating, it would be prudent to  
keep the same license as the original author.

Hacker dictionary: we are attempting to compile translations of  
technical terms in tamil. Please add english terms here - and  
suggestions for translations too. If we get enough entries, we can  
plan on organising it alphabeticaly with index etc.

Does it use the DSS framework or is it similar to the livecd mastering

100 % CPU usage doesn't mean that all RAM has been used up.
For you, may be malloc in a while(1) loop ?

Perhaps, the command 'cp /dev/urandom /dev/null' in 
the background could help. Yet, its not guaranteed
to bring your system to a crawl. My system still remained
very responsive while showing 99.7% CPU usage 
consistently (and it was a VIA C3 733 MHz box).

Another recipe in perl (for slurping all your available RAM) 
would be this one-liner:
   perl -e 'print (a .. z x 7) while(1)' > /dev/null

Increase or decrease the value (7) depending on your
available memory (inclusive of swap). And yes, setting too
high a value could eventually freeze your system!

Good luck :-)

Note that this list is publicly archived. So, if his dad suddenly
decides to find out how famous his son is online, I am sure the OP is
in for a little trouble :-)

The 1st CD of the all distro is a bootable CD. Use that in rescue mode.

Add sudo nice -20 maybe! Crawls unusably bad (Not tried on this command).

You seem to have ignored and not addressed what I pointed out just 
above. GPL adds restrictions which require every different iteration to 
be maintained separately. Unless you are going to put the whole magazine 
into a SCM I dont see how you can easily resolve that.

Magazine involve fonts too.

I never heard of a online magazine being described as just a computer 
program before. Wouldnt a magazine have editorial columns, opinions, 
reviews etc?

Hmm, there was only one meet in the IRC channel. Almost a month ago. We 
have #linux-india as well as a #ilugchennai available to us. Am not very 
much sure how many people in the mailing list have experience of hanging 
out in IRC :s

Hope we make use of IRC for meeting and discussing routinely, in 
addition to our mailing list and monthly meets in IITM. :)

If you want to manipulate your dad's mind to get you more RAM, maybe
you are looking in the wrong direction of programming... maybe you
should try http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming
;)

More seriously, the most 'natural' way is to lessen memory due to
which the system becomes slow due to heavy swapping. Maybe run tomcat
or somesuch java app that starts with system boot? ;)

However, if you want to just use up the CPU, this spinlocking C
program should do:

void main() { while (1); }

This will simply use up one CPU and any program that needs CPU cycles
will be affected (if you have a multi-processor box or HT then you
will have to run as many instances of this program as the number of
CPUs that your box has). Programs which are, say, interrupt driven
(like a wget instance over a slow connection) won't be affected very
heavily since they are waiting only on IO and not on CPU.

My contribution to this noble cause ;) If you have frequency scaling,
modprobe the cpufreq and cpufreq_powersave modules and write powersave
to the file /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/cpufreq/scaling_governor

N is the cpu number starting from 0... If you have more than one cpu,
like a multicore or a ht system, you will need to do this for each
cpu...

This reduces the cpu to the lowest speed possible...

But this might be a clincher... no need infinite loops... pass mem=64M
to the boot command line and watch the magic :D

it moves on...

Hello,

I'm planning to buy a widescreen laptop (Dell Inspiron or HP dv6000T)
series with a screen resolution of 1200x800. Can some one fill me on
the best distro that works with these models.

Thanks in advance,

Hi,

i have a little bit problem in here in my debian "sarge" box. I cannot open
any graphical
things from my "root" terminal. What i want to mean that, suppose i am using
"su" for root
work from my local user terminal.And if i try to use "gnome-ppp" or "gqview"
or anything..
then it don`t work and the error message came " GTK-Warning: Cannot open
display"

I tried the commands,

     export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0

But nothing change...

So,what should i do?

I am afraid that an optimization technique used these days , would make the

Cross-compile openoffice... Though that's probably overkill! :D

Before doing su, enable X client connections:

  xhost +

No "su -" ('-' adds root environment variables
settings too) and check your DISPLAY variable.

If not set, try:

  export DISPLAY=:0.0

and try to open xterm or any X application from the
terminal.

Or try optimising your system to work best on the RAM
available, thats something you can do with linux. It
could turn out to be fun too...

insecure and not recommended... the best way to do this would be to
use X cookies...

op: use sux instead of su (u might have to install it... may not be
there as a standard program)

it moves on...

This might not work - any self respecting compiler would notice that
the loop is not doing anything and optimize it out. Try a little
modification:

volatile int i = 1;
int main (void) { int j; while (1) j = i; }

This should do the trick.

Suraj: note that in C, main should return an int.

Which one is that? Marutheeswara? (I live in Thiruvanmiyur too).

In any case, ECR does require a lot of widening from Thiruvanmiyur southwards :)

FSF has seriously come out with good product. Creating distro is not an easy
job.  I believe it will help the community adopt linux very quickly.

For anyone who hadnt adopted linux yet, FSF's linux distro would be the last
that would embrace them. What community do you mean?

it is not meant to be a useable distro in production. It is meant to  
be a yardstick for other distros to measure themselves against before  
talking about 'freedom'

Whoa. *blink*. If it's not useful, who cares if it's free, closed or
somewhere in between?

Wow, i thought I should first boot into my machine before doing
anything. Would you pick some eskimo clothing just because it is free?
Utility is more important than anything. How will you have the time to
do things that are useless to you?

And free distro means half the drivers for all those already existent
pci cards on my machine won't work. What can I do with that distro,
even if it is mailed to me free of cost!?

just fork bomb it , but that would make the box unusable.

Here's a nifty one-liner..
: () { : | : & } ; :

: is the function name, it could very well be f, like this
f () { f | f & } ; f

or

f()
{
	f | f&

+1.

Just one question, how good is the SMP scheduling on OpenBSD. Any feedback ?

For the rest, See this on why BLOB's are dangerous..

http://www.openbsd.org/lyrics.html#39

Also, gNewSense is very usable, Mark Pilgrim tried it out and it all
devices on his PC were supported. His account is available here :

And Debian testing/unstable is equally good on my DELL XPS m1210.

FUD

quoting mark pilgrim :

"Will I switch from Ubuntu to gNewSense? No. But I could, and that's
enough of a victory for today."

Will I switch from Debian to Ubuntu ? No! but it's always good to know
that there's a distro out there which could give me something which
"Just Works!". It's the same case with gNewSense, if in future someone
(like Mark) needs to move from Ubuntu to a completely free distro
which is "not tainted", it's possible.

He also mentions very clearly why gNewSense is required :
"this is one distribution that the world absolutely does need."

and..

"The gNewSense maintainers apparently feel that saying you're "a
little bit non-free" is akin to saying you're "a little bit pregnant."
Close doesn't count, and even if people don't notice the difference
today, they'll definitely notice it nine months from now."

The word he uses is "reference implementation" and not "proof-of-concept".

It looked it those words were sneaked in as though it was his conclusion.

Will you switch from vi to emacs or vice-versa ?
Will you switch from python to perl ?

Ubuntu is what "works" for him , the same way the software mentioned
above "works" for you.

Correct. It's there to be used by people who need it.

Apparently , the current developers and maintainers of gNewSense.

As long as there is _ONE_ person using a piece of software, the need
is justified.

Just read and enjoy! :)

It is like a nice thriller novel. :)

Written by none other than the author of PGP Phil Zimmerman.

I hear that he was subsequently jailed or something but I am more likely to be wrong. :)

I know this much that he was penalised for popularising strong unbreakable crypto.

(yes, copied from OpenBSD man page :)

Enjoy! :)

Thank You. But I am happy with my sarge 3.01rc1 that works presently
with the non-free drivers installed. Maybe it wont do beryl or compiz,
but it neednt either. i have real bad ram and all it needs to do is
some java/python which it does well.

I did not need any suggestion for a distro. But I wanted to say that
all-free distro must also be all-usable distro, especially when you
have some machines that you purchased before you heard of linux.
atleast i did that once.

else  in the hope that someone wud ve done sumting similar b4. I don want 
the list to do my work, jes share tips on confign if sum1 in the list 
knows.

If you've actually googled, then ask specific questions on what you
tried to do, what worked, what didn't work etc.

Another quick google search would raise you an interesting little doc
called "how to ask smart questions"

Can sound stupid, but I solved similar problems by force loading the

Usually., when the X does not identify the mouse., I just replug the
mouse and restart gdm. I've had this issue with almost every mouse i used.

One reason why sticking to PS/2 is better for mice/keyboard.

i know it is difficult - but you cant have it both ways. Either  
convince your employer that the disclaimer should be removed in mails

I too had a similar issue with Ubuntu. When I connect my mouse to a
USB port, it doesn't work. Luckily my mouse came with a USB to PS/2
adapter and after plugging in the mouse to the PS/2 port, it works
fine.

Check your bind install / named.conf - you'd typically define the key in
rndc.conf

Just searching for "dnssec-keygen named.conf" gave me yet another useful
link ..

http://caunter.ca/nsupdate.txt

Remember - if you're using a prepackaged (rpm, deb etc) version of bind,
the actual filenames, paths etc of this stuff can vary.

Why dont you make it naturally slow?
Pass  ``mem=16M''  or something to the kernel from your grub or lilo
configuration file.
Linux will behave as if you are in 20th century :)

I guess I already recommended this... But 16M is a bit too much... 64M
should be good enough for the current distros... :)

it moves on...

The real success is only when a bio-tech student is allowed to take foss
as an elective. I hold my engineering degree in biotechnology and now i
work programmer for a company that does "scientific and technical
computing in bio-informatics domain". 

If I had the opportunity of selecting foss as an elective during college
day, my life will be much better now.

Though I am happy that FOSS-II is approved, I feel we need to assess
the impact of FOSS-I so far. It is very sad that there is no
practicals for FOSS-I. I was astonished when a student told she has
not even for a  moment worked on linux. The irony is the entire batch
of student from this particular college passed out well in FOSS-I.

Some urgent action is required on the part of NRCFOSS and Anna
University to setup FOSS Lab and allow student to practice rather
than mug what is in the book.

In my humble opinion FOSS-I has not made any impact - atleast among
the students with whom I interacted.

I dont understand why they chose perl in second  after they learn python.

I have migrated from perl to python in bioinfo for reasons of maintainability of the code. Perl is sphagettic if code becomes larger.

You may look at what supermarkets like Food World(Spencers Daily) do.

You can easily generate unique bar code labels and paste it on each of your hardware components.

Then you can get a cheap bar code scanner( a device that converts bar codes to key presses), it emulates a keyboard using USB interface. 

Once your bar code is read, the component is uniquely identified and you can retrieve the particulars from a database. All of these stuff is available open source and free of cost. But it needs some patient time to study and research.
> 2. To maintain a library management

You could use the bar code approaches to books too. But library management needs some special care since you will have to track where each book is kept, how long it is lent and all that.

Ask the  google Goddess for this and she shall help you out. Lot  of work has gone into it and several open source options are there.

Pick one that suits your taste best.

No direct email client support is needed. Typical approach is to have a web page with a simple html form. People can fill up the form and the backend sends email.

Are the Time Zones set to the same region on both distros? One of them
might have the time zone set to UTC. You could try googling for how to
change the setting from UTC to your local time.

I saw your query. Only reason I did not reply is that I did not know the answer.It is not because of any other reason.

You are welcome to contact me off list and I can help you out(including of course giving you my mobile number. :)

Set your time zone as either "localtime" or "GMT" in both ubuntu and 
debian. Ensure that both are same. Then set the time in one distro. It 
will be reflected in both distros.

It deals with Remington Keyboard Layout installation. Would like some one to
verify the same.

Now like this, I request some one to take up Inscript also. am not much
aware of that. Atleast I could learn.

Zico i guess you have UTC enabled in any one of the distro , which means the 
time difference of 5:30 min would exsits between both distro ,either have 
both set as UTC or not that should solve your problem.

And I am assuming you didn't teach your dad how to ask

It would be interesting if your Dad also subscribes to
ILUGC, and posts a query about the box freezing?

Yes. 

Since these posts are archived, it wouldn't be long

home :)

Message-ID: <5d0d0e310611130931x34497bf4mc14cf67967d20101@mail.gmail.com>

Friends,
Tamil text with fixed fonts don't seem to show up right in Firefox.
This site (http://nrcfosshelpline.in/Suzhi/drtv/translation_help) for
example has Tamil text in the "<pre>" tag and doesn't render nicely.
Same is the case for sans-serif fonts. Serif fonts are rendered
perfectly. To overcome this, I tried setting all three {serif, sans,
monospaced} to serif fonts in "Fonts for: Tamil" option but for some
strange reason this setting is not reflected but when I do the same in
"Fonts for: Western" the setting is reflected on the page and the text
in "<pre>" tag is displayed in serif font. Do anybody else face the
same issue. Is there something else I can do to enable fixed width
Tamil font support.

PS:
1. Firefox was built with PANGO support
2. ttf-tamil fonts are installed
3. Character encoding is set to UTF8

to be honest not many of us know about fonts its type, what is Serif
fonts, Monospace fonts... etc.,

It would be nice and encouraging if someone could start writing about
them in brief/ detail in Suzhi...

Possibly the only way to convince...Search around for a defective

- Serif fonts are the one which come with small ticks at the ends of the glyph.
- *Sans*-serif fonts are the one with out these ticks.
- Monospace fonts are fixed with fonts (eg: i and H are of same width).

there is spam everywhere! We want to keep the wiki editable by all -

Spam = by bots and scripts that'll sign up hundreds of accounts to your
wiki and then use those accounts to stuff your wiki with porn links

You need to allow signup only by the moderator, as in ilugc or other
mailing lists. And then allow pages only to be edited by people with
accounts on the wiki.

That is great!  Let us start a Thiruvanmiyur FSUG while we are still 
there ;)  I am game for weekend meets at any location along the ECR - 
now sold as 40 KMS of non-stop excitement. Bharathi used to live here 
too, now if more people do live here, let us please meet sometime.  Of 
course, we may discuss free software only while playing football or

It is twice or thrice as big as it used to be a decade ago.  The widened 
ECR must already be a great nuisance for turtles and crocs that live 
along the coast.

I would like to know if there is single free ttf Tamil font based on the 
Manual Tamil Typewriter Keyboard layout.

I have been using a proprietary Tamil font for long, that I purchased 
for about Rs. 100/-. All that I do is copy the font to .fonts in my home 
directory, and it is immediately available (I think Xserver takes care 
of this) in OpenOffice or any other editor and I simply select the font 
to type in Tamil. If I want to change to English, I simply have to 
select an English font on the editor toolbar.

The SCIM and Keyboard Indicator programs seem to apply globally to all 
applications - I certainly don't want to be using Tamil to enter console 
commands even if I have a opened an editor to do some work in Tamil. The 
SCIM route appears to be an overkill for Tamil which is not so 
complicated like the Chinese, Japanese or Korean scripts based on 
thousands of ideograms.

Anyway, I installed the Remington layout you pointed to here, and it is 
visible in the System>Preferences>SCIM_Input_Method_Setup under the 
global setup page. I have scim running but I can't get to using Lohit 
Tamil or the others in OO. The tamil font does print on the console, but 
it is not perfect - the pulli are never in their place. The Remington 
Layout is not available as an option in the "Keyboard Indicator" program 
on the panel. What is that I am missing?

Thanks,
Ramanraj K

If you are using Ubuntu,

http://ubuntu-tam.org/tamil_ubuntu_wiki/index.php/%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%AE%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B4%E0%AF%8D_%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D_%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%86%E0%AE%B1%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B1%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8A%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B3

The above page describes customization of Ubuntu to suit tamil. Ubuntu have
three Unicode fonts Kadambari, Maduram and another one. They indeed work
fine.

Well this should help. Else kindly specify.. We will try resolving the same.

The OSS community is based on the notion of trust and altruism where
people spend years developing software to practically give away so that
others may also benefit. This LUG is also based on the same concept - many
people answer queries and help out people on this list even though they
themselves get nothing in return except perhaps some acknowledgement and
additional experience solving problems.

If you are willing to cheat your dad to get some RAM, I will worry for
anyone who employs you or works with you. I would suggest that you speak
to your Dad - he may be willing to give you the RAM. Else, you can
consider saving up some pocket money, or perhaps even do something small -
such as helping out at a shop/office for a few days to make the money you
need to buy RAM. It will be far more rewarding than the method you have
adopted.

I would like to have the layout of Remington and by default it won't come in
Ubuntu. Phonetic and Inscript are the default Keypads in Tamil.

Well we can indeed take it up get it done in Ubuntu. Can some some one send
the layout of Remington? Or it has to be prepared? in a .png format....

NAS - Network Attached Storage - is basically a box with massive
storage space and its own TCP/IP stack and an administrative
interface. It exports filesystems over predominantly NFS or CIFS.
Client machines mount the shares (who can mount can be controlled on
the NAS box by specifying ACLs or the like) over the LAN via TCP/IP.
Throughput is dictated by network latency and bandwidth (on a
well-designed gigabit LAN, you can get 100 MB/sec throughput though).
Big vendors include EMC, HP etc. You can build a home-grown one with a
regular PC  and a few IDE disks, running Linux/*BSD and NFS/Samba.

SAN - Storage Area Network - is a separate network itself, with
cabling (fibre in the most common case, but copper is not unheard of),
switches and routers distinct from the LAN gear. Client machines
require hardware units called HBAs (Host Bus Adapters - usually a PCI
card from Emulex or QLogic) with appropriate drivers. The HBA is
connected to the nearest SAN switch (similar to hooking the network
adapter to the nearest LAN switch), to which the storage unit is also
connected. If things go well, the HBA driver exposes a block device to
the host OS, which can be partitioned, formatted with a regular
filesystem type (ext3, reiser, whatever) and used as if it is a local
attached drive. Big players in this market are EMC and Fujitsu, among
others. Thoughput is as good as host attached storage typically.

To justify investment in a SAN, one should ideally have storage
requirements of several terabytes whereas a NAS can be built cheaply
enough for even SMBs and home users.

SAN can also be built using iSCSI speaking devices and regular
ethernet cabling. A Chennai company called Sanatdata sells IDE HDD
based iSCSI devices. Costwise compares very well with the big guns in
storage! Another option is ATAoE. However, as of now only one company
in this space.

Another off-the-shelf hardware approach is to use a GNBD server (a
linux box with regular ide hdd) to export block devices over ethernet
and GNBD clients (on the hosts that need storage) to import these
devices. I did this with a CentOS distro and it works. Am yet to
achieve clustering though!

What do you mean by not connecting ? Any errors ? Most of us have/had 
BSNL Dataone Connection and UT-300R2 modem. Btw, that modem can be 
configured to connect on its own when switched on. You can try that and 
just give the modem's IP (192.168.1.1) as the gateway. No pppoe at all, 
just like connecting to a LAN.

The only thing I missed was creating the 75custom-scim_init file with 
the entries:

export XMODIFIERS="@im=SCIM"
export GTK_IM_MODULE="scim"
export XIM_PROGRAM="scim -d"

Now, it works absolutely great. I finally use a system that is totally 
free !! Thanks a lot.

I found a manual typewriter layout image at:
http://www.infitt.org/tamilnet97/doc-draft/typewriter.gif

I would suggest you may also use the vendor neutral "manual tamil 
typewriter keyboard layout" or something shorter like "manual keyboard" 
instead of a specific brand name.

Naming the layout "typewriter" should do.

I was telling about making Remington readily available when scim-tables are
installed for Ubuntu. rather than we going and downloading from source. and
then installing it. :-) I think remington has been added, off late to scim
tables and it should be available from feisty Ubuntu release six months
later. we need to check though :-)

The manual for keyboard should indeed be neutral.

Does Core 2 Duo work effectively with Linux? Does the kernel see a
Core 2 Duo as 2 separate processors and splits the process on them or
is it taken care by the processor
itself.

Heard Core 2 Duo + Hyperthreading equals 4 virtual processors? Is this
true and if true,
does the linux kernel recognize that as 4 different processes?

Hi Girish,

> I think it might be a low level MTU issue. I only faced a problem like this when I set the MTU smaller than the layer 2 size.

Thanks for your help. It was an MTU issue.

MTU used by dial-up phone was 264. I changed to 1500 and then everything 
was working fine.

Thanks again

No, just two. "cat /proc/cpuinfo" should show two
processors, and each processor will have two entires
for fpu.

Subject: [Ilugc] UTF-8 and indic languages
Message-ID: <455A902D.5040005@gmail.com>

Tamil and other indic scripts are 3 bytes per character if encoded
with UTF-8. That appears to be expensive.  Unicode says we could 
compress with algorithms but it would make every processor along the way 
crawl needlessly.

The basic alphabet for computing in Tamil takes up only 31 characters, 
and it is around that number for most indic languages. In the ASCII 
table, if we could map the space allocated for a-z to represent vowels 
and A-Z to represent consonants, that would leave enough gaps for even 
others and pave way to use just one byte per character.

There is no harm in using UTF-8 like some kind of universal language 
look up table as long as some intelligent mapping is done and followed 
for indic language processing needs in the existing ASCII code table.

Has anyone studied UTF-8 from the point of view of indic language computing?

I was telling about making Remington readily available when scim-tables are installed for Ubuntu. rather than we going and downloading from source. and then installing it. :-) I think remington has been added, off late to scim tables and it should be available from feisty Ubuntu release six months later. we need to check though :-)

The manual for keyboard should indeed be neutral.

Can you be more specific?  Where are you invoking %c etc?  These are
context sensitive .. if you run one of those in a hook from cvs up,
you'd get %c as "update"

no - all the other languages have 4 times the number of characters  
than tamil. Example:
tamil has ka, other languages:
ka kha ga gha

His dsl modem keeps giving him new IPs with dhcp, and its configured to
have 192.168.1.1 as the dns server.  Probably has a dns proxy built in
that often doesn't work too well, so he notices it.

Go login to the dsl modem (http://192.168.1.1 or whatever) and change
the dns servers in there to bsnl's dns servers.

Or run bind / dnscache on your local box and then set dhclient.conf /
dhcpcd.conf or whatever you use to have something like this

prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;

Check this, not pretty sure whether this will help, but it has some 
dnscache stuff in it..

I want to create triggers for naming conventions to be followed during
tag and branch creation. In taginfo I couldn't trace whether tag is
being created or branch is being created.

These are the values which we can access in taginfo file
%p Directory name relative to the current root.
%m Message supplied on the command line.
%s List of files being tagged
%v List of versions being tagged
%b tag type
%o tag operation
%t tag name

My taginfo file's content :
ALL /netapp/home/s3428/umacvs/CVSROOT/loggit %t %b %o %p %{sVv} %c

Loggit's content
#!/bin/sh
echo "$@" >>/netapp/home/s3428/umacvs/CVSROOT/taglog

And taglog's content
%t %b %o %p %{sVv} %c tag11 add /netapp/home/s3428/umacvs/trunk test1.c
1.1.1.1 test2.c 1.1.1.1 test3.c 1.1.1.1

%b and %c doesn't have any content .... Is it any configuration issue???
%c - is supposed to hold the current command being executed 

Thanks 
Kavitha

Can you be more specific?  Where are you invoking %c etc?  These are
context sensitive .. if you run one of those in a hook from cvs up,
you'd get %c as "update"

Hi,

computing?

Time for UTF-16. Do not know much about all these though.. We have form a
Team who will deliberatly look into the encoding stuff.. May be a Team of
two or three...

Recently Tamil Virutual University, Thanjavur submitted a memorandum to the
Tamil Nadu Government about the 16-bit encoding. They even conducted a
conference. Download the document in both Engilsh and Tamil Versions
unfortunately .doc format :-(

get enough mail-confirmations.

Agreed...Firstly negotiating with my dad is not worthwhile..Secondly he
refuses to add RAM even if I buy it from my own pocket money..So the
only way is to show him that adding RAM could pep up my computer.. For
doing that, I should slow down the system. If my system was running
doze, It would not have been a worry at all..just browsing the internet
with the trusted "ie" would do the job. Unfortunately I run linux and
E17 as my window manager, so I did write some scripts in bash to clog
the resources but it didnt work..so henceforth i asked the community for
help
Lastly, but most importantly my dad wouldnt spank me even if he finds
that I had raised such a question to the community, infact he wouldnt
mind at all given his playful nature..Some people have to be shown
solutions to problems the hard way, and I am afraid this one of them,
for a simple reason that I know my dad more than you do...

Apologies if you think I had disrespected the ethics of FOSS...

Cheers :)

My wife (not the OP) works for CTS, she's the only one I'd answer
immediately, but I dont know how or why that's your concern

As for Kavitha, she's asked a specific question [but one that'd
definitely get covered in the cvs faq .. she has to remember that %c etc
is only in the context of the command that's being executed and relative
to her CVSROOT and other environment variables). Could read the cvs
manual - http://ximbiot.com/cvs/manual/cvs-1.12.12/cvs_18.html#SEC196

"Thandhaikku upadesam" the hard way? :-)

Fine, it's between you and your dad. But it is isn't ethics of free
software, as you have mentioned. It's just _plain_ ethics, or lack of
it, that bothers me...

Anyway, I'll stop here.

Ya. You can net boot the PCs using the pxe, tft and nfs/http/ftp.
http://www.stanford.edu/~alfw/PXE-Kickstart/PXE-Kickstart.html
I used this with fedora. You can basically use any distro that can
install over network.

> If the above is not possible, how to create CDs from the DVD.
Just get the installer image and burn it to a cd. You can start the
installation with it. You get it for debian. So you might get it for
the others also.
> Many software were installed using apt-get install.How to get those software
> from this PC so that i need not go for net again.
Create a mirror-like setup with what you have downloaded already on
the existing machine. That way you might even be able to propagate
updates to the newly installed. I don't have the exact links, but I
remember reading about setting up mirrors in the debian site. Simpler
yet, just go through the tree in the iitm ftp site and create yours in
a similar fashion.

Hope that helps.

The funny thing is.. after prodding sun to opensource java
the big blue is actually upset that sun chose GPL for it.
IBM apparently expected a less restrictive license like Apache's.
Guess who ended up being clever?

I was wrong. With UTF-8 encoding, ? takes 3 bytes, ?? takes 6 bytes and 
?? would take 9 - I was thinking all the three would take 3 bytes each, 
and that was expensive. Under the usual ASCII toggle scheme, they would 
take 1, 2 and 3 bytes respectively. Anyway, filling up the missing chars 
may be more useful and that seems to be the real issue now.

Was any invitation to the Conference sent to ILUGC, FSF-India or any of 
the free software user groups in India? I may have missed seeing it.

I am afraid I could not follow many of the statements in that conference 
document. They don't seem to be talking about UTF-16 (that requires 4 
bytes for each character). Substantially, it looks like they would like 
the Unicode Consortium to amend the UTF-8 encoding table to accomodate 
all the 247 Tamil Characters, along with other special characters to 
denote numerals, the vada sol chars and other special chars. While that 
is commendable and would correct the situation to some extent, I totally 
fail to follow what the experts call as "Unique encoding standard for 
Tamil". Unicode is a common encoding standard for the whole world. The 
paper should be written with more clarity, so that the folks at Unicode 
Consortium can follow and act on the request.

It says:
<quote>
75% supported the view that the effort of implementing 16?bit encoding 
for Tamil can be independent of similar efforts for other Indian languages.
</quote>

I belong to the 25% who oppose that view and would stay, it is of 
crucial importance to co-ordinate such efforts along with all the other 
indic language working groups - who are also in the same boat. While 
making requests for amendments, it should be noted:

The ASCII character encoding is smart in the following ways:

- the Lsb's for numerals (0, 1, 2, ... 9) represent the numbers 
themselves (0000, 0001, 0010 ... 1001)
- ASCII integers can be converted to binary by flipping bits 5 and 4 to 0
- Uppercase to lower case could be done by flipping bit 5 from 0 to 1
- Uppercase alphabets can be converted to control characters by flipping 
bit 6 of Msb from 1 to 0

How elegant!

Now, UTF-8 has room for all the chars in all the languages of the world. 
It ought to be easy for us to transliterate from one indic language to 
another, without much coding effort - by just flipping a few bits. If we 
don't do it now, when else would we do it? As far as possible, all the 
indic languages should be allocated contigious space so that phonetic 
connections etc could be easily seen and dealt with elegantly. Also, the 
characters should be arranged so that sorting is possible. The Tamil 
chars in the existing UTF-8 encoding table seem to arranged in a random 
order.

Also, we should ask for including Sanskrit and Tamil in the UTF-8 ranges 
higher than the basic multilingual plane, so that they can be encoded 
with just 2 bytes, placing them along with Latin and Greek.

As an user I have faced few problems in using UTF-8 fonts... I have not
tried any of the other..

In Gedit for example sometimes when we try to use the <-- Back key to move
to the previous character it will not move properly.. There are several such
small small issues to be solved..

One of my friend said UTF-16 will address these issues.. Would like experts
comments here..

Wouldn't that be a Gedit bug rather an a problem with UTF8 itself?

Subject: [Ilugc] BSD licensed implementation of ELF and GELF
Message-ID: <455B44A3.9010001@gmail.com>

For the attention of any BSD aficionados here:

__fwd message from Joseph Koshy__

The past few months I have been writing a BSD-licensed
implementation of the SysV ELF(3) and GELF(3) API.

These APIs allows you to write applications that manipulate
ELF files, e.g., nm, strip, ld.  The GELF(3) API permits
applications to be written in an ELF class (32/64 bit)
agnostic way.

It is now available here:
 http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/lib/libelf/

It implements 82 public APIs, in approx 8K LoC of code,
and documents them in 4.5K lines of manual pages.  An
accompanying TET based test suite is about 10K LoC of
M4/C code.  The test suite is still only about half way
done.

I guess the problem is with insufficient number of codes allocated to Tamil.
If every character is allocated a unicode value totalling 247+ codes
then much of the problem with rendering and input will be gone.

Values in the range 0800 - FFFF can be coded in 2 bytes using UTF16
where as it will need 3 bytes in UTF8. For documents written entirely
in Tamil (0B80 - 0BFF) UTF16 will give a 33% saving.

Yes it will solve a lot of other issues and will simplify searching
and processing of Tamil text.

I haven't read the document completely. But it is confusing (What is
16-bit Unicode system?)
- Unicode is a 4byte coding scheme developed to represent all language.
- On the assumption that the codes for characters used in a document
will be concentrated on one particular region different encoding
schemes were developed to optimize space: UTF8, UTF16, UTF32.

I too strongly agree with you. Unicode makes it possible to mix
different languages in a simple text document which, otherwise, would
not have been possible.

Truly these are some nice suggestions, I hope these concerns are taken care

Well I could not understand most of these .. but getting to it slowly :-)
Appears to be good idea though!

Well who is going to ask and to whom are we going to ask?

FSF to Unicode Consortium or FSF to government of Tamil Nadu / India?

Suresh,

	Wow man! You are a star! The foto is quite cool as well much better than the one you have in your website. :)

	I liked your informal way of answering questions.

	We are blessed to have known a star like u. :)

	May God bless you in all your future endeavors!

	And help us mere mortals to get where you are (twinkle).

i think so - i have been using utf-8, not only for indian languages,  
but also for other languages since about 2000 with no problems.

To update u all on Suzhi,

We now have four writers at Suzhi,

1) Dr T Vasudevan
2) Kenneth
3) Vikram Sai Balaji
4) Sri Ramadas...

We are expecting few more and inviting every one of you :-)

Well would like to follow the following structure while writing Book pages,

<Title of the page>

<content>
--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------
</content>

<link to previous page> <link to first index page> <link to last page>

<Details of each technical Tamil word used in this page and their equivalent
English word>

<Mission Statement: ???????? ??????? ????????? ?????? ???  ??????? ????????>

A sample page of this kind: http://nrcfosshelpline.in/Suzhi/
??????????_??????_?????????

Since we are having only a few number of pages we are putting them and their
details at the bottom of first page.. You can have a look at it...

Awaiting all your encouragement and feedback :-)

Hi all,
   I was using dataone connection for the past 1 year on a Huawei
Smart Mt800. During the recent thunderstrom my modem was burnt and the
people at BSNL says that they don't provide service for the  ADSL
modems. So, I am struck now. So, can anyone tell me who services the
Huawei ADSL modems in chennai.

I have also decided to buy a new ADSL modem. Can anyone tell me which
is better for BSNL dataone and compatible with linux. What is the
price of it? Which brand ?

Thank you,

if it is burnt by lightning i would suggest a funeral - repair  
charges would be more than modem cost.

I've found BSNL's offering to be the cheapest and pretty rich in 
features. I do not think any one else sells a router for Rs.1200/-. It 
takes them 15 days to deliver though. Wish they had a OTC sale mechanism 
or a retail option.

One very simple way.  Windows PCs get infected with viruses, and virus
infected PCs are among the single largest sources of spam / DDoS etc
traffic in the world today.  The more linux boxes there are (and there
are several publicly available PCs in kiosk setups that are now linux,
the world over .. for example if you fly Lufthansa - check out the
frankfurt airport lounges. There are some public access internet
terminals there, basically small PCs that run SuSE and boot into a very
restricted X session that only loads firefox). No chance of that kind of
PC, used by a wide variety of people, getting infected.

ps: At least in India, Sify iWay tried using linux PCs with the standard
iway frontend but they had this badly botched implementation and very
old OS (rh 9 when fc3/fc4 was out) so that it was not very usable for
most people who went there.. if I went to an iWay and sat at a linux PC,
the cafe guy would say "sir, thats a linux PC, take that other PC over
there, its windows". :)

Another thing is that FOSS software is free as in beer, besides the
"free as in freedom" thing.  Certainly a rather more attractive
alternative for cash strapped ISPs in developing countries, than buying
licenses for an expensive mailserver on windows (and a lot more, and far
more powerful servers to install windows + that mailserver software on)

I know people who can run mail for several dozen to a few hundred users
on an old 486 without any problems, if that box is running linux (in
fact I set up a few of those using uucp over dialup for some branch
offices, in a previous job years back).  Try to do the same thing in
windows and you'd need far more ram / disk space / cpu, and you'd spend
a lot more on licenses if you went and bought exchange or notes instead
of installing postfix.

There's more, but these two are the most visible benefits of FOSS
against antispam.

There are plenty other reasons of course. :)

Bruce Schneier, the most respected cryptographer on earth(though there are better guys) has always been advocating open algos and source code for strong crypto.

'Security thro' obscurity' is a losing proposition. I look at spam,viruses,worms etc. as the sister fields of crypto though I would hesitate from calling it security topics.

Now, I will go to the extreme of saying that open source is a one stop solution for all technology problems on earth but I think hardly 1% of ILUGC will agree with me on that. ;)

In purely practical terms , most anti spam solutions are open source. And anti spam is more of an individual preference issue than something black and white. Well not always but sometimes.

So you may not like an e-mail about a Nigerian widow or Vi***a  but I may love it. :)

So each individual has to "train" or educate his own spam filter based on his preferences. And this corpus needs to talk to other such databases for quickness and early efficiency.

Without free sharing of data, information and customization possibilities this model cannot work.

I can conceive that such things can theoretically be done in a closed source manner too but it is incredibly impossible to predict what the user will want accurately. Customization and closed source are not bed fellows.

Moreover open source is excellence, open source is worldclassness, open source is quality of the highest order...

You know quite well what else I will say. So I will stop.

Best,
Girish

The easiest way to install Ruby is by using which ever package
management tool your distro uses. If you're talking about one-click
installer for windows, then you have to wait until Rubyforge comes back up.

Dear friends,

Raja told me to apply

apt-get install rails

Magic word apt-get works yet again, thanks for the package management.

Hacker Agarathi - Guidelines suggestions..

Hi every one,

That was a gr8 name to begin with. Well here are few suggestions.. Right now
English technical words and their proposed equivalent Tamil words are being
added to one single page...

http://nrcfosshelpline.in/Suzhi/Hacker_??????

As words pile up it may not give desired results.. Keeping in view of that,
an alphabetical grouping of words is necessary,

So,

If u type in future, on the web browser,

http://nrcfosshelpline.in/Suzhi/A

it will give all words compiled beginning with A.

Similarly for B, http://nrcfosshelpline.in/Suzhi/B

We can have 50 words in a page, two column.. each having 25 words and then
keep on adding new page if more and more words comes.. by giving next page
link under each page..

Also its worthwhile to define each word.. how it came and examples of using
it in a word specific page..

Say i have for Directory - ????? (Adaivu), a link on that word would lead me
to a page where in i will find the definition of the word.. and sample words
as to how to use and where to use..

So this will help people not only in knowing the words but also how to use
them..

These can form long term objectives...

Thats it for now :-)

Well, one doubt.. is there a provision of taking daily backup of contents of
Suzhi?

Message-ID: <20061116174158.46302.qmail@web90505.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,
Does anyone have information about whether Reliance
Broadband is good and whether it works with linux. 

I have been trying to get BSNL broadband and submitted
request 3 weeks ago. After sometime, found out that
they dont have wireless modem, out of stock. (after
waiting for a long time)

When I called them to see if I could buy my own modem
and asked them for information about the model, they
couldnt provide information.

After multiple calls and talking to senior people in
BSNL, I think I am better off getting a connection
from 
some other provider with better customer service, and
one that I could use linux with.

I was thinking of BSNL as we already have BSNL phone
line.

Thanks 
Sanjay

Any ADSL modem should do i guess. But BSNL's Wireless router is the cheapest
available in market. You surely wont get one in the market for Rs.1800

Hi all,

How do you reply to your mom when she tries to wake you up in the morning?
"Amma! Amma! please ma.. innum konjam neram thoonga viden..."

How do you ask your dad to buy a bike.? "Appa.. appa.. College pogarathukku
pudusa oru bike vaangi kungalen.."

How dou u ask your friend to accompany you to Satyam Talkies.. "Machi!
Vaada.. Naalaikku Varalaaru Pakka Polam"

How do u speak to your gf! "" (sorry, no comments, personal matters...)

How do you discuss with your friends about a Cricket Match, Politics etc.,
etc.,

So your language which is capable of expressing all your feelings above can
also express your thoughts and ideas in Technical aspects too.. The only
thing is that the oppurtunity might not have been provided for that...

Well, Personally, I have seen lot of my friends who are technically sound..
will not simply express his ideas and views because of some kind of an
inferiority complex that, what they might speak in English may be wrong...
It should not and never be an issue henceforth...

We at Ubuntu Tamil Wanna end this... Presenting you, the Ubuntu Tamil
Forum.. where you can debate and discuss technical issues in our mother
Tongue... thamizh.ubuntuforums.org

Presenting you the , Ubuntu Tamil Nadu Users mailing list,
https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-tam

And also we have an IRC channel: #ubuntu-tam @ freenode

We already have Suzhi to mold us into Technical Writing.. Only thing we need
is all your support and encouragement...

true - but in the typical foss development model, we keep everything  
on one page until it becomes too big - then split like A-L and M-Z,  
and then keep splitting as it grows. Nothing more annoying than to go  
to a page with nothing on it.

Hi Fred
 
I was complaining about not receiving mails from ilug-Chennai and ilug_Goa for sometime. To my surprise I found both email ids were blocked by Yahoo. After removing them from blocked list, now I am receiving the mails.
 
Thanks

good service ;-) I got a free email id there with a web interface  
that works - only catch is that it allows you to send only one mail  
every 20 minutes and you have to state that 'I love microsoft' to get  
the id.

actualy the current version of the joke is that 'emacs is an  
operating system, and the only thing it lacks to become complete is a  
decent text editor'

hi everybody:

1. Anna University normally gives a list of electives for a given
semester. However, FOSS electives could be taken in any semester in
which electives are offered [CSE (6th and 8th sem) and IT (8th sem)].
Our suggestion is : CSE6th should take Elective I and the 8th sem
students of CSE/IT could take the Elective II. I would appreciate if
you could send us a mail and discuss how we could cooperate to "sell"
the elective to the students and make the effort fruitful.

2. The absence of lab component is a serious drawback. However, some
colleges had provided a semblance of FOSS lab. NRCFOSS is in the final
stages of the FOSS Lab "server" which will contain most of the
docs/reports/codes of relevance to the electives -- we plan to demo it
during FOSS.IN. Once the college provides a FOSS Lab with the server
and 10-20 systems, the students could have a better chance. We also
hope that the student projects in FOSS will increase.

3. FOSS is not confined to CSE/IT. However, I would not like to
venture for "FOSS courses" for other branches. They could (a) have
exposure in the first year -- computer practice course could have a
unit on FOSS concepts & philocophy ; the lab could have Open Office
components and (b) during later semesters get guidance to use the open
source packages of relavance to them. Hope to catch you all on the
"migration" work during the forthcoming months.

Srinivasan, NRCFOSS.

You might want to sign up for the Chennai.rb list for Ruby/Rails
specific queries:

http://groups.google.com/group/chennairb

Regarding your error, most probably because the file 'server' in the
script directory is not executable. You might want to make all the files
in that directory executable.

Check your postgresql.conf and see if tcpip_socket = true or not.

Oops, my bad - didn't know about that one - did you set both 'local' and
'host' directives to trust? This might sound silly, but just checking -
did you do 'createuser' with postgres login?

if you had looked at my original post, you would have found that all  
this had been done long ago, this is not the problem - the problem  
was that selinux had been installed. Once that was reset to  
permissive mode, the problem was solved. Aparently fc6 has strictest  
selinux installed by default

yes yes yes and yes - anyway as already mentioned, the guy had  
selinux running which was preventing creation of a socket

Hi,

My thoughts below:

Indeed.

Quite a number of students living in hostels in the
colleges have their own computer or share it with
their roommates. So, these can definitely complement
the FOSS lab resources that colleges may or may not
provide.

The major constraint that I see is a *proper* 24x7
Internet connection at these colleges (at cities,
towns, villages). If they want to work with FOSS
projects, they need to be able to *use* the Internet,
and discuss with developers/mentors through mailing
lists/IRC/forums.

Should alteast aim for one system per student. Nothing
like hands-on experience.

SK

Dear Friends,

Just started with Ruby on Rails,  coming from a php environment, Horray what
a framework, Just say zip zap zoom and the app is ready. It is really the
one to match the requirement when it is demanded at the earliest. Have to
say thanks to Vamsee and friends for helping me out.

Thanking you,

Yum should have an option wherein it lists all the files which got
installed for a package. For debian based system that would be 'dpkg
-L <package>'

ipsec command should work if your openswan installation was succesful.

hey,

iam trying to build a web service. I tht i ss hd take a quick response
from the community in choosing the technology. The project demands a
good UI (planing to rope in ajax) and has  pretty complex
datastructures to work with in the back end. The performance is also
critical as its  traffic is going to be a bit high. which
technology/framework/language would be best  for developing such an
application.

Two popular languages used for web development right now are Python and Ruby.

There are numerous frameworks for Python like web.py, turbogears,
django, pylons, etc.
I prefer web.py as it 'doesn't get into your way'. the most simplest
of all frameworks that python world has to offer.

If you want to go for Ruby, Ruby on Rails is the most popular over
there. It has got one nice feature 'scaffolding' where a single
command creates all the necessary code for your controller with all
the basic actions like new, edit, delete, view, etc.
It is from the Basecamp people and many websites use Rails.

I am trying to see how good is Pylons. It has got all the good things
from perl, python, and rails.

web.py - http://webpy.org/
Pylons - http://pylonshq.com/
Turbogears - http://www.turbogears.org/
Django - http://www.djangoproject.com/
Ruby on Rails - http://www.rubyonrails.org/

As a matter of fact, there is a window manager written in Emacs already :)

http://www.xwem.org/

That builds on an Xlib implementation in Emacs Lisp.. thats only for
TCP though... (with Emacs 22.0.50, I guess we could port it for an
UNIX socket as well ;) )

it moves on...

Perhaps scaffolding is not the best feature of Rails - it is a nice
thing to play with when you are initially prototyping your webapp - but
you always end up re-writing all your scaffolding code anyways. The most
compelling feature might be what you can call 'best-practices built-in'
- database migrations (one of my favorites), convention over
configuration, DRY (do not repeat yourself) etc. There's a whole
philosophy behind the Rails way ;-) (and obviously, a whole new industry
to make money off it).

If you're seriously evaluating Rails, then you might want to talk to
some of the folks here:

http://groups.google.com/group/chennairb

(you will be surprised at how many startups in Chennai are doing Rails
work - they might have some war stories to share).

Otherwise, I like the philosophy of web.py - it doesn't hurt that it was
written by one of Reddit's founders, Aaron Swartz (and Reddit itself
runs on it). Definitely worth a try.

Cool.  Looks like google is yet to hear about srs. Ever since I got a 
gmail id, I have had the pleasure of receiving tons of bytes of spam 
(majority of which google "filters" for me and saves them neatly in a 
Spam folder for 30 days that I can search, mark or delete  if I want to.) 

Additionally gmail also delivers mails addressed to ramson@gmail.com, 
ramanuja.g@gmail.com and a host of ram*@gmail.com addresses to me, 
probably using its "patented" "PigeonRank Technology" :) I am not sure 
if I should classify these as spam or as misdirected deliveries or both.

"Spam" originally meant "finely chopped cooked meat that has been 
pressed together in a container, usually sold in cans and served cold in 
slices" (OALD).  That changed with:

<quote>
The same Senate Report recounts the origin of the term "spam," 
explaining "'it all started in early Internet chat rooms and interactive 
fantasy games where someone repeating the same sentence or comment was 
said to be making a 'spam'. The term referred to a Monty Python's Flying 
Circus scene in which actors keep saying 'Spam, Spam, Spam, and Spam' 
when reading options from a menu.'" S. Rep. No. 108-102, at n.l (quoting 
April 5, 1999 edition of Computerworld).
</quote> (source: http://www.spamlaws.com/cases/whitebuffalo.shtml)

"Repeating the same sentence or comment" is a sure sign of having lost 
an argument, and those good there would hardly stop at anything else. 
Naturally, spam has managed to maintain its original meaty flavour.  
Ever since US passed the CAN SPAM law (one cannot miss the message in 
bold there) spammers have been seen suing Universities who were blocking 
their uce's which is technically not the same as anything else.  CAN 
SPAM and many others like to say officially you cannot spam, but the 
emerging position appears to be: [1] At most places, right to spam is 
subject to reasonable restrictions [2] The right to block spam is 
recognized. That makes enough room for all :)

Well it goes to your spam folder so they're doing something right there

What we do is to bounce (or rather smtp 550 reject at our gateway) any
spam that we detect

You heard of bcc?  Spammers often do that - insert one address from
their list into the cc and then bcc the rest

First and foremost - characters have to be available as Unicode data. 
Tamil is currently at a Level-2 implementation of the Unicode standard, 
and making it a Level-1 standard so that every character has a unique 
code should be the top priority.

Next, we could use any UTF to represent that data. UTF-8 appears to be 
emerging as the defacto standard for character encoding, because of its 
ability to efficiently encode using 1, 2, 3 or 4 bytes. UTF-16 is used 
by java and windows - may be it would be around, but UTF is only about 
the implementation and http://www.unicode.org/unicode/faq/utf_bom.html 
gives a detailed picture about the comparative advantage of using each.

http://www.utf-8.com/ gives links to a number of or resources for 
developers.

Since the main concern now is to see to it that Unicode includes all 
Tamil characters, it would be necessary to make a list of them first, 
and then see how it could be made to relate well both internally and 
with other languages.

The most unique thing about Tamil may be its affinity with mathematics. 
There are specific names and symbols for a number of fractions from 1/2 
to immi with surprising octet connections with a huge number of them in 
the series 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 to 1/320 and less. AFAIK, fractions are 
poorly represented in the computing field even today, and making room 
for these characters should be interesting and useful.

A number of old works on Tamil grammar are in the public domain, and if 
any attempt is made to publish it online (without gifs or other image 
files to represent characters), it would immediately expose the full set 
of Tamil characters that need to be sent to Unicode.

I'll ask the FSF people about what needs to be done in this regard. I 
found emacs and texmacs to ignore scim and appears unicode is not part 
of the standard releases yet. These things seem to be evolving rather 
slowly, and there is certainly no need to rush here.

The TUV doc talks about the 16 bit encoding plan that it has made. Is it 
available online ? I could not locate it.

First you have to select with either Python or Ruby to have as the base 
language. I do not have much idea about Ruby, other than something about 
Ruby on Rails. But, I work in Django. Python is easier to learn, 
documentation is fantastic and you have a very good community.

Django, again has a fantastic documentation and tutorial. Even a Django 
book is being written. Has a very good community on IRC and google 
groups. Being Python based, it is very powerful in terms of the 
language. Makes it easy to create database using models ,and your 
database, python code or logic and the template/presentation layer is 
loosely coupled so that you gain more flexibility in handling each of 
them. It is well suited for faster production and deployment.

The best suggestion will be to select a few options and try a pilot 
module on them. Whichever seems to be more comfortable to you and whose 
results are more satisfactory can be taken up for the main project :)

The most popular programming/scripting language best suited for the web 
is PHP.

Since your application might use a lot of exchanges back-and-forth 
between the browser and the web server (for AJAX) you can use JSON as 
the data interchange format.

Many high volume traffic web sites including Yahoo! are powered by PHP.

Rasmus Lerdorf, the creator of PHP, is here for FOSS.in and would be 
giving a talk on PHP5, you can put forth your questions to him.

A new page has been created for the purpose. I have added the basic 
details about beryl-project, but in english. I added a few lines in 
thamizh but could not proceed. If some one can translate or write the 
same in thamizh it would be nice.

Please have a look at

Are you in Chennai ?

Btw, are you intending to use 6.10 for production machines. I and many 
of the Ubunteros will advice to continue using Dapper Drake aka Ubuntu 
6.06, especially  on production machines. This also holds true for first 
time users and people who would not be ready to face challenges 
during/after installation. If you just want to have an experience with 
edgy, then ok. Else, please carry on with Dapper drake.

I've added the relevant links from the story as footnotes

Ubuntu to add proprietary drivers
Nov. 17, 2006

Analysis -- Reluctantly, the Ubuntu developer community has decided that
with the next version of Ubuntu, Feisty Fawn, it will be including some
proprietary drivers. Feisty Fawn's emphasis on "multimedia enablement"
appears to be the culprit.

Feisty Fawn, aka Ubuntu 7.04, is scheduled for release on Apr. 19, 2007.
According to Mark Shuttleworth, Ubuntu's founder, "The main themes for
feature development in this release will be improvements to hardware
support in the laptop, desktop and high-end server market, and
aggressive adoption of emerging desktop technologies. Ubuntu's Feisty
release will put the spotlight on multimedia enablement and desktop
effects."

To accomplish, the Ubuntu developer community has decided that it must
use, for now at least, proprietary drivers.

It's not that Ubuntu's developers like proprietary drivers. The
developers felt [1] that given that, "A large proportion of people using
Ubuntu -- including 70%-80% of people with new computers -- need a
non-Free driver for reasonable performance from their graphics card,
wireless card, or modem, because there is no Free driver available, they
had little choice in the matter.

In particular, the Ubuntu developers are working on adding binary ATI
and NVIDA graphic card drivers to the distribution. This is because,
"Currently, Ubuntu does little to enable 3D acceleration [2] on cards
that support these features. Composite support is enabled by default on
X.Org since Ubuntu Edgy, but various video boards need specific options
to support either Composite or 3D acceleration correctly, or have them
explicitly disabled, in case these technologies are not supported."

So it is that Ubuntu has "chosen to install non-Free drivers by
default." Specifically, it has been decided that "Both NVIDIA and ATI
proprietary drivers will be installed by default, on Ubuntu Feisty."
That does not mean, however, that they will be enabled for all video
boards. For example, since ATI proprietary drivers do not support
Composite graphics, this "driver will only be enabled by default for
users whose video boards are not supported by the open source 'ati'
video driver."

In addition, work has started on bringing proprietary drivers into
Ubuntu for the so-called Win-modems (fritz isdn/dsl modules, lt-modem)
and the Atheros (ath_hal aka madwifi) and Intel 3945 Intel wireless
chipsets.

The developers are well aware of the problems with using these drivers.
For example, there are the simple technical problems that support for
the drivers is completely dependent on the hardware vendor. And, then,
when the vendor does make a bug fix, that "improvement" will require
careful testing, since the developers won't know what was changed in the
update. Of course, on top of that, there are the philosophical
objections to using binary drivers in Linux.

Many public comments about this decision object to Ubuntu's decision.
One writer [3] said, "We should not give up our freedom for a short term
advantage."

A public poll [4], on the Ubuntu forums, however, reveals far less
outrage and far more desktop pragmatism. As of the evening of Nov. 17,
on the question, "Should binary NVidia/ATI drivers be automatically
installed & activated in Ubuntu?," the answers were:

    * 32.62 percent -- "Yes, while informing the user of the relevant
issues, etc."
    * 54.63 percent -- "Users should be given a choice about this during
installation"
    * and only 12.75 percent voted for "No, such drivers can stay in a
non-free repo, just like now"

In any case, Ubuntu is moving forward with incorporating proprietary
drivers. At the same time, though, Ubuntu will be trying to educate
users about the issues around non-free drivers. The plan, now, is for
this to be done by "using a notification bubble on login, an extra
section in the Device Manager, and a CGI script on Ubuntu.com for
providing up-to-date information about alternative hardware."

Thus the goal is that while Ubuntu will be shipping "proprietary drivers
in the short term, we should take steps to improve the situation in the
long term. We believe the best way to do this is to convey the problem
to people using Ubuntu - explaining why we distribute non-Free drivers
at all, what the risks are, and what people can do to avoid such
hardware in future."

Hi,

I had downloaded w32codecs and was able to play .wmv files.  But when I 
logged in today, I am getting a message "mplayer not running" when I run 
a .wmv file.  Am I missing something?   Any pointer would be helpful.

Also how do you run windows media player content through firefox? When I 
try installing the missing plugin it is taking me to Microsoft site.

I am trying to play kmplayer from firefox.  Got this url 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71239  I am 
getting compilation errors when I try to compile it from source.  

Think if I am able to resolve the mplayer issues I am having I should be 
able to play windows media content...

1. Inconvenience regretted if this gets top posted as im not sure if
google handles it the same way on a less featured mobile as it does on
web.
2. Ramanraj's question made me ask something on the same lines. So,
does gmail deliver a genuine mail to ram[someone]@gmail to RamanRaj as
spam?
/cw
Conserve Internet; Transfer less?

Apologies for top posting :)

Personally, I would prefer to block bcc messages.  Since the mail 
transfer protocols seem to allow implicit addresses, it may not be easy 
to distinguish bcc from others.  Mailman handles bcc posts to the list 
correctly! I sent the text quoted below the quoted text as *bcc* to the 
list, and the response I got was:

<quote>
Your mail to 'ilugc' with the subject
    Re: [Ilugc] [OT] Suresh on news.com
Is being held until the list moderator can review it for approval.
The reason it is being held:
    Message has implicit destination
Either the message will get posted to the list, or you will receive
notification of the moderator's decision.  If you would like to cancel

Oops! You guys are going off on a completely different track!

Suresh should correct me but this is how I read things.

Firstly gmail's spam filtering is not representative of the current zeitgeist in spam filtering. Well gmail does a pretty good job but that does not mean that we should learn about spam control only from gmail. :)

Now, mailman has nothing to do with this. Mailman can be configured to either allow unregistered mail ids to post or disallow.

ILUGC disallows and hence Ramanraj's mail got rejected. Whether it is in bcc or CC or To does not matter.

Let us focus on spam filtering now.

If you were gmail how would you know if a mail addressed to ram@gmail.com is not addressed to Ramanraj as well?

Heck, what has the mistyping of e-mail IDs got to do with this?

Nothing. 

If the address is in bcc the mail will come.

Spam filtering happens mostly in the body in these cases.

It looks at the content rather than the headers.

Header based spam filtering happens during mail delivery and acceptance.

So if the body is not suspect or if Bayesian and Markovian filtering does not throw up high scores mail is delivered.

Just wait for my slides for the gory details. I shall send them tomorrow. ;)

Girish

As far as I can see, gmail was delivering spam with a to: of
ram*@gmail.com to ramanraj's spam folder - because ramanraj's been bcc'd
on that email.

In Rails the add/mod/view/delete module are mapped from the db, Meaning have
a db & table mapping enables to  generate the code.It makes more sense of a
database centric style of coding

I dont know whether such features are there in vb?. if any, kindly let me
know

ruby on rails is good. not just because of scaffolding, rails reduces
lots of repeated code and improves your productivity

Your keyboard is set to en_GB. Change it to en_US? I think
redhat-config-keyboard or something is the program to use.

fyi, you dont need native codecs to play asf files with wmv content
(that's what you meant by wmv files :) ). afaicr, mplayer's codec
library, ffmpeg, handles it...

it moves on...

Hi Luggies,

Can you suggest any open source online collaboration tool for distributed
software development (Like Documentum's Eroom)?
With features like Document Management, Project Planning, Version Control,
Instant messaging, dashboard etc.

Hi,

I have updated http://freeshell.in/~ramanraj/ with a couple of short 
stories that make use of unicode Tamil encoding.
[1] ????? http://freeshell.in/~ramanraj/arivu.pdf
[2] ????? ????????? ???????? 
http://freeshell.in/~ramanraj/arivu_good_or_bad.pdf

The short stories are styled after typical Tamil magazine fare.  ????? - 
"Arivu" - means "sense" in Tamil, and  a common name among Tamils.  The 
first story is actually a very short HOWTO install gNewSense distro on a 
new system.  There are only three characters - Arivu, our hero, his 
friend Kalai (means "art") and Kumar - the "kid" who fancies proprietary 
software.  ????? ????????? ????????  is about the anxiety of Arivu to 
share information about his new system with a nearby school. I am 
working on splitting it into two stories to avoid crowding and focus 
more on the content relating to free software. ????? ????????? based on 
explaining things about the Wikipedia is on the way.  Ultimately, if 
enough number of Arivu stories get written, it could be compiled into 
Arivayanam - The journey of Arivu :)

For running Eclipse a minimum of 512 MB RAM is required. 1GB would be ideal.

Nope. I am running eclipse with 256M RAM. It will be slow if you also
have some J2EE containers along. I run eclipse with tomcat run as and
when needed!

Subject: [Ilugc] Great tip for avoiding spelling mistakes in vim
Message-ID: <20061121093446.GA8887@lakshmi.susmita.org>

Hi brothers and sisters,
   
   I chanced upon an excellent idea to avoid typos in emails.

   Typos give a very bad impression about us and I usually find that I make typos due to keyboard sensitivity problem or speed of typing though I do sometimes misspell too.

   This works only if you are using vim+mutt. :)

   So please gmail web users and emacs users excuse me.

   Though I have several ways by which I can invoke spell checking inside vim or mutt, I still prefer runtime highlighting ala MS Word.
   
   This is what you have to do for that.

   Just drop this line in your ~/.vimrc.

   :setl spell spelllang=en_us

   And now onwards you can easily sound erudite and impeccable. 

   What to speak of the wonders of modern technology?

   (Of course there are so many mistakes this thing can't catch, no substitute to "sraddha" of course :)

love,
Girish

well, for those using gnus (emacs), there's `M-x flyspell-mode' in ur
mail buffer.. (if u want it turned on by default, customize the
variable flyspell-mode)... highlights mispellings, and allows u to
correct them with a context menu at the point :)

it moves on...

There seem to be others too , I had downloaded a spell.vim file.

The idea is not being able to check spelling, I know that gmail has that.

But it is that of showing misspelt words in a non obtrusive but at the same time useful manner.

If you have to click the "check spelling" link every time , then if you are like me you might forget.

I remember clearly mentioning in my mail that I know several ways to invoke it from both vim and mutt.

The idea is not being able to do it but forcing you to do it. :)

To me at least that makes all the difference...

Anyway thanks for all the inputs. 

regards,
Girish

You need to write a small shell script to start and run ur daemon.. This
shell script must be putted in /etc/init.d/ and then soft link
/etc/init.d/<ur-script> to the prefered runlevels in /etc/rc.d/runlevels.

Refer already existing scripts in /etc/init.d for creating an advanced
startup script..


  Anyway I would like to know how do i configure my system such that the

/etc/profile is used for user-level startup programs (executed after user
logins). As u said, it is a daemon, this may not apply to ur case.

That is a hardware limitation. Flash memory has a
finite number of erase-write cycles.

The only thing you can do in software is use
power-management and suspend the card. But, that
doesn't nullify the hardware limitation.

Then I should say you are really patient. Running Eclipse and Tomcat
with 256MB RAM used to make me amazingly profane ;-)

Hey,
	I don't get your question.

	You are asking about flash file systems and stuff.. or how to do it?

	It is taken care of automagically by file systems like JFFS2 or YFFS.

	google for them.

	Most estimates on life getting over and all that are bogus.

	If you use the right file system it will last long enough.

	At least considering the failure rates of hard disk these days, I think it is  mostly a non issue.

	Another thing. Please don't run swap on NOR flash.

	Use ramdisk...

	Best,

KM,

	I fail to get you. I thought spell checking came with stock vim. I wonder which version though.

	How do you use the plug in you refer to?

	Can you please elaborate?

Please don't give incorrect information. 

Most flash memories will fail after 100,000 read/write
cycles.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory

Choosing an appropriate flash filesystem that can
handle read/writes effectively can only optimize the
minimum number of read/writes, thereby extending the
use.

"The life of the device depends on the number of erase
cycles guaranteed by the flash vendor, and the
frequency with which each specific group of sectors is
updated."

http://www.mil-embedded.com/articles/authors/spanjer/

> Y wud u have a ramdisk on embedded systems?

If you don't want the user to screw up the flash or
when you don't have secondary storage other than
flash, you want to use a ramdisk mounted in RAM as a
filesystem.

That might be the case when you have only Eclipse running. If there
are any other apps running (browser, mail client, any open documents
etc) besides it, the system will come to a crawl if you frequently
switch between apps.

Very much so. This relieves the flash from being used for writes of 
temporary data (not required across reboots)

This enables the feature of being able to change configs and revert back 
to original by reboot if the config not committed. A very common 
expectation, deliverable and method in embedded systems. If one were to 
do this on flash, complex config rollback systems have to be built.

I don't want to shift my stance.

What you are talking is theory. In practice hard disks fail with time.

If you choose the right file systems and use flash memory it will not fail.

No need to be paranoid, that is what I meant.

My information was neither incorrect nor misleading.

What you are saying is like, even if an ethernet cable
gets cut somewhere in the middle, the TCP/IP packets
will still flow through it. Software depends/runs on
hardware. 

Filesystem is software. Flash memory is hardware.
Irrespective of what filesystem or software you use,
after 100,000 read/write cycles flash memory _will_
fail. Period.

You can use a hardware debugger like Lauterbach to
restore the flash images back to the NOR flash through
JTAG.

I was referring to vim version 6.x  which one needs to place the plug in in a dir as mentioned above.

just put the plugin(vimspell.vim) at specified location (~/.vim/plugin)and relogin into the shell.

load a document in vim and check :help vimspell for options
'Esc followed by \ key press and  ss' will spell check the current document.

For Vim 7.x onwards spellcheck comes with stock vim.

Tools can't improve the life of a flash but there are best practices
you can follow to improve the overall lifetime. All hardwares are
expected to fail one day and for flash with limited number of
write/erase cycle bad planning can cause premature demise of the
product:
- Use file systems specifically designed for flash, like JFFS2 - they
distribute write cycles and manage the available space in a better way
than with other file systems.
- NOR chips are XIP capable and can be mapped to be the boot device,
in which case, the first few sectors are used for bootup making them
critical and should not be often erased - You can implement modular
bootup - have a very small and very robust 0th stage boot loader at
the first few sectors. The only job of this stage will be to bootstrap
the 1st stage loader. you can deploy redundant 1st stage loaders.
- You can partition your flash and have different filesystems on them.
For eg: the firmware can be on cramfs and the configurations on jffs2.

Hi,
Got a Huawei SMART AX 841 modem from BSNL. For the
wireless part, it comes with a pcmcia card that fits
into the modem.

 Does anyone know the range of the wireless net
provided by the card (this is also a Huawei make and
is intended to be an add on for the modem)?

Thanks in advance.

Sanjay

Sanjay,

	I was given to understand that things like wireless range are actually stipulated by the protocol in question, in this case I believe it is 802.11x.

	Only if wireless device vendors like Hwawei adhere to those standards they will be released into the market.

	There may be other factors in the equation but...

	You should be able to test the range easily , can't you?

	And in wireless if you increase the distance, throughput will reduce, so it does not make much sense to approach theoretical limits.

	Or did I misunderstand your query?

I was referring to daily field use here. I did build a system with

I don't remember what I did with eclipse running all alone! All I did
with eclipse was some servlet related work deployed onto tomcat and
occasionally run in a browser to verify if it is all right.  Now this
requires that you have eclipse, tomcat and at least one web browser
running simultaneously.

There are some things you can do. There is a browser that can run from
within eclipse. This browser may not do flash and video but can do all
that a servlet needs to show! In fact now I am running eclipse, laszlo
presentation server and firefox 2.0 all side by side and only now am I
seeing real crawls.

Hello,

Has anyone successfully printed from Linux to an HP DeskJet D2360, with 
or without HPLIP?

In either case, CUPS shows the print job as having completed 
successfully but the printer doesn't print anything.

(Printer works fine with Windows, so it is not a printer issue.)

FC5, kernel 2.6.18, CUPS 1.2.6, HPLIP 1.6.6a.

For configuration, log files, etc, see my post to the CUPS list:

Thanks.

Checking out with the HP website for Printer Product Overview, the 
product is said to be compatible with Win and Mac. This is the reason 
your printer is said to be working with Win (availability of driver 
support in the corresponding web site).

http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/store_access.do?template_type=product_detail&product_code=C9079A%23B1H&jumpid=oc_R1002_USENC-001_HP%20Deskjet%20D2360%20Printer&lang=en&cc=us

But, am afraid it was the same for printers which I had worked with 
GNU/Linux.

Even my now obsolete 3325 Deskjet doesn't have GNU/Linux driver support 
in the HP web site, but I have no problem in using it in both my Laptop 
(Ubunty Dapper/Edgy) as well as my home system, FC4 and Kubuntu.

You can try with some generic drivers or the closest HP driver available 
in your system. I have run printers satisfactorily with generic drivers, 
especially those printers from TVS. So, HP shouldn't be a problem.

Parthan,

Thank you for your response.

Actually, HP does have printer support for Linux.  Take a look at:

http://h71028.www7.hp.com/enterprise/cache/321119-0-0-0-121.html?jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN

(I hope this URL is persistent.)

HPLIP [1] is sponsored by HP.  And LinuxPrinting.org states that the 
D2300 series is ``mostly supported'' by HPIJS and HPLIP [2].  I presume 
this means that something can be printed from Linux to this printer.

[1] http://hplip.sourceforge.net
[2] http://linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=HP-DeskJet_D2300

The problem seems to be that the OS and the application think that the 
print job completed successfully, but the printer does nothing.

The easiest way to verify if you need more ram or not is to check your
swap usage , with and without the software under testing -- eclipse in
your case -- if more swap space or any at is being used , its
definitely a sign that you need more ram.

And webservers also need to be optimized to uses less ram , I had an
issue where once 25 instances of apache was running , checked using ps
aux | grep apache  ,
and each was taking around 1.4% mem . tweaking the serverfreed a lot of memory.

Genreally rule of thumb is , if swap space used is more than a few
Mb(on regualr desktops) , you need more ram.

Dont set anything outside 10/8, 192.168/16 and 172.16/12 on your LAN

What did you try that doesnt work properly. Please be specific

And renumber your LAN so that the 197.whatever is 10.1.whatever, or
192.168.2.whatever

Packets that come from router to Linux eth0 will not have 61.17.191.15 
as destination IP. You'll need to do the DNAT on the router and not the 
Linux box. Also the router must have a route to that host if it is not 
in the subnet of te internal interface of the router.

In case you want to retain the flexibility of maintaining it on the 
Linux box, DNAT on router to Linux eth0 IP and on Linux box DNAT to the 
internal LAN m/c IP. Then the route may (if not in the same subnet as 
any of the interfaces) neeeded on the Linux box and not the router.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0611212112440.24222@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,
About 13 months back I bought a Laptop(Dell Inspiron 6000).
It had been using the cutom installed Windows XP (home edition).
It has the Samsung MP0603H harddisk.

Around 6 months ago, I wanted to experiement with various distributions of
Linux. I had only the single partion(factory made) and therefore I did not
want to lose data/disturb windows. So I used systemRescue CD(dowloaded
from internet) to resize the existing C: and created my own partions and
installed Linux. Things were working fine.

Around 20 days ago, I wanted to resize the partitions So, I used
SystemRescue CD again. While it was deleting a partion(I have chosen to do
it), I accidentally rebooted it. From then on my harddisk is showing bad
sectors and the number of bad sectors grow day by day.

This is shown by chkdsk command in windows.

I am not too technical savvy to identify if it is a software
problem(Unknowingly/for some weired reason it is marking as bad sector) OR
really the disk itself had physically gone bad.

If any one knows any solution to rectify the problem(Removing the bad
sectors - if it is a software problem) please let me know. I do not like
the temporary fix of keep on marking more and more bad sectors and
continue working till it totally crashes one day.

Since the warranty got over just a month ago I dont think Dell will repair
or replace my hard disk. I saw the web site of Samsung for hard disk. It
also shows the warranty is for one year only.

Any suggestion/advice is most welcome.

P.S: It is a technical problem, so please dont say throw up windows Or
start flame wars. I have become allergic to the smoke of these flame
wars nowadays. ;)
Also I dont like to buy a new hard disk if there is some
way to resolve the present harddisk technical problem.

Thanks & Regards,
carti

Does samsung provide you with a low-level formatting tool? something
like seagate provides?

But while you can., take back up of all your data to some other machine.
It'll save you a lot of sleepless nights.

Boot from Ubuntu Live CD. Check how the partitions appear... U can do this
just by choosing the installing options and proceeding till step 4.. i
believe...

May not be the exact technical solution.. but it might help...

  Well. i made a script file called 'a' and placed it in /etc/init.d. What do you meant by softlink /etc/init.d to the preferred runlevels in /etc/rc.d/runlevels.

Hi all!

I got a broadband connection yesterday. But actually i am not at least
satisfied with that`s speed. My speed is 10Mbps. How can boost up my
browsing speed and also download speed? I think there are some hackers here
in this group.

10 mbps is the speed between your PC's ethernet cable and the broadband
router.

If you get a 256k broadband connection, that's the maximum speed (you'd
get an average 18..20 kbps download speed with that one)

Bad sectors mean your hard disk is dying / dead.

There are several ways by which to recover your data but if I were you I will trash the disk and buy a spanking new SATA...

Believe me SATA is really really fast and cool.

Did you know that hard disk performance determines your general responsiveness?

Zico,

	Why are you not satisfied? Your speed is mostly dependent on the quality of your phone line. 

	You can eliminate software bottlenecks but not work around basic laws of physics...

	So first figure out what speed you deserve and see if you are getting it. If not call up the service provider and bug them.

	I am very satisfied with the speed I get, so I have not researched into caching and other forms of web acceleration.

	For me stability of the link is more important.

	ADSL is rock solid. No two ways about it.

	In the recent rains and storm or whatever I had power problem, but never an Internet outage!

	Kudos to BSNL! :)

regards,
Girish

You know something?  A laptop hard disk can get really costly.

The guy should have immediately got himself an AMC or warranty extension
(and if he can convince the dealer to give him an AMC even now that
should be fine - just get the laptop to boot up and run without hassles
for once when the company's engineer is there to "evaluate" the laptop)

you can always insure your laptop - it is just 2% (when i last  
looked) per year. You can also insure your other equipment once the  
warranty is over. Insurance of hardware is cheap - it is only  
insurance against data loss that is expensive.

You can use ln which is a command to make links between files, for
further details you can refer the man page of ln.

man ln

Sorry for responding to myself, but I thought others would be interested 
in the resolution.

I worked with Aaron Albright of the HPLIP team on this issue.  Turns out 
that the CUPS web interface that I had used to configure the printer 
used a PPD file that did not correspond to the printer.  The correct 
file was missing on my FC5 system.  Not sure why.

I downloaded the correct PPD file from linuxprinting.org, deleted all 
print queues, and used the downloaded PPD file to configure the printer 
using the HPLIP hp-setup utility.  It started working fine after that.

Thanks.

I suggested both postgre & mysql...

But the existing application uses Oracle.. some how our ppl got convinced to
shift the OS to Ubuntu..

It will be a nice break through.. and will be first of its kind at our
centre..

Well I guess its a bit late now.The online registration should have been
closed by yesterday
(as per the foss.in mailing list). Still you could pay Rs1000 and register
urself on the spot at the venue on 24th.

I'm not too sure on this, but then tagging the subject with COMMERCIAL 
since Oracle isn't free software[1].

I've installed Oracle 10g Express Edition on my laptop running Ubuntu, 
the installation is pretty straight-forward (sudo dpkg -i).  There are a 
whole bunch of docs on setting up and configuring Oracle on their 
developer web site.

Now for the question that Kenneth asked, any reasons for choosing Oracle 
over PostgreSQL or MySQL 5.x?

Read sed(1)

Basically when it finds backslash (\) at the end of the line, reads the 
next line (the N does that), and deletes the backslash from input.

Also, for any occurrence of "th width" in input, the entire line is deleted.

To be more clear, the following input:

this is line 1 \
this is another line
this is a line containing "th input"

would produce:

this is line 1 this is another line

A [commercial] tag is used when a post commercial intent and not because

Which bb connection are u using?
I have bsnl bb and it works fine.
During downloads I get around 28-31 kbps speed.
A CD image of around 700 MB is downloaded in about 7 hours.

Normally I use aria or d4x as my download manager.

probably some option like swcursor / hwcursor etc?

better try reconfiguring X a bit ..

X -configure > /root/xorg.conf

Compare that with your current xorg.conf and make appropriate changes,
add in higher resolutions that your video card supports etc.

Update on Hacker's dictionary:

Over 100 words have been added to Hacker's dictionary. Thanks to the
wiktionary discussion forum.

Except for few English alphabets, all other have got entries to the Hacker's
dictionary.

to view list of words and their equivalent tamil words.. say "P"

http://nrcfosshelpline.in/Suzhi/P

Some of these words may not replicate the exact meaning of the English word,
but some may even convey the meaning better than the English term :-) bear
and help us improving this cause...

Subject: [Ilugc] Internet through TATA Indicom dial-up
Message-ID: <001d01c70f96$4255d1a0$4400a8c0@ganesh>

Hi All,

I am relatively new to Linux

I am unable to browse using tata-indicom dial-up connection in my linux box

I am on debian 3.1 and using LG LSP 340E handset with serial interface cable
connected to /dev/ttyS0. I am logged in as root.

Initially tried the following script for connecting
------------8><--------------------
#!/bin/bash
echo "user internet password internet" > $HOME/.ppprc
pppd /dev/ttyS0 115200 debug usepeerdns defaultroute noauth connect
'/usr/sbin/chat -v "" at+crm=1 OK "atdt#777" CONNECT' mtu 264
------------8><--------------------

and this for disconnecting :

------------8><--------------------
#!/bin/bash
killall -9 pppd
------------8><--------------------

The connection goes through as can be seen on the phone display (Tx-9.6
Rx-9.6 etc), but the browsers (Firefox 2.0 and konqueror) say page not found
for any page I try to access. Disconnection script works.

I harvested the DNS entries from my windows box (203.197.12.30 and
202.54.6.50) and entered them in /etc/resolv.conf. However when the
connection goes through the values get overwritten with 203.197.12.30 and
202.54.1.18

ifconfig -a gives the following (apart from entries for eth0 and loopback)

------------8><--------------------
ppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol
          inet addr:219.64.64.25  P-t-P:172.23.128.87  Mask:255.255.255.255
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:264  Metric:1
          RX packets:7 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:6 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0
          RX bytes:164 (164.0 b)  TX bytes:107 (107.0 b)
------------8><--------------------

Then I installed wvdial and invoked it after adding the following section in
/etc/wvdial.conf
------------8><--------------------
[Dialer tata]
Modem = /dev/ttyS0
Baud = 115200
SetVolume=0
Dial Command = ATDT
Init1 = ATZ
Init2 = AT+CRM=1L3
FlowControl = Hardware (CRTSCTS)
ISDN = 0
Phone = #777
Username = internet
Password = internet
Stupid Mode = 1
------------8><--------------------

Then even the connection is not going through

Kindly help.

P.S : Sorry for the looooooooong post.

Regards Ganesh

Your speed is 10Mbps between your PC and the broadband router, but
beyond the router it is only what you have signed up for (64kbps? 128
kbps? whatever).

If you are using Firefox, I can suggest two extensions that will
improve your online experience considerably:

- Fasterfox. Tunes certain Firefox configuration settings to improve downloading
- Adblock. Lets you selectively disable portions of websites (mainly
for ads, especially flash ads etc.). It will take time to  build your
own block list, but there are several pre-built block lists available.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0611240139500.4787@chi.spunge.org>

Hi all,
thank you very much for the suggestions given.

I somehow resolved the bad sector problem.

What I did was,
I used the same SystemRescue CD and deleted all the partitions(ntfs,
fat32 and ext3). Then created the ntfs partitions and linux partitions
using the SystemRescue CD. Then formatted those partitions using the same
SystemRecue CD. Then installed the Windows XP and the Ubuntu linux 5.10
(Dual boot).

Now the SamSung MP0603H 60 GB Harddisk seems to work fine. When I
installed Windows, and when it ran scandisk I guess it thoroughly checked
for bad sectors. It did not report to have any bad sectors. Same is the
case with Linux. It also did not report any bad sectors.

So Hopefully those were not really bad sectors and only a software
problem/mis-understanding of windows of what SystemRescue did when I
accidentally rebooted when systemRescue was working.

Hope this helps some one at sometime.

Thanks & regards

Hi,

Use rconnect dialer from Reliance. It works very well with Tata Indicom 
dial-up.

It never worked for me. You are right "it will take time" but I think it takes effort on your part too rite?

What am I supposed to do to make those annoying yahoo! animations go away?

I have been a long time fan of John Walker's http://fourmilab.ch site. 
When I recently checked it, a few new pages had come up:
[1] The funniest thing I have read in recent times is about this source 
of "corruption":
http://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/corrupted_downloads/
[2] John Walker has released the source code for the "Home Planet"  
program (VC++).  This program is in the public domain, and if anyone 
could release a suitable Gnu/Linux version of it, that would be nice.  
The windows binaries of Home Planet  released and found at the site 
could be used with wine. More info at http://www.fourmilab.ch/homeplanet/

Hai what abt console based browsers like lynx and links. Opera also
will do u can block all the pics and graphics that u don want. For
downloads u can use wget and curl. If u want to know abt ur current
speed and utilization u can use iptraf which will give u stats.

One can either work towards better security or write PHP code - not both.

do you claim companies like Yahoo!, HP, Deutsche Bank, Lucent
Technologies are not interested in security?

Don't top-post, please.

1. Console browsers like lynx and links do not support JavaScript - yet.
2. There is hardly any CSS support either.

Providing names of four PHP-using companies doesn't prove anything. I
can list several thousand companies out there which don't use PHP for
each name you throw in (at least, not in an obvious way). What does it
prove? Nothing.

And yes, it can be argued that these companies are not interested in
security. Or that they all have invested in sufficient manpower and
technology to offset the risks of using PHP. In either case, the
investment required to support a secure environment running PHP code
doesn't justify using the language for web application development.

If you argue this way I can argue nothing in computers or even life is
secure, *do nothing and be safe*.

Of course, that is indeed correct. Since such a way of life is not
practical, one tries to achieve the next best - and deploying PHP is a
step (several!) backwards in that process.

Interesting discussion. :)

php is considered one of the most screwed up languages by some...

And by many as the greatest thing since sliced bread.

I happen to belong to the former category.

No need to be upset. 

It has its ecological niche and I have nothing personal against it but I will avoid it whenever possible...

It is sure to be waiting for something or something is blocking it...

I can't guess anything more ATM.

Can you do an strace on its pid? Is it waiting on select?

If that is the case then you have to figure out more details...

What an idiot I am, thinking PHP is secure!!!. Can you please explain
what is secure and how PHP cannot meet it? by that way not just me but
everyone in here will benefit from your valuable comments or
suggestions.

Could this be any DNS resolving issue? may be proftpd trying to
reverse lookup client's IP probably for logging. This has happened to
me with SSHd without DNS server a long back.

Come on Binand I expect more from you not just a vulnerability list.
Linux kernel has bugs Mozilla Firefox has bugs Perl has, Java has...

The link you provided *mostly* lists vulnerabilities of web
application developed using PHP. Technically they belongs to those web
application not PHP.

it is a fact that to write a fairly secure web application with php  
you need an exceptionaly skilled programmer - and if you want proof  
of that, look at the websites of any php application and count the  
number of security alerts/patches. Compare with python applications -  
django, for example, does not have a security page at all and has had  
*one* minor security alert in the past 4 years. And this alert only  
affected about three svn revisions and not the released code, nor the  
svn trunk.

My dears,

       Every Language has its own merits and vulnerablities. There is
nothing to say it is so secured or not. It may be compromised at anytime. So
can you please stop this argument and give me a nice suggestion..?

Identifying vulnerabilities heavily depends on its usage and user
base. Where there are more users, more bugs identified, its
proportional my friend. How many of us in here knows/uses PHP and how
many of us in here knows/uses Python/Django a quick poll will do the
rest.

oh, so *that* is why windoze has more bugs than linux - more people  
use windoze. Strange, I always thought that the reason was something  
to do with the differing development model.

I did mention the link was a starting point. For comparison, PHP has
1943 matches, Perl has 101, Python 18 and Ruby 10.

Why is it that the vast majority of PHP applications have
vulnerabilities? For example, scan the PHP list - see how many "remote
file inclusion" vulnerabilities are there? Can you find any in Perl
programs? The reason for this is the vastly overdesigned PHP fopen()
function/allow_url_fopen. Or the myriad of problems associated with
register_globals. I can go on about this.

They are all depends on how you develop your web application. Most
modern PHP web applications are designed to work with register_globals
off Joomla warns the user if he have register_globals on now. I won't
claim all PHP web applications are safe and secure but they are
evolving like any other language or software. Numbers cannot always
tell the truth the keywork Linux fetches 759 vulnerability and Windows
fetch 781 so is Linux as vulnerable as Windows, as the difference is
not big?

Which is precisely my point. PHP as a language makes it easy for a run
of the mill programmer to write insecure applications. The language
has design features that encourages insecure programming - like
register_globals on, allow_url_fopen on etc.

It took close to 12 years to get PHP where it is now - with more than
its share of insecurities still present, and after overwhelming
criticism from various developer and security communities.

You might be right there. I won't claim Linux is very secure. My
Redhat-provided kernel include close to 400 patches - several of which
are security fixes. Try OpenBSD.

> known as an oxymoron
Really. Well maybe programming and security should be a oxymoron that
better explains it. You can create totally insecure webpages with most
other languages as well.

I am using most because there are quite a few languages about which I
have no clue. So you could come with some thing like lisp and say it
is secure. I can't comment.

It all depends on how well (or unwell) your container is configured.
After all PHP is a bunch of C code. (I know it because I ve written my
module for PHP). The main sources of insecurity is because of the way
we have chosen to program using PHP, and I guess is not a
_characteristic_ of PHP itself.

I know its off topic ,..... sorry
Just felt like i need to qoute it :)

There is nothing totally secure , thats why million dollar contests are held
to check if a system is breakable , and all the times there have been
someone.

But my personal opinion ,
Php is still handling issues with sql injection and other vulnerabilities.
So unless you know what you are doing and  want to keep your application
secure , stay away from php :)

And i wonder where comes an issue of security in an ldap browser ,
raja just asked for a ldap browser.(if there is anything related please do
let me know , I would like to learn).

try removing resolvconf (sudo apt-get remove resolvconf) and then adding
`nameserver 4.2.2.1
nameserver 4.2.2.2' (without quotes) to /etc/resolv.conf and try.

Best of Luck :-)

First you sit and learn patiently...

Then you will automatically start finding deficiencies in existing programs which the author missed and you can start.

I appreciate your enthusiasm. You should convert this into something useful by combination enthusiasm with patience. 

Coming to brass tacks I don't know what you asked but it should be easy to identify which domain or technology interests you.

You can take ubuntu or whichever you find lying around.

google for it and keep reading and browsing.

And thinking about it.

Then read the manual pages and if you feel like the source code of the programs related to that technology.

This will keep you occupied and perhaps make you wonder that you are wasting time.

But all will be well soon. :)

If you try to short circuit this process then it may lead to duplication of effort and perhaps rejection.

Of course this is no hard and fast rule, just my thought, that is all.

All the best!

Bad that  u got confused about what to do

Open Source is not specific to organizations. its about the
individuals interest.

It is good if you submit.

As a linux user, think of urself what is missing in using linux or any

You can directly edit the file
/etc/network/interfaces

to add something like ...

     iface eth0 inet static
     address 192.168.10.205
     netmask 255.255.255.0
     gateway 192.168.10.1
     auto eth0


After that do

     /etc/init.d/networking restart


then check whether

     ifconfig eth0

shows up correctly and check whether you
are able to ping your gateway.

BTW, who is your ISP?

do:
1. go to sourceforge.net
2. check the help wanted page
3. choose 2 or 3 projects
4. download, install and check them out - see if you are interested  
in joining the team
5. lurk on their mailing lists
6. write some code, patches, documentation
7. submit that
and, if you work hard, you may make the team

dont:
1. start talking on the mailing list the moment you join
2. demand commit rights before you submit anything
3. tell people that they chose the wrong language or the wrong  
development model

Log in to your dsl modem and set the correct dns server settings there

Or failing that .. look at /etc/network/interfaces, set this there

If you are using ext3 (by default i guess its ext3) , you cannot recover
deleted files.
If its ext2 , you can  try undelete , but
with rm -rf , dont even think about it .

A article i read about rm -rf
http://www.justpasha.org/folk/rm.html


Thats why the open source guys always say , never log in as root unless you
really have to :)

have fun

Always use your distro package manager to
install/update software, unless you know what you are
doing. From the command-line:

 apt-get update
 apt-cache search kernel

For GUI, you can use Synaptic Package Manager to do
the above.

Hai,

      try to edit your interface file ppp0 or ppp1 and change the value
peerdns=yes to Peerdns=no and check.
Actually  what was happening it was tried to get auto DNS from the modem. If
you want you can disable this by changing the above value and set your
static DNS entries in your resolv.conf file.

+1. The talk was simply awesome. I loved the slide which says "DISOBEY".
 Too bad I couldn't get a pic of that. But I did take pics of almost all
the slides and a bit of video. Will put that up soon and let you guys know.

Hi Gilbert,
  I am using a laptop. I cannot open the case to switch the IDE.  I am
using dual boot machine. The CD works fine in the other OS
unfortunately. I also posted the same message to Fedora devel groups. I
got a reply that said my cdrom is faulty. Let me know if there is any
other solution.

Or there could be scratches or dust or not written properly...

Try wiping the CD with some nice smooth cloth and also your drive.

Best of luck!

Google gave me this link. This may not solve your issue but we can get to
know little about what is really happening inside.

Message-ID: <ddd4b0590611270356m70c322c4h1efcba8ca03886a4@mail.gmail.com>

<quote>
The saviour (as always) was DTrace. We took the "One Universal
Application" - emacs, and did some basic Dtracing. We found that Emacs
tries to open the ~/.emacs configuration file once. *Even* if this
call fails, it proceeds to do *twenty* stat64() on *each of* .emacs,
.emacs.el, emacs.el.gz, .emacs.elc, .emacs.elc.gz ? That is 100
useless stat64() calls on a non existent file. Just imagine this when
your home directory is mounted over NFS! We then found the call stacks
calling the redundant stat functions. Alas, they don't ship Linux with
the useful CTF/Symbol Table Data that Solaris does. But then we
temproarily worked around the "problem" by touching ~/.emacs. DTrace
then showed that the one hundred stat64() calls were reduced to 3.

Wow ! 3 Minutes and 4 D-Scripts later, we had found that the most
popular Free/Open Source Software in the world wasn't written that
smartly. Just imagine the layers and layers of linux code written by
less able programmers and those seen by lesser eyes.

Alright, it's  a part of his name. Sorry for the dumb question.
Thaths with quotes makes me read "Thaths of Google" as the theme of
the talk. And it sounds like some sort of Old English word.

Thanks Parthan

I think you know what I am going to say. :)

OpenBSD is one of the most excellently supported operating system on laptops.

Its speed and performance will baffle you.

But it has no 3D, no non redistributable binary blobs and few other luxuries.

I have zero exposure to laptops but I hear this from multiple quarters.

If you can bring the laptop to my home I will get it up and running. :)

With the fish of course...

Girish

Bluetooth is not built in but I use a cheat dongle (bought in ritchie
st. for Rs. 250) which worked fine for me to sync Evolution with my
Nokia 6021. Wifi worked well with WEP & WPA. Widescreen resolution
works after installing 915resolution package. I also have beryl
running fine in this laptop. I'll add complete details on
www.linux-on-laptops.com some time.

Well., obviously because GNU Emacs tries to find a 'startup file' which
might be either just elisp., or compiled elisp., or gzipped elisp.,
etc., which can be in different locations and not just in the root of
your home folder. Different people want to arrange their configuration
files in different ways.

DTrace is surely a good tool for profiling and instrumentation., but
that does not mean an application should cut down its features just
because it is resource expensive to have them.

Message-ID: <ef7327bc0611272221j17ddc307u2239868aea6b8a64@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have written several python scripts that need to
run on small hardware.  My "batteries included" python
2.4 installation occupies too much space:

[basha@castlerock /usr/lib]$ du -sh python2.4
 36M    python2.4

There are several standard python modules that I don't
require at all.  Eg. lib-tk, curses, logging, test (which
I use during development but not for release).  The "test"
folder alone occupies 11MB.

Removing the extra stuff by hand is laborious and error
prone.  I'm looking for a convenient way to identify
dependencies and remove the extra modules/folders.

Further more, in my final python distribution I don't want
any .py/.pyo files, I only want the .pyc files.

I don't want to build standalone executables that
py2app/py2exe produces, but instead I just want to trim
my lib/python2.4.

Can someone please suggest some python magic that I can
use to reduce my lib/python2.4 bloat?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions and help!

Some of his slides if some of you missed the talk:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/vamseek/sets/72157594395245989/


I have a couple of videos I want to upload (the "Blinkenlights" video
came out surprisingly well), but my vids are a little bigger than what
YouTube expects - well over 100MB. I wanna reduce the resolution of the
.avi files and make them much smaller. Any tools you guys would recommend?

IMO, the installation size wont really slow down your scripts since you
are not importing all the modules into your scripts.

One way, to minimalize 'bloat' is to install "python-minimal" package,
if you are using debian or one of "*.deb" distros. Your distribution
should have a similar package. Another way is to compile python from
source..Features you dont want can be disabled during the './configure'
stage with appropriate flags.

With gentoo you could set USE flags while emerging the system

Although you can do away with .pyo, I have never seen any python app
that has excluded .py..

They assigned you a port number? Or is that an ip:port of a proxy server?

Boot into Windows, go to network settings (I dont know exactly what it
is called) and see whether something called DHCP is turned on. Else.,
note down the ip-address, mask, gateway, DNS numbers there and use them
on GNU/Linux.

I use the tutorial at http://www.irfca.org/misc/video.html to reduce
the size of my digicam-videos to acceptable levels. The instructions
are for Windows though, but work extremely well.

I _think_ Google Video supports arbitrary sized files.
You can use ffmpeg to reduce the resolution of your video. Something like:
./ffmpeg -vcodec mpeg4 -b 1000 -r 10 -g 300 -i ~/test.avi -s 800?600
~/test-800-600.avi

I personally like the ffmpeg2theora package (much simpler to use than
ffmpeg directly)

It has nothing to do with the shell you are running.
Read grep(1), there's an option -A that can do this for you.

Good idea but I would just do this to reduce file size. Brightness I don't know. I think it should be straight forward.

ffmpeg -i video.avi video.flv 

:)

Perhaps you can try both approaches and figure out what works best.

Hi All,
Thanks for all the suggestions regarding using linux on a P III with
64 MB RAM. Since open office was a compulsory requirement I upgraded
the RAM to 192MB and installed SUSE 10.1. I played with different
window managers and settled with blackbox. Then disabled daemons like
ftp, ssh etc. The system works like a charm. Open office works
comfortably, so does firefox.

couldnt he run, create the .pyc files and then create dummy 0  
byte .py files and make them older than the .pyc files - should run  
and the empty .py files would take up minimum space

great to know that but disappointed after talking to dell, bangalore.
They say that linux is not supported nor they recommend it even if i go for it. most importantly the hardware issues will not be dealt with if the OS is linux. felt it is quite ridiculous and waste of money as i have to pay money for windows which i dont use and no hardware support withing warranty period as i wish to be loading linux on it!

i would like to know companies which cover warranty (especially hardware) period with linux as OS.

Dell actually refund Windows cost for a Linux user in UK why not try that here
http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110706-dell-windows.html
and also AFAIK they can't say hardware warranty is unsupported if we use Linux.

But I am sure I cannot beat him at least as far as TCP goes.

I strongly urge you to take a look at his slides. It will help clarify at least some details about the ocean of TCP...

I regret not having used enough pictures in my slides.

I will try my level best to include as many as I can.

Use kppp / gnome ppp dialer etc. That should set things up more or less

If you need help look at

(1) Producing a .pyc distribution
----------------------------------
You can produce a '.pyc' only distribution using the compiler module

http://docs.python.org/lib/compiler.html

(2) Finding dependencies
------------------------

Check modulefinder http://docs.python.org/lib/module-modulefinder.html

IIRC, py2exe uses this module. Looking at the py2exe code might be useful.

(3) Compressing Modules
-----------------------
Finally you can put your modules in a zip file and import them. That
helps to save space.

http://docs.python.org/lib/module-zipfile.html

Finally what is the 2.4 bloat you are talking about ?   Try lifting a
car battery  it's pretty heavy ;-)

hi,

Asking  which one is better of ? ASP.NET or PHP5

My Vote is for PHP

It is free, No one is blind to buy Visual studio.net package.

PHP runs on apache as well as on IIS though Apache wins the war, one another
reason why free softwares are powerful.

If you want your application to be light weight .

Learning curve is simple

Learning PHP will give you idea about the strong fundamental concepts, large
Samples of asp.net programmers couldnt say what you mean by running at
"server" and "client", IMHO, may be sampling error too.

Php has to be learnt by linear programming style (as a scripting language),
MVC coding style such as symfony or php cake.

Unlike ASP.NET , PHP is not idiot friendly , you do have to put some time to
avoid dragging and dropping elements.

Learning PHP with MVC coding style gives Smooth transition in adapting any
high powered framework as Rails, Django or Turbo gears

Any way , deciding software is a horses of courses, my suggestion to you is,
Have good time with (P)redominant (H)ealthy (P)ractice instead of dozing
with (AS)lee(P).net

I think I did not make myself clear in my original post.
I'm trying to reduce the disk usage only (my flash disk
size is very limited).

Thanks for suggesting the python-minimal package.  As the name
suggests it's minimal, and does not even include the xml parsing
routines!  None of my scripts worked using the minimal package.

Further, my problem is that I don't know what modules my scripts
require.  I would not know which ones to leave out.

Anyway, I solved the problem by using "modulefinder". It did not
do a 100% job, and I had to add about a dozen or so files
manually.

Thanks for all the help and guidance provided!

I'm also limited by the number of inodes on my flash disk, so even
empty files count :(

I generated all .pyc files (using compileall) and deleted all .py
files.  The problem I faced was that nothing from "site-packages"
could be loaded.  I then copied back site.py and still no luck.

Creating empty .py files as you suggested also did not help.

I think for the moment, I'll live with .py and .pyc files in my
disk.  I'm happy that I've reduced my lib/python2.4 from 36MB to
under 4MB.  Beyond this, I'm reaching the point of diminishing
returns :-)

Thanks for everyone's help!

Thanks for the tip!  This offers a further reduction of disk
by atleast 50% and a drastic reduction in inode usage.

Using zipfile on all of lib/python2.4 is tricky.  I'll have
to leave enough stuff outside the zip file (zlib, zipfile.py,
dependencies), so the other modules can be mounted/accessed
by python.

I'm also worried if zip file access will increase memory
usage or create uncompressed files in /tmp.

I'll just settle with what I've accomplished so far and let
zipping wait for another day.

Thanks again for all your suggestions.

Message-ID: <406f1f3f0611282319s49e119a7qa7d6c9deac66e3b6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I had set up SUSE 10.1 on a P-III box. All works fine except the
internal modem. The internal modem does not work in linux. I was
hoping that SUSE would detect all hardware. A little research showed
that mine was a winmodem which does not have a linux driver. Since
internal modems cost only less than 500Rs I am planning to get a
decent linux modem. Does anybody know if there is an easily available
(and easily installable) linux modem in Indian market
Thanks

any serial modem works - avoid usb modems (they look like a rat). If  
it costs around 1500, it will work perfectly.

Google ofcourse uses Linux based OS. Yahoo though uses FreeBSD.
Rediff uses RHEL AS
Amazon too seems to use Linux http://news.com.com/2100-1001-275155.html

passwordless ssh key. or passwordless sudo

But your admin will have to give your username NOPASSWD privileges for
whatever script it is you want to run.

svnowner ALL = NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/svn update /var/www

linux+apache is a killer combo and many many sites run that.

You can easily get stats by querying the Apache cgi interface...

google's server farm used to be completely based on RedHat but I am not sure if they changed it. Last time I heard they had more than 8000 machines.

Amazon,eBay and Yahoo! run FreeBSD if I am not mistaken. Not sure.

Yahoo! does run Solaris also I think. But they are a big FreeBSD shop.

Server grade hardware used to run Solaris in the olden days but now I think linux and BSDs have taken over.

The recent stats effort by Marc Fournier of FreeBSD showed OpenBSD as the highest used system in the US but many people doubt its validity.

People just  want to claim they run OpenBSD bcoz they think it is cool to do so!

Yes, statistics don't mean much.

But this much is sure. Linux is big business. No two ways about it.

Check the sudo man page, there is a way to specify "no passwd"
option only to few commands.

Read this. Very smooth reading, very well written, talks to
all levels of readers from the novice to the expert.

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_8-4/index.html

Not the second article. I am talking about the first one "Challenge in anti spam efforts".

If you read these things my talk will make much more sense.

Tried the smartlink modem drivers?

I have used it for 2.4 Linux kernels:

Recent packages should support 2.6 Linux kernels.

The bad thing about this is that people tend to become immune to being
aware of whether they are running a command with root privileges or
not and end up with a mess. But then, some people are immune even when
they type the password out.

Sorry for a not so useful comment here :)

Also Linux (RH-based) for the search backends.

The point is, if you decide to be careless, nobody can stop u :p And I
dont think putting a password helps much from a social engineering
perspective... This less painful technique is atleast useful in
coaxing linux newbies to use sudo rather than logging into X as root
(believe me, those straight out of windows have a huge tendency to do
this, and then screw up their system, and crib that Linux is as bad as
Windows when it comes to security :) ). I guess you will have a hard
time convincing them if you ask them to enter a password each time :)

it moves on...

The above ebook will do the job..

You might want to take a look at gtk as well..
ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/tutorial/

Just a suggestion if you dont know already, Whatever you do do not use
the code generation feature of glade2..Its a big no no..I had nightmares
with that. Code the callbacks manually..Instead use libglade to load the
 glade xml during runtime. This way you dont need to compile the project
each and everytime you make changes to the UI. FYI, Glade3 has this code
generation "feature" completely removed. Additionally you might want to
install documentation regarding libglade, gtk2.0 through your package
manage system so that you may access them through devhelp.

The second article is a very useful addition to the first one

And good choice .. Cisco's IP Journal always comes up with really good
articles, and this one by Dave Crocker (author of RFC 822 so yes, he
does know something about email I'd say) is a very good one indeed.

Hai ,
          I have a problem in PTHREAD -> priority.
          I used various scheduling algorithm for it like
SCHED_OTHER,SCHED_FIFO,SCHED_RR.

          Some are saying that we cant able to change the kernel[scheduler].
I tried it with superuser permission also. Its not working...
          This is the sample program that i cant able to set priority :
Eg:

#include<pthread.h>
#include<stdio.h>

void *
multiply (int *a)
{
  int i;
  int cancel_mul_state;
  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    {
      printf ("this is thread_multiply : %d\n",*a=(*a * *a));
      sleep (1);
    }
  printf ("I am thread_multiply\n");
  printf ("This is Multiply thread_id : %d\n", pthread_self ());
}

void *
add (int *a)
{
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    {
      printf ("this is thread_add : %d\n",*a=(*a + *a));
      sleep (1);
    }
  printf ("I am thread_add\n");
  printf ("This is Add thread_id : %d\n", pthread_self ());
}


int
main ()
{
  pthread_t thread_id_multiply, thread_id_add,thread_id_divide;

  pthread_attr_t t_attr1,t_attr2;
  struct sched_param para1,para2;
  int a = 1;

  pthread_attr_init(&t_attr1);
  pthread_attr_init(&t_attr2);

  pthread_attr_setinheritsched(&t_attr1,PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED);
  pthread_attr_setinheritsched(&t_attr2,PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED);

  pthread_attr_setscope(&t_attr1,PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM);
  pthread_attr_setscope(&t_attr2,PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM);

  pthread_attr_setschedpolicy(&t_attr1,SCHED_RR);
  pthread_attr_setschedpolicy(&t_attr1,SCHED_RR);

  para1.sched_priority=22;
  pthread_attr_setschedparam(&t_attr1,&para1);

  para2.sched_priority=11;
  pthread_attr_setschedparam(&t_attr2,&para2);

  printf ("This is Main thread : %d\n", pthread_self ());


  pthread_create (&thread_id_add, &t_attr1,(void *) &add, &a);
  pthread_create (&thread_id_multiply, &t_attr2,(void *) &multiply, &a);

  pthread_join (thread_id_add, NULL);
  pthread_join (thread_id_multiply, NULL);

  return 0;
}

There is something wrong in your fundamental goal and assumptions.

Rethink your design. That is all I can say.

You should never have to invoke a perl script supposed to be run by root as normal user...

It is easy to solve your problem if you think a little differently.

All the best!

Even highly placed most accomplished persons I have met have no idea about security. :)

LOL!

They only have paranoia at best and are largely clueless about the details.

LOL, agreed when you compare them with other open source softwares. My
mentor used to say the same thing. :) but occasionaly something strikes like
guyz at zend and some fabulous app developers like (some example) sugarcrm
vtiger  all runs on php.
    technically i will correct it to (p)erhaps (h)ygene (p)ractice,
accepting the loopholes, and exploring or at least looking for betterment in
the following versions.
The question to the thread is asking for the better software product?
ASP.net or  PHP, i vouched for php .


when my friend shared the programming apects of  python, i was zapped, then
understood php stuff as a pretty trivial stuff. but if i would have been
introduced to python up front, i have a doubt that whether i would have
learnt the basics?. so learning php and keep moving atleast helped me in
understanding the stuff effectively. IMHO

This is my first post. I have using windows for a long time :P and linux intermittently. Now that my BE is going to get over (phewww!!! at last :D), I am seriously considering LERARNING linux. As you might have guessed I another BE student placed in an IT company from just-another engg coll affliated to anna univ. I also have plans for going to US for my masters( in information management,ofcourse).

Now coming to my question - My PC is a celeron 330MHz, 320MB SDRAM, 8GB HDD. I am plannin to install Debian GNU/Linux 4.0(Etch). Actually waiting for the release of the stable version. I know linux(especially Debian) is resource heavy, would you advice me install it. I am currently running Windows XP(with SP2). I have tried a version of Mandrake and FC1 and both performed well.

Looking forward to learning more.

kind regards
AK
(you can also call me KING or kuchcha).

Who said so? I run Debian GNU/Linux on 500 Mhz, 128 MB
RAM. Runs extremely well.

Yes.

Enjoy the learning experience.

Well Sudarshan..thanks for the book.

And I do understand your concern about the code-generation tool. I was always a little uncomfortable with it. Anyway It's great to hear that it's been removed for glade 3.0

The above ebook will do the job..

You might want to take a look at gtk as well..
ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/tutorial/

Just a suggestion if you dont know already, Whatever you do do not use
the code generation feature of glade2..Its a big no no..I had nightmares
with that. Code the callbacks manually..Instead use libglade to load the
glade xml during runtime. This way you dont need to compile the project
each and everytime you make changes to the UI. FYI, Glade3 has this code
generation "feature" completely removed. Additionally you might want to
install documentation regarding libglade, gtk2.0 through your package
manage system so that you may access them through devhelp.

they do know if there's something seriously wrong with their system...

as the guy who gave sudharshan this advice i would like to add:  
Glade, or any other GUI screen builder is *not* a substitute for  
knowledge on how to build screens. If you know how to do it manually,  
then glade *may* help you do it faster. If you dont know how to do it  
manually - you are going to wind up in the soup using glade. A rule  
of thumb is to use the GUI for a quick and dirty general layout and  
then fine-tune manually. (this also holds true for wxGlade or Boa  
Constructor - or, for that matter, in a different context, Pgadmin or  
phppgadmin wrt sql)

actualy this is misleading - even google will not help if you ask a  
dumb question. The key to google, or the key to getting an answer/ 
solution, is to ask smart questions. Often, in the very process of  
formulating the question, the answer becomes obvious. Again and again  
I have seen this - one person searches google for hours and doesnt  
find an answer. The next person gets the answer on the first try  
itself. And the key to asking smart questions is hard work and hard  
thinking. The so-called 'dumb' questions resolve into two kinds. One  
is 'n00b' question, where the person is totally new to the field and  
has no idea where to *start* looking for the answer. This is not a  
dumb question - the person should not be flamed and should be pointed  
to the pathway to the solution. The second type of dumb question is  
the 'lazy' question - the person asking is too lazy to think for  
himself and expects to be spoonfed. Incidently the askers of both  
these types of dumb questions are unlikely to get answers from google  
as the first has no clue as to what keywords to put and the second is  
too lazy to think about this.

i could agree there - but what i disagree about is when you say the  
learning curve for php is easy. That is not so. It is more difficult  
to write good programs in PHP than in any other scripting language.  
(note: i say 'good programs')

Shakthi,

Do you run KDE/GNOME or a lighter WM like IceWM?

Also, do you think Etch will run as well as Sarge does on such a
system? I am wary because Etch has all updated software which make it
a little more desktop hungry for desktop usage.

Anyway, I can assure you that I have used Sarge on a worse system (64
MB RAM) with IceWM and it works pretty well.

Thanks.

Kumar

M$ uses 'akamai' for caching services. Probably 'akamai' uses gnu/linux
for their services.

There is a python vs. php comparison at:
http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonVsPhp

http://phpsec.org/ has a number of pages on handling security with php.  
If there is a security issue with php that you have newly discovered, 
write about it at:  http://bugs.php.net/report.php

It is not as if only php has security issues and makes such requests. 
Postgresql also requests users to report about any vulnerability at 
http://www.postgresql.org/support/security.html Most free software 
projects do take security threats seriously, and deal with them quickly. 

Some statistics on how popular php and others are at:
http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.200610/apachemods.html

Btw, there is an interesting performance benchmarking (php vs perl vs 
python) at:
http://dealnews.com/developers/memcached.html

But what has debian to do with this? Its newer KDE and gnome that is
getting heavier and debian only packages what it gets, isn't it?

I run sarge (sid) with gnome on 256M athlon machine and is pretty
fine. Ya, of course using IceWM is a good alternative for lower RAM.

Kenneth,

	You should read Paul Graham. In the high tech biz your advertising is thro' word of mouth and other channels on the Internet.

	If a techie is down to earth, willing to face truth and criticism he needs no MBA guy at all....

	Give me two years time. I will prove it. :)

	Also elderly people are another crowd to be avoided like the plague.

	They are far less expeditious, they are die hard naysayers and deliberate too much though they are generally more mature.

	But I have seen so many naysayers in ILUGC who are in their early twenties. It is a matter of shame. 

	Youth should be a period of confidence, energy and courage.

	Instead I find many youngsters in India thinking,"Oh, that has already been done. How do I start? The West is better than me."

	This is defeatist thinking I tell you. 

	If everyone thought like that we would not be having 5 text mode browsers, so many graphical mail  clients and so on.

	Variety is the spice of life and the world is large enough to accommodate everyone.

	Another time someone in ILUGC discourages someone I am going to blow my top.

regards,
Girish

I feel that I have not been clear enough.

It is extremely easy for techies to dupe the management.

Always genuine talent resorts to straight forward methods and phoney people resort to tricks to impress the management.

It is very very easy for the management to get taken in and the real techie suffers. Yes, I am talking from experience.

I can imagine these things happening in nearly every company in India.

I hear that Intel which pays like mad has plenty of dirty politics going on in the name of competing teams doing the same thing better.

Indians I think are the worst managers on earth. And couple this with the fact that the managers are not able to make out between wheat and chaff...

Hence my reasoning.

We have been enslaved for 3000 years.

What is the characteristic of slaves? Jealousy.

We cannot tolerate the prosperity of our friends and people around us.

It need not be prosperity, it can even be technical brilliance.

I find extremely well placed highly respected people suffering from this psychosis.

At the same time I observe that Chennai culture is far better in this respect than Bangalore. Here people are somewhat idiosyncratic but at least much more sensible than Bangalore.

I don't have a solution to the problem but at least I am open about the problem. I think once we identify the problem and accept it in true earnest the solution can be found in due course.

Sorry for sounding harsh. Sometimes we just have to bite the bullet...

Sorry for spoiling your mood and offending you.

Girish

urgh, you mean jealousy was brought into indian minds just because of 
some D/E/F/P enslaving us ?

* Indians were fighting with one another far before Westerners started 
their occupation in India.

* There were very small small kingdoms fighting with one another, while 
big big kingdoms were fighting on the other side.

What was the reason ? Jealousy ?!

* If these Indians have not been jealous, then there wouldn't have been 
any occupation/enslavement for the 3000 years as you mentioned.

More than this, the same is true for every nation, even the enslavers 
themselves.

Jealousy is humans' instinct property; but its jealousy in some form 
drives competitiveness, provided its within self-controllable limits.

At the risk of taking it more off-topic, though I'm not an MBA myself, I
find that remark offensive and misinformed. You're generalizing too
much, and those "fool MBAs" are very important for running big
companies. As some one who got to work with many MBAs and see their work
first-hand, I am far less cynical about their abilities. Their
contributions are real, and you're deluding yourself if you think
they're not useful.

Lots of people use Akamai for many things including DNS load
balancing, Static resources Caching, Static partial caching (ie.,. if
a particular aspect of the web content your service returns is static,
like say, a menu bar or a long piece of text, that can be cached).
Another interesting thing people could do is to use Akamai to deliver
geography specific content/ads. Not sure how many people do this now.

Yes.

Akamai is on Linux and Microsoft heavily depends on their services

http://toolbar.netcraft.com/site_report?url=http://www.akamai.com
showing Akamai is using Linux as their OS

And click this link for Akamai and M$ deal

Agree. And no, am not an MBA either!

Someone, somewhere on the web had this advice for programmers (am
paraphrasing): Don't assume the MBAs are stupid and don't understand
logic. Many times they are math or physics majors before they became
MBAs and are probably better than you at logic!

Does anyone know if any of these companies or any other,use virtual
machines (Xen, UML, etc) to host their heavy-traffic sites ? I know
Amazon is using Xen for their EC2 service and lots of hosting
providers abroad give you an UML instance - but these sites may not be
getting  a lot of traffic. Just curious to hear examples of  VM's
holding up under heavy traffic in the real world.

i have had quite a lot of experience using vps instances. Problem is  
memory, service providers in price wars - some guy with a vps on the  
same machine as yours suddenly hogs all the memory and you are in the  
soup. Ok for low traffic sites - otherwise avoid them, get your own  
box. And a lot of vps providers are going bankrupt.

Incidentally, Rasmus appeared to be slightly upset with all the
criticism that PHP is getting these days, during his presentation at
FOSS.in 2006. He pointed out that lots of folks who write blog posts
critical of PHP weren't probably aware that Wordpress itself is
written in PHP. I don't think this is a good response. But it just
shows how much criticism  - lots of valid ones, and most of it
uninformed is floating around.

As he himself put it, 'PHP is for the weekend warrior' - that's a good
thumb rule for deciding whether you want to invest time in PHP.

Seriously. I don't think he has ever pretended that it's perfect.
Explaining his attitude he said that he finds programming to be boring
and tedious, and that his main interest was in solving problems. It's
the religious crowd that you find around any piece of OSS that has
made it sound like it's the solution to everything. I remember in an
earlier FOSS talk (iirc, 2000) he admitted that when he wrote PHP
first, he wasn't even aware of how to write parsers.

The MBA is what makes them qualified to "manage" the team. You didn't
specify what field their graduation was in - presumably it is
something which made them qualified to manage "engineering" teams and
file for patents etc.

One is an Engineer and another a Physics grad. I believe one must have a 
technical bent of mind/ I know of a school graduate who has 11 patents 
and was a distinguished engineer in CISCO and a BA (Literature)who makes 
technology investment decisions.

This might be of some interest for people who arent fortunate enough to

The script does a similar job like the one above..
http://omicron.homeip.net/projects/#easy_e17.sh

It downloads all the packages from the E17 CVS. The script wont work
unless you have automake1.9 (no..not 1.10) and autoconf 2.60..Skip the
package called etk_server since it freezes when compiling..

Oh and theres a distribution called elive which is essentially etch with
E17 as the default desktop instead of GNOME, it  uses etch repositories
for the packages..Its a worth a try too

Thanks. I realize that comment was somewhat offensive though I meant it.

One of the main problems faced by my country today is that of technical people going the MBA track. I want to put my foot down and say 

"This is not done."

Business is to be learnt by experience and entrepreneurship is to be learnt by failures. MBA schools may be teaching useful things but I am very cynical about the utility. They are creating more snobs with fat pay packages and hugely exaggerated capabilities.

It is not true that an MBA degree can substitute for real world biz experience.

As of now there is very little credence and importance given to technical capability in India which I think is a side effect of the place where India is operating on the technology value chain.

And the attention that MBA institutions are receiving is also misplaced. I am not saying that they are unnecessary or evil but that in real technology companies they don't have a place.

And again let us come back to anecdotes.

Bill Gates, Narayana Murthy, Premji, Dell, Shiv Nadar all of them were eithe engineers or not even that. Why?

Entrepreneurship is built by technical talent and confidence and real world experience. No Harvard MBA or classroom theory can give you that.

MBA people may make money but they always work for companies...

The fact that there are no real hi tech companies in India have led people to believe that MBA degrees can give them access to better lifestyles.

Perhaps true but I don't want potential technical people killed by this mentality.

Girish

I agree that the host OS can get cranky when you have  a whole bunch
of VMs running, but with Xen's ability to migrate VMs between hosts,
an intelligently designed hosting setup might just be able to handle
the load. I am surprised to hear that with most ISPs,  VMs are allowed
to hog resources affecting the performance of other VMs. I am not sure
how you ensure resource hogging does not happen with Xen, but
Microsoft's Virtual server allows you to prioritize VMs on the fly -
pretty neat and their API is just awesome. Performance is slightly
worser than other proprietary and open source VM managers.  Wait, I
just praised Microsoft on this list .... /me scrams

We can argue on this for millions of years, without coming to any
conclusion. I personally believe this it all boils down on what you
really want to do. Both are tools. Use it at the appropriate place.

I love PHP, I draw pleasure programming in it.  I enjoy working in
wordpress and looking at other cool discussion boards, which
completely run in PHP. The simplicity and the ease at which one could
write programs is amazing. The sense of satisfaction is incomparable.
If I am going to develop a portal, with some 10 really enthusiastic
people, with very good knowledge on OO concepts, I will choose PHP.

On the other hand, When I am this big corporate and looking for a RAD
framework, where some 50 people with decent programming skills can
work on this mammoth web application where deadline is the key, Well,
I will go for ASP.Net.  Coupled with Visual Studio.Net, it sure is an
awesome framework to work on. The level of debugging and the event
driven layer to web development, inbuilt webcontrols, all make things
simpler for programmers and let them write less code and hence lesser
bugs.

"Hang on, Visual Studio is not free."
I don't care. Getting a license is more easier and simple than
hiring(and sometimes managing) very good programmers.

"But the employees loose their sense of satisfaction when working with
ASP.Net, as things are so easy and ready made."
who cares.? Client is happy @ EOD.

There is no one answer to your question. There are a whole lot of
parameters which define the most appropriate platform for building an
application. I dont think it is very wise to generalize stuff and get
into this debate of which is the best?

That`s right. A long conversation has been going on one topic. But, it
really giving me various types of knowledge on both PHP and ASP.NET. This
has been very knowledgable, really and also nice to learn.

Thanks anyway.
