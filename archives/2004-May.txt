Subject: [Ilugc] Open or Closed? (Exploiting Software)
Message-ID: <LAEEKJKAGLFCOHMNNIINMENBDGAA.rajendran@xerago.com>

Hi All,

Saw this (rather heard this) interview of Greg Hoglund and Gary McGraw,
authors of "Exploiting Software: How to break code".

MP3 available here:- http://net-security.org/article.php?id=677
Terrifically interesting.

Most intriguing sound-bit being,
"Q:- In your opinion, is closed source software, or open source software
more secure?"

For a most interesting answer, rush to time 2:51 of this MP3.
(6:41 is total duration. File size is:- 4.7 MB)
I could have transcribed the answer down myself here, but two things
prevented me.
a) You need to hear the intonations, silent chuckles, smirks, etc. to really
enjoy it.
b) The answer, surprisingly, WAS NOT SHORT, nor what I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
!!

Rajendran.

We have two problems with regard to sendmail.

miniserv.pl is taking up 75% of CPU in our debian

$ cat /proc/6258/cmdline

/usr/share/webmin/sendmail/save_feature.cgi

What is this save_feature.cgi that is eating up the
CPU?

Should I kill that process.


Second
~~~~~~

A weird stuff is happening.  /var/spool/mqueue/
directory is growing in size at the rate of ~2MB per
minute.  This is eating up the /var/ partion space.  

FYI, we have just upgraded the server to `sid`

No idea what these miniserv.pl and save_feature.cgi are - but either 
they are perl scripts installed on your webserver, and being exploited 
by spammers to send out junk mail, or some spammer hacked your 
mailserver, installed these and is using it to send out junk mail.

Unlike DOS, linux does not search the current directory to find the
program you are trying to run, unless the current directory is specified
in the PATH environment variable. 

If you want to run a program placed in the current directory (like
'add'), you will have to run by typing './add'

The other option will be to add the current directory (.) in the PATH
variable. This makes the system less secure, hence generaly not used.

Hello,
         My server Mdk10 CE with eth0 to gateway
and eth1 for LAN. Squid is running on the server.
I want to allow direct internet access on the server.
All internet access on the LAN ( eth1 ) I want  redirected
to port 3128 ( squid ).
I have done changes in squid.conf.

Thanks

Just block port 80 outbound.

Ask people on your LAN to use your.squid.proxy:3128 in their browser

Use IPTables / IPChains to redirect all outgoing PORT 80
requests through squid.

something like
-A PREROUTING -i eth1 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3128
should do.

Hi everybody,

I posted problem abt incompatibility of Mandrake10CE's X with Intel 865. I increased the frame buffer size in BIOS from 1MB to 8MB and it worked! Now my monitor is shaking more after doing this,even in WindowsXP. Will increasing frame buffer size affect my monitor?

More over, the resolution automatically set by Mandrake is 1024X768 but it doesn't look like what it is in XP. It seemes there is problem with refresh rate.

Pls help

Thanks a lot
Mahesh

Check where XMMS is installed and check whether it is in the PATH. Try 
'which xmms' in console. If it exists in the path, try running xmms from 
xterm or gnome-terminal and see what it says. (May be seg fault or 
missing libraries...)

  This type of error occurs when a process tries to
access a memory that corresponds to another process
i.e which is not allocated to it.  This is often
caused due to improper usage of pointers in the
program. The corresponding signal to this error is
SIGSEGV. U use a debugger such as gdb to rectify the
prob or else u can use strace. 
   In ur case u try to install ymessenger once again.
If it behaves the same way then u try with a different
src.

Red Hat Inc. on Tuesday will announce its new desktop offering, the Red Hat
Desktop, which the company said will be available by the middle of this
month.
 
The new desktop product is targeted at those Microsoft Corp. customers
currently running Windows 98, NT and 2000 and who are looking at the end of
support for their platforms from the Redmond, Wash., software maker.
 
Red Hat is also targeting those customers concerned about "lock-in" with the
technology behind Longhorn [the next version of Windows] and where the
operating system is headed and exactly what Microsoft will build into it.
"Those are things that are starting to swirl around our prospective
customers' minds," said Mike Ferris, an enterprise Linux product manager for
Raleigh N.C.-based Red Hat in an interview with eWEEK.

hi there...
well regd ur problem u had posted ....with squid u can pan certain sites by composing rules using acl rules
 
ex
acl 4jobs dstdomain www.4jobs.com
acl expertsexchange dstdomain www.experts-exchange.4jobs.com
acl our_networks src 192.168.0.1/31 #192.168.2.0/24
http_access deny jobstreet
http_access deny 3pjobs
http_access deny careerindia

 
u can also log all those internet request which are taking place through the server and then u can gnerate reporst and cehck what kind of access is taking place.....
 
this can be invoked by specifying the NETMASK....so u wud know who is access what and how many bytes and so on...which brings us to reporting.....
 
there are many reporting tools...my fav is calamaris

I think U want to use trasparent proxy thru squid. I am also using the same. For this make your squid as a transparent proxy and redirect the request for port # 80 to 3128
like the following rule.
 
#iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128 

This will do.

GAIM is an instant messenger and it supports the Yahoo

Subject: [Ilugc] VMWare workstation version 4 for windows
Message-ID: <4098A7FE.70309@aspiresys.com>

Hi all,

  I successfully installed Knoppix on VMWare.  I just have 2 issues.

   *  I set this in my office computer.  And I have been assigned a 
local ip(192.168.0.44).  Just
wondering how can I browse Internet through VMWare Knoppix.

   *  I tried dragging files from windows(XP) to knoppix but it is not 
allowing me to drag and drop.  I even
tried to create a shared folder  i.e Edit virtual machine settings -> 
Options tab -> Shared Folders ->
Add.  Here I added a new folder i.e myshare.  But I am not able to see 
this folder under linux.  Normally
it should be inside /mnt.

   Any help here would be greatly appreciated.

  Have a great day.

goto the configuration editor and select natting or select bridging if you
are able to get a public IP. you should then be able to browse

drag and drop is only between windows-> windows
this is documented

ensure that vmware-guestd is running in the guest
if not then recompile vmware-config.pl

(I assume here that you have compiled vmware-config.pl at least once)

Hi,

I am planning to buy an AMD system instead of the
usual intel.

Is it fully compatible with linux and windows.(ie) can
i use exisiting distrubution cd to install on amd
system or do i have to get a amd specific
distribution.

is AMD x86 architecture too? can i use it for x86
embedded linux development tools?

shriram

That's a good choice.

If you are going for AMD Athlon series, then it is fine. You can use 
your existing Windows or Linux binaries on it. AMD Opteron series need 
distributions for IA64 to get the most out of the processor. But 
remember AMD Opteron series can operate in 32 bit mode too.

As I said AMD Kx, Duron, Athlon series processors are IA32 or x86. You 
can very well use it.

HTH.

Hi,

yes its very much possible.

you have to install the boot loader for the second 
linux distro you are goin to install in the partition
itself (not on MBR) and you have to have a single boot
partition to store boot files.

then include the details of this boot file info as a
seperate entry in LILO or GRUB of the first distro 
you have installed.

Hope u got the message.

shriram.

I have few questions about AMD,

- One of my friend told, AMD will produce huge amount heat, due to poor
cooling system most time the performance will go down, Thatz why AMD not
familiar in Chennai, is it true ???

- In AMD there is no cache memory, will it affect the performance ??? 

- Is it suitable for corporate usage,  using Windows or Linux ???

AMD has no cache memory: thats not right. if u want more info, check
www.amd.com

as for performance, its pretty good. sometimes even better than intel stuff

abt heat, it does generate heat. if u r gettin from an assembler, get from
one who knows what hes doin.
mine missed out fan in the back and fried my motherboard.

was  under warranty. had him replace it. amd gives info on cooling.
u will need a fan in the front of case. one on cpu  (normally comes with
it) , one in rear of power supply (comes by default)
and one in back ( will remove heat of processor away from motherboard)

make sure u get the right motherboard. find out which motherboard is
compatible with Athlon.

used 2 athlon machines without problems.

if u have further questions, feel free to ask.

regards,
Sanjay

So fix your open relay please.

You misconfigured your sendmail and now spammers are using it to send

Hello all,

Back when I was using Windows, I used to cache
webpages and then read them later offline. This did
lead to a very Bloated Internet Explorer but was very
easy going on my phone bill.

Now with Mozilla 1.7a I'm unable to work offline as
freely as I used to with IE. I tried using a large
cache size and a bigger history period but still
webpages refuse to be displayed offline.

I know its a good thing that offline browsing is very
limited. This does improve security, as earlier even
Rediffmail and Hotmail could be read offline.This is
prevented in Mozilla.

Is anyone using an alternative browser for their
"offline-reading" ? it would be of much help.

I have Epiphany,Firefox and Konqueror as my
alternative browsers but hardly use them.

Regards,
Toufeeq

hi,
thnx for the info.

However I couldnt get any download page for wwoffle.
:(
Tried google/frshmeat and sourceforge.
 
Another question.. Is "Link Prefetching" in Mozilla
any good for dial-up users. Though it sounds good I
doubt its efficiency.

Thanks Toufeeq

There are lot of myths about AMD. Basically, old AMD processors produced 
a lot of heat. But Athlon series don't have this problem. I use AMD from 
K6 II 500 MHz to Athlon XP 2000+ My current processor donot exceed 42C 
in temperature. That's too good.

Come on. Who said that AMD doesn't have cache memory. It has.

> - Is it suitable for corporate usage,  using Windows or Linux ???

AMD is now widely used in corporates. For gaming, AMD with nVidia nForce 
2 board is a good choice either for Linux or for Windows.

If we use a single boot partition won`t the files which r similar, though not same between distros get overwritten thereby causing some errors with functionality.

It is very much possible. You already got some acknowldgements for that. 
Let me tell you with an example how to do it.

In this example I assume that you have only one partition for each of 
the Linux distro (/ alone and not seperate /boot, /home, /usr, etc).

Let this be the scenario.

/dev/hda1 - Linux Swap (At the beginning of the disk to increase the 
speed of swap in/out)
/dev/hda2 - NTFS (Windows)
/dev/hda3 - Linux (For RedHat)
/dev/hda4 - Linux (For SuSE)

Install Windows on /dev/hda2 first.

Install RedHat on /dev/hda3 and install the boot loader (Grub) into the 
MBR (/dev/hda).

Install SuSE on /dev/hda4 and install the boot loader into the BR of 
this partition (/dev/hda4).

Then boot into RedHat, edit the /boot/grub/menu.lst file to add the 
following lines.

title SuSE Linux Boot Loader
rootnoverify (hd0,3)
chainloader +1

This should create an entry for loading the boot loader installed by 
SuSE on /dev/hda4

PS: I don't know why you are talking about same boot partition for both 
distros! Moreover, boot partition is becoming obsolete. I don't use 
seperate partition for boot. I can always use a rescue disk in case of 
some problems.

HTH.

setting the options like creating shorcuts in the desktop,menu items
etc., deselect all the options and press finish. you will get the chat
window. now here after you won't get any segmentation fault from

You mean selective copying?? Does it mean copying files separately and pasting it?? While installing either in text mode or graphics mode all the files get installed as a set and where is the option of separately copying it during the installation of the second Linux distro which is going to take place with the first distro already occupying the /boot partition??
 
What abt the other partitions?? Does it need a separate /, /root, etc...
Or are these distros going to be interoperable??
 
How exactly can you do that, Kindly explain.

I have 2 linuxes in my machine.
I installed RedHat 8 first.
For RedHat,
/boot is mapped to /dev/hda2
/     is mapped to /dev/hda8

Then I compiled this LFS from the source code and put it in /dev/hda9.
After that I compiled the kernel. Put the executable(vmlinuz) in 
/dev/hda2(the /boot of RedHat 8).
Then grub.conf of RedHat 8 so that:
for LFS,
/ is mapped to /dev/hda9
and there is no separate /boot partition.

You can try on the same lines.
Don't specify a separate /boot for Suse(or RedHat or whichever is your 
second distro.)

Regards,
Ram

Message-ID: <OF737B7F54.1A35F013-ON65256E8C.00440657@lntinfotech.com>

Hi,
I am thinking of allocating space for different distros on my 40 GB hard
disk at home.

a) Have a 4.5 GB for  XP ( dont flame)
b) plan on 1.5 GB for backup ( Important files like resume and other docs
in case I remove XP and put somethin else)
c) Debian woody - 10 GB ( Is this too much)
d) Gentoo version 1.4  ( 2 cds)  - 5 GB  (  Is this sufficient)
e) FreeBSD 5.1  ( 4 cds) - 6 GB
f) Open BSD 3.3 (1 cd) - 3GB  ( is this 2 much)
g) RH 9 - 7 GB ( is this 2 much) - plan to do some development for SANE
h) LFS  ( Linux from Scratch) - 4 GB

and  a common swap space of 512 MB  ( have physical RAM of 256 MB)


 Looks like I have already exceeded 40 GB.

Any suggestions?

Regards,
Sanjay

( I will add the distros slowly over time. plan to use GAG boot loader with
booter in root partition of each distro)

This should be OK. Can't have a great deal of Windows softwares in 4.5 
GB though.

This is vital. Plan to increase this.

Over optimistic space. 6 GB can do a good job.

> d) Gentoo version 1.4  ( 2 cds)  - 5 GB  (  Is this sufficient)

Over optimistic again. 3.5 GB is enough.

I think you will not exceep 4 or 5 GB.

> f) Open BSD 3.3 (1 cd) - 3GB  ( is this 2 much)

2 GB should be a good deal for OpenBSD.

> g) RH 9 - 7 GB ( is this 2 much) - plan to do some development for SANE

Depends.

> h) LFS  ( Linux from Scratch) - 4 GB

I think it's less. You should have room for sources and compilation space.

> and  a common swap space of 512 MB  ( have physical RAM of 256 MB)

Enough.

> Any suggestions?

BSDs will not sit on non logical partitions. So, ensure that FreeBSD and 
OpenBSD is on primary partition.

One more issue is that you can't use Linux swap for FreeBSD or OpenBSD. 
You have to create a swap slice inside the BSD partition. So, you have 
to think about additional swap space for BSDs.

Is rsync secure to use. (as scp instead of ftp).

Actually I wanted to upload my project webpage to
sourceforge homepage.  But the SF shell is not quite
responsive.  So planned to copy (only the diff's) from
my machine to the SF system.  So `scp` is not suited
for this.

One correction/suggestion:

OpenBSD will not be able to boot if its partition falls beyond 1024
cylinders.  Also, unless you install every other package, I don't see a

Otherwise I see no problems.

Real software engineers don't like the idea of some inexplicable and
greasy hardware several aisles away that may stop working at any
moment.  They have a great distrust of hardware people, and wish that
systems could be virtual at *___all* levels.  They would like
personal
computers (you know no one's going to trip over something and kill your
DFA in mid-transit), except that they need 8 megabytes to run their
Correctness Verification Aid packages.

I'm making a presentation titled "Why Linux?" in my college. I am
basically looking to explain and tempt this broad range of audience to
try linux. unfortunately it is a twenty minute presentation so i dont
have too much time. and its on the coming tuesday. so i'd appreciate all
the help i can get in getting data together.one the things that
impressed me in the last linux bangalore conference was this display
that i think nat had put up. he had come up with OS market share data
from google (whihc i'm looking for real hard but cant fin, so please
anyone...) and then he had placed that in a pie of world human
population. i need that data. if someone can find it, please mail me
asap.

anymore ideas like that that i can use will be real useful. or if
there's people who have made this kinda presentation reading that would
help too i guess.

I feel you should show lot of screenshot pictures of:

1/ different destop window managers (KDE, Gnome,
Icewm, Fluxbox, Sawfish, xfce, ...)

2/ different application software (xmms, mplayer,
xine, kaffeine, GAIM [running yahoo, msn protocols],
gimp, gkrellm,...) 

3/ different distros (gentoo, red hat, suse, mandrake,
fedora core,...)

to quickly give them a good idea of what Linux is all
about! A picture is equal to a 1000 words :)

You don't need any extra packages for mounting FAT32 and NTFS in Linux. 
The drivers for these files should be either compiled into the kernel or 
compiled as modules. In Fedora, you have the support for FAT32 and NTFS 
in the kernel. So, it should be possible for you to mount these 
partitions directly.

I assume /dev/hda1 is FAT32 and /dev/hda2 is NTFS. The command string to 
mount these two are

# mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/fat -t vfat
# mount /dev/hda2 /mnt/ntfs -t ntfs -o ro

Assuming you have /mnt/fat and /mnt/ntfs. If you are using kernel < 2.6, 
write support is dangerous in NTFS. So, mount it read only. If you are 
running kernel 2.6, then there is a safe write support for NTFS in it.

HTH.

hello,

 i faced the same problem while installing
the yahoo messenger in redhat 9.0.Later i rectified
the
problem by properly uninstalling the package,
while uninstalling the package the temporary folder
(.ymessenger)created for the package remains in our
system inside the home directory by default.so,remove
the dir and try new installation.

Other platforms come with compiler-free distros.
Linux on the other hand comes with tons of free-compiler(s).

I feel you should show lot of screenshot pictures of:

1/ different destop window managers (KDE, Gnome,
Icewm, Fluxbox, Sawfish, xfce, ...)

2/ different application software (xmms, mplayer,
xine, kaffeine, GAIM [running yahoo, msn protocols],
gimp, gkrellm,...)=20

3/ different distros (gentoo, red hat, suse, mandrake,
fedora core,...)

to quickly give them a good idea of what Linux is all
about! A picture is equal to a 1000 words :)

Subject: [Ilugc] Help on Net4india Broadband Connection
Message-ID: <20040509120349.GA2489@shyam.homelinux.org>

Dear ILugC,

	I  recently face a  problem. I  had taken  Net4India Broadband
Connection. But I can't  acesses Internet through My GNU/Linux.

Net4India Working in WinXX:

When the system get booted, my network card get an IP through the DHCP
Server running  on their  private IP  10.32.0.2 and I  will get  an IP
10.32.0.84 . but, to get net access I had to use a dialler provided by
the Net4India services, Where I have to give my username and password.
After logging; I  can access the net. my IP will  be 10.32.0.84 and my
DHCP server, DNS and my Gateway will be 10.32.0.2 .

Net4India Working in GNU/Linux:

When the system  get booted in GNU/Linux. My  Network card assigns the
IP number 10.32.0.84 through the  DHCP protocol making the DNS and the
Default Gateway as 10.32.0.2. But If I try to browse it shows an error
message from the server 10.32.0.2,  the error is Internal Server Error
I think the http  error code is 504, also my exim  or fetchmail is not
working.

1)Is there any method to  'authenticate' the DHCP server,even after I
  get assigned an IP?
2)What can be the problem?  Like are they blocking my connection using
  any cgi scripts?

3)Is any body  using the Net4India Connection through GNU/Linux Box?


Please do help me. Thanks in Advance.

Subject: [Ilugc] Bandwidth monitor app on linux
Message-ID: <20040510221033.A15705@meenakshi.cs.iitm.ernet.in>

Hi all,

A few weeks back there was a discussion about bandwidth usage
on home "broadband" connections. It occured to me that for people
who face such constraints it would be useful to have a breakdown
of their bandwidth utilization app-wise so that they can modify
their 'net usage habits accordingly. 

So here are my thoughts for this potential app:

I looked around to see if it already exists, but while there are
a zillion bandwidth monitor apps for *nix they are aimed at 
sysadmins and don't show app-wise breakdowns. Also, most show
only real time data and not consolidated graphs over a time period.
I found a (prop.) software called netlimiter for MS-windows that
does roughly what we want. http://www.netlimiter.com/

The design of this hypothetical app for linux would be like this:
* The backend would be a daemon coupled with a kernel module that
would intercept TCP send/recv calls and log them. The data logged
would be name of the executable, user, and size of packet. The
daemon would listen on some port and pass this data on to clients
(there should be some security rules to specify which clients are
allowed to connect.) The backend should also offer a way to throttle
bandwidth in an app-wise manner. If the limit is exceeded the packet
should be dropped. The challenge is to do all this without greatly
impacting performance.

* The frontend collects this data and presents it in various pretty
ways to the user. Some examples:
  -- Show real time bandwidth usage graphs, app wise, user wise and
machine wise, both incoming and outgoing.
  -- Show aggregate graphs ala webalizer, again app wise, user wise
and machine wise.
  -- Allow throttling and bandwidth quotas.
etc.  Of course, multiple frontends can exist.

Any thoughts?

I feel you should show lot of screenshot pictures of:

1/ different destop window managers (KDE, Gnome,
Icewm, Fluxbox, Sawfish, xfce, ...)

2/ different application software (xmms, mplayer,
xine, kaffeine, GAIM [running yahoo, msn protocols],
gimp, gkrellm,...) 

3/ different distros (gentoo, red hat, suse, mandrake,
fedora core,...)

to quickly give them a good idea of what Linux is all
about! A picture is equal to a 1000 words :)

 Dear All,

   Is there any way to do bayesian filtering at the email server rather
   than each client. I know spamassassin can do by setting server wide
   and configuring a spam and ham a/c and feeding sa-learn program.

   Are there other ways of doing other than SA.

hi this is vikram,
i have installed gaim 0.59 version that comes with
RH9.

I read that users can write their function for a
signal given to a program.
What is the procedure to do so?(i.e) Say i have
written a program in C to calculate simple interest.If
i want to calculate it only on obtaining a signal say
CTRL C, How will i do it?
Also can user set his own control signals say CTRL
Z,W,E etc.If so how do i set them and associate them?
thanks in advance
bye
vikram

              The kernel in ancient AT&T unix systems was called "unix". At that time virtual memory support was not there. When berkeley rewrote the code with virtual memory support enabled, they named the kernel as "vmunix". And so, to follow the traditional naming convention, it seems, they have named the linux kernel as "vmlinux" and the compressed one as "vmlinuz".

1.3.7 is outdated and insecure.  Use 1.3.29 if you need 1.3.x

it is not a good idea to do server wide bayesian - it is best done for 
individual email addresses.

sa is the best way to do it.

Thanks for the information and it would be helpful if
u would suggest me    how to unstall apache 2.0 and
some tips to install 1.3.29 ..
my doubt is that i have apache 2.0 configured with PHP
4.3 and mysql 3.x    and running ..
will these (php and mysql) be affected while
uninstalling ..? should i make some changes in the
configuration files..?

thanks in advance

simplest thing is to remove the rpms and install the 1.3.x rpms (apache, 
mod_perl, mod_php etc)

configuration files shouldnt need too much change

Hi All,

I want to know whether it is possible to effectively network boot 10
nodes (no hard disk/cd/floppy drive) with one server running GNU/Linux.
All the 10 nodes will be powered on together. It is for an industrial
application for production data collection. Theoritically, these nodes
will never be powered off except for servicing and on weekends.

Also i want some sources where i can get info to prove to my client that
GNU/Linux can do the job.

Hey,

        Look at the source code you would most probably see some
signal(); functions.

        Thats the functionality that you need to implement yourself
for the signals that you are interested in.

        Remember that you need to enable the sighandler right after
you are done with processing the signal again as the sighandler is
cleared immediately after the sighandler is invoked upon the signal.

        That may not make sense to you. Please read about "Signal
Handling" in `info libc`.

arv

You need to have a physical extended partition in the first place then
once you have that, you need to create partitions with in that
extended partition. 

After you allocate space in terms of partitions, create a file-system
on that. Probably using mkfs..

Then you can mount it just like any other partition. 

"Linux" doesn't need any special commands to mount extended
partitions.

# mount -t type /path/to/devicefile /path/to/mountpoint

And yeah, you need to be root to execute the above command, unless you
have entries in /etc/fstab that specifies otherwise.

files in 
       /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 
 following is the error i get ..

        ]# /sbin/service httpd start
Starting httpd: grep: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf: No

Might be already  late to suggest something else to  you... but I just
got an indicom Internet connection  (its a dialup, but well, there are
no limits on  the time/bandwidth usage. All for  Rs.1500/-). The phone
also happens  to be a  nice standard modem  (yes, i configured  it for
debian using pppconfig and works like a charm :>) and unlike reliance,
the data cable  comes for free. I get an average  of 3K/s (which might
be... umm... "okay" when compared to  other ISPs but the good thing is
I  let  it  run  the  entire  night  and  seems  like  there  were  no
disconnections).

cheers,

Hmmm...I've never heard of this package, but I use something called
'ol24', which has similar features - 64kbps, unlimited downloads. The
catch is that the connection is shared between three of us in the
flat. So if u can find 2 or 3 people in ur flat who can share the
connection, u can go for this - the speeds are good, despite the
sharing.

They just keep on cable modem in a central place, and put all the
people on a LAN, with a router also in the same place as the modem.

bye,

        The basic thing required in building rpm's is that u have to write spec file. This file contains the info about the package and the instructions to build the package. Place ur src in /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/ directory. Go to /usr/src/redhat/SPEC/ directory and write a spec file for gedit. This spec file contains a lot of things to explain. 
 Visit this link http://www.rpm.org/RPM-HOWTO/build.html. Just a simple spec file is enough. Then execute rpmbuild -ba <spec file> to build ur src. If it's successful then u can get the rpm package from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/ and src rpms from /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS directory. 
 Also take at this link http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/.

<DIV>&gt; I have gedit.tar.gz and how can i build gedit as an RPM ?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basic thing required in building rpm's is that u have to write spec file. This file contains the info about the package and the instructions to build the package. Place ur src in /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/ directory. Go to /usr/src/redhat/SPEC/ directory and write a spec file for gedit. This spec file contains a lot of things to explain. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;Visit this link <A href="http://www.rpm.org/RPM-HOWTO/build.html">http://www.rpm.org/RPM-HOWTO/build.html</A>. Just a simple spec file is enough. Then execute rpmbuild -ba &lt;spec file&gt; to build ur src. If it's successful then u can get the rpm package from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/ and src rpms from /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS directory. </DIV>

My  friend in Adyar  used to  have somesuch  similar "catch"  with his
cable  ISP.  The  problem is  that these  ISPs use  a network  HUB (of
course they cannot afford a switch) and when there are more than three
people willing to subscribe, they happily  put all of them on the same
hub resulting in a slower Internet experience.

The following perl script works fine from the command line....

The 'job' was described in the first part of my mail...
I want to know whether it is possible to effectively network boot 10
nodes (no hard disk/cd/floppy drive) with one server running GNU/Linux.
All the 10 nodes will be powered on together.

It's worse for me too! i wont get my payments! :-) (It's a turnkey
project...)

Actually now that i am convinced that LTSP can do the job, i am trying
hard to push this project. Acceptance of linux in this line seems very
low, the problem being support. A medium sized manufacturing firm
generaly has 1 or 2 EDP people, and it is very rare that they want/know
about GNU/linux's capacities.

So if there is one or two successful projects which i can show to these
people, they will be more convinced.

Subject: [Ilugc] Regarding PCI IDE controller!
Message-ID: <40A1DACD.1060204@symonds.net>

I am planning to buy a PCI IDE controller to connect two more hard disk 
drives (I already have two hard disk drives, a CD writer and a DVD ROM 
connected to the motherboard's IDE controller).

Did anyone have this setup working before in Linux? Will there be any 
problem in configuring this hardware and accessing the 5th and 6th IDE 
devices under Linux?

Also, will the transfer rate be same as the hard disk drives that are 
connected to the motherboard's IDE controller?

Thanks,
Praveen.

    If memory serves me right[0], originally UNIX had it's kernel
named as unix. It was later renamed to vmunix when virtual memory was
added to the kernel's feature list.


    Following this tradition, the linux kernel was called vmlinux. The
'z' is because the kernel is gzipped. If your machine is any better
than a 486, your kernel is always bzipped rather than gzipped nowadays
(and hence, make bzImage.)

        Ganesh


[0] I have this really old book from the early-80's on unix which
    definitely should have more information on this. I can check this
    out if you want me to.

I think someone in this group has specifically mentioned that the 'bz' in
'bzImage' does *not* mean it is bzipped.

  You should consider EMACS not as an editor, but rather as a bytecode
interpreter. In a way, this makes it a platform (like Java or the
CLR).


  EMACS is insanely powerful. I spend most of my "productive" time in
EMACS. Some of the things I use it for:


    * VM: Arguably one of the best IMAP clients out there. Extensible,
      so I have hooks to sa-learn.

    * JDEE: I haven't found any alternatives which is not a memory
      hog. With tags, style checker, javadoc helpers, what more do you
      need.

    * Programming: C/C++ with ecb. Built in debugger frontends for
      [gj]db. Integrated support for CVS, Subversion and Arch, all of
      them within a couple of keystrokes. Assembler mode puts
      Metrowerks to shame.

    * Emacs Code Browser.

    * GNUS: NNTP and as an aggregator.

    * Listening to music with EMMS.

    * ERC: Better than irssi IMHO.

    * Prototyping LISP program in ELISP. I haven't been able to wrap
      my head around CL so much, unfortunately. ELISP is a decent
      implementation, and if you don't use any of ELISP's specific
      features, LISP programs are one of the fastest programs on
      earth. CL has bignums and complex data types: very good for
      numerical computation.

    * Frontends for Octave and Maxima [*]. Yup, thats TeX.

    * AucTex with preview-latex.

    * SPICE mode.

    * nxml mode - on the fly xml document validator.

    * Preparing neat text documents - usually for minutes and such;
      gathers a lot of respect from people who use console email apps.

    * w3(m): Popup blocking, tabbed browsing, typeahead search, ...

    * Ofcourse, my complete website uses emacs-wiki and a bunch of
      custom extensions specifically for my needs (Embedded LaTeX in
      webpages comes to mind.)


    peace,

        Ganesh

Hi,

I just saw my project website ... an 8085 simulator
which I programmed with interest when I was doing the
microprocessor course.  Of course, now I am no longer
interested in developing it.

FYI, it was written using GTK+.

If you like to maintain this project mail me <rsridhar

snapshot and SF project admin account.

Project site:

Downloads stats are quite nice .. seems like there is
some liking for this project.

Depends on -

1. The maximum message size configured by the mailserver you use to send 
email

2. The maximum message size configured by the mailserver your friend 
uses to receive his email

If either of these is < 10 MB you can't send it by email.

Try to split the file and compress it as multiple zip files, or just 
upload it to an ftp site somewhere, for example.

That indeed is correct. I didn't know that until I tried searching for
it and hit upon this link:

Hi,

  I followed the below link to sort a set of Items.  I have kept
that Items in a HashMap rather then List(this is my requirement).  It
works perfectly ok but some items get lost while doing
sorting.  I would love to have some comments as to why its happening.

I would request the list admin to block the plaxo.com domain from 
sending mail to the list server.

That's an "online address book" system that has serious privacy 
concerns, and doesnt work too well when someone goes and sets outlook 
express to "add all people who i reply to, to my address book" - 
especially in the context of mailing lists and spoofed mail from viruses

By the way, what happened to good old pen and paper?
If you ask me, if a persons name is not so important to enter your
address book(the one made of paper), it ain't worth preserving at all.

Message-ID: <20040514045927.73258.qmail@web61208.mail.yahoo.com>

Hai,
 I have done the following

 i) Create keys by using ssh-keygen without supplying
a password (hit enter when asked for a password).This
will create id_dsa and id_dsa.pub in ~/.ssh directory
(Host A) 
ii) Copy the contents of id_dsa.pub into
   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on Host B. 

After that I am able to ssh from hostA to host B by
using the same user without pwd. 

But I need to do ssh from hostA to host B by using
different user without pwd. 

I tried many times, but still it prompts for pwd. 

Can you please help me to solve my problem?

Sarav

I am the perpetrator of this "sin" guys, and I am sorry for it.
I am a user of this service, but that didn't grant me the right to send a
mail to all my contacts, particularly mails to user-groups like these. Made
a mistake of not reviewing the list it showed me, before hitting send.
Sorry again.

Rajendran.

this sounds like a completely different user of plaxo - the from is 
"balachandar"

i didnt notice yours ... i've got a filter that auto-deletes plaxo mail 
on the thunderbird on my PC, but i'm currently using my laptop where i 
don't have that filter installed. so saw this guy's plaxo email

your pub key should be available in target userid's
.ssh/authorized_keys. ie on otheruser@hostB.

Also you shoud use ssh -l otherusername

look a permission for .ssh/authorized_keys. It should be 700.

If you wish to do ssh from Host A to Host B by using different user
without password, copy .ssh/id_rsa (private key) of first user to the
.ssh directory of that user.=20

It is advised that the permission of .ssh should be 700 and id_rsa
should be 600.

On the other hand, you can also generate another private/public key pair
for that user -:)

Hope it helps.

Had anyone been successfull in compiling and using
Pctel drivers under Linux 2.6.x?

Too many irritating experiences when trying to get my
Gentoo (2.6.3) linux system connect to Internet!!
Of course, without Internet using Gentoo is a total
waste.

I tried these drivers but in vain

and 0.9.6-9

The kernel module + user space daemon sounds good.  Your ideas could be
added on to existing projects such as LIDS (www.lids.org) and se-linux
(from the NSA).  These guys have extensively patched the kernel to allow
various kinds of process monitoring, control and logging.

If all you need to do is to trap/intercept syscalls, a 100% userland
based approach is also feasible. strace(1) does precisely this.

The userland only approach offers the following advantages -

  1. cross platform, should work on any sane unix.
  2. stability, no messing with the kernel.
  3. only monitored application suffers a performance penalty.
     everything else runs at native speed.
  4. you avoid certain types of errors which could send your monitoring
     application into an infinite loop (eg. when the monitoring app
     monitors itself).
  5. to improve performance, it's easy to build log cacheing.
     Accumulate counters in RAM and dump to disk periodically.

RRDTool is a nice application for storing and visualizing your data.

I am looking for an Internet connection well supported
on linux, with the following condtions.

1. It should be available in Velachery (both DIAS and
hathway fails in this regard)

2. The device provided should have drivers in linux
(Touchtel provide unsupported USB modems.  But claim
their routers for a price of Rs. 6000/- !! with works
in linux)

3. Hours usage shouldn't be counted.  May bandwidth
can be counted. (So no dialup please)

I have no idea about Dishnet.  Another option is to
pay Touchtel Rs. 6000 (for router) (and Rs. 2000 for
reigstration, installation) to get a 350MB + 200
pulses line for Rs. 1000 per month.
I can use the USB modem under Windows, but that's
_useless_ anyways.

Any thoughts?

Hello all,

I have just been speaking to the Asan Memorial School people about
allowing us to host our LDD/Install fest in their school.  They are
happy to offer us their auditorium or a few class rooms (our choice).

There is a small fee involved in using their facilities.  However, my
company is happy to sponsor the entire sum, so the lug gets the space
for free.

Asan Memorial School is centrally located on, Anderson Road, Cochin
House.  For those who are unfamiliar with the location, this is near
Greams Road in Egmore.

Should we agree to this venue, we must select the date/time for the
occassion.  I will have to coordinate with Asan at the earliest to
ensure that their facilities will be available for our use.

Servers, Desktops moved to RHEL

CBI has been a pioneer in the usage of IT and recently moved its entire 
computing infrastructure to Red Hat. CBI has executed successfully on a 
formidable challenge. By migrating to a completely new operating system, 
database and TBA application across 1,115 branches, the bank has conclusively 
proved that Linux is ready for enterprise desktops and servers even in a 
decentralized environment. In fact, CBI has made it mandatory that going 
forward all its applications should be on the Linux platform. The bank now 
plans to deploy Red Hat Enterprise Linux across all the remaining branches 
too. The bank also plans to deploy Linux across 23 Regional Rural Banks that 
it controls. These banks consist of 1,770 branches and over 5,000 computers. 
The cost savings expected through the deployment of Linux is therefore 
substantial.

Beyond cost savings, the bank also aims to empower its people through 
technology. "We want to deploy this technology even in remote branches and 
free our people from repetitive tasks so that they can focus on customer 
service and other activities that help grow the bank," says Raghuraman.

I am actually getting a Touchtel connection (350 MB
limit) with the router. I definitely can't download
movies like what I do now (a movie a day :-p), but, it
will serve my purpose of browsing and chatting. 

Of course, I will have to "emerge sync" and "emerge
-uDav world" once a month and just have to pay for the
extra MB that I overshoot. Using personal systems in
companies will depend on their security policy. Some
companies allow you to use their network (I wish I end
up here), others don't.

Touchtel only counts bandwidth.

I did enquire about dishnet. Their marketing person
took days to reply back. They would only go with
external USB modem to windoze. I'd rather nuke my
machine instead. They have terrible plan offers.

both touchtel and dishnet do offer "router" plans.

don't ask for "linux" connections, ask for "routers"

or poke around on http://eciadsl.flashtux.org or other sites where you 
get linux drivers for the windows based usb modems you are given.

Its very easy

On u r menu go to 'system settings' -> 'server settings' -> 'services'
On the left side will be the currently active services running on the 
machine. See if webmin is active. If not click on the webmin and then 
click start. A confirmation Services started successfully will appear. 
To do all this u should be the root user.

Now open your mozilla and type: http://localhost:10000/

That is all. You can log in with root user.

Message-ID: <1084712209.40a76511d6bba@webmail.rawbw.com>

Folks:

I have been trying to get a Broadband connection to my home in R.A. Puram for a
month now.  Haven't succeeded.  I thought I'd share my experiences.

1. Dishnet.  I was in touch with the sales representative Preeti Menon.  She put
me in touch with some technical personnel after several weeks worth of email
exchanges.  The experience was unpleasant.

Dishnet claims to offer the fastest residential broadband at 512 kb/s.  Their
residential package features USB modems from Aztech and Centillium.  These come
with Windows drivers only.  They claim that they've tested with Linux and it
doesn't work.  Won't work with Win2K or any non-Windows OS.  Price of package:
Rs. 7000 registration (one time) + Rs. 1000 (monthly).  These charges include
modem rental.  Modems cannot be purchased outright.

For Linux and UNIX (which they assume is only for corporate use), they offer
corporate router service (Motorola Broadmax router).  Cost: Rs. 50K
(registration) + Rs. 1000 (monthly).  Alternatively, Rs. 15K (registration) +
Rs. 1200 (monthly) for however many months to reach a registration of Rs. 50K
(essentially, registration is paid through instalments).

They openly stated that there is virtually no demand for Linux client support
and their folks are not planning to ask the vendors for Linux drivers for their
USB modems.

Their sales folks don't know what they're talking about.  They were confused
whether their offering is cable based or DSL based!

2. Touchtel.  They offer USB ADSL modems.  Windows drivers only.  Their service
offerings are in the range 128-256 kb/s.  For Linux clients, they offer a
router.  Cost: Rs. 10K (registration) + Rs. 6K (purchase of router) + plan fee.
 Plan fee varies from hundreds to thousands of rupees per month depending on the
speed and max. transfer per month.  Rental plans are available for the router.

Touchtel service comes with a phone line whether you want it or not.

Touchtel cell phone centers do not know anything about their broadband service.

3. Hathway.  They are not offering service to my home.  Their plan features an
RJ45 Ethernet connection as the endpoint.  OS agnostic.  Their plan has a
registration fee of Rs. 1K.  The 100MB/month 128 kb/s plan costs Rs. 300/month
or Rs. 3000/year.  The SMTP charge that they advertise on their website is not
applicable to Chennai.

4. Sify.  Their connection is the most peculiar.  Whereas other services run a
cable to the endpoint, Sify connects the endpoint to their equipment on the
rooftop which wirelessly communicates with similar equipment at the rooftop of
the local cable operator.  The endpoint is RJ45 Ethernet -- OS agnostic.  Their
services offers 64-256 kb/s.  Monthly rates vary.  Registration and installation
fee is max. Rs. 3500 but could be lower if they have provisioned service for
others in the area.

The sales personnel will state that they have transferred your case to local
marketing executives for feasibility determination.  These marketing executives
are supposed to get in touch with the customer within a day or two.  You'll be
lucky if you ever hear from them.

------------------------

None of these providers care to woo the customer or keep him/her happy.  The
customer is expected to call repeatedly to find the status of his/her case.

All in all, it has been a very frustrating experience.  I'm forced to stick with
VSNL dialup for the moment.

Aztech / Centillium USB dsl modems do have third party drivers for

Googling through linux list archives would have showed you several hits 
on that url, or just google for "dishnet dsl linux" :)

I suggest that you upgrade immediately to 2.6.6. This version has
several bug-fixes and I found it to be much more stable than prior
versions of 2.6.x.

Had anyone been successfull in compiling and using

Too many irritating experiences when trying to get my
Gentoo (2.6.3) linux system connect to Internet!!
Of course, without Internet using Gentoo is a total
waste.

I tried these drivers but in vain

Subject: [Ilugc] Linux Compatible Mice??
Message-ID: <20040517035527.98039.qmail@web12704.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,

My mouse is dying. It either doent click or
double-clicks so fast that I'm closing windows sooner
than I can open them.

Tired of the normal 3-button mouse,I'm looking for a 5
button, optical,scroll mouse,PS/2.

I've narrowed the options to the following

1.Microsoft IntelliMouse
http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=26-105-122&depa=0

2.Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer
http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=26-105-142&depa=0

3.Logitech MX500
http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=26-104-129&depa=0

4.Logitech MX310
http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=26-104-136&depa=0

Are the features mentioned in the above mice supported
in Linux. I'm pretty sure the Microsoft mice will
never work properly and I could never get them to work
with all those extra features.

What about the Logitech ones?

Anyone has one of these? 
Do mail in your comments.

Bye,

Did you try opening up the mouse and cleaning the ball and rollers? :)

About ps2 scroll miles - i'd suggest either the microsoft intellimouse or the
logitech one (both scroll mice)

there might be some life in the mouse still if you poke around with a sharp
pin under the buttons and dig out tons of dirt you never imagined existed :)

Subject: [LIG] #linux-india IRC channel

We have started an experiment by putting up a #linux-india IRC channel
on irc.freenode.net . Even as I write this at 10:00 AM in the morning,
we have a brisk discussion going on in the channel. Please do join us. 

Bhaskar has written a micro-howto on how you can join us. 

micro-howto to show you how to get hooked to #linux-india
---------------------------------------------------------

The #linux-india IRC channel is up and running on
irc.freenode.net. Please visit or idle in the channel to make it
better.

This micro-howto will show you how to get hooked to #linux-india:

1. Get hold of an IRC (internet relay chat) client. Some of the good
ones are:

bitchx - Advanced Internet Relay Chat client
ircii - Internet Relay Chat client
xchat - IRC client for X similar to AmIRC
xchat-gnome - IRC client for GNOME similar to AmIRC
mozilla-chatzilla - Mozilla Web Browser - irc client
kvirc - Fully scriptable graphical IRC client with plugin support
konversation - user friendly Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client for KDE

2.  connect to irc.freenode.net with your favourite IRC client (
please remember not to run irc as *root* unless you are on crack) for
example, if you are running bitchx, type the following on a prompt:
$bitchx irc.freenode.net

3. Once you get online, register your nick. First see that your nick
is what you want. if its not, type:
/nick <your_nick>

then register the nick:
/msg nickserv register <your_password>

4. to join the linux-india channel, type :
/join #linux-india

Thats it. If this is the first time you are using IRC, you can see the
IRC Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and Help Files
(http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/faq.html) for a more detailed
introduction. For more, ask for help in the channel.

Bhaskar

I did try that. managed to get some dirt out still the
buttons problem is not fixed.

Made a couple of calls to Ritchie Street and found out
that the IntelliMouse Explorer is never "in-stock" and
usually takes a couple of days if one needs it.

Gave up and got the Logitech Optical Mouse (plain
vanilla one).

I was just wondering if anyone have made those
additional buttons to work with linux.

It says they can be programmed to perform multiple
tasks like Back/Forward in Web Browsers. But it also
mentions Internet Explorer 5 and above in the System
Requirements.

I just dont want to plunk down 2000 bucks for a mouse
and end up with 4 additional buttons that just are of
no use in Linux.

Great for FPS shooters though.

Subject: [Ilugc] Re: about webmin

Its very easy

On u r menu go to 'system settings' -> 'server settings' -> 'services'
On the left side will be the currently active services running on the 
machine. See if webmin is active. If not click on the webmin and then 
click start. A confirmation Services started successfully will appear. 
To do all this u should be the root user.

Now open your mozilla and type: http://localhost:10000/

That is all. You can log in with root user.

I'd like to learn Linux but need the help of somebody. Does anybody

Subject: [Ilugc] Re: possible internet connection in linux

Folks:

I have been trying to get a Broadband connection to my home in R.A. Puram for a
month now. Haven't succeeded. I thought I'd share my experiences.

1. Dishnet. I was in touch with the sales representative Preeti Menon. She put
me in touch with some technical personnel after several weeks worth of email
exchanges. The experience was unpleasant.

Dishnet claims to offer the fastest residential broadband at 512 kb/s. Their
residential package features USB modems from Aztech and Centillium. These come
with Windows drivers only. They claim that they've tested with Linux and it
doesn't work. Won't work with Win2K or any non-Windows OS. Price of package:
Rs. 7000 registration (one time) + Rs. 1000 (monthly). These charges include
modem rental. Modems cannot be purchased outright.

For Linux and UNIX (which they assume is only for corporate use), they offer
corporate router service (Motorola Broadmax router). Cost: Rs. 50K
(registration) + Rs. 1000 (monthly). Alternatively, Rs. 15K (registration) +
Rs. 1200 (monthly) for however many months to reach a registration of Rs. 50K
(essentially, registration is paid through instalments).

They openly stated that there is virtually no demand for Linux client support
and their folks are not planning to ask the vendors for Linux drivers for their
USB modems.

Their sales folks don't know what they're talking about. They were confused
whether their offering is cable based or DSL based!

2. Touchtel. They offer USB ADSL modems. Windows drivers only. Their service
offerings are in the range 128-256 kb/s. For Linux clients, they offer a
router. Cost: Rs. 10K (registration) + Rs. 6K (purchase of router) + plan fee.
Plan fee varies from hundreds to thousands of rupees per month depending on the
speed and max. transfer per month. Rental plans are available for the router.

Touchtel service comes with a phone line whether you want it or not.

Touchtel cell phone centers do not know anything about their broadband service.

3. Hathway. They are not offering service to my home. Their plan features an
RJ45 Ethernet connection as the endpoint. OS agnostic. Their plan has a
registration fee of Rs. 1K. The 100MB/month 128 kb/s plan costs Rs. 300/month
or Rs. 3000/year. The SMTP charge that they advertise on their website is not
applicable to Chennai.

4. Sify. Their connection is the most peculiar. Whereas other services run a
cable to the endpoint, Sify connects the endpoint to their equipment on the
rooftop which wirelessly communicates with similar equipment at the rooftop of
the local cable operator. The endpoint is RJ45 Ethernet -- OS agnostic. Their
services offers 64-256 kb/s. Monthly rates vary. Registration and installation
fee is max. Rs. 3500 but could be lower if they have provisioned service for
others in the area.

The sales personnel will state that they have transferred your case to local
marketing executives for feasibility determination. These marketing executives
are supposed to get in touch with the customer within a day or two. You'll be
lucky if you ever hear from them.

------------------------

None of these providers care to woo the customer or keep him/her happy. The
customer is expected to call repeatedly to find the status of his/her case.

All in all, it has been a very frustrating experience. I'm forced to stick with
VSNL dialup for the moment.

Aztech / Centillium USB dsl modems do have third party drivers for 
linux. http://eciadsl.flashtux.org

Googling through linux list archives would have showed you several hits 
on that url, or just google for "dishnet dsl linux" :)

I suggest that you upgrade immediately to 2.6.6. This version has
several bug-fixes and I found it to be much more stable than prior
versions of 2.6.x.

Had anyone been successfull in compiling and using
Pctel drivers under Linux 2.6.x?

Too many irritating experiences when trying to get my
Gentoo (2.6.3) linux system connect to Internet!!
Of course, without Internet using Gentoo is a total
waste.

I tried these drivers but in vain

Subject: [Ilugc] Linux Compatible Mice??

Hi,

My mouse is dying. It either doent click or
double-clicks so fast that I'm closing windows sooner
than I can open them.

Tired of the normal 3-button mouse,I'm looking for a 5
button, optical,scroll mouse,PS/2.

I've narrowed the options to the following

1.Microsoft IntelliMouse
http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=26-105-122&depa=0

2.Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer
http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=26-105-142&depa=0

3.Logitech MX500
http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=26-104-129&depa=0

4.Logitech MX310
http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=26-104-136&depa=0

Are the features mentioned in the above mice supported
in Linux. I'm pretty sure the Microsoft mice will
never work properly and I could never get them to work
with all those extra features.

What about the Logitech ones?

Anyone has one of these? 
Do mail in your comments.

there might be some life in the mouse still if you poke around with a sharp
pin under the buttons and dig out tons of dirt you never imagined existed :)

hello,
        I want to use NCSA based auth with IP of machines.
I am using now only IP for acl as follows :

acl abc src 192.168.0.1
http_access allow abc

I want to add say username and password also for auth
using NCSA.

I believe I need to add the following line in squid.conf

authenticate_program /usr/local/squid/bin/ncsa_auth 
/usr/local/squid/etc/passwd

I am not sure exactly where to add the above line.

Futher I need to create the file passwd in

/usr/local/squid/etc/

Howto add username and password to the file passwd?

What should I add to my present acl in squid.conf to add
NCSA auth with username and password ?


Thanks in advance

There is nothing very new about this. An old IOS (11.some-early-version) 
was leaked several years back.

Routing protocols etc are not a "black art" - there are more than enough 
open source implementations around.

There's no big risk here.

See nanog archives (www.nanog.org) for some more informed discussion on 
this (dont waste your time reading slashdot)

Speed is very good than the normal telephone internet connection. they will
give u 10/100Mbps ethernet and i think u might get 24kbps . it is something
like network with a particular area.

here is the phone number

yes you are right. for that u must have a BSNL First Hand Connection

One more thing, its all dialup connection. the one i am telling is
connection based on ethernet cable in residential areas.

two of my friends are utilising it.

i dont have luck since that facility is not available in adyar.

In your '/etc/hosts' file add an entry to your hostname

Eg:

127.0.0.1	localhost	localhost.localdomain
10.0.0.15	linserv		linserv.somedomain

(OR)

127.0.0.1	localhost	localhost.localdomain	linserv

This should make name resolving work.

Subject: [Ilugc] Just my $0.02 on Fedora Core 2!
Message-ID: <40AC5DD8.6050904@symonds.net>

I downloaded the ISO images of FC2 from mirrors.kernel.org, which was 
relatively less busy yesterday. The download took about 2 hours and 40 
minutes for 5 CDs (4 Binaries + 1 Rescue).

I didn't see much change in the installer. I was really surprised to see 
the slide show (release notes images) showing up only one image always 
saying that "RedHat wants to thank the Fedora community for it's 
woderful work last year".

My monitor "Samsung Samtron 55E" was detected as "Unknown monitor". I am 
really wondering why is it so. Even RedHat 7.3 installer detects it 
correctly. I found the same problem with RH9, FC1 and it continues in 
FC2 also. May be my monitor has become obsolette?!

Although SELinux is there in Fedora, inorder to enable it, we have to 
say "selinux" at the boot prompt of the installer. Since I didn't read 
the documents related to SELinux, I didn't want to give a try to it.

Once installation completed, the system booted with Linux kernel 2.6 
another major change in Fedora's release. This time, they added a new 
command line 'quiet' in addition to the 'rhgb' to trim the kernel 
messages showed up.

One of the major change is that XFree is replaced by Xorg. I am not sure 
of the technical differences between these two. But as an end user, I 
can see improved performance using Xorg. Especially, font are nicely 
rendered.

GDM is the default DM again. First I gave a try to GNOME 2.6. Things are 
improved. But up to what I saw, nautilus is screwed up. Every folder is 
opened in a separate window. I hate this (Windows NT 4) style. I am 
really wondering if we can change it. To my fear, I got the answer NO 
from googling.

Then I tried KDE 3.2. Now a days, I am getting drifted towards KDE from 
GNOME. The first application I tried in KDE was KIIIB to test my CD 
burner. As the writer was not under SCSI emulation, it was not detected 
by KIIIB. I tried rebooting with SCSI emulation for my CD burner with 
command line 'hdc=ide-scsi'. But still the writer is not under SCSI 
emulation. Since ide-scsi is deprecated for CD writing, I think Fedora 
decided to remove the ide-scsi module? I am not sure anyway.

Still Fedora doesn't have capabilty for MP3, DVDs, etc. I planned to 
compile the Mplayer source that I used under Debian Sarge. Hey, it 
worked fine! I played the Matrix 'all in one' DVD without any pain.

I got my nVidia nForce ethernet controller, nVidia nForce audio working 
properly by default. I tried installing the nVidia properiatry driver 
for X to get the best out of hardware acceleration for my nVidia GeForce 
2 IGP. But in vain! The installer didn't find any precompiled interface 
for the kernel of FC2. I compiled one and the install was sucessful. But 
when I started X, the system black out and I have to reboot to get out 
of this. There was no pain in configuring the driver for Debian Sarge 
runnign on kernel 2.6.4 with the same installer though. I suspect the 
reason that Xorg instead of XFree is creating some problem. Googling 
didn't gave me much. I have to sort this down soon.

One thing I noticed during shutdown is that console mouse services 
shutdown suceeds unlike FC1.

Overall FC2 is a significant release in the Fedora's roadmap.

Praveen.

   Spatial view is actually a good one.  But it takes
time to settle up with that. See

> [snip . about scsi emulation ]

   2.6.x no longer supports SCSI emulation for IDE. 
Latest (patched) version of cdrecord allows u to burn
the cd directly.  Try
   $ cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc ....


I though of downloading all 9 ISOs, now I am going to

But I got in working in my Debian when I compiled kernel 2.6.4 myself. 
It just gave a kernel message that ide-scsi is obsolette for cd writing 
and use ide-cd instead.

XFree 4.x dropped support for a lot of "old" monitors. Unfortunately,
a lot of hardware that gets obsoleted in the west finds a new market
in India.

SELinux was enabled by default in FC2test2, but it proved to be such a 
can of worms that they regressed in test3 and final. Which is just one
instance of the more general principle that security is a process, not
a product. One 6-month period is too short to make and test the system-
wide changes that SELinux requires.

Moving in the general direction of MS-Windows, I see :-) But I'm not
complaining about such changes as long as its not forced on you.

Uhmm.. are you sure? The difference is probably due to something else.
X.org is merely a fork of XFree of the version before they changed the
license, and IIRC there are currently *no* technical differences between
XFree and X.org.

No, you got it wrong. Spatial Nautilus has got to be the most misunderstood
user interface in the history of computing. Its basically a new approach
to file management that works by removing the distinction in the user's
mind between a folder and a view of the folder. However, to do that, you
need to use it for a while. See

I think nVidia will release the precompiled interface in a month or two.
I heard that Linus deliberately breaks binary compatibility to make it
more difficult for closed source drivers to exist. Strange, considering
that he has repeatedly professed his political apathy.

Q: Do you ever think about quantum computing?  
Linus: I think that's a load of bull.
(From a Linux Lunacy cruise interview. After the presumptuous disparagement
of QC, Linus goes on to confuse it with DNA computing.)

Anyways, my monitor is almost 5 years old. I am planning to buy an 17" LCD.

I am not really sure on the reason. But I could see the difference 
between FC1 and FC2.

Thanks for this useful info.

I know this. One of my doubt is that how come Debian Sarge comes with 
support to MP3? It has Xine as well and it plays DVDs wonderfuly.

> I think nVidia will release the precompiled interface in a month or two.

I can't wait till that. I saw some Slack users got their nVidia driver 
up on Xorg.

This will create a big mess for nVidia and ATI users if it is going to 
happen.

Hi srinivas,
                  Thanks, I have got it working.
But I have yet to achieve fully my goal.
I have proxy working using client IP :

acl authentic   src a.b.c.d
http_access allow authentic

I have proxy working using NCSA with username and password :

acl authentic   proxy_auth      REQUIRED
http_access allow authentic

What I want is client IP + username and password.

Howto combine the two ?

Thanks in advance

Varun

Read the INSTALL/README file and Carefully Install the GCC. Otherwise 
during installation it will overwrite the already existing lib file :)

I donot want you to help me instead I wanted to help you out. What I 
expect from any administrator when they know that their domain name or 
email address(es) are used for malicious purpose by another domain is 
that to contact the respective IP address' administrator to file an 
abuse report so that you are least expected to find a misbehavior from 
the same IP in the future. That's why I attached the 'whois' lookup. If 
you are too busy to do that, that's OK. I have good spam filters and 
daily anti-virus updates and security patches updates on my machine and 
I am least bothered about my machine. I can't help if my mail was a bit 
hard.

You know something?  Filing these reports for random virus bounces, 
instead of just filtering out the viruses and leaving them alone would 
be the best possible idea. Ditto with spoofed spam. There's just too 
much of it, and there are just 24 hours in the day for you to get work done.

Finding and shutting off individual virus sources on what looks like a 
large broadband network on a case by case basis, based on complaints, is 
a time sink.  Getting ISPs to implement preventive measures (decent spam 
and virus filtering, ACL'ing off "dangerous" ports across a home 
broadband network, etc) is a better idea.

Message-ID: <20040521153128.58328.qmail@web50210.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi!

Consider this scenario:

One system having 2 NICs and each one is directly
connected to a different ISP with a unique IP address
(say aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa and bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb). It is a
direct connection (say through modem) and not going
through any local router. 

Suppose I start a service in the system, to which IP
address does it get bound to? For example, say if I
start a ssh daemon, it should get bound to a port and
an IP address to form a socket. So which NIC will be
chosen? and what decides which NIC will be chosen?

Suppose, the sshd runs on aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa:22 socket. I
can change the default gateway route entry in the
route table so that all packets that are sent go from
the bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb IP address. Now, will I be able to
ssh into my system from the bbb.bbb.bbb.bbb address to
the ssh daemon running on aaa.aaa.aaa.aaa address
through the Internet?

Thanks,

Shaks

Message-ID: <20040521185345.5516cf71.srikanthns@vsnl.com>

Hi All,
I intend to purchase a Reliance Fixed Wireless Phone (FWP).
It contains an inbuilt modem. It can be used to connect to
WEb and surf. In their website, it details the steps to 
connect to R World and mentions the compatible OS's as
Win 98, 2000 and XP. Linux is not mentioned.

I asked their marketing people here in Trivandrum. First response
was " it will not work in Linux". Then they told that they will
enquire and get back to me.  I very much doubt whether their
marketing people will come up with a solution to an involved 
technical problem.
Is it possible to use REliance FWP in Linux? If this issue is
 already  discussed with solutions, can somebody post a link?

Thanks in advance

N S Srikanth

hi,

a couple of days back I inquired about the Microsoft
Intellimouse's support in Linux.

Will with the Mozilla 1.8 Alpha version (released 2
days back) the two additional buttons are now
supported.

The buttons had the Forward and Backward Functionality
in Internet Explorer for Windows.

People who are using this mouse can get the new
Mozilla version and try it out.

Still dont know if GNOME supports them.

Here's a list of the changes in Mozilla 1.8 Alpha 1.

have fun,

Unless you specifically provide sshd an interface to bind to, it will 
bind to all available interfaces on that machine.

This is true of most other daemons.

After that it is up to you to set the gateway for the IP on each interface.

ident lookups, which might be blocked by a firewall at your end or the 
isp's end, and then if the IP you are ssh'ing from doesn't have reverse 
DNS (ptr record) that's another factor for delay.

Another reason might be the multiple round trips involved in authentication
(challenge-response or something like that).

  Some time before, Praveen mailed here an article

mentioned in that article that "Brown and Tanenbaum
say Linus is not the real author". 
 But, Tanenbaum has clearly mentioned in his site that
he didnt mention anything so and abt "who is the

Ken Brown, President of the Alexis de Tocqueville

Hi,

For those of you who missed out this poll on Slashdot.

http://slashdot.org/pollBooth.pl?qid=1116&aid=4

Read through and you could find some good variants for
your PS1.

here's a good one:
export PS1="\u@\h \[\e[33m\]\W\[\e[0m\] \[\`if [[ \$?
= "0" ]]; then echo
'\e[32m=)\e[0m'; else echo '\e[31m=(\e[0m' ; fi\`\] \$
"

gives you:
1.Login
2.Hostname
3.Time in colour
4.an interactive smiley which gives you :) for a
successful command and a :( for an error.

have fun,
toufeeq

So how can I install or configure the user manager or in Novell Network
Administrator like that. Clients are windows 98, 2k and xp. The clients
have already windows 2000 AS logins.

We have 128 Kbs leased line with ISP, I need to install squid. Please
inform me how to install and configure the settings.

Thanks in advance,

I did the following:
1. make mrproper
2. make xconfig
3.make dep
4.make clean
5.make bzImage

I compiled the already existing kernel on my FC1
system.

any ideas what went wrong?

TIA,

Depends on the display manager you use.  If you use gdm / kdm, you can
configure it  through their front-ends to  do so... but  why would you
want to login as root? sudo does  the job for me whenever i need to do
things as root.

Put   the  option   'defaults'   in   the   options  field   in   your
/etc/fstab. man fstab for more details.

I845 is very  well supported by XFree86. Probably you  have asked X to
use   very   "safe"    Horizontal   Frequencies.   fiddle   with   the
frequencies... :)

Seems like the order is wrong.  `make clean` should be
done before `make xconfig`.

well, the problem is solved. got the kernel
compiled.Googling a LOT on deja.com helped.many FC1
users have had this "kallsyms" problem.

how do i test if the new "custom" kernel is better
than the "packaged" one?

any utilities to test the new kernel for optimization
differences?

thnx,
toufeeq

You're (probably) using older version of GTK+, either
1.2 or 2.0.  Either upgrade your Gtk+ or upgrade the
whole distro.

Wget is so incredibly good that it is considered somewhat blasphemous
to write a downloader yourself :-) So most of the "download managers"
for Unix that you'd find are nothing more than pretty wget frontends.
Anything that's not a wget frontend is likely to be far inferior.

You need to install the xmms-mp3 plugin.

You have to buy it.

Redistributing RHEL would be piracy.

If  you join  RHCE course,  you  get the  media.  But  you should  not
redistribute that.

Not that I agree with everything RMS says, but surely we don't want
to propagate a word that was invented for purely FUD reasons by our

I don't claim to be a gnu zealot.  But -

1. Microsoft is just a competitor to Linux. Maybe a competitor that 
plays dirty once in a while.  Making this some sort of war is not going 
to be of any use at all.

2. Any other name for "unauthorized redistribution of copyrighted 
software, explicitly against its license"?

Since GNU Philosophy and the GPL give the freedom to fork, it would be 
unfair to use an expression like `gnu zealot' - because it makes no 
sense.  The GNU philosophy and the GPL permit other developers and 
people to change and modify the source code, and those who give you such 
freedom could never be labelled as zealots.

Are you talking about zealotry here?

>

> software, explicitly against its license"?

Our Copyright Act deals only with `copyright infringement'.  Piracy 
refers to grave offences committed on the High Seas by pirates.

Using the word piracy in a case of mere `copyright infringement' is 
inappropriate, illegal, unlawful, defamatory, libelous and probably, 
even if copyright infringement is made out, the person baselessly 
accused to be a pirate would be within his rights to claim damages 
towards defamation and slander from the persons who make unreasonable 
accusations.

Using the right expression is important to convey our ideas with clarity 
avoiding confusion and needless harm to oneself and to others.

Regards,
Ramanraj.

Seriously, the  GNU project has given  us a lot of  useful tools. Man,
where is my life without a GCC or an emacs? :) However, one fine point
drives people  away (or even  against!) the hard  stand on the  use of
certain words like  "piracy" or..  err... "Linux".  I'm  still an avid
free software supporter..  and believe me (or ask the older folks here
on this list :)  ) I used to be a major  "call it only gnu/linux" guy.
I learnt it  the hard way that this  linux-vs-gnu-linux flaming drives
people crazy and against the  free software movement. (as in people go
around calling gnu-related people as zealots, etc.,.)

Nobody  can deny the  genius of  RMS.  Nobody  can deny  the wonderful
contribution of the Free Software  Movement, BUT, not giving the users
the comfort  of calling  it "Linux" or  using the word  "Piracy" makes
Free Software Enthusiasts smell pungent.

But thats  just my view. I'm sure  many "pure" GNU heads  might not be
convinced about this all... :) and lets not flame, please :)

This is an extreme rendition of piracy - just as how "freeing software
users" sounds. When applied to  India, I dont think "freedom to users"
is as  serious an issue  as Illiteracy, Bad  Media or Poverty.  (and I
probably already  mentioned this  in an offlist  discussion to  you :)
).  I donot  say free  software is  unimportant. Having  software that
students  can   study  /  hack  on   is  very  useful.   But  its  not
"vital". Thats all I have to say.

did you try downloader for x ?
that is in my opinion far better tha wget,axel etc etc.it has the
ability to split the download into multiple connections which axel
also does, but downloader for x does is better.

Piracy is a well known concept in International Law, that dates back to
time immemorial, ever since pirates and nations existed and even
assuming that software development started earnestly since the times of
Charles Babbage, `copyrights' for literature including computer programs
came in much later and it is really untenable to use the expression
`piracy' in matters relating to mere `copyright infrigements'.  Legally,
there is an ocean of difference between the two - to give another
analogy one cannot deal with theft and murder like they were one and the
same.  srs specifically asked for the information, and my duty ends with
sharing what I know in this regard.

The `piracy' analogy could be used another way also -  proprietary
software concerns that threaten people with: `pay up license fees, or
else...' sound more like the real pirates on the high seas who hold
people to ransom and live life by striking terror.   It is best to leave
`piracy' to where it belongs - on the high seas. Therefore, whatever it
means, we can say, "avoid the pirates - use free software !"

I have always felt that proprietary concerns can do a great favour by
dealing severly with those who deal with or use computer programs
without a proper license - there will a mass exodus over night, and many
members of this list will suddenly find themselves doing good business
and become more affluent :)

Requesting people to voluntarily use right terminology, in their own

bunch of roses - and all are free and welcome enjoy the sweet fragrance ;)

I kindly request that the issue be understood in the correct
perspective, because it would make a significant difference in disputes
that are likely to come in the future. It is best to avoid confusing
copyright infringement with piracy and best to simply use the
appropriate proper terminology.  Recently toufeeq@computer.org wrote:

<quote>

There was a patch for Xmms which enabled it to play

</quote>

mp3 files comply with the MPEG-3 coding standard, which is reportedly
`patented'.     In India, the Patents Act has specifically excluded
computer programs, schemes, algorithms, and presentation of information
from the definition of inventions and the MPEG coding standards would
have to be treated only as a literary work that could be protected by
copyright, which will enable fair use by others.  Conceding MPEG to be
an invention capable of being patented would be truly absurd, and is
neither permissible nor possible. Coding standards cannot be patented as
though they are inventions.   Imagine what would happen if I claim that
I have researched for 5 years, and found that an indent 4 spaces wide
[please read 4 as 8 if you use linux coding standards] is the most
efficient indent spacing and have a patent registered in my favour.  If
you indent with 4 spaces while writing a computer program, I can start
harassing you with various claims and some people may even lend support
to me calling you a `pirate' for using my `patent' without getting my
permission.  Regardless of the claims made by the authors, we need to be
careful in using the right legal terminology, which alone will
ultimately define our rights and privileges as users and developers of
software.  Therefore,  using correct terminology is both important and
useful.

Having a rock solid free and open operating system is the first step -
and after years of development efforts we now have the linux kernel, gnu
compiler collection, database servers, web servers, and many other
tools.  The next stept would definitely be to use these free tools to
solve other problems including the ones you have listed.  There are
several mailing lists [mostly running GNU Mailman] discussing the other
issues - and it is really only a question of time before which we will
live in a society where all are literate, good and affluent, and I won't
be surprised if in the near future free software moves people from earth
to the fartherest edges of the cosmos as we know it :)

[Oh, and even then the linux vs gnu/linux debate might be cropping up
every now and then]

 ISP, right?  That's cheap anyway.  For 100 hrs, you
have to pay Rs. 500 (sancharnet) -- and you get free
hrs during night and sundays and holidays.  you can
download more 3 GB in a month, without counting down
that 100 hrs (for 2 years)

  BTW, I hope u r paying just Rs. 500 to BSNl every
month -- do u pay anything extra to BSNl for 2nd
bfone?

  Also how many days after asking for connection you
did get it?

hello,

has anyone had this problem with 2.6.6 and nvidia
graphics cards?

When I issue the "reboot" or "halt" command in X the
whole X server crashes.

No respons to key presses(Cntrl-Alt-Del,Cntrl-AltF2
etc..)

However when I run X with the "nv" driver it
reboots/halts fine.

The problem is with the Nvidia driver.
btw, I'm runing the latest driver from nvidia.com on
my geforce4 MX440.

I also heard that support for precompiled binaries
(like the nvidia driver) will be "nerfed" in 2.6

anyone with the same problem?

Ritchie street is _the_ place, however  you have to know the vendor to

Hi,

I just underwent a painful session of debian installation which ended up
with an error!!! Is there anyway to install debian without all those

do dpkg-reconfigure debconf. It will  ask you to select the 'priority'
of  questions that  you want  to answer.  Choose 'high'.  debconf will
assume defaults for questions below the selected priority.

However, you  would miss  out on learning  about things that  you dont
know of! whether you want to learn, is a different question.

Its the question that matters....

What do you want to do with Linux?

If you want to learn how the wheels and bolts work in Linux, try Linux =
from Scratch. http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/
If you want to get a hot certification, looks towards RH
If you want a distro, which will cover whatever the result of the SCO-IP =
FUD scam will result in. Look towards SuSe.
If you really want it small and clean look towards Slackware.

Please, if you don't like Debian don't use it.  Don't start judging
people who use it because your preferences don't match theirs.  I have
no clue why you consistently want to incense Debian users.  Especially
when no one here is pushing it down everyone's throat.

I've used slackware, RH and Debian and manage several Debian machines.
I like it more than any other distro I've tried.  I've even
articulated the reasons why I like Debian on my web pages.  So, if you
have a point to make, please do so.  If its just strongly biased
opinion, you can keep it to yourself, thanks.

squid is a http proxy, not a socks proxy

set up NAT and a transparent proxy.

google for it.

You needn't say anything about people using it. If you have a set of
proper features which you think are good in your clean distros you might
state them (like Ganesh wrote about emacs [1]).

Just talk about yourself, and not about any baseless opinion you have on
others.

I really don't understand what you found to be so unclean about a Debian
install.

I have tried quite a few distros and finally settled for Debian and have
been using it for the past 2-3 years. Till today, I have found no need
to change. I find no other distro to be as simple and clean as Debian.

Well, easier to start on what I don't like about debian -

1. debconf, resulting in config files named something completely 
different than the default from the tarball, placed in different 
directories etc.

2. running daemons from inetd

3. extremely long release cycle between stable / testing / unstable so 
that the disadvantages of running antique software sometimes tend to 
outweigh the advantages of having something supposed to be very stable 
[cf: outdated exim 3 in debian stable / testing, where just about nobody 
else in the world uses exim 3, and have more or less forgotten to 
configure it]

4. a package management system that makes users so hopelessly reliant on 
it that quite a few of them are literally scared of compiling their own 
code instead of hunting for debian packages for it.  Again in the case 
of exim - lost count of the number of people who turn up saying "they 
can't upgrade because there is no exim 4 package for debian stable" 
(there's a backport by Andreas Metzler, that's a different thing ...)

Standardization.  You might not like it, but some of us find
consistency useful.  Besides, the Debian policy is very clear on what
should go where so users can't complain that they don't know where
things are installed.  dpkg -L package-name is also useful.

Hmm, so you are damned if you do and damned if you don't.  Debian has
such good package management that folks are scared to compile their
own packages for fear that their packages won't be as good.  They
expect quality.  Lots of tarballs are inconsistent, install things in
places that are non-standard, use different installers, builders and
whatnot.  This is a problem with having a lot of choice.  In any case,
the statement is true of other distros too.  There surely are a lot of
people who expect RPMs for all software and are scared stiff of
compiling their own packages (and justifiably so).  FWIW, I have over
40 packages compiled from source and installed on Debian stable boxen
I manage.  So I atleast have one case where the reverse is true.  Its
not like Debian policy forces you not to install packages from source.

Could you give an example? What has debconf got to do with the location
of config files? And what is a tarball? I have no reason to know what it
is. I only need to know about packages. If I want vim, I do "sudo apt-get
install vim". If there are any differences in the location of files,
/usr/share/doc/*/README* would contain the info.

stable has a long release cycle. But it is not so in the case of
testing/unstable. I was running a mailserver (serving around 400 people)
for a year, and I just used postfix in a stable version. I didn't have
to know what version I was running.

I am basically a home user and not an admin. I use unstable on my
computer, and I have faced no problems whatsoever. I have been running
KDE 3.2 from the moment binary packages were released. I just had to do
an apt-get.

Is that what you meant? I am scared of compiling my own code. So I use
the debian packages for it. Mostly I don't need to hunt. I just do an
"apt-cache search" and I have not faced any problems till date.

   But the packages are compiled with i386
optimizations.  Why should I go for old compiler
optimizations when I have modern hardware.  Gentoo[1]
excels in this aspect.

  But Gentoo is lot more convinient if you like
compiling the source .. and it also has binary
packages though not recommended.

  The strong point against debian is it still compiles
i386 binaries even if you want to use them with modern
hardware. Gentoo is fast.  I have Gentoo 2004.0 CDs
with me.

  I find Debian a lot more useful in servers than any
distro.  One cannot deny that.

This is not something that you just can't avoid.

Downloading a source deb and compiling it for i686 is just as possible 
as it is in gentoo / freebsd etc.

Exactly.  Ditto with freebsd and its ports tree.  When I use linux I 
stick with slackware but gentoo seems more and more attractive when I 
look at this.

I'm a fan of the *bsd ports tree system, as you might tell - it gives 
you far more flexiblity than a standard debian package / rpm etc do, 
allows you to compile it with optimizations for your processor - and 
still has the sort of version control you'd expect as a safety net.

I can deny it, with a clear conscience.

probably the worst possible way to run a daemon, I'd say. xinetd is a 
bit better,

Call an inetd run program often enough and it starts limiting the number 
of conenctions possible to it - and if it doesn't do so, it is 
vulnerable to a trivial attack where you call it multiple times, and it 
forks multiple copies to make your system crawl.

More efficient is the standard unix tcp daemon mode - running 
continuously in the background (like sendmail -bd) rather than waking up 
when called and forking a copy of the program like [x]inetd does.

If you want a far better alternative to [x]inetd there's ucspi-tcp and 
daemontools (which might be familiar from a qmail install, but which has 
the sort of license that will prevent it from being bundled with debian 
except as "non free")

Not debian policy - but the installations are so completely different 
that a standard source install will hopelessly break things.

Not so in slackware or freebsd.

ok - you do that on a system that you have to get up and running, and 
then install / configure critical software on.  if you have enough time 
to learn it, and then to work your way around a maze of configuration 
files that are completely different from the standard files in a tarball 
install, then fine.

a tarball is simply a tar.gz / tar.bz2 of something - in this case, 
source code direct from the software author's site, rather than packaged 
by someone (say the maintainer of that package for the debian project)

that will ultimately come to bite you whether you run a mailserver for

I dont mean home users, though they shouldn't shrink from doing 
something that is quite often as simple as ./configure, make, make 
install ... I mean server admins, who should know to install something 
and then to tune / tweak it to meet their needs.

True, but then again you could just as well rebuild your Debian source
packages.  Its fairly easy to do for each individual package.  Agreed,
you can't do 'make world' or some equivalent to build everything in
one go.  *bsd and gentoo are good for that.

I also am not sure if compiling for i386 vs. i686 really makes that
much of a difference?  I'd like to see some numerical evidence and not
subjective views.  I am not talking of libraries like ATLAS, which are
hand tuned for specific architectures.  In this case Debian does have
arch specific packages.

Besides, if anyone talks of absolute speed, gcc, kde and gnome in the
same breath they are practicing some form of double standards. ;-)

I'll ask again.  How fast is "fast"?  What significant difference does
it make to compile it for your architecture?  Numbers please.  What
are your benchmarks?  How does it make any difference to someone who
does not use GNOME/KDE?

Besides the whole thread has digressed.  Being a fairly long time
user, I aware of some of Debian's shortcomings.  My only point was it
is unfair to wrongly characterize users based on what distro they use!

Not all software is as simple as "./configure, make...".  Satisfying
build dependencies can be a nightmare.  I once had to admin an SGI box
that did not even have a compiler installed.  I had to go as far back as
compiling gcc (and yes, I tried freeware.sgi.com already).  Don't think
I have any happy memories from that!

I'm happy that I can chuck in a debian cd (on an x86, alpha, sun, indy
or mac) and in 20 minutes have all my favourite software going with
little effort.

Even if I satisfy all my build deps, I still have to know all the
configure/build options.  The question is - can I build sendmail better
than the debian package managers?  Probably not.  If I spend a whole lot
of time reading the build instructions, then "maybe".

Am I satisfied with the quality/performance/features/bloat of debian
packages?  Yes.  And so are several others (including sys admins).  Is
it worth my time/effort to out-do debian?  No.  So what's the point?

This is a regular topic on most debian lists.  Somebody even got the
auto builder working and started compiling the entire debian archive
with 686 optimizations.

Its silly to have your entire system optimized for your CPU.  How much
faster is a 686 optimized version of cp/ls?  Consider the logistics
involved here - additional load on package mirrors, distributing bug
fixes, etc and ask yourself if its worth the effort.

IMO, Debian has made a good decision by choosing compatibility over
performance.

This is digressing, but someone wanted benchmarks so I'll mention my
past adventures with CPU optimization.  Some years ago, I compiled gzip
with optimizations and tried to benchmark it.  I had to compress several
GB of data daily and would benefit from a fast gzip binary.

I used these gzip binaries for testing on a P3 and an AMD k7 -
  o default debian gzip compiled for vanilla i386
  o default redhat/mandrake binaries optimized for 686
  o rolled several gzip binaries from src with various optimization
    flags (used gcc 2.95)

Fair trials were conducted with -
  o a 100MB file created from /dev/zero
  o a 100MB file created from /dev/random

The disappointing result was that all gzip binaries clocked similar
run times.  CPU optimization was not worth the effort in this case.
However, the biggest benefit was when I created an unoptimized static
gzip binary, which was ~30% faster than everything else.

Go figure!

A better way to go on such boxes would be to install a compiler from the 
SGI OS CD (not their freeware site), or to build binaries on another SGI 
box and rsync them over.

Even less on slackware :)

Actually, yes you can, for all intents and purposes.

A stripped down sendmail?  A sendmail with only TLS but no LDAP? etc etc

It depends a lot on just what you want to do with the package. Or if you 
want features that are only available in a later version of that package 
(as is the case with actively developed packages).  Updates to a version 
of (say) mutt will only backport security fixes, not features.

  Gentoo is all about *user's* choice.  A decision is
not always a perfect decision (atleast for someone). 
For me Gentoo (compiled for `pentium4`) has
significant speed improvements over slackware
(compiled for i486).  That's a proof.

Subject: [Ilugc] ISPs offering `unlimited` packages
Message-ID: <20040529152549.22757.qmail@web10905.mail.yahoo.com>

I am looking for ISPs offering unlimited hrs packages.
 I came to know ...

1. kmronine.com - Rs. 250 per month (what abt speed?)
2. sancharnet   - Rs. 6000 for 6 months (app.)

anyother ISPs?

Then which ISP has good speed over all? (Touchtel's
dialup connection has downloades of over 6KB/s but
available only for their customers)

What do u feel over Sancharnet vs VSNL?

VSNL == Tata Indicom == DDSL? I can't believe.

I haven't had a major problem with any of the packages I've built and
installed under Debian.  That said, I probably haven't tried
over-writing an existing deb.  But if one were to subvert the package
management tool, one gets one deserves.  If one uses the debian
package then things ought to work.  I am not sure what exact packages
you specifically are talking about.  I have 40 odd packages that work
fine (and some of them are non-trivial builds).  If its an issue of
one or two packages needing some shoehorning I don't believe that is a
problem either, since you are afterall willing to install things by
hand.  Where is the problem?  

In any case forget it, you don't necessarily have to explain your
opinion.  All I am saying is there are lots of folks who swear by
Debian and like the distro, please respect their choice.

I have been eyeing gentoo for a while.  I will try it when I get the
time and chance.  The point is, I thought you'd like to share your
opinion on why you said it was fast with some real numbers.  Many
reviews claim the same overall "feel" that the system is faster but no
one seems to provide hard numbers.

  I have not used debian extensively. So I have no
comments. The point is gentoo is faster than
slackware, so do than debian.

Hi All,
 
I wish to release my modified version of a GPL'ed program that I am using as an addon in my commerical app, but not my entire app. Here for an module i used GPL source code all other modules are developed by my own. The GPL modules is an addon module (It is not the part of base module). 
 
Being this the case i should disclose the whole source code or the Add on source code only.
 
If i donot release the source code am i voilating GPL license?

I'm assuming your commercial App isn't GPLed and that your module is a
library  against which  your  commercial app  is  linked. Assuming  my
assumptions are true, you are indeed violating GPL if you are planning
to link your non-GPLed app against a GPLed library. You either have to
GPL your commercial  APP[1] or find an alternative  module that is not
GPLed (preferably BSD or LGPLed).

Had this  library been  LGPLed and you  made modifications to  it, you
will still have the freedom  of releasing only the modified version of
the library alone (not the oftware that links against your library).

Also, looking at it from  the community perspective, The Free Software
Movement recommends  programmers to release their  libraries under GPL
and not LGPL.  The readline[2]  story is a pretty interesting thing to
read. But looking  at it from the bread and  butter perspective, its a
different thing altogether :)

Check clause 2.a of the GNU GPL. It answers your question. If you
butcher a GPLed program and make a library out of it., I dont think
you can release it under LGPL. You still would have to release it in
GPL. (I may be wrong here.) Coz, if you could.. that would end up as a
loophole in the GNU GPL which could be used by non-cooperating people.

However the whole thing applies ONLY IF you plan to distribute your
app to the public. For example., if the app is going to be used only
in your company, you dont have to be bothered. If you are going to
sell you app to either the public or any one else.. then the license
should be GPL.

However, I dont accept your hesitation. You wanted to use GPLed code
to your benefits.. but not give back your code in return. This is not
a healthy attitude (IMO). That is like being a parasite.. you suck the
benefits out and leave the community when it is no more of any use to
you.

Cheers,
Joe

It depends on the level of coupling between your app and your module.
If the module is a library that the app needs to compile and run, then
yes, you need to GPL the whole app. But if it is an "addon", as you say,
that can be dynamically loaded by your app at runtime, and the module
is *not* required for the base functionality of the app, then it is not
considered a derivative work. The relevant portion of the GPL is:

	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
	identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
	and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
	themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
	sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
	distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
	on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
	this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
	entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

So, if I've understood your scenario correctly, then NO, you don't need
to GPL your whole app.

hmmm... this  is what  confuses me.  Is this the  same reason  why the
Linux kernel simply  issues a warning while loading  a non-GPL module?
The kernel still  calls the functions in the module  isn't it? In this
case its  a reverse of the  kernel situation. The module  is GPLed but
the  one  that  "uses"  it  is  not.  so I  dont  know  how  well  the
"independant" clause fits here...

Maybe the original poster can ask fsf-friends[1]

Usually some  package or the other  depends on debconf  (the x server,
for  example). so if  you either  used dselect  or tasksel  during the
first time  boot and chose  one such package  you will be  asked these
questions.   Alternatively,  you   can  simply   select   debconf  for
installation from dselect.

Since 'dselect' is hard to use, I used to select only
'tasksel'. But there also it prompts lot of questions
for packages which I was not selected.

next time I'' try debconf from dselect.

Any easy way to use 'dselect'?

The easiest  way is to read  the dselect help screen  (press '?'). 

The second  easier way is to  declare a night your  sivarathri, sit at
around 07:00PM  and start the  installation. You will be  at dselect's
menu by  07:20ish. and you will be  done with going through  it all by
around  01:00 in the  night.  By  around 02:00  you would  have gained
enough knowledge about dselect ;)

If you feel that way, then Microsoft Windows installation should be more 
handy than RedHat.

I personaly love installing Debian.

Windows installations are fairly cute looking - but for eye candy I'll 
take mandrake, or better still MacOS X

If I want functionality then slackware or *bsd

Hi,
I am currently working on an application that receives a HTTP request,processes it and sends back the response. Part of the processing involves validation of the user and to see if the user is running a particular process (whose name is hard coded as of now). To see if the process is being run by the user, the application does a popen to the shell command (which involves doing a ps --User | cut ..|grep <process name>) and reads the response from the pipe. 
 
The problem that I am facing is that reading from the pipe works fine when the application is run as a standalone, but when we register it as a service with xinetd and execute it, the reading from the pipe fails. As an alternative, I tried using system() command for the above scenario. However, that too fails when the application is invoked via inetd. Please offer ur sugesstions to overcome this problem...This is VERY URGENT for my project completion. Please revert back at the earliest

The situations are not analogous. As you pointed out it is the reverse
of the kernel situation. The difference is quite simple:
The module is dependent on the app but the app is independent of the module.
So I don't see the problem, nor the need for confusion. IANAL, of course.

However, I dont accept your hesitation. You wanted to use GPLed code
to your benefits.. but not give back your code in return. This is not
a healthy attitude (IMO). That is like being a parasite.. you suck the
benefits out and leave the community when it is no more of any use to
you.
</snip>
 
I agree steeve, But the reallity is who are all in linux for commerical reason does this. Are you aware Redhat/Mandrake/suse(the list goes on and on) does this ....
 
In my view three caterogy of people support Linux/GPL
 
1. Researchers - Reason: They get it free of cost 
2. Students - Reason: They are seeing what is happening inside (An very good learning experience)
3. Commerial people - Reason: They make easy money (PARASITE)
 
What all the first two category of people do for this community will end up in the hand of so called PARASITE finally.
 
Anyway, I see this happening in what all work environment i've been in. Iam sure it will be the same in your work environment too.

Check clause 2.a of the GNU GPL. It answers your question. If you
butcher a GPLed program and make a library out of it., I dont think
you can release it under LGPL. You still would have to release it in
GPL. (I may be wrong here.) Coz, if you could.. that would end up as a
loophole in the GNU GPL which could be used by non-cooperating people.

However the whole thing applies ONLY IF you plan to distribute your
app to the public. For example., if the app is going to be used only
in your company, you dont have to be bothered. If you are going to
sell you app to either the public or any one else.. then the license
should be GPL.

However, I dont accept your hesitation. You wanted to use GPLed code
to your benefits.. but not give back your code in return. This is not
a healthy attitude (IMO). That is like being a parasite.. you suck the
benefits out and leave the community when it is no more of any use to
you.

Cheers,
Joe

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I agree steeve, But the reallity is&nbsp;who are&nbsp;all in linux for commerical reason does this. Are you aware Redhat/Mandrake/suse(the list goes on and on)&nbsp;does this&nbsp;....</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>In my view three caterogy of&nbsp;people support Linux/GPL</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. Researchers - Reason: They get it free of cost </DIV>
<DIV>2. Students - Reason: They are seeing what is happening inside (An&nbsp;very good&nbsp;learning experience)</DIV>
<DIV>3. Commerial people - Reason: They make easy money (PARASITE)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>What all the first two category of people do for this community will end up in the hand of so called PARASITE finally.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Anyway, I see this happening in what all work environment i've been in. Iam sure it will be the same in your work environment too. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&lt;snip&gt;</DIV>
<DIV>But looking&nbsp; at it from the bread and&nbsp; butter perspective, its a<BR>different thing altogether :) </DIV>
