Hi,

my 2 cents,

1) Start learning html,js,css and jquery.
2) learn ruby
3) Understand the concepts such as MVC, learn rails , there are dine and
dozen tutorials on the internet
4) learn the full cycle of developing  an app and deploying  the same.
5) Experience what TDD and BDD can really help for you.
6) Be expose to irc #rails and #rubyonrails channels, raise your questions
to ruby on rails forums
7) Listen to videos of ryan bates railscasts,peepcode etc.

so, if these things are done and when you feel confident , you can think of
contributing to any rails projects.
My rough estimate of learning period is( it depends with the personal
ability of the learner)

Industriously - 20 days to 3 month
religiously - 2 month to 6 month
casually - (mostly fails, about 1 to 2 years).


regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Eclipse is not just one application , its a combination of many
dependent applications .

http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/eclipse

^^ Keep digging the dependenices and it will result in a huge list .
Especially if you want a graphical application to run you would need a
hell lot of applications to run on the main kernel but you can
definitely build one for your own purpose .

If you are building for a specific hardware you can also reduce the
size of the final distribution . Maybe you want to build something
like a router software (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWrt  ) which
does very simple tasks and is based on linux kernel ?

I am also wondering why out of our 3000 members, only one person is
interested in having stalls for software freedom day.

This is one of our bigger events.

Please volunteer to have the event this year.

Thanks Pavithran,

Obviously i am building one with a GUI. Do you have any guide in building a
new distro like this. Say for example, let me install base debian system
and install all the required prerequisite and the my application. Let it be
a prototype and i want to build a iso with the same setup. Any user who
install with the same distro, has to be prompted with the my appliction.

Sorry, I could not do anything over the last few days.

What I have done now is, follow the steps given on
<http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=81942>.

By running lsusb with and without the data card, I determined that
"Bus 001 Device 004: ID 1c9e:9605 OMEGA TECHNOLOGY" is the device.

The above format of the device code brought up by lsusb seems to
indicate (according to the author) that my computer recognises the
device as a modem. So I skipped Step 2 and went to Step 3 as advised
by the author No go. So I went back to Step 2. Got the following with
two attempts. What next?

As always, your help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Tapas

Try this 

/sbin/modprobe usbserial vendor=0x1c9e product=0x9605

Let me know if that works. If it does, then you can add an entry in udev
rules to automate it.

~$ /sbin/modprobe usbserial vendor=01x1c9e product=0x9605

Demo is useful only when you understand what it is supposed to do and
what happens underneath.

A VPN is a concept that took me more than 3 years of real experience
to really understand.

A VPN is certainly a client server technology like HTTP or SMTP(web
browsing or email).

When we browse there is a server like rediff and our browser Google
Chrome or something is the client.

In VPN also it is the same idea.

When a client node of the VPN connects to a server node in a remote
network then the client server
 communication is established.

After that connection is established there is no client server idea
between the two connected networks.

So for instance your LAN is 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.80. The remote LAN
is 192.168.2.1 - 192.168.2. 80.

After the VPN is established you can ping the machines in both
networks across the Internet.

You can achieve this either by making your side the VPN client or your
side the VPN server.

Now the story does not stop here.

You can also establish multiple VPN connections and talk to multiple
LANs. This can be in server or
 client mode.

Reading between your words (unwritten), I think you mean VPS (Virtual
Private Server) and not VPN.
A VPS is essentially a small server running in a virtual machine in
the service provider's data center.
Some providers charge additional for CPanel management front end.
Otherwise,  you are on your own as for it's system administration,
maintenance and security.

If indeed you meant, VPN then please explain the connection between
VPN and CPanel.

This is a rhetorical question.   You need to ask that off of your client.

Who has installed the OS?  Do you have root/admin access to the VPS?
Is your client authorizing you to do the sysadmin or they want to keep
control of that?   If they want to keep control then they need to
either pay for a Cpanel UI *or* learn to administer the system via ssh
access.

Also -- Honor the list guideline and do *not* top post.

Subject: [Ilugc] javascript and vim editor
Message-ID: <CALDskyyRrK5zy7itgamuyY_ZijUZ=WmUvSVGxUsvsvW0CMxarw@mail.gmail.com>

There is no good way to format javascript source with vim.

If you type ggvG= then it will get confused.

Vim does not understand enough of javascript.

So this is what you do.

First fire up your package manager and install node.js.

It may be called just node, or server side javascript.

Then install this.

# npm install -g js-beautify

This is a node.js package for formatting javascript.

Then plonk this line in ~/.vimrc

nnoremap <leader>ff :%!js-beautify -j -q -B -f -<CR>


Now fire up vim and type

\ff

and your code will get nicely formatted.

Cool.

Message-ID: <CALDskyyTUMUotgbFWEfzYV7ZMTadDREmQ+1xLdV42QZBprasgA@mail.gmail.com>

Recently I had to do a project collaboration with bitbucket and I
setup a git repository with bitbucket.org for free.

You can easily create a project with homepage written in markdown
format. Readme.md.

Then you can checkin source code using git and you can push it
 to a repository that instantly reflects on the website.

You can also set the repo for public or private access.

Using this you can easily host an open source project.

I use sourceforge for my LiveUSB projects which are not getting me
 much interest these days. But I used to have some traction.

But those are not source code projects.

And most of the work I do involves appliances or OS based stuff.

For small projects involving source code that people can check out
 and build I am sure bitbucket.org is the way to go.

Dear LUG makkale,

I am in Chennai for 2 days, 10th and 11th of Sep.

I shall be glad to spend around 3 hours in the latter portion  of
 the day for a very short hands on training on the Vim editor.

I spoke to Madan of Sansel, Royappetah.

He is not sure. In case anyone can arrange it it will be cool.

We can have some fun.

So as it stands this affair is not confirmed. Without venue I
can't do anything.

But in case things work out then you are free to spread the word around.

I made a mistake in not thinking through beforehand.

Subject: [Ilugc] Airtel 4G dongle
Message-ID: <CAFum4PmAk44+E0xLEbmDJLanRtgbcBAx5hq2MO0cp5Nsgmbo9g@mail.gmail.com>

I got one yesterday - Huawei 3276. I think it has got activated as the
green light on the dongle keeps blinking.

Ubuntu NM showed new GSM broadband connection which I clicked and set
up the whole connection. After that the connection showed up in the
list but did not connect.

File manager showed the volume installed as airtel. Went in, looked up
Linux directory, copied it to tmp and ran the install script.
Installation went through without asking for overwrite - presume thus
the software was not installed earlier.

Reboot still did not get the connection up. Volume shows up in file
manager. Probably means mode switch has not been done automatically.
NM applet drop down list shows "registration denied" in status.

My questions:

a) Has any one gone through this procedure earlier with this modem? If
so, pointers will help.
b) Does not the NM install procedure automatically install the
drivers? Or do drivers come with 12.10?
c) Any thing else one should try apart from usbmodeswitch?

I think loading usbserial module for this particular product id and
vendor id combination might work.

lsusb will give you product id and vendor id.

sudo /sbin/modprobe usbserial vendor=id product=id

See whether Network Manager detects the modem after this.

Nope. Does not work. Dongle still shows up in file manager as a
volume. Unmounted it and then gave the usbserial command. Tried
bringing the connection up using NM. Same error "registration denied".

I would try the following:

1. Plug in the device
2. Check 'dmesg | tail', it should have usb-storage related entry.
3. Load the usbserial module using the command in the previous mail.
4. Check 'dmesg | tail', it should have usbserial related entry.
5. Run 'sudo wvdialconf' and see whether it detects a proper modem.

Friends.

In my recent experience, the responses for any call for volunteers is
higher in social media, than the replies in our list.

If this continues, we can not do any activities with these less responses
on the mailing list.

I am thinking of getting help from few volunteers to spread the
requests/call for volunteers/call for speakers in all the social media.

Thus, we can get more interested people and make our activities happening.
Else, we may end up with lesser and less activities.

Share your thoughts on this.

Please reply here, if you are interested in social media activities on
behalf of ILUGC. The tasks are simple. Spreading the news and calls on your
favourite social media.

Thanks.

Building a custom distro is not an easy task. There are several softwares
to package with each of its dependencies resolved and different
architectures to support. It requires a lot of manpower with experts in
many different areas. More than a freelancer can do.

What you can do is build a killer custom OS taylored to your PC, based on
gentoo or archlinux (or few others). Starting with archlinux is recomended,
as you don't have to compile each and every package(which can take
hours/days in total). But if the need arises you can comiple specific(or
all) packages for you PC architecture in archlinux.

I completely agree with Narendiran. It's really a big task. But someone can
use Ubuntu Customization Kit for it.

Building or tailoring kernel according to the specific needs using
archlinux is really a big mess.

Like installing debain net install, install the recommended packages and
using something like remastersys to create a new one.

You need to really define what you want to do and ask for people who
can execute the task. Your subject gives a completely different idea
than what this email says.
Kernel experts would be people who understand intricacies of Linux
kernel and how to create modules, modify and tweak the kernel. That
has little to do with distro customisation, which includes a very good
understanding and upto date knowledge of the particular distribution.
Though kernel developers will likely be very good at this too but it
may not be exactly their area of interest or the problem they want to
solve.

For a tamil wiktionary [ http://ta.wiktionary.org] project, we need to
delete multiple patterns from a text file.

currently, we are using gedit and using find/replace with space for the
each pattern.

See the task here.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF2KLhxFq9w

Is there any gedit plugin to "find and replace multiple strings" or any
command line tool to do this?

Hope we can do with some regular expression and sed/awk utilities.

Can anyone try them and share the snippet?

Thanks.

Hi,
    I could not learn more about the Team behind this initiative ,
 Whomsoever is trying to do it they are missing on many grounds . one of
the main question to them would be is this a business or charity they are
trying to do ?

technology is the easy part there are many other pieces to this puzzle
which i may be of help , would like to have a business talk with the
founders to better understand what they want to achieve ?

I see some familiar lines with Rajagopal's post on another thread
(consortium of solution providers).

Great initiative.   Are these training sessions free or fee based?

What is the motivation factor for people who are interested in giving training?

Subject: [Ilugc] javascript and JSON
Message-ID: <CALDskyxt6aGcZ+Bef=wWi3hKrDWRp1HDSMhWETVbd9EVZTkDOw@mail.gmail.com>

JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation.

It is a protocol between server and client or between any two entities.

You can either give it on the command line or store in a file in that
 format or of course exchange over the wire.

It is a text based protocol with no endian issues.

It is not language specific. But in its name we find Javascript which is a
 language.

We find JSON implementations in perl, python, C and of course javascript.

JSON helps us send and receive data with remote machines outside of the
 domain/server from which we got the web page. In other words JSON
 allows you to send and receive data with more flexibility than CGI which
 helps us communicate with dynamic data using either GET or POST name
 value pairs in the forward direction and some proprietary format in the
 return direction.

JSON allows us to send and receive data in the protocol.

With node.js and other server side javascript you can also have JSON
 in command line or configuration files.

Javascript usually does not interact with client filesystems.

But in a server environment with node.js we can have a lot of power.

Node.js also comes with plenty of packages using a package manager
 called npm(node package manager) and you have many readymade
 tools for doing server side weight lifting.

Great meeting everyone at today's Meeting!

Thanks to Vysakh for a terrific live demo/presentation about writing a gem!
His vim-fu is amazing; would love to see him do a talk about how he uses
vim & tmux for rails development.

There was a small concern at the back of my mind that I would end up with a
sense of wasted time & money with this one day trip to Chennai for this
meetup (+ meeting personal friends after a long time). But the meet-up was
awesome, and left me with a sense of accomplishment & satisfaction; met and
made quite a few new friends, and had excellent response & discussions
during my talk!

Here is the slides for my talk today:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3554509/indiaruby/chennairb.html#

Looking forward to a very active Ruby User Group in Chennai going forward!

Zero confirmed form fill so far.

Is it means that no body wants to run the software freedom day event?

Atleast please reply here why nobody is interested in this event.

Without running these kind of events, we can not be active.

Yes. Volunteer should pick a free software and have to demo it to the
visitors.
If we have some 10-20 demo stalls with various software, any visitor can
get the
total view on what GNU/Linux can do and capable of.

Magento. Will fill the form - you decide if it will be helpful.

This means, your hard disk is full.

run the df -h command in terminal and check if / or /home is 100% used.

If so, delete the unwanted files and give some free space.

My guess and limited experience tells me that the most likely culprit
is the local caching of software update files (*deb). The packages we
get with apt-get or software manager are archived in
/var/cache/apt/archives. So, any new installation / updates files will
be stored locally.

sudo apt-get clean
>> Clears downloaded .deb files stored as cache in /var/cache/apt

I use Bleachbit to do clean-up the unwanted files on a regular basis.
In my case, some icon sets was also taking lot of space, so deleted
some unused sets.
If you want to go the Terminal way
http://askubuntu.com/questions/36111/whats-a-command-line-way-to-find-large-files-directories-to-remove-and-free-up

If you are a kde users, you can use Filelight (KDE App) to graphically
view the directory sizes.

There are plenty of options. Unix tools excel at this sort of thing. Some options:

1. Open the file in vim and then type:

:%s/<search pattern>/<replace pattern>/g

2. Run the command:

perl -pi -e 's/<search pattern>/<replace pattern>/g'

3. Run the command:

sed -i -e 's/<search pattern>/<replace pattern>/g'

You might notice that, all these approaches follow almost the same syntax, 
that's because it is a almost standard regular expression search-and-replace 
syntax. This form of seach-and-replace is *very* flexible, allowing you to 
search for multiple strings and replacing them or for allowing the replacement 
string to contain part of the matched searched string ...etc. If you could 
provide a more concrete example of search and replacement strings, we could 
possibly help you better (although, since I do not know tamil, that might 
possibly limit the extent to which I could help).

cheers,

We need multiple strings replace in a text file.

Example.

Line one - 1
Line two - 2
Line three -3

Replace all 1,2,3 and - with space.

How to do this in a single command?

sed -e 's/[123-]/ /g'  <your_file_name>

remove the 'g' at the end if you want to replace only the first
instance (in the line).

Dear Shrini,

Design a small poster about the SFD '2013 event in CEG and publish it in
ilugc site.  I will post the details in our list as it reaches more than
400+ colleges and we can expect more volunteers/participants for the event.

sed is a good choice for replacing text in files, as I am using it in
Fedora kickstart files for modifying many of the system configuration files
after post installation.

Good to see such tips , it would be nice if they are collected and put
up in the Ilugc webpage or wiki ?
Something like a newbie guide to scripting ?

Yes, that would be helpful. I can forward it to a few groups that am part
of. What we need to reach out to is specifically the non-IT crowd -
businesses that are not aware of these technologies, and might welcome if
they knew more.

Shrini: Do we have a poster designer that I can work with to get this done?

Though I am not an expert designer but I can try and would love to help. I
am familiar with Inkscape and can use it to make any Template for Poster.
Do let me know if you're interested and also drop me the details for the
same.

Hi, I never used the 4G dongle. But with Huawei 3G dongle, which comes
with Linux binary module, is working with my 32bit machine. It is Not
working with 64bit machine (even after installing lib32 ...). I tried to
duplicate the udev rules in 64bit machine with usbserial. But no luck. May
be you can try in this angle..

Hi All,

http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/support-0-a-d-an-open-source-strategy-game

Your opportunity to contribute to open-source game development. Please
dont $ rate scare you off in participating. ;-)

Excerpt...

In short, 0 A.D. is a free, open-source, cross-platform, real-time
strategy game of ancient warfare.

To break it down (and get rid of a lot of hyphens!), the game is
similar to the classic games in theAge of Empires series and is
completely free to download and play.

0 A.D. is not only completely gratis, but its codebase is freely
available under the GPL and its art and music are licensed under CC
BY-SA. It's free to distribute and mod. This means there is no DRM.
And, above all, 0 A.D. sets an important precedent for software
freedom in computer games. More on that later.

Hi

How do I echo the current command which I typed in bash ?  I know that our
current command goes and sit's in the value of "$0"  However when I try
putting this inside .bashrc it does not give me correct results.

$ fc -ln 0 gives what I typed in previously not the current command.

For example:

$ ls
The current cmd you typed is: ls
. .. Pictures Document
$ clear
The current cmd you typed is: clear
$ who
The current cmd you typed is: who
bla bla bla .......

I don't think so that there is any such way to get this. BTW you can alter
the 'history' command according to your need (that's another way around).
If there is any way to do this then I am eager to execute that.

If you're trying to update the title of the xterm, you can use a DEBUG trap:

trap 'echo "$BASH_COMMAND"' DEBUG

Not the same as you expect.
But it gives the command name executed.

Answers from the Tenth Planet team for our queries.

1) The training is free for the participants - IT Jobseekers and
students. Our programmes are conducted only for unemployed graduates
and college students mostly from rural background.

2) The Mentors can volunteer and take part in these programmes and
contribute their time and share the knowledge to the jobseekers
community. There is no pay. We can take care of the food and local
travel arrangements. If we get any sponsors for the programmes then we
can pay the mentors accordingly.

3) Tenth Planet Open Source Foundation is a social enterprise which is
working towards reducing unemployment in the IT segment. For the past
5 years we have been conducting many free training programmes to
freshers on Foundation skills, Methodology skills, Product skills,
Business skills, Health & Wealth.
http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-downtown/committed-to-tackling-unemployment/article2097529.ece

We nurture young talents and support SMEs and NGOs using Open Source.

We are working towards connecting the jobseekers with the Industry
professionals and Employers through our programmes.

Hi Shrini,

We need to create a group and page in Facebook and this helps to promote

Thanks.

We have a page already.
https://www.facebook.com/pages/ILUGC/133359730009404

Do we need a separate group in facebook?

If we have such a group, we will get more interactions there.
But, it will kill this mailing list.

I have seen so many communities moved to facebook followed up by the died
mailing list.

There are many tech facebook groups, where many discussions and activities
are happening.
You can share ilugc details in them.

The sad part is lot of our silent members are very active facebook groups.

Fine.


Thanks for volunteering.

Will mail you for personally for the ilugc fb page admin details.

Without revealing the programming language of your back end, your
query is open ended.   I am sure most of the popular web programming
languages have libraries to do the same.    Also, the network settings
are distro dependent.   You will have to account for that too.

> Say like network module in webmin.

You can study the code that does network settings for webmin and
modify it to suit your application.

May be if you can create a twitter and google plus account its even easier
for people to share.

No It wont, infact its possible that the member count will increase.

My suggestion is that every time you post any community activity if you
post a social media link to it,
may it be specific or a general ilugc link to twitter or google plus. Its
easy for people to share with smart phone.

Here I am asking you a specific question, are you planning for "Software
Freedom Day"?
Then you should try meetup.com, flyers other medias which are also
effective.
let me know your opinion about these ideas.

For all Ilugc members please watch this interesting TED Talk
http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement.html.

Krishna

Antarctica are participating this year in the contest, which is
organised by Wikimedia Chapters in the respective countries and
various Wikimedia groups.

Started in 2010 in the Netherlands, WLM has attained lasting
popularity. In 2011, 18 European countries joined the Netherlands and
created a collection of nearly 170,000 photographs, achieving the
Guinness record. Thirty five countries participated in 2012 in the
contest, which received more than 350,000 photos overtaking its own
record from the previous year.

Participate
To enter Wiki Loves Monuments, participants upload their entries to
the Wikimedia Commons under a Creative Commons license. The Wikimedia
Commons is a media repository that serves Wikipedia and its sister
projects. Like Wikipedia, it is free and open to all. Learn more about
participating in Wiki Loves Monuments.

WLM in India

India has more than 7,000 historical sites spread across its 28 states
and seven union territories. In India, where WLM is in its second
year, it is supported by the Wikimedia India Chapter, a non-profit
organisation. Last year, WLM received more than 15,000 photos of
Indian monuments, most of which were those of the Taj Mahal. Over
2,000 people participated from India, which made India rank the
highest in the contest in terms of the number of participants. A few
winning photos from India went on to be a part of the international
WLM contest. Pranav Singh from Delhi won the first prize in the
international contest. Narender Kumar, also from Delhi, ranked sixth.

Awards

The main for the international contest is a trip to Wikimania, the
annual international conference of the Wikimedia movement. Every
country awards a few prizes nationally as WLM is a federated contest.
The highest prize in India is Rs 25,000. Read more about Indian prizes
here, and the International ones here.

            !$ is a bash variable that expands to "last
term/string/word in the previous command". When you did "ls -l
network-*", !$ would point to network-* - The last term of the
command. When you did "date", it is single-word command. So, !$ would
point to that.

When you do

$ !$

You are asking bash to execute the last term of the previous command.
It would work for date because there is an executable with such a name
in your $PATH. It wouldn't work for network-* because that is not an
executable. Thanks

In addition to the list Srini has shared, I'm not sure If we can also
demonstrate some GPL or Community based applications which can be used in
Office like

** OpenOffice
** Project Management (phpProject)
** CRM
** Resource management for Conference Room Booking System
** Document Management Systems (openKM)
** Learning Systems (Moodle)

Message-ID: <CAM2YbnMqw-4ADfW4KPWNGfAuwoNJkoDRboezp19df27GUKwQvw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone , I m dinesh .
As a part of my UG project I ve built a computer game , which i would like
to showcase in the coming ILUGC meet .  This computer game features a new
way of interacting with a computer game . a short description of the
project is below .

*Abstract*

1)The player will be playing the game with his natural language .
The natural language statements are given through his voice(from
microphone).

2)The player can communicate to the characters(bots) inside the game.The
characters will communicate back and forth .

3)The player can have control over not only the character(role) he is
playing , but also other characters in the game .
Eg , If the game is a rescue mission performed with a team, the player can
communicate to all the team members .

4)No prior knowledge such as remembering key-controls are required here .

Note:
Please don't confuse this game with ?speech recognition games? , we are not
doing raw ?speech recognition?,
we are employing natural language processing techniques to play the game .

Thank you .

Have you formatted it?
have you mounted it?

What procedure you used to create the partition?

Please give more details for obtaining more specific help.

You seem to be running fsck as normal user. You should be root or if
you have sudo permission use it.

It seems that /dev/sda1 is already mounted. Check permission to the
mount point. You can post output of
1.mount
2. ls -l  of the parent directory where /dev/sda1 is mounted.

Then try Linux Mint (it's good and user-friendly and supports all above
requirements).

Boot the system with ubuntu or any other live cd.
open terminal.

run the following command.

sudo fdisk -l | grep Linux


you will get a few Linux partitions.

Then, run the following command

sudo fsck -y /dev/sdaX

replace X with the proper device number.

SysAdmin 101 - learn to read the log files --

The log files in /var/log directory is the first place you should look
when daemon (services) do not work.   Usually, the log files give
enough information with respect to the problem it encounters.    You
need to remove those problems one by one.

Pretty much any distro supports all of the above.  The specific apps
would depend on whether you choose KDE / GNOME / XFCE / LXDE or other
desktop environment (DE)

Can you please elaborate on the above?   Is the default interface a
problem or something else?

Without specifics issues that you have with Ubuntu, it is kind of hard
to suggest something else.    The KDE / GNOME / XFCE or other DE in
any Linux distro is more or pretty much the same.

+1 for Linux Mint. I would recommend Mint 13 KDE which is LTS (Long
time support) release, so is supported for sometime.

Regarding your printer - search http://home.windstream.net/joelwest/
here with your printer name and filter results by Ubuntu / Mint if you
face any issues in connecting.

For handling file shares through GUI install "system-config-samba".

In todays meeting, we had a good discussion about the manging ilugc
activities and getting more people for volunteers.

People suggested that creating a facebook group for ilugc.
We may get more volunteers and participants for the events, if we goto
facebook.

Want to hear about this idea from you all.

Please share your thoughts.

+1 for the idea.

Obviously, more online presence helps and will help in having
meaningful and liberal conversations w/o mailing list etiquettes like
worrying about top-posting. ;-) I sometimes see that even when a noob
posts a genuine question we are pedantic and first suggest top-posting
instead of solution. Agreed, there are guidelines but top-posting is
not a heinous crime and we should care about the OP's problem than
worrying about such trivial issues. People would slowly learn pick the
right way of communicating in mailing lists. Am pure desktop user and
have slowly learnt the jargons and forum rules and now see the benefit
of guidelines but for a noob it could be discouraging. We should rate
content over its form. Anyways, i am digressing.

However we need to be careful about spams, trolls etc and needs to be
moderated heavily. This will help in organizing better for events,
share pictures, videos, etc than just plain text content. We have
luxury of better bandwidth these days. :-)

Also, G+ is a good tool as i see many technies hanging out there.

The devils advocate speaking:
1. What is a unit of conversation on facebook/g+/other tools that you have
in mind? Can it be archived and searched conveniently?
2. How do you plan to move the existing conversations from the list to the
new tool
3. When there are no volunteers here, how do you expect to have more
volunteers in facebook?

I think what we need is a presence on facebook, and someone taking up to
updating it regularly, to garner more eyeballs and potential volunteers to
join the mother list. IMHO, social networks have not replaced mailing lists
yet. Far from providing migrating tools.

Madan

Not to throw spanner in the works but we constantly hear horror stories like

http://socialfixer.com/blog/2013/09/12/beware-your-business-is-at-the-mercy-of-facebook-social-fixer-page-deleted-without-explanation/

also would it be in the spirit of freedom and openness to depend on a
commercial 3rd party like facebook for our daily activities ?

IIRC, Open Source for You also has a large Facebook following.    If
not already done, then you may want to cross post ILUG-C activities
there as well to get wider publicity.

Personally, I agree with all of Madan's points.    There need to be
more volunteers who are willing to answer the questions and/or give
directions; this comes from "within" all of us - the concept of giving
back to the community.  Here I have observed only a few doing this.

I am sure that quite a few of the yester-month's rank newbies have
graduated to a higher level in their Linux skill set and we need those
individuals to come forward and start helping the "new" rank newbies.

Dear all,

I think many of you are aware of M.Sc-FOSS degree program from Anna
University.

I am one of the student and now I am in the final semester (project sem).

My IT background is full of Linux administration and not a programmer. But
in this semester I need to do a project in any open source technology. I
have planned to do a project related to Openstack and Cloud computing, but
I have no specific idea of project
(don't know what to do).

Please guide me on this from where to start, Any project ideas etc.,

I have done X forwarding many times in the past and it worked just fine
with the command shown below.

ssh -X server "gnome-open /home/bala/Documents/Link.ods"

However I am not too sure what happened that now a days, I don't seem to
get the text when x forwarding is done.  Have a look at the PNG if my
explanation is not clear.

Analyzing twitter data is the easiest thing you can do using hadoop. It

The following are my personal views.

1. Many ILUGC members have fear on posting to mailing list. They have told
many times to me in person. They may have to learn many guidelines. They
feel that facebook has no guidelines.

2. They are already in lot of facebook groups and they are contributing a
lot.
Tons of questions/answers, news sharing, event sharing/contributing
happening there.

3. It is very tough to see the low contributions from the people
contributing the mailing list, for any of the "Call for X". Call for
speakers, Call for SFD demo stalls etc.

4. We need more events, more participants, more volunteers which the list
lacks.

5. What if we have a facebook group and via it we get more
questions/answers/interactions/events/participation/volunteers as it seems
very easy for many potential people. There are chances for good things to
happen. Why not to explore.

6. Yes. The mailing list may slowly become inactive. Still it will be a
choice of people to ask question in mailing list or facebook group.

7. I am too not a fan of facebook groups.
see my thoughts about them here.
https://goinggnu.wordpress.com/2011/04/15/bid-adieu-to-facebook-technical-groups/

8. Yes. Facebook discussions can not be searched/archived.

In the age of internet, the support we give is very less, while most of the
content is available on various forums/blogs/stackoverflow etc. Do we need
archiving? How are we using ilugc mail archives?

IRC is being used by many technical groups. Do we have all the IRC talks
archived? Still we can reach them in IRC and get answered or give answers.

9. We need more physical volunteers than the online contributors to conduct
local events and meetings. With the current active mailing list strength,
we can not conduct much events.

Ex: only 3 SFD stall submission till two days ago. Once I shared them in
other facebook groups, we got 12 now.

If we have more volunteers, we can have separate teams for managing
meetings, events, website,
workshops etc.

Hope we can give a try with new facebook group.

Community should be for people and by the people.
To get more events and activities, we need more people.
Let us reach them via one another medium.

If this experiment fails, no harm.
Still we will be having the mailing list running.

typical projects like these which are time bound and dependent on
understanding of your professors and guides . what is the time frame we are
talking about here ?

what skills do you already have ?  to take the plunge in the sense of
understanding the landscape quickly first and then aligning oneself to be
able to fulfill your project requirements as well as contribute back to the
project .

start with
http://devstack.org/
 , i am sure with your admin background you should be able to sail through
the first step of setting it up

start looking around https://ask.openstack.org for asking questions and
answering them or solving them if you can .

join the developers mailing list http://www.openstack.org/community/  ,
there are two channels on Freenode IRC you should be hanging on
#openstack,#openstack-101

write a blog post what you are looking for share it with people you feel
comfortable with in the Openstack community as guide.

you should be starting now and should be comfortable with  in a week with
the above activities in order to get to the real work ahead of you .

ask more here if you do not understand any of this .

Message-ID: <CACtiFJbchLB7beaVRiZYyEE5r=yAM0R77tgJTFDFtzUe_vtNXA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

My sincere apologies for posting the FDP/Workshop Event Report mails in
ILUG-C in the recent times.

As I came to know through Mr.Shrinivasan, the members of the ILUG-C
community were against the term 'on behalf of ILUG-C' used in my posts.

As you all are aware that I have been a longtime member of this community
actively promoting FOSS in academics since 2003.  Apart from any commercial
activities, I spend much of my time in promoting FOSS in colleges through
FDP/Workshops.

Our list has more than 3000 members as of now and we have more members from
academic who is also watching this list.  These members contact me directly
requesting for Workshop/FDPs to conduct in their colleges (instead of
posting them to list). Nearly 80% of my programs which I have done so far
in colleges are also unpaid and I don't take any advantage of promoting my
business activity through my programs (all colleges knows this truth very
well).

I am more involved in bringing the knowledge sharing culture through FOSS
within the academic community.  I do (and mainly) promote the community
activities in all my programs and thought nothing wrong in using the term
'on
behalf of ILUG-C' in my post.

As I understand that many of the members sees my posting as a commercial
activitiy promoting my company instead of a community activity.

Once again my sincere apology for my all posts made in ILUG-C (related to
FDP/Workshop events) and I would keep continue posting them in my own group
'linuxpert' in Freelists for those who wish to know/read them.  They are
archived at

http://www.freelists.org/archive/linuxpert/

Who are they ? what  contention's  do they have to your actions, the
commercial and non commercial is long lost argument , tell me when we are
talking about sustainable development in every walk of life when you try to
get some mileage out of the name and kind of work you do , i would rather
applaud rather than frown upon.

we as kids are taught to mistrust than to trust someone's actions , unless
there are serious vilolations with proof of specific incidents againts you
i do not think you are causing any harm to the so called ILUC-C community.

Would like to hear from everyone on this list what is your take on this
case ?

i would encourage this even if it is done , the only thing to watch for is
keeping  it transparent in terms of money , share whatever you get with the
volunteers who turn up to help you . You build a community who believe in
your vision and then soon you will not need any support from ILUG-C too :-)

Did you see the OpenStack contact[1] page? I strongly feel that, it is
the right place.

Before starting to do a project in OpenStack, you need to understand
what OpenStack is. I would start here [2].

There are several components in OpenStack. May be you should concentrate
on your strengths and choose the right one. 

Since you said you have only system administration experience, you
should quickly learn Python programming language [3]. This will be very
useful.

Do your home work before asking. Explain your strengths and ask how you
can help them.

I think these days most of the newbies know how to google and they find

My view - I'd probably not go to FB for such lists. FB is far more
casual and free for all. I opine it will not work well for such a
group. I think FB cannot be moderated either. FB is definitely a great
place to attract youngsters.

We must use FB collaboratively with our mailing list and not replace
one with another.

Technically, we are all encourage to evangelize/train, but not 'mandated'.
 The events are not discussed in the list and "decided upon".

Though I used to mention about ILUGC and mention the nearby FOSS groups in
my talks, it was "on behalf of NRCFOSS / AU-KBC/CDAC", as the case may be.
Now that I am not officially engaged -- but still associated in their FOSS
activities -- I have to be cautious while using the term.

Personally speaking, I would like to see "on behalf of ILUG-C" -- may be,
like FOSS development communities, we can have a core group -- members
 "accepted" on the basis of meritocracy & contribution. Should definitely
include the Coordinator (T. Shrinivasan, at present) and a few others.
Kenneth would have teased me that Raman and Bharathi would have been my
choices, and he would have been right.

Continue your efforts and all the best.

Dear Baskar

I am sad to see this. But then, your contribution is independent of any
acknowledgement
it receives from ilugc.

Whether on behalf of or in spite of, please continue the good work.

Probably it is a good idea for ilugc to decide what it stands for and
articulate the do's and dont's.

Most mailing lists discourage use of the list for promoting or
marketing products to the list members and I do agree with them. The
most prominent reasons being:
a. Reducing spam.
b. Objective of the list being sharing information and not to sell products.

If I had seen LinExpert's notice in another list, I probably would
have posted it here as it benefits and most importantly promotes FOSS.
Will I be asked to stop this? If not, just the fact that Baskar is
also a member is incidental.

FOSS needs a lot of promotion from many quarters to be adopted.
Conducting FOSS in colleges has a good cascading effect in promoting
FOSS. If ILUGC had resources, it would have certainly done this. In
the absence of such resources, some one else doing this as a
commercial enterprise must be supported.

If some folks have the problem with "on behalf of ILUGC" tagline,
maybe they could suggest an alternative tagline. I think it will be in
order that Baskar's efforts are endorsed in some form by ILUGC.

            Very sad to see this. Personally, I would prefer to see
your mails on ilugc. It helps in letting a larger audience know that
more colleges are moving towards FOSS. What's confusing me is, you are
actually promoting ilugc by adding that tagline and so why should
anyone object to this ?

            Sometimes, we should stop going by the book and look at
what we stand for. We, as a group that encourages and promotes the use
of free software in all walks of computing, should be supportive of
people and organisations that promote this very cause. Baskar has been
doing exactly that for so many years on practically a showstring
budget. And, after doing the event on his own, at his own expense he
has been kind enough to add the ilugc banner to the events. Let's be
practical and thank him for all the good he has done. Thanks

            I don't know what's there to fear. When we make mistakes,
people tell so - in plain words and we correct ourselves. That's part
of the learning. And how is having no guidelines good ? Is having no
law at all good ? I don't think so. What we can do is, make the
guidelines newbie friendnly. But no guidelines at all is bad.

         The concept of lugs started when Internet was not this wide,
there were far less users of GNU/Linux and documentation, if any, was
quite bad. So, people needed the help of others who had been in that
situation to guide them. But that time has passed. Most GNU/Linux
distros work on a wide range of hardware, the installation is
straight-forward and they are quite user friendly.

 In general, lugs aren't the same as generic "user" forums, where
people expect to be spoon-fed. Historically, you go to a "lug" with a
question when you are in a situation where you have tried everything
you know, done your (re)search on the web and you are still stuck.
ilugc too has been this kind of list.

What we can do is, make it newbie friendly. We can help newbies both
with the problem they are facing and with the guidelines.

          Yes, we do need archiving.. The content available on forums
etc. is available because they decided to archive. Archiving
contributes to the existing knowledge base, irrespective of how less
the support we give is. For eg., the other day Noorul Islam helped
another member with the usb dongle(or something similar). Now that it
is archived, it will benefit everyone.

        We can ask those who volunteered newly to join ilugc :)


I personally do not prefer going the facebook way. We should look at
ways to improve the list and make it newbie friendly. Of course, it is
just my opinion. Thanks

We can discuss this ad infinitum.   The newbie expectation (from my
perspective) is that senior/experienced users must bend / bow to them,
hold their hands and spoon feed them.

You go through the archives and you will find people posing questions
and then disappearing when more information is sought from them.   A
few have been "fearless" and their knowledge base has blossomed, if
this is their "fear" then IMO they should stick with whatever OS they
are comfortable with.   They are switching to Linux for their *own*
benefit, the FOSS community has it's own culture and they need to
embrace and adopt it.   They are not doing FOSS any favor by switching
to Linux/*BSD.   IMO, this is no different than relocating to a
different part of the world, learning the local language, eating local
food and adopting the local culture.

I see a few issues interlinked.

New participants in Free and Open Source Software are in a way getting
drawn into specialized niches. As an explanation, there are enough
programming language specific groups/sub-groups where a new
participant finds interesting issues to dive into or, ask.

Facebook/G+ are gradually making a move to be the "one single page"
for any user. By which I mean that irrespective of the hardware
platform being used (desktop, mobile), the social networks tend to be
the firehose of information (and, sometimes of discussion)

Requiring to learn guidelines to undertake an activity should not be
the cause for fear. A lot of activities that one does eg, driving a
car, operating a machinery, buying/selling goods/products, creating
software applications/services need the operator to be aware of
guidelines and instructions. At some point I fear that "the mailing
list guidelines are too rigid" is a very easy throwaway excuse. Having
being around long enough to have seen (and, be the recipient of)
various mailing list guidelines hammers, I can safely say that the
user group lists are far more welcome and tolerant. In fact, they go
out of their way to help an individual learn how to clearly articulate
their issues. It is indeed the case that English may not be the
language we are most proficient in, however, it is the language that
is most used when communicating on various platforms. To be able to
acquire skills to communicate virtually is not something that is a
cheap skill of no obvious use.

Having said all of the above, I would request that you consider
different platforms like Askbot for example, instead of having the
content locked into a FB/G+ group. There will be some content
generated and, having forums where a structured Q&A is possible
ensures that the new participants can also feel encouraged to become
regular contributors.

Thanks for all the comments.


Though we create facebook group, the mailing list will remain as it is.

We lack physical volunteers for any of the activities.
Please check the archives on the replies for any "Call for X".

To make more interactions with people and to get more
volunteers/participants/visibility,
created a facebook group.

https://www.facebook.com/groups/149125865297604/

Join there if you are interested.

         Unless every post in facebook is
posted(automatically/however) to this list, this is a very bad and
disappointing decision. People who are only on the list *might be* put
to disadvantage.

         It is not a question of interest - We are all here because we
are interested. It is a question on what facebook would do with the
data. It is enough trouble having to worry about what gmail will do
with my data(for people like me who use gmail). Hope you understand.

Message-ID: <CAND2794W+SC98D0zBfj-3wSawYsdyAWiV8VimCeNL--cwZz_Uw@mail.gmail.com>

Ubuntu is growing by the community. Ubuntu runs many events to get
more volunteers and contributions.

Global Jam is one of the events where anyone can provide their
contributions, along with lot of people around the globe.

We had the event in Sep 13,14,and 15 2013.

Ubuntu-IN LoCo team had the event online at #ubuntu-in IRC channel at
irc.freenode.net

We can do any of the following during these days.

Development
Packaging
Testing
Documentation
Artwork
Triaging Bugs
Reporting Bugs
Translation

I picked up on packaging and documentation.

I learnt python packaging.
Installed python-stdeb

http://shallowsky.com/blog/programming/python-debian-packages-w-stdeb.html

This tutorial explains how can we package the python software.

Packaged the software "qrcode"
https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode

It provided nice installable deb files.

Next step is to create PPA in launchpad.

http://shallowsky.com/blog/programming/packaging-launchpad-ppas.html

This link explains this.

My PPA is accepted, but still,I had some troubles in sending my deb
files to PPA.
Exploring more about this.

Wanted to contribute for Kubuntu Documentation.
Found the existing tasks here.
https://trello.com/kubuntu
https://trello.com/b/4zyxwgRP/kubuntu-docs-saucy-salamander

Can not work on this much as the existing doc itself looks very fine.

Read the existing doc for any spell errors. everything looks fine.

We had our Local Linux Users group's monthly meeting.
Presented about "Ubuntu Global Jam".
Explained how anyone can contribute for ubuntu in various ways.

Explored Launchpad's bug process.

http://www.slideshare.net/tshrinivasan/contribute-toubuntu

Wrote an article in Tamil about Launchpad bug process for Kaniyam.com,
an online E-Magazine for Free Open Source Software in Tamil.

Will organize a event locally to do these kind of Jam for
contributing, next time.

Thanks for the Ubuntu team for such events.

Creating something new will be a nice project.

Dont afraid to write programs, even though you are a sysadmin.

Hope you have tought programming also in M.Sc FOSS.

I have a requirement for wikipedia commons using openphoto.
Requirements are here.

I dont mean that people dont like your posts.

They just wanted the posts to come without the string "on bahalf of
ilugc" as none of the ilugc members know how you contact the colleges
and organize the events.

You can directly say as "on bahalf of linuxpert.in" too. No harm in this.

Please keep sending these mails as they show the activities happening
in tamilnadu colleges.

Thanks.

Let us later decide which tagline to use, 'on behalf of ILUG-C', or 'on
behalf of LinuXpert Systems'.

I wish that, our community members understand that I am doing my activities
in the true spirit of FOSS *as a member of this community* not as a *CEO of
my company* promoting my business.

Ok. I Will continue to post without any tags in future.

Earlier, this list received few requests for conducting guest lecture /
workshop on FOSS in their respective colleges.  As no one has responded or
followed up, later they contacted me for the same to conduct in their
colleges.

hi all,
the Anna Univ M.Sc. CS-FOSS curriculum, syllabus and other details are
available at : http://cde.annauniv.edu/MSCFOSS/

it may give you an overall idea of what the students are being taught (and
expected to know). Since many of the students are working in some IT area,
their knowledge levels will vary -- work experience might have increased
their knowledge while some might have concentrated less on the subjects due
to work pressure !

during my lectures (for 1st sem students) I advise them to start
interaction with some FOSS group, preferably LUG/GLUG.  I think a
reasonable number of them have joined or already members of some FOSS group
or other.

For the next batch (the admission is open) beginning in Oct 2013, I will
try giving "your experience in working with your nearby LUG" as an
assignment for the unit 2 of "Philosophy and Practice of FOSS".

We generally advise the students to start thinking about the project
options when they finish second semester. However, putting this into
practice is a different matter. There is also the reality : most of the
"students" have full time jobs tagged with personal & family
responsibilities. While this is not an excuse, I request those who have
specific project suggestions to  keep this in mind.

I am also hoping to interact with the "donor" group so that the current
batch could be helped out and some road map could be set for the
forthcoming batches. Suggestions/interactions could be thru my gmail id :
srini.it at gmail.com

thanks and best wishes

There is nothing harm in saying "on behalf of ILUG-C". Baskar Selvaraj is a
long time member. He does his contributions and promotions to FOSS in his
own way. He can be benefited financially. but thats okay.

This is a contradicting statement. I guess every time he does any
activities, he should have mentioned ILUG-C and LinuXpert systems. so he is
promoting ILUG-C in the colleges. isn't it good?

so if i am owner of a company and i am also member, and i wanted to conduct
a event. shouldnt i say "on behalf of ILUG-C"?  If it is not, then are we
proprietory? is ILUGC copyrighted?

it is like saying "Indians" are wining in cricket matches. so should we say
we are not wining. it is bcci cricket members are wining?

my suggestion to Baskar sir, you can and should and have all the freedom to
say "on behalf of ILUG-C".

If some members dont want to hear, shouldnt it be decided by the community?
may be take a vote. lets not define rules and regulations just to do define
it.

agree. PDF printing is not same across platforms. unable to setup printer
drivers easily. Tamil unicode texts are not visible properly in ubuntu.

anything and everything i need, i have to do lot of hacks and
configurations to get it working. i also need to read lots of mailing lists
/ forums / documentations.

Message-ID: <1200438792.310179.1379393684743.JavaMail.root@mail.kgisl.org>



I want to make several points on this topic: 





1. The Free in FOSS stands for Freedom or Sudhandhiram; not Free as in Gratis or Ilavasam. As long as any of the 3000 members of this list post their thoughts, and those postings are related to Freedom providing software; I or nobody should have any objection. I argued this point with the late Kenneth Gonsalvez; and he suggested to put a "Commercial" tag; which in my opinion is redundant and nonsensical. 




2. The Linux kernel is jointly developed by entities such as RedHat, IBM etc. all of which are commercial public companies, that exist to provide gains to shareholders. The employees from the companies routinely post on the Linux Kernel mailing list. They do not add [Commercial] tag to each and every post. I don't see why our Linux User Group mailing list should be any different. 




3. The fact that Baskar is a long-time member of this list is not relevant to this discussion; the fact that he is talking about Freedom providing software is the only relevant point. 




4 All postings in this list should serve a purpose to be relevant; sending reports of workshops 10 times a month, serves no useful purpose in my opinion. Rather, it can be posted that a workshop was conducted on so and so topic; and so and so were the agenda and activities therein. If somebody can conduct workshop on some relevant topics; they can post their capability even if they do or do not conduct workshops. Provided that this is done on occasion; this need not be construed as advertising. Evangelism is also advertising, and advertising skills on Freedom Software; even at a price; should be acceptable and encouraged on this list. The thread on a Facebook page for this list is also to advertise the existence of this list and its members; so advertising FOSS capabilities on this list is not evil. 




5. If required, we can insist on "Ad" tag for such threads; and have a policy restricting the number of Ad posts to say 5 or 10 per month. In my opinion the Ad tag is not required; but if some people strongly feel; it can be insisted. There is no shame on posting Ads; in fact; only because of the postings I came to know of some people and their skills.

Dear members,


> how about taking this action item in the next meet?.

Not necessary.  I wish to stay away from all these noices because of my
regular posts in this list.

As I was really worried about our education system going behind proprietary
software, I took my very own initiative of promoting the value of FREE
software in academics and will be doing that so for my lifetime.

As my recent posts have produced a lot of noices within the community about
my activities including me, I wish to stay away from this list for sometime.

Any activities done by me (either for myself / my company / community /
colleges benefit), I would rather post them in my own group were there are
more than 1000+ members (mostly from academics) which I have built over
years, whom I focus and also who understand me well and about my
initiatives and keep supporting us all the time.

Sorry for all the disturbances happened due to me.  Let us stop this thread
here.  I will keep contributing to the community in my own way I think.

Thanks for everyone who have supported me over the years.  I will remain
silent in this list, but won't be posting anything.

--------------- 


Is it the objective of ilugc mailing list to prevent members from talking about Commercial activities on the list? Nobody is answering this simple question; Free Software means Freedom not Free of Cost. 

Talking about commercial activities related to Free Software is not a crime on this list. Why is this so hard to understand? 




Is there a single among the 3000 members in this list not interested in earning money to support their livelihood? Even Richard Stallman receives money from the McArthur Foundation to support his other activities. 




So many many many people think it is a crime to talk about activities around Free Software that involve monetary gains - this is silly.

Iff the company has given permission to the employee to use his/her 
official e-mail address, can he/she use the same. Otherwise, a 
different account needs to be used. Whether the individual is authorized to speak for the organization or 
not doesn't matter. Any e-mail sent through the official e-mail 


address can be used against the employee. 

--------------------------- 


The employees of IBM and RedHat are not secretly working on the Linux kernel; they are working in official capacity only. Likewise on this list, many members are working on FOSS products and services; sometimes gratis, sometimes charging money. Nobody needs to feel guilty for charging money for offering products and services based on FOSS.

This is a volunteer-driven list, and people try to help each other out
of their own interest.

The problem is when commercial entities try to take advantage of the
group for their own selfish needs, without appreciating the principles
and values of the group. Just because it works elsewhere doesn't mean
it should work everywhere. There have been cases where groups, and
conferences (in India) have been "hijacked" for personal or commercial
interests.

But, this list is quite considerate to allow people to post with a
'Commercial' tag. Otherwise, it wouldn't have survived this long.

Agreed. But, in a community, people are respected for their voluntary
work, and nothing else. So, how one balances the number of voluntary
and commercial posts is crucial, just as maintaining the
signal-to-noise ratio.

I have not seen anybody hijacking this list for personal interests which are not based around Free Software. If anybody tries to do that on this list, we can simply ban them. But banning any post on a FOSS activity such as workshop; just because it is commercial does not make sense to me. 

> But, this list is quite considerate to allow people to post with a 'Commercial' tag. Otherwise, it wouldn't have survived this long.... So, how one balances the number of voluntary and commercial posts is crucial, just as maintaining the signal-to-noise ratio. 

Very true. Which is why I suggested a "FOSS-AD" tag, and limiting such tagged posts to 5 per month. 





Totally banning such FOSS-related posts entirely is not a good idea, IMHO.

Dear all

Probably I would have posted maximum 'on behalf of  ILUGC' in the list
for the last 10 years. My humble opinion

1.Let us use 'on behalf of ILUGC' only if any ONE of the following is satisfied

a.If the offer for the event came to ILUGC either on the list or to
the co-ordinator/members and someone attends the event.

b.If we talk about ILUGC in the event or had banner/any other material
promoting ILUGC.

In all other events it better to post to the list without 'on behalf ILUGC'.

I have been following above guidelines and refrain from postings
events where I could not talk about ILUGC.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] The goals and objectives behind FOSS FDP / Workshop
	conducted in Colleges
Message-ID: <CACtiFJbuiwdN8pwHWiAcRE+Has=Z7PvWM60tTue13vsTEgkLuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I mark this mail as [OT], as I do not wish to see another long thread on
this
topic.

Continue reading....

I personally felt that, most of the list members were not able to understand
about these FOSS FDP / Workshops conducted by us in colleges. This mail
would shed some lights to them what actually these programs are and why
they are conducted for.

Anna University introduced 'Open Source Lab' in the regular curriculum in
the
2008 regulation and nearly 250+ engineering colleges started adapting them
since 2011 (these colleges were affiliated with Anna University of
Technology,
Chennai / Thirunelveli by that time).  Next academic year all 550+
engineering
colleges affiliated to Anna University will be handling this subject.

In 2011, few colleges approached us for conducting Workshops / FDP for this
subject, so that they could handle the subject easily.

Usually FDPs are conducted by colleges by getting any sponsor/grant from
University or from any Technical Societies like CSI/IEEE/IET/ISTE etc and
conduct the program in their banner.

As the colleges could not get any sponsor/grant from University (the reason
given by a college Principal is, the sponsor/grant is applicable for any
subject, if and only, there is both Theory/Lab component for the subject is
available).  So colleges could not get any sponsor for conducting FDP for
'open source lab'.

Hence I decided to do FDP for these colleges FREE of COST under certain T&C.

The college who is willing to host the FDP should be calling all the nearby
colleges, so that many colleges could benefit from the FDP.  If the hosting
college wishes, they can charge a minimum expenses from the participants,
but
that should not include the training cost (if the amount charged is high,
then
we could not get enough participants).  Colleges agreed for this T&C and we
took
all responsibilities of contacting colleges and getting more participants
for
the FDP.  Our initiative started reaching other institutions and some of the
reputed institutions came forward for hosting the FDP under the T&C set by
us.

How do LinuXpert Systems benefit from these FREE FDP programs ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As our FDP programs are usually focused on training only the Faculty
members, few colleges show interest in doing these similar programs to
their students. The workshop conducted for students are usually paid by the
college management.  The more the FDP we do FREE of COST, more the
workshops we get and we keep reaching out hundreds of colleges year by year.

Though the monetary benefits we get from these programs are very small, we
feel much satisfied with the service we offer to our college customers.

In my recent observation, I have noticed that most colleges (or departments)
have some sort of policy on implementing Linux/FOSS in their
colleges/departments.

I had to maintain a close relationship with the academic community to bring
a
change that I wish to see.  That's why I spend much of my time with colleges
doing workshop / FDPs and also trying to build a strong vibrant community
that
we all wish to see.

Myself and the academic community are working together towards achieving a
common goal for bringing out a change in our education system,

This seems to be right solution. But there are always e-mail filters.
May be the OPs should help others to filter such mails easily.

== Date & Time

21 September
3:00pm to 5:00pm

== Venue

== Agenda

Talk 1: Setting up your Python Environment
by Prasanna Venkadesh
Duration: 45min

Getting started with a language like Python is bullet-fast, but
picking up the Standard practices on the way requires time and
effort. This talk will explain about setting the environment before
getting started with a Python / Django project using VirtualEnv,
VirtualEnvwrapper, Pip / easy_install, Fabrics. Following such
practices would make the development easier.

Talk 2: Python Byte Code Hacking
by Vijay Kumar
Duration: 45min

The Python interpreter converts Python programs into byte codes and
executes them. In this talk we will understand what these byte codes
mean, how to disassemble them and how to modify them to do some really
cool stuff. We will work our way up with small examples and at the end
of the talk we will have our own working implementation of this recipe
-- http://code.activestate.com/**recipes/576944-the-goto-**decorator/<http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576944-the-goto-decorator/>

If you would like to give a lightning talk, just come prepared, we
will be able to accommodate you.

If you are new to Python, the tutorial at
http://learnxinyminutes.com/**docs/python/<http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/>will
give you a quick
overview of what Python is all about.

Vijay

      Why do you think this is needed ? What does an "implicit" no
objection certificate mean ? What if people object to someone doing it
individually ? (may be out of jealousy, nothing valid). What if the
poerson is requested to present something short notice ? Do you think
we should not  talk about/on behalf of ilugc even to genuinely
interested people. That's unfair.

Instead of doing our best to promote free software, and appreciating
people who earnestly do that, we are talking about totally unnecessary
rules here. At least Raman's points look quite reasonable, but I
personally do not agree with these as a necessity.  Thanks

I am new to the list but personally I feel that there using the "On behalf
of ILUGC" name for conducting free events and workshops should be allowed
or rather encouraged. Imparting knowledge for free resonates with the core
principles of the FOSS community.

The contentious part seems to be when the group's name is used for
promoting commercial events whose aim is to make money. A simple compromise
would be to allow sharing of information about commercial workshops but
making it clear that these events are conducted in purely individual
capacity and are not representative of the group. Just my 2 cents.

Thanks,
GR

what else sign green sheets and get a police clearance , i do not know
what world we are living in or where is it going . this whole thread i see
now is leading nowhere .

the biggest strength we have is we are disorganized and are living in
virtual space . we can say and do what we want . we can move fast and meet
physically in the analog world when required . This whole fifedom will kill
this and lead to destruction of this community/space .

Such thoughts in the context of what Baskar is doing boil down to
being regimental and bordering on the ludicrous.

I think we have lost complete sight of the spirit and the symbiotic
relationship ILUGC can have with companies like Baskar's in furthering
the cause of FOSS. No wonder Baskar feels he is better off without
involving ILUGC.

This does not bode well for us as a group. We are not a formal group
(formal groups will have a structure, representatation vide elected
office bearers etc) to give clearances nor do we have any one vested
with that authority in this group.

Hi

>>I think we have lost complete sight of the spirit and the symbiotic
relationship ILUGC can have with companies like Baskar's in furthering
the cause of FOSS.

The following information was told to me by Railway Baskar (The railway
Baskar, not the linuxpert baskar)
Railway Baskar and Linux expert company  did a workshop at Eswari Engg
College.
At later point of time, Railway Baskar was approached by the college to
conduct a workshop and railway baskar took Raman to the college,
this was objected by Linexpert Baskar because of his business Interest.
(Raman and Railway Baskar please vouch for the authenticity of this
information).The problem here i see is which hat does linux expert baskar
wears, a volunteer of ilugc or a CEO.

>>No wonder Baskar feels he is better off without involving ILUGC.
We  welcome it. He is entitled to have his own opinion.


Do we need a clearance to conduct an event, I think the co-ordinator should
take a call,
My opinion is , it is better to have one.

------------ 


My opinion is; "On Behalf Of" is a meaningless term. There is no need for any clearance since this meaningless term "On Behalf Of" can be removed. Without that meaningless term; anybody can post anything related to FOSS on this list. ILUGC members do not have any authority to clear or reject any FOSS related event by any member.

Sorry for your misunderstanding.  But that was not a workshop, but a
complete three months commercial training program conducted for the
students of MCA requested by the college management.  And Mr. Baskar agreed

I have always given due credit for our ILUG-C members for their
contribution in all the workshops organized in colleges.  Kindly read
through the last part of the interview.

http://www.linuxforu.com/2011/09/baskar-selvaraj-interview-foss-power-in-170-tamil-college-labs/

Myself and Railway Baskar have jointly done many programs for the colleges
in the years between 2008 and 2010.  I have introduced many of our ILUG-C
members to colleges during the workshop organized by LinuXpert Systems and
they all have represented themselves as ILUG-C members and not as
representatives of LinuXpert Systems.

By the way, I also requested members to intimate me, if they get any
enquiries from the same institutions, so that I would know about the event,
but they did not.  On some occasions when I was not reachable by colleges,
the colleges have contacted the resource persons directly who were
introduced by me and they approached the colleges independently and started
doing programs. Nothing wrong here and I didn't make objections here
because of business interest.

My only question to them was, when they have been contacted directly by the
colleges, atleast they would have left a message to me, when the same
college again have requested for a workshop, so that I would have joined
with them.  But their thought was totally different, why to intimate me
when they have been called directly.

Would like to hear from Mr.Thiagarajan on this.

Hi,

>>Sorry for your misunderstanding.  But that was not a workshop, but a
complete three months commercial training program conducted for the
students of MCA requested by the college management.  And Mr. Baskar agreed
for doing the training on commercial basis, ILUG-C or community activity
did not involve here.

I was further told by Railway Baskar that you insisted  for one such
commercial exercise you
asked Mr.Railway Baskar to put the event report as "On behalf of ilugc"
which he flatly refused.
Need Mr.Railway  Baskar to  confirm this message.

This may sound very trivial and non sense to many as a issue.

The silver lining between (a) ilugc event or in association event  and (b)
your companies activity is not known/visible.

We request you to mention "on behalf of ilugc" to those event which is
promoting foss inspirit of equal opportunity instead of you be operate on
our behalf  and you decide who is member to the party and who is not.

Message-ID: <CAPV1RAAsMDNuecVESwRbLXRBSp=Crp=YFdYm3h8-18A7fjviKA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

We are trying to map mycompany.com/newdb to amazon elastic IP(static IP)
hosting a webserver on port 80.
Unfortunately the mycompany.com is hosted on IIS.  They have simply made a
redirect of this subfolder(newdb) point to the elastic IP. So I start
borwsing with  "mycompany.com/newdb" URL and it gets redirected to
"xx.xx.xx.xx/newdb" but now in the address bar I still see the elastic IP.
My objective was to hide the IP address but show only the name "
mycompany.com/newdb" even after the redirect.
How can this be achieved. is this a feature lacking in IIS  and Apache
better at these kind of works ?

Regards,
Krishna

Have you contacted AWS technical support?  I think they would be able to
help you better since they know the internal workings of their service.

Friends.

Let us stop this discussion here.

Hope baskar will continue sending mails on this list on all his FOSS
related activities.

If the event is organized via ILUGC, he can put the word "on bahalf of ILUGC".
else, he can omit the string.

Please stop here.

It  should be easier to rewrite the URL in IIS to newdb.mycompany.com.

Now in the DNS zone file of your domain registrar, you can create an A
record for newdb.mycompany.com pointing to the elastic IP.

For some, In some cases -- depending on student interest -- have given
intro to nearby community groups/members like Abhas, Shakthi, etc. Of
course, they have the "freedom" to follow up or not.

Some have attended the events like Software Freedom Day, Gnuunify, etc.
Carte Blanche still happens.

Since most of them are working persons  I don't want to push them much.

I mean post the announcement to the list and go ahead.
Generally nobody is going to object to FOSS activities.
But suppose somebody wants to MsDos training then people may object.
The rules can be formulated easily.

ILUGC can still have a set of functional rules about admissible activities.

This discussion by itself suggests a set of rules.

How do you say magento is slow - did you do any benchmarks? Is there any
specific need for you that makes you think will not perform well on Magento?

Dear All,

We thought of coming up a good story on the distro release time span. 
Our question is 'With many distros going for a six-monthly release 
cycle, do you think the release cycles of distros are too short? (And 
users don't have to upgrade on a frequent basis?) '

What do you think on this? Would really appreciate if you share your 
views elaborately.

Priyanka

While other distributions will have a documented rationale behind the
release cycle, here's what The Fedora Project states "The Fedora
Project releases a new version of Fedora approximately every 6 months
and provides updated packages (maintenance) to these releases for
approximately 13 months. This allows users to "skip a release" while
still being able to always have a system that is still receiving
updates." (from:
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Release_Life_Cycle>)

Further on, in the same link

"Fedora generally develops new releases over a six month period to
provide a regular and predictable release schedule. The bi-annual
targeted release dates are May Day (May 1st) and Halloween (October
31) making them easy to remember and avoiding significant holiday
breaks. Changes to this standard must be approved by the
community-elected Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (FESCo).

A six month release schedule also follows the precedence of Red Hat
Linux (precursor to Fedora). Former Red Hat software engineer Havoc
Pennington offers a historical perspective here
(<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.redhat.fedora.advisory-board/1475/>).
GNOME started following a time based release based on the ideas and
success of Red Hat Linux and other distributions following Fedora
having adopted a similar release cycle. Several other major
components, including the Linux kernel, Openoffice.org, Xorg, have
started following a time based release schedule. While the exact
release schedules vary between these components and other upstream
projects, the interactions between these components and Fedora makes a
six month time based release schedule a good balance."

To: Wikimedia developers <wikitech-l at lists.wikimedia.org>


The current round of Google Summer of Code & FLOSS Outreach Program
for Women is about to end, and it's time to start a new cycle of
mentored projects in Wikimedia tech.

Check and contribute to

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Mentorship_programs/Possible_projects

if you are

* a Wikimedia project awaiting a specific software feature

* an organization with budget for tech activities looking for a short term goal

* a tech contributor with a cool idea for Wikimedia projects or
MediaWiki in general


Even if software development is a prominent activity, we also
encourage proposals focusing on other technical areas: quality
assurance, design, sysadmin, promotion...

Post your proposal soon, edit it often. By submitting a proposal to
the Possible Projects page you get attention and help from the tech
community in the form of reality checks and contacts with possible
mentors, interested projects and funding sources. 21 projects were
selected in our last round, finishing now:

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code_2013
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Outreach_Program_for_Women

We keep searching for more opportunities to channels these projects,
both within the Wikimedia movement (Individual Engagement Grants,
chapters...) and out there (internship programs encouraging free
software and diversity in tech).

We want to hear your feedback! Use the discussion page or reply here.

This apparently has nothing to do with FOSS; it appears to be a proprietary product. We should not be talking about or promoting such products on this list.

No more 'whose behalf'.  If anyone in the list interested in doing the
seminar, they can either contact the college directly, else if they
contact me offlist, I would forward their request to the college and inform
them to make any necessary arrangements (travel/hospitality) for the
resource person.

If I do the program in my own capacity, I would simply put the tag [Event
Report] and post it in the list, without mentioning about 'on behalf of'.

------------------- 

That is not the question I asked - about how you are going to post, after the seminar. For this particular workshop, you asked for others to contact you off-list, without mentioning whether this particular workshop is being planned on behalf of ilugc or your company. Like Thyagarajan said, your emails are not clear about your intentions. 

So my question again: "Is this particular seminar conducted on behalf of ilugc or your company?"

As the requested topic cannot be handled by me or by my company, I have
forwarded it to the list.  If anyone does, it will be 'on behalf of ILUG-C'
only.

The original email (which includes the forward) uses the phrase "we
want to conduct a seminar" and, is signed off by a faculty member. Is
it difficult to assume that the email was forwarded to ask if someone
would be interested in conducting the seminar at the institution?

As a solution provider, I recommend CentOS/RHEL, Debian Stable / Ubuntu LTS
for business environment.   For one of a kind driver support, a custom
kernel built with imported config of the distros default kernel.

At a personal level, users can choose what they want.  The frequent cycle
may be good for those who work with bleeding edge hardware and need driver
support for the latest stuff.   For desktops, I have a hybrid model -
Debian stable + latest LTS kernel.

+1.  IMO, all members have the freedom to conduct workshops and ask for
volunteer help in this list towards that effort.

When I read the OP, I did not perceive any commercial angle.

I don't wish to have, or put a separate banner for any of the future
seminar / workshop / FDP conducted by me or by LinuXpert Systems (but they
will be done in Association with Institutions / Community).

All I need is, I need a name when approaching colleges, that's all.  In
future I don't wish to see mails, unnecessarily asking whether I am going
to do the program in ILUG-C banner or in my company banner.

As long as I am connected with the FOSS community, all my
activities/efforts would be for the benefit of the user community.  Unless
members understands this, this specific issue will never come to an end.

The problem arises when we start assuming things. The original email is addressed to Mr. Baskar in his Linuxpert Systems mailing list; not the ilugc mailing list. So when Baskar asks for help, one would normally assume he wants help to conduct on behalf of LinuxPert Systems only, not this list. There is nothing wrong in doing this, but clarity was missing. 

Now, in Baskar's reply he says " ...cannot be handled by me or by my company,...If anyone does, it will be 'on behalf of ILUG-C' only." 

-------- 

See? Our assumption was wrong. Why this restriction for anybody else to conduct only on behalf of ilugc? On what basis is Baskar placing this restriction on others in this list?

I don't understand what you mean restriction.

I received two mails from the same college from different departments
(CSE/IT).  I have forwarded both the mails to the list.  Now it is left to
the members option.  If no one responds to the mail within specific time,
then I have to make alternate arrangements for the request.    In the first
case, if nobody come forward, then I can do the program myself.  The later
case, were myself or my company does not have required resources, I have
requested the help from list.  If anyone from the list do so, then it would
be 'on behalf of ILUG-C'.

Hope things are clear now.

I think I am going to call this one out.

[1] The faculty member wrote to Baskar on his email address. I
couldn't figure how it can be construed as "his Linuxpert Systems
mailing list"

[2] It is somewhat reasonable to formulate a hypothesis that Baskar's
email is widely available because (a) he has been conducting these
events and, (b) perhaps it is search engine friendly

I actually believe that Baskar's response "on behalf ..." is
redundant. Person A writes to Person B, Person A writes to a wider
forum and asks an interested individual to respond to him. Till this
step, there is no indication that Person A desires to make a
commercial enterprise out of it (even if Person A has a commercial
business catering to a similar domain). It is often seen in daily life
that people asking "let me know and, I'll introduce you to them".

If you do have a specific question about the instance, it would
perhaps been better to take it off list and receive assurances.

---------- 

So Baskar has forwarded an email from his company mailing list to ilugc mailing list; because he cannot service the request. Fair enough. But he is placing a restriction that others should contact him off-list; and can conduct only on behalf of ilugc, whatever that means. 

Who has given the right to Baskar to decide how others on this list should do workshops?

When people over here shiut towards newbies for not following rules , why
not they first follow them before advising?

3. Do not troll in the mailing list

4. Use [OT] for off-topic, non-technical discussions. But, don?t misuse
this to start flame wars or to troll in the mailing list.

Friends.

I dont know what we are going to achieve here.

Most of us have our own communities as twitter followers,facebook
friends, blog followers, etc.
some have our own mailing list.

When someone requests for any workshops,we usually ask in our communities.
And will try to link both the trainer and the institute.

This is what baskar tried here.

We asked him as "ilugc is not getting the contacts of the colleges".
Hence he just forwarded the request from college as it is.

Now, if anyone wanted to conduct the workshop, they can contact the
college directly or via baskar.
Thats all his mail means.

Any training center or corporate trainer can also contact them and
conduct training in any banner.
It is the trainer's wish.

If possible, find a trainer and help to conduct the seminar.

We need to conduct more seminars and workshops. Then only we can build
the student community to use Free Software.

Please stop the discussion here.

Newbies never expect answerers to bend or bow. All they expect is Answer /
Solution to their Questions / Problems.
Infact, if your answer satisfies their needs, they will repesct their
seniors more.

Yes. It happens.
But, people ask questions here just because they are not aware. All those
who ask Questions are not experts in Computer. (Some may be new to computer
itself). They may not be able to answer you completely.

In case you need more information for attempting to resolve the issue, you
may provide them with a guideline on how to get that EXTRA information.

For instance, when you go to a mechanic shop for repairing your car / bike,
you just tell him / her about the problem in your own language... Or as if
what you know.
And he will never ask you back details of technical specifications. Rather
he will ask you and get answers from you in yiur own understanding.
Is this applicable only for them?

None in the world had switched to anything for the benefit of humanity nor
benefit of world. Infact, even researchers switch things to experiment and
find whether that is beneficial.

Do you mean that everyone who switches over to Linux must do something to
FOSS ?
If that is the case, should those who did not contribute switch back to
Nasty windows? Again then, what is the aim of FOSS and where is it heading?

Final Question...
Suppose some enthusiastic homemaker switches over to Linux, do you expect
him / her to learn Software Engineering to solve the problems? What type of
contribution do you expect?

P.S: In case this mailing list is meant only for Software professionals /
Linux career enthusiastics,  I request you to kindly intimate me the same
and, unsubscribe me from this list.

Sorry from me too.

@Members:

I decided to continue in this list only because of the request / advice of
the senior members of this list. But things are getting worse here than it
was before.

I feel better to be off this list and work with my own community which I
have built and continue my activities there.

I will be unsubscribing myself from the list when you read this message, so
don't expect any reply from me for this thread (hope some members would
feel happy about this announcement).

I am actually with Arun here and probably his reply was misunderstood
in many ways causing this email. One thing needs to be noted here.
This list is not a free or paid technical support forum. Almost
everyone who has been in the list for some time is an enthusiast. They
try to help others with their own experience and knowledge out of
their own interest and generosity, not with the intent to gain respect
or something in that direction. The only thing we insist on this list
is to do prior homework before asking questions or for help on this
list. Even when the OP doesn't do that, almost always someone asks the
right questions to get more information to be able to help. What the
newbie posters should realize is that they should enough groundwork
and follow-up and not expect people on this list to give spoon-feeding
solution. There is no obligation to give the answers and whoever tries
to help cannot be blamed here. The newbies tend to just look for the
answers to their questions and send everything else to /dev/null which
imho is a very bad thing causing a lot of such problems.

The main theme behind mailing list guidelines is to help the people on
the list to be able to help the posters with their questions and
problems. They are merely to maximize the chance of getting a solution
to the question and at the same time not to irritate thousands of
subscribers by sending emails in SMS lingo or repeatedly turning deaf
ears to follow the guidelines. In mailing lists, the conversations are
archived and there is absolutely no need to top post and quote all the
emails in a thread with every reply. It is also considered a waste of
bandwidth by a lot of people. Interleaved, trimmed posting is easier
for conversations and for this reason we recommend it heavily on this
list.

I feel very sad that there are way too many meta discussions on this
list these days for a variety of reasons that lead to nothing
constructive.

And for your query on this list being restricted to software
professionals and enthusiasts, my answer is that it is open to
everyone who is interested in free software in one way or the other.
Even as a Mechanical engineer you are welcome to be on this list and
participate. A shining example in this direction is the late KG who
was a lawyer by profession but was a free software enthusiast who
participated actively in a lot of FOSS communities and contributed in
many ways.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Frankly, its hardly inspiring to be part of this list and
unsubscribe_from_this_list  is a thought that oft crosses my mind when
I see these unwarranted debates. Off late, I really have not seen much
of quality discussions except trolling and unsolicited advice,
half-baked code, unaddressed noob questions. Except for daily command
tips and some forwards of announcements, there are not worthwhile
discussions which one feels like *starring*.

If we need to make a difference to FOSS ecosystem, we need to generate
and elicit content that will benefit the community.

What I would love to see is FOSS application / distro reviews, sharing
info on projects, initiative updates, quality discussions and debates
on next-gen technology discussions.

Hi All,

I have been using Mint for past few months and am really enjoying the
Mint vibrant community.

I am thinking if it is a good idea for some of us to get together and
start "Mint India community" and perhaps get it listed under
http://www.linuxmint.com/communities.php

Please share your views.

As per Mint site, the community can serve in the following ways. Of
course, it is not limited to these activities and we can come up with
other ways of promoting Mint.
______________________________________________

Local Communities

Local communities are independent groups of Linux Mint users. They
promote the distribution and they benefit from a very close
relationship with Linux Mint.

The role of a local community is to:

Provide a place for users to gather, to support each others and to
interact in their language
Translate the User Guide
Translate the ISO images
Organize localized or local events
Promote Linux Mint locally

Message-ID: <CANc+2y4VE+jUn0LBSeYaxTmjiJPf4UZ87qOyd=AgQSapTxy1dw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am using vim with ctags. I have some C source files in a folder
which is already indexed with ctags. I have set vim to call ctags
whenever a file is saved in that folder. The tags file is big (21 lakh
lines) as I have indexed header files also. So whenever a ctags is
called it takes time to modify the tags file.

To solve this I need to have two tags file (in same folder) with vim.
One tags file will have index of system supplied header files (it is
static and will not change), the other tags file should have index of
C code being developed currently (not static and changes). Is there
anyway for vim to recognise both the tags file from same folder?

Thanks and Regards,
PrasannaKumar Muralidharan

Dear Fellow Luggies; I can sense many people will feel I am the reason for Baskar unsubscribing from this list. So far in this thread I asked a direct question and got vague replies. Now that this reply from Baskar has been posted, I want to clarify. 3 months back, Baskar asked me if I could help him in a 2-day workshop. I agreed, and in my slides, I displayed my company logo to which Baskar objected, and said only his company logo should be displayed. I then removed my company logo for the rest of the workshop, and politely declined to involve in any further of his requests to help. 


So in this thread when Baskar asked for help, again I asked for clarity; and after 3 emails, it has emerged Baskar cannot do the program with his company; but he is still insisting others to do only on behalf of ilugc, whatever that means. 

---------------- 

The aim of ilugc is to spread the knowledge, awareness and use of FOSS. I will do this to the best of my ability, and largely I will be charging some money for these activities. I do not feel guilty about it, since Free in FOSS stands for Freedom, not Gratis. Instead of arguing, I am going to post about the potential, skills available; projects needed, opportunities etc. revolving around FOSS. If needed, I will put [Commercial] tag to all such posts to satisfy the pedants. The growth of FOSS is more important than petty arguments in a mailing list.

I am not blaming anyone for not answering. The mail directs people to use
their comfortable OS. Further, it explains that there is no use in helping
those who donot contribute.
I am questioning them.

I have nowhere written about posting recommendation. (Infact I support them

Your quoting and replying style seems to be different and
non-standard. Most email clients and webmail software use '>' as a
quote indicator and quotes using '>' or properly displayed in most of
them. Even '|" which Shakti Kannan uses has a distinct formatting is
easy to understand and follow. So I request you to use standard
quoting methods so that your emails are understood properly.

EDT.

Ten projects will be hosting hackathons during the celebration: Commotion,
coreboot, Gnash, GNOME, GNU FM, GNU MediaGoblin, GNU Octave, GNU social,
Tahoe-LAFS, and Tor. Most of these hackathons will have an online presence
as well, so visit the event page <https://gnu.org/gnu30/celebration> on
September 28th to participate virtually.

And for those of you who'd like to make sure GNU begins its next decade in
its strongest financial position ever, we encourage you to consider
donating<https://my.fsf.org/associate/support_freedom>or attending our
special
fundraising dinner
<https://crm.fsf.org/civicrm/event/info?id=11&reset=1>on September
27th at Rendezvous in Cambridge.

Of course, if you're in it for the cake, you'll have to be at the
celebration in person. And you won't want to miss the opportunity to meet
many early contributors to GNU, project maintainers, privacy and security
experts, and more. So, register
today<https://crm.fsf.org/civicrm/event/register?id=10&reset=1>,
book that last minute plane ticket, mark your calendars, and tell your
friends. We'll see you in Boston!

Happy hacking,

This situation calls for clear rules.

Key Words: "jointly organized by", "organized by", "organized by X1 in
collaboration with X2 ", "supported by ".

If Ilugc has no control over an event, then why should it be associated?

"on behalf of" should be banned unless it is about "representing the
GLUG in an event".

Commercial interests were being used for brand enhancement  through
the use of "on behalf of" at the cost of ilugc.

That should have been:

 "on behalf of ilugc" was used for enhancing commercial brands.

Message-ID: <1275046491.344158.1379610791750.JavaMail.root@mail.kgisl.org>



In this post, I want to outline my thoughts regarding Intel processors ; and why the FOSS community ought to distance itself from Intel and move towards ARM processors. 


In my view, FOSS is more a philosophy, and a way of life, and applies to many other aspects than mere software. Since Intel is part of the "Trusted Computing Group" which governs the specification of the TCPA; I think it is safe to assume that Intel has implemented TCPA in all their recent product lines, such as Haswell an Atom. 

ARM Holdings licenses the technology to several dozens of manufacturers; leading to the tremendous innovations we have seen in mobile devices, SoCs; SBCs such as Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone; which are unheard of in the Intel or x86 world. 

When Linus Torvalds was approached for introducing changes in the kernel to parse binaries as part of secure boot process, he reacted violently, and in a series of mailing list postings; lucidly explained the true meaning of 'security' and 'trust'. 

A college in Coimbatore has implemented Linux in about 650 out of 700 PCs. But still they are all Intel PCs. Now that the Raspberry Pi is a fairly decent PC capable of running 'Linux'; it's only drawback is slow GUI performance. I have searched in vain for readily available low cost ARM PCs or Server systems, capable of running Linux (not Android). If any one has any links to share, it would be useful to the community.

        When he said "bend or bow", what he meant was, they expect
direct answers to their questions. And you agree to it as well. Now,
there are 2 things - Paid technical support and informal user groups.
I will explain these two further down.

         Let's be frank - If someone can subscribe to a mailing list
and post a question, do you tell that they cannot type it in their web
search engine and get a result ? They just want readymade answers(They
=> people who behave that way, not all newbies). They don't want to
work towards an answer.

         No, it is not applicable only for them. This is where we get
into paid technical support(like the mechanic shop) and user groups.
Fore eg. if an Applie iPad misbehaves and you take it to a Apple
center(what ever it is called), they don't ask you technical
questions. Same with any tech support for computers as well.

         But let's say there is an online forum for people who work on
Thermodymanics. If someone asks "What do you mean by 2nd law of
thermodynamics", do you think people will patiently answer ? Most
likely, they will ask him to look it up in the web. The same happens
here.

            Install fests and SFDs are to create awareness. But with

         Misunderstanding. Most newbies who expect immediate answers,
assume that they have done GNU/Linux a favour by agreeing to use it. I
have seen that attitude among dozens are people who are exposed to
GNU/Linux for the first time, after using other operating systems for
a few years.

I would go for RHEL/CentOS (and any LTS distro with commercial support
in the offing) with 10 years lifetime. It's a no brainer.

I do understand newer hardware always not always being supported. But
then the advantages are:
1. Commercial enterprises would like stable, rock-solid "bread and
butter platform to run their business.
2. The Level 1 and Level 2 sysadmins feels more at comfort with that
cycle. 6 months is too short a time for gaining mastery over any
technology. Familiarity is maybe. They often have to attend to
heterogenous environment.
3. even at personal level, such frequent update distributions, when
one gets working it is preferred to have a stable work environment
instead of marching an upgrade threadmill.
4. AFAIK, Fedora is mulling about LTS version.

Short release cycle means considerable wastage of resources esp on
documentation, publicity, promotion and release engineering.

Packages may also break and get dropped at release time.

Distribution Upgrades may not work so smoothly on bleeding edge
distros like Fedora.

Sabayon releases often, but it follows a rolling release model and
that is always better.
Arch Linux again follows a rolling release model.
PCLinuxOS, Mageia need an year.

Do "many" distros follow a 6-month release cycle?

For my purposes, I prefer Debian, Scientific Linux, Kubuntu LTS
In all these dist upgrades happen very smoothly.
Fedora testing is on my torrent box.

In many college/University labs people install Fedora .... these never
get dist-upgraded and remain stuck at ancient versions.

Why Facebook and not anyother Libre social network that can be
self-hosted (example - Diaspora, Friendica, StatusNet, Pump.io)? That
way we can have full control over the privacy and the data of the
users. Of course on Facebook a lot of people already have accounts and
are active, but when people can join a mailing list to participate,
why not a social network? If we do such a thing we will also be
promoting free software instead of proprietary, vendor locked, walled
gardens. That said, I am okay with posting events and notifications on
all the popular social networks.

Thanks & Regards,

Wonderful suggestion. I would be happy to host such a social network server in my company's servers (for free as in beer, as well) if all are agreeable to the idea. As a FOSS community, we must not promote companies or ideologies opposed to the principles of FOSS. (Guruprasad, my Zimbra email client has formatting issues for postings to this list alone).

Hi Priyanka,

Here are my thoughts on this subject.

If users want the latest or bleeding edge sotware (mostly the case on
personal computers), they can always keep upgrading to the latest
release. Even if they don't want to follow such a short upgrade cycle
and have reasonably latest software, distros like Ubuntu have LTS
releases that get a lot updates backported from the newer releases and
are supported for a longer time.

For servers it makes sense to stick to stable and thoroughly tested
releases like that of Debian which are rock-solid work just fine
compromising the need to have the latest software in favour of
slightly dated versions. Mostly in production environments, people
tend to prefer no changes unless they require newer software or want
to upgrade to the newer release which comes out once in a few years.

I use a combination of Debian unstable and testing on my laptop and
that helps me have the bleeding edge software. Of course there are
greater chances for crashes and critical bugs to make the desktop
unusable, but with a little bit of know-how it is very much possible
to recover from such scenarios. I prefer rolling releases of distros
instead of one big fat release that comes out every 6 months or so as
the downloads are incremental instead of bulky. Debian suits me best
here.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Thats one hell of a reason I'm on sabayon. In my openion,

1) If you want a stable production environment, go for a distro who give
support.(eg: RHEL,CenOS,Debian-stable,Ubuntu-LTS)

2) If you want a stable desktop environment with latest packages, go for
any distro who do rolling release. You install once, forget about
re-installing. all you need is do a package update once in a month. Its
perfectly suitable for developers who don't want to reinstall their
hard-to-find-library-packages again-and-again. Besides, it gives you a
feel that there is no disturbance in your main focus. (eg: arch,
sabayon, gentoo, Debian-testing, LMDE)

3) For newbies or sysadmins who want to explore, go for cutting-edge
distros. (eg: ubuntu,fedora,Debian-unstable,LFS)

Thanks,
Mohan R

This is an interesting point. And, I'd like to understand how often do
you have libraries which are not packaged and available in your
distribution. Is it more of a specific version or, there is a lack of
packaged software?

Its not about package-ing, its about re-installing. for example, I
installed libgsm (in sabayon/gentoo world its media-sound/gsm package)
for a specific purpose (for libdhvani development). No other
common/basic application depend on this library to come to your system
automatically when you do re-install your main distro 6 month once. You
have to remember it or not it down somewhere and have to re-install this
library. In sabayon, I installed once, and its rolling whenever there is
a fresh update to libgsm in sabayon repos.

Joke1:

Interviewer: did you guys approached by NSA for a back-door?
Linus: (after big smile with others and says) NOooooooooooo!!!!!!!

Joke2:

Interviewer: talk about Virtualization.. how things are moving on that
part?
Linus: all these virtualization stuff I don't have anything to do with
it. because I want to run [linux] in real hardware.. real man (and looks
at sarah sitting beside him and says..) and women do that.. (audience

Dear Members

I would like to know if there are any guidelines to get an article
published on wikipedia. I was told that if the article is about "self
promotion", it will NOT be approved.

However, I do see quite a number of "self-promotion" articles on Wikipedia.
Our *objective* is to publish an article that talks about the services we
offer. Someone even suggested that you need to hire a freelance writer who
writes articles for Wikipedia. Not sure if that is true.

Any pointers will be very helpful.

Hameed

A nice demo video reel on Blender, in case yu've not seen it yet.
My fav demo of theirs is the Big Buck Bunny (2008) animation
short-film which have shown it to many kids and they've all relished
it. I am sure many of you have watched it as well.

Hi Hameed,

You need to hire Content writer for writing better articles and please make
sure it do not have any duplicate or copy from any other website. duplicate
content leads to fall in search ranking.

Anyone can write wikipedia articles.

Simple guideline. Article should give true information and data.
It should not be a advertisement.

Dear All,




Here is my problem. I works on servers. In the recent days many of the
servers are getting hanged. so the servers need to reboot continuously. I
am unable to find the reasons to resolve or troubleshoot the issue. the
symptoms that i found during the system hang.

1. Multiple Crons are running at a time

2. Only a single process consuming most of the memory usage.

I found these things in /var/log/messages. I want to know any other logs to
check the system performance and i need the troubleshooting guide.

I use the IBM X3650 Servers. The OS is suse Linux and Centos.


Thanks in advance

Hi Rajesh,


You have to change your default runlevel. Ubuntu use Upstart.

Hi Manoj,

Install and configure sysstat package which contains sar utility. Using sar
collect performance data and try to identify any clue for bottlenecks.

To: mailinglist at fsftn.org


Dear Friends,

The week-long celebrations of free software came to an end with Software
Freedom Day celebrated in a grand manner at College of Engineering, Guindy,
Anna university on Sunday September 22. Nearly 150 participants attended
the programme and nearly 15 stalls vied for the top position in the stall
competition. The event was organised by Free Software Foundation Tamil
Nadu, Indian Linux Users Group Chennai and College of  Engineering
GNU/LINUX Users' groups.

The event was a great occasion for experienced Linux buffs and newbies to
share their knowledge and discuss aspects related to community building.
Talks were held on ?Why we celebrate SFD?, Open Hardware, Internet
surveillance, Women and technology, Systems integration, Wikipedia and
Patents. A lot of the discussion was focussed on preserving our hard-won
freedom and extending it, both in the realms of hardware and software.

Students at the stalls presented a diverse variety of topics stretching
from the PRISM surveillance project to GIMP and Inkscape and Python and
Emacs. A group of students from Anjalai Ammal Mahalaingam Engg. college won
the best stall prize for their stall on network booting while students from
Sri Sairam Institute of technology came second. A special round of applause
for the students and volunteers who designed creative and thought-provoking
posters and charts that were widely shared online and displayed at the
venue.

Over the last week, volunteers went to many colleges across the city and
spread word about the event.

FSFTN would like to thank the staff members, CEG administration officials,
participants and above all, the committed and dedicated volunteer team for
making the event a grand success. We promise we will be back next year,
stronger than ever!

You have to write custom plugin for this. Search and read on how to write
plugins for nagios.

If is more urgent, hire a freelance or part time developer to write that
plugin for you.

Hello Ubuntu Studio Developers, contributors and users,

"Keep calm and test the images!" -- Ubuntu QA Team

We are now close to our second and final beta release of Ubuntu Studio
13.10 (Saucy Salamander), and we want YOU to test for us.

http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/303/builds is the place
where you follow the testcases and submit the results, simply choose
"Ubuntu Studio <insert_your_architecture>", and follow the testcases.
If you want a walkthrough, check out
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ISO/Walkthrough.

There are not many changes from Beta 1 to Beta 2 (except that we fixed
4 bugs about upgrading). Changes in features can be found at
http://ubuntustudio.org/2013/09/ubuntu-studio-13-10-saucy-salamander-beta-1-released/.
So we want you to test the upgrades again, to see if there is any more
bugs. (Of course you can report bugs in images too:))

The images are always accessible at
http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntustudio/dvd/current.

For any inquiries, find us at ubuntu-studio-devel at lists.ubuntu.com or
contact zequence/OvenWerks/smartboyhw in #ubuntustudio-devel on
Freenode.

Happy testing!

Regards,
Howard Chan (smartboyhw)
Ubuntu Studio Release Manager

I second this..   we can also use Buddypress with Group Hierarchy, which
would be best suited for decentralised discussion..  i am currently using
this for my personal project and it helps me localise discussion based on
groups..

We can create separate groups based on topics, and ask new comers to post
their doubts in the corresponding groups..  the group hierarchy plugin  (
http://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-group-hierarchy/ ) enables us to create sub
groups within existing groups..

Apologizing for Top Posting.   The new google composer hides the previous
mail content and i did not notice it..

Now, i have another suggestion..  why cant the group server be used for
ILUGC?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GroupServer

it provides multiple mailing list under common user base, which would be
best suitable for this decentralised discussion..

The reason for the creation of a FB group is to attract more volunteers
into the community, etc. It not because of the lack of functionality.
Sadly, no other social network has the popularity even to Facebook in
India.
Even though I am personally not a fan of Facebook, it will provide ILUGC to
get more volunteers to organize events. And members like me who prefer the
mailing list, can continue taking part in the discussions here. :)

Message-ID: <CAArwaQQsr7-bWAbQ5oFAay4f2F6NsqitTmMBT51RZjzCmRV=6w@mail.gmail.com>

HI

Recently i purchased new DELL VOSTRO 2420 MODEL LAPTOP. In that i
installed  centos 6.4 x86_64 and the kernel version is
2.6.32-358.el6.x86_64.

IN that, Wireless is not working with that OS.I used lspci command, it
shows the Network Controller : Broadcom Corporation BCM43142 802.11b/g/n
(rev 01).
Ethernet Controller : Realtek Semiconductor RTL8111/8168B PCI Express
Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 07)

In ubuntu 12.04, it is working fine. But in centos 6.4 (x86_64 ), it is not
working .

Any solutions for this one?

By process of elimination, it is apparent that the CentOS stock installed
kernel does not have the driver for your Wi-Fi card.

You have two options:

1. check if CentOS has a newer kernel package than that which is installed.
 You may be lucky that the driver for your Wi-Fi card has been "back ported"
2. If not, then backport the driver from a newer kernel and compile it for
2.6.
3. Download the latest stable 3.10.x kernel, compile a RPM for CentOS.
4. Revert to Ubuntu, if you don't like Ubuntu then try some other distro
with a 3.2.x kernel (recommend Debian Wheezy) or higher.

I am thinking on how can anyone contribute to our mailing list.

The following are the things, I can think of.


One Day one Free Software
Interesting Links you get

Series of tutorials on following stuff

html5
css3
javascript
node.js
sql
nosql
cloud computing
virtualization

Various Event notifications
Job announcement

Latest happenings in the FOSS world


Can you pick anyone and start contributing to our list regularly?
Just like dhanasekar is doing with his 1 day 1 command.

Share if you have more ideas on how to make our list content rich.

Thanks.

It is also possible that the CentOS firmware package does not have the
firmware for your card, whereas Ubuntu does.

A diff of file lists from /lib/firmware in respective distro should get you
started in locating the firmware file.

Some of the dell systems like dell 5420 which are having the same 
wireless as specified by the Gopal krishan comes with preloaded ubuntu 
11.10 or 12.04 . So the drivers available for ubuntu are taken from the 
disk images of these systems and are easily available  both in deb and 
rpm packages.

This is even better but ... Gopal krishnan needs to come back with what

There are a couple of bits that need to be cleared up.

[1] there is a growing number of young students who are interested in
picking up skills that help them use and contribute to upstream Free
and Open Source projects. While Google Summer of Code has certainly
stimulated this growth, the increasing number of hackathons, meetups
and, dev-camps have provided the environment in which quick hacks can
lead to interesting outcomes

[2] a good number of the above are moving away from traditional UGs
(perhaps because LUGs in India are often perceived to be "help me
install software or, configure hardware" social forums)

[3] the TWITCH group companies that you mention above are involved
both as consumers of Open Source as well as being contributors.

Just curious - how many LUGs are functional, as in with active lists and
with frequent meatspace events?

Nice write up Sir.

Points to add:
* In case of a seminar / workshop, collect the slides from presenters and
archive it at a common place. If necessary / permissible distribute them to
the participants / community.

* To facilitate people to reach without much hassle, location co ordinates
may be provided. (People with GPS may make use of it).
If possible, a route map (with Boarding Points / Bus No. / Railway station
/ Train ) from important locations may also be provided to participants .
(For instance, for Chennai, routes from Chennai Central / Egmore /
Koyambedu)
(This may help people from other cities to reach destination)

P.S: The points I mentioned are just suggestions, not mandatory requirements

Message-ID: <CAKGmkL3HbM7Y+auuwj5jL+viotHA-sqrFjgz_V6WdEM6o85aOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

My nephew recently bought components on flipkart to assemble a gaming PC.

1. Intel Core i5 3579
2. ASRock Z77 Extreme 3 Mobo
3. 2x4GB RAM
4. Sapphire AMD/ATI HD 7870 2GB GDDR5 Flex Edition 2 GB GDDR5 Graphics Card

Unfortunately when we assembled it and switched it on, the system beeped 5
times. Looks like this indicates a processor error! I would like to know if
any of you know a professional assembler who can perhaps use a different
processor and see if the problem is really with it or it is the mother
board!

Need to find which is the offending component so it can be sent back for
replacement.

Thanks very much,
mano

= September Monthly Meet

== Date & Time

28 September
3:00pm to 5:00pm

== Venue

Zilogic Systems,
Fourth Main Road,
Kamaraj Nagar,
Thiruvanmiyur,
Chennai

Location map: http://www.zilogic.com/contact.html

== Agenda

Talk 1: Setting up your Python Environment
by Prasanna Venkadesh
Duration: 45min

Getting started with a language like Python is bullet-fast, but
picking up the Standard practices on the way requires time and
effort. This talk will explain about setting the environment before
getting started with a Python / Django project using VirtualEnv,
VirtualEnvwrapper, Pip / easy_install, Fabrics. Following such
practices would make the development easier.

Talk 2: Python Byte Code Hacking
by Vijay Kumar
Duration: 45min

The Python interpreter converts Python programs into byte codes and
executes them. In this talk we will understand what these byte codes
mean, how to disassemble them and how to modify them to do some really
cool stuff. We will work our way up with small examples and at the end
of the talk we will have our own working implementation of this recipe
-- http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576944-the-goto-decorator/

If you would like to give a lightning talk, just come prepared, we
will be able to accommodate you.

If you are new to Python, the tutorial at
http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/ will give you a quick
overview of what Python is all about.

Regards,
Vijay

Hi everyone,

I'm happy to announce that RubyConf India 2014 will happen in Goa sometime
during March next year. Please help us get the word out by forwarding this
email to any other communities/groups/lists you think may be interested.

* Location: Goa
* Venue: TBD
* Mailing list: Goa RUG list -
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/goa-ruby
* Dates: 22nd and 23rd March (tentative, pending confirmation of venue)
* Website: http://rubyconfindia.org
* Twitter: http://twitter.com/rubyconfindia

Here's the quick summary for those of you new to the community or new to
RubyConf India:
* RubyConf India is the Indian branch of the annual, international Ruby
Conf.

* RubyConf India is an annual event and 2014 will be fifth Indian RubyConf.
Previous years speakers and talks are available at http://rubyconfindia.org

* RubyConf India typically sees 500+ people participate every year and
includes notable members of the local and international Ruby community. In
2013, we had 80 international delegates and early bird tickets were sold
out in under 1 hour!

* Part of our agenda is promoting the host city's RUG by co-ordinating the
event through their list. Since the next RubyConf India will be in Goa,
those of you interested in helping out should sign up at
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/goa-ruby

* We have a bunch of things to put in place ahead of the conference -
raising sponsorship money, identifying keynote speakers, setting up the CFP
and last but not least, venue logistics (A/V, internet, food, swag etc.).
All of these things will be announced/discussed on the GoaRUG list. Some of
them will require local volunteers so if you're up for it, do sign up on
the list!

* We would also request you to follow/support/retweet the RubyConf India
twitter account at http://twitter.com/rubyconfindia - all of our
announcements will go out through this twitter account.

For more info, please join or watch the GoaRUG list. You can also reach out
to the RubyConf India team via this list or by emailing
team at rubyconfindia.org; we will be making regular announcements over the
next few months.

Here's looking forward to yet another super-awesome RubyConf India!

Best,
Sidu Ponnappa.

 Do you know python, or perhaps you are willing to learn? Ubuntu quality
needs you! We have several oppurtunties for you to write tests and help
ubuntu out, while having a little fun and automating things.

The core apps still have a few testcases which need to be written, as
features are written, tests are needed;
http://www.theorangenotebook.com/2013/07/automated-testing-workshops.html,
http://www.theorangenotebook.com/2013/06/testing-all-things-introduction.html
Also, our exploratory testing on the phones is generating a nice list of
bugs, and many of those are worthy of autopilot tests;
http://www.theorangenotebook.com/2013/09/testing-ubuntu-touch-final-month-before.html
Or if Qt/QML apps aren't your thing, we are also working on automating our
iso tests, and could use a hand in writing automating further testcases;
https://plus.google.com/104307250302998042813/posts/Uv6fcD4BDZK

If any of these sound interesting to you, please contact me for further
information and help. Let me help you get connected. Happy Testing!

Dear friends,

Check out the very first release of the translatewiki.net Android app
at google's Play store.

For those of you who use iOS, you might want to check it out at
Apple's appStore.

Visit the app's support page for more info.


Note: this app has been developed as part of the "Google Summer of
Code" program, which has just come to it's end. It would be a nice
opportunity to publicly thank Niklas Laxstr?m and Yuvaraj Pandian for
their great mentorship, guidance and care. Thanks very much indeed! :)

Thanks,
Or Sagi

Hello , can anyone help me out . I have installed FreeRadius in Ubuntu and
configured it to authenticate with MS Active Directory for WiFi clients .
WiFi Clients get IP Addresses from a DHCP Server . Now is it somehow
possible that the LAN DHCP clients will also get authentication from
FreeRadius . I cannot use MySql  in Freeradius as it is authenticated with
Active Directory , and so Freeradius cannot be used as DHCP Server . Also
there is no option to use the Switch as client to FreeRadius for some
internal issues.

So , the only option left is to configure the DHCP Server as FreeRadius
Client and the DHCP (LAN)clients will be assigned IP Addresses from the
DHCP Server . Please suggest

ulimit?   It is a built-in bash function; "man bash"  for the gory details.

Well u can set the limit/ulimit itself in your shell that invokes it.

I would doubt if you script consumes so much memory - check ur script if not write up a C program that invokes the script and sets the memory limits.

Hi,

Your program might be suffering from a bad memory leak (the program is
allocating memory on heap without properly freeing them - for example).
You might want to re-compile the program with debugging switch (-g 
for g++) and run the same under valgrind[1] and investigate the code thats
leaking memory. You can also try running the program linked with 
dmalloc[2] or libduma[3].

In simple, there is no solution in the shell than to fix the memory leak bug in 
your program and rebuild the same.

[2] http://www.dmalloc.com/
[3] http://duma.sourceforge.net/

ah this one takes me back in time of pagers[1] then PDA's like Agenda[2]
simputer[3] and pianomails[4] , also the latest aakash[5] to join the
league.

one thing all of them have in common was media hype then failures , history
is a good teacher for the people with who are planning to build hardware or
software products it always pays to do some web research before starting
off.

to be frank still i did not understand your question , can you elaborate a

You can use any text editor to develop Rails. Sublime text 2 is a very
popular one whose evaluation version is free.

>when I create a new app then I keep on typing code it self..or... using
>command to install some gem,bundle...related to the app....
For installing all the dependencies, you can run bundle install. This
looks at the GemFile and resolves all the dependecies for you. the GemFile
has a list of all the gems that your application needs.

The rails command line can be used to autogenerate a lot of code
(controllers, views actions) etc. A good idea would be to watch railscasts (
http://railscasts.com/) to get started.

Thanks,
GR

Please avoid recommending non-free (free as in freedom) software on
this list. There are plenty of FOSS editors/IDEs like Emacs, Vim,
NetBeans, Eclipse and etc.

It is an unwritten policy that has been followed in this list ever
since its inception.

Shrini, perhaps we could add this to the mailing list guidelines.

Which c/c++ sourcecode you see O4 optimization? AFAIK, there is,

-O0 - For debugging
-O1 - optimize
-O2 - optimize more
-O3 - optimize most
-Os - optimize for size
-Ofast - non-standard optimization

See man gcc(1). Anything above -O3 is just -O3[1].

# September meet minutes

The September meetup for Chennai.py was held at Zilogic Systems office
at 3-5pm on Sat 28 Sep2013.
Nearly 20 people attended it. The meet started with Vijay giving an
introduction on the Python language before going into his talk on
ByteCode Hacking. It included a comparison of Python with C, with
reference to Python's dynamic type system. The examples of signed and
unsigned integers and buffer sizes in C were used for comparison.

## Bytecode hacking by Vijay Kumar

The talk started off with an example implementation of a new
programming language. There were two approaches to writing the code,
first was string based and the second byte-code based. [I don't have
the examples here, please add]. The first was more human readable
while the second was faster. Python langauge does both - programs are
written as human readable strings, and they are converted to a byte
code on first execution. All subsequent executions use the byte code
only (saved as a .pyc file) to avoid the parsing overhead. This also
happens on the Python prompt.

After this there were details on how the Python interpreter reads
objects from the heap, updates them and then stores them back. This
process of object manipulations happens using the byte-code
instructions. The code objects are also stored in the heap only. The
interpreter uses a stack machine while operating on these objects. The
objects are stored by reference and not by value. There was some more
discussion on what stack and register machines were. The JVM also uses
a stack machine, while examples of register machine were Android, Lua
and the Dalvik VM (for performance reasons I think).

Next there was a demonstration on how the bytecode looks and works for
a sample method -

def hello():
 print "Hello world"

There's a handy '__code__' property on the method object ('hello'
here) which gives the code object. The code object contains a lot of
meta-data about the piece of code. It contains the bytecode as the
'co_code' property. So the following gets the byte code -

hello.__code__.co_code

That would show the bytecode as a hex text, and to see it in more
readable form, we can use the 'disassemble' method from 'dis' library.

    dis.disassemble(hello.__code__)
  0 LOAD_CONST               1 ('Hello World')
  3 PRINT_ITEM
  4 PRINT_NEWLINE
  5 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
  8 RETURN_VALUE

Here he explained how the each part of the byte-code is working. After
this there was another example using a 'sum_ab', and then another one
for a loop. (More details in the ipynb document:
https://github.com/bravegnu/python-byte-code). The loop example
demonstrated how the byte-code performs the jump operation using the
JUMP_ABSOLUTE and POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE byte-code instructions. The talk
ended at an interesting implementation of 'goto' (which doesn't exist
in Python) using byte-code manipulations. This would be covered at a
talk in the next meetup.

In between there was also a discussion on why to learn bytecode
manipulation, on which the speaker mentioned that it was not necessary
and one can be a good Python programmer without knowing it, but it is
good fun and helps us understand how the language works internally. He
also mentioned the activestate recipes site where many such
interesting code snippets can be found. (which I think is this:
http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python)


## Python environment setup by Prasanna Venkatesh

This started with Venkatesh talking about Pep008 and Autopep8, which
are tools for helping encorce styling on Python programs. There is a
standard style guide maintained by the Python community (I forgot the
name of the guide) which details on how Python code should look. It
describes things like the spaces between operands, number of
spaces/tabs for indentation etc. The pep008 command tells us where all
the guidelines are violalted in our code, and autopep corrects them.
There was a philisophical discussion about why one should follow such
a style guide and not have one's own style. On which the speaker
mentioned it is better to follow standard styles if the code has to be
open sourced.

Then he proceeded to talk about pip. Pip is the installer tool for
Python libraries. Most Python libraries are published at python.org,
and pip fetches and installs them to our computer. It is a replacement
for 'easy_install' which was used earlier for the job. pip comes with
a few subcommands like 'pip install', 'pip search', 'pip uninstall'
and 'pip freeze'. pip freeze is notable here, as it can be used to
freeze the versions of libraries used for a project and write them to
a 'requirement.txt' file. When needed, all the mentioned libraries and
versions on the file can be installed accurately using -

pip install -r requirements.txt

After this the topic covered was 'vitualenv'. The purpose of
virtualenv is to isolate the python enviroment at the project level,
such that multiple projects on a computer can have a separate python
version and separate set of libraries that don't interfere with each
other. virtualenv creates the environments on separate directories
that can get scattered all over, so there's a 'virtualenvwrapper' that
keeps it cleaner. [Please help me expand this part as I didn't take
down the examples.]

There was also a discussion on whether pip will overwrite an existing
library if a new version has come, and the conlusion was that its
better to specify the version number in pip when such a scenario is
likely. There was also a discussion on the comparison between the
python byte-code and JVM byte-code. Here the main difference stated
was that Python byte-code is 'closer' to the code, and Java's
byte-code is 'closer' to the machine. And Python's byte-code is
dependent on the Python version too.

That's all. Please add/correct if I missed something here.
Thanks,
Abhishek

Anything beyond -O3 has no effect other than -O3's effect. You can
check these options at the source:
