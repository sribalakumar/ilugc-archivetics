Message-ID: <CACtiFJb=EFvzWH9FSJFTGRreDiJ-GJtV1BvdpZc4nS-X_kYQDw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

A two days faculty development programme on FOSS was organised by Dept. of
Computer Applications, Valliammai Engineering College on 28/06/12 &
29/06/12.

Faculty members from various institutions attended the FDP.  The total no.
of participants was about 35.

The session started with FOSS introduction and continued with
installation.  All participants were busy installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on
their desktops remotely (through FOSS lab server). More than 80 Ubuntu
12.04 DVDs were provided to the participants and staff members of the
college.

An introduction was given about the equivalent applications available in
Ubuntu.  After installation, they were introduced to package management
system using apt, tasksel, synaptic and also the default Ubuntu software
centre. The participants tried installing many popular applications from
the local ubuntu repository.

The second day, Mr.Shrinivasan gave an introduction to Python programming
and also about version control system using Subversion with a live demo
using Collabnet SVNEdge.

We would like to thank the Principal Dr. Balasubramanian / Dr. Pandurangan
- HOD/MCA and Mr. Santhana Mariappan - FDP Co-ordinator for organizing the
FDP.

With warm regards

       When do you get this error ? Have you enabled any auth
mechanism on your server ? Also, when you send mails over telnet, what
happens ? Can you please run tshark for just smtp and paste the
results here ?(Just do tshark -f'tcp port 25' -i any and paste the
results). If the tshark output is huge, use something like paste bin
and share the link here. Thanks

Has the owner of the domain contracted you and given you permission to
use the domain?   From the whois record, the domain owner appears to
be located in the Netherlands with it's own MX and NS records.

Use any of the following example.com, example.net, example.org  if you
are doing this for your own interest and make sure you are also
running a local DNS server that resolves *all* record types i.e. NS,
MX etc. for the domain you select.

I normally use "intra.example.com" for an internal SMTP server and
then work my way upwards to the Internet cloud.

Additionally, look up "smarhost relay" settings in postfix.

The best way to learn how to set your combination of services is by
testing diffferent scenarios.   Besides, the error messages that pop
in the client, you should also look that the postfix log file(s) in
/var/log.  Most services give you enough details to figure out what
the problem is.

Subject: [Ilugc] why it is important to promote linux
Message-ID: <1341216401.18526.53.camel@xlquest.web>

hi,

caveat - this is a long Girish-style post full of my personal opinions,
so if you continue reading it, do not blame me - you have been
warned ;-)

First, some background: some years back I attended a foss promotion
meeting attended by big shots from IBM, Sun, HP etc. The HP guy was most
vehement in supporting open source and attacking Microsoft. I asked why
all his ads say 'Compaq recommends Microsoft Windows'. He said that
Microsoft pays a big subsidy to any company that puts in that sentence
in their ads, so the marketing people put it in. Also Microsoft will not
pay if some models come with Linux and the word 'linux' is prominent. If
the word is there, it should be in the smallest possible type.

At times Acer (and some other companies) release models - usually
flagship models - that ship with linux. The rule laid down by Microsoft
is that this should be mentioned in small type and the recommendation of
Windows in a very prominent position. In short, Microsoft does it's best
to see that the term Linux does not get prominence anywhere. So what
else is new - we all know this.

What we all do not realise is that a lot of companies that produce linux
distros - and a lot of people who use the said distros are also helping
Microsoft to play down the term Linux. If one looks at the sites of
redhat, fedora, suse, debian, mandriva, one finds plentiful mention of
the word linux. But the word is missing in the sites of two 'popular'
distros - android and ubuntu. If you ask most Linux users what OS they
use, they will say 'Linux' (or GNU/Linux). But if you ask people using
distros like Ubuntu or android, they will say 'Ubuntu' or 'android'.

Similarly hardware companies that ship machines with linux are persuaded
to use terms like 'we ship with ubuntu' or 'we ship with android' rather
than say 'we ship with linux'.

I will not go into how the distros that disown Linux also fail to
contribute back to the community ... this is too well known.

So let us promote - and encourage others to promote - Linux (or, if you
so desire GNU/Linux.

Ubuntu did use the term "linux" once for its famous slogan " Linux for
Human beings" when it was introducing its distribution based at PCs .
But once they reached a fair share of market and when the CD
distribution was at a peak stage they shifted and dropped the name
linux all together .

Coming to Android , they are a modified linux kernel ( so are also
others) with binary blobs which somehow doesn't bring it close to FOSS
eco system and hence many didn't mind the missing term .
I guess its upto google to give attribution where its due and stop
being "evil" which was and I guess is still its motto .

Pavithran

In my opinion, fragmenting the Linux brand as Ubuntu or Android or other 
brands is a good thing. For long, one person has embezzled the credit 
for the work of the entire community.

GNU has contributed the most to the base system. But it should be 
mentioned that, the most commonly used softwares such as email clients, 
web browsers, web servers, multimedia editing/viewing, gaming, GUI shell 
(kde) and so on are contributed by a vast and diverse section of the 
community.

Even though, I support RMS on GNU/Linux name, to fully represent the end 
product, the name should be totally random or a representation of the 
community as a whole.

I would say promote Linux as a product but not as a brand.

I wasn't kidding. I just think, their contribution to the list will be 
invaluable, even if non-technical, since they have direct contact with 
the students. I don't expect them to be super active but just emailing 
once in a while should be no harm.

number of staff members who have actively or passively joined LUG lists
is precisely 0.

I've organised FDP as a student volunteer, working closely with the staff
members (one and half years back). From my observation, most of them
attended FDPs just for the certificates. They believe such certificates add
value to their profile and that it helps in their career growth; no
different from the attitude of majority of students. Yes, it was shocking.

There were very few staff who attended with genuine interest. But making
that interest sustain requires lot more effort than such 2-3 day
programmes, IMHO.

P.S: I'm not generalising things. I'm just saying what I observed.

it is the nature of staff members in our colleges to be terrified of
appearing foolish in front of students, so they avoid any forums where
there is a possibility of this happening.

Hmmm. Possible. But I believe it is lot more mundane than that. Life goes on
whether they know something or not. So there is no real need to learn, much
less learn *after* a training program.

As has been mentioned more than once, the only driver for many people
-- teachers, students all-- if not a vast majority, is the certificate.

<quote>
Linus Torvalds shared the Linux kernel on some internet groups for MINIX
users. Linus first called the operating system "Freax". The name Freax
came from joining up the English words "free" and "freak", and adding an
X to the name because Unix has an X in its name. Ari Lemmke, who worked
with Linus at the University, was responsible for the servers that Freax
was stored on. Ari did not think Freax was a good name, so he called the
project "Linux" without asking Linus. Later, Linus agreed that Linux was
a better name for his project.

Embezzlement is the act of dishonestly withholding assets for the
purpose of conversion (theft), of such assets by one or more individuals
to whom such assets have been entrusted, to be held and/or used for
other purposes.

<quote>
The practice of quoting out of context, sometimes referred to as
"contextomy" or "quote mining", is a logical fallacy and a type of false
attribution in which a passage is removed from its surrounding matter in
such a way as to distort its intended meaning.
</quote>

The context in this post is the huge financial and propaganda effort
being put in by Microsoft to prevent the spread of linux (or call it
open source or foss) - it is not the ongoing quarrel between various
people on the assignment of credit for creating parts of the open source
software ecosystem. If you want to have a thread on that subject feel
free to start your own.

congratulations - I am sure you went through each of these links to find
out where they were on the site, in what context they were there,
whether they were put there by the authors of the site and how visible
they are to the viewers of the site.

And here's one more which you can add to your collection of useless
statistics:

site:microsoft.com linux    322,000

that is why I am qualified to talk about the advantages (for me and my
family) of using fedora over Ubuntu. I have used it for years, and still
spend a lot of time using it in helping my students to debug their
problems (many of them have ubuntu). Most people who rave about ubuntu
have no experience of other distros and are not qualified to compare.

You are manually quoting your reply in your emails, which can be
confusing to a lot of people. Kindly check your email client settings,
if you are using one and that is doing the quoting for you. Don't
manually add a '>' to the lines containing your reply.

Those were just some random stats I found after reading your original
FUD.  But then, I'm sure that when you were saying "site" and not
"page", you went through all the sites to do your due diligence?

Why is that useless?  According to the Linux Foundation [1], Microsoft
was one of the largest corporate contributors of Linux in 2011.

No I did not add another Quote manually,  Not to pin point you Guru however
I believe there are lots of policing around :-( which is really confusing
than the problem itself :-(.

      I don't think it is a FUD. Until recently, they never mentioned
the term "Linux" anywhere prominently. It was only recently that they
added it up somewhere, I guess it was their about page when people
started asking pointed questions about it. And I don't the the actual
number of occurrences of the term is of any use. As long as it is not
prominent(by prominent, I mean frequently visited pages, and the
ability to view it without having to do lots of scrolling), it is as
good as not being mentioned at all. Even then, I don't know how the
count across the whole site matters. Thanks

yes I did - spent some hours looking at the sites in question from the
end user perspective to get an overall impression on how much importance
is given to linux.

I am sure you read all the comments on this article. And of course the
original pdf from the linux foundation. 
<quote>
It is amusing to note that Linus Torvalds (1,113 total changes, 231
since 2.6.35) does not appear in either top-30
list of contributors. 
</quote>

wow - $bill contributes more to the kernel than Linus!

In general, it is a fallacy to equate number of lines of code
contributed to contribution as such. A lot of other factors need to be
considered - these factors are adequately explained in the pdf and in
the comments on the article itself. 1% of the total contributed code -
where the contribution is completely self serving ...

I apologize for trying to take the thread in a different direction, It 
was not intentional. When I read your interesting opinion on 
Ubuntu/Android and how Microsoft might have had a hand in them not using 
the term "Linux", the first thing that popped into my head was "Its a 
good thing" (debatable, of course). And, I misread the subject of the 
email as "why it is important to promote linux (brand)".

Microsoft's efforts to prevent the spread of Linux has died down a bit 
in the last few years. Even Microsoft Azure cloud service now offers 
GNU/Linux as a choice of virtual machine,

http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source-software/microsoft-run-linux-azure-195068

I am sure many of us have tried to promote GNU/Linux through word of 
mouth but that works only to a certain extent.

What that means is, the word "Linux" is not important. Promote the 
features, softwares, and the freedom that GNU/Linux offers.

I always ask myself why people waste time discussing / fighting over 
useless talks rather than spending this time on something productive. 
Ubuntu, Redhat, Debian, Fedora, Mint, Gentoo are all based on Linux. 
Linux is their heart, lungs, legs, arms etc but they all have different 
shapes, sizes etc like human beings do.

Example- How many people like beer? Beer is beer right? Thunderbolt is 
beer, haywards is beer, tuborg is beer, kingfisher is beer. Now all 
these are beer brands, do they have to write on labels everywhere that 
they are beer. When someone goes to wineshop and asks for haywards, the 
guy on counter knows he is asking for beer. Linux and all other 
derivatives are same. Gnome, KDE, Gimp etc are all part GNU/Linux.

If we all have to contribute to FOSS or GNU/Linux then just pick what 
you like and start contributing towards it.

      Do you have mydestination param set correctly in main.cf? Have
you set any recipient_restrictions ? Though it might not be directly

Message-ID: <CAGb-ingVwDzMq_-nUyjUL6czWnU_uCjz-uMinNX0a6zLOExFAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I installed gnome panel in my Ubuntu 12.04 to customize the desktop
appearance. After few days I can?t able to see the power button, date and
network connection gui in the panel.


In the login screen, If I change the option from Gnome-GUI to unity it
restores to default GUI screen of Ubuntu.

I googled this error and getting solution like right click the panel and
add the Indicator menu option. But in my pc if I right click the panel
nothing happens.


Request your suggestion to overcome the problem.

so why do you not advertise your company as shipping with Linux or
GNU/Linux or free operating system or open source operating system (take
your pick)?

why do you assume that we are not doing so? You may not be aware of the
fact that one thing that distinguishes humans from animals is the
ability to talk (and generally communicate using the spoken and written
word.) It is only donkeys, buffaloes and other beasts of burden that go
around doing productive work without talking. For us, work done without
talking about it is not productive or profitable.

I concur with our moderator -:) we should call it a halt for now. We are all in some way or another do promote Linux and its benefits and I am sure we all do understand the point. 

Please excuse me if I did not include the trailing thread.

This is probably a stupid suggestion. But, nevertheless, Did you try Alt 
+ <right-click> ? I read somewhere about using Alt + <right-click> for 
Gnome-3, or was it Ctrl + <right-click> ? Anyways, try one of them, it 
may work.

Dear Team Members,

 With regard to my PhD, I seek few minutes of your valuable personal time
in filling up the research survey on *Open Source Software Project
Management*.

 The link to access the survey is

and  the password to access the page is " *community*"

 I request you to have an inner reflection and give your option for each
statement that closely matches to your thinking or feelings.

I also suggest you to fill the questionnaire without interruption to have a
true reflection of reality.

Thanks for all your support,

Afaik, you have to create a new connection and enter the credentials
in Network Manager (not sure how things are in Linux Mint). Only after
that you will be able to connect to the internet.

       I didn't know whether you were replying to Shirini, or Jobin,
or Kenneth(as a mark of sarcasm). No one is interested in fighting. I
just asked you to follow the guidelines and you feel so agitated and
ask me to check the thread line. And, you still top post and violate
list guidelines.

       Please understand that the guidelines must be followed so that
other members of the list are not put to inconvenience by your post.
Thanks

we are asking list members to avoid top and bottom posts for long time.

we do not explain them well on why we need to avoid them.

i request you all to give your explanations on why to avoid top and bottom
post with links and screenshots.

we can post them all in our site and ask the top posters to read it.

thanks.

full detailed explanation has been worked out over the years by many of
us and has been posted in the mailing list guidelines which is also
supposed to be posted to the members once a month. The said guidelines
are available here:

+1. Fully agree with Kenneth here. If people need more details and
spoon-feeding, here is something I used to send to newbies to educate
them regarding the list etiquette and failed miserably. Almost all of
it has been taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style .

"*. Posting style:
There are multiple posting styles - top posting, bottom posting and
interleaved, trimmed posting, used when replying to emails.

When you click 'reply' in your email client (web-based like Gmail, or
desktop-based like Thunderbird, Outlook), the client quotes the email
that you are replying to, in the content of your reply. Most clients
include a character like '>' at the beginning of every quoted line to
indicate that is a quote that is a part of the reply. But some clients
like Microsoft Outlook do not do it. Multiple '>' might be used to
represent multiple levels of quoting - like quoting a quoted reply,
for example.

In top posting, the reply is on top of the email and the mail that we
are replying to is quoted below. For example:

<snip>
Hi Guru,

X

</snip>

This is an example of top posting style. Top posting is generally not
recommended on mailing lists for the following reason:
1. It is not necessary to maintain the context of the conversation in
every reply, because the replies are archived. By quoting the whole
email, we are sending unnecessary data to all the subscribers which is
a waste of bandwidth.
2. Top posted emails make the recipient read the email from bottom to
top to understand the context and that is the opposite of the normal
reading direction of humans - top to bottom. This is an inconvenience
most of the times.
3. Another problem is that top-posters often word their replies on the
assumption that you just read the previous message, even though their
perversity has put it further down the page than you have yet read.
4. Top posts contain cascaded replies below and the content to which
the poster is replying is not clear.

In bottom posting, the reply is placed below the quote of the mail to
which we are replying. This is slightly better than top posting but
the problems with bottom posting are:

1. The reply to a lengthy email could just be one small sentence at
the end. Having to scroll through the whole length of the long quote
just to read one sentence is irritating for a lot of people.
2. Also we are unnecessarily quoting a lot of text to which our reply
is not pertaining to. This leads to wasted bandwidth again.
3. Also irrespective of which part of the email we are replying to,
the reply is always below the quote, which can some times make it
ambiguous on which part of the email is the reply pertaining to.

Example of bottom posting:

No problems. 6pm it is then.

Basically, I will update our WWW server and firewall.
No, you won't have to reboot.
</snip>

In interleaved posting style, the reply is placed just below the part
of the email that we are replying to. For example if there are 3
paragraphs in the email that you are replying to and you are replying
to the 1st paragraph, the reply is placed below the 1st paragraph and
above the remaining quote. This gives a natural, conversational style
to the reply and it is easier to follow the conversation when this
style is used. There is still the problem of unnecessarily quoting the
2nd and 3rd paragraphs, even though we are not replying to them. This
again wastes bandwidth in a mailing list because irrelevant content is
unnecessarily sent to all the members of the mailing list. So the
irrelevant quoted parts are trimmed to ensure our reply contains only
our reply to the quoted parts to which we are replying to. This is the
best way of posting to mailing lists.

Example of interleaved, trimmed posting:

Subject: [Ilugc] best practices for backup and restore on upgrading
Message-ID: <1341319789.4674.12.camel@xlquest.web>

hi,

upgrading a distro is usually (for me anyway) a huge PITA. Normally one
just inserts the new dvd and clicks on upgrade. Most distros are fairly
sane nowadays, so the process is smooth. But at times it is necessary to
delete everything and do a fresh install. This means backing up data and
restoring it - restoring some configuration stuff while not restoring
others. What I do is:

1. sensitive passwords - in my memory (not on any other device)
2. firefox settings and pass words - use firefox sync
3. non sensitive passwords - save in a text file on my backup device
4. code, docs etc - mostly under version control - what is not under
version control is in specific directories that are manually backed up
5. nginx, apache and other config files - under version control.
6. evolution - use evolution backup and restore.

inspite of all this, I invariably lose data - any other tips?

thanks for the examples.

in all the three examples, we can get the message fully as we know how to
read top, bottom and middle replies.

can anyone share some links from our list archives or any other mailing
list archives, that we can not get the information due to top or bottom
posting?

i think we crossed the era of bandwidth problems in personal email systems.

i love the style of replying in the middle of the mails. but can not get
the strong reasons to ask others to avoid top and bottom posting.

as for as they reply in a style which any one can read and understand the
information, it is ok in my opinion.

thanks.

I am saying this because I am part of other mailing list as well and there
are no rules imposed there provided that they do not go out of topic.

The idea needs to be simple ask question or provide answer,  However just
to provide that if there are rules that is when it becomes really difficult
:-( especially new people to the group find it very difficult :-(

For example, in the conversation on promoting Linux, Niam Infotech top
posted a reply on top of Jobin's top post which was on top of
Kenneth's email, saying "Thanks a ton for taking this initiative.
Appreciated." There is no way to tell for sure whom the poster was
appreciating, unless he mentions it. The same applies for criticism as
well. Also removing all the context from a reply and posting the reply
alone is also considered top posting by many people. There is no way
to absolutely ascertain the target of the reply. It might be possible
to apply common sense and context to find out, but that might not be
possible always.

And while I agree that we're past the era of bandwidth issues (just my
personal opinion), why should we repeatedly archive the context in
every single mail though the mailing list already does that? We're
wasting hard disk space in addition to making the reading of emails
from the list difficult.

Just my couple of cents to this issue.

Is this your way of presenting your stand for top posting? :) Just
kidding :) . I recommend you read the legendary
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html. While I agree that
asking questions and getting answers is one of the primary uses of
mailing lists such as this, there is no obligation for any one in the
list to provide answers to questions. People participate out of their
own interest to share their wisdom and in the process help others. The
guidelines are primarily aimed at taking the best possible route to
get answers from people. Why would I be interested in answering your
questions, if you repeatedly top post and I am unable to get the
context at all or if I had to put in a lot of effort to get the
context just to help you? If you're bottom posting and your answer is
just a few words, why should I scroll down a large amount of text just
to see few words of reply that too when the context of the reply might
not be obvious.

Mostly those who try to insist on following the guidelines are trying
to educate and not to discipline. Why should some one waste time doing
that and is it too much to expect people to give themselves better
chances of getting helped?

Apologies if there is more ranting in this email than useful content.

 So, we have to request the top posters to add "Mention" for whom they
write. :-)

The new comers scare to mail to our list on the fear of
top/bottom/middle post threats.
So, some of them remove all the content and type their replies.

The gmail tricks the reader by hiding all the quoted text.
We can see that all the top/bottom posts wont give any trouble for the
gmail users.

Who uses other email systems and email clients link mutt, emacs,
thunderbird suffer from top/bottom posts.

If a person wishes to answer a question, he chooses the easiest way or
his own way to reply.
When we ask him to change the way he replies, he gets the same
thoughts on mind as

"I get little free time, I wish to make it useful for the community.
I check email and reply, if I know the answers for any queries.
If there are restrictions a.k.a guidelines on how I have to reply to a email,
I will skip replying, instead of formatting the email for better readability.

I am not getting this regulations, in office and in most of the other lists.
If there are regular inspection on how I am replying, I will be just a
reader than contributor"

----

These are the words I am hearing from many people for years.

If we are constantly regulating the writing style, I fear that we may
loss many list contributors and
useful discussions.


I think we need to do something to remove the fears of the list
members to write to list.

What should we have to do?

Moderation will just kill the list, we shouldn't even think about such a 
thing. IMO, It is no big deal if someone top posts in the mailing list 
but continuing to do so after knowing the mailing list guidelines is 
something to be frowned upon.

Sir

I am a poor Mechanical Engineer, who out of my interest is trying to serve
the Open Source Community. I neither work for a Software Company nor
learned any Software professionally.

When it comes to my work profile, I am a pure Mechanical Engineer who uses
Open Source Software for preparing some documents and making few
calculations. My programming knowledge is limited to few Macro Scripts for
automating things and few scripts in Extcalc.

One  of the means, by which I can contribute to the community is spreading
the word across the world and succeed in making a few change over to Open
Source rather than proprietary or piracy. The other one being translation.

The reason behind my too long (may be wierd) explanation is that I could
not complete your survey. Strictly speaking, I could not understand few
questions as they are beyond my understanding level.
Further, after seeing the full list of questions,  I feel that few of my
answers  are inappropriate  .

I feel that this questionnarie might be a good one for Open Source
Developer but, not so  for a normal Open Source Software *User*

Hence, I request your apology for incompletion of the quiz. I also request
you to delete my replies if they are inappropriate. I also beg your pardon
if my mail is hurting you by any means.

Afaik, ILUGC is one of the very friendly lists and people are welcome
to post. People here are willing to help and guide them in all ways
possible. But there is an issue when people turn deaf ears due to a
lot of reasons including fear, ignorance and etc. and continue doing
the same mistakes. If guidelines are confusing, questions can always
be asked to clarify. When some one takes the effort to help and guide
the poster but doesn't see any improvement, it is bad for everyone.
Everyone makes mistakes and learn through them. The idea here is to
learn.

If we are thinking of relaxing the mailing list guidelines, I am
against it, but it is just my personal opinion.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

Installing /home in a different partition than the root is helpful to some

This worked well for me too. In addition, I made sure that apps that
install are also in a non-system partition so that reinstall keeps
these apps safe and the need to re-install is less. Inspite of this,
to keep  compatibility as OS changes, I still have to install a few
core apps like mail client, monitoring utilities.

@general
This is my opinion that we are living in a age were hardisk size is not a
matter and more over we are not sending any attachments, it is just text so
I guess that it is a very least of concern.

properly. My sincere apologies. I have selected few relevant lines from 
Kenneth's post from my thunderbird and hit reply to post, am I doing

You have properly trimmed the post. But your reply should be below the

In reply to your comment, I am "top posting" here. Don't do this, read 
my other comment below.

This is bottom posting. Since, my comment is below your original text, 
it is easier for people to follow and it visually indicates that it is

Hi all.,

          I installed and configure the mail server in ubuntu 11.10 with
"POSTFIX+DOVECOT+ROUNDCUBE".

It is working fine with its functionality like send/receiving mail  but i
needed the backend interface for controlling the mail server like adding
the new mail user,mail box size controller etc.

If there is any plugin available or not. Please suggest me and i want to
make the entire system working fine with all functionalities.

                                  thanks in advance.

Friends.

As we discussed some time back, I moved our site to wordpress and
placed at http://ilugc.in

With the help of the link http://blog.room34.com/archives/4530,
I moved the content from drupal to wordpress.

I am yet to find a better theme, so stopping at pagelines.

Feel free to share your suggestions to keep the site content rich.

Thanks.

well, it has come as a top post. You need to configure thunderbird to

actually this is not bottom posting - it is interleaved posting, which
is the correct way of doing things. In bottom posting, there is no
trimming of text, and the post is usually under the sig.

Nice.

With any theme, the header image height can be reduced very much, as in
current era of widescreen laptops vertical space is to be used
intelligently. In my screen, the logo and the menu bar together occupy
almost half of the page height.

Showing the three boxes below the menu only in home page should be enough,
IMO. If you feel those things need to be visible always, it's better to put
them in sidebar.

>
> Feel free to share your suggestions to keep the site content rich.

For the content to be better visible for search engines, use appropriate
tags. For example, as far as I could see, most of the sub-headings in the
posts are simply bold text, rather than <h2>. In wordpress, you can use
Ctrl+2 to make the selected text as <h2>, Ctrl+3 for <h3>, etc.

Hi all

Recently deployed a local library repository server using CENTOS 5.2 on our intranet and also configured local DNS on the same machine. I am able to do ping, resolve through nslookup, IP, hostname etc.. But the issue is that I am unable to access through proxy server via browser settings. If I remove proxy and choose "No proxy", then I am able to access through browser on intranet. What is the technical hitch invlovled in it.? could anybody help me in resolving this issue.?

with thanks

Message-ID: <CAND2796XBGkAQtxysxXFd=W9Rw=-jJN1r4G7sX4Wd6vZZa01iw@mail.gmail.com>

We had our June 2012 meeting on  June 9.

Bala discussed about how we can control the internet traffic in a
network using squid proxy.
He demonstrated using the virtual boxed network on his laptop.

Amachu narrated on how he came to the business using Free Software.
He explained the issues he faced and how the business overcomes them.

He said that there are tons of business opportunities in the free
software world.
He called for people who can work with him on Drupal, OpenERP and
RedHat Linux Server.

Then, we had a discussion on how to conduct a public event for free software.
We got the following suggestions.

1. Go to Rich Street and discuss with the hardware vendors to host a
event for them
2. Distribute pamphlet to public describing the advantages of free softwares

3. Conduct coding competitions for students
4. Start Compass ambassadors for free software in each college and
start events through them.

Baskar, Linuxpert.in distributed Linux For You magazine for all
participants for free.

Here are some snaps.
https://picasaweb.google.com/ilugc.in/June2012Meeting

Thanks for all 18 participants and speakers.

Let us plan for the action items and execute them.

Besides guidelines in top/bottom posting, I would like to highlight the need for

1.  "quoting" only the relevant portions of the message when replying.
 It is very annoying to see +1 or a me too (at least to me) at the end
of a long quoted message.   Here the chap has followed the guideline
of bottom posting but has unnecessarily quoted the entire posting
which is anyway available in the list archives and sorted by
thread/subject.

2.  Proper attribution/quoting is also important when you **forward**
some "piece of interest" type announcements/ or discussions.

Not a link or a screen shot but here is a copy/paste of one my sig lines.

<sig>
A: Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.
Q: Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
A: Top-posting.
Q: What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?
</sig>

The above illustrates the point about how top posting can screw up a discussion.

You need to put the IP of the repository server under exceptions in
the proxy server.


sorry to say that Still it persists, the error message on the browseer as usual of the following

-------------------------------------------
Network Error (dns_unresolved_hostname)

Your requested host "eprints.ccmb.res.in" could not be resolved by DNS.

Oops, I forgot the attribution for the above.  I have seen this in

Good one. The link labelled "ILUG-C guidelines" in References (last slide)
is broken. I guess it should be http://ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines/. I
understand the pdf was prepared long back. However, we can get the odp file
from
http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/mailing-list-etiquette.odpand
update the link, as it is under GNU FDL.

There is already "Use interleaved, trimmed posting" in the guidelines. I
think "trimmed" covers your point. May be it's too subtle.

to be frank, we do not need such people on this list. This attitude is
typical of the casual, sloppy, unprofessional attitude towards work that
many people have. If you do something, take pride in doing it to the
best of your ability in an orderly and correct manner, respecting the
rules and conventions followed in the field in which you are operating.
If you cannot, do everyone a favour by going and doing something else.
Formulating a reply on a mailing list - or contributing code to a
project, or filing a bug report or anything else worth doing is worth
doing well. An example:

one fine day I had the bright idea of contributing a small feature to
the django project. I studied all the guidelines I could find, looked at
the code in similar modules, wrote up the patch, tried it out and then
posted a ticket and sat back waiting for acceptance and praise to flow
in. Some one accepted the ticket and said 'where are your tests?'. I
said 'doctests are there'. He said 'we need unit tests'. I went back,
wrote unit tests, ran them and resubmitted. Then he said - 'tests are
failing for python 2.5'. Went back, set up a virtualenv, installed 2.5
and found the problem was upstream. The guy was good enough to check the
upstream problem, and let me know when it was fixed. Tests passed - I
resubmitted. Then he asks - 'you have not added docs for the new
feature'. Went back and added docs. Resubmitted. Then he wants all the
changes in one patch. Figured out how to do that and finally, after 6
months, my 10 lines of code was accepted.

At last inpycon, I was relating my experience to a friend who is a top
class programmer and an expert in django. He said he had the same
experience and was like 'who do these guys think they are? They should
be grateful for any contribution - not nitpick on the formatting'. He
refuses to contribute. That to me sounds like the attitude of top
posters in this list. 
> 
> I am not getting this regulations, in office

office mail is totally different - most offices have the policy of
compulsory top posting and full quoting of the mail in order to keep
context.
>  and in most of the other lists.

which lists are these?
> If there are regular inspection on how I am replying, I will be just a
> reader than contributor" 

so be it - as far as I am concerned the only greater pleasure than
reading well crafted, precisely formatted replies to queries on mailing
lists is managing to write such replies.

Hi

I installed vnc4server today and started the server like

vncserver :1

when connected I got a black screen with just the terminal.

So I went inside .vnc/xstartup and uncommented the following two lines of
session_manger and X11, now even I don't even get the command prompt.  Just
a black screen.

#!/bin/sh

# Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:
unset SESSION_MANAGER
exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
xsetroot -solid grey

+1.

People who complain so should look at things from the reader's perspective.
They should think of how frustrating it would be for them to read an
ill-formatted documentation. Mailing list is no different from that -
discussions are meant to be referenced by a wider community, even more than
the subscribers of the mailing list.

I find answers to many of doubts by search results from mailing lists. When
the search results you get have unformatted, top-posted replies, many of us
would feel like "Who asked this guy to reply? He should have better kept
quiet". Exact same thing here. When you create something to be consumed by
a community, either make it as best as possible or don't do it at all.

Btw, I'm not sure if this reply of mine is at the right place. When one top

I'd say place your reply below the part you're replying to and trim the rest.

Dear Friends,

I am sorry for this mail.

I received the survey request through this list only and I feel it is
appropriate to comment on that using this list only. . I was shocked on
seeing a reply mail, insulting me.

>>Nobody is interested to know if you are poor or rich.

I feel very much insulted by this sentence.

The writer has insisted me to send my feedback to the author not to the
list. I get his point. But, I have one query.

I was not the only one who has given a feedback. There is one more feedback
to the survey request, which was posted well before my reply. But, there
was no mention on that. Does rules or advise apply only to newbies?

I strongly feel that mailing a person about one of  his/her post, who does
not have my contact, is not so ethical. Further, this is not some thing
like a service or art that requires feedback of the work. I just replied
expressing my inability to complete the surveyalong with appreciation for
his task.

I feel verymuch depressed by the reply mail, which has humiliated me.

If the members in the list feel that this list is not for one who does not
practise software profession, or if this list is something only for a group
of people, I request you to kindly relieve me from the list.

Thank you

this is due the casual attitude many of us have, even me.

While signing, they are sent the guidelines to adhere to while posting 
to the list. (if not this can be done.)

Many do not care.

Most only confirm the subscription. By choosing to join the list - they 
need to know about it.

By observing others posting to the list - they can get what it is.

This is not the case just with this list but everywhere.

At times, despite being aware of the facts - everyone of us could make 
mistakes.

So when somebody points to it, its a reminder. Nothing much to bother.

What is stopping you from making the change, and sending it to

downstream benefits from your change.

Anyways, the link has now been updated in the presentation.

If you couldn't fill the survey form, replying to the OP would have been
appropriate.

I don't see such reply in this thread. Was it sent to you alone and not to
this list?

Whatever, while taking part in such forums, you should be ready to accept
criticism and learn from it. Sometimes it might feel harsh for a newbie,
but you should get used to straight forward replies.

I'm not sure what you meant by poor. If you were talking about economical
status, definitely it's not so nice to talk about it here. Else, the reply
makes no sense. Either way, there is no insult, IMO.

Come on dude, get rid of this complaining attitude. This is a community. If
you feel something is not right, just say so. Don't humiliate yourself. If
you say something wrong, you would learn it from the replies to it. But
*learning* from the mistakes is very important.

Arun Palaniappan,
Your reply coming after my mail in the thread make it looks as if I sent
the private mail to you. If you want to complain and bring notice about a
private mail in this list, have the courage to mention the person and
contents of that mail before you reply.

I was the one who complemented you in this list by asking you to change
poor to proud. But I should add here that you need to change your victim
and complaining attitude if you want to grow.

All the best.

[To the list guideline managers] The only way I could reply to this post
was a top post. Could not find a way to do it otherwise :)

Regards,
Arun

you have not read the mail properly - the author was praising you. And
your mail was a very good and accurate one. The survey in question was
badly framed, invasive of privacy and you were right in only filling it
in partially. I hope you did not give your name and email address in the
survey.

Sir, I am not mentioning you.
I recieved a mail with ILUG-C in topic and after reading through, I just
pressed the Reply Button and replied. I was not aware of the fact that
members in the list may reply to the persons in individual also. Thanks to
Shri. T. Shrinivasan, who in a  private chat, made me understand that the
other mail was a private mail and not the one from the list.

I donot want to create unrest by mentioning the writer of the mail but, I
just post the mail content below for a further understanding.

I felt very much insulted on seeing the mail below. I accept the critisicm
of not abiding to the rules. But, I cant accept someone degrading my
profession.

Thank you,

Thank you for your reply Sir. I was not replying for  Shri. Arun
Venkataswamy. I learned later that it was a private mail which I have
explained in my earlier mail.

Yes, interleaved posting is one aspect where you rejoinder your
response to specific paras in the post.

I was pointing to people simply doing a +1 either @ the top or @ the
bottom repeating the entire message as quotes.   At times, in the
entire quote, there are different opinions on the issue and it is not
clear who you are agreeing to!
IMO one could trim the quote to points that you agree with.

Let us suppose that the office imposes certain guidelines regarding
email etiquette that are contrary to your "email habit" ;  are you
going to flout those regulations?   Probably not :)

Nobody is inspecting any one's responses, but it is exposing your
attitude that you are not willing to learn or change your habit.

My early experience in mailing lists was similar but after reading
properly formatted responses, I realized the value it added to the
discussions and changed my response style to the guide lines in place
be it office, mailing lists, or web forums.

> These are the words I am hearing from many people for years.

And perhaps for many more years because there will always be guys who
do not want to change or learn to respect the guidelines.

Writing style can vary from person to person and their command over
the language.   In the days when USENET was the place for technical
discussions, there were folks who could not write proper English but
they respected the guidelines and managed to get their point across.

> I think we need to do something to remove the fears of the list
> members to write to list.

This is the *only* list where I read that people are fearful to post.
Who are these people and what exactly are they afraid of?

If their fear is centered around breaking the guidelines (inspite of
so many helpful links being given every time this topic comes up) then
I would say they are afraid of speaking in *any* public forum not just
mailing lists.  IMO, they need to enroll themselves into public
speaking workshops to overcome this fear.

No Pain, No Gain.

> What should we have to do?

We go through this discussion about every six months :)   For people
to have a meaningful experience, they must realize they need to follow
the guidelines.  Otherwise they are sending the wrong message "The
guidelines are for the general public, I am special (aka very busy
person) and it does not apply to me"

IMO, such people are looking for a one way change, you accept my way
of working - never mind that I agreed to the guidelines when I
subscribed to the list.

IMO, this is a manifestation of a general attitude, of the public at
large and you can see it everywhere (not just mailing lists), for
example:

People jump the queues.
People jump the red signal @ intersections and curse at the driver who
has the right of way!
People in the local train, quite far away from the office but telling
their boss they will be in the office within 5 mins.
The "B.E." degree holder expects to be given a step by step
instructions to do the job
... You can add your anecdotes here ...

My 10 paise.

See the discussions in the CentOS general mailing list
<http://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos/>

Debian list <http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/> where majority
follow the mailing list etiquette.

List members in above are as busy as most members here, some are
senior admins at their respective job places or consulting practices
and yet they do *find* the to follow mailing list etiquette and
format/trim their responses.

Hopefully, the above examples drive home the point about the value of
following mailing list guidelines.

Is it wifi or wired?

1. Always prefer storing username/password in router settings. In this 
way other people can also use interet at your place/office.

goto http://192.168.1.1
username - admin
password - admin / password (just use one of these)

2. If wifi and you have broadcom chipset then Ubuntu 12.04 has a bug for 
these chipsets. Run following commands everytime you log in then you 
will be able to connect through wifi.

terminal> sudo modprobe -r b43 ssb wl
terminal> sudo modprobe wl

I would recommend creating bash script for these.

3. Ubuntu 12.04 supports mostly all ethernet chipsets. Just after 
following first step plug in the cable and net will work.

NOTE:- Above are generic instructions. Without hardware/connection 
details I can't provide much help.

Which modem/router? Brand, model number etc. In windows ISP usually 
install their own programs to help user install internet BUT in Ubuntu 
or GNU/Linux user has to do this manually.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and all my username/password, IP addresses, 
Gateway, DNS settings are saved in router (provided by ISP) itself. So 
in order to access Internet what I have to do is just plug in network cable.

Mailing lists have a message digest notification mode to its
subscribers (for those who do not want individual emails). Thankfully
not on this list but elsewhere, I receive replies by subscribers to
the digest.

Two issues with this:
a) the whole digest gets quoted which is absurb.
b) I need to figure out to which specific message the subscriber is
replying or giving his views on.

Amongst mailing list evils, this is the most evil, IMHO.

You just misunderstood it. Please don't write/give your personal info
or status on public mailing lists. Be conscious of what you submit to
surveys or third-party websites. It is the same mistake that people
make by giving their passwords away to social networking websites.

Please don't take things personal. If you do, the public mailing list
shouldn't be used for personal discussions. Private discussions have
to be kept private. By making private discussions public, you lose
people's trust in trying to help you in private (so as to not hurt
your image in public). At the end of the day, if you follow advice,
you benefit. We have nothing to lose.

When a discussion goes like this, you have to remove all the old
discussions, if you want to add content.
quoting all the previous discussions is called over quoting.

Just imagine, how it will look, in the previous example, all the
content are huge paragraphs instead of single lines.

So, trimming all the unwanted content is always good.

Over-quoting includes nesting of previous replies identified by '>':

>>>
>>
>

For example:

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2005-October/021290.html

The following is an example of a reply to a digest where the user has
top-posted, and forgotten to remove the irrelevant text:

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2005-October/021243.html

So, one hopes to see some text at the bottom, and scrolls all the way
down to the end of the message only to realize that the user has
top-posted.

The following is an example of a reply to a digest where the user has
bottom-posted, and forgotten to keep only the relevant text:

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2005-November/022002.html

In both cases, the subject lines haven't been changed, and there is a
trail of messages that are irrelevant.

RoundCube is just a web mail client, created for sending/reading
emails using a web interface.

It is not a email server admin software.

You have to do all the admin tasks inside the server manually, or try
the web based server management tools as "webmin"

Found the solution as to why VNC was not showing up because in the
~/.vnc/xstartup file sh word was missing in the line exec
/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

I will try freenx-server as well in the near future,  it is always good to
know the workaround :-) thanks Rajagopal.

Correct.

Roundcube uses SMTP and IMAP in the backend.

So if you simply add a real user using useradd or adduser roundcube
will start recognizing.

In case you are using virtual users then you can use the appropriate tool.

But I think even virtual users are mapped to real UNIX accounts with
/bin/false as the shell
 or something.

That is what I do in my mail server.

Roundcube is a brilliant tool, I am happy you are using it.

Create folders, preview pane, HTML mail inline display and so on.

People get an Outlook like experience on the web.

At least my customer is very happy with it.

a lot of these so-called phd/research surveys are by spammers who want

I found out the source of the problem, it was the proprietary nvidia

Above line tells it all. After installing dpkg tries to configure ssmtp. Here it fails, probably unable to get hostname

run the command  'hostname' in the terminal and share us the output.

If it returns nothing, setup a hostname for your machine and install
the software again.

My suggestions:
1. Limit the no of entries to 5 in the 1st page OR limit the
characters per entry.
2. Put "join the list" at the end of List Guide line page. Otherwise,
we may get emails like, "plz remove my email id.."
3. Fix the blog tags (Announcements, Event, MoM, fdp, workshop, ..).
Otherwise we will end up with 100s of tags.

YOU Broadband must have given you a "device" which has two ports.

At the least, you must provide what your YOU device look like.

1. One port terminates the cable coming from YOU and another port must
an ethernet RJ45 port which connects to your desktop with an CAT 5/6
ethernet cable.   A snapshot of the same posted on
<http://imagebin.com> will help a lot to confirm what you are dealing
with.

2. For MS Windows they must have given you a PPoE client.   A
screenshot of the Windows UI  posted on imagebin.com would also help.

3. With the above information from the Windows client, you can
configure the same from the NetworkManager UI under DSL click on "Add"
and you will get another UI window with several tabs.  Main tab has
the userid/password which would be the same as that in Windows.  Under
PPP tab you will have to select the items that are enabled in your
Windows client.  This is for KDE.  In GNOME NetworkManager applet
things may be laid a bit differently.

You may have to experiment with a few settings before you can
successfully connect.   I leave that as an exercise for you to learn
networking skills.

IMO, The article was more about Apple and its IP policy in general. The 
comments sections in the article throw more light on this. Although an 
interesting read, I thought it was OT. I could be wrong.

Please blog this or contrib as HowTo.   Mention all the *gotchas* as
well and  mention the distro+version as package names can be different
across distros.

depends on the definition OT for this group. The group is not a
homogeneous group with a single well defined aim. It is a loose alliance
of several different types of focus. I see it like this:

1. It is a linux users' group - so obviously any discussion of linux and
linux based stuff is not OT.

2. We have a large number of adherents to the Free Software movement, so
any discussion of this - including discussions of the wider concerns of
the Free Software Movement like DRM etc is not OT.

3. We also have a large number of Open Source enthusiasts - so
discussion of these topics, including the ongoing debate between open
source and free software is also on topic.

4. In addition we have users of various BSD and unix flavours.

5. As a consequence of the above, discussion of any open source
language, toolkit and framework is also ok.

6. And advocacy of all the above also implies that criticism of
companies and ideas that are contrary to the above is also on topic.

I would say that the post under consideration falls fairly under points
2 and 6 above and is not OT.

I agree with you that the above mentioned points are relevant to the 
list in some way, but where do we draw the line ? I am sure, there are 
going to a bunch of news articles every day on DRM, patents, copyright 
etc. For example, the recent controversy over Blizzard and Diablo III on 
GNU/Linux (over wine),

http://www.gamepolitics.com/2012/07/03/updated-diablo-iii-linux-users-banned-blizzard-using-wine

Because, GNU/Linux users are affected, one can claim it to be relevant 
to the list but I just consider it to be news and would add an [OT] tag.

IMO, The reason for [OT] tag is to help members in the list to skip 
emails of least importance/relevance and to enable discussions which are 
subjective without any end goal.

Just my 2 cents.

Really? It seems to be working fine for me.

Unless you are on MS Windows, it is most likely due to your DNS server. 
You should check/change your DNS server settings.

Try the following link which uses the IP directly,

http://174.143.7.233/2012/07/03/updated-diablo-iii-linux-users-banned-blizzard-using-wine

In the above link it is mentioned, " If malware detected, Windows users
must update their Anti-virus and Microsoft Essentials, Mac users got a tool
".

What is the state of GNU/Linux ? Does it mean we need not worry about it?

DNS Changer malware made news for infecting Windows machines,  However it
is worth a check even on GNU/Linux if you DNS requesting is getting
resolved in the correct DNS server :-)

How would one go about doing it on a GNU/Linux desktop?  An example
would have helped.

I don't have a working example.  However my doubt is what if my ISP is
infected with DNS changer even when my GNU/LINUX is not.

The URL must be
http://www.ubuntu.com/tour/en/<http://www.ubuntu.com/tour/en/*>

' * ' appended makes it invalid. And this Online Tour is active since
Ubuntu 11.04 or 11.10 (am not sure about which version it is).

[OT] is not meant for discussion on things directly related to Free
s/w or Open Source philosophy.
This particular article is further concerned with h/w that may be used
with GNU/Linux.
For your requirements....
Maybe we can have more descriptive tags like

[A] : advocacy
[T]: Technical
[P]: Free s/w Philosophy (for real articles on free s/w philosophy)

(improve this )

The advantage with this test is that though you PC may not be infected we
can help our ISP solve the problem which they have not noticed yet.  I
heard that there are still around 50K PC around the world infected with
this malware.

Interesting link.
For me personally it's a love-hate interest towards Apple.

Love their art. Hate their control.
Greatest industrial engineering company ever.

BTW, their new mac book pros with retina display feature even more
`physical` control:

   - The infamous pentalobe case screws which are tamper proof. No one will
   sell you the screw driver for this.
   - Batteries are glued to case, you can't change them.
   - RAM is soldered to the motherboard. You cant change them.

Still, can't avoid putting it into my wishlist :)

Arun

my reinstallation went well - did not lose any data or valuable
information. One hiccup - firefox sync did not work as I had omitted to
pair my old installation so did not have the key to open with my new
install. But I just copied my old .mozilla directory to the new install
and got all my passwords and bookmarks. So now I am on Fedora 17 - as
usual everything worked out of the box except mobile broadband which has
never worked since fedora 12. I have decided to give up on that and make
my laptop dual boot - and I am going to try this out:

Most times their tech support is clueless about basic networking
issues.   When I tell them that I cannot ping their GW IP on the far
side of my DSL connection (the end point of the first hop), the chaps
insist that I ping some other IP number which is beyond their own
gateway!

Expecting them to understand DNS poisoning - you are a brave man.

Personally, I use my own DNS server (bind) built into the gateway.

I am also on Fedora 12 and looking for an upgrade. I have tried Fedora 
17 and couldn't get beyond the Gnome 3 madness, did you get your Gnome 3 
to work to your liking ?

no - it is an idiotic interface, but have got used to it. The worst
thing about it is that one cannot open multiple copies of the same
program. Sometimes when programming, I like to have one copy of my
editor open with one file on one monitor and another copy of the editor
open with another file on the other monitor. And I am used to having
icons for all my open programs neatly lined up along the bottom of my
screen, and clicking the one I want. Now I have to keep banging on the
top right of my screen with the mouse to do that ...

Please explain more on this I did not understand.  My idea about DNS server
is that if your local DNS server does not have an IP corresponding to a
domain name or if its cache does not have one it will look up the next
level DNS server's what ever you have configured to see if that has an
answer.  If at all you have configured your ISP's DNS server as the next
level DNS server and if your ISP is ignorant about DNS changer malware we
will at least know to skip using the ISP's DNS server by starting to use
open DNS.

install powerdns for example - tell it to run on 127.0.0.1. Configure
your network to use the nameserver on 127.0.0.1. Done. Goodbye to your
ISP's nameserver. Even simpler is to set your nameserver to the opendns
IPs - 208.67.220.220 and 208.67.222.222. I have been using vsnl/bsnl
since 1995 and I can assure you their dns sucks bigtime. I used my local
nameserver till about 2006 when I became aware of opendns.

The "root" DNS servers provide the NS for the TLD and the first level
sub domains under each TLD.
If a domain name is not cached then the NS records are fetched
starting @ the "root" servers.   The file "root.hint" in bind
installation is the provide the IP numbers for the "root" servers.

Read up on how DNS works - really if you are serious about it.  There
are a couple of informative O'Reilly books on the subject.  Although,
for starters you can start here <http://www.tldp.org> and browse
through the HowTos index.

Okay I did not know that it comes with a preloaded set of IP addresses.

I just downloaded root.zone to find out the same :-)
$ cat root.zone | grep

	Kavaraipettai
Message-ID: <CACtiFJbG7AhmccF+9hi3PK00sTbVr1v=CXNJ_oAi5pfF5eO+tA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

One day FOSS workshop was conducted in Sri Durgadevi Polytechnic College,
Kavaraipettai (http://www.sdpc.ac.in) on 06/07/12 for the 2nd and 3rd year
students of Computer Technology totaling 126 students.

The workshop was conducted as 2 separate sessions.  A hands-on session was
given to all the students to remotely install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in their
desktops.  After installation the students were introduced to package
management using apt-get / ubuntu software center. An interesting thing to
note that, more than 30 students purchased Ubuntu DVDs after the workshop.

I would like to thank Mr. Harikumar / Placement Officer and HOD/Computer
Technology for organising the workshop.

Also, in my recent workshops, I noticed ubuntu's default unity interface
attracts students community at large.

Now I am currently working on a new project named, "Ubuntu Linux Campus" to
implement Ubuntu GNU/Linux in more than 2000+ technical institutions across
Tamilnadu (only the project is named after Ubuntu, and we will be
supporting all other major distributions as well, so no distro
controversies here).

I am sure that this initiative would definitely become huge success if it
is well planned / supported.  I am very eager to hear from ILUG-C / other
community members on this.

Regards

S. Baskar
CEO/LinuXpert Systems

Subject: [Ilugc] mplayer tricks
Message-ID: <CALDskyymaYBDgysL2yRW6qBc8xj+Vwrw+XZOzHhs1E2HWTqM+w@mail.gmail.com>

There are plenty of music players and video players in UNIX.

But I love mplayer. I have also done some foot pedal coding with mplayer I/O.

But overall I love it for its ability to handle all media,all
situations and all output devices.

I got to know that mplayer is actually a music player as well from my
former colleague several
 years ago.

You could play video in root window(yes), you could also play tv and
do several other things.

$ mplayer -rootwin foo.flv

You can also play streaming audio and video.From Internet radio
stations or a video file available
 using HTTP or RTSP.

Actually you could also use it to view webcam and surveillance camera.

mplayer also can rip DVDs, play DVDs.

You can transcode video using its companion mencoder. You can create a
DVD from a bunch of
 video files.

You need dvdauthor after converting the video to mpeg.

mplayer can play a song or a playlist in a loop. It also understands
playlists, it has support for OSD menus.

Which is basically transparent glass like menus invoked with the mouse
or keyboard.

Enough?

Really? In Unity, at least you can open many instances but switching
between the windows is little tricky. When the currently focused window is
of program A and you want to switch to one of the many windows of program
B, clicking the B's icon in the left panel (or using Alt+Tab to traverse to
program B) will open the last accessed window of the program. Clicking the
icon again will show a tiled view of all the windows of the program and you
can click on the one you want. Using Alt+Tab to access the window that was
not used last is more painful. You need to traverse to the app using
Alt+Tab and press down arrow still holding the Alt key (or keep holding Alt
key for few seconds) to get the tiled view of the open windows.

May be Gnome 3 also has some similar ways, explore :)

And I am used to having

I'm used to Alt+Tab even before Unity and Gnome3 came and I find it much
easier. I was thinking that most of the programmers or anyone who uses
keyboard more use Alt+Tab rather than clicking.

If you are installing using the package manager or using a deb file,
you can use dpkg -L <package name> to see the list of files installed
by the package and their location. If you already have the binary in
your path and are able to run the command but want to know the
location of the binary, you can use 'which' command to find out.

If you have installed the application by other means and know the name
of the binary/configuration file you can use find command to find the
same.

> feel hard to find drivers to connect java with database.

Which database do you want to connect to? For MySQL, there is the
"libmysql-java" package that installs the JDBC driver for connecting
to MySQL.

P.S. Do not top-post while posting to this list. Interleaved, trimmed
posting is the recommended style of posting. If you want to learn
about the various posting style, their merits and de-merits, read the
mailing list guidelines available at
http://ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines/

Did you search the web for the same? I used the keywords "svn gui
tool" and was able to find relevant links immediately. Avoid posting
to the list without doing any research. RabbitVCS (as somebody already
pointed out) and TortoiseSVN are very popular tools. TortoiseSVN is
not available for GNU/Linux and RabbitVCS is not available in packaged
form for non-GNU/Linux operating systems.

Thanks & Regards,

      I don't know how Uber SVN works. But on Ubuntu, just do

sudo apt-get install subversion

And you will have your subversion ready. Then, if you want to create a
new repo on the box, use

svnadmin create repo_name

Then you need to import the necessary data using svn import. If you
want to access your repo over HTTP/HTTPS, you need to add the WebDAV
for svn and configure apache(or  what ever server you prefer to use).

If you just want to use it to check out a copy, after install
subversion, just do

svn co https://url/of/repo dest_folder

dest_folder is optional there.

You can do commit, update, resolve conflicts etc using the respective
commands. Thanks


PS: Please do not top post. There have been numerous discussion on the
list asking people not to top post just last week :)

      For a detailed reply, please read the wiki page on posting
styles[1]. For a short answer, when you reply to an email, if you
typing your reply above the email to which you are replying, you are
top posting. The correct way to post is Interleaved posting, with
proper trimming. This thread, [2] and this message[3]  in particula
explains what to do and why top/bottom posting is a problem. Thanks

Message-ID: <CANc+2y60j+fNjoi6atMmyFF9koYmenHApywSUr6k3Hk-Qs32sg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have created an application using Qt framework for ubuntu app
showdown. I have hosted it in
https://launchpad.net/share-ubuntu-updates. Please let me know how to
package it (creating a .deb file). I am very new to creating deb so I
don't have much idea on it. Tomorrow is the last date for creating the
PPA for the application (which needs the .deb). Thanks in advance for
the help.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <CAH+XRMhtv_btqqz25cGgnDYNeL2rUmp9gCohvte=U5C5xLdMDQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

  I  am  using Win  Xp in  my  system with 4 partitions(C,D,E,F). I  have
installed Ubuntu 11.04 as  Dual boot in a  Partition(let it be F).
While  installing the Used and  Free  space is  shrinked in  that
partition.Now  the problem :
           "Inside Ubuntu , the root directories is loaded in  free space
 after shrinking F disk .
            The  Used  space is separated as   new File System and  mounted
in media folder.
             This  contains  lost+found folder only.
              Kindly tell me  steps to   recover data  from it.
             This  disk  is  not  shown in  windows Xp. "

Please answer my doubt..
Suppose your PC do not have any OS installed.(It has bootstrap loader).
Then,
1.  What will happen as an when you turn ON the system? Will it display
anything?
2.  How to print a hello on monitor without any OS?
3. How to use computer or operate anything without any OS? If no OS is
there, then what does it use for user interface?

What is the case for above questions when there is no bootstrap loader also.

These sound like test questions.

If you have done your microprocessor studies properly, you can figure
out what a CPU does on reset/power on.

Have you heard of BIOS?

Yes I have heard. BIOS provides Power-on-self-test and basic menu like UI
that help dealing hardware,system time settings,etc. But how to diplay a
"hello" using BIOS?

In case of X86,
The bootstrap loader will load whatever is there in the first sector  of
HDD, or Floppy or USB drive (based on the order in which it will boot up)
And verify for a signature if a valid bootloader is present. if present it
loads the bootloader and pass the control to it.

This one http://www.osdever.net/  has plenty of information about
bootloader, kernel, etc for OS development.

Hope that helps.

One event that comes to my mind...

Am thinking we should encourage businesses to bring their boxes, install
linux for them on their boxes. This can be coordinated by companies that
provide open-source tools support - they can also market their solutions
during this event.

I understand that something similar was done by the SFO lug group in their
earlier days.

Hi

I know how to mount a remote share on a GNU\Linux system for eg in Ubuntu I
click on Places > Connect to Server..... > Under sevice type selected
Windows share and gave appropriate name for the same and clicked on Connect.

Now I am able to see the remote share on my desktop however when I open my
Bash and navigate to both /mnt and /media it is not located there.  Where
would the default network share get mounted up so that I can browse the
contents using my Bash shell ?

I wish I were a part of it. I am in Mumbai <Sigh>

I would like to make a slightly modified suggestion.

One can ask the businesses bring their problems/issues/requirements.

Promoting open source software won't hurt in that case...

Products like alfresco (as a replacement to file share), Jasper
reports/perntaho for CA openvista for heathcare vertical etc come to
mind. Perhaps a demo setup with heterogenous (but staunchly FLOSS in
the backend/infra) with fixed/mobile clients/frontends would impress
more.

Subject: [Ilugc] Ubuntu Release Paryy and FOSS Classes
Message-ID: <CANyA=jzX9dEsmxVwZ5NkzQJEX4eDm+BkSs=VaeKMHDR0N6nEOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear ILUGC members,

An Ubuntu release party and the Introduction to FOSS classes to be
held in our college,MIT on Saturday, 21st July from 1pm to 4pm.
The agenda of the day:
Inspirational talk on FOSS by Mr.Ramadoss of Yavarukkumana Software foundation
A talk about Features on Ubuntu by Mr.Shrinivasan of ILUGC
Release of Ubuntu 12.04.
Installation Demo.
Introduction to FOSS Classes.

The FOSS classes to be conducted by Mr.Ramadoss are to continue
throughout, every month on the third  Saturday from 4 to 5 pm. It will
involve a 20 minute session of brainstorming wherein they will share
their experiences. The highlight of these classes is that the students
are mentored to do projects on various areas in FOSS, with a chance to
release an Open source application, certificates and internship at his
organization.

We hope this initiative is succesful and it is well received. We are
looking forward to hear from you.

Thank you.

With regards,
Team CSMIT.

Mr. Chidambaresan and Mr. Sreenivasan,

I am interested in contributing towards some expenses of this event. We 
manufacture Ubuntu powered laptops and desktops. The products will be 
available near October 2012. Please have a look at 
http://www.niamcomputech.com or 
http://news.efytimes.com/e1/86421/Now-An-Indian-Company-Launches-Ubuntu-Laptops 
for further details.

I would like to raise one issue - Businesses are too busy to bring boxes 
to a conference BUT yes we can use readymade boxes and install open 
source software on these boxes to market FOSS.

Hey, Awesome guys - I guess the next step is to meet someplace and take
this forward.

We can use my office at Chetpet for meeting. I can arrange for coffee,
biscuits/snacks.

Lets say we meet on Saturday, July 14 at 4pm. Whos in?

(We could decide on the date/venue based on the majority's preference. Just
offering one for starters.)

Regards,
M

I am in Bangalore but I am visiting Chennai sometime next week; schedule

did you try mount?   It should show all mounted devices "local" and

Message-ID: <CAFe1oo+Mo5cR8a1cnnQETMQ2+t2fmynpK+Jq8-CfYegfixKiTQ@mail.gmail.com>

The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 space crafts are nearing interstellar space and
can enter the realm between the stars any time now. They are around 15
billion kms from earth now. Both of them carry  a gold LP record
(gramophone record). The record contains sounds from the planet earth.
Sounds of the earth, greetings in a host of languages and popular songs
from around the world. This was added to the payload of the spacecrafts
just in case intelligent life in the universe stumbles upon our space
craft. From these gramophone records they will come to know about
it's origins and get an small piece of the culture of the human race. Carl
Sagan who was instrumental in this effort had to meet quite a few of bosses
of the music industry to get copyright releases signed so that the music
which they `owned` could be put on that greatest adventure mankind has ever
taken up.

On a lighter note, I was reminded about the way in which the book
`hitchhiker's guide to the universe` begins. A guy is protesting
the demolition of his house to make way for a highway to connect two
cities. The same afternoon his house is demolished, Earth gets a notice
that it's inhabitants should move as Earth was going to be demolished to
make way for an inter galactic highway!

Are copyrights valid outside earth? Anybody can enlighten?

Arun

"I wish bloggers would stop quoting that fractal article. At least 50%
of what's written in there is totally wrong/false. Other information
is terribly out of date. And even more information is merely
half-truths and lack of understanding of the language. The article
author clearly scanned through PHP bashing articles and took material
from them verbatim; mistakes and all.

I'm not going to argue that PHP is a great language, but the article
is a complete disservice to anyone who has bothered to read it. I'm
disappointed, but not surprised, that Jeff Atwood linked to it."

I don't know how reliable the above quoted news URL is, but there are
quite a few facts in the article linked to by Kenneth. As of 5.2, PHP
still has a few annoying behaviour, which would look extremely weird
to someone new to the language. Just that the author has exaggerated
few of the issues.

           I have been using PHP for 6+ years. They have ironed out a
few things now, and things are certainly improving. And to this date,
there are millions of sites that run php. But things have been really
bad in the past. Thanks


PS: IIRC, Kenneth is himself hates php very much. So.... :)

Hi all,

        I am trying a small app in django . I started to create one

test using the command  python manage.py test applicationname. when i given

manage.py test applicationname.classname.methodname*, test actually started
to run . saying 1 test run in 0.02 sec *.  what is the problem here .

I am searching for knowledge base links for how to implement the mail

if there is a step by step guidelines.

Thanks in advance.

Please see tldp.org for howtos on various topics. You'll see mail
server set up too. Follow it and if you do run into problems, I'm
certain help will be forthcoming.

1) Find out MX record and point to your public IP and do port
forwarding in your NAT box
2) Setup domain in /etc/postfix/main.cf
3) Check reverse DNS(PTR record)
4) Install dovecot and check user login using nc (IMAP and POP3)
5) install roundcube for webmail
6) Do relaying controls by allowing mail sending to only your domain
7) Define my_networks parameter to match your local n/w
8) Tweak master.cf for enabling submission port
9) Check the log file /var/log/maillog and see if it says "removed" ;)
10) Find out whether any firewall is blocking ports, normally ISPs
block outgoing 25


Finally pray to God that all works the way you want since without
God's grace it
 is impossible to get it all right in the first attempt.

It is also God's grace that you don't succeed in first attempt. ;)

Best of luck.

If something does not work, don't bank on God alone, do google, get back to
the list with  the problem,post it to various related forums, seek irc
advice.

actually I do not hate php - I hate java. But I feel that php is an
entry level language (and does a great job in bringing people to open
source), but I feel that people should move on to 'better' things, and
am continually disappointed to see talented youngsters getting afraid of
the learning curve of the 'better' things and reverting.

Hi,

I am doing Linux BMR . I need to handle the LVMs for that case. While
backing up i need to backup the "Volume group names" using pvscan in system
command and  "Logical Volume names" using lvscan  and keep it in a file..
Now i use vgdisplay command to know whether the source disk is lvm.. If its
output is "No volume groups found" i will take it as not an lvm disk.. I
need to know whether this a rite way to backup lv names and vg names.. or
if there is any better way to do it , kindly suggest me.

While i use vgdisplay and execute in system command in C side , i get some
list of files with a message that those files are getting leaked on
invocation of vgdisplay. I am confused why it is so.. Kindly tel your
suggestions..


Thanks

Hi,

    I am Naveen, Linux beginner.  Planning to certify RHEL certification.
Trying to study on my own with a mentor helping me freely in his spare
time, but he doesn?t know Linux and directed me this mailing list. Thanks
in Advance.

I have few questions here, please help me.

1)      I am trying exercise about  ?how to boot the system in Single user
mode on Centos' 6.0'?.  I am using Acer Extensa 4620 laptop Intel(R)
Core(TM)2 Duo CPU T550 @ 1.83GHZ.  I referred many webites, But  I couldn?t
find clearly about how to boot  it using single user mode on Centos.
Please help me.

2)      Why do I need to practice using CentOS instead of RHEL?

3)      Can I find list of exercises required to practices RHEL
certification exam?

GNU/Linux can be run in various modes termed as "runlevels".

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runlevel#Linux

"single user mode" is runlevel 1. To change run levels, we use the 
command "init". For example, to change to runlevel 1, run the following 
from command prompt (as root).

   init 1

To boot into run level 1, you need to modify your "kernel" line in grub 
configuration. Just add "1" anywhere in the "kernel" line and you will 
boot into single user mode.

CentOS and RHEL contain same packages but RHEL is a paid version for 
which you get commercial support. With CentOS, you get community support.

No problem.

It is always useful to find people who know Linux. If your mentor does not know
 it should not be too hard to find some young kid who knows Linux. Keep looking.

I am OpenBSD guy.

boot> boot -s

will take you to single user mode.

In Linux how to do it, just Google. it. ;)

If your filesystem is broken or something automatically you will be taken to
 single user mode.

It is like the time you get an unexpected result in the lab when you were doing
 something else.

Single user mode has the following characteristics:

1) No file systems are mounted(only ramdisk and kernel is loaded)

2) No daemons are running, which means no ssh, no remote access

3) No processes are running that have various side effects that are
 difficult to determine. Usually processes require file systems to be mounted.

4) Single user mode is usually used for taking dump/restore of file systems, to
 change root password or to just do file system checks.

Good question. You have to find the answer. Learn both, use what you like.

Also look at Debian. That is the Linux I use.

What do you plan to achieve by certifying Redhat?

It is already a 1 billion dollar company...

Okay just pulling your leg.

Relax.

Questions about certification are not discussed here normally.

If you want to get a certificate there are easier ways.

If you want to learn and enjoy life there are slower and more
 meaningful ways that give you better benefits in the long run.

Best of luck and welcome to LUG.

Adios,
Girish

Generally speaking, asking for step by step instructions in any
mailing list suggests  that you have not your own due diligence to
search (at least in my mind).

Today there are hundreds of sites on the subject matter with step by
step details.

Search key words "linux how to setup email server" in your favorite
search engine.

When you encounter problems, come with specifics to this mailing list
and I am sure collectively we can help you resolve.

For starters:

0. Be ready to read (a lot) and experiment.  With this method you will
learn IMO, if you are *serious* about sys admin; in this case email
server

1. you need to know a few details about DNS like MX records besides
the config details for the mail server.  Note that some email server
package will provide SMTP service only e.g. postfix (which BTW comes
with excellent documentation)

2. For POP3/IMAP you may have to install yet another package e.g.
dovecot (the entire .conf file is well commented for what each setting
does).

To start learning the easy way try Zimbra CE for CentOS 6.   It comes
with a shell script where you have to answer a few questions and does
the configuration setup.

HTH,

OP mentions he is searching for, but may be couldn't get closer 
results.

IMHO, everyday new people join the list & many might not know about 
search engines, even if they know they aren't aware of the right ways to 
search with proper keywords.

some one following the list for, say a month, would automatically come 
to know, the first option is duckduckgo. ;-)

but till then, when its the first time & if we reply to them to search 
first & then ask here, it might not encourage to ask further.

probably showing some pointers & then asking them to search further 
would show them the path. eventually they might end up doing it as a 
habit.

this will be repeated thousand times & the solution need also be 
repeated that much times.

PS: I noticed you giving pointers as part of the mail, but at times 
this is also conveyed rude.

OK, then that should be shared by the OP to show what s/he has come up
with so far.   We can then collectively point him/her in the right
direction.

Given the popularity of  FB and twitter amongst the cross section of
the non techy populace,  it is very unlikely that netizens have not
heard of search engines.

I agree they might not know what key words to give;  if you notice, I
have also suggested the keywords in my response.

A search on those keywords would have given the OP a whole bunch of
links that discuss email server setups.  Personally, I try to help
when I see that the other person has made some genuine efforts to help
themselves.

Or some other engine :)

IMO, this was acceptable in the 1995 to 2000s era; the web forums and
blogging was nascent and search engine archives were building up.    I
 also get personal emails seeking help.   I politely tell them to ask
their question in the forum/mailing list.  I answer if they do
otherwise I ignore them.

*Today*, for practically every problem that I have encountered; I have
found the solution or accepted it as known bug when I have simply
searched giving the error message string.

I gave the pointer to Zimbra CE.  Myself and other responders also
hinted what else the OP has to know to setup up a proper email server.

> repeated that much times.

sigh.  then the n00bs of the yester months/years, who now have a bit
more experience, should step in and start answering such questions.
Others can correct if there is any mistake in the answers.    I do not
see this happening. That is the way of learning anything.

IMO asking for step-by-step instructions is like saying "hold my hands
and tell me exactly what to do."

> PS: I noticed you giving pointers as part of the mail, but at times

sigh.

OK, so giving pointers (help) can now be considered rude.    From my
perspective, this may discourage the experienced users from giving
pointer(s).

Thanks for the feedback.

Search engine usage is a basic skill. I do not think we would coach a
person on this. OP should have told what he searched for and what he
saw as results atleast. Else it seems like "if you want something
without doing any work, ask ilugc. Easy way out".

> but till then, when its the first time & if we reply to them to search
> first & then ask here, it might not encourage to ask further.

Disagree. While we are willing to help folks, they must have the
initiative to put in some effort. If he then faces problems, I'm sure
many of us will jump in. If he does in the basic effort, then he
should not be spoon fed. IMHO, help being free and voluntary, this
much of interest is deemed necessary from the OP. I also think
teaching people to help themselves and in the bargain, help others is
one of the intended side objectives. Else, this becomes a school.

Disagree again. If a person knows he can get help on a mailing list,
it is expected that a large probability exists that some one else
would have asked the same question. So, onus is on the person to
search the mail archives.

> PS: I noticed you giving pointers as part of the mail, but at times

Opinions vary. I've not found Arun's replies rude ever. Being to the
point should not be misconstrued to be rude. Rude is when we call the
person names, attach negative connotation objectives etc. or insult
the person by being sarcastic.

being brief is in some cultures interpreted as rude - n00bs will just
have to get used to it.

Sorry, I wasn't of the opinion that Arun's reply is rude.

At times, in general when some one asks & the other replies to search 
before ask, it appears rude. - That was my opinion.

hi,

I have fedora on my system with the following partitions: /, /home, /var
and swap. Also some free space. I wanted to install another distro in
the free space. First I tried with mint - it said that no preexisting
installation exists and wanted to format the disk afresh. Next I tried
with Mandriva - this recognised the existing partitions, but I could not
find any option to make it install in the free space. Any one has some
experience in this?

First, partition your hard disk with your existing system. Crate the necessary file systems. Then, boot with the Mint CD or DVD and you should be able to complete the installation.

does linux mint have advanced mode/ text mode installation?
that would give much more options for installation.

It looks like you have allocated the entire disk space as various
partitions. I guess by free space, you mean one of the partitions is empty
or un formatted. Try deleting the partition which has the free space. Make
it un allocated disk space. Then mint might recognize this.

this is my current partition - when I tried the dual boot, I had 40 GB
of free space also.

I have not come across your requirement. To my understanding with study to
the url it requires LVM for dual booting.

I guess Mint installer is looking for a partition w/o any filesystem
on it.  Your /dev/sda5 has an ext4.

You can "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda5 count=2048" this will blow away
the first 2048 bytes on /dev/sda5 blowing away some of the filesystem
data.

Alternately, like it's upstream installer (Ubuntu), there ought to be
either a "Manual" or an "Expert" mode on the disk partition page
wherein you can select /dev/sda5 for the "/" partition.

As mentioned in your initial post, you already have 4 partitions  /, /var,
/home, swap and one extended partition (sda4).  From the above output, it
looks clear that there is no additional free space available to install a
dual distro.

Better post the content of 'fstab' here to know the mount points and its
filesystems.

if what I have been following is right, ubiquity will come into picture 
with live cd installer, debian-installer will come into picture in the 
text mode with lot more options.

ubiquity has a bug. d-i may not have it.

also, ubiquity makes installation easy with windows as the other 
operating system - extracting free space from a drive.

other os might not have got that much importance - your case fedora & 
hence ignored.

it doesn't matter much for d-i as to which os is there already in it, it 
just throws you partitions & the rest is in your hand.

You may want to try Lubi. I haven't tried it yet, believe it is something
like Wubi, installing the os like an app.

~ 1713 X 512 = 877056 bytes = 856.5 k bytes free space?

Or did I get you wrong? Are you telling that sda5 did not exist  before the
attempt to install Mint?

Greetings,

Scenario:
I have scanned a book in a4 size (set-1 of files)
I have scanned separately other sizes -- say a3 and a1 (typical
foldouts in a book) (set-2 of files)

Now I want to make a single file containing all the pages in set-1 and set-2

Is there software to do that.

I know Acrobat does it. I dont want it.

I am flexible about file format (If needed jpg/Multi-page TIFF etc.)

Any suggestions on suitable app for Centos 6.x or Ubuntu 12.x LTS?

Please ignore what I said in my earlier post.

Please follow up with Baskar's request for the /etc/fstab contents in
your Fedora installation.
I agree with him, it looks like you do not have any free hard disk space.

To be sure:
Within Fedora, try to create sda6 and let us know the result.

How many pages that book has?

For example, if the book has 100 pages, you have 100 a4 images, 100 a3
images and 100 a1 images.

Am I right?

Explain your requirement with some more details.
It is tough to get your need from your query.

Thanks for the response.

Fictitious example:
no. of a4 (actually little smaller) say 100 sheets
No. of a3 foldouts about 23 sheets
No . a1 sheets about 8 or so

Total no of sheets 131

The resulting document should have 131 pages: say PDF file with 231
pages (considering that each sheet of a4 is two sided and others one
sided)

No OCR needed. (BTW, OT, anybody aware of good devanagari -- hindi,
marathi, sanskrit -- OCR for partially handwritten text? -- tesseract
has a long way to go there I guess)

> Do you want to stitch all the 100 images as a single file?

No. and yes. Not stiching. Yes a single file with multiple pages.

I too am googling in the meantime.

Oh. yes, indeed I will post by findings. If I am successful.

So you need to convert all the images in a folder into a single pdf file.

the utility 'convert' from the package imagemagick can do this.

convert *.jpg images.pdf

for further info, see here.

Thanks again.

I think I am wrestling with a multipage TIFF file.

I doubt if JPG format supports it.

Anyways, in for an interesting rendezvous, I guess.

I use PDF shuffler.

If your file format is .pdf, you can try this, this is very easy.

(if they are not .pdf, then, this is not the answer).

Assuming you want to create a PDF file,
You have a one stop solution to your problem : imagemagick.
It is as simple as:
convert -adjoin -page A4 *.jpg book.pdf

But first you need to convert the A3 and A1 size images to A4 either by
scaling them or by splitting them into 2 (for A3) or 8 (for A1) parts. You
could use imagemagick to do this too. Use the -crop feature if you want to
split. Use the -scale feature to scale.

Besides what you have found and others have suggested, there is
PDFedit <http://pdfedit.cz/en/index.html>

It is in Debian repos and I suspect it is available for *ubuntu
flavors, not sure about CentOS.

I have used it in and the results were fine for what I wanted to accomplish.

A search for "pdf stitch" also gave PDFsam:
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfsam/>
Screen shots look promising.

YMMV with both of the above.

Please do write back about whichever solution works out for you.

I need to apologise to the group - when I used to do installations on a
daily basis, it was dinned into me that one could have at the most 4
primary partititons, since I have not done this for the past 6-7 years I
had forgotten this. I have got it figured out now. Thanks all - I will
try again and revert.

Subject: [Ilugc] workshop at Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College, Coimbatore
Message-ID: <1342250750.1246.18.camel@xlquest.web>

hi,

on behalf of ilugcbe Govind and I conducted a one day workshop at SREC
on python and git. About 40 students attended, the workshop was hands
on, and all the students were able to complete the assignments given to
them.

lesson learned: git is too geeky to teach to students who are clueless
about version control - subversion or mercurial is a better bet.

observation: 10 years ago we had to beg and plead to be allowed to
conduct a workshop in any college. We had to spend our own money and the
managements used to ignore us. Nowadays we are greeted with flowers and
garlands, the managements do their utmost to give us all the facilities,
they pay expenses and even give an honorarium! This is my experience in
the Coimbatore region and in Kerala.

@Ramdoss, I understand for a commercial project, you require
vendor/manufacturer support for Linux. I am just adding this information to
the thread so that students can benefit:

Almost all these devices are generically OS agnostic. Unless the device
manufacturer has gone overboard to protect it from being used in Linux
and/or has a proprietary protocol.

Today most of them feature an USB interface. The USB interface is an
USB/Serial convertor and almost all the convertors are supported by Linux.
When you connect the device to the USB port of a linux box, a `usbserial`
port gets listed in /dev (/dev/USBtty0 etc).

Irrespective of OS, its just a matter of programming the serial port i/o to
follow the manufacturer's published protocol.

Arun

2 booted mint and made another 60gb partition and installed mint there.

3 on restart, the machine booted directly into mint

4 booted from the fedora installation dvd and restored grub. I now have
a nice dual boot system - I still have one more partition available,
should I install mandriva, or does someone have suggestions for

          How about Open Indiana. I guess the current build is 151a
and it is a nice OS[1]. For someone used to the GNU/Linux system, it
should be very easy. IIRC, it has just gnome(gnome2). And it has the
usual tools - firefox, thunderbird etc. They have a synaptic like UI
for installing new software. Would be worth a try. Thanks

[1] Open Indiana is an OS using the illumos kernel, which was a fork
of Open Solaris after Oracle acquired Sun

Subject: [Ilugc] IR Receiver that works on Linux for an XBMC HTPC
Message-ID: <1342277972.1745.8.camel@mjolnir>

Hello, everyone,

I'm looking to buy an IR receiver that works easily on Linux. I know
that it's possible to build one, but I'm really short on time here (I'm
leaving for elsewhere soon and I want to make a HTPC for my
parents/brother). Also, how does this sort of thing work? I have a
Radioshack Universal Remote. Does the receiver need to be built for a
specific remote or will it pick up the stuff and do the mapping from
button-press-received to keypress in software? In the latter case, I can
probably have the Radioshack remote configured correctly rather easily.

The less complicated, the better. Any help is appreciated.

What I've found so far is that lots of TV tuner cards come with an IR
remote and a receiver. However, no one seems to post on the Internet
about whether the remote and receiver work with the card or just the
TV-tuner part. I could probably pick up an Intex TV Tuner card and try
to get it to work, but I haven't used a TV Tuner on Linux in years (last
was a couple of years ago with bttv and a Pinnacle PCTV 50i Pro, I
think) and don't really know how these things work.

By the way, I'm thinking of running XBMC because it looks way better.
The output will be an ancient CRT TV for now, but my brother can
probably work things out once I have everything set up so that if they
buy a newer LCD TV, things will be fine. Any opinions on that are
welcome as well. I have little experience with this, but hopefully
things will go smoothly.

Regards,

Message-ID: <CADDQFRsoTHYjreu_0UzTP09nyDYTiPY122MkSdjcw-SLUPSfsw@mail.gmail.com>

The term "ethical hacking" usually makes no sense because "ethics" is
part of "hacking".
Cracking is reserved for "actual methods for illegally subverting the
security of computer systems".
Terms like "ethical cracking" may make sense in complex
corporate-political scenarios

But the FSMK people have decided to use the term "ethical hacking" for
"hacking + Activism" and possibly beyond.
http://www.fsmk.org/ethical-hacking

Is this a good move?

time will tell , so far the users of the term have had made money , also
the motive of FSMK is not clear may be they wanted to catch the attention
as in publicity since the spin web doctors and media have done so much to
register the term in people 's mind it  makes it so much more easier to
sell something than  just old philosophical and moral high ground points.

etymologically speaking there is some research to be done to find how this
word came into being , a quick web search just could find one such paper on
the http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/facpubs/1451/ term but alas that too
was not accessible to me it looks like lots of terms like spam,hacker which
have made it to the urban language then to the dictionaries , so may be
this term will be as acceptable to you as spam is over period of time.

this was the most interesting one did not know that RMS was a whithat till
i read this http://www.protectivehacks.com/Ethical-Hacking.html , as i said
this one and many more like these ....have used and abused the term.

so overall it speaks of changing times and desperation of certain
organizations to have themselves heard you should be writing to the
organizations and the individuals in order to understand what the motives
has been if you have an issue with them.

but yes i agree it does make a case to study and publish something about
what the term really means wrt to free software , open source etc..  now i
think i am getting into an area where most people here are not comfortable
with like researching with these terms itself , i think it will soon become
OT :-) because of the etymological research we are talking about.

FreeBSD?

If your CPU [a] and motherboard are LKVM capable + 4GB of RAM, then I
would suggest that you keep one primary OS and keep all the rest of
the hard disk for your /home and experiment with the different OS in a
LKVM environment.

[a] Personal observation, dual core with 2 threads/core has given me
better multitasking between my VMs and other desktop apps running in
the primary OS.

@ Mani

As has been suggested, please do not cross post topics that are going
to generate talk back.  Most of the  members of the *lists* you have
cross posted to are not likely members of *all/some* of the same lists
and therefore responses are going to be disjointed in each of those
mailing list.

Please post them individually and summarize the discussion from each
of the lists in one final post.

FOSS or no FOSS,  FSMK needs to get the message across to a larger
audience than those who do differentiate between "hacking" and
"cracking"  - marketing reality.

Perhaps in the workshop content they can highlight this point across
to the attendees.

/etc/profile is read by most shells whereas /etc/bash.bashrc would be
read by bash shell.

What is the output of $JAVA_HOME?   Some users may have set this
variable in their $HOME - ensure they are picking it up from the
correct location.

Hi,

Please advise me on how to use the same sudoers file for multiple machines.

And also earlier there was an option to use the same usr partition for
different machines, will that still apply, as fedora 17 doesnt allow for a
different usr partition.

Also please let me know as to why arent files created for all the eth
interfaces. I only see the ifcfg file for the first interface and for the
other 2 I later added to my VM, I only see dhco lease files and no ifcfg
files.

Message-ID: <CAFHFDA=e2OrX=ATmw4rY=Qo4Z8kxsnASvVrE8+jdc-eQBjifRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

In VirutalBox my Host OS is Ubuntu and my Guest OS is also Ubuntu.

Host OS is connected through Wired LAN to a router.  Can my Guest use the
wireless adaptor which is currently no being using in my host to connect to
the outside world ?

When I searched the net many says it cannot be done and to use a USB
Wireless Dongle for the Guest OS, However some of the geeks here may have
attempted something like this.

Without giving the specific use case it is not possible to provide
ideas. You can access net in VirtualBox guest if host has internet
connection. This should be sufficient for most use case.

Qemu has PCI pass through. I am not sure whether that is mainlined or
will it work for you. If you are geeky enough to try just give it a
try and write about it if successful.

If you have ample time and knowledge use libpciaccess to access the
Wifi card from user space (i.e., from within Virtual Box and let the
guest know about the PCI card). For this you may need to modify
Virtual Box source code and also the guest kernel (may be a Linux
kernel module). I don't have much info than this and I am not sure how
much time it will take. I guess it may take more than 3 months for a
normal developer doing this work full time (If virtual box source code
is needed to be modified and a linux kernel module has to be written).

If your Wifi card is PCI based then the above two methods will work.
If it is based on USB you need not do anything big - just choose a
menu in the Virtual Box to associate the USB device to the guest.

Well my case is I want to practise setting up Adhoc network using WLAN.
Since I don't have may wlan cards as spare I though I would be able to set
up three or more virtual machine using the wireless card in bridge mode to
accomplish the same.

It means that the code may not be in the official repository - it may
be lying in someone's branch. I did not check this so please make sure
if that is the case. It is best to contact qemu mainling list or IRC
for getting more information and using this.

Also qemu is far better than Virtual Box considering guest CPU
performance. So use it if you don't have any strong reason for not
coming out of Virtual Box.

My friend is looking for a browsing center management software.

A software in linux clients, which ask for username/password to enable the
desktop
and calculates the time spent.

A public server should be used to manage the users and authenticate.
Bills should be generated on the time spent by the user.

If anyone interested in developing such a system, send me a private mail.

In my mac (BSD based) it works. You need to setup Virtual box to use the
host's wireless adapter in bridged mode. Set this bridge mode network
adapter as your second network interface in your guest. Leave the first
interface in the guest for NAT.

Another option if you are using a USB wireless adapter is to enable USB
filters in Virtual box. Add the wireless card in the filter list. Now boot
your guest OS and when it is done booting, unplug and plug your USB
wireless adapter. Your guest OS will now claim it. If your guest OS
supports the wireless card, you would be able to set it up as a network
interface internally without depending on the host.

My knowledge regarding the USB pass through option is based on using USB
key dongles and pen drives. Have not tried it with wireless adapters.
Please let me know if it works.

Arun

one reason why I need more distros is that my bsnl data card has not
worked for me after fedora 12. It does not work in mint either. So I am
looking for a distro in which it will work.

Most likely a kernel/driver issue. I face similar problems with several 
of my hardware components and I just stay on 2-3 yr old distributions. 
May be if we compile the kernel/modules from older versions and install 
it with the newer distributions, it might work.

On a side note, this kinda indicates that MS is no longer the only one 
who drops support for older hardware on releasing a newer version.

Do you mean to say that inside you guest if you type iwconfig you are able
to see a interface showing up ?  Cool :-)  Does it mean that if My Host
machine is running a BDS OS and If I am running a VirutalBox on it,  My
Guest OS would be able to see the Wireless interface with iwconfig command ?

Not exactly, you could have moved it into the extended partition. It

Sounds like a Cybercafe application.

By "public server"  do you mean the "server"  is in the cloud instead
of the LAN?

I will check it with an USB wireless adapter. It should work once the guest
gets complete access to the USB device.
But we probably can't assume that what works in a mac might work in
Free/OpenBSD as the Virtual Box implementation in a mac might be different.

Bridging through the network interface of the Host OS, is the most
common case for the Guest OS to connect to the 'net (when you want the
Guest OS to be visible w/o NAT)

In VirtualBox, you can bridge a Guest OS with the Host OS WiFi
interface where in the Host OS acts as the wpa supplicant and the
auth. is done by the Host OS.   The Guest OS still sees an ethernet
iface card - the bridging is done at the Host OS level.

Is this what you are trying to accomplish?

I suggest you join the VBox mailing list and web forums.  It is more
likely for you to get specific answers there.

However, before you pull out your wallet for an USB WiFi dongle ...
as an alternate, IIRC Linux KVM  can pass the HW PCI bus address to
the guest.   I have no experience with it though.

Some ref. links that might be of help.

<http://www.linux-kvm.com/content/exposing-host-pci-devices-guest>

<http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/rhel6/rhel_6_virtualization/rhel_6_virtualization_chap-Virtualization-PCI_passthrough.html>

Good luck,

As always -- you can share the solution after you have got it working :)

BTW - do not snip the From line - it identifies who wrote what.

Your response is vague.   You are assuming that we can visualize your
desktop and the applet dialog boxes etc.

Where/What application?  (what is your desktop GNOME/KDE/XFCE/LXDE or
something else)?

Can you paste a screen shot of the GUI and put it up on imagebin.org?

As an alternate, I would suggest dispense away with all this research
of what works and does not.

I use an USB wireless keyboard/mouse combo.   I get to control XBMC
and also use the same as a PC to browse the net, read email etc. when
I am in the mood to be a couch potato :)   OK it is less glamorous
than an IR remote control but it meets my functional requirements.

I have not used webmin for a looong time.   I understand it requires
"root" access for login **or** does it have a separate user auth for
the SVN interface?

Also please avoid top posting.

@ OP - a search for "webdav svn client" will give you quite a few
links that discuss the details of web UI to SVN.

HTH,

Looks like he *sold* his address book for a "free" service @ Flipora.

Just when I started to think that this kind of stuff had gone away
from this list :(

I am sure he would not share his userid/password if we were to ask him
for the same (even privately) but it is *OK* to do so with Flipora -
blind trust for an unknown third party.

I'm also intending to build a HTPC using the Raspberry Pi which has
XBMC ported on it. I was planning to use a wireless keyboard cum
trackball device with its own dongle from Logitech that costs approx
2K. Advantage I saw was - no drivers needed. Was important as I had
little control on the XBMC distro.

Message-ID: <CALARHWZL=yfrO3smmD-QV00JS3qv5nUsQTViv_6XgFknZ8+BiA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I need some help/ideas in coming up with a shell script.

Basically, the script should install 1 or 2 or 3 packages based on the
input arguments.

For example, if I type in pkgscript.sh a1 a2 a3, it should install all the
3 scripts and pkgscript.sh a1 should install only a1.

If a user enters only pkgscript.sh, it should ask for arguments and then
proceed accordingly.

Thanks in advance.

Use $# and $@. A rough outline is :

if  [[ $# == 0 ]]; then
    <do something>
fi

for pkg in "$@"
do
         <install ${pkg}>
done

Please read up on bash programming. This will be covered there. thanks

I have 4 machines..

server1
server2
server3
server4
I have configured sudo file on server1. I want all other servers to use the
same file. Everytime I update the file I shouldnt have to copy it to all
other servers, instead they should use the same file.

Ashish

Login as root.
Open the /etc/sudoers file

Add the following line (don't change the line which has the root user):
anwar     ALL=(ALL)  ALL
or, if you don't want to provide your password all the time you use sudo:
anwar     ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD: ALL

This sounds like great advice. I think I'll get a wireless keyboard as
well. I did order an Intex TV tuner card as well. Now that I think about
it, the wireless keyboard is far superior. You can type stuff in and
whatnot. It'll look a bit odd lying on the coffee table is all.

kill is a word we normally use to mean murder. ;)

In the UNIX world we often use it to destroy wayward processes.

We also use it to send signals like SIGINFO.

$ pkill -INFO dd

$ kill -l
 1    HUP Hangup                        17   STOP Suspended (signal)
 2    INT Interrupt                     18   TSTP Suspended
 3   QUIT Quit                          19   CONT Continued
 4    ILL Illegal instruction           20   CHLD Child exited
 5   TRAP Trace/BPT trap                21   TTIN Stopped (tty input)
 6   ABRT Abort trap                    22   TTOU Stopped (tty output)
 7    EMT EMT trap                      23     IO I/O possible
 8    FPE Floating point exception      24   XCPU Cputime limit exceeded
 9   KILL Killed                        25   XFSZ Filesize limit exceeded
10    BUS Bus error                     26 VTALRM Virtual timer expired
11   SEGV Segmentation fault            27   PROF Profiling timer expired
12    SYS Bad system call               28  WINCH Window size changes
13   PIPE Broken pipe                   29   INFO Information request
14   ALRM Alarm clock                   30   USR1 User defined signal 1
15   TERM Terminated                    31   USR2 User defined signal 2
16    URG Urgent I/O condition          32    THR Thread AST
$

The signals are reported by the shell but they are not in the shell.

The signals are defined by kernel, libc and so on.

If you want to reboot your machine you can kill the init process or
the pid -1 or something.

I think this differs between UNIXes.

Also you can go to single user mode with kill.

I don't do those things.

Being able to stop a process or re read the config file with a

$ pkill -HUP inetd

is good enough.

I find that many processes do not like the pgrep pkill style.

They want this.

$ kill -9 23433

after doing a grep

$ ps ax|grep <foobar>


If you want a process to dump core for you again kill can do it.

In networking C code we normally ignore the SIGHUP signal.

signal(SIGHUP, SIG_IGN);

Signals are one of the IPC mechanisms but they only signal events as they
 do not carry any payload.

We have to do that some other way.

Which shell are you using? Bash completion is not displaying those

One way I can think of is using inotify + rsync. Use inotify to
monitor changes to the file. Whenever the sudoers file is changed, use
the rsync script to copy it over to the other machines.
You can can replace rsync with version control tools like git so you
can even version the various revisions of the file.

       Bash shows it for me. kill -l  in bash 4.1.x shows the same
output. But, when you say bash completion, were you trying kill <TAB>
<TAB> ? I don't think that shows it up. thanks

This lists the PIDs. But I am looking for the number that is equivalent

May be this one is customized by Debian or the OP might be using some

         What do you get, when you do kill -l <enter> ? I too am on
Debian Sqeeze(6.0.3) and I get the list of signals available. IIRC, -l
just lists the signals and doesn't take any parameters/arguments. So
tab completion probably doesn't work. Thanks

Git will, by default, happily turn /etc/sudoers 0644. Then there will be
some trouble. etckeeper is supposed to work around this and someone
seems to have asked a similar question on ServerFault regarding that:

Thanks for informing that. I hadn't tried the solution myself so was
unaware of the same.
Just wondering how would tools like puppet and chef work for such
requirements. It would definitely be an overkill for just the sudoers
file. But, considering if it were to manage all the 4 servers, how
useful would it be? Someone here with hands-on experience of that.
PS: Sorry for taking the thread at a tangent but I feel it would be a
useful extension of this question so I'm not starting off a new
thread.

Subject: [chennaipy 1394] June Meet Minutes
To: chennaipy at googlegroups.com


Chennaipy met again on the 30th of June, with talks on a wide range of
topics. The meet was originally scheduled for 23rd June, but due to a
full day power cut at the venue, the meet was rescheduled. The
reschedule resulted in a low turn out.

We started the meet with a quick introduction to Python, as
always. But this time Rengaraj gave the introduction. People gathered
were brought up to speed on Python syntax and data types.

=== Python Classes

Rengaraj then started his talk on Python classes. He covered the
syntax for creating a class. He showed how to create any empty class,
instantiate it and attach attributes to the object. He then showed how
the same thing can be done by using the init method.

=== Regex Module

The next talk was the Regex module by Reegan. Reegan gave short
introduction to the `re` module. He then gave quick recap of the
meta-characters. He then demonstrated the `findall()` function in the
`re` module. The `findall()` function took a regex and a string, a
returned a list of occurrences of the regex in the string. A
dictionary file containing words with their part of speech and
meaning. He use `findall()` to print verbs, adjectives and nouns from
the dictionary file, by writing appropriate regex.

=== Named Tuple

The next talk was Named Tuples by Vijay. Vijay showed the purpose and
advantages of tuples. He then listed their shortcomings:

  * Tuples with many members, do not indicate what value goes to what
    member, which affects the readability.

  * Accessing members in the tuple, is done using index, which also
    affects readability.

He then showed the `namedtuple` factory function that can be used to
generate classes that behave to tuples, except that members can be
accessed by name. The tuples also can be created by using keyword
arguments. This gives us all the advantages of tuples, which affecting
readability and maintainability of the code.

=== Demo: Python microweb frameworks on Android

Next was a demo on microweb frameworks on Android. Vijay used
bottle.py, a microweb framework, a demonstrated the following
applications.

  1. A simple hello world web app.
  2. A date and time web app.
  3. A form based web app, to add two numbers.

He then showed how this apps can be run on an Android mobile, using
SL4A. The web app runs using the webserver provided by the microweb
framework, and can be accessed through the phone's browser. The best
part was that the scripts run unmodified on the mobile phone.

Then to top it off, he showed a hangman game written as web app, which
was developed on the PC, and runs unmodified on the mobile as well.

Dear all,

Electronics For You, India, EFY group who also hosts the Popular Linux For

College students, all other Open Source and Free Software developers
development to light.

1. Recently one of my friend (Via Facebook) named " Vivek Rajendran " - who
studies at Kalasalingam University developed an basic Electronic tool that
converts Resistor color bands to values and vice versa, he has achieved
this using Java and as cross platfrom. The Source is open and under GPL.

More details here:-
http://news.electronicsforu.com/e1/creativenewsele.asp?edid=86575

2. And one more app (GillyCricket) which i created the basic version
initially and later two of them forked it and made it better and also
ported to Android.

More details here:-
http://news.electronicsforu.com/e1/creativenewsele.asp?edid=86694

While having a talk with Diksha P Gupta, Who is also in the mailing list of
ILUGC, i hope, She said EFY is ready to cover and bring out such
developments done around Free Software and Open source.

If you are the one who are doing such things or you know some of them doing
the same, You can contact:- diksha (dot) gupta @ efy (dot) com

The ^right^ way to do this ofcourse is to have centralized sudo rather than
copying the sudoers file to every machine:

https://www.google.co.in/search?q=centralized+sudo

If you think that is more effort than warranted for your use case, I would
suggest going with scp (if you are ok with overwriting, that is) every time you
update sudoers, basically:

$ export SYSTEMS="192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3 192.168.1.4"
$ visudo && for i in $SYSTEMS; do scp /etc/sudoers root@$i:/etc/ ; done

If having the same sudoers file on all system is all that you need, this ought
to suffice

one problem apart from availability of driver for GNU/ Linux is, the 
availability of an advanced Application that makes the usage of such

Such apps have binaries for Windows & Mac.

That is still an obstacle.

I agree.
Some of these devices do come with software which can be used out of the
box to solve simple use case scenarios. These software are almost always
not available for Linux systems. I have had this problem with a bar code
printer. The printer came with  `open` protocols, but a very important
label design utility was Windows only. We had to design the labels in a
Windows box and then use the file created in a Linux based system where the
bigger application was running.

Arun

Why not use a map service like OpenStreet map to clearly indicate the
location and put it up as screenshot / direction route from nearest
busstop on the website ?

Anyways congrats for the new office :)

That's funny :).  T Nagar is not in Kanchipuram. It is right in the

I have Lava 720G and Huawei E1750. Both work perfectly with Ubuntu and
Arch. The latter even works with USB port on my router, which supports
data cards.

Message-ID: <CAFHFDA=KSXfFTfhez3TD=b999eGvCWPj7_879bi=H0aR5qg6yg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am really exited with how nautilus can show a remote ssh servers files on
a GUI locally when we try to Connect to a server over SSH.  The remote
directory comes and sits under ~/.gvfs.

I also found that this can be done by opening you home folder on Nautilus
and typing CTRL+L then in the location bar typing sftp://username at server

Now my question is I am trying to do this over command line to mount that
remote file locally under ~/.gvfs however I don't seem to get the correct
page on Google or my search text is wrong.

although apache and tomcat and java are open source, this is a Linux
users group, posts with respect to other *nix flavours are ok, but I am
of the view that Windows does not qualify.

I was wondering myself - I apologize. I will take care of this in the
future.

In any case, am trying to get the end users to change to Linux too. I hope
to make that happen soon. :)

On Ubuntu there is NO need to install drivers. Just plug in the Huawei 
dongle in USB port and goto 'Edit Connections'. Goto Mobile Broadband 
section and I think you will see Huawei something there. Edit settings 
if any and connect.

The tamil meaning is more suggestive of
'unrestricted'

Anybody's software foundation.
Name of the foundation should include 'freedom'.

menporul does not suggest 'knowledge' and is derived from 'product'.
I would like that changed too.

Well, that might at times confuse, is it FSF.

A lot us are part of that also.

We have Apache Software Foundation, SPI all dedicated to Free/ Open 
Source Software.

Though we registered it as Menporul - as that is how is has been 
established over the period of time, Personally, I have started 
referring Software simply as Menmam (suggested by Ila. Sundaram) these 
days.

But, as the name has been registered, it requires more effort to take it 
off.

Thank you for the feedback. Will look into it at right time.

Greetings,

I am aware that we can use the SIM card of say Vodaphone/Airtel using
a generic Data card with a laptop/netbook.

My question is (of course it is silly): there an application for
laptop/Netbook as the mobile instrument for making voice calls/sending
SMS?

Can skype or something like that be ear-twisted to do this?

I am OS agnostic for this question.

TIA

Message-ID: <CAFHFDA=uto146dvw2rUpag3SwNF22bHEenW5hPtY8sLjUz=Zeg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 on a Pentium 4 box with 1GB RAM using
Mercury Mother board.

When the CD booted I gave the option of Try Ubuntu without Install and once
on the Desktop I am attempting to install the OS.

Step1: It asked me for Language
Step2: It asked me for 8GB free space I clicked on Continue

That is it there is no Step3 after that Did any one face this problem.

One more thing the Live CD just detects my LED monitor with 1020P
resolution as 1280x1020 how to get the entire 1920x1020 ?  I tried using
xrandr however it is failing to detect the rgamma :-(

Debian Squeez did work out of the box with 1080P I wanted to install Ubuntu
as I am comfortable with it.

Try the alternate desktop CD and see if you can complete the
installation with it.

Each distro has it's idiosyncrasy vis-a-vis hardware compatibility.
If things work with Debian and not with Ubuntu then the problem is
with Ubuntu.   You may have to dig in specific aspects and file bug
reports on Ubuntu.

I never though the DVD would work provided the number of parts which I took
out of the DVD player.  That is why I did not take pictures of the same.

In future, take pictures.  With digital cameras - you don't have to
worry about buying/wasting rolls.

I tried playing with many distros today and found out that Knoppix, Debian
Squee.. and BackTrack were able to give me Full resolution others were
not.  Funny thing one of my Favourite OS (Fedora) did not even boot on it.

I have a similar problem with an Intel server motherboard with an ATI
video chipset.   Although the LCD monitor connected to it supports up
to 1280x1024, none of the distros tried so far go further than
1024x768.    After some digging around I have found that the kernel
KMS needs to be compiled with an ATI  flag that is not present in the
distros (openSUSE and Debian) I have tried till now.    This could be
your problem.   Compare the config files of the kernel from each
distro and see what diff between them throws out.

For this, at the time of entering the password.
Change the Keyboard layout to "English (US)".

This option is available either on the Top / bottom panel.

It is a bit curious; when I sent this booklist earlier respondents
expressed a wish to pay for many these books (my mail was unfortunately
ambiguous, presumably leading people to think I am offering to sell the
books). In my latest mail I made it clear I am not selling them but they
are for free.

And I got zero responses :) One wonders, does "Zero Cost" equal to lower
value?

Anyways, now the books are with the Ramakrishna Mutt Library in Mylapore.

Subject: [Ilugc] [X-POST] Introducing PRS: a web-app in
 Python+SQLAlchemy+Tornado for clinic patient record maintenance
Message-ID: <CAFkt3UP2Wp3N=BDpL-p=ZFi9cbw8sXvnFUKung47kzrwav2Ejg@mail.gmail.com>

I am associated with a charity clinic in Delhi through a relative who is a
consulting doctor there. On his request I have developed a very simple
patient history and record management system on a full python stack and
released under the GNU Affero GPL. PRS is written as a web application, and
comes bundled with the Tornado webserver. As such it is intended to run on
a desktop (Linux, Windows or Mac) without internet connectivity but can
also be deployed on a server and accessed through the network (see below).

The clinic staff are currently evaluating the software, and I expect this
to go "into production" in the next month or two. So it is somewhat stable
- in beta status, and there will be many opportunities for small features
and enhancements. It could also be extended to support work flows in other
clinics as well. As such it is a good opportunity for college students or
others interested in playing with a fully functional Python based web
application, while contributing to open source.

I invite you to browse the source code
at:https://github.com/skarra/PRSand/or give the application a spin
here:
http://ec2-107-21-172-206.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8765/ (This is hosted on
a free AWS instance and will be very very slow. Only meant for a very quick
peek; it is definitely recommended that you clone the git repo and give it
a try beyond a few preliminary clicks)

I am happy to mentor any students interested in playing with PRS and
improving it in the process. If you know of any other organization who can
use a software like this, please go ahead and fork it.

NOTE: It only runs on Chrome for now.

Anyone know what these DOT guidelines are ? Apparently, it looks like

On a side note, Please don't suggest ways to circumvent the block, I am

Am able to access it using my BSNL broadband connection! Maybe Aircel is
overreacting by blocking all of pastebin instead of a specific url!!

It is supposed to be "Libre" (for free as in freedom) and not
"Liberal". The latter may be anything.

If am not wrong, many sites including pastebin, vimeo etc. has been
blocked by all ISPs except BSNL by Madras High Court's order! Thats
why its accessible in bsnl mobile/broadband, not in airtel,aircel,
reliance etc!

But the Madras High Court later clarified that ISP's cannot block whole
sites and only specific URLs that are to be provided by the entity asking
for the blocking. So, if the ISPs are blocking entire sites, they are going
against the court orders!

Dear all,

One day FOSS workshop was conducted in Sakthi Polytechnic College,
Near Bhavani, Erode Dt. (http://www.sakthitech.net/spc) on 20/07/12 for the
2nd and 3rd year
students of Computer Technology, totaling 120+ students.

A hands-on session was given to all the students to remotely install Ubuntu
12.04 LTS in their
desktops.  After installation the students were introduced to package
management using apt-get / ubuntu software center.

I would like to thank Mr. Senthilarasu, HOD / Computer Technology for
organising the workshop.

By the time the information trickles down from the legal dept. to the
management and then to the worker bees, the message in the original
order is perhaps lost or it is still pending on some one's 2do list.

Message-ID: <CALre89kVez7swypbobHy7i1cWdi=trFABtWkmC64qYXSD96PFg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
     a website is hosted on zope and plone , now since the
organization does not have  resources to manage the site they plan to
move it to a  shared hosting provider , initially i thought of moving
the whole instance to GAE ( google app engine ) , but after reading
this thread  http://plone.293351.n2.nabble.com/Plone-on-Google-Appengine-td1346985.html
it looked like a bad idea , the other idea is to move the existing
instance to some third party plone hosting providers listed here
http://plone.org/support/hosting-providers/

wanted to know your experiences in dealing  with this kind of
situation and providers and any recommended provider for the
migration.

TIA

They have a VPS in place now they want to move away from it since
there is no one to take care of it , so thinking of ways out , need to
explore some virtual hosting kind of provider for plone , i doubt if
they are available ,  if i do not get any then i may suggest them to
shelve plone site altogether

Dear friends,

I recently came across this tool. Thought of sharing it here, so that it
would be helpful for someone to create and publish books digitally and also
can be used under Open Resource.

And my thought is that Kaniyam Team can make use of it to bring
about collaboration online for more users to engage in writing articles for
the Kaniyam editions.

Here is the link:- http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/booktype

is it no one to take care of it, or no funds to pay for it? As for
shared hosting, webfaction would be your best bet.

I just checked, it takes about 5 minutes to set up a plone site in
webfaction - and from several years of using webfaction for various
clients, I can testify that it rocks seriously, and their support and
uptime is absolutely fantastic.

Hi,

Has anybody in this list or people you know - have made money by creating
open source products? I am not talking about people who earn money by
providing services around someone else's effort of creating the primary,
core product (say the LAMP stack).  I am talking about people who are
creative and made stuff from scratch. Off late I have started to have these
conflicting thoughts in my mind whether this entire open source movement is
made up of a small bunch of charitable people (the creators) and a huge
bunch of leeches who monetize the charity.

I personally feel like a leach and have used brilliant open source apps
free of cost to my benefit. I never had the time to participate seriously
in giving back content to the open source pool (apart from a few
donations). This is not an excuse, as I would have found time if I believed
that it was my responsibility. Anybody/Organization associated with this
group have a give-back policy?

This is not a troll or to start a flame war. Just want to know about how
you guys think.

Regards,
Arun

A significant part of the 'open source' is the concept of "open a
restaurant but give away the menu". In effect, the availability of the
source code of the product enables two distinct streams of revenue -
feature driven and support/services driven. And, in either case you
are helping to increase the share of the product.

this is a very common thought and question is most of the people in this field.

do not procrastinate this is also good way of contributing back .

Giving is ones personal conscious thing nobody can force or  demand it :-)

i give this simple analogy to students as what they want to be , there
are gold rush people ( the guys with one idea and want to make it big
through product or service )  and people who will be making spades (
the guys who actually build things )  for the gold rush , may be
mostly you have seen and interacted with people who are into  making
spades.

anyway what is that big idea you have on your mind?

Increase share of the product meaning?
I am talking from a business perspective. It is one thing to
feel exhilarated when hundreds of thousands of people use your app. But
does this realize into making money?

Nice analogy.
But... The spades are free as in free beer!
How many people even look at the names of the authors of `that` brilliant
little library under LGPL which saved you a few days of coding? :)

more user base , ultimately there is hope that there will be streams
of revenues from support and customization ( like adding features)

yes that is where business sense kicks in how to get a dollar out of
customer or it could be the other way round  too when the product is
so good he willingly starts paying what you demand , this risk and
reward scenarios is what any business is all about , and an
entrepreneurs you live with it .

Two examples that come to mind straight away:

HasGeek: http://jace.zaiki.in/2012/06/26/technology-outsource-vs-open-source
Fusion Charts:
http://www.fusioncharts.com/goodies/fusioncharts-free/product-licensing/

Different personalities, and different motivations for opening up the
source, but both are worth a look.

Does not matter know from years of working like this in the end the
skill of making will  get paid than the spade itself, since they
invariably want something which they think is unique idea or product
and hence they pay for making it.

as far as sharing the bounty is concerned you can share from what you
have or  you do not have any or one becomes greedy over time , so this
behavior is once social currency which also comes into play.

Subject: [Ilugc] Reg NIS server issue
Message-ID: <CAEsgi+FRFsAfGSrgX_FDDk+SKSX39PO9iRyLWfpuHT8TNP0pNA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi team,

I need your advise on NIS environment.In our office 1 NIS server and 2 NIS
Slave server and 10 NIS client is running.In that scnerio one day one NIS
slave server is down.So that we are not able to connect Some of the NIS
client through SSH because in that yp.conf file have put the entry as NIS
failed slave server first entry and next one is NIS master server.So as per
the Master and Slave concept if one server is down means automatically
switch over to next server but its not happening particularly in one Backup
server of the NIS client.So that all the backup jobs failed on particular
client.But some other server worked on the same day in that server also
same type of entry only existing like failed server is first entry and NIS
master server is 2nd entry.So i need your advise on this is anything we
have to configure on the backp server.Please share your inputs on this.

Regards
Srinivasan

I have. Not much money, but money. My model is like this:

I offer to build applications for the client, charge what I feel is a
reasonable sum and convince them that if the software is open source
from the start it is easier to get people to contribute to it, the code
is available if I drop dead and it is easy for them to upgrade and debug
errors. My costs are cut because whenever I am stuck I can always find
people who are willing to write some code for free (although sometimes I
pay) because it is open source. I also insist on my clients learning the
basics of issue management and refuse to do anything unless a proper
ticket is filed. I do not have to lie to the client about progress and
never give progress reports. I tell them to look at the repo to see if I
am doing work or not. The model often fails because the client cannot
get used to the way I do things. When it succeeds, it works great. The
client as a co-developer. Note that all my work is web apps (not
websites).

Some things I have learned:

1. The person I interact with on the client side *must* be the person
who takes the decisions in the client concern. It does not work if I
have to interact with an underling.

2. The development must be module by module and should go into
production immediately - if the guy wants the whole thing ready before
going into production, I decline to do it.

3. One has to be extremely flexible with regard to design changes and
new feature requests. The client may think he knows what he wants, but
once in production, he may realise he needs something else. One must be
prepared to rip the guts out of the app and rewrite - without losing
data.

4. I push as much of the work as possible on to the client - he has to
enter the data (I may make a script to load the data from a spreadsheet,
but he has to actually get everything ready and run the script). I show
him how to back up, but he has to do it. Likewise simple upgrades like
doing hg pull, hg update and restarting the server is his job. Like wise
for database migration, I give the script - he has to run it.

5. Design - he has to hire someone for that. In one case the guy learned
css and html and did it himself. (it looked horrible, but he was happy).
There are two reasons why I do this - 1. I am not capable of drawing a
straight line even with the aid of a computer and 2. design is the one
field in which the open source methodology does not work. No committee
or group of people can do good design - one guy has to do it. If he
needs help, the helpers have to do what they are told - no vote.

6. Last and most important - make proper agreements and make sure the
schedule of payment is met. No pay, no work. The flip side is that when
they see I am flexible with regard to doing mid course changes and
adding new features they do not quibble about paying more.

One of my big successes was building an app for a Finnish NGO working in
Mumbai. We started with one site and soon several sites in 7 countries
in the region. The lady in charge of Asia then took a year or two off to
take a course on how to get things done by IT people. She was shifted to
Africa and we have now covered 4 countries there. The course she took
did not help her at all as it was to do with how to extract work from M$
Weenies. But she has learned issue management - you may look at the
discussions in the open and closed issues in this project here:

https://bitbucket.org/lawgon/kenyakids/

now her bug/feature reporting is as good as most professionals.

We are soon going worldwide, and quite a few other NGOs are lining up -
my client is doing the marketing for me (and not asking for commission).

I have had one spectacular flop also - some members of our LUG will
remember as they were involved. The flop was due to the fact that I
ignored most of the principles mentioned above - especially point No 1. 

One last comment - do not write code unless 1. some one pays you or 2.
you need it for something you want to achieve. You can think of some
fantastic idea that you think will be the next facebook or will fulfill
a need that people will pay for - ok, if you must, do it, but do not
expect to make money from it. As some one said, if people will not pay
for something, they certainly will take it if it is free.

Move all the package which you have to the location
/var/cache/apt/archives

/var/cache/apt/archives$ ls
firefox_14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1_amd64.deb
libqt4-sql-mysql_4%3a4.6.2-0ubuntu5.4_amd64.deb
openoffice.org-calc_1%3a3.2.0-7ubuntu4.3_amd64.deb
firefox-branding_14.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1_amd64.deb
libqt4-svg_4%3a4.6.2-0ubuntu5.4_amd64.deb

Try to run

apt-get upgrade

That should work.

Subject: [Ilugc] What is wrong?
Message-ID: <CALDskywHbi+HiD=_NBRiVx7OFHX+EXFD6knSY1twvUPVeYjGYQ@mail.gmail.com>

How to find out what is wrong with you?

If you are a techie the reason will most likely be the code you are
 writing.

It has bugs.

How to identify the issue?

One possibility is that of using printf. Logic is usually the issue.

Then you use the gdb tool along with some breakpoints and tracing.

You can also use profiling tools and try to do some guesswork about
 what could go wrong.

Alright what if it is a networking issue? Packets getting dropped, slowed
 down, TCP connection not going through?

Use netcat, tcpdump, wireshark and debug.

What about system being too slow, thrashing, very sluggish response?

Use top, kill the offending process.

You should realize certain things take time, p7zip, copying to USB
stick and so on.

You should not end up killing them. ;)

In your programming if you put a busy wait where you can easily do a sleep that
 is poor programming.

But most of the situations you face are due to other issues.

Choice of the Linux distro also matters hell of a lot. You can start
with a commercial thing
 but slowly learn to use Debian.

Then also play with FreeBSD. You may not like it but it will be better
than Debian or other Linux.

There are also certain hardware bugs like gcc crashing which is caused
by defective RAM.

If your VM reports bugs it is likely the RAM.

Other than copying deb files you are supposed to copy the repository
info - without this apt will not know about the latest version of
packages and may try to download the version available in it's
repository. I have created an application that does this job.

You can visit https://launchpad.net/share-ubuntu-updates to get more
info. The code provides the necessary info. It's a simple Qt
application that does the job for you.

Hope this helps,

Dear Mr. Kenneth.

forgive me (and bear with me too) I always think that your replies are very
egostic (forget the word - It just came to my mind. take the meaning only).

but this one explanation gives you as a person a totally different
perspective.

superb guideline, and did not wasted even one word.  every startup (let
alone a FOSS developer) should go through this with respect to his work.

thanks sir.

with warm regards

Subject: [Ilugc] Grub Installation fails in lesser versions - BMR restore
	[OT]
Message-ID: <CAPABxOE-+L-v3-x04Cq1AutTWqEt09K1hmzOUm0FP2xdLwvL5w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

This topic is purely on a problem in installing grub in my LINUX BMR
process... A major problem too..

I am designing Linux BMR where i do the following..

   - Backup the " / " as a whole .. with partition details ..etc
   - And using the Knoppix Live CD i first create the partitions with
   respect to backed up data , and mount the partitions..
   - Then i copy all the files to the hard disk.. and apply symbolic links.
   - Finally i install grub to the hard disk.

By doing the above process , i am able to backup and restore the CentOS
machine of Version more than 6.0. But the problem comes in lesser versions
in the final stage *(i.e) in the time of installing grub.
*

> I use this command " chroot /mnt grub-install /dev/sda1 " to install grub

I cant follow this grub command line while i go for coding. I am in need of
some one's help now.. I need to clarified on the following..


   1. Why grub-install command giving stage1 error in versions less than 6.0
   2. Is grub scriptable ??
   3. How can i solve this problem , is there any other way to install grub
   through UNIX C++ code..??

Kindly revert me , if u need some further clarifications...


Thanks,

-Selva

I usually do an apt-get update.    It synchronized the *.bin files in
/var/cache/apt/ to the versions in the repo.

An apt-get install <whatever> picks up the package(s) from
/var/cache/apt/archives if the latest version is there rather than a
download.

apt-on-cd is also an effective tool for this kind of stuff.

Subject: [Ilugc] Grep two lines from text file with different A and B switch
Message-ID: <CAFHFDA=PfGi2ey1Y0QOh8v2KPV3wUC-AAqtaR_LBT-Xz1tUztg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have many text file like so

*Input*
$cat 1/reports/report.txt

MD5 askldfansd23423mnavl;noja

sdlkfasdf
as;ldkjfasd
;laskdflasdf
alsdfj;alsdf
asdlkas;lgasdg

Network Activity

DNS:

HTTP:

Other Activity


Now I need the output like shown below.
*Output*
MD5 askldfansd23423mnavl;noja
Network Activity
DNS:
HTTP:

I can get the first line by the command
$*grep "MD5 " */reports/report.txt*
If I want the next Network Activity
$*grep "Network Activity" -A5 */reports/report.txt*

However how can I get to do both of these in the same line so that their
outputs are interleaved ?

Other way to approach this is to delete lines between MD5 & Network
activity, excluding those lines.

This should do that trick.

perl -e '$_=`cat ipfile`;s/(^MD5.+?$).+?(^Network\s*Activity.*?$)/\1
\2/msi;print'

now you can do a grep.

Cheers,
Uday.

You can use -e or --regexp to match multiple patterns, like
grep -e "Network Activity" -e "MD5 "

But I'm not sure if it's possible to say -A5 to only one of the patterns.

Message-ID: <CANSdqMqGoDvShXYzBUxtHjmM-a7T5HoRqbx98O_pUDDGwYZVBA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We have data acquisition system which works in Windows. After acquisition,
the data automatically gets plotted (I think so!!) in a software called
Easy Plot.

Easy Plot works well with Windows but, not  in Linux (as Expected!!) .
Opening  it using some Virtual mode also is more cumbersome.

Now the problem is the Data can be viewed or copied only if I open it using
Easy Plot. When I try to open the file using either Note Pad (WIndows) or
using Gedit (Linux), I just get a cluster of symbols!!

The Only way that I follow to manipulate with the data in Linux, as of now,
is as follows:
1. Open the file using EasyPlot in Windows.
2. Copy the Data onto a note pad or Spread sheet and Save(Depending on the
data)
3. Reboot the System now to Ubuntu
4. Open the new datafile and Plot/ Check

Is there any alternative means?
Or is there any means to extract the Data and paste it into a Note atleast?

P.S:
Easy Plot is a Software produced by Spiral Software. It was designed to
meet the technical graphing needs of the engineers and researchers. (1986)
More info: http://www.amion.com/ep/epindex.html

File Extensions will be either .ep or .epo or .epw (depending on the type
of data)

Thanks in Advance!

It has nothing to do with Linux.

\--

It must be a binary file. It looks like a closed source, proprietary
software where the binary file format is not an open standard, and
only known to the vendor.

\--

You need to write to the software vendor for support, since it is
neither an open source software, nor do they follow an open file
format.

Meta principles:
0. grub2 is far better than grub (I installed it manually in Scientific Linux)
1. Kernel support would be relevant in case of automatic updates
(scripting may be reqd in this case)
2.  do not mix grub and grub2.

Learn to read manual pages.

  $ man grep

As stated, multiple search patterns can be given using the "-e" option.

I would also encourage you to use a standard file format (xml, yaml,
json, for example) for report.txt, so it can be parsed easily.

Hope you have watched the above video fully.

The point I wanted to make was about the ingenuity.

The above was an example of use of COTS in interesting ways.

Imagining where a pointer would cause and looking for stack/buffer
overflows in open source software is interesting.

But these kinds of project can fire imagination of young students in
the direction of using existing resources and building the little
"glue-on" parts which will help them learn greatly. Given it is
hardware, did anybody notice the mention of Microcontroller bit in the
health check jugaad?

I reckon this forum is for free and open source:
software/hardware/ideas/information.

The raison d'etre for this post the fact that many requests for
project ideas seen on this list in the past few years by students.

Or, reverse engineer the file format using some heuristic. Sometimes,
it is possible and easy, while at other times, it might prove to be
more effort and time than is worth it.

You might want to try searching online for someone who has already
written a converter. My cursory glance did not reveal any immediately.

Do you only want to use the data acquired in a Linux box or acquire the

2. Enter a URL
3. See the source code which server is throwing without running it in the

3. XOR a file

I am exactly looking for a tool like Fileinsight for Ubuntu \ OpenSource

What is the DAS you use?
Who is the vendor?

Do they support GNU/Linux?

check these links.
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7332
http://www.comedi.org/

Check if comedi supports your DAS.
If it supports, you can use python to get the data and plot using
mathplotlib or gnuplot
or any other visualization tool mentioned in

Today I was going through all the process which were running on my system

USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND

What an exe running on my system with no Ubuntu !!!

*bala at machine:~$* *ll /usr/lib/tomboy/Tomboy.exe
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 374272 2010-10-26 22:22 /usr/lib/tomboy/Tomboy.exe**

This confirms that it is an exe, so I started browsing more about the same

which does explain as to why there is an exe.  I really do not know C# to

Due to some reason if Tomcat is restarted the data entered previously say 2
hrs before the restart
vanished from MySql. Till this restart we are able to view or modify the
data and the data is stored in MySql
as it can be viewed directly through Query browser.

Version
Java 1.5
Tomcat 5.5.7
MySql 5.0.75
OS  RHEL 6

What can be the reason?

Raju

Check your application whether it commits the data.

Give some more details as to what logs say for tomcat, mysql etc.

We don't use transaction /rollback.
The default is commit
Tomcat or MySql log we could not find any error

Are there any cronjob which is running ?

Type w at the command prompt to see how many people are logged on to the

Perhaps turning up the verbosity level of mysql may help?

Strictly speaking, I never use DAS.. !!The data is being acquired by an
Electronics team. I just get the acquired data for analysis.
Hence, I am unaware about the DAS. I am not sure if it supports Linux

I have seen them acquire the data using DOS or windows (Depending on
application)

No cronjobs are running either in user or root
w command gives 4 people are logged in
1 root

Subject: [Ilugc] Communication between fork() ed processes
Message-ID: <CALDskyx3QQh2Q4qwvPnRx2u1kCM2VehGSh2w-PoW=2oFQjo6_A@mail.gmail.com>

How to communicate between two processes after you fork()?

IPC mechanisms exist to communicate between related and unrelated processes.

Common methods are simple file I/O or even signals which just trigger.

Perhaps you can trigger a file read after you write to it with a signal.

But I don't do such things. I don't send signals between processes.

Other methods are shared memory and UNIX domain sockets.

I use both.

Shared memory is bit boring. UNIX domain sockets can easily be welded
into the poll(2)
 system call that I normally use anyway.

So I ended up using that instead.

The other common method is using pipe(2).

I have used pipe but not much.

It is unidirectional. Sometimes that is sufficient.

And pipe can work with fork() processes. Only.

UNIX domain sockets are cool since they are very generic and the
semantics for communicating
 across the Internet and UNIX domain sockets are exactly identical.

And you can even communicate with unrelated daemons that way.

In fact I have had to do quite a bit of advanced operations
particularly using web CGI.

They all use UNIX domain sockets.

I find the data transfer, EOF tracking, size that can be transferred,
bidirectional facility, speed
everything very satisfactory.

I found some easy samples for you to try when I Googled. You could
also do what I did. ;)

Socket communications are a very nice topic to learn.

Try to increase the verbosity of the mysql server logging and try to
restart apache and look at the logs may be you can get a clue.

Yes all these four people are authorized.
Further to our search, this happens only 2 or more people entering the data
if only one person is doing the data entry, data is not lost when tomcat is
restarted.

Request you data aquisition team to provide you the data in plain text
format or some other standard format. If they can provide that then GNU
Plot can do the rest. Most programs will have an option to export data into
other formats.

Greetings,

I installed alfresco on ubuntu precise yesternight (the bitnami
stuff). I was able to login and all that.

Today, when i tried after a reboot the http://127.0.0.1:8080/share, no reply.

I am guess that tomcat is not running.

I am not uncomfortable twisting a centos box's ear using chkconfig and all that.

But I am all thumbs when it comes to deb.

Any pointers? (of course a silly question from a noob)

Good old sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat start will definitely work, for one time.
to start the service at boot time\,
sudo  update-rc.d tomcat defaults
more info here
http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-manage-services-with-update-rc.d

and if you prefer the upstart way then see

#chkconfig list all | grep -i tomcat

This command should show you all the runlevels on which Tomcat would be
running on.  However you network should be up before that.

Thanks!

It did not strike me at that point of time. I didn't know
chkconfig/service etc. existed for deb. This sudo prefix business is
distracting me like crazy. I am more comfortable "su -" way.

creature of habit, I guess.

Don`t hesitate to ask anything about linux here.

I think it should be grub.cfg file otherwise check the *grub* file
path in Ubuntu 11

if it grub.cfg then follow this...

*sudo gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg*

or

*sudo vi /boot/grub/grub.cfg*

Hi all,
While looking around to suggest a book for beginners, I came across an
interesting book
Ubuntu: An Absolute Beginner?s
Guide<http://www.makeuseof.com/pages/ubuntu-an-absolute-beginners-guide>The
Book can be downloaded from the Link:
http://www.makeuseof.com/pages/ubuntu-an-absolute-beginners-guide

In that book, it is mentioned that
"*Contrary to common belief*:
Linux is not a corporation
?     Nobody owns Linux
?  *   Ubuntu is not Linux*

Till Date, I am of the opinion that Ubuntu is one among the Linux
distributions.
Is it wrong?

Please clarify

Haha.. Am not hearing it for the first time-had seen such a mention in
an article in ToI few months back.

Ubuntu is very much a GNU/Linux distribution though they are noit
calling it "Ubuntu Linux", runs on Linux Kernal, and is born out of
Debian Linux. Above all, it is the most popular Linux Distribution as
of now, as well!

Linux is just the kernel. Ubuntu is a distribution of various softwares.
Sure it comes with the linux kernel, but it also includes various other
softwares. Saying 'ubuntu is linux', is equal to saying 'ubuntu is libbre
office' or 'ubutnu is gimp', after the distro includes all. A lot of those
softwares have windows versions too!.

I haven't read the book but i am assuming, the author meant there to
highlight that Linux is just the kernel, and the distribution is far
more than just the kernel. Ubuntu does run on Linux kernel as can be
verified using the uname
$ uname -s
Linux

to my knowledge many such foundations are Section 25 kind of 
organizations - not typical charitable organizations.
corporates revolve around such foundations - donating - deploying their 
staff to work directly on upstream projects & they in turn offer 
services as well as device their creations based out of them.
such foundations are also driven by corporates in some cases.
there are corporates that does it in right spirit and set as an example 
& there are corporates/ leeches that violates the spirit.

Well one thing that I insisted so seriously among my colleagues is to 
become developer/ contributor to the projects upon which we offer our 
services, which is so important in my opinion as an Open Source 
Organization. Few realised it.

Have given back & contributed few modules too off late, privately. Hope 
it grows down the line.

Just read that article. It is a very badly worded line. And you can
very well see that they've mentioned in the very next part as to what
I said. You should have read it.

another thing that I have started doing is, go with creations that are 
truly open - not those with dual licensing model.

at the same time, we insist the customer to pay for the subscription to 
the project originator (RedHat/ OpenERP for examples) & to us for the rest.

I can choose to implement without these contributions going up (with 
CentOS & customizing OpenERP through acquired expertise), but these days 
I have started speaking to customers to pay for 1) us  2) originator, 
telling them the reasons and have succeeded too.

chkconfig is available in Debian, *ubuntu, and openSUSE.

*ubuntu also provides service.

With these two utils, enabling services in Debian and *ubuntu is no
different than in RHEL/CentOS/Fedora/openSUSE.

Considering the snowstorm of interest in the talk and the demo, the
actual bit to wonder about should be

doesn't make for much of activity.

If you play music/sound on the F17 box, do you get a sound output ?

Most probable explanation. Your System's sound card does not have an open
source driver, the fedora community is very strict on fully being open
source. Try finding them in additional repos like rmpfusion etc?

Try, try, try till you succeed!   Before dropping it, did you get
involved either in the CentOS-Virt/General or the Eucalyptus mailing
list with your issues?

Try the Ubuntu server 12.04, CSS has put together a very nice step by
step document [a] to get an openstack based IaaS.

It is great that you want to do a project with an open source stack.
You have to think for your self and come to some conclusion as to what
your interests are v/s somebody else's.

You can look into the DIY Drones if you are feeling adventurous.

The issue is with the sound card and/or the audio software (alsa/pulse
audio) and not the head phones.

Do 'lsmod' on your laptop with F16 and Linux Mint;  see what is common
and different for a starting point.

Hi All,

I initially installed Ubuntu 11.10 in my System with the hard disk capacity
of around 90 GB . Now i realized that , I am running out space for my other
file Systems (NTFS). Now if i re-install Ubuntu 12.04 with the hard disk
space around 10 GB , then suggest me the best way to partition the
remaining 80 GB of free space to some other file system (like NTFS)...

Either using "gparted" to partition it once i done with installing Ubuntu
12.04
or Is there some other best approaches are there?

Thanks a lot! That is new learning today for me.

Incidently, I could start the service with a script (I cant remember
the name though) which was right under my nose: alfresco was installed
(using the bitrock/bitnami gui installer) under my home folder. a
little bit of poking around got me started.

Thanks again to all those who responded.

Can you also check the controls that are visible when you attempt to
configure the mixer ? As would be obvious, the idea is to first check
whether the internal speakers can provide a sound output via any
application, thereafter moving on to whether the headphone controls
are turned on/visible and finally moving towards whether one should
stick to PulseAudio or, try with Alsa.

+1 for gparted to resize the partitions.  As always make a backup of
any data on the Ubuntu partition before shrinking the partition size.

OP can always use Windows to do "native" NTFS format on the freed up space.

Or look at adding webchat widget
Here's the code from webchat.freenode.net for #ilugc, some options can
be customised.

This means that the window manager setting in .xsession is not working.

We have a IRC channel to have realtime discussions with our members.

Details:

server: irc.freenode.net
channel name : #ilugc-in

You can use a IRC client like pigdin to connect to our IRC channel.

Check the link http://eclug.homelinux.org/content/view/192/59/
to know how to connect via pidgin


To have some instant chat without installing a IRC client,
I installed a web based chat client in our server.

You can join the chat using the above link.

Let us see in the chat room.

They need to allow web UI for some users who are roaming and access
the mail from a browsing center.

I think, any VPN is the best solution for this.

Hope, using VPN we can make sure that only internal users or VPN
connected users can access the application.

Which VPN is best and easy for windows clients?

I haven't worked directly with Zimbra but the usual methods would be
1. Make it listen only on the internal IP addresses
2. Block external access via firewall

Sometimes, users want to access the webUI from browsing centers.
How to do this, if we block external access via firewall?

Doesn't Zimbra Web UI offer authentication support? Also, if it runs
under apache, you could use htaccess.

You most likely need to change the output device. Different ways to do this:

a. Go to 
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/295/switch-output-audio-devices/
     Slide the toggle button to On, in a bit you'd be asked whether you 
want to install the extension. Select install. Reload gnome-shell (ie: 
Alt+r, type in 'r' and Enter). Now, right clicking the volume icon 
should hopefully show you the different output 'devices'. Select the one 
matching your headphone socket. (btw, if you are at extensions.gnome.org 
check out all the other extensions. Extensions make gnome3 so much more 
usable - In fact, at least for me gnome-shell F17 + extensions 
+gnome-shell-theme-zukini.noarch is proving to be better than gnome2 ;-) 
...yes, that's what I said ! )

b. Open a terminal and execute 'gnome-control-center', click on Sound, 
in the 'Output' tab, check if you have something like 'Analog 
Headphones' in the drop down for 'Connector'. Select that and then try.

if this doesn't work ...dump gnome and use something like xfce till the 
gnome guys sort it out.

cheers,
