May be he is talking about their filesystem (JFS2). But linux also have
support to JFS.

It seems(http://www.novell.com/partners/ibm/mainframe/) that the little
dog can take the weight of an Elephant and will make the whale swim
smoothly.

AIX, Solaris have their strengths but so does Linux.
Tell the AIX guy that Linux kernel scales from embedded devices right 
upto IBM Z series mainframes and that IBM employs a good number of 
kernel developers.

You guys definitely have a penchant for such useless political
discussions. ;)

They are not totally useless though. I love politics as well as long as
it leads to an enhanced understanding.

It is only when we mix emotions and lose the technical angle that I get
pissed. 

Anyway I have worked on Solaris and AIX too.

Solaris was good. Boring but nice. 

I didn't have any nasty surprises with it. The kernel was not open
source of course but I never ran into any bug.

All the BSDs are part derived from Solaris and even present day's
audio(4) framework in OpenBSD is based on Solaris. Some parts are
interesting but mostly boring.

I used to have a spare machine to play with and I had FreeBSD installed
in that. I am talking about 2002 and I used to program first in FreeBSD
and then deploy in Solaris. No problems.

I had a brief encounter with AIX. I was definitely unhappy with it. It
is old, broken and stupid like the other IBM stuff.;)

As to linux being a kid, well that is true.

If any of you read the source code of linux and OpenBSD kernel you can
conclude yourself.

But most people cannot read source code. That is the problem.

They go by external appearances and jazz. If that is what you want, then
stick to linux.

But this one takes the cake.

The other day even after telling someone that I was an OpenBSD
enthusiast or something, someone gave me this advice.

"Did you try Ubuntu?"

"No."

"Then you should definitely try it."

I didn't know what to say.

 Linux, Unix are the derivatives of POSIX. They are the rulers of their own
Kingdom. Comparing each is useless thought.

I have worked on AIX for about 3 or 4 years and on IBM Mainframes for
6 months extensively and passively for 3 years. Have worked on Solaris
too, but not extensively. I was never an administrator (even of sorts)
on these m/cs.

I agree that AIX and Mainframes are elephants. Big and bloated.

Speaking of AIX - I found them to be quite reliable physically. It
runs on IBM's own Power PC processors. Some of the parts of the OS
were optimized to work on the Power PC. (I had used a Quad Processor
Box).  We have successfully brought down the dev. server many times.
We once did a "kill -9 -l" or something like that, being root. We had
to physically restart the server (unclean shutdown). It worked
perfectly. It was stable enough - particularly the filesystem. Have
never had problems with that. Just that some one with root access kept
deleting our files though. and yes, we had problems with other teams.
A team from a different city used to do a xlC (IBM's C Compiler)
Compile job that ran for more than  2 hours, making our process
(Websphere) to crawl.

Yes and No. but I agree with you. Most IBM stuff that I have used are HUGE.

> As to linux being a kid, well that is true.

I should also admit here that Linux did feel like a "new kid in the
block".  A lot of things are possible. But is it what is deployed?

-------
When it comes to mainframes - its more of the hardware and the base OS
IMHO. The hardware is made with a lot of redundancy. Multiple cooling
units, multiple power sources, multiple RAMs, totally external - hot
pluggable high performance hard disks, etc... EVERYTHING is
hotpluggable. Be it cooling unit/power unit/ RAM/ hard disk. The one
Z/Series that I saw had two laptops attached  to the door for basic
trouble shooting (two for redundancy). They rarely reboot the monster
- may be once in 5 years or so.

The base OS takes care of these stuff. But the user space can run
anything. One of the POCs in my ex-company was to install 1000 Linux
images on the mainframe while the rest of the company was still using
the Z/OS running on the same hardware. There were atleast 5 different
environments of Z/OS that my team alone was using. A lot of
virtualization goes into it.

having said this, does it make sense to compare an operating system
with a high performance hardware? Ofcourse, Z/Series can run on Linux
as well. You are welcome to buy the hardware and install your own
instances of Linux on that box^H^H^H room.

No. I use "Kubuntu" ;-)

The real advantage I am seeing on the linux is the source code available 
under GPL. In my opinion this is comparable with any of the features...

Yes, both are POSIX compliant but calling them derivates is a bit of a 
stretch.

To the best of my knowledge, "Bell Labs" Unix existed before POSIX.  
POSIX is an IEEE specification not an OS which came about to bring in 
standardization in the Unix variants.

I remember Rhythmbox had a lyrics plugin. No player I know can do audio to

Most players have this support.

Rhythymbox downloads lyrics, or reads it from id3 tags if it can.

Jajuk does a real good job of this too.

And then of course, the mother of all music players, Amarok and its

Yes just now I found the plugin.It displays the lyrics in a separate

please distinguish between 1.  'message recycling' (or thread  
hijacking) where the person starts a new subject on the old thread -  
this is usually because the person is too lazy to create a new  
message and just presses reply, changes subject line and carries on,  
and 2. thread forking which happens very often because several issues  
(uncluding netiquette issues) arise from a post.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

csplit - Split a file into sections determined by Context

Summary: 

Output pieces of FILE separated by PATTERN(s) to files `xx01', 
`xx02',.., and output byte counts of each piece to display. 
PATTERN(s) are Line Number or Regexp.

Examples:

$ csplit myfile 10 40 80 -- 1st file contains 1-9 lines, 2nd 10-39,
                            3rd 40-79 and 4th 80-EOF.

$ csplit myfile 10 10 80 -- Zero length file will be create for the 
                            2nd parameter..

$ csplit -z myfile 10 10 60 -- Same as above. But Zero length file 
                               will NOT created

$ csplit myfile /Midas/ -- Copy upto, but not the matching line and 
                           remaining in 2nd file.

$ csplit myfile /Midas/+6 -- Copy upto the matching line + 5 and 
                             remaining in 2nd file.

$ csplit myfile /Midas/-6 -- Copy upto the matching line - 6 and 
                             remaining in 2nd file.

$ csplit myfile /Midas/ {3} -- Repeat the previous pattern for 3 
                               more times.

$ csplit myfile /Midas/ {*} -- Repeat the previous pattern as many 
                               times as possible.

$ csplit myfile %Midas% -- skip upto, but not the matching line.

    Very True.

  Depends on what he actually means.  I think he is actually speaking about
the Huge metal monsters . Let me explain what i think is this guy saying to
you.  The traditional *nix are all capable of running Huge SMP systems .
While linux is not.

Wait.. don't rip my head off by stating that the worlds top super computers
run GNU/Linux
I know that. but the fact remains that these feats are all acheived by
running them as clusters and not as a single image as with the other *nix
OS.

All I have heard about Linux with image SMP is some thing from SGI but i see
most of the huge implementations of Linux based on clustering. ( correct me
if i am wrong .. i am not an expert on these matters just voicing my
opinion  based on what i have read , worked and heard.)

However this  should not be any reason   for hurt. As the old OS were
supporting what they wanted while Linux was always developed  the way
community wanted it to be. if there is a big need for Huge SMP based
monolithic monster, well i am sure the open source community would have
created it  a long time back.

as far as Elephants, whales and pet dogs are concerned, I would rather have
a pet dog.

They have their own biggest strengths. Linux can not even touch the heights
> of them.


   I don't know about touching some one else's heights, achieving what Linux
has achieved is no mean feat . But if there is still a lot more that needs
to be done, then i am sure that it will be achieved by sticking to the OS
that we all love .



> But he told that "You know only Linux. You never know AIX or Mainframe.
> Know
> them and tell".


   Well That is  a valid argument, but i would have asked a list of the so
called strong points that GNU/Linux could not  even touch !!!

>
>
> How linux is better with other unix systems?


  This will take us down a dangerous slope,  However, many of us know of
Open BSD's reputation with security, and NetBSD's portability. If any thing
The answer given is oft repeated that it is one of choice, made by you.. the
ultimate user..  what ever be the arguments one would put before you say
stating the advantavges of AIX over Linux, i some how find it hard that you
would now switch to AIX!! now  would you???

Todays Hindu Bangalore edition carries an interview with  Jesse James

And what does a self-made man like him think about the Free Software
movement? "Tell me if my metaphor makes sense," he says, as he
proceeds to compare it to a large ball atop a hill which needs an
initial push before it gathers momentum. "I think the movement is
coming of age and is extremely important. Based on sharing of ideas,
it is integral to any innovation and growth," he explains animatedly.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

more -- File perusal filter for viewing

Summary: 

Perusal means the act of reading, especially of reading through or
with care.  More is a filter for paging through text one screenful
at a time. Press `q' to Quit.

Examples:

$ more myfile1 myfile2 -- Show myfile 1 and 2  page by page.

$ more -10 myfile -- Show 10 lines/page.

$ more -d myfile -- Usually more show % of viewed content only at the 
                    bottom. With -d it shows more verbose prompt.

$ more -p -10 myfile -- Don't scroll the output. Just the screen and 
                        display the text.

$ more -c -10 myfile -- Don't scroll.  Instead, paint each screen from
      the top, clearing the remainder of each line as it is displayed.

$ more -s myfile -- Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.

$ more +/Midas myfile -- The +/ option specifies a string that will be 
                         searched for before each file is displayed.

$ more +10 myfile -- Start at line number 10.

$ ls | more -- Show the ls output page by page.

Apart from this command line options, more supports few interactive
commands also. For example

:f -- Show current line number and filename
:n -- Next file
:p -- Previous file

b -- Move Backward
f -- Move Forward
h -- Help
q -- Quit

Space -- Next Page
ENTER -- Next Line

Read: man more

Hey,

People should not be using more(1) any"more". ;)

It is less and less nowadays.

And now that summer is getting over let us switch over from 'more' to
'chai'. (If you dunno Tamil you won't get this joke)

Anyway kidding aside less(1) is much faster and more feature rich than
more. Since it doesn't read the whole file before loading.

Try loading a file in vi/vim and less. Try the log file for instance and
contrast it with the startup time with more.

Not sure if more has backported some of less innovations.

I stopped using more(1) more than 6 years ago.

It can also display percentages, move back one page, half page or few
lines at a time , turn pattern based search on and off and so on.

It is only the really really old UNIX hackers that still are stuck with
more(1).

Anyway enough of my rant.

Not really.  Circa 1986/7, is when I first came across "less"  @ Bell 
Labs on all the Unix systems and started using it.  It became very 
popular amongst all of the "really really old UNIX hackers" (as Girish 
puts it) in a short time.  Nobody used it except for legacy apps that 
needed it for pagination of text output, it was frustrating to go 
through the output given that we were used to "less."

Yes, I accept solaris 10 have powerful ZFS filesystem. But Linux also
supports ZFS filesystem like FUSE/Linux.

Hi,

Can you please tell me any one open source application which will be equivalent to outlook that should display the global address list of Exchange 2007. This would be helpful to me for the migration of openoffice.

Take a look at Mozilla ThunderBird, Zimbra, Evolution.

Try Evolution with exchange plugin, to ease your migration there is a 
win32 version of Evolution.

Dear All,

Recently applied for the BSNL Broadband connection. I like to 
get your suggestions on ADSL modem (with Ethernet + WiFi).

1. Is it good to buy it from BSNL or ext src?
2. If ext src, then which modem and where?
3. Anybody willing sell your modem?

NOTE: Please send your reply to me. Not to the list.

I Have a BSNL connection, a separate modem and a Wireless router. Here
is my view.

Two different device hence the wires make a mess. If there is a physical
cable problem, the BSNL people complain saying the device(wireless)
which I have is causing the problem, so you can expect the same if you
get your own device. Explaining those people and getting support is time
consuming.

How ever it works really well for me ;). Hope this helps.

Rgds,
Siva.

You can edit a file using less... just press ' v ' :-)

the v puts the "less" buffer into the editor of your choice 
vi/emacs/pico etc. (EDITOR variable).  Editing capability referenced 
above is within the "less" tool itself.

Two other useful variables that you can set are:

LESS=-Misc
PAGER=less

"less" will use the options (in my case -M -i -s -c) as set in the LESS 
variable.

Many apps use whatever the PAGER variable is set to, for paginating 
their output.

Message-ID: <3f2beab60806030547u358c336bu7248eb5cbb874656@mail.gmail.com>

It is time of Open Letters, this time it is from Dr Deepak Phatak of IIT Bombay.

"With reference to the recent happenings in connection with the ISO
standardization process of OOXML, actions by or on behalf of Microsoft
have caused me deep pain and hurt. Apart from the personal anguish,
these actions have tarnished the name of my Institute along with that
of several other organizations represented on our committee. In my
opinion, these actions go well beyond the behavioral boundaries for a
commercial entity. some of these amount to interference with the
governance process of a sovereign country. Luckily, wiser and
experienced people are in-charge of governance of the nation. However,
as a humble teacher and a proud Indian, I wish to register a strong
and visible protest."

It is a really long post, but surely worth reading. It will give you
an insight into a real and personal experience by a professor in one
of the most respected instituitions of our country.

Hi,

        If you use less, there are ways you can change its
 behaviour. For example, what follows is in my zsh  init files:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
LESS="-cisFRXMWP?f%f :std in .?n?m(file %i of %m) ..?ltline %lt :byte %bB?s/%s ..?e(END) ?x- Next\: %x.:?pB%pB\%..%t"
export LESS
export LESSCHARSET=utf-8
--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

        The meaning of the LESS variable options is left as an exercise
 for the reader :-)

        Oh, and this allows me, for example, to do less xyz.deb, or
 abc.rpm and examine the package file nicely with less:

I would be very much interested , if someone could also share some
experiences in deploying applications across these machines?
Lets say, i develop an application on Linux (C/Cpp/Python) and try to build
the same on these machines - what kind of integration or platform specific
issues can i anticipate during development?

Some modems allow you to connect them through ethernet and they behave
just like routers. That kind of a device should work with all versions
of Linux. Maybe you should consider avoiding ones with only USB
support.

I was told that the wait for the modem with wi-fi was a lot more so I
opted for just the modem from BSNL and bought the wi-fi router separately.

The modem seems to work fine (except for the USB port which I didn't
need and haven't got working).

> NOTE: Please send your reply to me. Not to the list.

Since many people refused to comply with this request so have I!

Reason: It is good to be on-topic but I don't think that this is too
far out-of-topic.

A useful forum is broadbandforum.in and the wiki.

Kapil.

I think adding an editor to "less" would lead to un-needed bloat.
Having one's own familiar editor while editing files is a great boon.
Each application with its own quirky and un-familiar editor is a
pain.

Here are some alternatives:

 1. Use the 'v' command in "less" to push the file to *real* editor.
 You can use the emacs server mode so that the editing task is pushed
 to an already running emacs. 

 2. Reverse things and use the 'view-file' mode of your editor to view
 the file instead of less. For example, in vi-like editors you can use
 the view command. In emacs you can set the buffer to read-only or
 use a mode that runs a viewer like w3m inside emacs. I think "vim"
 has a less emulation mode as well.

Regards,

Kapil.

One more related info is, you would be able to access the BSNL modem
console via http://192.168.1.10 (as like a router)

Today the usage of 'less' is more and usage of 'more' is less. The
functionality of 'more' and 'less' is more or less same. But 'less'
provides more options/features then 'more'.

Hi All,

Thanks for the reply. I got mixed response about the Modem, 
perticularly about WiFi.

Suggections:

1. Go for the Type I (just Ethernet) modem and add your 
own WiFi router with that. 

2. If you have the own modem then service people will simply say it 
your device issue and Esc.

3.

thanks Kapil - very good suggestions - I would like to avoid a direct vi on
a BIG text file as vi likes to load the whole file into memory - this is not
only time consuming - but also not easy on RAM - and if someone forgets to
close the vi session  - i suspect the mempry will not be free()d  -- I
expect the same with view -- where as less and 'v' suggested on the list - i
think only the portion of text is passed by less to vi

Don't know what policies the various vendors follow.  In the DLink 502T 
that I got from MTNL, on the WAN port, all services were turned ON in 
the original firmware.  In the second rev. their developers woke up and 
turned the services OFF.

It is better to be safe than sorry - takes a few mins. longer in the 
setup.

Dear Fedora users

Fedora-9 Everything Repository has nearly 9800+ packages (more than 12 GB) overall and I have
created a PDF version of repoview page found in the fedoraproject website.

http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/releases/9/Everything/i386/os/repoview/

I hope this would be useful for fedora users to have a handy printout when looking 
for  required packages, which is also properly organised in groups.

The link is:

Hi,

I am on a visit to US right now. I was using AirTel calling cards to
call home. The calling cards are available at
https://www.airtelcallhome.com

 It has started throwing a javascript alert message stating "Please
use Internet Explorer for this site." I couldnt finish the transaction
through Firefox but succeeded in Opera. Fine happy? Not really. It
sends the user id and password in the URL - as a Query String. I
really don't know if these guys have any kind of QC or not.

PS: I have added this to the Delhi LUG - Hall of Shame.

This is the story on many Indian sites including Govt. e-Portals.  They 
just don't seem to get it inspite of giving feedback.

The worst part is that the clients (Airtel in this case) accept such 
shoddy work from their vendors.  It makes one wonder how we call 
ourselves the "IT powerhouse" when a good majority of our IT folks 
don't have a clue about the fundamentals.

Any stats how many eyeballs see this URL,  I suspect the people who

tr - TRanslate or Delete characters

Summary: 

tr will translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from stdin,
writing to stdout. 'tr' supports few standard Esc sequences, regular
expressions, char classes (lower, upper, space, blank, alpha ...),
etc.

Examples:

$ echo "tenet" | tr "tn" "TN" -- Translate t to T & n to N.

$ echo "ilugc" | tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]" -- Change case (lower to upper)

$ echo "ilugc" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' -- Same as above.

$ echo "HelloooOOOoooo" | tr -s '[:lower:]' -- Squeeze the "lower" 
                                               case letters.

$ echo "IwLxUyGzC" | tr -d xyz -- Remove xyz

$ cat myfile | tr -s '\n' -- Remove repeated new lines.

$ echo "ABCDEFG" | tr -c "ACEG" "\n" -- Expect "ACEG" translate 
                                        others to newline char.

May be you dont have addons to support tamil font .Firefox has plenty of
addons to support Tamil font , one among them is padma .Install padma or
something and restart your browser

I think this was resolved using a newer pango library about one year
or so ago. 

So your only option would seem to be to get a newer pango library and
probably a newer firefox.

Please test the page using a new-ish Live CD for ubuntu or use a
chroot with a new firefox. If that works then you have to decide how
to upgrade.

Regards,

Kapil.

Hi,
 
Balaji will write a more detailed report . He wrote a quick thing as he
is travelling

"After several attempts I couldn't get hold of a camera and couldn't get
the photo of the session. But, here is what I have say about the
session.

Abhas started at around 2:35pm and discussion went on till 4pm till we
are thrown out of the room. So, it went on very interactively .

Abhas went through users perspective and developers perspective of free
software and built the argument slowly on why software business should
be on free software and we should have more such companies in this
country. He also mentioned about the success of Deeproot and how
Deeproot operates with Free software.


Abhas,

Can you share your presentation that you used with us? People at Sun
also asked for it."

Well, I who pointed out this problem and you the one who is
identifying have got it right. Isn't it? Its just that there are many
who haven't got it right. I agree. But there are a lot who have got it
right. The difference is that the number of people who have got it
right. I am right now in the US and I have been to Europe earlier. I
can say out of personal experience that, we guys are much better off.
The westerners might do things more "professionally". It doesn't mean
that they can do it any better. People in the service industry are
always bogged down by budget and schedule and taking quality to a back
seat.

(This is going way off topic. Sorry for tread-jacking. Will stop here.)

What about bazaar? I've heard lots of great stories about it. I remember
Andrew Cowie (AfC), claiming it's like git, only accessible to

If you want a centralized version control system, SVN would be your best option.
Or if you prefer a decentralized/distributed system, I would say, go for git.

My personal preference is svn+svk.. so everybody is happy: those who
want centralized can use svn directly, and those who want
decentralized (like me) can use svk.

svk can get pretty slow once the number of commits becomes large. :(

I haven't worked with git or mtn or bazaar, so can't really compare.

Occassionally I receive emails, that display nothing (blank) in the

I have also seen this anamoly in messages from the Pune ILUG and the

I am a member of other lists that are served by Mailman but not seen 
this anamoly on those list servers.

Anyone else experiencing the same?  Can someone figure out why this is

We use darcs at work.  It's pretty good, quick, easy, doesn't get in
your way.  Easy enough that I do a 'darcs init' each time I create a
new directory with code in it. :)

I hear you, there is a project I use svk for, and with 100k commits now 
in the backend, its becoming a pain.

while most people would get major wins from svk, you cant really replace 
git or bazaar with it. For one, svk wont let you do local repo 
management like git does and wont let you do repo forking etc that is 
pretty much the central point of git/bazaar.

Having said that - I think mercurial is the best distributed system out 
there at the moment. The best bang-for-the-buck if you will.

Hello,

VCS wars^Wdiscussions!

I have worked with svn (in fact my Debian packages are in
svn.debian.org). However, of late, I have found the following
workflow using git and git-svn easier to handle.

0. I used git-svn _once_ to clone the repository from svn.debian.org
   This takes a long time so it is best to do it once only!

1. I use git to do actual development work. This allows me to work on
   topic branches merge etc. I have found git convenient even for
   single-user work! (E.g. offline commits, colorized info screens)

2. I use git-svn to fetch/dcommit once I have a clean-ish branch that
   needs to go to the repository.

3. I use "svn copy" to create new svn branches or svn tags.

I wish (3) could be avoided and git-svn would handle this too.

I believe this is easier than using svk with svn.

The reasons for using svn.debian.org instead of git.debian.org are that
I'm too lazy to migrate the existing repository which was created
when I learnt svn.

If one is starting a fresh repository then I would skip the svn part
altogether and just go with git.

Mercurial looks fine for this kind of work as well but there is no
hg-svn tool and tailor didn't work well enough for me.

In any case, you need to play a _lot_ (in a toy-mode) with a VCS
before adopting it.

It is best that you learn on a toy repository how to back out of bad
commits and messed up trees.  Doing that on a live repository can be
nerve-wracking _and_ expose your ignorance to all those who look at
the history! In this too git is kinder than svn.

Regards,

Kapil.

+1 for svn and git-svn. People who want to use a centralized
+system can use SVN, while the braver folks can have the
+convenience of git.

Because xargs(1) is a weird command to use.

But then I don't think there is an alternative.

The usage semantics always confuse me.

I can scarcely remember it. But it is far easier than using the find
builtin mechanisms to achieve the same end.

I think you are missing some switch of xargs.

Because they are not identical!

The first takes the white-space separated words from standard input
and assigns them as ARG1, ARG2, ....
and runs foo with _all_ these arguments.

The second takes _each_ white-space separated word from standard
input and runs foo with ARG1 set to that word.

Just to get the pipeline out of the way do the following
	ls / > /tmp/list
This produces a file with one file name on each line.

(Note below that the default command run by xargs is "echo")

Then run
	xarg -a /tmp/list
this produces the entire list on one line (which will be wrapped
around if your terminal is set to wrap mode).

On the other hand 
	xarg -a /tmp/list -i \{\}
produces a copy of /tmp/list

Eureka! I scanned the man page again and found a switch "-l" which forces
each input argument to be processed separately. Therefore, it is

    xargs -l foo

that is equivalent to

    xargs -i foo {}

Now onwards, I will always use "-l" with XArgs. Isn't XArgs the greatest
command on Unix!!

Be careful. The man page also says:

	The -l option is deprecated since the POSIX  standard
	specifies -L instead.

So it may be better to use

	xargs -L 1 foo

Message-ID: <dd680c2b0806071103q5b70d909s11fd84d63ea88a0c@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

How to copy a VCD to another empty disc?

i can not create dd dump or iso.
it shows errors.

Input/Output error
unable to read etc.

the bug in
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.17/+bug/82307
is still not fixed.

even I can not play it.

Recently I got a project to copy a VCD to 600 discs.

Tried my best, but at last dropped that project and outsourced to the
windows friends.


Is there any way to copy VCDs in linux?

You should not (and perhaps cannot) use dd to dump a CD.

There are (at least) two ways CD's are written --- tracks and packets.

The former can be read and written by "cdrecord" tools which have now
been forked into the "wodim" tools; there is also the "cdrdao" tool
which reads and writes tracks.

The packet mode is used by "udftools". That is the typical format for
film DVD's.

As far as I know these tools do not really "care" what type of data
is read or written on the tracks or packets.

There are specialized tools for copying raw audio CDs, VCDs, Movie DVDs,
raw DVDs and so on.

I have used rippers like cdparanoia, dagrab and so on for audio CDs.
There is a tool called jack in Debian for the same.

Then for VCD, I simply use mplayer. ;)

Ditto for DVD ripping.

$ mplayer vcd:// -dumpstream -dumpfile foo.img

and

$ mplayer dvd:// -dumpstream -dumpfile foo.img

This has always worked.

Then in BSD there is readcd(1) and cdio(1) I think only in OpenBSD which
can also do part of the job.

And there are tools by name streamdvd and dvdbackup which probably
understand the DVD chapters and help you save some of the chapters and
so on.

You should remember that dd(1) is great but you are better off using
specialized tools since you save time and disk space.

For instance I used to create USB stick images with dd(1). But I can now
use dump(1) and restore(1) which understands FFS filesystem semantics.

So I don't end up copying raw unused sectors. Only those that are
utilized in a file system.

For an example, if I have only 3 MB worth data in a 1 TB file system,
with dd(1) you have to copy the entire  1 TB whereas with dump you copy
only 3 MB.

No, I don't have a 1 TB disk yet. I am told it is around 9.3k in Delta.
;)

Of course I am talking about SATA Seagate.

Message-ID: <be9339530806072327x516193aatae14b8293dd7b13@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings to all,

This is a formal announcement about the creation of a new IRC channel,
#hackers-india on the Freenode IRC network.
The channel has been started to fill the void of a pure
hackery-codery-programming based Indian channel. The need for such a
channel was felt by me (and a couple of other hackers) during the
programming discussions held on ##linux-india. We are hoping that the
channel will go a long way in helping hackers around India during
need-of-the-hour, as well as future summer-of-codes, hackathons,
codefests etc.

Some other details:
  - Purely white-hat channel, no cracking paid softwares, warez talks;
AT ALL (read: instant permanent ban)
  - There is not restriction on programming language or even OS (yes,
Windows users welcome :-)
  - Discussions falling under the categories of network/machine
security, penetration testing etc. may be held on #security-india
(also on Freenode, pre-existing channel)


Feel free to post this mail to any other related list/website you
might subscribe to.
Thanks!
Pratul (aka lut4rp)

These are automated invitations and the Facebook folks force you to
give them your GMail password and flood everyone with invites. They
promise to resepct your privacy, though.

After hearing Andrew Cowie at FOSS.IN, I left Facebook and Orkut. I
recommend that all Facebook users review the Facebook license
agreement. IIUC, they maintain the right to use your information as
they please and even to disclose all your "private" messages to public
domain. AfC recommended that all FOSS supporters should avoid such
things where you don't have the real "freedom". GMail was one of them,
but that waits till I get my own domain name :-)

Maybe you should consider this. I didn't lose much signing off from
Facebook - I only gained more time to spend on more useful things.

Akarsh

this is a problem that is not going to go away easily. gmail, yahoo or even your own domain name and the mail id that comes with it are all open to subpoena. even if you have a mailid@yourhost.com you still need to encrypt your data and send it to the recipient. if the recipient does not have the decryption key, there is no way to decrypt it. 
   so, you need to shared the decryption key with the recipient securely. that pretty much means that you cannot communicate securely anything with a person whom you are having first contact. There is infrastructure in place such as key distribution centers to get over this. But the moment we have anything adequately big as an infrastructure, its open to subpoena.

  I don't see why gmail should be seen as evil if they are willing to release account information on subpoena. without it, they are not even permitted to operate in the country.

##li has been in existence for the past 4 years - and is the *only*  
pan India foss body. It is perfectly hacker friendly and is slowly  
growing. I do not like people who create FUD about the channel and  
plaster mailing lists with announcements like this. Sure, go ahead  
and create your own channel - but do it without spreading FUD. So it  
is cool that so-called hackers leave.

I think you missed some other points which are still bad.

This in itself is bad.

The basic issue is that of controlling your own data in unequal
relationships.

All these are community built sites --- without the large community of
users they would be nothing. This even applies to gmail.

So it is wrong to think (as many people do) that they are providing a
"free" service. Their service is built out of the large number of people
who have invested their time and data into it.

The contract between them and the users is that they say "we will not
use your data in a bad way"; and so far they seem to have abided by
that contract in the view of most of their users.

However, it _is_ an unequal relationship. As soon as you loose
connectivity to the service, they have your data and you have ...
nothing! That is, unless you regularly backup all _your_ data from
gmail to a local disk.

Regards,

Kapil.

Yes, I think that is an important point. GMail will not remain Beta /
free forever. At the end of their Beta testing, when they move GMail
to a commercial venture (which I think they will), they could, in
principle, make you pay to get back your own data.

Message-ID: <C1F024B2AFA0CE4CB8E93810BD9CAA54051C2D63@xmb-blr-414.apac.cisco.com>

To add few more lines to the previous mail,
 The session talked about the business model also.
 Money can be earned using free software by charging for the services,
making maintenance contracts, customization, localization & upgrades.
Abhas mentioned an important business point in the model where we need
to be careful about is that maintenance contract should be for the
released version of the software and should not cover the defects due to
additional changes made by the customer to the software.

and it is about free to use, free to distribute and free to modify by
the consumer.

Hi  all !

Hello everyone,

Would like to announce the initial release of Freemap Mobile, a Java ME
mapping application for mobile devices. Freemap Mobile displays Freemap
maps (i.e. UK countryside-orientated OSM maps) on a GPS enabled mobile
phone (e.g. Nokia N95) and the source code is now available in OSM SVN at
applications/mobile/FreemapMobile. Alternatively the JAR/JAD files are
available for download at

http://www.free-map.org.uk/downloads/FreemapMobile/

Obviously with this being the initial release it's pretty basic at the
moment, but will nonetheless show a Freemap map of your current location
and has two zoom levels (Google zoom levels 14 and 16). It downloads tiles
from the server on-demand and then caches them in the record store to
avoid the need to download the map next time.  It generally works though
occasionally seem to get the odd glitch downloading tiles - need to
investigate this further.

Since Freemap only has coverage in certain areas of the UK, due to server
limitations (approximately the counties Hampshire, Sussex, Surrey, Isle of
Wight, Dorset, Wiltshire, the Bath area of Somerset, Berkshire,
Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Warwickshire,
Gloucestershire, Staffordshire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, north Wales,
Lancashire and Cumbria) you won't get a map anywhere by default. However,
it's my intention to allow configuration of the map source so that it can
view standard OSM Mapnik and osmarender maps too. At the moment this isn't
implemented, however if you know Java you can change the tile source URL
in line 22 of TileSource.java.

Many more features are planned including points of interest, and the
ability to report path problems/interesting views and create annotated
photos for direction finding. The intention is to provide a countryside
orientated navigation tool, however the code base could be used to create
an urban OSM mapping/surveying tool with similar features.

Obviously use at your own risk, I won't take responsibility if it messes
up your phone! Licence is mixture of GPL / LGPL.

Nick

Hi,
In Linux / unix, when I tried to type @ character, it is either
taking/consider as ^c OR backspace.
Say for example when I try to login to oracle using with @ char in it, I
am not able to able to.

Tried googling for help. Also, tried to set different terminal types like
export TERM=dtterm etc like stuffs. Nothing worked.

Any hints regarding this would help.

Hi Bharathi
Thank you for the quick response.

KB layout is standard US layout.
It happened in C Shell and Kornshell. Happened in AIX as well as Caldera
Linux in command line in normal terminal emulator putty as well as in
x-windows(xterm). I could not try in other stuff.

That doesn't sound very healthy for anyone.  I don't think it would be a good move from google's side. if google screws everyone, everyone screws google.  but i don't know how business can work and it may turn in their favor.

     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That is certainly not true. Since there is a mukta O/S and a mukta
network to connect to we do have a choice and we can exercise it.

Answer:

You can at least do this. Backup your data. It _is_ your data and
external USB storage is not too expensive. Incremental backup does
not use too much bandwidth. Write some pipe or plugin to do this and
make it a floss project.

To violate freedom, Google or any other "public service" provider does
not need to turn the screws on everyone; they need to do it only to a
few people. Let me explain with examples.

1. There are many more MS users (at least one order of magnitude) who
exchange documents and e-mail than non-MS users. So MS _can_ and
_does_ make life difficult for all non-MS users by using proprietary
and undocumented formats for documents. Don't even get me started on
"IE-only" web sites!

2. Blu-ray is a technology currently not supported (AFAIK) on FLOSS
platforms. Suppose that data distributors tomorrow decided to support
only Blu-ray since _most_ users do not use FLOSS?

In both cases, the majority of users are not affected. Only the
"eccentric few"! So it is important that we support freedom for
_everyone_, not just for the majority of users.

Some other solutions:

A. It is possible to setup pooled community servers and services. I read
about a group called SAGE (Australian System Administrator's
Group?)[1] which does this.

B. Avoid monopolies. If your friend uses Gmail then insist on using
Yahoo! and complain loudly if the two services do not co-operate.
More choice is mostly better!

Other people on this list might come up with more suggestions.

Regards,

Kapil.

[1] Not to be confused with the free mathematical computation package
called SAGE.

Yes, thats the first step. To truly exercise freedom, we require others to be free because we live in a society of dependence. Hence we still need the numbers.

There is a need to produce programs with extremely simple user interface for non-tech folks who use the computer. More importantly they cannot be ignored. From a security stand point, our security is as good as its weakest link, the non-tech user.

 From an OS stand point, Microsoft windows is extremely easy to navigate for a non-tech user. Our free OS is not still there yet.


>>>You can at least do this. Backup your data. It _is_ your data and

that is a good foss project idea. there apparently is something on that lines
http://code.google.com/p/gmail-backup/


>>>B. Avoid monopolies. If your friend uses Gmail then insist on using

Its designed not to work. All the 'free extra services' can be exercised only if you stick to one of them. Using two different services for the same thing now becomes grossly inconvenient.

Sarad.

I sell network appliances running open source software.

However I am told that companies need certified appliances for surviving

Apparently firewalls like Fortigate already have certification. How do I

Will it cost a lot of money and take a long time?

Sorry for the duplicate mail. My mail client Evolution, suddenly
decided to lose its head, and mail it instead of saving the draft via
IMAP. I just switched to Evolution recently from Thunderbird, and am
noticing this for the first time.

My apologies to all.

I kind of disagree with that statement. I do not wish to flare your
temper, or start a flame war, but there is a lot that goes into what
you learn, and how you are brought up. I started using Linux only a
couple of years ago, and now I must say I am pretty comfortable. The
problem with most kids these days is that the first computer they see
has Win installed. They get used to it, and settle down, often for
several years. (10+ in my case). Now, when they face an environment
like Gnome, they are thrown off their comfort zone - there is no
"start bar", no "Control Panel", etc..

These things often settle into the mind of the use so much that they
tend to become the universal default. My mom was asking me why there
is no "notepad" on my Linux Box. Rather than explain out all the
details, I rebooted in Win.

The point I am trying to make here is the way kids are brought up. If
you show them a Linux System say with Gnome, and tell them this is
what a computer is - what they have at school are computers too, but
different ones, they learn to get used to the idea of mutiple Desktop
environments.

Several schools in Russia are introducing kids to Linux, and teaching
them python as their first programming language around grade 4. I
think it is a great move.

It is purely a matter of convenience.

Hi Girish,

      Ofcourse you will require a compliance Certification from the
authorities.But there are so many classifications based on the usage of the
appliance.. Example, if your appliance providing data security for Credit
Cards, you will have to get the Payment Card Industries ( PCI)
certification. That means its assurance to the customers that your appliance
is following the standards of PCI.. You can go for ISO also.. it depends
upon the nature and purpose of your appliance.

*Thanks and Regards
Gilbert Raja

I guess it is worth the effort explaining. It's just that users need
to inculcate an openness to change. IMO, it helps everywhere, because
technology is ever changing. After playing around a bit with Windows
3.1, I was suddenly confronted with a desktop running Windows 95! I
would've been stupid to say 'Where is the program manager? This is so
different! Remove this stuff at once and put back my beloved Windows
3.1'!

s/kids/first time computer users/

Yes. And it looks like this is the trick that Microsoft is adopting to
check the growth of Linux. IMHO, all these 'Social welfare campaigns'
supported by Microsoft, by providing free copies of Windows to run on
kiosks set up in rural villages are actually monopolizing campaigns to
target people who see computers for the first time. 20 years later,
when every villager in India will probably have a computer, he'd
obviously be inclined to using Windows because that's what he saw
first.

I think l10n and i18n for FOSS projects should be given attention to,
because people in rural India are more comfortable with their mother
tongues!

Yes, indeed.

It's more a matter of choice. I prefer free software by choice,
convenient or not.

AFAIK, Microsoft never gives *free* Windows to anyone, even when it 
donates *technology*. What they do is give *free* hardware, which comes 
with their proprietary operating system mostly a trial version of 90 
days or so, and make them pay for the license afterwards.

I believe you are selling security appliances based on open source 
software.  Most of the security products in the market are certified by 
NCSA <http://security.ncsa.uiuc.edu/> and perhaps other agencies.

You know best what your product does and who your competitors are.  I 
would suggest that you visit the web sites of your competitors and I am 
sure they have a list of all the certifications that their products 
comply with.

OR hold back part of the "donated" money, upfront, towards license cost.  
IIRC that's what they did when they settled the anti trust case with 
the US Dept. of Justice.  Additionally, the string attached with the 
donated hardware is that they can run MS Windows only.  The beneficiary 
cannot install another hard disk and make it dual/multi boot with some 
other OS.

A lot of things appear to be inconvenient until one tries them out!

Look at what someone else said.

The cost of freedom is that you need to exercise your choices.

Occasionally, this means giving up temporary conveniences.

To come to the example at hand. Suppose everyone decides to go with   
gmail and googlegroups. Suppose that this causes Yahoo! to fold up
its e-mail services and so on. Suddenly, it becomes practical _and_
profitable for Google to start exercising its monopoly![1][2]

Accepting the temporary incovenience of connecting to the 'net
with slirp and a reduced capability network stack, allowed us to
setup mail services in 1992-93 at School of Maths, TIFR using
GNU/Linux. Thanks to Pablo Ares Gastesi that is now a full-fledged
LAN running GNU/Linux. (See http://www.math.tifr.res.in).

Luckily for us all, his effort to circumvent the inconvenience was
not the only one but was replicated a thousand times over across the
world. As a result, circa 2000 it became more *convenient* to set up
basic services (DNS,mail,web,...) using GNU/Linux or *BSD than
with any of the proprietary systems.

So if one believes that Web 2.0 or network-based shared-resource
computing is the way of the future then the time is ripe to:
 (a) ensure interoperability of the proprietary providers
 and
 (b) setup (or provide software resources to setup) community
     supported service providers
This may be a bit inconvenient in the short term but will benefit
everyone in the long term. Example: Open Street Maps!

Regards,

Kapil.

[1] This is not specific to Google. If the roles of Google and Yahoo!
were interchanged, this would not really change the story.

[2] In fact, Linux users should be happy that there is
FreeBSD/OpenBSD which can throw up different (and sometimes better!)
ways of doing the same thing. Thus Linux is not allowed to be a monopoly
either. :-)

You are a tech. user. A fair experiment would be to pick a sample of non-tech users and introduce them to both linux and windows and see what they prefer to use. You have a valid point. People are/were brought up using windows. it is going to be difficult to break the vicious circle, though not impossible.

Yes, the difficulty here is choice :-) they also have windows to choose from.


>>It is purely a matter of convenience.

which is very important. if companies can train their staff to use windows 5 days to teach task x and 7 days to teach the same thing , what do we expect them to use? clearly more days spent is more money spent on training.

As for monopoly, it is some times good and some times bad. had it not been for Windows 95 it would have been very hard for computers to reach the vast majority of present users. the internet would have grown slower, software development would not have picked up the current rate. look at the number of copies windows 95 sold. look at the number of copies they are still selling. they have these numbers because they have takers.

Now, since there are enough players, is it time for the monopoly to end? :-)

Cheers,
Sarad.

Well said. it's true. however, all of us like our food served on a platter. Given the choice, most folks pick the 'easy way'. The problem is that we pay for their bad choices because of our relation and dependency with society. the other problem is choice, they can pick what they want irrespective of what you choose.

I think we are talking two different things here. i am referring to the non-tech community using computers, the need for better GUI's to get them to use linux and their importance to the computer community.

you seem to be referring to the tech community. there is no doubt that linux has better scientific packages, better network management tools,...and an endless list of better than windows packages.

I agree but feel that there are too many "given wisdom" statements in
what Sarad AV has said to let them pass. My apologies for fanning the
flames. ;-)

If you want to skip the rest of this mail then the pithy summary is:

 Monopolies are born out of perceived _convenience_
 		or
 _Convenience_ is the always wrong reason to accept less choice
 
(Or less security). I assure you that the rest of this mail is not
(only) ideology _and_ has something to do with GNU and Linux!

Do you know how the MS monopoly started? The following is how I
personally experienced it and remember it.

In the 80's and early 90's, MS was not the monopoly that it is today.

The proprietary *nix companies were "not evil". The management of
these companies decided that:

 a. free software was bad for them
 b. commodity hardware would never be any good
 c. competition meant that they should diverge from each other

The users of these proprietary *nices found it _convenient_ to just
play along --- so you had Solaris networks, HP/UX networks, AIX
networks and so on. All based on proprietary mutually incompatible
hardware. Quite often there were software incompatibilities as
well. These users (which were well-funded government and institutional
labs) depended on the paid-for support from these companies, which was
generally quite good --- at least until the late 90's.

Those who played along with this "convenience" helped create the
MS monopoly. In the late 90's it started to became hard for these
companies to find well-trained support staff. All the small computer
labs were by then running MS; most of the job applicants had been trained
in these labs. Or if the job applicants had studied in an HP/UX
network it was not easy for them to learn to maintain Solaris or vice
versa. At that point the users who had created a Solaris network were
caught between a rock and a hard place; let the network be handled by
incompetent people or pay top-dollar for the few trained professionals
who were smart enough to work with any system.

Many of these labs then fell into MS's lap! I won't name names...

Did these labs have a choice? Of course, they did! They could have
taken the slightly less convenient path of installing GNU/Linux and
creating a network based on that and the cheap commodity hardware
that it worked on. Moreover, if enough of these labs had done this
there would not have been the shortage of trained *nix professionals
that started in the late 90's.

Remember that Linux (or GNU) was not written to dethrone MS. Linux
was written so that its users could use a smoothly working *nix on
cheap commodity hardware. GNU was written so that its users could
conveniently and legally share code across different *nix platforms.

Hereendeththelessen,

Kapil.

    Not  necessarily. But when you are a  startup it helps  to  have a
certification.
    since you are trying to sell network related appliances , Certifications
like NEBS  might be looked after , but these are  very costly. u will be
much better doing simple compatibility matrices.

Please think about the following questions in your own context.

 Were _you_ ever a "non-tech" user? If so, how and when did you become
 a "tech" user? What would you need to do to become a "non-tech" user
 again?

I believe that the answer to these questions will explain my point of
view.

As Albus Dumbledore (echoing the wisdom of the ancients[1]) says to Harry
Potter:

	It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far
	more than our abilities.

Hello,


This has lost making sense to me. i was advising a simple statistical experiment to get an estimate of non-tech users preference of a win os over linux or vice versa.

In a statistical experiment to find the average height of men and women of different age groups, should i be asking myself the following questions
1. am i short?
2. when did i become tall? if so, how?

I think these questions are certainly not in the right direction in the context of what i am referring to.

Sarad.

Message-ID: <5CF6BEFC-291B-4F9C-81F5-E7EEAF639F20@thenilgiris.com>

hi,
Sandip Saini of NRC-FOSS is doing his PhD in a study of foss  
methodologies. As part of his work, he is trying to compile a set of  
FOSS success stories. Definition:

<quote>
Documenting the success stories of FOSS implementation in India--
Nature, Scope and Methodology of the study.

The goal of the study is to bring out into public a reliable and
independent compilation of some instances where FOSS implementation has
been carried out successfully in India.
           A 'success' in this context is defined as one where there has
been an acceptance of at least one FOSS  technology or solution
across at least one unit of organisation ? a department, a
project, an enterprise or  an institution ? either public or
private, either IT or non-IT. In other words, an individual who
uses only FOSS for his/her needs would not qualify for being
considered a success in this context; it has to be an
organisational entity/unit. The best case would be where an
entire large enterprise (a government department say like Indian
Railways, a private corporation like an IT major or an
Automobile manufacturing company, etc) has completely switched
over to FOSS for all its IT and Computing needs, and the least
acceptable instance would that of a small unit of an enterprise
(one department of a University, one section of a company or
government organisation,etc) that have started  using mainly
FOSS for at least one significant part of its operations. All
instances between these two limiting cases would of course be
acceptable too.
</quote>

We would be happy if members of these lists could suggest places he  
could investigate. You may contact him at:
sksaini@au-kbc.org

also feel free to post such things in this list.

Great to see an excellent list of tech talks, they all sound
interesting and I want to hear them all.  But don't you think
it's a little too much for a single day/session?

IIRC whenever we had > 2 tech talks in a single session,

Some minor corrections here.

I maintain plenty of OpenBSD ports equivalent to Debian packages. As to
my patches, well once they are committed every OpenBSD dev maintains it.
;)

I am going to demonstrate my appliance which is technically known as
"service redirector".

I have named it 'ravanan' for want of a better name. ;)

I shall give a short intro to routing since the service redirector/load
balancer works with sophisticated layer III redirection.

Moreover I shall be discussing some of the very interesting experiences
I had in a recent live product deployment of mine. I won't be demonstrating
that product unfortunately since it is an antispam appliance. ;)

Anyway see you all soon.

Adding some noise, I agree with Raja here. I guess, we should have 2
talks next month meet. And also given that, I might not be attending
this meet, I would like atleast the Debian talk to be postponed ;-)

Subject: [Ilugc] PHP content management
Message-ID: <3c52da3c0806101111o7968306bq84d4935b48d306a5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We have a PHP app [1] which runs a programming contest judge. Now a
programming contest judge has a lot of data (problem statements,
testdata etc.)

The way we handle that currently is that we have a directory full of
the content on the filesystem itself... so to get a problem statement
for problem ABC, I'd access a file data/problems/ABC.html on the
filesystem.

Now, from what I've read, what I'm trying to achieve is something what
a content management system is supposed to do... right? My app is
fully functional right now, and I can't afford to remodel the entire
thing on top of some CMS.

What I would like is some content management system that allows me to
modify these contents, but I should be able to access these content
from my other PHP app using some APIs. For example, I should be able
to edit data/problems/ABC.html wiki style (I am ready to sacrifice my
dependence on the filesystem, I can always store the data in a
database if the solution requires it), and I should be able to
retrieve the contents using some API the CMS provides: like
get_contents("data/problems/A.html"); I should also be able to upload
files like images etc.

I also need concepts of ownership built in, within this CMS itself
there should be a root user, and each page needs to be owned by an
owner (or a set of owners). Even better (though not strictly
necessary), I should be able to use my existing usernames and
passwords.

I haven't used a CMS before, so I might have been wrong in my usage of
the term :)

Anyway, can anyone give me suggestions as to what I should be doing/using?

Thanks,
--Arnold

No way. Bcoz before the next month meet, Kumar will be @ Univ of Texas

Apart from this, Porting talk was decided in the last meet itself and
Mr Luis availability on next month is also doubtful. And I don't want 
to miss the opportunity :)

Actually, I volunteer to withdraw my talk. I'll attend the meet though.

Though I have no clue about the error, for getting back data
use a live cd like knoppix or use fc2- first cd and go into rescue mode,
mount the partition and copy data over the network .

May the filesystem in the partition is corrupt, try running fsck after backup.

I do not know what is in the book but my experience at Chennai US consulate says
the executives doing the VISA interview seem to give importance to
degree and what degree.

In the counter next to me, I clearly heard someone being loudly told
"You are not academically qualified"
It even turned out to be  fraudulent. Someone with B.COM degree, some
certificate from NIIT with fake
papers. poor guy!

Not exactly true. I hold a B.A in English Literature. I haven't collected my
college degree yet. So, no papers. I got a US visa and the interview lasted
about a minute. I don't know if the officer was lax, but I got my visa.

Subject: [Ilugc] GRUB error 18! Please help!
Message-ID: <000901c8cbcd$e70f8f70$0201a8c0@srinivas858c6f>

Hi All

I have a problem.

My system specs are P III Celeron 900MHz,256 MB RAM, 80 GB HDD on 

Primary master, 40 GB on Primary slave, DVD ROM-Secondary slave, 

DVD-Writer Secondary master.

In 80 GB Primary master, Win XP and Debian 4.0 are installed in
separate partitions (hda1,5,6,7 for windows, hda8 for debian).
In 40 GB Primary slave windows accessible partitions were there
and in hdb7, earlier mandrake was there and Ubuntu 7.04 was installed
later and the GRUB of Ubuntu (installed in MBR of first HDD)took care 

of all the 3 OS's and I was happily booting into all the 3 OS's at 

will.

Then I installed/upgraded Ubuntu 7.10 and then 8.04 also in the second 

Hard disk. But the GRUB displyed GRUB error 18 and I was unable to boot 

into Ubuntu.
I googled and all were suggesting a small /boot partiton in a place 

accessible to GRUB and all. I thought all that problem went out the 

window with LILO! And all the while while using Ubuntu 7.04, no 

complaint of GRUB error 18 was seen! This came to the fore only on 

upgradation of Ubuntu! Is it because GRUB is in such a bad condition 

that once it is installed in MBR of first HDD that it is not able to 

boot OS in second HDD? If so what magic was there earlier that it 

booted older ubuntu?
Can anybody help? Pointers please?

I am kinda confused by the recent posts in this list. One post actually
proclaimed that Google could turn Gmail commercial and force you to pay for
it. There was even recommendation to turn to yahoo. (If that was sarcasm, I
missed it completely). I have been under the impression for years that
Google is the ultimate Do-Gooder. Now that Yahoo has resumed bargains with
Microsoft, is imagining that yahoo will remain free for ever misinformed?

Actually, Google's search engine has remained free. Google office is free,
Blogspot is free, Adsense is much more sensible than other ads, then why
should gmail alone turn Payware?

What you read is obviously a joke, a bad one.
Google gets more than what it asks for, from ads alone.
It doesnt need to make us pay for gmail.

What the post intended to say was that monopolies should be
discouraged, because they can result in the companies withdrawing your
freedom, as it has happened with Microsoft.

There's no rumour that GMail is going to turn into a paid service. I
only foresee such a possibility, but with miniscule probability. The
suspiscion lies in the fact that they call it "GMail Beta". Beta
versions are usually free, so that users can test them. I have no idea
when the real GMail will come out, whether it will come out at all,
and whether it will be free or paid when it comes out, and that is
something we can't predict.

The idea is that we should discourage monopolies, because we know the
trouble we face with people handing out MS Word documents, and that is
a result of such a monopoly. That was where there was a mention that
we must discourage the GMail monopoly, and that's where encouraging
Yahoo! etc came up.

schliz alerts us that ISO, in response to the four appeals (Venezuela,
India, Brazil, South Africa) filed in recent weeks, has put the OOXML
standardization process on hold. Here is ISO's press release, which says
that ISO/IEC DIS 29500 will not be published for at least "several
months" while the appeals process goes forward. 
Update: 06/11 10:13 GMT by  KD : Reader Alsee points out that the fourth
officially recognized appealing country is Venezuela, not Denmark as
originally stated. The protests of Denmark and Norway are being
disregarded, as they do not come from the administrative heads of their
national organizations.

EU Calls For Use of Open Standards 

http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/06/10/193252&from=rss 

"In a speech that is being reported as taking a swipe at Microsoft, EU
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes has called for businesses and
governments to use software based on open standards. While not
mentioning Microsoft by name, Ms. Kroes referred to the fact that '[t]he
[European] Commission has never before had to issue two periodic penalty
payments in a competition case' until this befell Microsoft. The things
she told a conference in Brussels will not come as a surprise to
Slashdot readers, but it's encouraging to hear the following quotes from
someone in her position: 'Where interoperability information is
protected as a trade secret, there may be a lot of truth in the saying
that the information is valuable because it is secret, rather than being
secret because it is valuable... we should only standardize when there
are demonstrable benefits, and we should not rush to standardize on a
particular technology too early... I fail to see the interest of
customers in including proprietary technology in standards when there
are no clear and demonstrable benefits over non-proprietary
alternatives.'"

Hi,
You are right, monopolies should be discouraged.
But monopoly comes only when that product is very good and no other product
matches it.
Why would anyone want to shift to something else when the current product is
the best. (Law of inertia.)

Consider Windows' monopoly. You'll find your answer.

Having a monopoly also means they have control, so it becomes
difficult for other companies to provide better services.

Hey,
you are not getting me. Even i agree that monopoly is bad.
Microsoft had monopoly over OS market. Then linux and Vista ( :) ) came
around.
My point is people will use whatever they like. You cannot change their
views by saying, "Monopoly is bad".

Right, I agree on this one. Am not even sure how ethical it is to go
about telling somebody to not use some service in order to discourage
monopoly.

Personally I prefer to discourage monopolies. (And so I adamantly
stuck to my jabber account when everybody started using gmail. I found
out the hard way that people were trying to send me emails to my
jabber account. So well, I shifted to Gmail. If you can't teach them,
join them.)

In fact Debian, Fedora and any software goes through alpha, beta and RC
stages, and none went payware. Looking at Google's history, they are more
likely to lose people than gain money if they go paid.

The idea is that we should discourage monopolies, because we know the

I would not say I discourage monopoly. I discourage companies that enforce
monopoly. If every monopoly must be shot in the head, then so must Linux. We
should start using Hurd or some other "not used by every other FLOSS user"
OS

What if the low cost host is snooping on my mails! Or he/she does not
have the resources (financial, technical etc) to keep the Russian
mafia from sniffing my mails.

When it comes to reliability, security etc I would choose Google over
low cost service providers. Of all the internet businesses Google
knows well that arm twisting users to make a quick buck is bad
strategy.

I am talking about running one's own dedicated server - not taking a

Honestly, I dont think I'm competent enough to keep away the
Russian/east european/pakistani/etc crime syndicates - cpanel vendors
or dedicated servers or even my own machine in my bedroom or whatever.
Remember, these types took over debian repositories and were
undetected for months.

So Google (or Yahoo or MSN) seems to be a more reliable bet.

eternal vigilance is the price of freedom - it is safer and easier to  
entrust your freedom to a benevolent big brother - you *may* be safe,  
but no longer free. It is a choice that each individual has to make.

Hi

There is a little confusion in my mind regarding the 'Link detected'
part in the output of command 'ethtool eth0' . If the network is up
then the command 'ethtool eth0' gives the output as

Link detected: yes


Now if we do a 'service network stop' and then do a 'ethtool eth0'
then it gives a output

Link detected: no


Now 'mii-tool eth0' in both the cases gives the output as

link ok


The link in both the cases is up only the service is down so should'nt
Link detected in both the cases be 'yes' ?

hi

I remember few years back (may be around 2000/2001) usa.net(or something similar to such name) was most widely used mail - it was free and very popular. Suddenly they decided to charge people landing their users into trouble. Most shifted to yahoo then - needless to say - many would have lost data.

  Check whether this set of commands helps you in any way.

1. Boot the Desktop/Live CD.

2. Open a terminal (Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal)

3. As root run the following commands:

    sudo grub

    grub> find /boot/grub/stage1 # Note down the output. It will be like
(hd0,0)

    grub> root (hd1,0) #Hit the <Enter> key

    grub> setup (hd1) #Hit <Enter> key

    grub> quit #Hit <Enter> key, quits grub


5. Reboot (to hard drive).Grub should be installed properly and you should
be able to continue with your ubuntu

Cheers!
Siraj.

mii-tool is using the MII interface available in the HW. It is
indenpent of the interface status. But ethtool might be using status
avail in the driver itself (Not sure), which depends on the interface
status.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0806121142440.1106-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

mount  -- Mount/Attach a File System to a File Tree.

Summary :

All files accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree,
the file hierarchy, rooted at /.  These files can be spread out over
several devices. The mount command serves to attach the file system
found on some device to the big file tree.

Examples :

$ mount  -- List all mounted FSs (FileSystem).

$ mount -l -- List all mounted FSs with Labels.

# mount -a -- Mount all entries in the /etc/fstab.

# mount /mnt/cdrom -- Mount known device to cdrom dir. Mount will find 
                      the cdrom device (/dev/hdX) from /etc/fstab.

# mount /dev/hdd -- Mount device at the known place. Mount will find 
the mount point (Ex. /mnt/cdrom) from /etc/fstab.

# mount -t ext2 /dev/hda2 /tmp/dir1 -- Mount a Linux partition at 
                                       /tmp/dir1.

# mount -t vfat -o rw,umask=0007 /dev/hda1 /mnt/C -- Mount Windows FAT  
partition

# mount -o rw /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy/ -t vfat -- Mount FAT format floppy 
in Read and write mode.

# mount -t nfs 192.168.14.155:/remote/one /local/one -- Mount NFS
partition, from a machine with particular IP, to /local/one dir.

# mount /tmp/fdimage /mnt/test1 -t msdos -o loop=/dev/loop3,blocksize=1024 
-- Mount msdos Floppy disk image via loopback device.

# mount /tmp/cdimg.iso /mnt/test1 -t iso9660 -o loop=/dev/loop3,blocksize=1024 
-- Mount a CD iso image via loopback device.

# mount --bind /mnt/cdrom /mnt/test1 -- Mount the /mnt/cdrom in
another location. So you can access in the FS in two places.

# mount -t tmpfs none /mnt/test1 -o rw,size=1m -- Mount a tmpFS 

# mount -t tmpfs none /mnt/test1 -o remount,ro,size=1m -- Remount the 
same partition with different permission.

# mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt -- Mount a NTFS (Default - Read Only)

# mount -t jffs2 /dev/mtdblock1 /mnt/test1 -- Mount JFFS2 Partition.

# umount /mnt/test1 -- Unmount the file system from /mnt/test1.

Read : man mount, fstab

HTH :)

You should've sent it to ilugc-request@ae.iitm.ac.in and not to
ilugc@ae.iitm.ac.in

Plus, there should be no <...> around your email address /
password. Plus, you forgot to put a dot between gmail and com in your
username

So send a message like this:

unsubscribe manikuty divyagec006@gmail.com

to ilugc-request@ae.iitm.ac.in

And first thing, immediately CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD if you've used the
same password elsewhere. I can guess that you might have used the same
for your GMail account too. Do so before it is too late.

Akarsh

IMO, this solution is not for everyone.  

Besides, assuming one had competency in this domain and the time, many 
sites reject mails from IP blocks belonging to ISPs.  Thanks to 
spammers, the whole block appears in RBLs.

Thanks.  I did not know Linux had achieved monopoly status.  

Anyway, the Linux ecosystem is not owned and/or sold by any one entity - 
therefore, IMO Linux and monopoly are antithesis.

No one is compelling anyone to use Linux.  This is a Linux list so 
naturally there will be a ra-ra for Linux.  

You are free to choose MS Windows, the *BSD variants, Mac OS X, 
OpenSolaris - but Hurd?  Is FSF using it on their production machines?

a hetzner server costs 40 euro a month - if I can get another 5 guys  
from ilugc to contribute, I can set up a mail/web server that we can  
all use - free of the big G and secure (if the best talent in ilugc  
cannot secure a server, god help this planet)

Which is why having a community supported service sounds increasingly
like a good idea. Let's see if there is some "prior art" which can
help.

Making a lot of noise at the ISP's does (eventually) yield results.
One can also use TLS to communicate with "friendly" mail exchangers.

Nice initiative. Am not sure any such 'dedicated' service already exists....

IMHO, most of the guys who end up using Gmail more than Yahoo/M$ are purely
due to the 'threaded' view and the embedded chat in the former.

I haven't used Vista but I have used the Hurd---about 5 years ago when
I decided that my desktop machine could manage fine with Hurd.

Unfortunately, I have since then migrated to using only a laptop, so
I haven't kept up with the development. Is it really so bad?

Most companies have such a HR policy.  I could be wrong but the origin 
may be in how salary structures were created in organizations and the 
thus each slab is associated with a min. educational requirement.

BUT if you are a whiz kid with the talent that the company wants 
*badly*, I am sure Google or any other company will hire you without 
much ado.  Likewise for visa, with 'Net, videoconferencing, all kinds 
of collaboration tools travel to off shores unnecessary (almost).

Would it serve them financially to take such a step? IMO, they gain much
more revenue displaying ads for such a massive number of users. I don't
think a small subset of paid users can ever generate that amount of
revenue for them.
Yeah the costs too would reduce in the latter case balancing with the
reduced income. But, wouldn't google go for a bigger userbase when they
can quite easily manage it.

This works when there are a number of volunteers who can fill each 
other's roles.  My general observation (including LUGs), when there is 
a call for volunteers most step *back* leaving the one who proposed 
holding the baton.  What happens when this person moves on to bigger 
and better things and is unable to provide support?

Good luck explaining all this to MTNL (believe me I have tried upto GM 
Broadband).  Now, I am thankful for little things like my DSL 
connection initializes and gives me 'Net connection.  Cannot comment on 
other ISPs.

I do not understand the above.  Are you suggesting that I exchange email 
with only those whose SMTP servers are willing to accept messages from 
my smtp server?

Lists two sites using Debian GNU/Hurd that are supposed to be live on 
the 'Net.  Tried visiting both sites; connection timed out for both.  
Apparently they are down.

I agree that a lot of people must chip-in. Each person using the
service can (in a small or big way) contribute to its running. Part of
the "prior-art" question is how does one set up things so that this
contribution is possible. For example, bug-reporting must work well.
Some sort of user upgradation system is required. And so on.

Such pessimism is unwarranted. How do volunteer supported services
(use Debian?!) work? The point is to make the service so vibrant that
no one can do without it.

There will always be some mail servers/admins who will blindly follow
the RBL of the most pig-headed of the DNS black-listers.

For the rest of the "friendlier" admins you can offer to use your
certificate-based TLS connection so that "normal" SMTP blacklists can
be overcome. Most MTA's allow for TLS authenticated servers to by-pass
the blacklists.

In any case, the blacklists do not apply to if you are receiving mail
--- only if you are sending it.

Kapil.

mii-tool will return correct link status, even if the eth0 is down. 
But AFAIK it is not the case with ethtool.

Not sure. When interface is down, I am not getting any status info in
the ethtool output and man page says "BUGS: Not supported (in part or
whole) on all ethernet drivers".

Which leads me to wonder aloud on an off-topic rant; why on EARTH does
MTNL Mumbai have the most ice-age rates for broadband access? Rs.199
for a 400 MB makes Mumbai the only area in town where the public phone
company gives a sub-1GB cap for ~Rs. 200. That apart, they have NO
unlimited connection for home users, if I understand correctly.

Yes, I know this is ILUG-Chennai, but couldn't help ranting. Please
correct me if I am wrong.

Thanks.

This depends on how much support for the MII interface is present in the NIC
driver in use. I have come across drivers that do not implement MII
completely and this mii-tool is unable to show you the correct link status,
regardless of the interface status.

Thus mii-tool's output does not always reflect reality as far as the link
status is concerned.

You are right.  MTNL Mumbai is the only ISP that has yet to offer a true 
unlimited plan for the residential customers.  AirTel has unlimited 
plans but only in parts of the city.  

MTNL/Delhi (like BSNL across the country) offers 256/256 Kbps unlimited 
but at a higher tariff compared to BSNL.  I asked the Mumbai babus  
about the differences in Delhi/Mumbai unlimited plans and was told that 
an unlimited plan, in Mumbai, would be abused!  Go figure that one.

At a time when BSNL is coming up with offers which compete well with
the private players, this sort of preferential neglect shown by MTNL
Mumbai is a shame.

Oh right. Tell FOSS users who apt-get/yum install everyday how much of
misuse they subject MTNL's valuable bandwidth to! Oh, the fright! ;-)

Anyway, at a time when the very existence of MTNL is (or at least was,
when there was talk of a merger with BSNL), this sort of giving
"special treatment" to Mumbai is nothing short of retrograde!

Thanks for listening. I end my rant here.

hey guys - from my exp - mii-tool is not capable of reporting correctly for
NICs linking at  1000mbps FD - ethtool can do that -- so yeah if all NICs
are ifconfig up'ed - ethtool is probably a better tool than mii-tool

Enterprise Linux vendors have success stories listed in their website. 
It is easy enough to gather information from that or contact the

Before you go any further; what exactly are you working on? Pick the right one

A doubt on the definition.

1. A lot of clients (mostly American and European) with whom I work
with do use Linux and a few Apache products. When i say they use
Linux, they use it as the base OS for their servers to run on. They
run IBM Websphere server on a RedHat. The end user is not even aware
of these. Infact many Java projects are executed this way. They either
use a Linux box or a AIX/HPUX/Solaris box. But most of the test
environments are on Linux and some (read many) production environments
are either Linux or any of the *NIX.

Do these qualify?

2. A lot of organizations (still sticking on to Java/J2EE) use Apache
TomCat, RedHat - JBOSS and Eclipse IDE for their servers/development
environments. Do these qualify as well? Even those running Websphere/
Weblogic may still be using Eclipse.

PS: I work for a SWITCH company. And most of the work we do are not
commercial products, but are still proprietary that are to be used
only within the organization.

Cheers,
Natarajan.

Problem is NOT in the tool. Bcoz both tool needs a support at the
hardware for MII and in driver for ethtool.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

w -- show Who is doing What

Summary :

w is part of the procps package. w shows information about the users
currently on the machine, and their processes. The header shows, in
this order, the current time, Uptime, no. of current users, & load
averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

JCPU -- The time used by all processes attached to the tty. It does
        not include past background jobs, but does include currently
        running background jobs.

PCPU -- The time used by the current process, named in the "WHAT".


Examples :

$ w -- Show header, users and processes Information.

$ w bharathi -- Show information about bharathi (user) only.

$ w -h -- Don't show header info.

$ w -f -- Don't show FROM (remote hostname) field.

$ w -s -- Short format. Don't show login, JCPU and PCPU times.

$ w -u -- Ignores the username while figuring out the current process 
          and CPU times of the current tty.

propritery software company in blr 


Free Software Talk by Abhas - 7 June 2008
------------------------------------------
 
The talk was presented by Abhas Abhinav, CEO, Deeproot Linux, a free
software based
Company in Bangalore. 
 
For a person who is new to free software movement, the talk may seem
philosophical
for sometime. However, the very presenter being a successful
entrepreneur already 
in free software business, that held the interest levels intact. The
initial slides 
talk about the background of free software, why free software and what
free software
is all about. Even though one of the listeners wanted to jump to knowing
about business
ideas using free software, Abhas's commitment to educate on principles
of free software
business was appreciable.
 
My idea on attending this talk too was about knowing at least handful of
business 
ideas using free software. But as the presentation goes by one could
realize that 
the session's objective was to educate on the model of doing free
software business
and not about discussing business ideas as such. May be it was only my
expectation
that was wrong. The session helps us realize how we are restricting our
freedom and 
hence our knowledge in this proprietary software business model. 
 
Abhas was candid about making us realize how much $$$ he may lose if
someone
adopts his idea and sells an improved product next door. But this is
what a free
software principle is all about.  To be a successful entrepreneur in
this, he
emphasizes the importance of 'Value' that you attach to your product
which wins. 
He says the value that you give in terms of support and services that
stands a
differentiator between you and your competitors. 
 
It may be true that proprietary software business can make you more rich
than your
FSB counterpart. But the knowledge you spread around by distributing
your source
and helping the community to build upon that is a greater achievement.
This liberation 
of mind is what is essential to be a committed free software follower
and a FSB 
Entrepreneur as well. Hence they say, "Free software is not about price
but about 
freedom. Think 'Free' as in free speech and not free beer".

Can w read the minds of programmer geeks and pretty girls? ;)

Just kidding.

Guys,

I shall be bringing tons of books (plenty of linuxjournal issues) and
quite a few textbooks that I no longer want.

I am deliberately avoiding listing all of them here.

A couple of samples.

	a) Windows device driver development
	b) Linux device driver development by Robert Love

and so on.

I dunno the algorithm on who will get what book.

I leave that headache to Bharathi.

See ya.

Hi,
I am not a mobile security expert but I do have some basic idea about it.

> 1. How easy is it breaking into a mobile phone. What are the requistes for hacking a phone( both the hacker and the victim)

One way of attacking mobile is via bluetooth. When ever I turn on my
mobile in public places I'll get hundreds of request to download some
file. I also heard about attacks via SMS but never experienced.

Another way people leak their personal information is via their memory
cards. Most of the people give their mobile for service along with the
memory card. Even if they delete the content a service person can
recover all most all data using data recovery software.

> 2. What  steps  can one take to prevent hacking private info especially when mobile banking etc are popular

Turn off bluetooth in public places or don't accept files from unknown
person. Delete messages containing your personal information(e.g.
mobile banking) from Sent/Draft folders as soon as possible. Always
remove your memory card before giving it for service.

Siva Chandran P

Since most mobile phones run a proprietary OS or mostly a bug ridden
mess that runs over Java or something, we are going to have 
trouble with attackers for sure.

Though the question remains how long it will take for threats to become
real.

> 2. What  steps  can one take to prevent hacking private info especially 
> when mobile banking etc are popular

Most websites that provide mobile banking will work over SSL. If the
mobile browser supports SSL, then the risk is greatly reduced.

> 3.  Is it easy to trace the hacker?

Good question. Most mobiles would have to have an IP address in order to
have Internet access, so I guess the case is not too different from that
of a computer hacker sitting somewhere on the Internet.

If it is a mobile phone of course it is quite easy to catch hold of the
attacker since mobiles announce their position every few milliseconds or
so to the base station.

> 4. What are the information usually hackers would like to access?

I would imagine mobile viruses and worms rather than stealing info to 
begin with. But as I said before such problems have not yet become 
common at least as far as I know.

> 5. What are the benifits of hacking?

Benefits of hacking? ;)

One can become a better engineer and a happier person. Life will have a
new meaning and so on. ;)

You should really be using the word "attacker" here.

Usually virus writers don't stand to gain much I think. 

> 6. what are the most common softwares used to break into a phone?

I dunno. If mobile phones have an IP address you can use pretty much any
cracking software out there.

Once the mobile OS and its vulnerabilities are known the tools for
cracking will become popular. ;)

> 7. What are the 'anti' softwares one can use to prevent hacking?

Such line of thinking does not exist in the linux world.

We don't have antivirus here. 

Instead we do smart engineering to prevent/protect us against attacks.

Not sure what you mean by that.... there are plenty of bluetooth based

visit to Delhi in Feb this year.. unfortunately I dont have that phone 
with me anymore, or I'd be happy to share them )

Girish, again you seem to be contradicting yourself. I guess you mean by 
'smart engineering' that we try to write better software and also to 
build infrastructure to prevent such hack attacks ( eg. SElinux, 
apparmour etc ). There is plenty of intrusion / cracking / malicious use 
prevention software on Linux.

Subject: [Ilugc] Few things left out in yesterday's demo
Message-ID: <20080615021729.GA3831@saraswathy.madambakam.org>

Hello all,

Firstly thanks for such an overwhelming response for yesterday's talk +
demo.

It is hard to point the finger and say why so many turned up. 

Anyway thanks.

This is a short mail to tie up some loose ends.

First I shall answer some of the questions raised yesterday. I had not
come prepared to answer that, so I kinda screwed up yesterday.

a) Can TCP sessions be carried over in a CARP failover?

 It is quite obvious that if the machine that just died was the TCP
server (ssh or HTTP), then of course the session will die. ;)

  However if the failover happens on a firewall/router or some
intermediate machine then of course the TCP sessions will get retained.

b) Shuveb asked something about the Master status being assigned to the
better configured machines.

I demonstrated it yesterday but then it was too hard with just one
display. It is definitely possible and trivial to designate a particular
machine as MASTER all the time.

c) Does CARP work in layer III?

CARP works in both layer II and III. It has a virtual MAC and a virtual
IP address. It is a protocol with IP number 112.

It is only because it is so low level that it works so well.

And of course it is trivial to get it working on OpenBSD. It is also
available on all BSDs. I showed how to get it working yesterday.

And oh by the way, the demo was meant only for technical people and I
wanted to show the technicalities. It was not meant to be smooth; I
guess many people expected the demo to be without hiccups and work at
the first try.

How can we learn if everything works? ;)

Anyway it is just three commands to setup CARP.

# ifconfig rl0 192.168.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.0
(assign IP to physical interface)

# ifconfig carp0 create

# ifconfig carp0 vhid 1 192.168.1.10 carpdev rl0 
  (for MASTER)

and

# ifconfig carp0 vhid 1 192.168.1.10 carpdev rl0 advskew 100
  (for BACKUP)

And of course as I mentioned yesterday CARP will work only when there
are no routers in between. This used to be the case until things changed
recently but that must be tricky to get it working across routers.

Nowadays of course it is possible to make CARP work across routers using
a different technique and CARP also allows load balancing. I have not
tried those things and I would imagine yesterday's setup to be most
common.

I shall take a stab at the routing tutorial I missed yesterday.

And before that one more thing. In OpenBSD and other BSDs, CARP is one
way to achieve failver. The best possible way in fact.

There is another program by name relayd(8) in OpenBSD (not other BSDs)
that can poll for a particular service and failover servers.

I wanted to show this yesterday but it is way too complex and we did not
have enough machines. It works at the application layer and hence there
are pros and cons to it.

Now for the routing tutorial.

relayd(8) or any other load balancing algorithm will work by IP
redirection. IP redirection can be thought of as the cousin of NAT.

NAT rewrites the source of packets going out and by maintaining a table,
rewrites the destination IP whenever packets come in from the same
connection or UDP session.

Whereas IP redirection (known as DNAT in the linux world) works by
rewriting the destination IP address of packets coming in.

So we reflect packets arriving at our network where we are running
relayd(8) load balancer to the real web server hiding behind us by
rewriting the destination IP address.

Now this will work only when symmetric routing is implemented. Which
means that the replies coming from the server has to also go thro' the
machine running relayd(8). It is only then that the source address is
of the replies is rewritten.

Otherwise the client will simply drop packets as it will get confused
why the reply is coming from a different IP address.

I had a lot of trouble with this as I had to get this working with NAT
in my present customer environment.

It can be a pain alright but great fun too since you learn a lot about
routing in the process.

And the networks have to be different.

Remember, all machines in the same network are directly accessible. It
is stupid to assign a machine in one network as the gateway to reach
another machine in the same network. It is so obvious but most people do
not seem to know that physical interconnectivity has nothing much to do
with IP topology and routing tables.

At home I only have all my computers connected in one physical ethernet
segment.

So they are all directly connected.

But I segregated them into multiple networks with the appropriate
netmasks and IP addresses.

Please do not forget this!

	" It is the logical network assignments that determine packet
routing and NOT physical interconnectivity."

It is only because I got this wrong that my relayd(8) deployment at home
was going wrong.

I later got it all working beautifully by building three networks with
two computers in one network using three computers. ;)

You can do a lot more tricks with interface aliasing.

I know I am being a bit vague but it is a deep topic and most people I
meet in the industry know precious little that I wonder where to begin.

A demo is the best way to teach but then we don't have the time.

At this this mail should get you started to think in the right
direction.

Basic idea is that you can play around with just 3 or 4 computers and
one single ethernet switch and create any number of networks and routing
topologies with interface aliasing.

Thanks. ;)

You can save the odf file in html format and use html2wiki website to
create the wiki document. It supports various wiki formats including
MediaWiki and MoinMoin.

Is the study only limited to India ?

I have been helping maintaining the main servers of
www.nepalwireless.netlocated in Pokhara for the past 3 years.  This is
a big success story and
Mahabir Pun, the founder and leader of this project got the Magsasy award
for 2007.  Nearly 20 villages which don't have any telecommunication link
and would take atleast a day's walk to reach are able to communicate with
neighbouring villages and to the outside world because of the network.

Asterisk is running in the server in Pokhara.  The villagers are able to get
medical help from Doctors in Pokhara - using just simple webcams at both
ends - Telemedicine.  They are able to sell/buy their products from
different villages using "HaatBazaar" - an e-commerce concept conceived
mainly for the scenario of these villages.  Poor families - whose only
source of income is some one from their family working somewhere in some
other country - are able to communicate with them at lower cost through
email/chat.  School children are able to get latest information from the
Internet.  And this network as as an income generation for those village
schools.  And the list goes on...

All these services are fully implemented using FOSS.  Even the Linksys
router is running OpenWRT (believe it or not, one friend even got Asterisk
to run in that Linksys box - just in case the other server crashes.).  The
old computers in the villages - which were mainly donated (or dumped) are
still running something between Windows 95 and NT though.

You can have a look at nepalwireless.com.np - which is the internal server
webpage.  Let me warn you, we didn't design the server to keep people out -
but for anyone to get easier access to the services.  This is not a
corporate house that either is worried about its competitions breaking in or
spending money in getting state-of-the-art hardware.  One of the main
headache for me has been to trying to quickly do something when one of the
hardware components fail and keep the services running as much as possible.

Does this qualify your definition ?

Prasanna David

BSG LeatherLink

We develop, implement and support enterprise management software running on
Linux/PostgreSQL/Apache-PHP

FOSS applications

All our clients have one server running the above FOSS software and our
application over it. Most of the clients are manufacturing units and 2 of
them are suppliers to manufacturers. We focus on leather / footwear industry
which is a traditional processing/manufacturing industry.  The servers are
running in Ranipet, Ambur, Vaniyambadi (small town leather processing
centres in Tamil Nadu), Chennai and in Burkina Fasso (West African nation).

We develop our application for FireFox and all client systems are provided
with FireFox browser to use our application.

Market Challenges

Offering low cost, reliable and trust worthy service is the key to success.
Our typical client is not familiar with modern enterprise software
applications and expect a service similar to Tally in price and usability.

We could start with low pricing (with no added licensing cost) and offer
multitude of benefits (secure access over network, provided with source
code, customized service, tailor made modifications).

FOSS support

We need a base Linux install (mostly Fedora, lately Open SuSe) with
development libraries. We compile PostgreSQL, Apach/PHP from source. We have
an SVN checkout of files in servers.

Maintaining and upgrading support applications and our scripts are never a
problem.

Summary

Have atleast 25-30 servers running Linux/Apache/PHP and upto 100 Desktops
running FireFox browser. Most of these are first computers for the companies
operating in rural Tamil Nadu.

I tried this on xterm, screen session, gnome-terminal, Terminal, konsole
and tty. It only works on the last one, what's the reason for that?

Hi All,
       I have noticed huge spikes in server load recently.   Load 
average sometimes hits 50.0 ; however after removing unwanted mail 
alerts from cron load has dropped to  2.0 to 5.0;    I guess even 2.0 is 
a high load for the kind of usage I have.   Mysqld seems to top in CPU 
usage. 

mysqladmin processlist  always reports a dead thread. How do I flush

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] - photo /pic /jpeg related problem - GIMP can help?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0806160226410.29123@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,

I took few pictures in Canon S3 IS camera(JPEG format) and that
uses SD card(kingston 1GB). Picture were fine I when previewed it in
camera after taking all the pictures.

Then after copying into laptop(using usb All-in-one-card-reader; china
make). Some pictures are showing properly. Remaining pictures, when I
tried to view through(picture viewer/microsoft) it shows as corrupted
pictures(only grey in color).

So, downloaed gimp(2.4) and viewed in that. It shows properly in the
preview(small thumbnail like sized picture). But when I double click and
open that it shows as corrupted and shows the dialog box having the
message "Corrupt JPEG data: premature end of data segment".

1)Is there a way to fix the problem in the pictures.?
2)Is the image shown in the preview not read from the data of the
original picture(Is there some portion of the JPEG file which is
exclusively used for preview)? (How/Why in preview image is showing
properly while the actual image is said as corrupted?).
3)What could have caused the problem.? Any way to avoid it.

Tried googling. Did not get proper result. Probably my query string is not
upto the taste of google. ;)

I am not sure whether it is really related to open source. I thought it is
something related to JPEG/GIMP/through some way GIMP can fix this problem.
So, no flame wars; just please answer if you know anything related to
this.

Regards,
carti

Hi Bharathi,

I like to share my understanding about ( who ) command... pls check the
following

[rajesh@server2 ~]$ sudo bash
Password:
[root@server2 ~]# whoami
root
[root@server2 ~]# who am i
rajesh   pts/0        Jun 16 13:04 (192.168.1.48)
[root@server2 ~]#

Please find the difference between "whoami" & "who am i"
whoami - shows the current logged in user
who am i - shows from which user we switched off.

whoami(1) is different from the who(1) command.

It might be ignoring the arguments "am i".

I am not too sure. My camera gives the same problem but I am able to use
the pictures, transform them, process them and so on.

The JPEG data corruption can be handled as long as it is not fatal for
applications.

It is not corruption. I don't think the transfer was improper or
anything. It is just that the different software applications do not
properly parse the EXIF standard or some such thing.

Can you upload some samples? I could take a stab at it.

Same goes for the konsole, gnome-terminal,Terminal and xterm.

Try connecting your camera directly to your computer through the USB
port.  gphoto2 (gphoto.org) has pretty good support for Canon cameras.

Try this option. I use only gphoto2 with my Fiji F21 camera in PTP
mode thru the USB Port. No issues with image quality.

What is your CLI environment?  For me, it does not in KDE/konsole 
but ...  on tty1 console it does.  Go figure this out.

Welcome. Always give proper subject to your mail and Don't reply to 
Digest mails.

Are you using any Linux distro in your PC? If yes, Plz give the 
info. If you are going install one then try Fedora or Ubuntu.

Most of the new Linux distro are supporting Tamil language. Check the 
ubuntu-tam.org for ubuntu specific steps to enable Tamil.

As I can't ask him to write in Tamil, rather than English, till he 
figures out how to do it, lemme at least try to let him know how he 
could have written the above :)

"""I know Tamil language very well and interested in using GNU/Linux (ok 
ok, Linux) in Tamil language. I want to use GNU/Linux in Tamil 
language""" (though the second statement is redundant, let it be there)

HTH :)

Message-ID: <3f97c09d0806161036r6469feeyfcd3b429c866dc95@mail.gmail.com>

Maybe we missed it in the commotion of a certain Kamal movie ;), but still,
"Big Buck Bunny" has been released a while ago and is available for
download.
http://www.bigbuckbunny.org/index.php/download/

Its a short-feature around 10 minutes long, but is pretty cool given the
fact that it is released under a CC license.
And quite obviously it was created using Blender[1]. AFAIK, the DVD set
contains all .blend files and hence would be a perfect medium to showcase
the capabilities of FOSS tools in Multimedia where it seems to lag behind a
bit. (Oh noes, I shouldn't have said that).

Personally, I loved the movie as it is all "furry" with a cuteness overload
(especially the pesky little flying squirrel).

Why not screen the movie sometime, its only 10 minutes long and can be used
as a catalyst for flame wars on an ILUGC meet. :D

Easier said than done.  The point is any service to be vibrant needs 
help (a lot) - ideas, organizing, execution ....  Professional services 
charge lacs for comparable happenings.

I am an optimist; over the past 28 years or so, I have volunteered 
myself in community activities, sometimes paying for travel, board and 
lodging from my pocket.  Likewise, I do it for promoting/advocating 
open source.

It is not pessimism but ground reality.  Volunteer supported service 
like Debian is global and thus the volunteer pool of dedicated 
individuals is large.  They have a different mind set.  IMO, there is 
no comparison.

My observation/comments are specific to smaller and local activities.  
Case in point, the FOSS related conferences I have attended.  Only 
handful of volunteers come forward to organize, execute, and manage the 
events.  Invariably, I have seen the same few faces (of the dedicated 
individuals) working their a** off.

Optimize your SQL queries and tables.  "SELECT * FROM foo" is never good
practice as it may force a full table scan and cause heavy disk IO.  The slow
query log can help you identify the hot spots.  Google "mysql slow queries".

If you have large tables this is a really painful problem.  I used to run
Request Tracker with a +25GB MySQL 4.x backend.  Complex RT searches
could send MySQL spinning forever.  Over time we learnt to tune our tables
and sanitize user queries.  Many times the only way out was to simply restart
MySQL.

Btw, don't forget to check the MySQL bug tracker for any solutions/patches.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

chmod -- CHange file access permission MODes

Summary:

chmod is used to change the permission of the file(s) or Dir(s).  

Interpretation of one line of ls -l command output :-

-rwxr-xr--  1 sbharathi   dsg   10 Feb 14 15:00 myfile
^\ /\ /\ /    \       /   \ /
| V  V  V      ---+---     V
| |  |  |         |        `-- Group
| |  |  |         `-- User/owner
| |  |  `-- Others 
| |  `----- Group      
| `-------- User/owner
`---------- d=directory, -=file, l=link, b=blockdev, c=chardev, etc

There are three kinds of permissions that a user can have for a file:

r) Permission to Read the file.  For Dir, this means permission to
   list the contents of the Dir.

w) Permission to Write to (change) the file.  For Dir, this means
   permission to create and remove files in the Dir.

x) Permission to eXecute the file (run it as a program). For Dir, 
   this means permission to access files in the Dir.

There are three categories of users who may have different permissions
to perform any of the above operations on a file:

u) The file's owner.

g) Group users who are in the file owner's group.

o) Others or Everyone else.

Permissions are stored internally as an integers.

Integer -- Notation -- Meaning

Basic:
 1           x         eXecute
 2           w         Write
 4           r         Read

Ext:
 3 (2+1)     wx        Write and eXecute
 5 (4+1)     rx        Read and eXecute       
 6 (4+2)     rw        Read and eXecute
 7 (4+2+1)   rwx       Read, Write and eXecute


Examples:

$ chmod 777 myfile -- All permission to all. Here permissions are  
                      given in numerical format.

$ chmod 755 f1 f2  -- setting all permissions to owner and read & 
                      Execute permissions to group and others.

$ chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx myprg  -- Same as above. But here permissions 
                                  are given in symbolic format.

$ chmod u+x,g+r,o-rwx myprg -- Add Exec permission to owner, Add Read
                               permission to group and Remove all 
                               permission for others.

$ chmod u-x,go-rx myfile -- Remove Exec permission for owner and Remove 
                            Read & Exec permissions for group & others.

$ chmod -R 755 mydir  -- Set the permission for files & Dirs recursively.

$ chmod --reference=f1 f2 -- Set f1's mode to f2.

$ chmod -c 755 myfile -- Verbose but report only when a change is made.

$ chmod -v 754 myfile -- Verbose output for every file processed.

NOTE: `chmod' never changes the permissions of symbolic links.

Read: man chmod / info chmod

HTH :)

Thank you all.

I tried different ways. But it did not work. Reason: The Flash memory card
it got corrupted I guess. The card shows empty(without any files). But the
files got copied to my laptop. I  suspect the all-in-one-memory card
reader which I mentioned.

Anyway, learning for me from this is, I should straight away copy the
files from the camera itself. And should not remove the memory card out
and inserted into a usb-multi-memory card reader(which is also extra work
and tedious than the straight method of copying from camera).

I had never faced even a single glitch when I had been using sandisk SD
cards(1GB). I am facing this problem only with kingston SD card(1GB) for
the second time(first time simalar but different problem).

So, my mind starts going partial slowly towards Sandisk being considered
as a better one.

Dear Sir,

In my home PC, I use a Debian flavour called BOSS Linux. I have only a
CD drive in my

the distro in my home PC and to learn the fundamentals of Linux. If
you have the distro, I
will install it in my system, copy it in another CD and give back the
original CD to you. Can
anybody lend me the CD package ?

There is no need to install subversion from source on an Ubuntu PC. Just use
the package manager (Synaptic) to figure out the dependencies for you.
Search for "subversion" and install it. Alternatively, you can issue this
command:

sudo apt-get install subversion

from the command line. It will prompt you for your login password.

sudo aptitude install subversion

This should do AFAIK, downloading all the required dependencies if any. 
If you are downloading the source from the subversion site, then you 
need to manually fix the dependencies, build from source and install. 
It's a painful process if you haven't done before and using a package 
manager available in the distribution should be wise.

May be. When I bought my camera from camera city. It came with a (used
and problematic) 1GB Free card. After a download OR 4 or 5 power off
and on, it will show zero photo in the card. When I went back to them,
they gave me a big foolish lecture about flash card and how to use it.

Only after showing the problem in-front of them, agreed to replace it
with another `used' card.

Beware of counterfeit cards.  I worked with SanDisk on a few projects some
time ago and their major concern was counterfeit cards sold in gray markets.
Google "sandisk counterfeit" for more information.

Btw, try Googling for "cisco counterfeit", that seems more lucrative ;-)

If you want to compile subversion from source you will require the
subversion source tar ball along with the subversion deps tar ball.
Have a look at the following link

http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=260&expandFolder=74

which provides you with the latest stable subversion 1.4 release with
the source code and dependencies.

I recommend the following to you:
http://subversion.tigris.org/downloads/subversion-1.4.6.tar.gz
http://subversion.tigris.org/downloads/subversion-deps-1.4.6.tar.gz

You can refer http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/INSTALL for
installation instructions.

Has everyone also seen Elephant's dream? It's technically the first open
movie, and is also about that short. It's a bit too vague IMHO. BBB is a
good movie, with a meaningful (if disturbing) story, and good production
quality as well.

I think some mention should be made about the 'other' modes, namely the
sticky bit and the setuid bit.

chmod +t dir - Set the sticky bit for a directory. -t is to remove the
same
?chmod [u,g]+s file - Set the setuid bit for a file. -s is to remove the
same.

Note that all the above examples (Bharathi's) with mode numbers like
755, were implicitly 0755. If you use 1755 or 2755, you activate the
sticky bit or the setuid bit respectively. 3755 activates both.

The sticky bit allows only the owner to remove the file, though access
is allowed as per the remaining permissions. I've only seen it used on
the /tmp directory, and a few other places where it shouldn't have
been :-P.

The setuid (or guid) bit allows the program to run under a different
user (or group). Ex:
-rwsr-xr-x  1 root   root    22904 Apr 27  2003 /bin/su
when su is run (by anyone), it has the same access rights as the root
user. (as seend by the s instead of an x).

"Proper Earthing"? In Chennai (or Mumbai) homes, this only happens in
one's dreams! Unfortunately, there is no simple solution that I know
of.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

chown -- CHange file OWNer and Group

Summary : 

`chown' changes the user and/or group ownership of each given file to
the specified user and/or group.

Examples :

$ chown usr1 file1  -- Make usr1 as the owner of the file1. No 
                       change in the group.

$ chown usr1 f1 f2 f3 -- Make usr1 as owner for f1, f2 and f3.

$ chown usr1.grp1 file1 -- Change owner as usr1 and group ad grp1 of 
                           the file1.

$ chown usr1:grp1 file1 -- Same as above. But `:' in place of the `.' 

$ chown 500:400 file1 -- Set a user, Whos user id is 500, as the owner 
                         and a group, which id is 400, as the group.

$ chown usr1. file1 -- No group is specified after DOT. So usr1's 
                       login group taken as group.

$ chown .grp1 file1 -- Only group will change.

$ chown -R usr1:grp1 dir1 -- Recursively change ownership of Dir and 
                             their contents. 

$ chown -c usr1 f1 f2 f3 -- Show verbose output only when a change is
                            made.

$ chown -v usr1 f1 f2 f3 -- Show verbose output for every file 
                            processed.

$ chown -f usr1 f1 f2 f3 -- Force/Silent/Quiet. Do not print error 
                            messages.

$ chown --reference=that this -- Set the 'that' file's owner and group 
                                 to 'this' file.

$ chown --from=usr1 usr2 * -- Change a file's ownership only if it's
                              owner is usr1

Note: 
1) Separators `.' and `:' is interchangeable.
2) No embedded white space is allowed between user and group.
3) Instead of user/group name, User ID and Group ID can be used.

$ echo $UID   -- Show User ID.
$ echo $GROUP -- Show Group ID.

Read : man chown

The following is also works when you want to default to the usr1's main 
group.

$ chown usr1: file1

$ cd /home; chown -R usr1: usr1  

works great when you mount /home with different distros that have 
different uid/gid for the same "lexical" user name.

Beware of counterfeit cards.  I worked with SanDisk on a few projects some
time ago and their major concern was counterfeit cards sold in gray markets.
Google "sandisk counterfeit" for more information.

Btw, try Googling for "cisco counterfeit", that seems more lucrative

&gt; When I was trying to Install in my Ubuntu system , it is throwing

&gt;
&gt; So it will be great help if i can get all the dependencies in a single

&gt; COuld any body knows the URL where i can download whole of subversion
package at one go .

If you want to compile subversion from source you will require the
subversion source tar ball along with the subversion deps tar ball.
Have a look at the following link

http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=260&amp;expandFolder=74

which provides you with the latest stable subversion 1.4 release with
the source code and dependencies.

I recommend the following to you:
http://subversion.tigris.org/downloads/subversion-1.4.6.tar.gz
http://subversion.tigris.org/downloads/subversion-deps-1.4.6.tar.gz

You can refer http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/INSTALL for
installation instructions.

&gt; One Day One GNU/Linux Command
&gt; =============================

I think some mention should be made about the 'other' modes, namely the
sticky bit and the setuid bit.

chmod +t dir - Set the sticky bit for a directory. -t is to remove the
same
?chmod [u,g]+s file - Set the setuid bit for a file. -s is to remove the
same.

Note that all the above examples (Bharathi's) with mode numbers like
755, were implicitly 0755. If you use 1755 or 2755, you activate the
sticky bit or the setuid bit respectively. 3755 activates both.

The sticky bit allows only the owner to remove the file, though access
is allowed as per the remaining permissions. I've only seen it used on
the /tmp directory, and a few other places where it shouldn't have
been :-P.

The setuid (or guid) bit allows the program to run under a different
user (or group). Ex:
-rwsr-xr-x  1 root   root    22904 Apr 27  2003 /bin/su
when su is run (by anyone), it has the same access rights as the root
user. (as seend by the s instead of an x).

Message-ID: <20080618050918.GA11893@research.iiit.ac.in>

Since Firefox 3.0 requires GTK 2.10, it will not run on Debian Etch
<http://www.captain.at/howto-run-firefox-3-debian-etch.php>. So, I have
downloaded and shared Firefox 3.0 and its Debian Etch dependencies at
<http://10.94.15.189/firefox-3.0/>.

But after installing GLib with prefix "/home/firefox-3.0-lib", when I try to
install Pango with:

    ./configure --prefix=/home/firefox-3.0-lib

it is unable to locate GLib. I also tried:

    export BASE_DEPENDENCIES_LIBS=/home/firefox-3.0-lib

Same problem with GTK+. How do I tell Pango and GTK+, the location of GLib?

Thanks Raja,
 I had enabled slow query tracking.  btw.. I have noticed the following 
errors , they pop up  three to five times in a  day... in a program that 
is being run every three seconds ..



PHP Warning:  mysql_connect(): Lost connection to MySQL server at 
'sending authentication information', system error: 32 in


Did google for the above problem..  looks like lot of other sites have 
these problem and they show up in google results.. 

They occur at the following line of code.

  $this->connfb = mysql_connect($this->dbhost, $this->dbuser, 
$this->dbpass) or die ('Error connecting to mysql');

This is happening due to heavy DB load.  You may have to tune your
my.cnf file for
higher performance.

Also try using persistent connections in your code if possible.

Its not only volunteering.  However, the management of volunteers.  If there
is a pool of 10 to 20 volunteers, and if there is no one to manage it, then
it will disappear..

Debian is one example of volunteer base..  but there is a core team which
manages all..

similarly, wordpress, and other popular open source softwares are well
managed by core team.

If we could form a core team to define a clear objective manage the
volunteers, we can bring about a change.

Expecting everything to happen out of itself may not be practical..

Just my few cents

I agree about effective management of volunteers.  

But then the managers in such activities/events are also volunteers, as 
humans they are not perfect.  Individuals from these "10 to 20 
volunteers" should also take on leadership when they see a gap, instead 
of just following and looking for instructions from "managers."

The proxy he's connecting to is causing the problem. Further information
will be needed about how he is connecting to the net? Does internet work
otherwise?

Can he access http://archive.ubuntu.com from the browser?

1. echo $http_proxy ... is it empty or is it set to some value?
2. (I don't know a command line way to do this) Go to
System->Administration->Synaptic packager, and then do
Settings->Preferences->Network. Is a proxy set up here?

the managers are visionaries..  the rest are volunteers :)

My opinion is that we dont have leading volunteers..  (including myself)..
we are ready to contribute..  But, we expect some one to lead us..
This is the basic problem in volunteering in india...

I am working in wordpress and i am member of the maling list. but the core 6
members are the visionaries who knows the entire structure of the
wordpress..

Some suggestions:
-------------------------------

1. Not everyone can do every work.  There is a need to analyse, plan and
split up work, which itself is a big task.
Can we form a team and do this? ie, to identify core areas of volunteering,
the works to do, to collect volunteers, and direct them..
This team should focus only on managing..

2. Volunteers who will be working on the ground..  they will be freed from
the hassle of  managing everything, and hence they could concentrate only on
the work they have to do...

Ways to promote FLOSS:
-----------------------------------------

1. To assist in developing skillset among academics.  Once the professor
gets empowered with knowledge, it diffuses to the students.
We can start with selected colleges, and create a model..

2. Create a platform, to network interested students and the academics
across tamilnadu..
the mailing list is not an one shop for all purposes..  this is just for
communication..

3. To form a team to lobby colleges, to adopt floss, and related management
processes..  this lobby team would contain the network of teams who has in
one or other way some influence over college management..

4. To evolve a Open source policy, which would guide us long term.  Now
ILUGC is a directionless ship..  (apologise, if i am wrong or if i have
hurted any one).

Some introspections:
----------------------------------

* Today, i spoke to my sister, who is working as a professor in an
engineering college.  She has good influence over the management too..
I told her about the use of open source softwares such as wiki, blogs,
forums, groupwares, mail server, to enhance students & syllabi managment.

She told, she dont know anything..  (she has completed ME, and completed  a
project in neural networks)..  and asked me teach those..

I realised the enormous gap b/w academia and the industry professionals..
This is one area we need to addres as core thing.

*  When we propose anything to college staffs or management, the first thing
they want to know is how they will be benefitted.. this cannot be avoided,..
but when we could project some paradises ( :) )  out of open source
softwares, they will surely adopt..
For eg, we can project that they can showcase some technological
implementations to AICTE to get good feedback..
Secondly, we can project some cost savings, in terms of operational
management, by using wiki, mail server, etc
also, they have the next big advantage of attracting new students by
showcasing these simple implementations..

* when we could create initial batches of students with knowledge in key
FLOSS softwares, i believe, it will spill over to successive generations..


Any thoughts?????

Senthil

umm, nope. I definitely agree this is a way to *add* a proxy, but in
the context of what I had replied to, he needed to *remove* a proxy
that was set. APT can use the http_proxy variable: which means we need
to unset it.

If I am (was?) not mistaken, if you set the proxy information using
synaptic package manager's proxy settings, running APT on the command
line will respect those settings. So getting rid of the proxy will
require using the graphical interface to de-set those settings. I
didn't know of a command line way to do that. (Perhaps some APT conf
file in /etc?)

If you say the benefit is KNOWLEDGE then that "education father"
will say, "Hah, we don't need that".

If you say the benefit is FREEDOM then that "education father" will
say, "Hah, we don't want to give that to stud/lect".

If you say the benefit is FREE then "education father" ask "Will you
provide free service for us to use FOSS :)

Hi all,
I recently found kevents as an interesting alternative to the wacky
polling which I do in some of my code. It seems that kevents (or kernel
events) is a relatively newer addition to Linux especially considering
the fact that its been there in the BSD kernel for a while.

I googled around and found this lwn article,
http://lwn.net/Articles/172844/

But thats where the problem starts. Given the super-n00b I am, I
couldn't really grasp it and hence, would gladly treat someone with
maggi if he/she could point me to some code which uses these to good
effect.

Also, are there any good books which I should be looking at?

Thanks and Regards

<from man page>
-H if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a directory, 
traverse it
-P do not traverse any symbolic links (default)
</from man page>

For the specific use case, the CLI above is fine as is, have not yet 
encountered symlinks in /home for user dirs.

The relevant configuration variable is set in /etc/apt/apt.conf or
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/* and should be something like 
	APT {
		Acquire {
		Http ...
		}
	}

or it may be something like

	APT::Acquire::Http ...

Both syntaxes are acceptable for apt tools.

See "man apt.conf" for details.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

chgrp -- CHange the GRouP ownership.

Summary : 

`chgrp' changes the group ownership of each given file(s) to the
specified group (group name or a numeric group id).

Examples :

$ chgrp grp1 file1 -- Change the group ownership to grp1. No change in
                      the user ownership.

$ chgrp grp1 f1 f2 f3 -- Same as above, but for files f1, f2 and f3.

$ chgrp 400 file1 -- Change the group ownership to a group, GID:400.

$ chgrp -R grp1 dir1 -- Recursively change group ownership of Dir and 
                        their contents. 

$ chgrp -c grp1 f1 f2 f3 -- Show verbose output only when a change is
                            made.

$ chgrp -v grp1 f1 f2 f3 -- Show verbose output for every file 
                            processed.

$ chgrp -f grp1 f1 f2 f3 -- Force/Silent/Quiet. Do not print error 
                            messages.

But, then you are giving the wrong message. They will only use it for

You have to make them realize that:
1. If they have to sail through or survive the competition, they need
to use FOSS.
2. It is for their vision and future, and not ours. We are already through.

P.S.: This is not an off-topic discussion IMO. Very much on-topic for

Let me share my recent experiences and I believe we should focus at
the grassroots level also, targeting
students.

I had chance to be in a group of students pursuing their engg in
various colleges in and around the city.
I suggested to one of the student (3rd year ECE) to try the latest Ubuntu  8.04;
infact, I gave them the CD that I got shipped from The Netherlands.

He had no problems in installing but the questions he asked me
thereafter did surprise me; he was trying to
install M$ office and winamp in ubuntu (without using wine). I have
assured him that I would help him
further on how to install SW in GNU/Linux, configure and setup new HW.

I plan to introduce (subscribe) him to ILUGC, all this with the
emphasis that this is his choice and an opportunity
to widen his knowledge

Great suggestions.  To the best of my knowledge all of the above fall 
under the charter of NRC-FOSS located in Anna University, Chromepet.

I would disagree that ILUG-C is direction less, I am a member of several 
ILUG lists.  ILUG-Chennai and ILUG-Pune are the most active.  

You should get involved in the ILUG-C sponsored activities, inject new 
ideas or processes.  Please get in touch with Kenneth Gonsalves 
(NRCFOSS) who is also a member in this list.

Unfortunately, lack of open source awareness is true even in premier 
technical institutions like IITs, the percentage of open source 
adopters v/s the total student body is probably < 10%.

Again, NRCFOSS is working on the above aspects.  They organize sessions 
for college faculties so that they can teach FOSS related subjects to 
their students.  Suggest you introduce your sister to members of the 
NRCFOSS org.

In Mumbai, I have approached a couple of colleges to offer FOSS 
curriculum as extra curricular.  The response has been lukewarm.  The 
placement offices are not flooded with requests for candidates with 
FOSS skills.   Likewise, most students in the IT disciplines do not 
care what they learn as long as they see a well paying job associated 
with a subject, then they will flock to it.  The sad part is that many 
students, who in their college days embrace FOSS, loose interest in it 
once they get a job.

Unfortunately, adoption of FOSS solutions in the small/medium enterprise 
(SME) is not much.  IMO, adoption of FOSS solutions in the SME segment 
will drive the FOSS ecosystem.  When industry starts demanding people 
with FOSS skills, the academia will have to adapt as well, the students 
will see jobs requiring FOSS skills and will demand FOSS electives.  

The incumbent in the market is entrenched because it is comparatively 
easy to find service providers.  Not so with open source solution 
providers.  Students

Hi,

I am trying to make our own small web share with Apache and it's
htaccess. I like to know, Is there any FOSS tool are available for
this kind of application?

I am trying to achieve the following:

To send a file to User1, the file will be uploaded in his folder/
account and send a mail to him with the file link. User1 will be
authenticated with a password, whenever he is trying to access his
folder/account or download file.

Bye :)

There is no doubt, ILUGC is very active.  but, by the term directionless, i
mean, we have no focussed goals with end results..  there can be many goals
and many end results..

 this is just my feeling after participating in this for past one year.

I dont support just sessions or seminars on FOSS..  I remember how seminars,
sessions conducted in technical events..  the students just dont listen
much, for variety of reasons, including their lack of practical knowledge..
Even if some one listen, the knowledge dissipates due to lack of practice..

I would like quote yet another new method i followed in introducting FOSS to
my relative who is studying 3rd year in mahendra engg college..
Initially, for the first two days i was introducing him about open source,
linux, linux commands, web server, html, php, wiki..  at the end of the
second day, i observed, that he dont understand any of those things..
Then i made him use some of the basic linux commands, like ls, cd, etc..  he
too practiced it..

On the third day, i downloaded xxamp stack, and demonstrated how to
install..  i patiently made him do all those things..  ALAS..  he doesnt
remember the ls and cd commands that he practiced before..

I again taught him those, and linked those commands to some practical
situations, like moving to a particular folder to start xampp server etc.

Then he learned about how to start xxampp server, ..  till now, he did not
have any idea of web server..  then i demonstrated, how we can access the
webserver from browser as localhost..

now he could get some idea..  but not fully..

Then  on the third day i guided him to create a folder for him under htdocs
of xampp folder, and then asked to practice some html tags..

He did all those tags, but he could not remember those tags after some
time..  he was interested in surfing cricket scores..

Suddenly i got an idea..  I asked him "Do you want to desing your own IPL
site for displaying cricket score?"  ..

he got interested..  and he slowly started emulating the ipl score site..

As usual, the desired layout did not appear.. but he searched through, and
started making the site..

Now, i first told how the site should appear, and left some time for him to
think..  then i guided him how to achieve that functionality using html..
now he easily learned html, how to link multiple pages and then navigation..

Next, i taught him PHP, on how we can simplify reduntant html pages using
server side program..  he then started implementing that..  instead of
database, i told him initialise data using arrays..

And at last, i taught him how to install some basic open source softwares
like phpbb forum, wordpress etc.

I am sure, he might not have understood much of the things, as he is very
new to the technological side.  But the point i want to note is that
theoritical sessions wont help in any way to the students..  They can just
know the names, and only if they are interested..

Practical sessions may help a little bit, but one day session may not be
much useful..

So, what is the solution to break this deadlock

Infuse vision among the students & staffs..  we have to demonstrate how we
can enhance our life (both work and personal) using FOSS..  and how we can
improve an existing setup using foss..
Once they get the vision, then the learning automatically happens..

The foundation itself is not laid down yet..

So, what are the things that we can do to lay the foundation..

1. Develop practical knowledge on Essential basics of software and
development.  it should be in a complete cycle..
      -> Web server, database, PHP, GIMP, HTML authoring  - the basic
constituents of any web development..
           if we strive to teach this,  we have to teach all..  Just a
session on web server alone will be of no use.
      -> gcc, module dependencies, compiling, building existing modules and
running it, IDE,
     ->  kernel basics, device driver, compiling, and deploying
     ->  gtk+ or Qt+, GUIprogramming python, database connectivity, (it will
make a complete cycle where
           one can develop a practical application using these knowledge.
     -> Gambas/Mono, database connectivity, application programming

2. Prepare some practical scenarios in colleges where FOSS can be made for
every day use.
     -> mail server deployed locally opened to internet
     -> wiki, forums, blogs as announcement medium
     -> maintaining webserver, firewall.. server clusters, load balancing -
all connected to internet
     -> Research oriented application - RFID, image recognition, wireless,
mobile

3. We, the FOSS enthusiasts should first start our own networking portal,
with wiki, forums, gallery, videos, file directory, project
management, common user management,  course management etc... the main
purpose, is that we are discussion lot of thing in the mails, which is not
manageable.  If we could do all these in the forums, we can have a organised
& hierarchial discussion..  I feel, with present active member base, we can
very well start online forum discussion, with periodical updates of the
happening to this group.

4. Conduct a membeship drive, pulling in potential academic staffs &
students in to the communication line..

............................

There are much more..  but for now, i feel i dont want to burden you all..

Some of the points are already expressed by me in the past..

My idea is that whatever we plan, we have consider the ground situation..

Message-ID: <C1F024B2AFA0CE4CB8E93810BD9CAA54051C2DB5@xmb-blr-414.apac.cisco.com>

Hi All,
 
Todays Hindu , Blr , Metroplus carried a article on how music might be
free as in freebies soon..it talked about what happened, whats happening
with music  but
not much about "WHY"
 
i thought including "why its happening" and the 'creative commons
movement'  - will give a more interesting picture..
 
http://creativecommons.org/audio - share , reuse , remix - legally !!!
 
 
-S
 
WHAT HAPPENED
------------------------------
"And the legal battle has raged on long and hard as Napster, the world's
favourite P2P music and MP3 sharing service was outlawed in 2001 after
mainstream artistes like Madonna, Dr. Dre and Metallica filed lawsuits
against Napster."
 
 
WHATS  HAPPENING
-------------------------------
"Apple users can use the already existing iTunes music service to
download free as well as paid content. It won't be long before we can
all get the latest records of our favourite bands the day it's out and
more importantly, legally"
 
http://www.hindu.com/mp/2008/06/19/stories/2008061951020100.htm
 
WHY ITS HAPPENING
---------------------------------------
 
 there are lots of other things going on in the Net about ownership.
Music and movies and various other forms of culture are being
distributed better by children than by people that are being paid to do
the work. Artists are beginning to discover that if they allow children
to distribute art in a freehanded sort of way, they will do better than

Fair enough. But you see, people forget that record companies came about 
because it's just a matter of specialization - a very natural outcome of 
progress. Lets face it, musicians want to make music - negotiating 
prices, distributing music, setting up shows - it's better taken care of 
by people who want to do it. Record companies came along, and simplified 
the 'making money' process for musicians. They basically said, "make 
music that sells, you get drunk, do drugs, chase women, do whatever, 
we'll still put money in the bank for you". Of course, most musicians 
took that option.

Of course - music labels have to cover their costs for albums that are 
duds - so they depend on a few hits to cover the cost for the duds. It 
is only fair that some of the artists felt stiffed - but I suspect 
mostly because they don't fully understand how the music industry works. 
The new found freedom of bands like Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead to 
experiment with price models, is basically because the distribution 
costs are close to zero thanks to technology. That does not mean they 
are ready to make money out of it. Nor, I suspect, would they be ready 
to do the 'boring' parts of making that money.

Hence, again, we are going back to square one - some middlemen who'll 
take care of all that hassle, so you're free to make music. What you're 
seeing is not any sort of revolution, just an evolution of a business 
model. I won't be too surprised if YouTube gets into record distribution 
business. Wait. It probably is already in that business. At least, Hulu 
is (legally).

It's nice to make speeches about freedom, art, culture, yadda yadda, but 
the music industry is born out of a necessity, and the current model 
might be crumbling, but there will be a new one in it's place (iTunes is 
just one of its' forms).

Speaking of business models, there are Magnatune and Jamendo with an
emphasis on the freedom part who IMO are doing pretty well.

because the foobar company which recruits the students has got nothing to do

dont blame him , this is situation of most of the student .they read just to
score marks in examation .our formula for mask is

  mark=subheadings + diagram + presentation .

Mark has got nothing to do with concept .Even the student who scores more
90% dont remember / understand any concepts .Even the staff member who
correct our papers forcing us to use the examples/diagram given in the

obviously , you are dumping too many things on him .how he can learn  HTML ,
php , database in such a short time ? This is the reason why students treat
FOSS as a Alien :P . Dont force them to learn foss rather attract them to
your side .

Ask him whether he is really interested in learning foss . Install a basic
Linux distro like ubuntu ,let him use that for a month or two . Later you
can teach about Linux command , xxamp server , mailing list ,forms etc

Hi Luggies,

Today I have got a bad/great experience.
I installed RHEL5 last week with static iP.

some one has entered in my system from these ips 82.79.161.104,92.80.199.219,79.113.9.116 and they created a user with uid of 0(zero) and done nasty things like crashing the system.

I found this by giving 'last' command . which shows me  unknown ip has logged in my system.
Then i check the /etc/passwd file which shows a user named with "girgo" with uid of 0 has created.

I think my root password should be the problem (admin123) which is a dict word and crackers has done their job easily.

They create a user named "oracle" and they create a directory named " bot " and some files and some scripts

I shamed  since i am one of the victim.
I think this will be the lesson for everyone.

Lesson Learned :

1)Password should be strong.
2)Allow ssh from known ips only.
3)Have to take bare metal backup after installing the system , for quick restore
4)Install and monitor any intrusion detection system


Thanks & Regards

I disagree, experience is not just time put in foobar company.  A truly 
motivated person would keep learning open source on his/her own time 
and raise the bar of his/her knowledge.  Many open source contributors 
have regular jobs. This is also experience and I would definitely 
consider such a person for job openings.  In fact, I have recruited 
persons who exhibited a fairly good understanding of Linux even though 
they did not have any degree or experience.

Welcome to the school of hard knocks.  With such a password, you 
deserved what happened to you.

I hope you have not left the system in this state and online.  Suggest a 
fresh install.

or hostnames e.g. dyndns services.  make sure the hostname is updated to

Use tripwire/aide to create file signature db and store the db on a ro 
media only.  When compared it will tell you the files touched by the 
intruder.

This can sometimes be restricting.  I prefer to deploy sshblack

Just wanted to add a couple of things to your list (and thanks for sharing
your experiences, btw).

1)Password should be strong.
> 2)Allow ssh from known ips only.


This is often not practical - esp. when you need to access your machine from
anywhere in the world.
2.1. If possible, run ssh on a non-standard port. Or have your
router/firewall redirect a non-standard port to 22. I've found a lot of
traffic sniffing my port 22 in my logs.
2.2. If at all possible always use a keypair for ssh access. Especially on a
publicly visible network.

3)Have to take bare metal backup after installing the system , for quick
> restore

4.1. Have your system email you every time someone SSH's into your system.
5. Never have ssh allow root logins.

And we all make these mistakes. It's just gutsy of you to admit it :)

Whether this is good or not depends on the context.

For example, suppose your system is remotely administered. If those
few IP addresses become inaccessible to you then you are locked out of
the system.

Your other suggestions: strong passwords, backups and an intrusion
detection system all sound good.

I had a similar experience on my home machine.
Moving SSH to run on a non-standard port and running denyhosts prevented
further brute force attacks.

Not really. Kprobes has been around for a longer time and is pretty low 
level. If you want something similar, try systemtap.

If you count the number of FOSS jobs in this mailing list to the number 
of FOSS jobs appearing in all Indian mailing lists to the actual number 
of FOSS jobs available through contacts, it's something around 1:5:10. 
You can get a FOSS job if you are pretty active in the community and 
have fair amount of contribution (not just in code, participation also 
counts). How do you think many of us got jobs? I got my first 
programming job just that I wrote a blog post of basic MYSQl stuff in 
GNU/Linux and it was useful to someone who was running a startup ;)

We all know that you do your BE just for getting a better job and we 
also know that till the mass recruiting MNCs exists and continue their 
current method of recruitment this is not going to change. It's not just 
enough if you read your prescribed books and score marks, once you are 
out of the college and on your first job not many care about them. Then, 
what matters is how much you know and what all you can do? As you have 
wasted the wonderful years at college, where you neither got your basics 
right not spend the free time to learn and practice something useful you 
have nothing much in your hands.

He was trying to teach the boy some basics and an initiative, and not 
trying to make the-best-in-the-city web developer. You should take each 
of them a day to learn and be comfortable with the basics of each, and 
the rest of the time you try to apply them and build something, in the 
process learn more and correct yourselves of things you got wrong or 
couldn't understand. HTML, PHP and Database is not a big deal at all,

Ok, lemme ask you a question. What do you mean by "FOSS" and "learning 
FOSS"? This is one question is always ask people who speak about FOSS, 
learning FOSS, FOSS jobs etc. and most of the time they have a pretty 
absurd definition for them.

Hi Mugunth,

We are using http://www.a2hosting.com/ for sometime now. The technical setup
and service response are impressive.

They have svn hosting option, I have not used it. You can try it.

Hi ,


I would like to know whether there is a anti virus software in Linux ( Red hat ,Debian or Ubuntu ).

Yes i know  in Linux we don't have any virus . But its  98% true .

1) But for the sake of completeness i need to know whether we have any anti virus software ( Open source or commercial ) in Linux environment .

2) In the same line as above do we have anti spyware/Malware/spamware software available for Linux .


If yes , could you please let me know the product names ( open source /commercial )

Many thanks in advance for your time and help.

Cheers

I am dumping everything to him..  and its not that he is not interested..
the truth is that he dont know anything about computers, except for
browsing..  he came to me, just to learn something..

You see..  before he gets used to windows, i am training him on Linux/FOSS
..

/**obviously , you are dumping too many things on him .how he can learn
 HTML ,
php , database in such a short time ? This is the reason why students treat
FOSS as a Alien :P . Dont force them to learn foss rather attract them to
your side .
**/

Dumping means, making a person sit in front of you, and read everything..
(the one that's happening in schools and colleges)..
What i did was to align myself to his interest (IPL matches), and use that
as a theme for him to learn technologies..

He is not actually learning html, php exclusively..   rather, he is doing a
job of his interest (ie designing a site for IPL score), and in that process
learning html,php etc..  (i havent started database yet :) )

ie, instead of simply knowing things, he is learning how to apply those
things in real time..

Btw, forcing is not all that bad..  My father forced me to a computer course
in my 6th & 7th annual leave...  that provided a basis (like variables,
arrays etc) for me learn pick up programming..

read  that mail carefully , you will  understand that the guy is not
interested in learning HTML and PHP .

and not trying to make the-best-in-the-city web developer. You should take

may be its not a big deal for you ,but for me it took more than three months
to learn all these things myself .

well i remember my college staff members , this is what they do , they will
start asking questions , if any student happen to suggest something or ask a
doubt .Even if the students  answers correctly he/she  will be tapped
somehow .so let me assume that i am tapped in this .

May be. But surely not every head and tail of it. Until unless you keep 
going through them and put them in practice, even the favorite things 
vanish from memory. He was not able to remember the tags because he had 
used them only a few times. He will start remembering things once he 
starts using them more and more, and deciding that he is not interested 
just because he can't remember them the very next time is not wise.

It takes a day or two to read from somewhere and say "Hey, i learnt it". 
But when you sit and try to implement them, that's when you learn them 
really (and you also learn you haven't learnt anything much and still 
have a long way to go). It depends on how much you put things to 
practice, that much you learn. I took me two days to cover up basic of 
Python and say am ready. But it took me a year and it's still going on, 
the learning.

A typical mentality of a persona I tend to call a kid, characterized by 
not taking things with a pinch of salt and assume that what people want 
is to prove them wrong. What I asked was your personal understanding of 
the word FOSS and what you replied was some emotional counter-statement.

One of the system admins in my earlier jobs instead of running
  # rm -rf basedir/subdir

executed the following command
  # rm -rf basedir/ subdir  -- note the space before subdir

and deleted nearly 2 months of production data in topdir.
He did not lose his job, but his company was heavily
penalized.

Yes, I agree to this. I infact learnt more on collaboration tools like
wiki,forum,trac,openfire only when i installed ubuntu on my office PC(thanks
to the freedom my company gave unlike most foobar companies which require
approvals to install firefox) and learnt them and after 2 months finally
made it as a successfull collobaration portal which the planned sharepoint
portal tried to achieve.Though I am working on microsoft products, I goto
FOSS tools/solutions to make my day easy when i am restricted due to
licenses.

Is there any FOSS tools are already available for this purpose?

You have hit the nail..  this is what i am referring to..  we need to devise

project, or school management etc.

Let our new approach be a initiator for the larger academic transformation,
both in school & colleges..  at any cost, we need to come out of the
macaulay system, which produces only clerks and educated coolies :)

Imagine, if the education department enforces a law, which  makes it
mandatory for the student to participate in any of the real time projects
right from second year.. (backed by proper planning and infrastructure)..

Btw, i heard from a professor that Anna University is working on to network
all engg colleges by OFC..  if its so, this would unleash new era of
connectivity..  But, as usual, we are still underequipped to utilise it..

Sir,
     I am tried Ubuntu 8.04 live cd in pc already having RHEL4 OS.
I try to access Home directory as R/W. Hence i use chmod command in root
user of ubuntu. After that i tried to boot PC in RHEL4 normal user it says
home/user directory not available and are you wish to create at root
directory now. But rootuser is working. After checking, it was found that
/home having ower of '999' instead of 'root' and all the subdirectory having
same owner. Then i changed it to original owner and permission, now it is
working fine.

My question is who is the owner '999'?

I request the experts to explain the same.

N.Padmanathan,
Ooty.

Can one assume that users will not have shell access to the system?

If that is the case, then the task can be carried out roughly as
follows. The initial setup is:

1. Create a bunch of users on the system via an htpasswd file (or if
   you can, LDAP).

2. Use "UserDir" to map each user to a specific directory.

3. Use the "Require {username}" directive in the .htaccess file for
   each of these UserDir directories.

Any time you want a file to be accessible by that user copy the file
with global read permissions (and owned by nobody!) to that user's
UserDir and send a mail with the file link; you can even use symbolic
or hard links if you want to save space while providing the file to
multiple users.

Regards,

Kapil.

to what extent do you need management? Do you want them to create/ 
modify repos and give permisions? Or do you need a server with svn  
installed so that you can do that yourself? For the second, depending  
on your budget:

webfaction
slicehost
hetzner.de

If file sharing is your objective, take a look at TikiWiki, Epiware 
(Comm. lic.).  TikiWiki has loads of modules, you need to turn only 
those you need.

Other project management or groupware apps also have file sharing 
functionality but may be overkill for your needs.

I recall doing this once with user-mode-linux but didn't record the
session. You may want to try it with u-m-l or with qemu. It hurts
less when you play in the sand. :-)

It should manage to "go the whole way" since the executable image
does not need to load/link anything after it starts purging things.

Seriously, has anyone tried it?  I suspect after enough damage like 
removal of shared libraries rm might start complaining about not 
finding "stuff" it needs to do it's job.



I did it once (as a root, on /) on my redhat machine, when i was a trainee.
After 10-15 sec i realized what i did and stop it, but was too late.Then, 
I wasted a day in office.

Now, I have moved to Ubuntu, and safe.

Actually, if you install "safe-rm" then you may be safe!
This package just recently entered Debian unstable.

Package: safe-rm
Priority: optional
Section: utils
Installed-Size: 104
Maintainer: Francois Marier <francois@debian.org>
Description: wrapper around the rm command to prevent accidental deletions
Tool which prevents the accidental deletion of important files by
replacing rm with a wrapper which checks the given arguments against a
configurable blacklist of files and directories which should never be
removed.

Users who attempt to delete one of these protected files or
directories will not be able to do so and will be shown a warning
message instead.

Protected paths can be set both at the site and user levels.

I have an alias in my .bashrc ...

alias rm = "mv -t ~/.Trash/"

Of Course, you have to remember a different set of options.. eg. -rf wont
work... It moves directories implicitly..


And yeah.. When you feel the size has exceeded a certain limit, you can
delete it with /usr/bin/rm -r ~/.Trash/*

Open source is not just about learning new softwares and tools, its a
passion running through our blood. Before we ask people to use FOSS,
we should tell them why they should move to FOSS.
The first thing we should do is to decide from where and which part of
the community we should attack. There are so many people who use FOSS
but don't know about the local communities that we got. There should
some way of reaching them and bringing them together. This can be a
topic of interst in the next ILUGC meet.

Ask one of your friends to try it from their home. It'll work for him.
Its not possible to view your own address say http://59.xx.xx.xx/ from
inside your own subnet because of the port forwarding.

you may not even need sshblack to do this type of blocking. modern versions of
iptables has built in capability to do this. for example, do

iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent \
        --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 2 -j DROP

the key numbers are the seconds and hitcount. above will limit incoming ssh
connections to 3 per minute from any single source ip. usually the breakins will
try multiple userids and passwords - and after a couple of failures, the above
will cause connection requests to be dropped for the next minute. that is
usually sufficient to make the remote script think the machine is inaccesible
and move on to the next target. sshblack can do more, but this is usually
enough. one could increase the 60 - but this is short and in case of our own
inadvertent mistakes, this is short enough an interval to wait out. this type of
rule is in effect on this mailing list server for some months.

Safety precautions:

Do not modify the behavior of "rm" with the same name. Use a different name
instead. If one gets used to a safe "rm", one will expect the same safety
even on an account/computer that lacks the new behavior, leading to
disaster.

To override any safety alias, use "\rm" instead of "rm -f". "rm -f" should
never be used interactively as it disables some safety restrictions.

It would be better if you indicated that wildcard expansion is done by the
shell, and not by "rm".

Agreed. I've noticed that lately that quality has improved. Even better,
last.fm will play a lot of Free music (yes, with a capital F), which is
supposed to match you're existing tastes. That hasn't really happened
for me, but the idea's nice. I'm still to see a use of the Freedom to
modify the music though... I remember a discussion on LugRadio about the
pointlessness of Free music without it's sources, the muscial
tabulature.

While Magnatune isn't exactly about Free music, it still is very
musician/user friendly, taking a very small preimum of the amount *you*
decide to pay (as long as it's over a resonable minimum). 

I also would recommend a read of Free Culture
(http://www.freeculture.cc), a very nicely written book by Lawerence
Lessig about the point of Free content. Refreshingly, it's not overly
biased, or RMS-fanatical. And it provides some good insight into how
terrible the RIAA et al. are.

And finally, a pinch of OT, does anyone know where one can by books like
Free Culture, Cathedral and the Bazaar in a book store? I know I can buy
online, but I wan't to see if I can get them in India (and yes, I know
they are free, but I'd like to buy a book to support the author in any
case).

Sayonara,

Message-ID: <1214050613.3052.33.camel@vimzard.home>

I'm sorry, there are just too many points to quote every where, I can
only place topic headers

Sentilraja's Experience
-----------------------
I think Sentilraja's approach is fully valid. It takes a lot of will to
get somebody doing something. True, the guy wasn't overly enthusiastic
at first, but honestly, if he were enthusiastic, he'd have started on it
already. Bringing in something that he'd *like* to do with it was a
great way IMHO.
?
I also find that the approach of personally guiding somebody through the
ropes is the norm for introducing people to Linux. It's very troublesome
to go install Linux on my classmates computers, but even harder is to
keep with them through getting used to things on the Linux side. Lately
I've realized that I've gotten very esoteric with my computing habits; I
use Vim nearly exclusively, a not so well known distro, ArchLinux, I
drop to the shell for nearly everything. I found that all of this puts
off a lot of my friends who are overwhelmed by the black terminals and
me typing so much. 

My part-solution was to install Compiz-Fusion on a few of their
computers (always gets them), install their codecs (yes, this isn't
Free, but I can't do anything about mp3's dominance in the music
market), before hand so they can at least make do. I just hope that as
they use it, they'll gradually come to understand the concepts of
Freedom. Some people like the change, some people don't.

?Jobs/Placements
----------------
About jobs and placements, I agree that getting a FOSS-related job is
hard via the campus placements, and generally happens only if you've
already been involved, and approach an existing company (igalia, novell,
Red Hat, OpenedHand). For this to happen, awareness of FOSS companies
has to increase.

I've met a very interesting set of people in the GSoC community, many of
which weren't so much into FOSS before the project (but now are
genuinely interested). I credit this to Google's extremely open approach
to the project. You're forced to learn how to learn from the internet,
man pages, etc. (which is not something most college students do). This
is something that is a prerequisite *and* motivator for open source.
Personally, I became involved with FOSS because I could learnt how to do
it on my own, without any investment in books/courses.

I would also like to mention a friend who is working doing an intern in
a embedded devices company (using Linux as their OS). She was introduced
by a senior friend who started the company, and is now porting code onto
the ARM architecture. She's shown a *lot* of enthusiasm to learn more
about linux and I felt really happy to see that. (Moral: Friends are
great to pull into open source).

I've found Shakthi Kannan's presentations on the topics very good, and I
hope he comes to IIT to give such a presentation some time :-P. One good
thing that IIT has, is that several Deparment Computing Facilites (DCF)
run entirely on Linux. I managed to convert someone by SSH-ing into his
deparment account and helping him upload/retrieve his assignment :-P.
Also, being in the CS department, we use gcc as the offical compiler, a
further impetus to use Linux. If an institute uses these kind of tools,
the students will try and migrate. Few students will put themselves
through the trouble of learning how to use gcc, etc. when they need to
submit Borland TurboC++ compatible code (which is notorious for it's
lack of standards compliance).

Also, a lot of people are put off by the lack of GUI tools, which in
fact isn't so lacking. Pranesh Srinivasan, a second year, told me that
most of the students use GEdit to write their projects! Suggesting
Anjuta as and IDE would definitely help people. Now a days, there is
almost always a gui for everything. Most of us may not use them, but it
would certainly help if we kept them in mind when advising friends (as I
oft fail to do).

Remembering Tags, etc.
----------------------
As for remembering tags, etc. I still look up w3c for all the smallest
things, and grep the Gtk documentation to clarify function call
parameters. And I've been doing both extremely enthusiastically for the
past 2 months nearly non-stop. Some people can remember things well,
others, well, remember how to find them out...

Cheers!

Thanks for that! I loved the fact that the kitty's life was at stake,
but the music was in bad taste....

It's as I suspected, a lot of things are loaded in RAM, so even after
being deleted as files, they can still execute. But I was dissapointed
to see so many "Operation Not Permitted" s. Oh well, there must be other
ways to kill kittens...

Just plug your disk into the new machine,  and run pvscan/vgchange for
the new LVM2 partitions to be detected.

Btw, the on-disk structures for logical volume managers, soft raid, filesystems,
etc. are constant across 32/64 bit machines as well as different architectures
like arm/x86/sparc/etc.  Eg. you can take a ext3 disk from x86 and mount it
on an embedded arm device without any issues.

There is always a lvm.static built into the lvm packags ( there has been
some noise and some distro's have stopped doing it - but a majority of
places its still there ). if you have a library issue, you can always
fall back to using that binary ( /sbin/lvm.static )

Yeah CollabNet offers managed Subversion hosting + lot more tools for
doing software development integrated in single platform. If you are
looking for free hosted service, there are lot more. Check this link

I use a similar setup on all my servers as well.  A word of caution:
it is essential to implement filtering only the external network interface or
subnets for it is easy to establish more than N connections per minute over
the LAN through regular usage through various shell scripts, maintenance
tasks, etc.

Subject: [Ilugc] GCC in CPP
Message-ID: <1214086439.3052.82.camel@vimzard.home>

I came across this interesting link on Planet GNOME, about two
presentations made at a GCC Summit (by Ian Lance Taylor), concerning the
reimplementation of parts of GCC, et al. in C++
http://www.airs.com/blog/archives/209

If find the idea of reimplementing gcc in C++ to be interesting, if
redundant. There are some interesting points on speed improvements, but
largely nothing especially impressive.

However, the presentation on a C++ reimplementation of the linker (ld),
is well, gold ;-). The results are *very* impressive, and I'm surprised
something like that was pulled off largely by one man. If GCC sees such
improvements as well...

What do you all think about it?

*OT ALERT*
And lastly, since I predict this will be raised anyway, one can't help
but notice the gorgeous beamer theme. I've never seen more beautiful
presentations then those made with LaTeX and beamer.

You have to try it from an "IP" *outside* of your LAN.  Ask some of your 
colleagues/friends to access your WAN IP from their systems.

Accessing your WAN "IP" from within your LAN will exhibit the behaviour 
your are experiencing.

BTW, I hope you have disabled your modem configuration on the WAN.

Multiple ssh connections are not really required for recent openssh 
clients. These create a local "connection socket" which allows
multiple ssh clients to operate through one TCP connection.

For example my config file for a specific client looks like:

Host	somename
User	myname
ControlPath	~/.ssh/%r.%h.sock
ControlMaster	auto
StrictHostKeyChecking yes
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/myid_dsa
PasswordAuthentication no
UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ForwardX11 no
ForwardAgent no

As a consequence, if I log in to "somename" once, then the
same TCP connection can be re-used by other clients---without
re-authentication. This is most useful if I later need to "scp" a file
to the "somename" while remaining connected.

Regards,

Kapil.

I use ssh and screen for my training sessions, It helps me to share my
terminal with them. Here session is very interactive so that, my self as
well as my trainees work on the same single screen.

Each time every one has to pass ssh authentication, is that any way to by
pass authentication.  they use putty and try to connect from windows
workstations.


any clue ??

cheers

No I still get the same result even if I access it from some internet
cafe[I don't know what connection they have]. I think that if the
requesting IP also belongs to BSNL, they are getting blocked by the
authorization page. That's exactly why those proxies work in this case

Why?  IMO, it is redundant. Those who understand shell programming 
already know that the shell expands the wildcard.  Those who don't, to 
them it does not matter whether the shell or rm expands the filename.

Most DSL modems are unable to port forward when the
modem's internal web server is also running on the same
tcp 80 port.

To get this working, first change the port for your modem's
internal HTTP server (refer to your modem manuals for this
one).  Once you do this, the port forward rule you have setup
on port 80 should automatically start working.

If that does not work, run apache on a different port eg 8080
and setup your DSL modem accordingly.

Btw, a simple way to test your setup is to visit validator.w3.org
and provide your IP as the URL to be validated.  If you see your
apache page, then your config has worked.

Do BSNL ADSL connections come with a static IP? Airtel doesn't but Tata
does.

Static IP is charged extra.  My understanding is that both BSNL and MTNL 
have a very similar architecture (the telecom hardware, billing, 
service plans etc.) for their ADSL offerings.

No(?). Recently applied for the BSNL-BB. In that, there was a check
box for "Need a Global IP" (I ticked the yes). Now I am getting a same
global IP, every time I connect to BSNL.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

shred -- Overwrite/Delete a file securely.

Summary:

`shred' overwrite the specified devices/ files repeatedly and remove,
in order to make it harder for even very expensive hardware probing to
recover the data.

Normally when you remove a file (with `rm'), the data is not actually
destroyed.  Only the index listing where the file is stored is
destroyed, and the storage is made available for reuse. There are
undelete utilities that will attempt to reconstruct the index and can
bring the file back if the parts were not reused.

shred uses many overwrite passes, with the data patterns chosen to
maximize the damage they do to the old sensitive data.  While this
will work on floppies, the patterns are designed for best effect on
hard drives. For more details, see the source code and Peter Gutmann's
paper `Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory'.

shred relies on a very important assumption that the file system
overwrites data in place.  This is the traditional way to do things,
but many modern file system designs do not satisfy this assumption. It
is more reliable to shred a device than a file, since this bypasses
the problem of filesystem design mentioned above.

Example:

$ shred file -- Repeatedly overwrite the file content with random data.

$ shred -v file -- Show progress info.

$ shred -n 5 file -- Overwrite 5 times instead of the default is 25.

$ shred -x file -- Use exact size. Don't round of.

$ shred -z file -- At the end of shred, overwrite the file with zeros.

$ shred -u file -- Overwrite, Truncate and Remove the file.

$ shred -s 6K file -- Shred the first 6K bytes of the file.

Read: man shred

A global IP comes in handy. Interesting they provide an option. Airtel guys
provide that option, but it is a few thousand rupees, IIRC. Their service is
good. But when they come out with new plans, they never tell you about it!
For example, they now provide 384 kbps for Rs. 999. I was getting 256 kbps
for the same amount for a few years. I saw the tariff revision on their
site, but the call center folks asked me to go to a showroom dealing with
landlines and write a letter.

Well, it was years since I wrote a traditional letter with pen and paper and
I forgot if the "From" comes first or the "To". I shamelessly copied from a
letter left on the desk. It is weird that they make it as difficult as
possible for guys to change the _current_ offerings. I wonder how many guys
are still stuck to the 128 kbps plan for the same amount. ;-)

I thought your home was taking up space. But looks like you have a separate
partition for your home. Look into these areas for files taking up space and
remove them:

* /var/log/*
* /tmp/*

Also consider removing debian package(.deb) files:

* apt-get clean (if this does not work:)
* remove files in /var/cache/apt/archives/*

You can try this instructive experiment yourself.

Here is the list of commands:
 1. aptitude install qemu
 2. wget http://bellard.org/qemu/linux-0.2.img.bz2
 3. bzcat linux-0.2.img.bz2 > test.img
 4. qemu test.img
This opens a window with the emulator running in it.

In that window you can type
	rm -rf /

The system complains a bit about not being able to remove
some directories like /dev/pts, /proc/asound etc.

You are returned to the command prompt since the shell 
is a running process.

At this point you need to kill qemu externally.

You can use qemu-img to then examine what files are left in test.img

Regards,

Kapil.

Good advice.

The OP should also try to put /var, /tmp on separate partitions.
If /var is on a separate fs, you can limit the damage caused by
a bad app thats rapidly filling up /var/log/.

The FreeBSD handbook provides good reading on why/how to
partition:
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/configtuning-initial.html

I typically put /, /usr. /tmp, /var, /home, /data on separate partitions.

First of all pls. avoid top posting and also trimming unnecessary text 
from quoted message.

The partial sub directory is used to save partially downloaded files.

$ sudo mkdir -p /var/cache/apt/archives/partial 

should solve your problem.  You should delete only the .deb files.  Next 
time do
$ sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb

Just wanted to add that this blog post may be relevant:

http://kstars.wordpress.com/2008/06/16/switching-on-a-lightbulb-from-360km-away/

They use a script to update the IP address to the server at some time

I also wish to add that it is better to use apt-get clean to recover
the space, rather than manually modify the contents of
/var/cache/apt/archives

You also removed a _directory_ called partial!

as root "mkdir /var/cache/apt/archive/partial"

You should have used the command "apt-get clean" instead of manually
deleting stuffs from the folder.
I don't remember there's some command to fix broken packages, will google
and revert back

Dude, you told me apt isn't working for some reason. And I've also mentioned
you need to remove only .deb files. You seem to have gotten Kumar and the
others pissed off by doing a 'rm -fr' in there. Didn't you see a huge
discussion on 'rm -fr' still raging on the list? Anyway, I guess you got the
free space you needed.

Message-ID: <0213965108DEAD48960CE83455E07DFFFC2EA4@maa-exchmb.maa.corp.collab.net>

I am trying to sending mails to a group of email ids using the interface
provided by my web hosting company. After doing this today morning my
hosting company blocked my site and when checked with them, they say
sending bulk mails from his domain will blacklist the site. The list
which I am sending to is a list of known people who choose to get this
mail. 

I need to do this frequently, is there a alternative best way ?

Will this be the same problem if I try to setup a local mail server in
my ADSL connection (static ip)?

My suggestion is to allocate some more space for root partition ,you got
only 4.6GB really its not sufficient .You can resize the partition using
gparted livecd .

I heard resizing the root partition is the thing which is highly discouraged
due to some specific reasons.
Is it correct? I had to reinstall my ubuntu when I saw my / filling up some
months back...

I'm not exactly upset, but just remarked that having done in the first
place apt-get clean would have saved the OP the trouble of having to
wrestle with the system to undo the changes. :-)

On the sending side it may be OK as long as recipient's mail servers 
don't reject mails from IP blocks already on RBLs (IIRC, BSNL/MTNL are 
on the list).  Way back I had probs with AOL and Hotmail - mails were 
rejected.

On the receiving side he has to set MX records to point back to his IP 
and do port forwarding to the mailman host.  

OP, alternately, if you have a GMail account, you can use their small 
biz package and have them handle emails for your domain.  I use Yahoo! 
MailPlus service - no limits on my bcc/cc/to lists.

Never use BIOS unless you _have_ to --- after all it is non-free ;-)

More seriously, with a rescue image you can resize any partition as
long as you do it carefully.

Equally seriously, you should not need to run a re-install on modern
Linux systems unless you have done something close to 'rm -rf /'.

Here is one reasonable way to partition the system (which is supported
by the Debian Installer and hence is probably supported by the Ubuntu
installer as well).

	/dev/hda1	ext2	1-2G
		1. Usually mounted read-only as /boot.
		2. Contains a full rescue image which 
		   can be loaded and run from RAM.
		3. Also contains grub, kernel, initrd for
		   regular system

	/dev/hda2	LVM or encrypted LVM (rest of disk capacity)
		1. Contains all your swap, /usr, /var, /home, /tmp
		   partitions as logical partitions.
		2. All such partitions can be resized and/or
		   mirrored and/or snapshot-ed for backups.

Regards,

Kapil.

True. You can do funky things with your Free (AIFB) OS. Once I faced the
same problem described here. I had gone crazy and created separate /boot,
/home, /var and /tmp. After installing packages left, right and centre one
fine day, /usr fills up and / has no space.

I then picked up a partition and moved its contents elsewhere. In this case,
I can see there are several mounted on /media/*.

I then did this to format the new partition and copy the contents from /usr
to the new place:

# mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdaX
# mount /dev/hdaX /mnt/tmp
# find /usr -depth | cpio -apdmv /mnt/tmp
# umount /mnt/tmp

I then booted the sytem via a live/install CD and mounted the old root FS on
to /mnt/tmp and did these things:

This is just in case you screw things up, rename the old /usr

# mv /mnt/tmp/usr /mnt/tmp/usr-old
# mkdir /mnt/tmp/usr

Now I opened the rootfs's fstab and added an entry to mount the newly copied
/usr into place:

/dev/hdaX        /usr        ext3        defaults        0 0

After unmounting, I rebooted into the new system, ran a bunch of programs to
see everything was OK. then ran the final command to get free space bliss:

# rm -fr /usr-old

Now a days, I just have one monolithic "/" partition ranging a few 100 GBs.
But constrained resources did teach me lessons in partitoning, custom
kernels and good system administration.

HTH,

Subject: [Ilugc] spam control technique that works
Message-ID: <20080623154525.GA8836@saraswathy.madambakam.org>

First read this.

+------------------------------------------------------------------+

        Spam control with OpenBSD greylisting

Spam control has to invariably fall under one of the following
categories.

        a) Bayesian filtering and contextual analysis 

        b) Heuristical filtering based on known keywords/bad words 

	c) CRM114 Markovian chain based filtering (related to a) 

	d) Vipul's razor approach of DCC 
        (Distributed checksum computation) with manual
        interference - gmail uses this heavily 

	e) Greylisting to stop spam right at the MTA level 

	f) IP address blacklisting and
        e-mail address whitelisting 

	g) TMDA - cure worse than the
        disease (Only approved senders can send mail) 

	h) RBL lists ,
        spamhaus (politically sensitive spam control techniques) 

	i) SPF from Microsoft (not a bad idea per se) 
	but does not work well

This is more or less it.

And most of these techniques are based on content scanning/filtering and
actually reading e-mails with a computer.

Since this is an activity that requires a high end CPU and memory, spam
control software and virus scanning software typically end up grinding
your machines to a halt or even slow down your legitimate e-mails.

Also there is the very scary possibility of losing e-mails due to false
positives.

My product 'anjal' uses the technique called greylisting. This is a very
smart way to combat spam since it is stopped right at the MTA level.
Since this never reads e-mail it is also very fast and highly efficient.
It is impossible to get a false positive here though the first mail from
a domain will experience a delay.

Basically greylisting forces mail servers to be RFC 2821 compliant and
retry mails until the receiving site is ready. This also has an added
advantage of hurting spammers sometimes and also stopping the spam that
is meant for some other sites.

The architecture of our solution is something like this.

						     +----------------+

Here is a schematic to explain how anjal works.

The firewall that works in anjal redirects e-mail traffic depending on
three parameters - 
	a) sending IP address (From IP)
	b) envelope sender (who sends you mail?)
	c) envelope recipient (who is mail addressed to?)

If the above '3 tuple' are seen for the first time then the mail sender
is subjected to the torturous SPAMD filtering (running on port 8025
above). There is a phenomenon called 'initial stuttering' that happens
here. Instead of talking at full speed the MTA accepts mail one
character at a time. This will piss off spammers and many go away. But
legitimate senders have just one mail to send. Moreover they have to be
RFC compliant. So they survive the test.

Once this process is completed, any subsequent mails from this sending
IP address is assumed to be legitimate and they directly talk to the
company mail server.

This in a nutshell is what my antispam solution does.

And you don't waste your storage space and bandwidth receiving spam
first and then rejecting them.

Overall a very brilliant idea no doubt.

Anyway as a bonus this also stops all sorts of irritating malware like
virses, Trojans, worms and other annoyances. Such mails usually
propagate with reckless abandon and my firewall running in anjal can
rate limit them. 

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

That was not a document written for public consumption but then that
should give you the context for what I am going to say now.

And that is what counts.

Spam control is really not that hard if you understand how spammers do
their job.

There is a lot of difference between the way spammers send out mail and
the way legitimate mailers send.

Let me give you a real life analogy.

Assume that you run a hotel that serves Masal Dosai.

If you have only ten customers in a day you have all the time to make a
perfect Dosa for everyone. You spend the time required for preparing a
proper Dosa. 

But instead if you have to deliver 200 Dosais to a party and you only
have two hours. What do you do? And the quality really does not count
since most people may order something else or not eat your Dosa at all.

In such a situation you will be aiming for speed and automation.

Not quality.

This is what happens with spam senders.

Spam sending botnets (which are programs) send out e-mails in bulk. And
their business is really dependent on volume. Even if one person in a
million clicks on a p0rn site or is stupid enough to opt for some
pleasure enhancement pill or some such thing they are fine.


And spam is not only about this or Nigerian widows. It is a lot more
than that. Viruses and worms do not propagate one mail at a time.

This is precisely what we use for controlling spam by using OpenBSD
greylisting.

Remember OpenBSD greylisting is not some other greylisting.

This is something you have to realize. I feel sorry for people who think
that OpenBSD is not very different from linux.

It is not true. As simple as that.

Anyway now coming back to the point, my product was deployed in a high
pressure corporate environment. I did an ifstat and found that it was
getting impounded with mails like bullets spraying from an AK 47 rifle.

And much to my delight my hardware could withstand it. So could OpenBSD
of course.

You should also understand that my low end hardware would not even
withstand a fraction of this load had I gone in for an alternate spam
control strategy that involves content filtering in one way or other. No
matter if it uses heuristics or not.

Here are some even more interesting features.

	a) No false positives at all since this technique does not
differentiate between e-mails, only senders
	b) Spammers actually get hurt by this. So if everyone used
OpenBSD greylisting then spammers would go out of business. This is one
of the purpose of this mail. ;)
	c) Since greylisting pushes back mail to the spammer, we do not
accept spam even at an MTA level. This means that your bandwidth bills
and storage space is saved.

I can go on and on but you get the idea.

It is not a long time since my appliance was deployed but given their
incredibly high mail traffic and spam possibility, it is indeed quite
heart warming that not a single spam has slipped thro' yet.

So what are you waiting for? 

You should wait for the next issue of BSDmag, a Polish magazine where I
talk about setting up OpenBSD greylisting.

Or simply read the man page after installing OpenBSD.

 $ man 8 spamd

What MTA are you using in your openBSD black box?

How is openBSD greylisting different/better say from postfix+greylisting 
running on any *nix type platform?

How does grey listing circumvent, virii etc. that come from 
legitimate/trusted sources, from entering into the corporate 'net?

Not sure if this 'Net legend but I have heard that some spam software 
take this technique into account and retry the MTA at which point the 
email is accepted.

The principle behind greylisting is that the SMTP RFC allows for:
 a. temporary unavailability of resources on the mail server.
 b. certain time delays in responses from the mail server.

So the server maintains a record of known transactions in the form
	sender A -> recipient B.
If a new mail arrives and is *not* one of these known transactions,
then the delays as above are applied.

So a spambot that is willing to send messages slowly *can* get
messages through such greylisting technique.

Suppose that such a spambot is actually a virus. Due to the near
exponential spread of the virus, there is no need for it to be
"fast".

So, if a virus-writer knows about grey-listing and is willing to
patiently create a bot-net, greylisting _alone_ would be ineffective.

Regards,

Kapil.

OpenBSD greylisting uses a light weight smtp relay server
(spamd) that sits in front of your real smtp servers.

spamd works in combination with the pf firewall, and can greylist
and tarpit spammers.  Multiple spamd machines can also sync
their state and work nicely as a cluster.

Good point.  A single anti-spam technique alone cannot stop
all threats.  However, greylisting makes an excellent first line
of defense that cuts down the volume of email that needs to
be scanned by the other anti-spam layers.

BlackBerry Giving Encryption Keys to Indian Government

RIM encrypts e-mail between BlackBerry devices and the server the server with 256-bit AES encryption. The Indian government doesn't like this at all; they want to snoop on the data. RIM's response was basically: That's not possible. The Indian government's counter was: Then we'll ban BlackBerries. After months of threats, it looks like RIM is giving in to Indian demands and handing over the encryption keys.

The stuff they mention is beautiful,  perhaps at par with VM ware.

How ever i don't know the fundamentals of this and am posting this in the

(ovirt )existing on other distros as well?

Ovirt is a software appliance. Essentially it is a self consistent image 
that contains a stripped down version of Fedora bundled with a web 
application that uses ruby on rails, libvirt (http://libvirt.org), 
freeipa (http://freeipa.org) and dns/dhcp. The virtualization itself is 
built on top of KVM. The graphs are produced using collectd 
(http://collectd.org/).

If you are looking for virtualization applications, there are several of 
them at

http://et.redhat.com/page/Main_Page

If you have more questions on this, feel free to ask.

A lot of different virtualisation options exist depending on what you
want to do; start with the simple chroot all the way to full
emulation of an x86 on a powerpc or vice versa!

Here are some words to look out for in order to get you started:

	vserver, chroot, xen, qemu, parallels, colinux,
	user-mode-linux, schroot, openvz, jail, vmware

Probably others can add some more.

Kapil.

I have always been a huge fan of Container solutions. They provide very good
value if you are running the same OS as the host itself. Solaris Zones,
OpenVZ, Linux V-Server. Linux Containers are special they will be part of
every shipped Linux Kernel pretty soon. See http://lxc.sourceforge.net/ for
more details.

I contributed OpenVZ support for Libvirt mentioned by Rahul, although there
is still lots of work left to be done. I believe it is a good project and
has very good potential. Watch for it. There have been a few projects
announced based on that, but I can't remember any names. It has bindings for
Python, Ruby, etc.

I also wrote an application called EasyVZ (GPL) that can be used to manage

Interesting. Do you use any libraries to talk to OpenVZ? One of the 
reasons libvirt was written was to avoid being dependent on a single 
virtualization technology for higher level management applications. As 
you might have realized already, it adds up complexity quickly.

I developed EasyVZ well before libvirt was usable. And anyways libvirt did
not have support for OpenVZ when I wrote EasyVZ. In EasyVZ's case, both the
client and the server are written in Python. So, I was quickly done with
with the project. After finishing it, I wrote the OpenVZ driver for libvirt,
which was of course in C.

Might consider integrating the higher level features into virt-manager.

That would take advantage of the openvz driver and you would save a lot 
of time and effort maintaining a application from scratch.

=============================

mkdir -- MaKe DIRectories.

Summary :

mkdir create the directories with the specified names, only if they
do not already exist.

Examples :

$ mkdir dir1 -- Create a dir1, if dir1 is NOT an existing file or
                a directory.

$ mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3 -- Create 3 directories.

$ mkdir -m 744 dir1 -- Create a dir1 with specified permission mode.

$ mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3 -- Make any missing parent directories for
                             each argument. Suppose if dir1 or dir2 is
                             NOT exist, then that dir will be created
                             before creating the dir3.

$ mkdir -v dir1/dir2/dir3 -- Print a message for each created dir.

Read : man mkdir

Yeah, I have considered that. But since container systems are drastically
different from full machine virtualization, there will be a lot of
development to do. Since EasyVZ already does the most common tasks, it is
easy to just add a few features users are asking for. Well anyway, I don't
have the time right now to do either. I was just trying to see if someone
will come forward to do these for me :D

I'd suggest any new development to be based on libvirt and products around
it happily.

Sites like cohesiveft.com provide custom virtual images. They provide
virtual images for lamp, ROR and many more stacks. They support
various virtualization platforms including vmware, zen, Amazon
{small,large,ex-large}. All you need is a player to use these images.
I'm not sure if they are ready for production use, but a best bet to
evaluate the offering based on your requirement.

Check out http://es.cohesiveft.com/ website for details.

They do provide image which could be deployed in Google App Engine.
I've not verified it, if anyone else does, please share your
experience.

On the open source front, the dotproject project is a good open source
project management tool. It does provide neat tools to track the
lifetime of a project. It does provide Gantt chart, not sure if it
does provide any other variety of charts. You can check-out the online
demo  www.dotproject.net/demo (userid: guest; pass: guest). I'm also
not sure if it has a plugin to integrate with M$ Project.

On the commercial front, you can take a look at one of offering from
CollabNet, CollabNet Enterprise Edition! It comes with various tools
including the one for project management. It also have a plugin to
integrate with M$ Project. You can also use 15 user limited edition
for free.

Thanks for your responses.  Took a quick look at the products all of you 
responded with.

From their description, they are most suited for software development.  
dotproject is general purpose but does not have PERT/CPM charting.

I should have clarified that the app. will be used in the manufacturing 
vertical.

Hi All,

Thanks for the response.
how ever, what i am looking for is some thing from the open source world
that is capable of what VM Ware is doing, that is moving virtual servers
from hosts  in Live production environments. Since my work area is SAN this
is of interest to me. I don't think that the chroot or even the BSD jails
can come close to that.
Which one of the above options mentioned is more robust in terms of
mplementation. iread that both Xen and  oVirt can do it. but have no idea.

Regards
Raj

The website doesn't mention the price as Rs 25000 anywhere. They have said
they are yet to receive the final price tag from Acer.

I have looked at the desktop version which claims MS Proj. 
compatibility; tried to open the bundled sample projects w/o success.

Thanks for pointing out the hosted version.  Although, I was aware of it 
I did not look into that possibility :(  I need to host it on my server 
though, anyway I will contact their staff for that possibility.

In my earlier attempts, it was able to open the sample files in Gantt 
Chart mode.  It barfed on "View> Network" of the samples.

It worked today :)

Anyway, my main interest is in a browser based app. so that individuals 
can update their tasks over the 'Net  and the PM can monitor the 
project's progress w/o inputs in the form of email, phone messages, SMS 
etc.

Agreed. Infact, one of the reasons why I turned to Google's hosted
account. No matter where I host, I would never get the advantage of
carrying my mails all over the world without the need for my own PC /
laptop to be around. Secondly, I won't have to pay for the storage of
my mails (which is currently at 3Gigs).

Of course, there is the risk of google hosted account going paid.
Don't see it happening yet. They need my user-behaviour data to
improve their ad system, no? ;)

*phew* That's a pretty good deal. Does being an IIT-ian qualify me? I
study in Chennai, but IIT doesn't come under the TN education board.

Subject: [Ilugc] [xpost] Epson LX1050+ printing with very small fonts.
Message-ID: <200806252230.31719.knura@yahoo.com>

OS: Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Gnome desktop.

Over the phone, I walked a client, through the printer installation of 
Epson LX1050+ printer.  During installation, I asked him to chose the 
recommended driver for the LX1050 that comes bundled with CUPS and to 
print a test page.  The test page printed fine.

Now he is complaining that it is printing very small fonts irrespective 
of the application i.e. Firefox, OO Writer.

This is the first time I have installed a dot matrix printer (and that 
too by proxy). Logically, things should print per font settings in the 
application if the test page prints.

I would appreciate any pointers to what printer settings I should be 
looking for to fix the problem.

Thanks in advance.

Friends.

What about Job Opportunities for PHP in Enterprise Organizations?

How they use PHP?

Is PHP for only SME's?

A PHP Beginner asked me.

What do you think?


Thanks.

>>What about Job Opportunities for PHP in Enterprise Organizations?

PHP has a very hot market now-a-days.


>>How they use PHP?

Ofcourse, for web applications and haven't heard any company doing business with it other than web applications.

>>Is PHP for only SME's?

I do agree SME's use it extensively, but larger companies have also start to trust PHP.
As a employee of a CMMi level 4 company, i see quite a lot of bigger client's projects being done in PHP.
so, i don't see any reason, why he shouldn't start of with php.

Being an IIT-ian can qualify you for a number of things, but I'm yet to hear
of someone being disqualified for it :)

I inferred from the "Who can apply" link that the bottomline is that one
needs to be a student studying IN Tamil Nadu.
That seems to be the only prerequisite.

Even studnets enrolled with Tamil Nadu open university are qualified.
So I guess even students of other states can apply!

But you never know :-) IIT might be considered too ivy league for this offer ;-)

Hi all,
 First of all sorry for cross-posting the same query on so many lists.
 I read somewhere couple of days ago that Bill Gates actually got his
source-code from some trash-bin or something like that or some part of
it.

I don't remember the website or any of the details and the history of
my browser doesn't hack it (meaning got no help) . Also googling
didn't get me anywhere.

So if this story is true, can somebody point a URL to look it up.

Thanks N.Padmanathan for your tip.  I will certainly give it a try.

This is my first experience with dot matrix printers :)  Never ran into

I would hire someone who has mastered the theory and fundamentals
at a university and then focused his/her own effort in adapting and
applying that knowledge in the real world.

In short, you need both the university degree as well as ones own
effort.

Wikipedia is not even a substitute for text books, let alone a CS degree.

In India-

* Students going to universities choose CS degree because they can have a
better career (of course there will be exceptions)
* Self taught programmers have more passion and in most cases their career
is because of their interest in computer science.

I am an employer and always prefer self taught programmers.

It depends on the requirements. I would look for solid computer science
fundamentals which includes a very good knowledge of data structures,
different programming paradigms, the ability to analyse space and time order
complexities etc. Self-taught programmers may become very good at some
particular technology, but am very sure they would not have the requisite
knowledge on computing basics and fundamentals, because it's not something
very crucial for being a programmer. But how long is one going to be a
programmer? The skills I quoted become very valuable and crucial, once you
start moving up the value chain.

Back to you original question, the fitment depends on a set of requirements
for a particular position. I wouldn't really be deciding based on what and
how they have studied but based on what they have done and what they think
they can do(obviously they have to prove that during the interview)

my very humble 0.02$

My take:

Wikipedia, google et al are like a HDD - with very very large seek
times. To get any useful work done (by taking decisions in real time)
you have to have the stuff in RAM - on demand! A college education
populates your RAM with most of the basics. With that foundation you
can leverage the internet to solve bigger problems.

Would you allow a person operate on you by consulting Wikipedia ;-) or
would you prefer one whose RAM has been crammed with 8 years of
college education and hands on experience.

I  have another question. A lot of people employed in Y domain are 
actually from other domains, especially in India's IT companies we have 
more people from Electronics, Electrical, Mechanical, Production, Civil 
put together than Computer Science and IT. Most of us (as in out 
companies) end up hiring a non-computer guy. How does this fit into the 
scenario? Myself coming from Electrical and Electronics background and 
half of my colleagues too coming from non-engineering background, I 
somehow feel non-CS or non-IT have been more successful with IT jobs 
than their CS/IT peers.

Just my 2 paisas!

server-1 (192.168.1.227)
i get the following error

1, check whether  you could ping the mysql server
2. if you could through step1 then check mysql privilege for  the user

             Please see if the DB exists, because thats what the error
message says "Cannot select DB" . Though trivial, please do see if by
chance the mysql server process has stopped running.

I ran across the same problem some time back.

Check what is in "bind-address" on your my.cnf file.  If it is localhost or 127.0.0.1,
change it to 192.168.8.200. Now restart the mysql server and try it again.

Hi,

IMHO:

I think the matter is more of interest rather than degrees. Among those who
are ambitious enough to want to go up the industry's value chain, the
degree-getters do so by doing more advanced degrees and proving their
ability through research and the self taught types, do so by taking up
challenging projects and learning things as they work. Since they are very
interested, they are also able to match their counterparts who have degrees.


I somehow tend to believe that those who do Ph.Ds and advance the field by
their research are better than the self taught ones (so they might be the
ones that I would employ if I were an employer :D), but this is more or less
subjective to me.

To answer your question about non-CS people doing relatively better, I think
it appears so because the average non-CS person is more interested in the
field than the average CS person, simply because the average CS person did
his/her degree because it was the "in" thing and not because they were
interested, and the average non-CS person learned everything required for
the job on their own (purely based on interest).

You can use the same argument to state that CS/IT peers will do well
in other engineering fields in the Industry. Vomiting of answers, or
percentage of marks does not count in the Industry (bureaucracy is an
exception).

I would prefer to work with people who have their basics (or
fundamental know-how) set right - whether it comes from college
education or experience, doesn't really matter.

I think we would all agree with this. The "fundas" must be OK.

The two points of disagreement would be what the "fundas" are and how
does one check that the "fundas" are right. 

The difficulty about irregular learning is that one does not know
what has been missed.

This is why there is a university --- to give a universal (as in
all-round) education. Thus a certificate from a university is
supposed to show that "nothing basic has been missed".

Unfortunately, after a while, the university becomes a "certifying
authority". The teachers find it easier to just follow the
book and the students figure out how to do just enough to do
the exams. "Education" in a real sense is given the go by.

At that point it becomes important to get someone else to certify
that the student is capable of "research" or learning/creating on
their own. This leads to internships --- which is like vocational
training. However, if someone did an intern-ship in a super-computing
centre, what confidence do I have that that leads to a good
application developer or mathematician?

... and so the cycle starts again.

Regards,

Kapil.

I know this for sure that when the PC's ethernet card is connected to 
the DSL modem/router's ethernet port in "bridge" mode, the WAN IP 
appears on the PC's NIC i.e. the PC become visible on the 'Net.

Likewise, is the same true when the PC is connected to the DSL 
modem/router using the USB ports on the respective devices?  

To the best of my knowledge the answer is yes but need to confirm it 
from the device gurus :)

I have been programming for the past 9 years and learning languages,
scripting etc all the time. I took a CS degree because I am interested
in computers but i didn't learn much in college as i have learned
before and after college. Colleges don't teach people how to do real
time work. Self learned programmers are more passionate in their jobs,
I am not talking out people who work and learned for just a job, but
about people who are really passionate about programming and
computers.

There is more of an interest and passion there than self learned and
college taught. Hiring managers should look for people who have the
interest and the passion to work rather than degree and just
theoretical knowledge.

Want to add one more thing.  I have worked for 10+ years in a Fortune 
500 Telecom R&D labs.  Some of the better software engineers, had 
MS/Ph.Ds in disciplines that had nothing to do with traditional 
computer science curriculum.  The HR in that company was open to 
inviting people with "potential" (the interview process was quite 
grilling).

Correct. However, very few router vendors for DSL offer bridged mode  
on ethernet connect, when I saw last. USB by default bridges DSL and  
USB.

Thanks for the confirmation.  My DLink DSL502T (about 2 yrs. old) does 
offer bridge mode on the ethernet port.  Perhaps they have discontinued 
in the newer models.

IMO, specific to practice of medicine, this opens a can of different 
worms.  The greed that I have seen amongst the "specialist" is vulgar.

Anyway, here we are talking about software.  It is always tested 
(presumably) before it is deployed reducing the risk factor.  In 
mission critical situation, it is typically certified by a competent 
3rd party.

Ihave been on some interview panel of 2 of the top 5 Indian IT service
companies. These guys get millions of resumes a day. The size of the
company is also so big that there has to be a minimum set of standards
to prevent mal-practice. So, the qualification becomes a filtration
criteria. People will be selected if and only if they show the correct
aptitude, teamwork capabilities, etc... Depends on the person who is
interview. But still its not 100% fool proof.

Unfortunately in todays education it is like RAM - temporary - vanishes when switched off i.e when exams are over.

I have to agree with Shakthi. I believe college education imparted on
students is as good as the people who teach it. Forget the top technical
institutions. Take colleges that churn out more than 80% of the engineers.
The poor lecturers there are still there because they were unlucky enough to
get into the IT industry. Given a chance, they will run so fast, their heels
will hit their bottoms. I have a bunch of resumes from lecturers who want to
come into the "industry". I could not help them much because after sending
the resume, they also asked me which course to take so they will become
employable. Well, what can you tell them? The salaries offered by many
colleges to lecturers are shamefully paltry.

It is a weird world out there. They call a bank account with sufficient
balance as "decent". As if there were an indecent balance.

Just think about the quality of education these guys are capable of
imparting. How will they inspire their students? Poor parents, when in
school, extra tutions, when out of school, extra entrance coaching and when
in engineering college, extra NIIT and Aptech.

As far as learning the basics is concerned, any smart wannabe programmer can
go pick up a copy of SICP* or Knuth from any damn book shop two streets
away. There is no stopping anyone who wants to learn, really. You got the
stuff out there and you got your computer. You can start writing those
programs and test and accuracy of your microprocessor. The best thing about
books in India is that they are a whole lot cheaper that in Western
countries. (Read, Eastern Economy Edition)

I have yet to see a CS or IT graduate who knows the basics of  
anything. All they know is tools, so as far as the opensource world  
is concerned they are useless - only fit for proprietary sweatshops  
where knowledge of tools is all that is required. Self taught is the  
only way to go. And I have 'trained' any number of people who I  
wouldnt even employ as peons who are drawing huge salaries today for  
the sole reason that, in addition to the tools, a small bit of the  
opensource culture has rubbed off on them

Even Newton (who was definitely *not* a nice guy) admitted that he

Politics, marketing and economics are a part of Life that influences
innovation and research. Since most of us live for the latter we
despise this interference!

However, not all of these influences are negative. For example,

One of the reasons for this is that most of the universities in India
are Teaching Institutions rather than Research Institutions. By
steering the Indian academia towards a research focus, the students
would definitely grasp the basic and fundamentals better.

Really? I thought they were assembly lines for creating certificate

The confrontation between teaching and research is (IMNSHO) entirely
artificial.

looks like this modem is not linux compatible - try with knoppix live  
cd and see if it is detected. I find the tataindicom usb modem works  
out of the box with linux

I don't think there is a confrontation at all. I was merely responding
to KG's comment that the emphasis is on training students to
use/develop with a tool rather than being adept with the basics.

Someone once told me the importance of learning assembly by saying
each time I do a printf, I should know what effect it has on my
system. I'd say the inquisitiveness the advice instilled in me helped
me quite a bit.

I have seen good research using C, Fortran, Python, ... So I don't know
what you are talking about! :-)

Seriously, I feel too much is made of the language aspect. Just as it
is easier to program in (say) Python if you have learnt C really well,
I think it is easier to speak/write well in English if you have really
learnt (say) Tamil well.

Having taught American students who struggle to express simple logical
statements in English (American) and Bengali students who have exactly
the same difficulties --- I can assure you that it is the lack of
ability to think logically (in their Mother Tongue or any other
language) that is the source of their difficulties rather than the
lack of English.

Today a number of contributors to FLOSS come from areas like South
America, Eastern Europe and Japan. All of them try to communicate
what they need to in English --- or they say it with code.

this is my experience also - specifically how many people who come  
from tamil medium (substitute any other Indian language) can write a  
coherent page of matter in their mother tongue? I have taught many  
people whose written english was miserably, but their written tamil  
was as bad if not worse.

it is not at all OT - just a reflection of the difference between  
FOSS which is the home of the self taught type, and proprietary which  
is the home of the other type.

Kumar Appiah who is the latest Deb Developer from Chennai is also a EEE.
Most legends of the day were EEE grads too. CS and IT are relatively new. It

each of sharing our own experiences. all can be true. :-)

well, my line of thought was simply in spite of talent, i have had friends
who were ignored  or made to put ten/ hundred time more effort to attain
something which is generally felt as success.

and very little (zero) opportunity is there for such talents in the current
scenario may it be academics or research..

nothing more to continue on this, in this thread.

My thoughts exactly. While the community is ripe with counter examples
(Con Kolivas. Anesthetist + Kernel Hacker), among friends (and myself),
I find that the general self-learned programmer, is more capable of
doing um, 'program design', then 'algorithm design'. 

I also find that these days, it's so much easier to pass off without
those core CS elements; there are almost always libraries that do what
you want to do. With them, it just takes a little presence of mind and
experience to choose the right algorithm and data structure.

Hi,

I searched for ILUGC in wikipedia and could not find it. I went ahead
and created a stub article. You can access the this link and make
modifications

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_lug

Since it is only a stub article the article is marked for deletion. If
we could bring up content and relevant internal and external
references on wikipedia we can get it through to wikipedia. ILUG-Delhi
is already is on wikipedia and I believe ILUGC deserves to be there
too.

Cheers
Anoop

We are also looking forward to people who can help us in generating
necessary funds for publishing, finding a suitable publisher for publishing,
marketing the book across Tamilnadu and other places.

Do you envision the content to be different from what is on ILUG-Chennai 
web site?  If not, then I fail to see the point.  ILUG-Chennai shows up 
in Google search.

They are many many LUGs around the world, they have not rushed to 
wikipedia.  

To me, wikipedia is the equiv. of an encyclopedia i.e. source of 
information on subject matters.

It has a definition of a generic LUG and that is sufficient IMO.

My 2 paise.

not true - if they have talent they will succeed - I know hundreds of  
europeans whose mother tongue is not english and many Indians whose  
mother tongue is not english and who have succeeded. Dont forget,  
germans for example, study in german medium and succeed. Linus  
Torwald's mother tongue is swedish, he studied in finnish medium and  
he succeeded. And don't forget all the bengalis who have studied in  
bengali medium and have succeeded.

Jeyakesavan Veerasamy, a big name in CS research now, was from a tamil
medium school. During the first few months in college he was always
found with a speak english in 30 days kind of book - without a care to
the fun the rest of us were making of him! By the second semester he
had shut us all up by writing an anti-virus software that became the
de facto standard in AU and IIT campus.

Well said.  As the saying goes "Where there is a will there is a way"  

I personally know a lawyer who represents India in the Int'l Bar Assoc.  
When he first came to Mumbai, he spoke broken English (mother tongue 
Gujarati).  Today, he is the *top* lawyer on rent act in Mumbai and hob 
knobs with legal big wigs visiting India.  He puts a monthly news 
letter as well.

This applies to any field, including programmers.

I am sure almost every one in this list can remember one or two teachers
(mostly working in the other way) who had inspired them. If we think of the
no. of students each of us interact with, how many"passes"  and how many
drop outs (by the teacher or by the student)?

I hope we do not get into the trap that various ideologies got into -- as if
they are the ONLY panacea for all the ills. FOSS uses the experience gained
from time immemorial -- sharing and developing knowledge.  As a teacher or a
student, I would like to use/develop tools in the FOSS way, and not confine
FOSS to the home of the self taught type -- after all we are talking about
freedom.

the biggest hindrance to Tamil medium students is that they are  
afraid of people making fun of them for trying to learn english. An  
atmosphere created by politicians who keep insisting that Tamil be  
medium of instruction (while making sure that their children/ 
grandchildren study in english medium). And secondly they dont take  
the effort. I have been accused of being anti-tamil because I  
severely criticise most tamil translations I see. But the reason why  
I criticise them is that the translations are careless - I don't see  
tamil-english or english-tamil dictionaries on their tables. In order  
to learn a language, you need both way dictionaries as well as a  
thesaurus. When I was learning tamil I used to sit with a dictionary  
and a book - my progress used to be maybe one page an hour at the  
beginning. It is also necessary to learn by heart the meanings and  
keep practicing. I don't see any of this effort among the 'talented'  
people who are not being given the opportunity to succeed.

I still get furious every time I see 'free software' translated as  
'kattatra menporul'. Re-translate 'kattatra menporul' into english  
and see what you get. Or translating copyright as 'kaapurimai'. And  
the various ways the word 'license' is translated.

Your college was already heavily using FOSS atleast a while back. Refer

Seems like a good deal. But the real questions are ..
1. Who is the manufacturer.. ? Elcot had mentioned in their website that
they are evaluating both Acer and Dell. But it is not clear now who made the
cut. The manufacturer's name is mentioned in the config as "Multinational
brand commercial grade notebook computer *Model Name: ELCOT"
I am not sure how good is that? The only thing to do is to go in person and
evaluate, I guess.

So, if any of u guys see the laptop in person, can u pls comment on the
build/manufacturer ..etc. Some photos would be good too.. i.e if the elcot
people consent.

But isn't ilug-chennai a notably significant entity that deserves to
be on Wikipedia? I am not talking about advertising but as
encyclopedic content on how Foss evolved in India. ILUG Delhi is on
there, BLUG Banglore is on there, Shouldn't ILUGC be there too? I did

Which page, could you please pass on the URL.?

point is that wikipedia is *not* an encyclopedia - everything  
mentioned in wikipedia *has* to be referenced from original source  
material. So you can only talk about ILUGC in wikipedia if you can  
present external references to ILUGC - as far as I know, there are  
none apart from the ILUGC website. So let us work to make ILUGC  
famous, and then it will naturally come into wikipedia

just because other people break the policies of wikipedia, it does  
not mean that we should do so. As for the BLUG page, it is a disgrace  
as it has been put there to further the interests of one individual  
(also the foss.in page and the atul chitnis page). Please go through  
the discussions on these pages - older discussions as everyone has  
got fed up with discussing them and no longer does so. You will note  
that all the references in these three articles are to the website or  
to press statements given by the organisations involved.

put it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_India  <------- but  
even this does not have proper references.

Well, let me get my rant in too. When I first moved to Chennai, I was 
taken aback by the fact that _none_ of the bus stops have any signs in 
English! I mean, come on, you love your language and all, all power to 
you, but why trouble poor outsiders by not even writing the damn bus 
stop name in English?

I see the same problem with the traffic cops - they put up these huge 
boards with instructions on changed directions _only_ in Tamil! I'm all 
for native language lovin', but this is ridiculous.

Vamsee,

Do you really think bus stop names are written in "English" in Bangalore
(or) Hyderabad (or) for that matter in the NCR? I dont think so. I however
agree with you about traffic signs only in Tamizh. I hope that at the least
they would have marked the proper traffic symbols along with the
instructions.

As for knowing the bus stop name...You could just ask people in the bus stop
for the name of the stop while waiting to board a bus and I believe the
conductor in the bus always shouts the name of the stop at every bus stop,
for you to get down at the correct stop.

I know for a fact that situation is even worse in places like Delhi. Bombay
is different because of the fact that some huge percentage of the population
in that city is from outside maharashtra and hence all things "English" is a
given.

I haven't seen a single bus stop in bombay that displays the stop name
in English.
It took a few days for me to learn to read bus numbers because that is
also written in native language.

This is everywhere. But then.. are we ready to learn instead of complaining?

the situation is something like this,

2003, the industry was flop. every IT major was demanding > 75 percent mark
without any history of arrear and throughout the education (Class 10, 12,
graduation)

2004, it rose little.. anyone with 65 percent without any history of arrear
were enough..

its rose further,

anyone without standing arrear and 65% were eligible to apply..

its even better now..

i am hearing, even if you have arrear, its ok if you clear them when you
join us :-)

stop...

and most people selected were put to testing, maintenance and support..

one year of testing,  maintenance and support does unconsciously create in
them the conscious knowledge gained by a CS/ IT guy during their academic
study... there are different ways and means to express/ understand/ perceive
same thing na..

if your are lucky enough you get into programming straight through..

bench-desk-chair with full meals and salary are always there.. ;-)

I have been asking most of my friends? are you developing some thing at your
office?

very few say - yes

many say they prepare monthly report for the tickets they got for 24*7
support..

many are continuously maintaining that they are maintaining applications...

others say they stay at office, check whether few cron have run
successfuly.. test them once in a week..

and when they get right - left, back, packet and purses full of money for
this, why would even dream of programming :-)

IT industry is all about providing maintenance and support predominantly and
active development does happen, i do not deny..

it continues...

I know it's not the point, but just to be sure, please check the next 
time you visit Hyderabad, all the bus stop names will be mostly in 
English. Not even Telugu. It seems such a common courtesy that you 
accommodate people who don't know the language.

Well... come on... it gets tiring to depend on whoever is sitting next 
to you all the time... especially you don't even know how to speak the 
language. The point is, I'm sure it doesn't cost a lot of extra effort 
to do something as simple as writing some multi-lingual titles - and it 
will benefit a lot of people. You don't have to inconvenience people 
just to prove a point. Anyways. Way too OT :).

OK we can then try to do that first :-). I gave up on the wikipedia
attempt. The article was deleted by wikipedia admins :-)

I checked out that page, I don't think that it is relevant to put
ILUGC in there too.
So let this topic RIP until ILUGC has enough relevant links from
external sources.
