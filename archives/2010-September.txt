 Does your motherboard have PS/2 ports for keyboard and mouse?  What
kind of keyboard are you using PS/2 or USB?

For the latter case, does your computer BIOS have any settings for USB
input devices; are they enabled?

You need to provide as much info as possible about your hardware to
avoid 20 questions.

I do not know what could be the problem but please bear in mind ...

You upgraded from a _released_ product 10.04 to a _development_
product 10.10 which is in alpha3
<http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/maverick/alpha3>.

> How could I solve this problem??

Alpha and Beta versions are meant for testing and flushing out bugs;
which is what you have ended up doing.  It may be worthwhile
participating in the Ubuntu development forums and bring this problem
to the developer's attention.

I don't know if I understood your requirement/query correctly.
Assuming that you want to parse access_log file such that for every
host entry in the access_log, you want to group corresponding fields
together as a set of records, the code could be something like
below:

# --------------8<---------------------------------8<---------------
require 'rubygems'
require 'apachelogregex'
require 'pp'

format = '%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"'
parser = ApacheLogRegex.new(format)
access_log = Hash.new
# Creating a hash of an array of hashes!
# Can be simplified based on your actual requirement.

File.readlines('aleurier_access.log').collect do |line|
  record = parser.parse(line)
  # The code below does the actual job. Can be a one-liner
  # if you know ternary operators or maybe if expression.
  if access_log.key? record["%h"]
     access_log[record["%h"]] << record
  else
     access_log[record["%h"]] = Array.new
  end
end

# Now let's test some!
puts access_log.keys
while true
    print "Enter ip address: "
    ipaddr = gets.chomp
    puts "-" * 40
    pp access_log[ipaddr]
    puts "-" * 40
end
# --------------8<---------------------------------8<---------------

Is this what you wanted ?

It is a PS2 keyboard and my motherboard does have PS2 settings enabled. The
problem occurs randomly but its irritating enough to restart it once, in
order to get the keyboard working.

Also, I dont think its a problem with my keyboard not getting detected as
such. Since, on the LILO prompt I am able to choose the desired OS to boot
into and press the <ENTER> key. It is just that, by the time I reach the
Ubuntu login prompt, my keyboard input is not accepted anymore.

As for more info, my machine runs on an AMD Athlon x64 dual core processor
with M2N-MX SE mobo, and my keyboard is a very old compaq model - SK-2800C
(if that helps). Considering that, Do any of you experience similar problems
with Ubuntu, or is it just my keyboard wearing out ?

I have seen many cases i have seen hardware that works only on
windows. Also sometimes after a update some things may stop working.
This happens rarely in windows, but they do happen even on windows. So
it always helps to have dual boot with windows just to clear out this
type of issues. I find in my case most hardware related issues are
figured out by just booting into windows when we have problem in linux
and vice-versa. Although you may not use windows it still helps to
have one to rule out possiblites. I dont think keyboard issue will
solved by booting into windows, b'cos keyboard is a basic
functionality and PS/2 keyboard have been around for a long time. So
most likely it is cause of ware out. Just trying connecting to another
machine and rule out the possibilities.

It could be a random hardware problem that manifests randomly.

Try another distro like Debian or Fedora (Live CD will do) and see if
the problem persists.

With old keyboards I have experienced problems with certain key
strokes nothing like your problem.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimsqe45hCUrSDO=m0TH9Z=2RJ2C5-LKAedw1rYJ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear boys and girls,

If you wish to play back the sequence of commands you type at the
console you can always use script(1)
which starts a new shell and gives the commands you type.

But it is dumb and can't understand command sequences.

It doesn't really play back. It only records and lets you know what
all commands you typed.

But with ttyrec(apt-get install ttyrec) and ttyplay you can actually
get the real video. ;)

It is a funny sort of video that plays in the console. Try it out. It
understands colors,  it is really really cool. ;)

For instance,

$ ttyrec out.tty

<Type commands>

$ <Ctrl-d> (exit shell)

Now play back what you typed in the speed you typed.

$ ttyplay out.tty

I wonder what the video format is.

If you can convert it into mp4 for the web with ffmpeg or something it
is still better.

I have done screencast recording with ffmpeg before. That can capture
X but ttyrec only deals with text.

-Girish

My friend had _exactly_ this problem on a laptop about half a year ago.
I do believe installing a newer kernel (perhaps from karmic-backports)
solved the problem in his case. Have you tried this?

Good luck,

Dear all,

On behalf of ILUGC, myself conducted a one day awareness program on FOSS in
Angel College of Engineering and Technology, Tiruppur (
http://angelindia.com/acet/) on 31/08/10 for the Third and Final year CSE/IT
students totalling 200+.

Mr M.Nageswara Guptha - HOD/CSE, United Institute of Technology, Coimbatore
(www.uit.ac.in) who was the Chief Guest inaugurated the Angel FOSS Club.

30 seat FOSS lab was setup in the college using Fedora-13. Also distributed
copies of Fedora-13, OpenSuSE-11.3, Ubuntu-10.04, Edubuntu-10.04,
LinuxMint-9 DVDs to the students.

I would like to thank the Principal, HOD of CSE/IT for the support in
organizing the program.

yes exactly this is what I want to do.

I tried this way it runs fine


require 'rubygems'
require 'apachelogregex'
require 'set'
require 'pp'

urls = Set.new
format = '%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}\"'
  parser = ApacheLogRegex.new(format)
  File.readlines('aleurier_access.log').collect do |line|
  l = parser.parse(line)
   urls.add(l["%r"])
      # {"%r"=>"GET /blog/index.xml HTTP/1.1", "%h"=>"87.18.183.252", ... }
end
puts urls.to_a.sort
pp l

but I still get an error.
undefined local variable or method `l' for main:Object (NameError)
 I tried using @l but no use

Thanks alot

I have also experienced this problem a few years ago with CentOS 4.x running 
on HP4xxx workstations. HP documented this as happening with ps2 keyboard and 
usb mouse (both ps2 or both usb worked fine). The temporary fix was to switch 
to both usb or both ps2 and it got sorted out after kernel updates.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] HTML5 microdata vocabularies
Message-ID: <AANLkTinMKhfpCFNyHhDXq+HuqXEDaRadyHhu2GbNGm-G@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
HTML5 [1] introduces a new simple way of annotating web pages to make them
semantic - the microdata [2]. Microdata annotates the DOM with scoped
name/value pairs from custom vocabularies. Thus a web page can be made
readable even by machines, without much strain for the web designer.
Such custom vocabularies are in a primitive stage with only a few such as
Event <http://data-vocabulary.org/Event>,
Organization<http://data-vocabulary.org/Organization>,
Person <http://data-vocabulary.org/Person>,
Product<http://data-vocabulary.org/Product>,
Review <http://data-vocabulary.org/Review>. But web pages may contain
contents about various other entities. Defining such vocabularies is a part
of my project (which involves semantic annotation of Wiki). I need a list of
such classes which needs to be defined so. If you feel that a particular
class of objects are used widely in web pages and needs vocabulary
definition, please share it here so  that I can develop them and give it
back to the society.

Dear All,
       I have a transparent squid proxy server, there all the 80 ports has
been redirected to 3128. But, when I disable particular sites such as
.gmail.com..etc, it is not blocking.

Example: http://www.gmail.com => it throws error
                https://www.gmail.com => I am able to login ( I should block
this sites ).

I have googled and spent a lot of time on this, not able to restrict that.
Please any one help me how to do that.

censorship attempts shouldn't be helped in an LUG i guess. ;-)

Seriously though, https connections are not made through port 80. They use
SSL at 443.

You will either have to block all https sites or allow all of them if
you want to keep the transparent proxy.
Otherwise, you can't use transparent proxy if you want to restrict
some https sites and allow others.

Google for transparent proxy + https :)

May be a library card catalog? It will contain properties like author
name(s), book name, subject,
subject type(ie Dewey/LC system), ISBN etc. Go see your college library

Cooking time was one of the properties. ;-)
It has none for Book Catalog though.

Yes, too bad. Google thinks that recipes are more important to be
semantically marked up than a book catalog?
The vocabularies already available and supported by Google includes
  Recipe
  Review
  Review aggregate
  Person
  Event
  Organization
  Product

The objects that we have identified to be defined are:
  Book
  Movie
  Vehicle
  Image
  Terminology
  Software
  Weather
  GNU/Linux distro

I'll add Book catalog to the list. More suggestions will help in making
search a nice experience  :-)

Birla Planetarium authorities have categorically stated that no commercial company/activities  at SFD. 

You are welcome to have the stall as ILUGC volunteers without bringing any commercial entity in display/talk.

Also if I remember right wordpress and sugarcrm was already proposed by a college team ( I don't remember who they are -- please raise your hands). First preference should always go to students - in my opinion.

I was going to suggest blocking https connections with iptables (for
2.6.x kernel).

I am glad you researched and found a solution.   However, you will
have to do this for *every* https site that you want blocked.

Also, please trim your quotations and avoid top posting.

Hello everyone,
My apologies for the spam, but just in case you can spare some time this
September end/October beginning, here is a message from the IITM LUG about
our biggest FOSS event.
Regards,
Kirtika B R
IITM LUG


===================================================
Hi!

It's time to get ready for the largest (and only) FOSS event at
Shaastra 2010, the annual technical fest of IIT Madras. We, from the
Shaastra team, proudly present to you 'Hackfest'...

What is Hackfest all about?
Hackfest is more than a FOSS event. To us, it's a movement to gather
enthusiastic programmers together and get them on the tracks of open
source development. It teaches them the sleight of the developer's
hand and gives them a chance to peek into the world of development.

Hackfest's Objective:
Our primary objective is to help the participants take their first
steps into the world of contribution to open source.

Past glories:
Over the past two years Hackfest has been a fantastic way to gather
enthusiastic programmers together and get them started on contributing
to open source projects. It gave an opportunity for the participants
to learn what separates developers from regular users and coders and
to interact with the Indian open source community.
In the previous editions of the Hackfest, participants have fixed bugs
and have even got patches! This has had a lasting effect; some of the
participants have enthusiastically begun to contribute to their
favorite Open Source projects, and are participating in this year's
GSoC.

What's new this year?
This year, Hackfest is back with a lot of new stuff to offer. Some of
the projects that the participants will be hacking on this year are
Google Android, Gnome, KDE, Git, Kernel, Mozilla and Minix.

Registrations are open. Please hurry up and register @
http://www.shaastra.org/2010/userportal/events/register/Hackfest
(You will need to create an account on the Shaastra userportal first)

For more information,visit
http://www.shaastra.org/2010/main/events/coding/hack_fest

Hope to see you there!
"May the source be with you..."

If most of them are b/w prints, then you might want to consider laser
printers.  Price points are @ Rs. 6K, the "starter" cartridge gives
about 1500 pages which should last you for about 4 years and you don't
have to worry about cartridges drying up.

For color prints, I take the files in PDF format to the local "xerox" shop.

I use HP deskjet F4288 and i am able to scan and take print outs in Ubuntu even without installing the HP ?driver. I guess this would be the case even for other Linux distros.
HP F4288 is now succeeded by F4488 and it can be used for print-scan-copy(xerox).The cost is approx Rs.3550/-

I use a HP Deskjet F2235 (All-in-one) printer which works fine with my
Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux. It can print scan and xerox. It was Rs.
3990/- 2 years back, but I dont think this model is in market right
now, but F4288 is the advanced and latest version of this model which
is currently available in market as someone have mentioned else
thread.

hth. Thank You.

First of all you might want to try 11.3 which was released in July/10.
 Many Xorg enhancements have been incorporated into it.  For example
the native open source driver for ATI Radeon now supports 3D
acceleration for my laptop's HD 4200 chipset and I am have KDE 4.x
composite and special effects; until 11.2 I had to use ATI's blob
driver to get the same effects.

Also IIRC, Chrome from VIA has not been well supported in Xorg and
neither have I seen VIA release any blob drivers although they claim
Linux support; this was about 18 months ago when I was researching
their embedded boards for an application.

I would suggest the following:

1. Contact VIA support and tell them about your dilemma - (no
assurance of solving your problem).  Also next time please research
Linux support for any hardware before buying and save yourself some
time by avoiding chasing such issues.
2. Read  this <http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=636206>
(extracted from Google with keywords "xorg driver  K8M890CE" - I hope
you had tried it).  This might help solve your problem.
3. Put in an external graphics card that is well supported by Xorg.
Most motherboards have a PCI-express slot for external video card,
besides the embedded video controller. (you may get a fully functional
setup with hardware acceleration for 3D)

hi,

in translation of strings what number to people use. English has the
word 'you' with no plural form. In indian languages we have singular and
plural for both pronouns and verbs - we usually use the plural to be
polite or show respect. In doing tamil translation it sounds a bit rude
to use 'nee'(you in singular) instead of 'neengal'(you in plural - or to
show respect). How about other languages?

(I hope I do not get chucked for using two tamil words)

AFAIK this applies to all Indian Languages.

Indic Languages use the plural as a mark of respect. (Don't ask my why :-P )

that does not answer my question - I know all Indian languages have
that. What I am asking is which form we use when translating strings?

I would suggest that you use the plural form. That way, though the NextGen
would find it amusing, you won't offend anyone :-)

I have been doing a small amount of Hindi translation for a FOSS
project (mainly due to the absence of other volunteers), and I have
tried to stay with the style of earlier contributors, who have done a
fairly good job. The general trend seems to be to use "aap"
(equivalent of "neengal"); my reasoning as to why it makes sense is
since this word doubles for the case of plural as well as respect, as
opposed to "nee".

Someone with a better perspective could correct me, if I am wrong,
though.

Thanks.

Kumar

I wish you stick to our own way of speaking/writing. In my opinion we need translation and not transliteration.

not my way. String translation is the computer speaking to a person. For
example the most common string is 'go'. So do we translate that as 'po'
or 'chel' or 'pohngal' 'chellungal'. (hindi 'ja' or 'jahiye')? If your
computer said 'po' to you instead of 'pohngal' would you feel insulted?

Yes, I will feel insulted. We cannot and should not change basics of our languages for the sake of machines.

well if some one close to me uses the singular mode of talking I will
not feel insulted - so you mean that our interaction with machines
should be more formal?

but machines are not human beings. Apart from that, in any written communication we Indians generally tend to be more formal.

I think you should mean serial no of the machine. We need to identify the system at the security post. I think they don't have mechanism for detecting MAC.

system that will be used for kids and people with visual disabilities. It
would basically require the integration of a sound playback software, on the

My apologies for the latency in responding. We have a pretty active LUG here
at IITM thanks to the efforts of about a dozen or so people. We have
student-developers in the Gnome, KDE and OpenEmbedded communities, some of
them being Google Summer of Code students. We also have had
debian-developers amongst us, who are now alumni and grad students in the
US. The Hackfest or FOSS conference event as it was earlier called was
introduced in our technical festival in 2008, and was extremely successful
in the 2008 and 2009. Through the talks, BoFs, workouts and hack-nights held
during the event, we were successful in motivating students to contribute in
the long-term to projects like Sugar, ffmpeg and Gnome. Some of them went to
do a GSoC the year after they attended Hackfest.
This year we took an initiative to ensure that hacking culture passes on to
the newer generations at IITM - a mini-summer of code where seniors guided a
bunch of juniors in writing open source applications which could be useful
to Linux newbies. We call it the "Shaastra Distro" as we plan to package
these applications on top of Ubuntu, though they will be available
stand-alone as well.
We have not been regular in holding LUG sessions (we have about 4-5 per
semester, a number which needs improvement), but we hope to rectify that
soon.

Kirtika

ilugc holds it's monthly meetings at IIT every second saturday - do you
people attend. As far as I remember, in the days Kumar Appaiah, we used
to see some IIT students, but not recently (although I have not attended
the last meets)

I really don't know what the reason for this is. I have tried to bring
several friends of mine to the meet, but, for some reason, the focus
and interests of several people in IITM at the time seemed to be on
just using Linux as a substitute for Windows, and little more. Another
set seemed to fear that they didn't know enough to be able to
participate in the LUG meets; I was also in this category, till I
understood that the LUG wasn't for geek discussions (alone), but
ordinary users of varying levels trying to exchange knowledge and
ideas.

It would be nice if the "balkanization" was less, since, I am
absolutely certain that everyone would benefit from exchanges at the
LUG.

I went into a shop to buy a USB flash drive. The guy had various kinds
sony, mosser bauer etc. Asked him to recommend. He said Sony - I looked

system requirements: windows/MAC/Linux, and under linux: kernel 2.4.2 or

So, I don't know if you are being sarcastic, but I wasn't born with a
silver Linux CD in my hands. Even today, I sometimes fear asking
questions on some mailing lists, thinking they may be too stupid. :-)

While English does not have a respectful version of you/go etc, it is
normal to see a "Please" added before actions or address. Software
(and the folks behind it) tend to convey messages and prompts in a
respectful manner. Same goes for "directions to use" or other such
messages on product packaging and boards in public areas.

It would make sense to use language in a way that it does not raise
heckles, IMHO.

Feel free to ask your questions/doubts ( even it may be too stupid )  in lug
mailing list.

Here no one scolds you for questions/doubts. Dont fear.

Just we need to follow some simple discipline like

* put proper subject
* reply in inter post
* no top/bottom post
* write your queries in simple english [ not in sms words]

Thats all. The above guidelines are not at all rules.

It makes readability to all. :-)

we have to follow this in our personal mails also. so we no need to take
separate care  to ask your questions/doubts in mailing list.

We invite you to come and attend the ILUGC meet in IITM. More over ILUGC
meeting location is too near to you.

Most of the ilugc people have been coming to IITM by spending more than 3
hours traveling time to attend lug meet.

ILUGC planned to will give a talk for newbie to linux in every meet. So you
can come there and attend.

Also you can come up with any talk ( whatever you want to share ) and will
present there.

We welcome you people to attend the ilugc meet and to ask your questions
about linux in ilugc mailing list.

Bring your friends too :-)

Thanks & Regards,

Boss, you have made the point that manufacturers should take notice of the Linux. However I have used some cheap Taiwanese and Chinese (innominate) pen drives also on my debian 4.0 without trouble. Only problem being I had to switch to root to unmount them.

You are being very modest. AFAIK no Debian developer is attending ILUGC
meets.
As an aside, in the beginning I began using Linux just because it was the
easily available
Unix clone and did not know anything about contributing to it. I was
inspired by you and
got drawn towards Debian and FOSS.

Apart from two or three, there are not even package maintainers in ILUGC
meets.
And there are quite a few FOSS contributors in IITMLUG. It would be nice to
have
people from IITM LUG attend ILUGC meets. It will definitely help improve
ILUGC
meets a lot. And IITM people also can occasionally get to know things. :-)

Samsung Laser printers works fine with most linux distro with their
unified driver.
I have ML-1666 ( 1600 Series) which works fine with Linux/Mac/Win.

I think you should use unzip command. I am not sure whether it comes
with fedora by default. If not you should install it using yum.

Thanks and Regards

zip is not windows specific. zip files work well on Linux well. I have
tested it and works under rhel 4, 5 , sles 9, 10.

Dear Guyz,

I live in chennai and i would like to hear your feedback with regard to the
service of MTS-Blaze.Some feedbacks on the net on MTS-Blaze is not that
good.
I would like to buy this for two reason

1) It has a prepaid plan i.e-Rs.999 for unlimited
2) It has a minimum plan of 198 rupees for 250 MB- this i can use it in my
lean roaming month.

However, I would like to take your feedback with regard to speed.
I also hear that on an unlimited plan after 30 Gb for 30 Days, one document
in the net says that the service automatically changes to CDMA 1.x speed?, i
am not clear with this, can some one through some light on it.

Dude,
What are you trying to do?

If you are trying to educate people on the list you could simply point to a
better written documentation like

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/select.html

or write a simple to understand step by step explanation instead of
dumping incoherent
sentences.

Your efforts will be much admired(I hope).

Dear all,

United Institute of Technology (www.uit.ac.in), started in 2009, affiliated
to Anna University, Coimbatore has been completely using F/OSS
for their internal infrastructure

Asterisk / Trixbox for Voice communication
Zimbra for E-mail / Collaborative messaging
Moodle for Learning Management System (
http://ekluvya.uit.ac.in/moodle/login/index.php)
OpenLDAP for authentication

Apart from the above, LinuXpert Systems have setup a 90 seat FOSS lab for
the department of CSE using Fedora-13 (4500+ packages) and they are
about to do all their practicals in GNU/Linux platform.

Ahh thats really bad .  That too since it is coming from a college
which has a FOSS club .
Yeah students as your senior has suggested kindly go for newer topics .

 I have a very bad gut feeling that you are repeating the same because
you are very comfortable with that particular technology and don't
want to try anything new . It's ok for an year but year by year if
same topics come .. I am sad to say that it reflects many 'things'  .

I am not telling this as an advice . All I am saying is in the pure
spirit of FOSS we love trying out things and our world keeps on
changing . Finally I suggest you to use some bleeding edge distro :D

Pavithran

Thanks, do you think all our work/efforts are getting paid.

All the FOSS labs we have setup so far is completely done at free of cost.
The institutions pay only for
our expenses and we don't see any commercials in them.

If it is a commercial activity, I won't be posting them in this list.  We
setup FOSS labs to promote FOSS in education and not to promote our
business.

Transcend seems to have good Linux support. The System requirement

Hi,
In the past few days i had a complaint from many of the juniors:
After ubuntu installation, everything works fine until you boot into

I have faced issues with Dell's Data Safe Software fiddling with the
MBR everytime we boot into Windows and causing troubles with GRUB. The
solution was to disable/uninstall that software and the issues were
gone.

hi,

thanks to all who answered my questions, I bought a HP deskjet F4488. It
scans, copies and prints both colour and black. I plugged it in, went to
kwrite, clicked on 'print' - it recognised it as Hp 4400 series and
printed without a murmur. Then I clicked on scan - it scanned. No need
to install or configure anything. Copier of course does not need the
computer. The print is a bit hazy - I think I went about aligning the
cartridges wrong. Distro fedora 12. The printer costs 4K in Ooty.

Hi,
  Please quote properly. I could not find which is your reply and which is
quoted one.
And do not add unnecessary tags in subject line. It breaks organisation.

Nice to hear this. You are doing great help to students and Free Software
community.
I have seen first year students learning wrong ways of writing C programs
with archaic
Turbo-C compiler that doesn't know what standard C is. This happens in Anna
university too.

Are you running the server and client in a same machine?

Try in different machines.

Put server as where the ejabberd is running.
check from client that it pingable and nmap shows the jabber port.

update here with the results.

Message-ID: <AANLkTim1BK9hu_s1nmuL2ArfpT8P2naHMAqnCEcaOqX0@mail.gmail.com>

Friends.

My friend, a php developer is working inside a proxy environment.

He is customizing an existing php application.
It uses a lot of fopen functions to get content from some external websites.

Because, his apache is inside a proxy, it can not fetch the contents.
He is tired of rewriting the entire code from fopen to use cURL.

Is there any way to tell the apache server to use the proxy server's auth
credentials when it fetch the data from external sites?

Thanks.

Hi,

>>All the FOSS labs we have setup so far is completely done at free of cost.
The institutions pay only for
our expenses and we don't see any commercials in them.

>>If it is a commercial activity, I won't be posting them in this list.  We
setup FOSS labs to promote FOSS in education and not to promote our
business.

There is nothing wrong in doing a commercial activity and reporting to
ilugc, I see the same model and opportunity can be replicated to all members
in the ilugc who are willing to do this as work/service,  I would request
you to give the list of college where you have done your foss service in
promoting foss for education along with college name,hod name , mobile
phone  and that the same can be placed in our wiki page.

Since I am still in the college, some more info

just a few minutes back there was a discussion with HOD / Staff members /
sys. admin about the complete migration
to FOSS in other depts. (ECE/EEE) as they have experimented with Fedora
Electronics Lab and requested for
another 120 machines (as nobody is interested in going with windows and
decided to drop out completely).

This was one of the best FOSS implementation in an engineering college I
have ever done in the recent years (anybody in/around Coimbatore region,
interested in knowing about the implementation, can come directly and can
get feedback about the implementation)

College: United Institute of Technology, Coimbatore (Very nearby Anna
University, Coimbatore)
HOD/CSE Mr. Nageswara Gupta (98432-55706) requested for an awareness program
for the students of CSE in the afternoon.

AFAIK, mbr has been pointed to GRUB after Ubuntu  installation and it works
fine until u boot into windows. I dont understand what you mean by
recognising the ubuntu partition.

Thats good of your comments which i have seen above. But, the students from
schools and other colleges are always the learners.. Its not the matter of
'newer topics' where the people get changed every time and the students in
different stalls take up new stalls every new year. More over, every year
new students from second year, third year and final year opt for demo
stalls. They wish to learn new topics which are famous in the current
scenario.

Thats good of your comments, but foss is stilll developing :(((( Within few
years, more new technologies will be used  :))

Will provide the details once I return chennai.

We are about to setup 50+ FOSS labs for engineering colleges affiliated to
Anna University, Coimbatore in the next 1 year.  I am also requesting
college sys. admins to join our ILUG-C mailing list to know about our
activities.

http://aufossa.org:8080/aufossa/search/home.action

We are also planning to promote FOSS among the  engg./arts colleges
through Anna
University Coimbatore
Free and Open Source Software Association.

Very nice to know. Its surprising to hear that a college has such an
interest in FOSS to the extent of migrating entire infrastructure to
GNU/Linux platform.
Hats off to your great work :-) It seems within a few years all the
educational institutions in TamilNadu will be using GNU/Linux, thanks to
LinuXpert Systems :-):-)

Hi all,
    I need to configure the both ejabberd and psi on the same machine
I tried executing nc -v localhost 5280 and got this message.
goten@MetalBig:~/ejabberd-2.1.5/conf$ nc -v localhost 5280
nc: connect to localhost port 5280 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
Connection to localhost 5280 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

goten@MetalBig:~/ejabberd-2.1.5/bin$ ./ejabberdctl status
The node ejabberd@MetalBig is started with status: started
ejabberd 2.1.5 is running in that node

Fine.

It says that ejabberd is started.
But can not connect.

Give the output of "nmap localhost"

Turn off iptables.

Hi,

I use MBLAZE. The 999 Plan is what I use. The first 15GB data can be
downloaded at 3.1Mbps. The rest at 144Kbps (not sure though). The device
has the necessary installers for Windows and Linux inside it. But they
won't install well.. I had a lot of trouble after trying to install the
debs bundled with the device. So I installed usb-modeswitch packages and
the network manager (Ubuntu) recognized the device. The configuration
settings, password et. al. are in the manual.

I also use wvdial. Download speeds for torrents are awesome. But web
pages load a bit slower ( could also be because I use FF 4 beta and
Chromium ). The connection itself is a bit flaky sometimes, i.e. goes
dead all of a sudden. Yes. The service switches to CDMA 1.x speed after
the first 15GB (Not 30GB).

Yogesh.

Subject: [Ilugc] Perl script for Hacking :-)
Message-ID: <AANLkTinOcT+9+f_kmacSe66JMUecA=zY6ze=KYzxzz8C@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

My Joomla site had got hacked today morning... [atleast a dozen sites under
my host also got hacked]

I inquired with my webhost, he sent a Perl script that he said was probably
used for hacking.

I have no idea about Perl, perhaps any of you guys can do an analysis and
tell how exactly that script is working and achieving the result.

At least, people can be more careful in the future :-)

The Code is below:

#!/usr/bin/perl -I/usr/local/bandmin
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print'<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "

Friends.

I have a hard disk almost dead.
It is recognized in bios some times.

When booted with that harddisk with a ubuntu live cd,
sudo fdisk -l

is showing nothing.

The disk is not recognized by ubuntu.
It is not showing any disk or partitions.

But still, can hear the sound "tak tak tak" sound from the hard disk.

Is it any possibilities to get data from that hard disk?

s/hacked/cracked/

It is true that the media has been misusing the term 'hacking' for
many years. It doesn't mean we should too. Hackers are programmers who
are passionate about programming, and who take solving problems to the
highest level. Whom you are referring to are called 'crackers'.

You are in a Free/Open Source Software mailing list. Let the true
meaning and spirit remain atleast on such mailing lists. Some

testdisk should always be tried out. It might not be present on the
Live CD, but you should be able to apt-get it with sufficient
RAM/swap.

HTH.

Does it show up in BIOS? If it doesn't get that far then testdisk won't
help.

Yes. It is shown in BIOS.
But not recognized in OS.
The sound itself shows that it is not in good condition.
But need the data.

Let the disk sit idle for a couple of days and then power it up.   I
have had some limited luck with the trick.

You can also try "hard disk in freezer" trick (google search on the keywords)

testdrive is in the "System Rescue Cd"  Live CD. <www.sysresccd.org>

Good luck and let us know how it works out for you.

Few folks came to us with a very similar case.

But we are OpenBSD guys. ;)

And our filesystem is so superior. And we don't have crap like GRUB. Still...

Anyway finally we heard that the data was recovered using a cracked
Chinese Windows GUI Tool.

We would like to specialize in this data recovery business but we are
lost how to begin.

Disk making 'tak tak tak' noise?

IMO, the OP's problem is hardware related.   Can OpenBSD resurrect
dead hard disks?

Please start a different thread if you want to discuss merits/demerits
of FS and boot loaders.

IMO, OP's problem is not a file system issue and knowing him
personally I am confident he would have sorted out the problem on his
own.

Please, either name the tool or avoid such statements.  Unauthorized
use of a nameless tool IMO  does not solve OP's problem.

You can try smartmontools (http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/) if SMART
was enabled in hard disk.

If it is a case of hardware failure best way is not to use the disk (because
it may cause more damage.) and send it for hardware recovery. This is
expensive though. Decide if data is worth it.

from googling :

( 'tak tak tak' qualifies as serious noise i guess)

I have also heard about similar bandwidth reduce from a broadband
vendor here in Bangalore. So i feel strongly that, this true. And also
this is true across all data-card broadband vendors. It is always
better to go for fixed line Broadband than data-card broadband if you
can.

Yes. Google gives some links that says freezer saves the hard disk some times.
Kept that hard disk in freezer for 24 hrs :-)

But no use.

Hi All,

Free Software Foundation, Tamil Nadu, as part of its agenda to take Free
Software to the people, is taking up the ambitious task of creating a distro
aimed primarily at school going children in the rural areas of Tamil Nadu.
The project aims at taking the Sugar interface and customising it to suit
the local needs. This involves developing Tamil applications and translating
the applications which are already present.

We invite all those who are interested in taking the movement to the people
to come forward and join hands with us in this grand endeavor. It is going
to be an exciting challenge where we use technology to solve social
problems.

As the old saying goes, "Technology meets Society" and we being at the
forefront of technology have the unique opportunity to serve the society.

We aim to complete the project by Oct 15th, and hence, a team has to be
formed by September 15th. Please mail us at (punnagai@fsftn.org) telling us
why you are interested in the project. Do not worry about your technical
skills, we have a dedicated team of experts who can help and train you in
developing your skills. All we require is enthusiasm and intent.

Once we come up with the distro, FSF-TN aims to conduct workshops to train
the school teachers (Teach the Teachers) and enable them to work on the
GNU/Linux platform. We are in for some exciting days ahead!! Hope to see you
all in action.

For FSFTN

It would be nice if you could tell us the cost of such service in Chennai.

I hope they are able to recover your data.

Moving forward I suggest that you use RAID1 for your important files.

In the last few weeks, in the various ILUG mailing lists, there has
been discussion on "School OS" [1]  (Ubuntu based) which I believe has
been developed under the aegis of NCERT (I hope I got that right).
Rather than create yet another distro - it might be worthwhile
concentrating efforts on improving and extending what is already
there.

If there is strong need for a new distro then please address the following:

1. Support/ Training issues
2. Software updates
3. Release cycle to keep up with whichever upstream distro it is based of.

When bios detects your hard disk, after booting from live cd / sysresccd,
run dmesg
and check for the kernel messages to get info about the hard disk (grep for
instances of sda or similar)
and this might give you some clear idea about any physical problems in the
disk.

AFAIK, School OS does not include sugar desktop and activities. The OP is
looking at creating a distro based on sugar to meet the local people's need.

If you are unable to detect the harddisk in BIOS or if it is detected only
sporadically, the problem is most likely with the PCB and not your
harddisk media. That is good news because if the media is ok, then you can
save the harddisk contents.

Try the following:
1. Try accessing the harddisk from another computer. The problem could be
with your SATA/IDE cable or the SATA/IDE chipset on your motherboard.

2. If you are unable to detect the hard disk even from another computer,
then you will need to take it to one of the harddisk recovery chaps who
may be able to swap out your PCB on your harddisk for a working PCB and
you may be able to recover the data.

Prem

If the print is hazy, try adjusting the side bar on the paper load tray, so that it fits to the size of the paper.
The only downside is that printing in Linux consumes more ink. You could deduce this from the wet paper that comes out. 
Also it is recommended that you buy a new catridge. The one that came with your printer is just an introductory catridge and would last for only 60 pages. A new catridge costs around Rs.350 (original HP as well as compatible types). I would suggest buying a compatible catridge over original. A refill would give you a print of approx 200 pages.
Also learn to refill the catridge, this would be handy. Refilling a catridge in Chennai costs Rs.50 at a minimum and Rs.100 at a max. "How to refill" videos available in youtube!!?

I thought one had to align using the alignment option - this is not
available in linux - only in mac and windows. Actually I did not know
about alignment. (it prints an alignment paper which has to be scanned
in). I used thin paper for this and the paper got wrinkled which is why
I think it is not aligned properly. I tried to remove the cartridges and
reinsert them, but the alignment function did not work. I suppose I will
have to live with it until I buy a new cartridge or go to a windows
machine to do this?

my paper is quite dry when it comes out.

By "taking", do you mean mounting an existing Windows partition,
creating a new (FAT/NTFS) partition, or backing it up?

Thanks.

Absolutely, i agree  but let me repeat "Its not just about trying a new
thing, a demo stall is for imparting knowledge for the FOSS world freshers,
who would be more interested in the general technology instead of
a professional or specific technology."

Those who are in the level of experimenting technologies don't need demo
stalls, they look out for it, them self.[This is what i experience and
believe]

Lets just hope this SFD be successful!

Sugar interface is fine but it is essentially a Window Manager [1] and
IIRC it is available for Fedora.

Why can it not be ported/extended to the SchoolOS distro which is
based on Ubuntu?  There is already some effort on the way [2].

What I am suggesting is look for convergence between the various
efforts and effective use of resources (limited).

I guess I belong to the previous generation though I am not very old.

But today's kids get a chance to learn programming and computers quite early on.

In my case I first saw a computer in my 11th class in the Kavaratti
island, the capital of Lakshadweep in
 Arabian sea.

I was once told by my lecturer Mr. Hameed Koya that software could
turn one into a millionaire overnight.

Then I started my career back in '98 and I was working during the dot
com boom and when everyone was going
in search of greener pastures.

I thought making millions was easy by technology and innovation.

But innovating is not easy (in fact it is not even possible) without
programming.

And this is a sad fact that nobody seems to understand.

Programming is everything. Today if they teach C programming in school
then surely we are going in the
right direction.

Does that mean that I would not have to teach people programming? This
does not seem to be the case.

Not that I am very good at it myself but at least I realize the value.

In short creating millions and building a true career for oneself is
not possible without sheer programming effort coupled with
technological innovation at the big picture level.

First: please "reply" to the e-mails; if not, a separate thread is
created and it is difficult for people to search for the questions and
answers in a group.

Next, you can just search for the right things on the web to get your
answers. For example, a search for "mounting windows partitions
centos" led me to this page:

http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/centos_linux_guides/centos_linux_step_by_step_guide/s1-q-and-a-windows.html

I don't know if the hardware driver exists on your installation of
CentOS, but if you know the partition which contains Windows, the
remaining steps in that page should be straightforward.

Should you have any troubles, reply to this mail on the list.

Has anyone here had a chance to try MariaDB ? I would like to hear some pros
and cons. I have been investigating on this for a while.

I heard that Open source projects has started supporting MariaDB as an
alternate for MySQL. In fact Drupal QA setups were already using it for a
while [1], however i have not seen any good installation/ migration
documentation neither support from hosting providers side. Any thoughts
pertaining to this will be greatly appreciated.

Can this be added to Demo stalls to spread awareness  ?

user mounted partitions typically go under
/mnt/<some_dir_for_mount_point>.  You can put them in /etc/fstab
provided that these partitions will be available at boot time.   You
can allow users to mount/unmount such partitions by putting "users" in
the options field,  to by pass boot time fsck  put "0  0" at the end
for such mount points.  (further reading man/info mount)

Auto mounted devices like USB pendrives external hard disks are
mounted under /media/<label_name>

None, the tools are the same system or user mounts

AFAIK, Linux is a kernel. What is the distribution? what are you trying to
do with the phone? Trying to connect to the internet or trying to access the
files in your phone? Tell us about the scripts you tried. How is the  phone
connected to the computer? Bluetooth or with the cable? Why don't you try
distribution provided network manager or bluetooth applet?

If you don't give us answer for the above questions we won't have a clue.

yes - I tried three distros - opensuse, fedora and mandriva (all of them
use the linux kernel as far as I know)

trying to access files - when connecting a nokia, one gets some options
like camera, mass storage etc on the phone. Choosing mass storage does
the trick. Here there is no such menu on the phone (s5600)

I tried samsutools and comsams. Samsutools crashes and make does not
work in comsams

I tried fedora's network manager, but it gave an unhandled exception and
crashed

It is very hard to answer your question. I will try to give overview of all
about NoSQL.

MySQL is a relational database management system, written to run on single
machine and it provides ACID property (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and
Durability), whereas NoSQL (Stands for Not Only SQL) is an emerging
distributed and scalible non-relational data storage mechanism for storing
large scale of data.
NoSQL is not alternative to mysql database. *NoSQL is about choice*. You
have to evaluate which NoSQL database most suited for your problem. It is
very hard to tell which NoSQL database to solve your problem.

LIST OF NOSQL DATABASES: http://nosql-database.org/

If you see the above page there is lot of NoSQL databases are there.
Choosing among the one for your problem is little bit hard at begining, it
dependends on business you are running. Last month I gave a presentation
about "EVALUATING NOSQL DATABASES" for our engineers. I would like to share
some of the thing to you:

There are two things you have to consider at evaluating NoSQL databases for
your problem.
I). The Data Model.
II). The CAP Theorem.

I). The Data Model :
NOSQL databases can be categorized according to their "Data Model"(is all
about the system internally stores the data) into the following four
categories:

   1. Key-Value-stores
   2. BigTable-implementations
   3. Document-stores
   4. Graph Databases

Example :
1). Key-Value
- Voldemort
- Dynomite

2). Column-Oriented
Hadoop HBase
Cassandra
Hypertable

3). Document-Oriented
CouchDB
MongoDB

You have to find out which data model is sutable for your bussiness data(eg.
last month sorceforge.net started to using MongoDB it comes under the
document-stores data model categorie:
http://www.infoq.com/presentations/MongoDB-at-SourceForge).

II). The CAP Theorem :

Eric Brewer is an expert in distributed system and professor at UC Berkeley
formulated a theorem called CAP theorem. CAP stands for Consistency,
Availability, and Partition tolerance. These are three properties that are
commonly desired in a distributed system. The theorem simply states that any
shared-data system can only achieve two of these three.

So the CAP theorem allows the designer of distributed system can only pick
two of the those three properties.

At the time of evaluating NoSQL for your bussiness, you have to make sure
which of three property are important for your business model.

1). Consistent, Available (CA) Systems have trouble with partitions:
Example:
- Traditional RDBMSs like Postgres, MySQL, etc (relational)
- This system sacrifice Partition-Tolerant

2). Consistent, Partition-Tolerant (CP) Systems have trouble with
availability while keeping data consistent across partitioned nodes.
Example:
- Hypertable, HBase
- This system sacrifice Available
3).  Available, Partition-Tolerant (AP) Systems:
    Example :
- Cassandra, CouchDB

You can find the Mathematical proof of CAP theorem and explanation here:
http://nosqlsummer.org/paper/cap-theorem
http://www.julianbrowne.com/article/viewer/brewers-cap-theorem

The CONCLUSION is :
Last 30 to 40 years,  we have only one option traditional
RDBMSs(SQL,Postgres, MySQL...) for all of our problem. Now the trend has
been changing(The era of using RDBMSes for *all problems* is over), *instead
we should use the database most suited for the problem at hand*. NoSQL is
about choice. We could even use multiple databases in conjunction, and let
each database handle the things it do best.

I think there is a stall in SFD-2010 about NoSQL. I request you come there
you may get more clear ideas about NoSQL.

I hope it will help you and others also.

Innodb storage backend has provided it for years now.  It is even the
default in the latest release.

That was a nice write up ! For someone who just been curious about NoSQL but 
never had a reason or motivation to look it up, your post summed it up quite 
nicely, Thanks !

Hi all,
    We are  developing a social networking website.We  googled and found
that facebook & twitter is using cassandra,google is using bigtable and
hypertable is used by baidu&rediff.And we do not have hands on experience on
designing a database or choosing a database because this is our first
project.But if it is a language(PHP)  or Technology(Cloud Computing) we have
some knowledge.But in case of Database we are fresh to that area.We do not
know how to design or manage a huge scalable high performance database.

Note:  I heard MariaDB is gaining popularity now and Explanation provided by
Mohan L was very nice.It makes us to clearly focus on choosing database
based on problem.

It is not entirely impossible but it is  going to be a colossal effort.

Perhaps you can start with a manual approach first. Then over a long
period say six months
you can find a pattern/graph of the commonly asked questions.

You can then form canned answers and come up with an automaton.

Yes yes. It was my first ever product. But it never saw the light of the day.

I did that on Gentoo Linux with Xephyr(Xnest) and the event subsystem.

It worked well but then I dropped the idea in no time.

It sure has potential though but you will have to find out from a
marketing angle how willing people are towards this.

Perhaps you could integrate this idea with a thin client or LTSP and
then make sense.

I'm using Samsung M3510 which has an option to change the mode of connection
at Settings->PC Connections. I hope all the phones will have some option or
the other to change the mode. If the mode of connection is set to "Mass
storage" the filesystem of the mobile and memory cards, if any will be
mounted automatically. You can set the mode to "Ask on connection" if you
want to connect the mobile phone to system for various purposes.

(Sorry to talk about a mobile phone in a LUG mailing list. Anyway it might
help the OP to access the files in a mobile phone from GNU/Linux).

Omg! Yet another social networking?! Can you tell me what is the purpose of
your social networking? Nowadays developing a social networking site has
become like starting engineering colleges in Tamilnadu :-( I don't
understand if there is any use to the community.
As most of the people here know (I guess so), Free Software world is no more
lacking a social networking software. GNU Social[1] is one such developed
under GNU by FSF, using PHP5. Diaspora [2] is another such thing using Ruby.
Both of these allow private hosting which implies very high security (Please
correct me if I'm wrong).
Rather than reinventing the wheel you can contribute to any of these Free
Software, IMHO.

Hi, I have been searching for any kind of open source graphics software
which will do some job like:

1. Flashing inserted data all over the web page. As for example: I inserted
some datas from Share Market Web Sites, some random data... those data will
produce some "dancing bubble" figure all over the window. Or, say those data
collaboratively produce one "human figure" or just "tickers" from bottom of
the webpage to top of the page.

2. I am not talking about Flash! I need some game engine which will play
such thing. As for example: in any game scores blinks or bumps or changes
with various colors after increment or decrement! I want something.

Is it possible with any kind of open source game engine? Or, What do you
suggest me to use?

I am not a perl expert. However this is my finding. The below part could
be the culprit.

<snip>
    @lines =<$FORM{pass}>;
    $y = @lines;
    open (MYFILE, ">tar.tmp");
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
    if($FORM{tar} ne ""){
        open(INFO, "tar.tmp");
        @lines =<INFO> ;
        close(INFO);
        system(@lines);
        print'<p><a href="'.$FORM{tar}.'.tar">Click here 2 download tar
        file</a></p>';
    }
</snip>

Basically the cracker can send some system commands in the form token
'pass'(something like "newpasswd\n sudo change_root_passwd "). This is
written into a file without validation, later the lines in the file gets
executed using system command. So the cracker would be able to run
system commands which will allow him to get into your system.

In the terminal type *emacs* and hit enter. When the editor has loaded, hold
shift and hit the escape key. Then type *xdoctor* and hit return. Answer the
first question and proceed from there. When you're done, control-X control-C
will quit the editor.

This make interaction between user and system (xdoctor). If you type
something, it (psychotherapist) will return some answer depends upon your
question.

This may help you to understand the automated chat.

IIRC, the default name for the volumes (both phone memory and memory card)

If your users have access to IRC, you may use IRC bots. The knowledge
can be stored within the bot and it can be accessed later as
references. It can be configured to be interactive. You do not need
any special privileges to setup bot. It can be operated as yet another
IRC client.

Many open source projects use these kind of bots to store keyfacts
about the projects. For instance, at Subversion we use a bot called
wayita. It can be used to store references to various svn
commands/urls. As an example, it can be used to pass on message to a
user who is not logged in at the moment. When the user does login,
he'll be informed about this message.

Example:
01:54 <@ehu> wayita: tell julianf to send me his "NODE_DATA" field
categorization
01:54 < wayita> ehu: will do.
.
.
02:12 -!- julianf [~Bert@2001:610:66e::222] has joined #svn-dev
02:12 < wayita> julianf: ehu said: to send me his "NODE_DATA" field
categorization

More details about these sort of bots can be found here:
  http://producingoss.com/en/irc.html

Sounds like, supybot is best among various choices.

But Why?  "Creating" is half the fun of knowing to hack and especially if
it's a hobby/passion. I get great satisfaction in creating my own apps. I
have seen a few mails asking people to rather contribute than create. Is
this an Indian mindset? What "if" the OP creates a better social networking
platform than Facebook? I would love to see someone from this list becoming
a millionaire in that process and enjoying it all the way...

In a literal way, if the inventor of magnetic levitation (linear motors) did
not want to reinvent the wheel, what  would have happened? That means of
transport does not require wheels... :)

Hmmm! What's this obsession with Indian thing, anyway? It makes sense when
something is
proprietary and even supporting it would mean paying money to a foreign
company paying
taxes to some other country. Isn't Free Software supposed to solve this
problem? By allowing
local engineers to support and customize the product and also give back any
improvements,
which sometimes may even be truly revolutionary?

At this, you can always claim that an Indian contributed that great idea to
that project. :-)

Thank you very much.............

There are lot of software products in the world but there are only fews
Indians products that are in market.We are the second in world IT.But we
only provide support and services to product developed americans.Listen to
chinese now they are dominating in softwares fields too most of the cloud
computing research paper are published by Chinese only.But in case of India
cloud computing will take to reach india after 4 or 5 years only.Chinese are
so fast and they are also in dominating software products.As they develope
fake hardwares they are also develope some fake softwares.


Note:
Infosys,CTS,TCS are only providing support and services to the american
products.Eventhough they have money they do not have guts to come against
Americans[Microsoft - if microsoft everyone who uses their product to falls
- only they want to dominate the world].We are proud to work on those
company but not developing our own standards and products.

The intention is not to stop creating new software. If the OP's basic idea
of the new software is completely novel then creating a new software is
worth it. But if one says "I'm going to create a software exactly like
facebook", then what is the use when an equivalent Free Software exists? If
the OP's new software is intended to have extended features, then adding
those features to the existing software makes it more usable.

Studying the existing software and modifying it is more of hacking than what
creating is. A good programmer should be able to study and analyze others
programs as well.

What you are talking is totally with the mindset of proprietary software. In
Free software world, there is no concept of a single owner of a software.
The term "Indian product" thus becomes meaningless. Everyone across the
globe is free to contribute to a Free software. Even if a particular
software has all its developers in India it shouldn't be called an Indian
software.

Patriotism doesn't mean creating software exclusively for one's own country.
Pls understand the basic ideology of Free Software clearly.

To be fair to the OP, he never mentioned that they wanted to make an exact
copy of Facebook. All he wanted was info on a key-value/NoSQL database. I
still don't understand your stance. Are you saying that there should not be
multiple Distributions of open source Linux distros / Browsers / Database
servers / Chat engines /  Gaming frameworks / ... / ... and everyone
involved with open source should contribute to one root distro / browser /
db server etc? In my opinion, unless there are choices to the end user and
unless open source teams compete with each other, there will be very little
innovation / creativity or even bug fixes. Let there be plurality. It is a
must for a good open source eco system. And I think it is plainly wrong to
judge a person's capacity to create and innovate.

I am not against contribution to other projects. I salute all
the contributors to the open source projects out there. Without them, the
open source eco system will not be where it is.

I think it is a very personal opinion and cannot be debated. For one, I am
not good at studying and analyzing other people's code, but I would let my
peers decide weather I am a good programmer or not ;)

> Patriotism doesn't mean creating software exclusively for one's own
country.
> Pls understand the basic ideology of Free Software clearly.

I am not against open source and free software.
I am not money minded like proprietary software owners.
We love open source. so you are advising or suggesting me the "the basic
ideology of Free Software clearly".

But i am creating project using crowd sourcing [ It is advanced than social
networking and  this feature is not available in facebook or any social
media i believe ] concept which is now emerging.

since it deals with crowd [ a large number of Internet users or a
community].We thought that there will be  huge number hits to our servers.so
we cannot use the traditional database like  oracle or mysql.so we have to
switch over to Most efficient databases,web servers,languages,scripts
etc,.That's why i posted "Best nosql database".

And i  believe that  "Brazil and India: The Next Generation of Open Source"
refer: http://www.opensource.org/node/528

So when  i develop software or website i will use open source software and
if needed we  will
 included some features or contributions to those softwares.

And i use the term social networking because most of them might not known
about crowdsourcing.I did not mention i am going to make another facebook
[facebook is only used as entertainment media mostly].
Apart from entertainment we can use social networking or crowdsourcing for
disaster management and many more.please refer below ted talks to know more
about crowdsourcing and its uses

refer: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ted-talks-social-media/

And i am not telling that only Indian product should dominate the world but
i think in the international perspective
India is second in the IT industry but we are just application developers or
users  but not inventors.We do not invented or contributed to a compiler or
any other system tools,languages etc,.I thought our contribution is less to
the world even thought there are more than 5 lakhs IT sector employee are
there.This trend is slowly changing nowadays,lots of inventions are made
india eg: Pranav Mistry[he make his innovation as open source] .But the
change is very low.

I welcome the open source philosophy and its cross culture interactions
,contributions.

Note:
          We have heard about GNU Social and waiting for diaspora code to
released.
          But now only we started the project.We initially concentrated on
ideas  and not on technology so even though we have heard about the GNU
Social we haven't tried it. Thank you for ilugc to making  us  to realize
the GNU Social.

                               "Future is open source.And the future is in
our hands"

Hi,
The firewall is blocking the webmin port.
check your firewall to accept the requests for the port 10000

Even if you uninstall guarddog, iptables may be running.
stop iptables and check now.

Update us with your results.

Have you uninstall-ed *all* the files of the package?

The firewall may have left residual scripts that are still active and
blocking incoming connections on your WAN  port; which is a good
default setting IMO.

nmap your WAN IP, from a ssh account outside of your network to list
your open ports.

With version 1.340 your host may be vulnerable
(http://www.webmin.com/security.html).
I am sure Ubuntu has a later version of webmin, if not then grab the
latest deb package (1.5.2 as of  13/sep/10)  from Webmin's home site.

Dear All,

A 2 day workshop on Foss languages is currently under way  at  VLB
Janakiyammal College of technology ,Kovai pudur,Coimbatore.
Yesterday I took a session on "Ruby as a programming language" and it was
initially planned for 8 hours, found ourselves to have session for 4 hrs.
The session was marred by some disturbance caused by fringe religious group
which raised some issues out of immersion of Ganesh idol in the lake near
utkadam.
The college management is supportive , and the students are really
interested in learning new subjects.
Today, K.Baskar is taking session on Perl and PHP. On behalf of foss
community , I thank the department head and the college management for
providing us the oppurtunity.

Thanks and regards,
Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Please trim your quotes with relevant portions rather than repeat the
entire proceedings; most of us have threaded email clients and can
follow the discussion via the previous messages in the thread.

Coming back to your problem couple of things:

What is the output from "iptables --list" *before* and *after*
"iptables --flush?"  Can you ssh into your box after "iptables
--flush?"

Is this where you got your
<http://www.simonzone.com/software/guarddog/#download>?  It looks like
guarddog is a kde app.  I suspect it has left it's footprint somewhere
on your system and it is still tripping you.

1. boot into init level 3 (console i.e. no desktop) and verify if you
can connect to your ports.  (my suspicion it gets started when the
desktop comes up).
2. back up you ~/.kde into some tar file and then rm -fr ~/.kde
3. Restart your desktop;this will create a fresh .kde directory.
Verify if your problem persists.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=OiQopzEvCwQKDyLt6g74u+9g8BKpLfOEo9aZ=@mail.gmail.com>

Friends,

We need to integrate the context in tomcat with LDAP.
The examples available in net gives the server side solution.
Our requirement is

1. We need to integrate only one context with LDAP
2. Other contexts do not need LDAP. They will use the normal application
login.
3. The main problem is, client is using win 2003 server ADS.
4. Is it possible to do the integration with this?
5. Or any other solution?

Thanks

Does it really matter? Why should we not come up with another facebook
or orkut? Creating products with working features is a very different
ball game from selling those products or making it widely adopted.
Most LUG members are very good at creating these products, very few
(may be none) are good at selling them. How many of us have made
millions buy selling any such product?

I would personally welcome anyone who is trying to create new social
networks and learn the business aspect involved in selling those. Good
luck Rajkumar. We need more people like you!

Weizenbaum wrote Eliza (the original doctor) back in the 1960's as a parody
of what can/cannot be accomplished by computers and AI.  Eliza represents
the genesis of chatterbots which offer natural and human-like interaction with
a computer.

To the OP: Wikipedia has a good write up on Eliza, Weizenbaum and his
book http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA.  All of them are recommended
reading if you want to get deeper into NLP, AI, etc.

"Cloud" is a very broad catch all phrase.  You really need to be much
more specific on what you want to accomplish.

even if the basic idea is completely old and stale, it it is fun to do
it, if it scratches an itch, then creating new software is completely
worth it.

If the layout that is expected is provided or, details provided, an
additional keyboard layout could perhaps be created. There is indeed a
proliferation of typewriter keyboard(s) which is what I think is meant
by "there are many remington keyboard types".

hi,

I have been using poedit - but it is driving me crazy - apparently there
is no search and replace, not only that, where there is singular and
plural it messes up the original file and creates fatal errors. What do
you people recommend as a sane and efficient alternative?

Does lokalize do what you want? It seems to possess a search and
replace feature, though I have not used it yet.

HTH, and thanks.

You can also have a look at virtaal

develops Pootle also develop virtaal among other translation tools and

Lokalize is probably supplied by the kdesdk package (yum whatprovides
*/lokalize) . Personally I use virtaal when doing offline or,
pootle/transifex when doing online.

Message-ID: <759201.16997.qm@web33101.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

We have been using svn for a long time now but want to improve our usage in terms of config mgmt. and release mgmt.

Do any of you manage a production svn server for a product co? I want to explore usage of svn in different release/production scenarios.

Basically I want to explore "Best Practices" in using svn.

Thanks,
kc

If you come with your own issues on using svn, feel free to post here.
We can discuss on the things you have to follow.

Try installing Zimbra inside a chroot environment.  Zimbra forums have
posts/instructions on how to set this up.

I would not recommend this for production use, for testing it should be okay.

why are you cross posting?

basically svn has three things (atleast one should make three things) -
trunk, branches and tags.

trunk is where active development takes place.
branches are where developments that might bear fruit in the future but
are not of immediate relevance to trunk take place (it is of course a
good practice to constantly merge trunk into each of the active branches
so that they do not diverge too much)
tags are set and frozen for releases

Get into BIOS setup and check if the boot is set to HDD.

This is a problem occurring in most of the laptops with preinstalled
windows7. Already a thread had been created regarding this with subject
*Windows applications making GRUB 2 unbootable*.
Hope the following link helps you understand the problem.
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~cjwatson/blosxom/2010/08/28#2010-08-28-
windows-applications-making-grub2-unbootable<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/%7Ecjwatson/blosxom/2010/08/28#2010-08-28-windows-applications-making-grub2-unbootable>
But AFAIK, there is no existing solution to this.
The best alternative is to use Free software alone :) Become a complete
GNU/Linux user!
Else you can use some other distro or older versions of Ubuntu (9.04 or
earlier) along with windows.

Dell has a "Dell MBR" where it links Windows 7, Recovery drive (where your
original copy sits). When you install Ubuntu typically the GRUB2 overwrites
this MBR partition with GRUB2 pointing to Ubuntu and Windows7. There wont be
any problem as long as you keep booting into Ubuntu. But when you boot into
Windows7, it will allow you for once. When you reboot after the Windows7
boot, your MBR would have been overwritten by windows and now your ubuntu
becomes inaccessible. To solve this, use EasyBCD [1] to override the default
Win7 boot loader and while installing Ubuntu make sure not to install the
GRUB2 on MBR partition and instead install it somewhere else. EasyBCD will
load on boot, point to Windows7 and GRUB2 and this will be like any other
chained boot sequence, just that EasyBCD will be first instead of grub.

Now you should be having a dual boot without any issues. But the catch is
you cannot access your recovery partition (which is where your original
licensed copy of Win7 is present) since you no more have a Dell MBR. This
should be a problem only if you want to reinstall your Win7.Dell allows you
to order backup CDs which am told will be sent only once for a
laptop.Ideally you should have created the CD as soon as you booted your
laptop for the first time as suggested by the Dell Wizard. I just have
Windows7 for the servicing guys(if at all i face any hardware issues) and
hence havent bothered booting to it / order those backup CDs.

The only way to learn is to learn on your own.

I would like to thank FOSS club of Jaya engineering college for giving me
such a wonderful platform to speak on .

The SFD was more or like a Festival there .

The number of stalls truly amazed me and the enthusiasm showed by them
gives me a greater confidence that the days of proprietary softwares are
numbered .

The students in the stall elucidated what actual Free S/w means . Its not
just an intellectual alternative to proprietary softwares but a social
movement  which would spread its wings to all parts of TamilNadu in near
future .

The HOD sir has to be applauded for his greater interest . I thank him and
also congratulate him from bottom of my heart for spreading the message of
free S/W.

Each and every student had a participation in it .

The community model model is evolving .:)

Happily,
K.Sibi

The Software Freedom Day celebrations organised by ILUGC at Birla
Planetarium, Chennai was a great success with more than 550 people (after
regular crowd discounted) turning up to see the demo at 32 stalls by 87 Free
Software enthusiasts from in and around Chennai, including (in alpha order,
sorry if I missed out anyone.) AVIT FOSS Club, CEG Linux Users Group,
Computer Society of MIT, DS Linux Users Group, IITM Linux Users Group, Jaya
FOSS Club and Kanchi Linux Users Group.

The first prize went to CEG-LUG for a demo on a drawing tool for disabled
developed by themselves. Second and two Third prizes went to CS-MIT for GDB,
Quite Universal Circuit Simulator and Installation respectively. Congrats to
all of them. :-)

I don't know if this can be done, anyway, let we the ILUGC members,
congratulate ourselves for making this event a success. :-)

Friends.

Today, we had our ILUGC stall in OSI Days.
Printed the handouts and distributed to all visitors.

Most people wondered to know our activities and
appreciated our teams contributions.

Thanks for Raman, Shakthi kannan, Dhilip, Kumaresan, Sriram, Jeyanthan
and Sudharsan
for the handling the stall.

Here are some snaps.
http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=38413&id=133359730009404

For tomorrow and day after tomorrow's sessions,
we need volunteers to take care of the stall.

Please goto OSI days if you are free and be in the stall
to explain about our activities to the visitors.

Thanks.

Hi,

Whenever I echo something in PHP, the BOM gets appended automatically.

I am trying to print an output as XML. However, the resultant XML Is not
well formed, as the BOM gets appended before the resultant XML.

Parsers are not able to read the XML.

Is there any way to avoid or disable the BOM in PHP ?

   Dear All,
       As I configured proxy server with LDAP authentication. It was working
   fine. I want to restrict particular user not to access our proxy server.

   I googled and got the knowledge  about how to disable mac and ip-based
   restriction. Please let me know how to restrict based on the LDAP users.

   Ex:
       Users List:
       test1
       test2
       test3
       test4
       test5

       Out of  five users , I have to restrict test5 users must not access
   the proxy server at all. Please help me.

Sorry, was out of town, just saw this. Hmm, ejabbered turned out to be a 
pain to setup, and I went with JsJac+Openfire server (great plugins 
too). Theoretically it should be possible to integrate ejabberd and 
JsJac just fine. If you can post the specific problem you're having, 
maybe I can be of more help.

Could you please let us know why Duck Duck Go is a more sane
alternative to Google?

I presume you refer to the fact that they don't store cookies, IP
addresses and personal information. But database wise, they still
depend on Yahoo's BOSS.

Message-ID: <EBFF3D25A93447CAA9470C867019B970@gorav>

Dear Vellingiri,

You need to authenticate the users against a list or make a list of users who should not be allowed access. Add the following ACLs -

acl <group_name> proxy_auth -i "<path to the file containing list of usernames>"
eg. acl allowed_users proxy_auth -i "/etc/squid/users/allowed_users"

http_access allow <group_name>
eg. http_access allow allowed_users

If you want to deny only one user, you may modify the above rules to exclude that user.

Hope that helps.

actually my point is that ilugc should not recommend google (or
duckduckgo for that matter) The rule should be: use a search engine
before asking questions. I am not going to argue in favour of duckduckgo
- except to say that it gives me much better and accurate results than I
get from Google. And it looks free-er than google to me.

As KG suggested, you should avoid top-posting. Apart from that, I doubt 
if you're going to find any step-by-step tutorial to set this up. It's 
fairly simple if you read up the docs/search a bit:

http://trac.jwchat.org/jsjac/browser/README

http://whoahbot.com/2009/04/20/jabber-and-jsjac.html

Please setup your Apache config as suggested in the README (after 
setting up your ejabberd instance and making sure it's running) and make 
the required changes to the config (like changing the proxy url, etc), 
and try out examples/simpleclient.html. If that works, you've set it up 
correctly.

Vamsee.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinBXFodq+SmVwuH5nB6XkxOM8hfmpiAkpO4V19-@mail.gmail.com>

Dear people,

This mail is a reflection of my experience with ILUGC spanning more
than 6 years.

There are certain patterns I have observed and I want to communicate
something important.

This is for everyone's good. Please do not take it personally.

I am a plain speaker only for a sound reason. Sometimes we need to
swallow bitter pills, only
 then serious problems can be resolved.

The idea is this.

There is a Sanskrit word called "Bhava".

What does the word mean?

It means this:

"The humility/attitude towards something."

Without the right bhava there is no life.

Without the right bhava there is no learning.

It is just humility in a different garb.

Without the right openness/humility towards the right people/right
knowledge great things cannot be done.

We should always work hard with a feeling of devotion, piety and humility.

I find this utterly lacking in our country today.

You may be super intelligent but you are useless to the world, nay
even yourself if you do not have
 the right bhava.

I say this because recently I had a very painful experience working
very closely with someone who came from
LUG with all the characteristics I have known LUG to have.

Unfortunately this problem seems very characteristic of LUG since it
is not endemic.

I or for that matter anyone can condone conceit to a certain degree
but then without any accomplishment conceit
 will be scorned upon and rejected like poison.

Why? It hurts you more than it hurts others.

Then why feel great about oneself ?

No matter what one does one should always feel the right Bhava towards
knowledge. Otherwise learning will stop.

This mail is a prayer to help you cultivate this right attitude.

Life is attitude and nothing else.

If you have the right attitude anything is possible.

Without it no matter how capable you are  it is useless.

-Girish

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=5cQ=k3JheLSPU_sea_jqdYXP=EP3=vmZBzUNa@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

  I set up an apache 2.2 + SSL in my local Ubuntu Server 9.10 and hosted
Mantis. But whenever i am access mantis,my browser keep on loading and
saying that connecting 192.168.0.5 ( webserver's IP) , establishing secure
connection and it will take around 20 to 30 second to connect to Mantis.
Once i connected successfully then it will working fine and faster. And if
you are not doing any updation / reporting in mantis for 5 to 10 minute and
after that if you again go to mantis then again it will take 15 to 20 second
to establish the connection . First i thought that it may be database issue.
So in order to confirm that i just print the query and time taken for the
query on the respective pages. Surprise the database queries does not take
even 0.08s also.
So i think that problem might be with my apache 2.2.  Have you face these
kind of issues. I need your suggestion to fix this issue.


Ubuntu Server 9.10

Apache 2.2

PHP 5

My SQL 5

Mantis 1.0.6  ( Planning to upgrade)

Actually I could understand at least some of his feelings. So I'm sure at

Please send the httpd.conf and its included conf files to better
troubleshoot the problem. Normally httpd is not to blame , but your
network infrastructure might be mis-configured or choked. Send the
access log and error log also.

Hi .. your want and need are the same a server OS :)

I would suggest you download Debian stable .
http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/

The link also gives you an installation guide.  There are many ways to
install debian . If you are connected regularly I would suggest you to
download a minimal image but if you are new to GNU/Linux . you better
download CD 1 or DVD 1 and install a graphical desktop .
Images are available at http://www.debian.org/CD/


If you want a RH based server distribution , I would suggest you to
download CentOS which is free of cost download of RH enterprise linux
.
http://mirror.centos.org/centos/5/isos/

Both debian and centos are free of cost to download and are
recommended distributions for server . You can still try ubuntu server
but my opinion would be "better stick ubuntu to desktops "

Regards,
Pavithran

-------------- next part --------------
Solution
---------

This situation arises only when you don't remember root password or entering wrong password.

1. Stop MySql Server

As a first step, stop the mysql server using the following method:

# service mysql stop (or) # /etc/init.d/mysql stop

2. Please Add,  --skip-grant-tables to mysqld-safe startup command

open the mysql startup script and add skip-grant-tables as shown below.

# vi /etc/rc.d/init.d/mysql

OLD LINE:-
-----------
$bindir/mysqld_Safe --datadir=$datadir --pid-file=$server_pid_file $other_args >/dev/null 2>&1 &

NEW LINE:-
-----------
$bindir/mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables --datadir=$datadir -pid-file=$server_pid_file $other_args >/deve/null 2>&1 &

3.Start MySql Server with --skip-grant-tables

start the mysql server with skip-grant tables option which will allow anybody to login to mysql with out entering a password

#service mysql start
starting MySQL [ OK ]

4. Login using MySQL Root user without entering password

#mysql -u root mysql
(since one has skipped the grant table this time when one try to login to MySQL it will not ask for passwords)

5.To update mysql root password

<mysql> USER MySQL;
<mysql> UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD ('newpassword') WHERE user='root';
<mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

I think the command is "mysql -u root -p" and it should ask for password.

I haven't quoted my own post. Commenting is properly indented as far as I
have checked. I am not sure why you get the problem. May be some bug the

It's not a matter of informing. He is just expressing his concern over the
attitude towards learning.
One should have the openness to learn things, though he/she is an expert.
This is his advice/ prayer as far as I've understood.

This is a problem when replying from Gmail. People using gmail should leave
an empty line between quoted para
and their reply. Even though visually the reply is not indented in compose
window of Gmail, the quoting symbol (>)
is introduced in the first line of the reply.

Well written if a bit emotional. However you do injustice to the LUG
if you limit the attitude to the LUG and perhaps this specific LUG

None of the DRM / copy prevention schemes work because of the fundamental

I too have the same issue.
Choose System->Preferences->Sound. In the "Output" tab, choose "Audio
headphones" as the connector.
If there is an alternate way to do it automatically, please post it here.

I am afraid to let you know that, I cannot understand it! Because, my
scenario is:

1. My Koha is installed in /usr/local/koha/
2. It needs apache2 which is installed in configured in different
directories like /etc/  ... and... /usr/..
3. Koha needs perl dependencies, so, perl language is installed and
configured in various direction.

So, my point is: how can I make ISO from various sources of directories with
turnkeylinux?

How does FreeBSD 5.2.1 control the interrupt level?
For example, is it possible to block off network interrupts when servicing a
clock interrupt?
If so, how?  How are interrupt threads managed
(created/destroyed/scheduled)?

Look at Knoppix. It has instructions to create customised live cds. You can also have a look at debianlive at live.debian.net.

In short I dunno.

The long answer is that you should look at the FreeBSD kernel code.

It is very big compared to OpenBSD and you will have to spend a long time.

Normally however the clock interrupt gets the highest priority.

Normally interrupts on x86 are managed by the 8051 PIC I think.

It happens at the hardware level. Most of the time interrupt lines are
shared and daisy  chained.

I suggest two solutions,

1. Suse Studio.  Easiest, automated.
http://susestudio.com/

     a. Create an appliance with the requires softwares such as apache
     b. Run a Test drive and then  add your customizations
     c.  Go to overlay files and commit changes.
     d.  Rebuild your appliance in whatever format you want (iso, usb image,
vm image etc,)

2. Ubuntu LiveCD Customization

Buddy,

You gotta learn e-mail quoting.

You have been in LUG long enough...so you have learnt by now. ;)

Anyway just pulling your leg.

People should clearly know which part of the mail text is yours and
which someone else's.

Best of luck!

There are lot of noise in list these days. Top/bottom posting, sms language,
sending replies to password mails from mailman(?!) , the list goes on. Why
they
think that LUG members need to know their password is beyond my
comprehension.

I think some action need to be taken against people sending these spam.
IMHO,
the monthly reminders regarding list rules are not working. (Case in point:
a few days
ago someone replied to an automated mail containing few list rules violating
almost all
the rules given in that mail.)

Hello All,

I have a postfix server problem. I get the following lines in the
mail.log when I do "telnet localhost 25". I have looked a lot but unable
to fix this issue:

Sep 18 11:57:41 server postfix/smtpd[3796]: initializing the server-side

Sep 18 11:58:42 server postfix/smtpd[3796]: disconnect from

My two files are here:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5644455/main.cf

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5644455/master.cf

No matter what I do, it just fails with the above error all the time
when I am sending to external domain. Receiving works fine. But sending
fails when sending to external domain (like gmail, hotmail, or any other.)

Thank you for your help.

Who is this IP?

mail.domain.in?

I am unable to connect to it.

girish@vs1612:~$ nc -v 122.165.69.244 25
Warning: forward host lookup failed for
ABTS-TN-Static-244.69.165.122.airtelbroadband.in: Unknown host :

Nothing is running there. Some SMTP listener is needed there no?

Also, you could submit your custom appliance you built with suse studio to

Sorry, I was trying to hide my domain name and therefore changed it to
domain.in. And I turned it off for a while since we are still in very
initial stages. It is back UP now.

Thank you for looking at this. I tried but failed to get a solution
online, even though there are many such cases. I am working with Airtel
to get the reverse PTR record to my name as well.

Regards,
Abhishek

I guess, its not his mistake. Possibly, some strange issue with his email
client, which messes up the formatting.

Dear luggies,
Today (24/9/2010) on behalf of ILUGC I did a session lasting 2 1/2 hours on postgresql basics and optimisation of RDBMS at Loyola College, Chennai . The session was attended by about 50 students of second and third year MCA. The students are very good.

I thank the management and Prof.Nagarajan, HOD MCA for the opportunity.

You need to mention, distro name version etc.

Prima Facie, your problem appears to be a firewall issue.   In your
logs you get connection refused but a few moments ago  I tried 'telnet
 122.165.69.244 25' and the connection times out.  Assuming you have
your postfix/master daemon on, it implies inbound packets to port 25
are being dropped instead of a reject.

What is the output of 'iptables  --list' ?

I second the VM image solution.  Participants can do further
customization of the base image and you never know they may end up
using that for their own production.   openBRAVO

Take a look at the download options of openbravo - besides the tar

Welcome Asish,

>> what kind of Linux will be easy to start with? ubuntu/fedora

You can try any one of them!, my personal choice is ubuntu!.

The following urls will help you to install dualboot

http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Installing_Fedora_Linux_on_a_Windows_System_%28Dual_booting%29
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot

Please take up backup on the windows partition before you venture into
installing the dual boot .
Kindly consider searching for answers through popular search engine such as
google..
Wish you to have happy ,steady and stable experience with Free and Open
source OS.

always put a meaningful subject line. I have changed it for you. Fedora
is very easy to install. Boot from the dvd, follow the instructions and
you are done. For dual boot you can shrink the windows partition (during
the install) to create space. If you are unfortunate enough to have
windows 7, you will have to shrink the partition from within windows as
fedora cannot do that. (do not forget to do a tantric ritual called
'defrag' before shrink)

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=05yrvhy=cua9+gr5bwvPMpuEzhA+p2Zp7EYj+@mail.gmail.com>

Application: GNUstep

What it is:

GNUstep is a free software implementation of Cocoa  (formerly NeXT's
OpenStep) Objective-C  libraries (called frameworks), widget toolkit,
and application development tools not only for Unix-like  operating
systems, but also for Microsoft Windows. It is part of the GNU
Project.

Features:

GNUstep features a cross-platform, object-oriented development
environment. Like Apple, GNUstep also has a Java interface, as well as
Ruby [1]  and Scheme [2]  bindings. The GNUstep developers track some
additions to Apple's Cocoa  to remain compatible. The roots of the
GNUstep application interface are the same as the roots of Cocoa: NeXT
and OpenStep. GNUstep predates Cocoa.

To know more about:

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install gnustep

I recently faced such a situation once and I found that my filesystem
had no free space and it was causing that issue. Can you check in that
aspect by logging into the console? Yeah, there could be other reasons
as well.

Normally installing a new OS takes a few times to get right.

Avoid multiboot and keep trying.

Business Plan for what?   How is your query related to FOSS?

With all due respect to your query, you need to first have an idea
that you think will be accepted in the market and then develop a plan
on how to go about it i.e. your business plan.

csh and tcsh should never be used.

/bin/sh is most preferred.

PDKSH is the best shell.

Best of luck!

I used to have very good batchmates and classmates from Jammu in college.

Culturally you people seem to be far closer to Tamilians than the rest
of North India.

I am sure you guys have it within you do well like us.

Anyway to start a LUG in Jammu, you will need sound infrastructure.
Nowadays leased line and ADSL are
somewhat affordable.

I am not sure about the availability of BSNL in Jammu terrain.

I suppose it should be stable and that it would give you good bandwidth.

Once you obtain that you will need to install Linux and run mailman
Python based list manager like ILUGC.

After that your job is to attract users. ;)

Please don't hijack threads and ask your questions in separate
appropriately titled threads. Also your webmail interfaces is
haphazardly formatting your email making it very difficult to read.

Thats a nice idea ganesh. See if there is any other linux user groups in and
around your locality
Join them if you find any or create one yourself if there is none.
Check out http://ilugc.in for guidelines on how to start your own LUG (Linux

No. But, http://raviratlami1.blogspot.com/2007/11/how-to-install-tally-9-in-linux.html
seems to say it is possible.

Another dated release http://www.bbspl.com/linux_tally.htm says there
may be a linux version. May be you should talk to the vendor?

	Erode

Dear All,

I had conducted two days workshop @ Kongu Engineering College Erode. The
session been planned by their Department of Information Technology.  Their
were around 35 to 40 participants in the session. Day 1 started with the
LAMP with PHP and in the Day 2, covered the Python.

Its a pleasant  experience with the students and faculty's. The stage was
setup right for the learning.  Nice to see quite number of people using
GNU-Linux in the campus, thanks to the K-LUG.

My sincere thanks to the Asst. Prof. Shanta Kumari and other faculty members
for organizing this workshop for the benefit of their people.

wish itwould be nice if there exists such a group in coimbatore too . me and
my friends are very much excited to have such group in our city . If such a
community doesnt exist in coimbatore we invite all linux users and
volunteers to start one

Already few peoples ( Kenneth, Jeganath, Naveen, Ramkumar etc) are also
interested to form ILUG-Coimbatore. But we need enough strength. Amachu
assured for mailing list too.

cbe-linux exists on yahoogroups. This group has a steadily increasing
list of subscribers and occasional chatter. Unfortunately I have not
seen anyone located physically in and around the area on the list, so
there are no regular meets.

It will be a good idea to revive this group since it has a good number
of subscribers.

Hi,

> PDKSH is the best shell.

PDKSH supports the dialect of KSH88, which is now
obsolete. KSH93 (yes, the one written by David Korn) 
is the best shell for creating very large scripts.

KSH93  is now Free Software and available on most
Linux distros just a yum or aptitude away.

Just for info, KSH93 supports floating point 
arithmetic, typed variables, associative arrays pretty
much like other scripting languages. You can even 
compile your shell scripts to a byte code executable
which loads and runs faster.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar.

what do you mean by /bin/sh? It need not point to Bourne Shell always.
In Ubuntu it points to Dash as of now. It used to point to Bash, which is
also the case with Fedora.

It may also point to csh or tcsh. It points to whatever shell that is
the default
shell of that specific distro.

All the mails he has sent so far have been in this manner and

Coimbatore colleges -- especially the self-financing engg colleges -- have a
positive reputation of working in collaboration, e.g., they were among the
first to have common recruitment melas.

While the meet could be rotated amongst colleges, it may be preferable to
have an apex institution to fall back on.

some suggestions :
Sri Krishna College of Engg & Tech. ,
  contact :
  Dr. Ilango Krishnamurthy, Dean, CSE, ilango dot krishnamurthy at gmail dot
com    -- kenneth had interacted with him and conducted a programme or two.

  Dr. M. Tamizh Chelvan, Librarian  tamizhchelvan at hotmail dot com
  I was once told that the Correspondent of the college is very
knowledgeable about FOSS and suggests/recommends looking various FOSS
packages.

Amritha Vishwavidhyalay
  as I mentioned in my earlier mail, Prof Adhinarayan could be approached
and also his HoD Prof Gangadharan.

There are other institutions such as PSG Tech, CIT, Sri Ramakrishna College
of Engg, etc. -- but I am not quite sure about the connect between the
student activists and the dept persons.

with best wishes

some more suggestions

In the past 3 months I have started working with many self-financing
engineering colleges in and around coimbatore region (including erode,
namakkal dt).

Karpagam Institute of Technology, Bodipalayam, Coimbatore
Angel College of Engineering and Technology, Thiruppur
United Institute of Technology, Periyanaickenpalayam, Coimbatore
Info Institute of Engineering, Kovilpalayam, Coimbatore
Sengunthar Engineering College, Thiruchengode, Namakkal Dt.
Sengunthar College of Engineering, Thiruchengode, Namakkal Dt.
Excel College of Engineering for Women, Namakkal Dt.
Kongu Engineering College, Perundurai, Erode Dt.

Now, all the above colleges have open source lab setup and many students
were well exposed to them.  Interested people may also approach these
colleges for getting volunteers for LUG-Coimbatore

In the next 6-8 months, I have planned to work closely with atleast 50+
engg. colleges in the coimbatore region in establishing open source labs and
creating awareness among the students.  If anyone in this list (preferably
in the coimbatore region) is interested in volunteering this effort, they
may contact me offlist.

csh and tcsh are broken by design/implementation.
A lot bourne-compatible scripts break on csh/tcsh.
Put in simple words, they are not fully bourne
shell compatible. Secondly, csh/tcsh are not even
POSIX compliant.

Kindly look-up the following URL:
http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot/

POSIX standardized subset features of ksh88 -
which are implemented on most other shells like
pdksh, bash, dash and so on. Infact, some UNIXes
(BSDs in general) come with a POSIX compliant
shell replacing the default /bin/sh
(which traditionally used to be the bourne shell).

On many Linux distributions, bash replace /bin/sh,
on some distributions - it could be dash as they
are all POSIX compliant.

See above.

This is an indication of a totally broken distro that
needs to be fixed. By convention, /bin/sh on most
Linux/UNIX today must point to a POSIX compliant shell.

Hey 
I'm ganesh's friend Anirudh. We have a blogger page http://ilugcbe.blogspot.com. 
I'm going to create a web page and mailing list for us. There is a small mailing 
list we created using google friend connect but I'm not sure if it is 
sufficient. 

We have spoken to Aadhinaryanan Sir and there is an active foss club in our 
college, but we want to expand our horizons to the entire city. Ganesh and I 
will again meet him on Wednesday and ask if Amrita can be the backbone of the 
club and host the web infrastructure.

We also need suggestions for a meeting place. 

Im planning on a website, domain etc, and I have contacted balu at ilugc for the 
same.

And as we`ve just started so we decided to start with a Google group. Get

IIRC, ksh was written by David Korn, version/year does not matter.

Re webmin - beware and keep it up to date.  Although it is boon as an
administrative tool, it has a checkered history vis-a-vis security.
Also read other user feedback for a differing PoV.

I have found SystemRescueCD  <http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page> to
be an invaluable tool.   It has pretty much everything on it including
FREEDOS to flash your BIOS updates as well as a minimal  XFCE desktop
with gparted and a browser in case you need to research and download
updates.  Supports both i386 and amd64 kernels and tools.

Quite interesting argument

Long back when i was introduced to Linux philosophy , the first teachings
was that don't call it as linux  , call it as Gnu Linux .

That's the reason behind calling it as GLUGS .
Please correct me if I am wrong in this front.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy
http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html
http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#why
Quoting from the final link

Why do you call it GNU/Linux and not Linux?
    Most operating system distributions based on Linux as kernel are
basically modified versions of the GNU operating system. We began
developing GNU in 1984, years before Linus Torvalds started to write
his kernel. Our goal was to develop a complete free operating system.
Of course, we did not develop all the parts ourselves?but we led the
way. We developed most of the central components, forming the largest
single contribution to the whole system. The basic vision was ours
too.

    In fairness, we ought to get at least equal mention.

    See Linux and the GNU Project and GNU Users Who Have Never Heard of
GNU for more explanation, and The GNU Project for the history.

Atleast 2 things that you haven't done here
1. Come up with a good idea.
2. Communicate it clearly.

There has already been a very long discussion regarding this. Everyone
has the freedom to call it however they want to, after all freedom is
the core of free software. So lets not start another long discussion
regarding this or impose on others how we'd like to call the system.

          There is nothing wrong in calling it GLUG and I think ilugc
has already seen lots of arguments on this very topic. And the general
agreement was that we can call it in what ever way we prefer. So, lets
stop curtailing others freedom in calling it the way we want. As long
as there is no violation of the list guidelines, we have to restraint
ourselves from simply calling someone else wrong without a reason.
Thanks

So let *you* call it that way, not *us*.
So let every person call what he thinks is correct. Not what you think.
Don't impose your views.

Hi members,

I have given a lengthy description supporting my view .
I am ready to accept my fault if its my fault .
But please don't make a one line (to be precise 3 word) comment just to
prove that I am wrong .
As said by other members , Mr.Guruprasad and Mr.Balachandran Sivakumar
and stressed very strongly by &#2949;&#2965;&#3007;&#2994;&#2985;&#3021; ,
I am not taking this to yet another lengthy discussion , by respecting the
freedom and rights of the members.
In spite of that if you want to prove that GLUG is not a correct acronym
to be used , then I am ready to debate on it .

Regards,
K.Sibi

Thanks for sparing us :-)


Would be even better if you can follow the guidelines of

           He keeps repeating what he thinks is right and is trying to
force it on others. I guess it would be better to have the moderation
turned on again to avoid flame baits. Thanks

That's ok  . Everyone start small , added to that google groups offer

spam filtering .

All the best , looking forward to hear of any free software event from Jammu

whats difference between yourself and a proprietary software ?

Microsoft says , its a EULA and you got to accept it .

You say, I am wrong and every one else has to accept it .

You both will not give reasons :)

Give me valid reasons .. or at least give me a valid reason , I would
interrogate it .

Wow , A good beginning for the Glug,

cool - you were in Coimbatore and never started a lug or a glug and
never even contributed to any of the foss events in Coimbatore. I am not
in Coimbatore, but have contributed to most of the foss events there and
will be a loyal member of the upcoming LUG there. You are a team player
- I am not. But you are of no use to the people of Coimbatore - I am. I
suggest you take your glug and shove it.

Already LinuXpert Systems provided complete Fedora-13 Everything repository
(i386) and they have started using/distributing among them.

Myself with Mr.Rangarajan have also planned to do a FOSS seminar/workshop
after getting confirmation from University of Jammu.

There has been enough flaming, trolling and off-topic personal attacks
in this thread already. Let us stop all such things here.

Hello Guruprasad ,

I told repeatedly that I am not going to involve in any personal attacks
until provocative statements are issued against me . Once the personal
attack has started I cannot refrain myself . :(

I don't want to share what i think because i do *not* want to hijack this
thread and
start another flame war debating which way is correct.

Of course you were imposing your views!

I'm saying even expressing that is not correct in this scenario because
nobody was
discussing about *that topic* and your views were unnecessary noise!

It is your right to express your view in a public mailing list of which you
were a member
if that is *relevant* to the topic.

If someone had said 'App Y didn't work in Debian GNU/Linux' you are free to
reply 'Such
a such bug exists in Debian Linux'.  (This is what Sibi did in the first
place! he just called
it GNU/Linux and did not demand that the OP should call it Linux) But
instead you hijacked
the thread and demanded Sibi to call it Linux.

You are welcome to _express_ your views regarding naming issues in the
appropriate thread.
Please respect list guidelines and do not hijack threads.

PS: I request fellow members not to reply to that thread because we already
had enough flame wars
and have heard KG's views infinite number of times. Another flame is
unnecessary IMHO.

Ah .personal attack ...
I love it :)

>cool - you were in Coimbatore and never started a lug or a glug and
never even contributed to any of the foss events in Coimbatore

Want my track record in it ?

Here it comes  .

You missed my point . I never look up or go behind cheap publicity .

1.When I was in Chennai , just as a student I used to travel the ends of
Chennai , to organise and conduct events . With just a 30 rupees bus
ticket .I have never got the esteemed privilage of sitting in government's
money and travelling in cars nor sitting in AC rooms . Sweat  - I enjoyed
each and every drop of it when it trickled down .

2.Chennai colleges know it - Want to know the exact students I met or the
number of colleges I traveled ??

3.I was in Coimbatore for 7 months - a split of 2 months during june -
august 2009 and the last few months of my career - 3 months .SOme people
sitting in Chennai have been here since ages and allowed proprietary to
florish , wat could have i done  in 3 months ? Thats the reason i could
not contribute .Even in that dire circumstances , i have reached
engineering colleges , polytechnic colleges inn and around Coimbatore ,
plus Erode .

4.In the moths I was in Bangalore , I worked with most of the Glugs in
Bangalore colleges, simultaneous member of Free software movement
karnataka and Free software foundation, Tamilnadu . - Please refer to fsmk
(Free software movement karnataka ) for my contribution towars colleges in
Bangalore , Mysore .

5.I never told that you are not a team player, I just told we need team
players . Long ago I heard a tamil proverb
(&#2984;&#3009;&#2979;&#2994;&#3009;&#2990;&#3021;
&#2980;&#2985;&#3021;&#2997;&#3006;&#2991;&#3006;&#2994;&#3021;
&#2965;&#3014;&#2975;&#3009;m) , was searching for an example , gods grace
, found you .

6."No use" - Good word , good word . Appreciated .People always think to
impose their character on others.

7.Shove - just now  I referred my oxford dictionary and found that shove
means Push . Yes , we will push free software into young minds .

I would also shove anti-GNU people .

Since it was a personal attack on me , i too have attacked personally .
Who ever has/have committed mistake please replace "people" with your name
and read it and get angry . Others , I never hesitate - I am sorry :( . I
never meant to hurt you .

-Sibi

I suggest list members shall consider not replying to KG's mails.
This is not the first time he is attacking a person instead of idea.
He seems to go for personal attacks if he cannot provide valid points to
justify his ideas!

PS: This will be my last mail in this list in response to KG.

KG, get your facts right before you indulge in personal attacks.

For Sibi's contribution in Coimbatore:
http://www.hindu.com/2010/07/19/stories/2010071951770300.htm

>But you are of no use to the people of Coimbatore - I am.
This is no place for your personal rants.

And where are the moderators? Why does nobody take any sort of action on KG?
Are the moderators not worried about flame wars or personal attacks?
Why the special privilege to KG (the privilege of spamming my inbox
according to his whim). (This is not a personal attack on KG, but these
issues have been going on).

Except for being an (unsuspecting) accomplice in spamming the list with
invitations to social networks, users are free to say what they want! And I
like it that way. Thats what free speech is all about.

The list maintains its sanity (at least a semblance of it) because at some
point delinquent members realize their folly and correct themselves. KG is
the exception. So life goes on!

Hmm nice . DId the repo have packages from rpmfusion like 'media' stuff ?
Were these packages distributed via mirror or USB or some other media ?

local college students to contribute to their own pet open source project...

There is also Linux Weekly News:  http://lwn.net

You can subscribe at $42, $84, or $168 a year.

I don't subscribe, but if you are willing to shell out money, you
might want to consider lwn.

You'll have to download the kernel source form www.kernel.org and compile
the code. You'll have to use "make menuconfig" to get the configuration menu
and add/remove the required items in the kernel. If the purpose to change
the kernel is for an embedded processor then you'll need the cross
compilation tools to compile the code for the target device (make sure you
have the right version of gcc). Also you'll have default setting for certain
processors, based upon which you can do the required alterations.

If you have no previous knowledge of Linux kernel or OS kernels in
general, you could download the source code and start studying it in
parallel with reading about Linux kernel from some standard books like
'Understanding the Linux kernel' by O'Reilly or some standard
documentation online. When you are stuck somewhere in this process,
you can always ask for help in clarifying the concepts. This will get
you started on your aim to modify the Linux kernel for your needs.

Dear luggies,

On behalf of ILUGC, K.Baskar and myself did a FOSS introduction session in Apollo Arts and Science College, Off Poonamallee  today(29/9/2010). The session was attended by about 180 students of B.Sc and M.Sc. The topics covered were FOSS introduction, GUI and packages, web development using CMS and Framework. The response from the students was good.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank the management and Prof.Anupriya, HOD Software Development for the opportunity.

Hi, I have been trying to run a 3gp file with *rtsp*. This file is in
/usr/local/movies of one CentOS machine. I cannot load that video from my
blackberry or VLC / MPlayer. It shows me the error: "Unable to Load". Though
that file is there in that directory with perfect permission status.

Here is the mp4info of that file:

Message-ID: <AANLkTin0O8rPQOW5TUP7LTegH3hW+yKTXB9eUB5zVZz+@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Was just curious about this:

I have seen organisations charge for services for OSS.

Some even produce complete products that use OSS along with other
custom-developed(proprietary) apps and sell them.

Wouldn't it be illegal to market a suite of OSS customized to a
particular business requirement and hosted on
a private cloud or whatever(making it a service)?

All the while re-branding the underlying OSS, thereby to some degree
hiding the facts from customers.

Do open licenses allow this kind of freedom?

Yes.

It is not illegal. It is just a question of whether it is the right
thing to do, depending on how you look at it.

IANAL, but the GPLv3 and Affero GPLv3 closes this application service
provider loop-hole. One needs to provide the source code of any Free
Software service that is run over a network under these licenses.

GPLv3 does too, in a way, that if one distributes GPLv3 object code
via the web or an FTP server, they must provide instructions for users
to download the source. Of course, this was primarily meant for
binaries for embedded/hardware, while, AGPLv3 was for application
service providers/web applications.

It is not a canned answer.

First thing is don't use C++. People think C++ is an improvement on C.

Second thing is never use threading.

I believe in the above myself, but for the most part, it really does
not make that much of a difference. The biggest performance killer in
most cases is I/O. Do I/O efficiently and half the battle is won.

Nonsense. Read the slides again. I can't see how one can conclude that
threads are performance blockers and should always be avoided based on
those slides. Those slides try to show how event driven programming is
an easier alternative in a lot of cases. The slides are from 1997 and
they quote desktop environments as being single threaded. They haven't
been single threaded for quite some time now. Threads are fantastic if
you know how to use them.

Hi,

My friend's company wants to send monthly newsletter to all the customers.
They need a FOSS web based newsletter and subscription management software.

I suggested PHPList.

Is there other good software?

Thanks.

which license are you talking about? as far as BSD license is concerned,
you can make the app proprietary and sell it too, as long as you change
the name and do not claim that the original authors have anything to do
with it. For GPL you cannot do this - other licenses have varying
restrictions - GPL most restrictive and BSD most free.

As long its a service that is built using software components (OSS,
propreitary, whatever) then the vendor is not encumbered in any way. That
is, as long as the software components are not under Affero GPL. Thats why
its legal for google to run its infrastructure on a modified linux kernel
and still not share the modifications with its users.

Kenneth is quite accurate.

Look at what company does.

I take OpenBSD and commercialize it. In the BSD world OpenBSD allows
the maximum freedom.

But most people have their noses stuck in the sand like an ostrich and
their vision gets clouded
 the moment they see beyond Linux.

With Linux a lot of things are unclear. In the GNU world Stallman has
made life hell for commercial folks.

He himself does not know what he wants.

These problems are avoided in toto when you embrace the BSD world and
in particular OpenBSD.

Best of luck with your commercial endeavors.

I guess mailman would be a good fit too.

It is Python and works quite well.

It depends on who wants/gets the freedom. GPL ensures that the end

Care to elaborate on this ? While I understand and respect the choice of BSD 
users, making sweeping statements such as the above serves no purpose except 
confuse people.

There is *nothing* unclear about either Linux or GPL. Yes, you may say that in 
/your/ definition of freedom, the GPL is less free, but in the FSF's definition 
of freedom, the GPL is free. However that doesn't make it 'unclear', it makes it 
'different'.

Also, what exactly do you mean by generalizations such as 'Stallman has made 
life hell for commercial folks' ? References please.

> He himself does not know what he wants.
>

Heh, this is so far away from the truth ! Stallman knows /exactly/ what he 
wants, even to the point of being stubborn, inflexible and annoying at times ! 
His principles have been consistently been proved right, be it the SCO trials, 
the dangers of Java/.NET, software patents ...etc. If anything at all, Stallman 
is consistent and stubborn in his beliefs. Saying he does not know what he 
wants, proves you do not know what you are talking about.

I never said there aren't companies that make/use Free Software under
GPL. There are, and they do make lot of money, and still give the
source away :)

The Linux kernel, under GPL, with code contributions from various
companies is an example.

Can't say about python and postgresql but Apple sure benefits from the ^freedom^ 
of BSD whereas Apple users don't :).

That's just one example.

Anyways, note the smiley, I do not wish to engage in a BSD Vs GPL flame (at 
least not with someone to knows the facts and then chooses one over the other).

ehe, not quite sure what you are referring to here. AFAIK, MySQL has not (yet!) 
been harmed. In anycase, even if it does, the option of a fork always exists, as 
well demonstrated by the recent creation of LibreOffice [1]

This ^^^^ is not consistent with your requirement to have read only access for 
anonymous user. What exactly do you mean by 'Anonymous' can 'copy' ?

Anyways, here is a nice article that might help:
http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch15_:_Linux_FTP_Server_Setup#The_vsftpd.conf_File

If you still have problems, it might help to know what exactly happens (or does 
not happen as expected) along with the current configuration.

In any case, you should consider creating a complete read-only ftp server with 
users using scp to copy files instead of ftp, since that is more secure.

cheers,

+1.
Yes mailman can do much more than that - it is much suitable for a
discussion list. For just sending newsletters one-way communication may be
enough, I'm not sure if any other software suits better for announcement
lists. Anyway mailman should satisfy your requirements best AFAIK.
I have no experience with PHPList.

This question is too generic to answer sensibly. Consider the following points:

a. Is your application I/O bound or CPU bound (ie: does it do mostly I/O or is 
it CPU intensive ?)
b. What do you define as 'performance' ? Low memory consumption ? Low 
latency/high user responsiveness ? Fast processing ?
c. What is the environment in which your application executes ? (ie: what are 
the external dependencies of the application's input and output ?)

The first step to 'improving the performance' is 'understanding the performance' 
of your application. So, I would recommend running your application under a 
profiler (there are tons of them out there both generic and specialized tools).

Don't do this without first understanding why one would need to do this and even 
then don't do it without evaluating what other options are available. I say this 
because, writing multi-threaded code more often than not is too much effort to 
solve the wrong problem :-). That is to say, if you are converting single 
threaded code to multi-threaded /only/ for the sake of perceived gain in 
performance then don't do it.

strace/ltrace (especially the -C option), gprof, oprofile ...and simple printf, 
if used sensibly.

Please dont make such absurd statements. That you do not understand what
Stallman wants does not mean that he himself does not know what he wants!
When none bothered about the software world becoming proprietary the vision
of a single man has led to such a reach of Free Software (just my usage, I
don't bother if somebody calls it Open Source) among end users. He has been
very clear and consistent in his stand and that's why he has been able to
create a movement.
If you can't understand his stand I pity you :-(

I thought we were discussing licenses. And, over the years I have
noticed that Kenneth always has something bad to say about RMS. People
for the contributions like GNU Emacs, GCC etc. that RMS has made and
nitpick. Really bad

When someone can mindlessly keep shouting their opinions in the face
of others irrespective of the situation, RMS too can, it is our
freedom to take it or throw it. Btw, what relevance does it have to be
discussed in ILUGC? Is this an attack on RMS because he can't respond?

why really bad? Do I not have the right to criticise someone? There are
a lot of good things about Stallman - but he is not god and he is not
above criticism. I am not actually criticising him - I am critical of
the blind subservience to him and his ideas by many people. I am
critical of ESR for many of his views like gun control and how to deal
with west asia - and critical of linus for his over-emphatic advocacy of
git ... And anyway, none of my criticisms will have any effect on his
devotees - those who worship him will continue to do so.

The latter case is better. Someone has to go to his blog to read it.
But in former case I get bombarded by silly emails in my inbox that has
no relevance as to the topic which i thought would be discussed when i
allowed those mails to hit my inbox. :-(

Hi,

I had scheduled to conduct a one-day Free Software workshop on the
following topics at Mepco Schlenk Engineering College, Sivakasi, Tamil
Nadu, India [1] on Saturday, October 2, 2010, but, had to cancel the
trip in the last moment:

* di-git-ally-managing-love-letters: Session on git [2]

* i-want-2-do-project. tell-me-wat-2-do-fedora [3]

* Packaging RPM (Fedora) [4]

Today, I coordinated with their lab system administrator to try to
install and get IRC working [5] from the computers in the seminar hall
and the labs through their proxy, so we could possibly do an online
IRC training session in #fedora-india channel. It has been done now!

I would appreciate if there are more people who can also join in as
trainers for the online sessions between 0930 and 1700 IST on
Saturday, October 2, 2010, in case, I face Internet connectivity
problems or power failures in Hyderabad. If you are interested, please
let me know. My IRC nick is "mbuf" on irc.freenode.net. Everyone is
welcome to participate in the IRC sessions as well.

Thanks,

When someone says something different from normal perception people call it
absurd, but we should keep in mind that people called Galileo absurd when he
said that earth is spherical, not flat!
I don't want to spam this thread more. I'm stopping with this.

@KG: AFAIK the only contribution you have done to this mailing list is
hijacking threads, criticizing people and personal attacks and imposing your
views on others.
I've seen mails of KG *shouting* not to violate list rules by top-posting
and other things, but the *contributions* said above are much more annoying
than what he shouts at. I don't understand why moderators are so silent in
such cases.
@Moderators: Please do not let those who join here newly to get frightened

Serves no purpose other than to confuse people? I disagree. It serves a
very specific purpose. You see, the ilugc mailing list must have atleast
one flamewar every few weeks. Tune in next month for vi-vs-emacs if
you're not interested in this one.

The signal-to-noise here is abysmal. But that's how we like it.

Care to elaborate on this ? While I understand and respect the opinion that 
signal-to-noise ratio here is not ideal, making sweeping statements such as the 
above serves no purpose except increase responses such as this.

Using correct terminology, 1) anon users can only download but not upload
and 2) authenticated users can download as well as upload.

I use pureftpd instead of vsftp, so the below is untested but it should
mostly work.  Please post again if you run into any issues.


> listen=YES
> local_enable=YES
> anonymous_enable=YES
> write_enable=YES
> local_umask=077

Config looks okay so far, assuming your FTP root is /var/ftp, do this:

1. chgrp ftp /var/ftp  # your ftp root
3. chmod g+s /var/ftp
3. Set local_umask=002 in your vsftpd.conf

This creates all files/dirs with group ownership set to "ftp" and group
writeable.  Authenticated users will be able to modify files uploaded
by other authenticated users as well.  Anon can only download.


> anon_upload_enable=YES

Set this to NO to disable anon users from uploading files.  This config
is contrary to what you are trying to do.


An ftp server with anon upload permissions is ripe for abuse unless
configured correctly.

I ran an ftp server in the 90's which was hacked and used for hosting
warez, it had a dir named named ". " (that's a dot followed by a space
character) which was full of unwanted files.

To securely allow anon FTP uploads, restrict all anon uploads to a
/incoming dir, and deny anon users from downloading from this /incoming
dir.  Then setup an /outgoing or /pub dir where anon users can download
but not upload anything.  You can also serve the same /outgoing folder
over http.  Only authenticated users can move files from /incoming to /outgoing.

I run a PureFTP server setup like this at work and so far my server has never
been abused.

Please dont make such absurd statements. That you do not understand what
Stallman wants does not mean that he himself does not know what he wants!
When none bothered about the software world becoming proprietary the vision
of a single man has led to such a reach of Free Software (just my usage, I
don't bother if somebody calls it Open Source) among end users. He has been
very clear and consistent in his stand and that's why he has been able to
create a movement.
If you can't understand his stand I pity you :-(

* <http://krvignesh.wordpress.com/>*Yes. Thats true. Stallman's idea has
lead to the development of Free Software till now. There wouldn't be a great
movement what we have now in our midst. I do not know about others. But, as
far i know, STallman's idea has lead students like me to work freely with
the code. No one can replace Stallman or no one can throw absurdities on
him. IF you don't like STallman's idea, i would advise you to stand away
from Free Software. HIs movement is appreciated among the student community
who would like to learn and develop themselves,

Friends.

I hope most of the people here are matured enough to
follow the mailing list guidelines.

When someone crosses the border, it is our responsibility
to guide him/her not to do so and suggest the proper way of mailing.

We often get the email from new members,
with no subjects
with sms language
top posting
thread hijacking
etc.

It is all our duty to educate the new members to do the things
correctly in a polite way.
We are doing the same, but in a hard way.

I have heard a lot of people fearing to send email to the list.

"You people are scolding me a lot"
"You are always fighting"
"I am afraid to send email. someone will blast me"

These are some words from the people who afraid to send even a single
mail to our list.
I am hearing the same for past 1-2 years.

Have anyone heard the same?

Shall we discuss something interesting to improve our quality?
How to make our list new members friendly with maintaining the guidelines?

Please share your thoughts.

Great Mail. Knowing about the conservative approach  of our community if we

First, let us agree not to allow any person to use harsh language against
newcomers for violating seemingly innocuous rules like top-posting. The
irony is
that these people contribute more noise by hi-jacking and ranting
unnecessarily!

* If they continue to violate (May be a three strikes policy?) banning them
temporarily
   will let them know that following rules is important! (When they won't
listen to friendly
   nudge there is no point in remaining friendly.)

* At some point of time the temporary ban should be made permanent (2nd or
3rd ban?).

* Please ban any member involving in personal attacks. Lets debate about
ideas; not fight over persons!

* Any member using harsh language against newcomers may also be warned and
banned at third strike.

More to come. Stay tuned. :p

PS: How to keep track of offending persons? Is there any such option
available in Mailman?

A clarification. Here 'they' in 'they continue to' refers to newbies who are
violating the list rules. Not the persons using harsh words against them.
Those persons are dealt in last point.

Subject: [Ilugc] OAOD (Miro)
Message-ID: <AANLkTik4Ldp5JxLnEjhbCqbFp_PF2f8MAjji+zVPROWH@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Miro

What it is:

Miro (previously known as Democracy Player) is a platform for Internet
television and video.
It allows you to download and watch videos from RSS feeds (including
podcasts, video blogs, and BitTorrent feeds).

Features:

Miro can automatically download videos from RSS-based ?channels?,
manage them and play them. The application is designed to mesh with
other PCF products such as Video Bomb, a social tagging video website,
and the Channel Channel, a TV guide for Internet television.

Miro integrates an RSS aggregator, a BitTorrent client (based on
libtorrent), and a media player (VLC media player under Windows,
QuickTime under Mac OS X, and Xine Media Player or GStreamer under
Linux). Since 2.0, Miro supports the adding of website bookmarks under
the ?Sites? category; by default, ClearBits.net is preloaded in Miro
as a bookmark.

Examples of supported video files are QuickTime, WMV, MPEG, AVI, XVID
as a video player. It also supports RSS BitTorrent. When a new video
is available, the program will notify and download if possible.

The Miro Video Converter, a separate free program, converts video formats.

To install in Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install miro

Subject: [Ilugc] lets compile useful links and recommend websites for free
 and open source software
Message-ID: <AANLkTikWykaWoKQpQUOq+4Y4nvWrogNu+jc2CZ5f+z4-@mail.gmail.com>

All,

There are tons and tons information out their in the WWW. There are many
drowned with the information when they search in the internet, they
struggle,   not sure which one to pick from the listed links. That too think
about a fresh man [1] life, pathetic, most time people spend their time in
the search engine rather into the content what they are looking for. It
would good when we give them what they are looking for. Something like  FVL
[2] as in FAQ. I hope it [2] would resolve lot of overheads for many, save
their sitting with the search engines.

Friends, I  request you to spare some of your valuable time in contribute to
compiling the useful links regarding the GNU Linux and FOSS, which you used
as a reference materials, tutorials and handbooks. In whatever form it could
be feel free to share the link. Is it a big deal to do that in your busy
schedule ?. Yes if you think as yes. Other wise, check for the bookmarks in
your browsers you already got it what we want, Kindly copy and paste,
whatever you feel like sharing with rest of list.

The  next big question, where to paste it. We could create a new page in
ILUGC Wiki  [3] for this and compile those links.  Feel free to write your
comments.

Thanks in advanced.
