Hi Shakthi Kannan,

Thank you for your great efforts, I feel that we can have the
INSTALLFEST on the venue. Now we have to concentrate on the volunteer
part and the distributions that we need to show for the INSTALLFEST.
Kindly share your suggestions.

The date is set on Saturday, March 28, 2015 at the MSI, Chennai office
premises. I am still working on the other logistics.

To maintain transparency, I would like each interested participant to
reply to this thread with the following info:

  * Full name
  * What hardware do you plan to bring (laptop/PC and accessories)?
  * What GNU/Linux distribution do you need?
  * What you intend to work on?
  * Anything else you require during the installfest?

Since, the space is limited and we can accommodate only 25 people,
this edition shall be on a first-come, first-serve basis.

With regards,

SK

Hi All,

I am posting in this forum after a very long time.

I got an idea about the "Cloud In a Box" appliance.

The details about this is posted in my blog @

Please, kindly go through it and give your valuable suggestions/feedbacks.

I would like to know about the future of this business model and how well
it will be success.

I know that the word "Cloud" is a super duper hype.

Hi AK,

I don't have any experience with above mentioned boards.

Recently I bought, NUC (i5 + 16GB + SSD-256GB + HDD-1TB) for $1K.
Performance is good for its size and price. Linux support is also good.
Atom model price seems to be less. May be check the local price.

Intel NUC Atom board (

Message-ID: <CAEkH89NPYMeJSV5m_s+2KMBtL_u+10EeOR9yhAcS9v53Dtphfw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

A friend of mine, Noufal[1] as part of the Pipal Academy[2] is
planning to conduct a paid Git workshop in the city and he wanted to
know if there would be enough takers for it.

Noufal has conducted a few of them before as well and they have all
been very well received.  Here is a bit about the workshop:

"A 2 day git workshop that covers the popular distributed version
control system inside out. A course valuable to all programmers who
stumble around with git and memorise commands to "get out of
situations" rather than develop a good mental model of git that makes
them self reliant, confident and effective with the tool."

and a bit about him:

"My name is Noufal Ibrahim. I've been teaching git professionally for
around 5 years now. I've taught it to several corporate audiences and
have conducted public classes before in association with hasgeek. I've
been very active answering git questions on stackoverflow."

It would be much appreciated if the people who are interested could
reply here indicating the same. This will give Noufal a decent idea of
the kind of demand.

He plans to have the workshop sometime in the month of April and it
will be on a Saturday and Sunday.

Please feel free to write in with any questions and if you want more
details as to which topics will be covered.

Thanks & Best Regards,
Shrayas

So can I assume you'll attend it then? :)

Also He's really good in this area. Ive heard many people saying the same
thing.

If the money is the issue, consider getting it sponsored by your company.
And I think it is money well spent. The topics covered are very vast. If
required, I could send those across as well.

Hi,

I have a requirement to create a custom Content Management Systems (CMS)
for my client and I have question regarding how the images, audio and other
media files are stored in CMS systems.  I have referred some open CMS db
designs and they looks like stored in db.  If it is the case how does it is
rendered? I am not clear on that part.

If any one has expert knowledge on CMS please advice.

Thank you

After pulling the content from the db, you'll have to set the appropriate
'Content-Type' http header before sending it to the browser. The browser
handles the rendering based on this header.

Storing media files in Db is not preferred.
Hash the name of the files and store in a folder where cms has access.
In the Db, store the path, original name and hash.

Great thank you Mano and Shrini,
It looks like the idea of having it stored and hash its location seems to
be better for my design  I will try that solution

Subject: [Ilugc] Request participation for MOOC Research Study
Message-ID: <CAO+6=i4Ni_5pcGYyFBGZy1QD84tst9iVyJZkeu5-Bf-wtjkMYg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Of the recent trends in education, Massive Online Open Courseware(MOOC) is
certainly a very innovative offering. Some educationalists hail it as the
next era of education and some postulate that it need not be. While a lot
of research is founded on how educationalists produce these lectures and
how students fare in these systems, it is important to know what the
learners think!

To address this, I have taken up the research on consumption drivers,
interactions and perceptions of MOOCs towards my research at Amrita
University.

One component of my research is a consumer survey requesting responses from
Indian Learners. In fact we are all life long learners, aren't we? :) Hence
this survey is for every learning Indian.

Participating in this survey would lead to a significant contribution to
education by learning from learners how they perceive and use or not use
MOOCs. This is the link to the survey:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1c5vFi375W45BP7m3B6KHHuyLSMIFCfayg8Ujbf8enPo/viewform

The Linux Users Group is undoubtedly a group of spirited people and
learning is our passion. Hence your participation would be of best
relevance. So please do not consider this as a random spam.

Also please share this survey with anyone whose response you think, would
be a key input.

I am more than willing to share the resulting insights from this study to
everyone. Please help me solicit pan-India responses for this research
study.

Sincerely,
Soorya Narayan DG

Engineers <engineering at lists.wikimedia.org>,
mediawiki-api at lists.wikimedia.org


Hello all,

I am happy to announce the beta release of the Wikimedia REST Content API
at

https://rest.wikimedia.org/

Each domain has its own API documentation, which is auto-generated from
Swagger API specs. For example, here is the link for the English Wikipedia:

https://rest.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/v1/?doc

At present, this API provides convenient and low-latency access to article
HTML, page metadata and content conversions between HTML and wikitext.
After extensive testing we are confident that these endpoints are ready for
production use, but have marked them as 'unstable' until we have also
validated this with production users. You can start writing applications
that depend on it now, if you aren't afraid of possible minor changes
before transitioning to 'stable' status. For the definition of the terms
?stable? and ?unstable? see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API_versioning .

While general and not specific to VisualEditor, the selection of endpoints
reflects this release's focus on speeding up VisualEditor. By storing
private Parsoid round-trip information separately, we were able to reduce
the HTML size by about 40%. This in turn reduces network transfer and
processing times, which will make loading and saving with VisualEditor
faster. We are also switching from a cache to actual storage, which will
eliminate slow VisualEditor loads caused by cache misses. Other users of
Parsoid HTML like Flow, HTML dumps, the OCG PDF renderer or Content
translation will benefit similarly.

But, we are not done yet. In the medium term, we plan to further reduce the
HTML size by separating out all read-write metadata. This should allow us
to use Parsoid HTML with its semantic markup
<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsoid/MediaWiki_DOM_spec> directly for
both views and editing without increasing the HTML size over the current
output. Combined with performance work in VisualEditor, this has the
potential to make switching to visual editing instantaneous and free of any
scrolling.

We are also investigating a sub-page-level edit API for micro-contributions
and very fast VisualEditor saves. HTML saves don't necessarily have to wait
for the page to re-render from wikitext, which means that we can
potentially make them faster than wikitext saves. For this to work we'll
need to minimize network transfer and processing time on both client and
server.

More generally, this API is intended to be the beginning of a multi-purpose
content API. Its implementation (RESTBase
<http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/RESTBase>) is driven by a declarative
Swagger API specification, which helps to make it straightforward to extend
the API with new entry points. The same API spec is also used to
auto-generate the aforementioned sandbox environment, complete with handy
"try it" buttons. So, please give it a try and let us know what you think!

This API is currently unmetered; we recommend that users not perform more
than 200 requests per second and may implement limitations if necessary.

I also want to use this opportunity to thank all contributors who made this
possible:

- Marko Obrovac, Eric Evans, James Douglas and Hardik Juneja on the
Services team worked hard to build RESTBase, and to make it as extensible
and clean as it is now.

- Filippo Giunchedi, Alex Kosiaris, Andrew Otto, Faidon Liambotis, Rob
Halsell and Mark Bergsma helped to procure and set up the Cassandra storage
cluster backing this API.

- The Parsoid team with Subbu Sastry, Arlo Breault, C. Scott Ananian and
Marc Ordinas i Llopis is solving the extremely difficult task of converting
between wikitext and HTML, and built a new API that lets us retrieve and
pass in metadata separately.

- On the MediaWiki core team, Brad Jorsch quickly created a minimal
authorization API that will let us support private wikis, and Aaron Schulz,
Alex Monk and Ori Livneh built and extended the VirtualRestService that
lets VisualEditor and MediaWiki in general easily access external services.

We welcome your feedback here: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Talk:RESTBase
- and in Phabricator
<https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/create/?projects=RESTBase&title=Feedback:>
.

Friends,

I am trying to audit the web application we create.

Exploring the tools mentioned in
http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/14-popular-web-application-vulnerability-scanners/

They work good for the application with no login or with HTTP authentication.
But, our web applications have custom login form.

How to audit the web applications behind the login form?

Please share the info about the tools you use.

Thanks.

One approach would be to make a list of all server requests (ajax and
non-ajax) that are accessible only to authenticated users and then access
them without being logged in using the browser console or curl. Sometimes
the frontend scripts could be the only layer that is enforcing some
(pseudo) control while the backend could be leaking information. The above
can catch such gaps.

Cheers,
mano

Shrini,

Your requirement will be satisfied by a dynamic analyzer - try HP
webinspect. It's not open source though.
You can download an evaluation version - for 14 days i guess and try
running it. You give the login credentials in the tool and the tool will
crawl the web pages and will try to exploit the application using known
hacking techniques. It will basically check for owasp top ten
vulnerabilities and the likes.

Hope it helps!

Thanks
Azeez

Hi,
Recently I have shifted to using Linux on my laptop from windows. Two days
back I have formatted windows and got Ubuntu 13.04 installed. Now I have
plenty of questions. I need some leads to go on finding the answers. Till
now I could not even add the "flash" plugin. Can you guide me through the
basics. Maybe suggesting a book or something.  Something to go on. :)

Then meanwhile I did some R&D on my own which failed and my laptop is
locked. It is not accepting my previous password. It would be helpful if
anybody is available for support.
Thanks

Hi there,
Ubuntu 13.04 doesn't have long support(two year support from 2013) . I
recommend installing either 12.04 or 14.04 having 5 year support.

Since your distribution isn't accepting your password. Quick resort is to
re-install by making a bootable usb. You can use guest login for any
troubleshooting also on ubuntu(No password needed).

Cheers

Hi All,

One of my client is planning for setup a cost effective contact center. He
is planning for 40 Seats. I am suggesting him to go for thin client.

HP t200 seems to be viable. But most of the features are only for windows.

Is there any Thin Client available with linux support.

You shouldn?t have problems with either webscarab or w3af, both of these 
AFAIK support
you executing logins over http.

webscarab or any http proxy will grab the relevant information for you - 
you can then manipulate those values in order
to pen test your application.

The proprietary tools make this step a bit more point and click, but 
essentially do the same thing.

Try HCL, they have thin clients, we bought some 5 years ago. It comes

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] Speaker wanted for MetaRefresh run-up event in Chennai
	on March 21st
Message-ID: <CAEkH89MSQCjyZ9Nu-T3hbMP=A6rUbjvXeSARSg+WmukrycZS2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Tony from HasGeek[1] reached out to me looking for people to speak at
their upcoming run-up event[2] for their MetaRefresh[3] conference.

Here is an excerpt from the run-up event page:

"Now a days we are faced with the challenge of developing and
maintaining websites handling data that changes with time. What are
the best practices, tools and frameworks at this job?

The focus of the meet will be to explore the aspects of designing
mobile websites with data that invariably changes over time."

Interested people can connect with tony at tony at hasgeek.com to carry
things forward.

Best Regards,
Shrayas

Checkout the complete testing story for qml apps now on developer.ubuntu.com!

https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/apps/quality/

The example application has been covered with best practices for test
writing, and includes guides to help you write unit and integration
tests in qml for your application. If you are groaning at the thought
of testing, think again. Unit tests especially are amazingly easy to
write -- you likely already know qml.

Let me know your thoughts and if there's other quality related content
you'd like to see.

Message-ID: <CAND2794Sh564p9ZU7Oh88kKGx5G1JGaXmLJzdhMu=dJixoPA4A@mail.gmail.com>

Friends,

I have a AWS instance where I have installed 20 rails applications.
It took much time to setup by installing various dependencies.
Base os is ubuntu 14.04

Now, we need the same setup in a physical server.
we will need to setup multiple servers with the same applications.

Is there any way to bundle the entire setup from AWS and deploy in
the multiple physical servers with less hazzle?

Share your thoughts.

Thanks.

Yes. It is next to Sankara Vidyala school bus stop, and opposite to
Christ King convent bus stop, Tambaram East.

If you are coming from Velachery, you can use buses A51, 5A or V51
(this is a longer route), and get down at Christ King convent bus
stop, and walk across the road.

If you are coming from Mount Road towards Tambaram, you need to take
any bus from Tambaram East that goes through Velachery main road, and
the Sankara Vidyala school bus stop is the second stop.

If you wish to attend please reply with the following info before
Friday, March 20, 2015 2359 IST:

  * Full name
  * What hardware do you plan to bring (laptop/PC and accessories)?
  * What GNU/Linux distribution do you need?
  * What you intend to work on?
  * Anything else you require during the installfest?

There were few ILUG-C banners that were made many years ago. For example:

  http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album35?page=6

  http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album35/54_banners_outside

May I know who is in possession of the same? I would like to borrow
them, use them for this event and return it back.

Please let me know,

Thanks!

Okay. You can pair with Vigneshwaran for Mint installation.

We don't have hardware for your testing. The reason to bring hardware
is that we can help you during the installfest, instead of you having
to try it out at home.

You can join in though.

Subject: [Ilugc] Diaspora Workshop
Message-ID: <CAND2795Q1NrgSXtgDLni9J==-9my5bz46DP974KtyRsFS2jgUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Have you heard of Ello? The social networking site was launched as an
alternative to Facebook. But long before Ello, there was Diaspora, a
social network that gives you control over your data and lets you
set-up your own social networks!

IITM Linux Users Group invites you to explore the world of Diaspora
through a workshop.

Date: March 21, 2015 (Saturday)
Time: 10:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.
Venue: Computer Science Block, CSB 25

Diaspora is a nonprofit, user-owned, distributed social network that
is based upon the free Diaspora software. Diaspora consists of a group
of independently owned nodes (called pods) which interoperate to form
the network. Anyone can run the Diaspora software on their own server
(called a diaspora pod) and these pods can communicate with each
other, thus forming one single community that is spread across
thousands of servers worldwide.

The session will be focused on:

Introduction to decentralized social networks and encryption
Hands on session to setup a diaspora service in local server
Benefits of contributing to Free Software
How we can contribute to diaspora?
fixing small bugs
learning the git workflow
seek innovative solutions to decentralization challenges
how to setup pod migration
distributed authentication and api
directory service for easy user discovery
public post aggregation and searching
adding new features like events and groups
package diaspora for debian, fedora and other distributions

Everyone is free to attend the session! The only per-requisite is your
interest in social networks.

Also, requesting everyone to bring your laptop.

Message-ID: <CAND2796WbuppPLp+OoqQ9+Lh6UEnJXEyr+EOjHXj8nVOd6e5NQ@mail.gmail.com>

Friends,

I use tabs in gnome terminal and konsole.
each tab maintains its own history.

It is very tough to find a previously ran command,
as I have to open the same number of tab, to find it in history.

Why it is designed so?

How to merge all the tab's commands in single history file,
so that we can access the history from any shell.?

Thanks.

Every one will eventually learn from one another, but, it is important
that you come with an objective in mind. Please provide the following
info:

  * Full name
  * What hardware do you plan to bring (laptop/PC and accessories)?
  * What GNU/Linux distribution do you need?
  * What you intend to work on?
  * Anything else you require during the installfest?

An installfest is not just about installation. You can always work on
system setups, configuration, testing and experimentation. You are
welcome to help others.

Please provide an objective that you wish to try or learn.

That is what I asked you to let us know. Learning is a continuous
process, and there is something to be learnt every day. A demo is
scheduled at the end of the Installfest.

Please let me know by today on what you want to learn during the Installfest .

Thanks!

Your query has nothing to do with Amazon. Use Capistrano to automate
deployment of Rails applications:

Help ubuntu by testing the iso.

---------- Forwarded message ----------

Subject: Final Beta Testing Week
To: "ubuntu-quality at lists.ubuntu.com" <ubuntu-quality at lists.ubuntu.com>


It's here! Final beta images and milestone will be appearing on the tracker
by early tomorrow AM UTC. Look for the milestone under vivid on
http://iso.qa.ubuntu.com/.

Plan to help test by grabbing the images when they hit the tracker and
reporting your results! I'll post again when the milestone link is live
(assuming elfy or someone else in Europe doesn't beat me to it!)

If you are new to this whole image testing thing, do have a look at the
wiki walkthrough https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/ISO/Walkthrough for help.
In a nutshell, download the image and run through the installation
testcases on your machine. The images are linked from the testcase and come
from cdimage.ubuntu.com. Real hardware is preferred, but feel free to test
on a virtual machine too. Submit your testcase result and perform the next
test.

Thanks and happy testing everyone!

Nicholas

I found a similar query on another site as well, although I have not tried
that method by myself but IMO that should work.

Message-ID: <CAFPraRydzxqDFs+bp=x+pUwYMCn3fNqBboHLsa+_n+1EBFXCgg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,
             I have a Cent OS 7 installed and configured a service test to
run in level 3,4 and 5

[root at karthikeyan-server]# chkconfig test --list

Note: This output shows SysV services only and does not include native
      systemd services. SysV configuration data might be overridden by
native
      systemd configuration.

      If you want to list systemd services use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.
      To see services enabled on particular target use
      'systemctl list-dependencies [target]'.

test       0:off   1:off   2:off   3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off


Unfortunately, when the system reboots in runlevel 4, it did not start the
service automatically. I have to start the service test manually. How to
troubleshoot this ? Could someone help ?

Recently, a similar discussion transpired on the CentOS general

A couple of setups we have, the replication is almost real time (on
LAN) - the client transaction loads are light.

Ensure network connectivity is not the problem.

Strange, you cannot find forums / mailing lists for topics of interest.

1. Visit the web site of the topic (e.g. www.python.org).
2. Browse through the site.
3. Be assured you will find the support forums.
4. Follow the link(s), read the instructions to join the forum and
5. Voila -- you can participate.

Do not repeat questions that have been already asked.  Due diligence
requires reading the FAQs, and searching through the archives.
If you think your situation is unique, then cite the searched
documentations and tell how your situation is not solved yet.

Read the paragraph below ' Runlevels/targets' for using 'systemd' in
Runlevel 2, 4.

With any infrastructure there is CapEx and OpEx.

You have not mentioned what is the budget/thin client.

You can try AIO models to boot from a LTSP server or create your own
image that goes on a SATA Disk on Module (DoM).   This strategy also
works with desktop PCs already in the infrastructure.

You can try vxl model which we have configured as  voip client in ubuntu
for a contact center. You can call me for more details.

It is hard to predict what will catch on like a "forest fire" and what
will simmer down to ashes.

It is definitely an idea worth exploring as a business opportunity.

My team has implemented small infra solutions similar to this on AWS,
Digital Ocean, and Rackspace.

AWS already provides the infrastructure for the concept you have posted.
VMWare does the same for your own physical DC.

Your concern about data residing in foreign shores (under the foreign
jurisdiction) is valid *but* with most people who are now addicted to
social networking sites like FB, Tweeter, Whatsapp etc., their mind
set has also changed (IMO) vis-a-vis data privacy.

A few India based DC like Cntl-S may be the place to start your venture.

Hi,

I am using the slave connection using the internal LAN IP. Number of cpu
cores in slave is higher than master server.

List guidelines -- do *not* top post.

Look at number of transactions pending replication @ primary and
compare those number at the replica.

All the best for your idea!

As far as your idea is concerned, with minor changes it has been launched
by Zenith with the name Tiger Cloud and they sold to some customers also. I
do agree that your idea is different with the usage of SoC and Solar etc.,
But the problem with the Indian customers is (you can believe me as I have
met more than 1000+ CIO/CFO/CTOs who are not ready to accept a new idea but
will play a safe route of selecting already established players) - you can
try foreign countries and you will be more successful with other countries
than in India. I hope I will be wrong also :)

Most of the Indian DCs are using software to create a Private Cloud by
using OnApp or similar products so they look at being marketable than
encouraging a new concept.

One more thing is that this idea has been implemented almost 6 years back
by Sun.

http://www.datacentermap.com/blog/datacenter-container-55.html

In fact they used to ship the processing power just like the way we get
Generators for Power.

Anyway. all the best for your efforts.

IMO, if everyone thinks you have a great idea, its probably stale!
Corollary: if everyone thinks its BS, you are on the right track :-)

Whether the idea is BS or not, at worst you'll end up with learnings that
no IIM/Harvard can provide.

Best of luck,
mano

Hope you are using blogger after a very long time.
Google bought it.
goto http://blogger.com and login with your gmail login credentials.

Thanks for reminding about scribefire.
I used it heavily sometime back.

The new scribefire
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/scribefire-next/
is improved much.

Started to use it.

Oh, one more thing - stay away from "low" cost.  The market is crowded
with them.  The products mentioned in my previous post are very cost
competitive and beating them at their game will be a bit difficult
IMO.  Instead focus on high value and price your product accordingly.

First thing to consider in product development is the support
structure and how are you going to deploy bug/security fixes to the
installed base.

The India based products like Cyberoam, Gajshield, Quickheal etc.;
they import the hardware appliances in volumes, brand them with their
own labels and install a custom Linux image developed by them  **but**
they have a support structure (phone, email, web forums, firmware
updates etc.)

I don't how many people you have in your company.  IMO, even for a
company  with >10 technical people,  the above list is too much to
chew and digest.

Focus on one or two for production which should include a support
structure as mentioned above.

I am also working on a similar concept with a different approach.
Contact me if you are interested.

+1.

The focus need to be on creating value for the product than saying it
as 'low cost product' in the market.

ok. the meaning of low cost is the relative word comparative to the
proprietory solution such as cisco, juniper. we are not going to sell it to
5k which is meaningless. i never compromise on quality either hardware
selection or sw selection. the great adv is we dont have  software cost.
how to  bring down the product cost  is the challenge , the major coat
portion depends on hardware integreation cost and admin,support costs.  i
believe we can make entry level product at  Rs.15k+ for SME customer with
no compromise on quality and support.

I've done this is in the past. (2000-2002) and was part of a embedded Linux
district team. Built a device and a product. Used to convert old PCs into
gateways too.

Look up LEAF firewall. pFSense looks to be the best packaged version right
now for firewall. You must look at a gateway package and then choose the
platform. Eg one that supports firewall, proxy, AV, qos, 802.1x etc....

You'll find hardware with 5.to 8 Ethernet ports on a book PC from Taiwan or
even bare metal networking boxes, as is the trend now from Dell, HP etc.

You can write to me or talk to me if you want to discuss this further.

pc  may be higher.  i need to explore. if the cost is under control , then
thats the best fit.  i will contact you to discuss further on this topic.

Hi ,

The slave lag for a few seconds is common. It might be heavy writes on
master delaying the replication. As replication in MySQL is single threaded
it can happen ( Hope you are not using Multi threaded replication in MySQL
5.6 ).

What is the binglog format ?
Is the queries are tuned along with MySQL settings ?
Any notable queries in slow query log ?

KarthiK.P.R

Hi Karthik,

Thank you for your update.

My mysql server is running with old version 5.1 and it is hard to upgrade
at the moment.
