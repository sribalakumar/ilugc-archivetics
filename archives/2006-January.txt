Message-ID: <d2a92d610601010331q35303c78i@mail.gmail.com>

(X-posted)

Did anyone notice the leap second added today? My boxes handled this correctly:

Clock: inserting leap second 23:59:60 UTC

It would have happened at 5:30 AM on 1st Jan in India (midnight UTC).

The real question is applications. Do you have any application that
does something like:

if (second < 0 || second > 59) {
   fprintf (stderr, "Error!\n");
}

Then you do have a potential bug in the application.

If you have a tzdata package (or rather, /usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC file)
that was distributed after 4th July 2005 (my RHEL tzdata RPM was
updated on July 15th for the leap second), then your system probably
handled this correctly
(http://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulc/bulletinc.dat).

I skipped all the new year parties so that I could be in the
datacenter at 1AM (I am in CET, which is UTC+1h), to click a photo of
my NTS200 display when it shows 23:59:60. But alas! I clicked the
camera a second too soon, and all I got was the mundane everyday
23.59.59 :((

LFY, DELHI AND LINUX ASIA... SEEKING COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT:
LINUXForYou editor Rahul Chopra <rahul@efyindia.com> reminds us
of the forthcoming LinuxAsia event in Delhi. Rahul writes:

          This email is w.r.t. LinuxAsia, and to seek your help
          in building the community side to it.  LinuxAsia has
          managed to become the biggest B2B event, where top
          industry players meet customers at a national level. I
          am tempted to try and see if we can help drive the
          community push further in Delhi through LinuxAsia.

We have planned the following community initiatives for
LinuxAsia 2006:

* The Dot.Org mela where [free software and] open source
  projects will be provided a FREE booth space subject to
  registration and approval by the technical committee.

* The [GNU]Linux Newbie sessions where new comers sit through a
  one hour session, which is presented by the [GNU]Linux/[FL]OSS
  community takes them through a series of presentations, which
  would help the newbies to understand [free software and] open
  source and Linux better, and the benefits associated. We need
  good speakers who WANT TO TAKE LINUX TO THE MASSES, and can do
  a good job at that.

* Free LUG booths where we want more and more LUGs to be
  represented at Delhi to tell the world that India rocks when
  it comes to [GNU]Linux/[FL]OSS.

MORE ABOUT LINUX ASIA: You can submit your conference
proposal for LinuxAsia 2006 till January 8, 2006. Deadlines
for speakers as below:

* January 8, 2006: Proposal deadline
* January 15, 2006: Notification of acceptance to speakers
* January 22, 2006: Final presentation materials due
* February 8, 2006: LinuxAsia 2006 Conference begins

Submit your conference proposal at http://www.linuxasia.net/speakers

Jaromil (the creator of dyne:bolic, http://rastasoft.org/)

FSF-INDIA DIRECTOR Dr G Nagarjuna <nagarjun@gnowledge.org> of
the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education at the TIFR in
Mumbai, announces that the FSF is entering 2006 with a very
important task, drafting GPLv-3.

        GPLv-2 was released in 1991, and it is the most widely
        used free software license.  During the course of time,
        the computing environments are transforming,
        particularly with the entrance of webservices and
        embedded devices.  In the context of these changes, it
        is possible that user's freedom may not be preserved.

FSF says it is "committed to protect the software freedom even
under the transformed conditions in future." A draft of the
GPL-v3 will be released during the First International Public
GPL-v3 launch conference to be held at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) on January 16 and 17, 2006. Dr
Nagarjuna is expected to represent FSF India.

He writes: "I invite the  free software community in India to
actively participate in shaping the new license.  If you would
like to share any specific inputs let us discuss them here in
the list. You may also want to send me your thoughts directly.
Wishing you all a success in protecting software freedom."

NepaLinux IS OUT: It was released on December 22, 2005.
NepaLinux is a Debian and Morphix based GNU/Linux distribution
focused for Desktop usage in Nepali language computing. It
contains applications for Desktop users like: OpenOffice.org,
Nepali Gnome Desktop, Nepali input systems etc.

http://www.nepalinux.org/

It is drawing some early praise too. Our Greek friend Simos
Xenitellis <simos.lists@gmail.com> writes: "Congratulations to
everyone contributed in the work! I tried out the Live CD and I
must say I am really impressed with the level of integration and
completeness of localisation. You use a consistent colour theme
through out the LiveCD which means you went to great efforts to
update the icons/backgrouns/logos/etc. Also, every single
message in the menus was localised to Nepali; I had trouble to
navigate on the system :) I took some screenshots in PNG format

Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya (MPP) is the principal archive of
books and periodicals in the Nepali language, the mother tongue
(or lingua franca) of a little over 30 million people of South
Asia. It manages the largest archive in the Nepali language, and
supports the use of Nepali for the social, economic and cultural
advancement of all Nepali. Since January 2004, Madan Puraskar
Pustakalaya undertook the Nepal component of the 30-month long
PAN Localization Project (www.PANL10n.net), a multi-nation
localization project being conducted in Afghanistan, Bangladesh,
Bhutan, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, with the support
of International Development and Research Center (IDRC), Canada.
This project includes a Nepali GNU/Linux distribution
'NepaLinux' comprising of localized GNOME, OpenOffice.org,
Mozilla suite, and other utilities that include Nepali
Spellchecker, Thesaurus, Nepali Unicode support, etc. This
distribution can be used in Nepali as well in English
environment. Though NepaLinux is basically a live CD it can also
be installed in the computer. The work for the installation
process has been facilitated through the European Commission
supported Bhasha Sanchar Project -- http://www.bhashasanchar.org
-- which is led by the Open University (UK).

NepaLinux is a Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS), in
which the source code is open and the users have the freedom to
use, study, modify according to one's needs and redistribute it.
NepaLinux, being a Free/Open Source Software, does not charge
for its software unlike proprietary software, which cost a lot
and also do not allow the users to study, modify, or
redistribute.

Some of the packages included in NepaLinux are Linux Kernel
2.6.12, Gnome 2.10 Desktop Environment, OpenOffice.org 2.0, Gimp
Graphics Editor, IRC Client, Gaim Messenging Tool, Development
Tools (Includes C and C++), Mozilla Suite, GnomeBaker CD/DVD
Burning Utility, Firewall Security, Antivirus, Rootkit and
Sniffer Detection Tool, Image Viewers, Games, etc.

SEARCHING FOR A MEET VENUE? HOW ABOUT DOING IT ONLINE, VIA IRC?
This idea has been doing the rounds on LUGs, FSUGs and GLUGs
across India. It comes from Chennai-based software engineer
Shakthi Kannan <cyborg4k@yahoo.com> who moots having an
all-India online meet via IRC. Date: Jan 1, 2006. Time 1500 hrs
IST. Channel #gnu-india on irc.freenode.net

Sorry about the short (no?) notice from FN's side. But just
sharing this idea to be taken up in future. Shakthi says: "No
agenda as such. The idea is to get to meet folks from different
FSUGs/GLUGs, get to know what FSUGs/GLUGs have been and are
working on, free software ideas/suggestions/plans/activities for
2006." Useful concept. It was inspired, Shakthi says, after he
heard of Luggers in Mumbai discuss where the next meet be held.

AN EXPAT-HINDU PRIEST-DEBIAN GEEK'S VIEW: Jaldhar H. Vyas
<jaldhar@debian.org> who has the unusual combination of Hindu
priest and Debian geek, is based in the US, and part of La Salle
Debain - http://www.braincells.com/debian/

A great guy to meet with, this 34-year-old was in Bangalore
recently. On going back, Vyas reported that one of the problems
GNU/Linux users in countries like India face is low bandwidth.
Therefore, he argued, a distribution on CD or DVD is preferred
over large network installations or updates. He has found a
sponsor and is looking for a 1-DVD version of the Debian system.

He wrote to FN'sEyeOnGNULinux: "This is for distribution with
the Linux For You Magazine.  So 1 DVD is a must. However if you
want to also distribute DVDs I encourage you wholeheartedly. My
ultimate goal is that no one interested in Debian should be
prevented from trying it due to a lack of access."

CONVERGENCE OF MOVEMENTS TO FIGHT IPRs ON INFORMATION: GRAIN has
recently been taking an interest in what we have been calling
?convergence?: the ways in which people are resisting the push
for monopoly rights over information in different sectors. In
this time of unprecendented centralisation of power and control,
resistance is building on many fronts. We couldn?t help
wondering if our various struggles might be more effective if we
found some common ground. http://www.grain.org/convergence/

ONE COMMENT ON FLOSS AND EDUCATION: "Most distributions contain
simple games. But only a few contain programs that are really
good for use with young kids (see the following section). SuSE
Linux has probably the widest selection of games and educational
software. Mandrake is also fairly good, closely followed by
Debian. But Red Hat tends to be the worst of all the major
distributions as it concentrates on being a more technical Linux
system rather than a user-friendly desktop system. Of all the
distributions I've tried."

A friend from Redhat replies: "We are aware of this and are
working on alternatives. We are also working on trimming down
the OS so that it can run on older hardware."

PUBLIC-INTEREST LITIGATION AGAINST BANGALORE ONE: A PIL
against the Bangalore One project's alleged irregularities
has been admitted by the Karnataka High Court, according to a
post from the eGov INDIA <egovindia@yahoo.com> mailing list.
This Dec 17, 2005 post said what had been challenged was "the
legality of prescribing Microsoft technology which is
proprietary and costed when [Free/Libre and] Open Source
Software was available free. The MoU entered into between the
Government of Karnataka and Microsoft had been challenged in
the Writ Petition." See also:

FREE SOFTWARE ON THE SCREEN: V. Sasi Kumar
<sasi.fsf@gmail.com> explains how bridges are being built
between FLOSS and film-makers: "On December 15, we did a
short demonstration of Free Software related to media at the
International Film Festival of Kerala. We showed Blender,
Audacity, Kino, Adore, etc., although we could not really
demonstrate all features of the applications since we did not
have anyone who was experienced in using them. However,
Blender and Adore attracted some attention and a few
professionals talked to us after the demo. I understand that
a couple of other people collected our contact details from
the Kerala State Chalachitra Academy (organisers of the
Festival) later. We had put up a few posters at the major
venue (Kairali-Sree theatre complex) earlier. IFFK is
considered as one of the top ten Film Festivals in the world,
and we are happy that we could get an entry there. We hope to
plan and conduct similar demonstrations in the coming years.
A report on the demo with a couple of photographs will be put
up on our web page soon."

Subject: [Ilugc] bery cheap bluetooth dongle that works with Linux
Message-ID: <1136175705.18502.7.camel@localhost.localdomain>

hi everyone,
i bought an ngage yesterday..i want to know bout very cheap bluetooth
dongles (around 300-500..the china makes) that work well under
Linux..From the previous posts (way back in Oct)..i find that a CSR
Chipset USB Dongle works well..But how am i supposed to find out the
chipset in the first place when these dongles are sold in polythene
bags..I know that it is only the chipset in it that matters (i made me
50 rupees webcam work in Linux)
Also is there any other apps other than gnokii with more extensive
features?

regards and Happy New Year

Looks like you will be happy with just an nfs server on your 'mp3' box
and mounting that onto your 'non-mp3' box.

Subject: [Ilugc] NaughtySVN goes public
Message-ID: <1136213519.3045.141.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hello all,

My latest open source project called NaughtySVN (NSVN)
http://naughtysvn.tigris.org/ is now in the public domain. If anybody
interested in contributing to this project, please let me know. Now I am
working on the Alpha release and is expected in mid Jan 2006.

NaughtySVN is an easy-to-use Subversion GUI client which works as an
extension to Nautilus File Manager (Graphical shell for the GNOME
desktop environment). Inspired by TortoiseSVN, Its an effort primarily
for non-technical people to use subversion.

NSVN has a graphical interface which can be activated from Nautilus file
browsing window. Its graphical windows are designed to be simple and
easy to use, which  will allow users to create and administer subversion
repository, checkout and commit working copies, handling working copies,
browsing repositories and working copies, handling remote repositories
and working copies etc.

NSVN is written in C and makes use of GNOME Technologies, GTK/GDK,
Nautilus-Extension and glade for building its user-interface.


Regards

Dear Peers,

Just uploaded the DataOne bandwidth usage viewer called d1stat.
You can use this python application to find out your DataOne
broadband usage information.

The application displays the details of every session but what is more
interesting is it also prints your total traffic divided in to two ranges.

0200 --> 0008 hrs (Unaccounted period) and the rest of the day.

Now it is easy to find out how much of the bandwidth has been used
and also to make the best use of the unaccounted period.

Hope that this will be helpful to you. Here is the link to the download
page --> "http://www.vijairaj.5gigs.com/project/d1stat/"

A short note on its working:
The information is fetched from the DataOne accounting site as HTML
files. The files are then parsed to obtain the usage information, this is
then used to calculate the total traffic during the accounted hours
and unaccounted hours.

same as any other language - use the gettext module. Every string 
you want to translate needs _() put in - that is, suppose you 
wanted to translate the string "Save", you write it like so: 
_("Save") - then you collect all the strings in a pot file, 
translate them into tamil and compile a .mo file

Hi All,

I wish you all a very Happy New Year.

It has been a long time since I mailed on the list and it would be
appropriate to say that the transition from student to professional is
taking its toll  and I have lost the way with the source ;) More so the fact
that I have to work on M$ Technologies in my office.
But to be in touch with the ways of the source, I realize the need for a
reliable laptop. I have an option for buying a AMD Sempron Core 1.6 GHz Acer
Aspire 1360 with 512 MBDDR and the works, which are enough for me.

I would like to know whether there would be any known compatibility issues
with this laptop in Linux and whether it would give a decent performance in
terms of GUI and stability. And also the heat generation issues of AMD
though it is said to be an old story now.

Please send me personal replies and let me know your opinions.

In this new year, I hope the source is with all of us. And I get back my way
with it ;)

I do have such a laptop... Acer Aspire 3002NLC... Have been usin
Debian testign without any problems... There seemed to be an error in
the ACPI DSDT tables, which can be fixed by using the "Use Custom
DSDT" option of the kernel and providing a fixed DSDT. I haven't
tested the modem as yet. Haven't had problems with the processor
overheating, though your laptop feels a bit too warm much of the time
:) (Normally hovers around 60C for me...Seen it go upto 75C under
prolonged intensive computation...but no problems because of it, and I
do use my laptop quite a lot). The real problem is the battery life...
45 mins is the maximum I have got out of it, even with all power
saving tweaks of laptop-mode on. And yes, one more problem is that the
SiS M70GX graphics card doesn't have DRI support as yet... and uses
shared memory... the developer of SiS drivers for X advises against
buying this chip for this reason. I don't play many games, and I
haven't had any performance problems with the GUI and playing movies.
See http://www.winischhofer.net/ for more information.

Hmm... that's it afaicr... Will add to this if I remember anything else...

it moves on...

How is the Sempron Core in performance compared to the Celeron (old ones as

Respected Sir / Madam,

I am writing this message to seek help regarding an initiative for the true
and total empowerment of vernacular medium students in India in the field of
Information Technology. This relates to the development of vernacular free
open source OS (DOS in Hindi, Bangla, Gujrati etc.) and programming languages
(C, C++, lex, yacc, assembly, Java, Prolog etc. in Hindi, Bangla, Gujrati
etc.). This is the first time ever that such software has been successfully
developed, even though there have been many research groups working on it for
decades now. What is more important is that all this software has been
released as 'free' for the benefit of the vernacular medium students. I have
no financial interests from it. I have attached the original announcement
with this message, along with another message discussing some important
topics regarding feasibility issues concerning such effort.

The kind of support I expect may be in any form (coding, awareness,
sponsorship, advertisements etc.). There is one specific manner in which one
can contribute greatly, with or without involving me as outlined below.
1) Adopt the vernacular IT initiative for a school or college in one's own
hometown.
2) Arrange for a few computers (even old second hand one's can support the
software I have developed, so you may donate old ones). This software "does
not" require any add on hardware or commercial software for supporting Indian
vernacular display, OS and programming languages. You will have to contact the
school or some concerned organisation for the actual transfer.

As about me, I am a 24 yrs old IT professional and the winner of the Computer
Society of India's Eastern Regional Young IT Professional Award 2005 (national
rounds are yet to be held, but I'm sure I'll win.) You can view my CV at

I would finally like to apologise if you find this email unsolicited, and
thank you for reading this far. This has been sent to you individually and
your name has not been included in any mailing list. This is the only mail
you shall receive, unless you wish to further communicate regarding this
matter.

======== Mail announcing the availability of FOSS system software in
vernaculars (Hindi/Bangla C, C++, assembly, BASIC, LOGO etc.) ==========

Respected Sir/Madam,

This is to inform you of the availability of the first ever "complete" suite
of open-source programming languages for Indian vernaculars. It includes
equivalents of C, C++, lex, yacc, assembly, Java etc. in Hindi, Bangla and
other vernaculars. Along with this I have also released Hindi and Bangla DOS,
including BASIC and Logo for vernaculars. The downloads are available at
http://www.indicybers.com

These projects have won Computer Society of India's Young IT Professional
Award (Eastern region) 2005 (Winner) and 2004 (Special mention), two years in
a row. I shall be competing at the 2005 national level now.

Some of the innovations of this project include a system for displaying Indic
scripts in "true" text-mode. This is done without using any aditional
hardware. At no point has any graphical (rasterising) method been used for
this. All the required glyphs have been accomodated in the extended ASCII
code page, leaving 7-bit ASCII unaltered. This method is applicable to all
Brahmi derived composite syllabic Indian scripts. Hindi, Bangla, Assamese and
Gujrati scripts have been implemented. Oriya and Punjabi are under
development. There are strong suggestions that this may be applicable for
South Indian scripts as well. This has made it possible to have BIOS/POST in
Indic. Besides, this system being free, it does not add to the procurement
cost as compared to commercial products.

Another contribution of this project includes a "case and diacritic
independent, compiler acceptable" transliteration system. This is completely
invertible and is applicable to all Indian languages. This has direct mapping
to the IPA and, hence, may be used to develop programming languages in "any"
human language. It also has bearings on web technology,  as it can allow
Indic URLs in IPv4 as well. It may be used to encode even static web-pages,
such that if someone does not have the required fonts then one may see the
Indic web-page in Roman script transliteration, instead of "boxes" (unicode)
or garbage (other encodings), from the same "static" html.

Finally, the task of Indic programming language design has not been trivial
either. I have also included support for HP printers. The system uses GCC as
back-end and is highly portable. There is both ISCII and UNICODE support for
all languages, including Hindi/Bangla DOS and the IDE. Necessary filters have
been provided for conversions between ISCII, Romenagri, UNICODE, APCISR,
HP-PCL etc. The languages have been developed synchronically and, hence,
there is a certain level of homogenity in keyword selection across paradigms.
The programs written in Indic programming languages are readily converted to
their English equivalents and hence may be delivered internationally. There
is also support for translation of variable names and rudimentary literate
programming. Unreleased languages include Lisp, Prolog, Ada, Pascal, Fortran
etc. in Inian vernaculars. They shall be released soon, after the initial
testing and verification of license issues. However the availability of lex
and yacc makes the issues of targeting specific lanuages quite trivial, and
these are already available for download along with C, C++, assembly, BASIC,
logo, and Java in Hindi and Bangla.

Technologically, Hindi/Bangla C/C++/assembly has been used for robotics and
cluster super-computers. Along with this system, I have also released in
public domain the design of a natural-interfaced autonomous robot. The
languages have also been used to successfully implement a Beowulf cluster.
Effort is now being made towards porting Linux kernel sources to Hindi/Bangla
C, asm etc. This is aided by the fact that I have also include
English-programming-language to Hindi/Bangla-programming-language translators
and vice-versa.

Sir/Madam, I have released all this software as free open source for the
greater benefit of the vernacular literate population of our country. I do
not have any financial interests from it. However, I shall appreciate support
in any form (including coding, awareness, maintainance, and financial). I am
also looking for a suitable job. My experience includes systems programming
(compiler design, device drivers, Linux kernel), computational linguistics,
embedded systems, C/C++/assembly/Java, medical-informatics, artificial
intelligence, and technical writing.

================ Mail discussing important topics ======================

Hello everyone,

Thank you for your interest regarding vernacular programming languages. I
would like to begin this discussion with a few very valid points raised by
Vivek as they provided a good basis for starting a conversation, and along
these lines I shall also reflect upon some of my short and long term
objectives. The latter, though, deserve a seperate discussion and I would
request you to refer to the documents http://indicybers.com/vision2020.html
and http://indicybers.com/swatantra.html



Topic 1 : Bridging the gap beetween vernacular and English developers

Vivek wrote:

>between two things.  The already ready english based programming 
>community and the possibly new and developing vernacular developers. 
>This gap might again be challenge to bridge.

Point-> Hindawi(Hindi/Bangla C, C++ etc.) does 'not' create any further
divide or gap between vernacular developers and traditional (English)
developers. Hindi / Bangla C, C++, Java, assembly etc. get 'readily'
translated into their English equivalent. There is also provision for
translation of variable names, which certainly is not a trivial task and
formed the basis of my interaction with Swami Sarvottamanand, Dean of
Research and HOD Comp. Sci. at Belur Math college, who was one of the
distinguished judges during the YIPTA event. The reverse, that is,
translation of English programming languages and variable names to vernacular
programming languages and variable names also takes place 'readily'; (here
readily implies without any extra programming effort). So there isn't any new
gap that develops between traditional and vernacular developers; only the old
ones are bridged. I am working on a system for complete machine translation
of documentation as well (a limited scale version should be ready in a month
or two.)

Explanation-> This has been a very basic consideration during the course of
development of Hindawi. This also relates to another concern - that of the
utility of vernacular programming languages. Vernacular BASIC and LOGO are
fine as paedagogical aids (teaching tools), supposed to be used in the
classroom setting or by hobby programmers, (though I must point out that
Hindi/Bangla BASIC allows EXE files to be created and C code to be embedded).
However, the moment one talks of vernacular C, C++ , lex, yacc or say
vernacular Java, one has to consider the fact that learning these languages
shall involve a substantial effort. Though it is comparatively simpler for a
vernacular literate person than learning their English manifestations. This
shall prove meaningless if the skills acquired cannot be used professionally,
that is, if they are not marketable enough. And "enough" certainly would
include international markets. As metioned earlier, the ready conversion of
programs written in vernacular languages to their English counterparts, and
vice-versa, solves this problem. For instance, let us consider a possible
scenario set in the not-so-distant future.

	We are in a 2012AD (six years from now), the first mile-stone year in
achieving the target of making India an ICT superpower. (By then I'm sure ICT
shall stand for Indian Cottage Technology, for indeed, that is what I envision
- to make Information and Communication Technology a literal 'cottage'
industry in India which shall cater solutions globally, and provide at least
some major relief to the unemployment situation. That would be akin to the
electronics industry in China today.) A person, say, in the USA needs a piece
of software for his new startup. He logs onto the Indian "Software Exchange"
(***a new social concept***) website, posts his requirement in the standard
format available there, and pays the prescribed fees online (say an advance,
with balance to be cleared as and when the final settlements are done). This
requirements' document is in a restricted-grammar format and can be
translated into a vernacular even with 2005 technology. The vernacular
requirements' document is then provided to a vernacular developer as per
turn, who may accept or refuse the task; in the latter case, it is handed
over to the next developer in queue. The vernacular developer then proceeds
with the standard software engineering steps of analysis, coding, testing,
etc. He certainly codes in vernacular programming languages and also does the
analysis and testing in vernacular. Where input from the end user is needed in
the development process, the developer provides the English source code, which
as I have pointed out is readily generated by the Hindawi compiler system
(which by then shall certainly have improved a lot). As about the English
text messages contained in the program; they are converted back into English
by the translation process at the Software Exchange. (*** Machine translation
is the piece of technology I am focussing my development efforts on now, but
for restricted-grammar this has been achieved ***.) The end product is
finally provided to the person in the USA, with complete source, variable
names, documentation etc. in English. Further work may be handled by either a
traditional (English) or vernacular developer. As an aside, I have only
skimmed through the description of this scenario. I already have worked on
aspects such as what changes to the currently practised software metrics may
be needed. Besides, a few new postions may need to be created, and this
person-centric scenario should be viewed as a team-centric one.

Summary-> There can be complete synergy between vernacular and traditional
(English) deveoper communities.



Topic 2: Making source code available online and project management site

Vivek wrote:

>developer.berlios.de, gforge to name a few.

It seems you have tried the demo version. The source code, certainly, is
available online and was also carried on CHIP Sept 2005 CD (which carried
Hindawi Release 1, current version is Release2). It is included along with
the binary distribution (complete package - 40MB and not in the demo or DOS
floppy). Seperate distribution for source and binary is desirable, however,
many parts of Hindawi are written in Hindawi itself (bootstrapped) and this
makes it a more involved task as it would be necessary to provide information
regarding which file goes where and does what, and an explanation for the code
itself; but again the Hindi/Bangla sources are converted to English
equivalent, hence this is not a problem. I shall make the sources available
seperately soon. (*** Support needed ***) You may download the following file
and install Hindawi from it for the complete distribution. (Installation
instructions are given later in this mail.)
http://www.indicybers.com/HindawiR2CD.zip

As about an online project management site (sourceforge etc.). This is a very
important point, and I am considering the viable options (***Support
needed***). The plans have been there since the inception of the project, but
there have been delays. Personal obligations have further contributed to the
delay, but I have tried to keep Hindawi as much on the pre-detremined
schedule as possible. Considering the fact that, technologically, the project
is complete, it is only the lack of community involvement that is keeping it
down, and yes a portal for Hindawi on sourceforge, savannah.gnu etc. is
urgently needed.  (***Support needed***)



Topic 3: Community involvement

Vivek wrote
>secondly, have been able to bring in any kind of developers( hobby, part 
>time) to be involved in this process?

This is my primary objective today. Hindawi has already reached a point where
I'm finding it difficult to manage the project alone. As new languages and
technologies are added, the project will require more and more community
involvement. The immediate requirement is for documentation (***Support
needed***). Lack of proper documentation is proving to be a bit of hindrance.
For instance, many people have complained that Hindawi does not start up on
their computers. This is mainly because of poor documentation in Release 1,
which has been improved in Release 2. Further, every system needs to evolve
and that is the very essence of an open-source system. This requires more
developers to join in. At the recently concluded Infocom 2005, Hindawi was
sponsored by the National Council of Science Museums under a technology
scholarship scheme (the greatest 'de-facto' financial help recieved by
Hindawi/BangaBhasha till date). This has provided Hindawi with a wonderful
platform and many people have expressed their intent to collaborate. However,
proper collaboration would intially require me to devote considerable time,
and I have been busy with some unavoidable engagements recently (including
searching for a somewhat decent job, which I'm yet to find) (***Support

explaining the internals of Hindawi. But again financial constraints are the
major hurdle. I would really appreciate some suggestion regarding this matter
(***Support needed***).



Topic 4: Problems in startup

This stems from the fact that one normally expects Hindawi to be a GUI based
application, but one of the technological achievements of Hindawi has been
the ability to display Indic scripts in text-mode, without using any
commercial soulution such as GIST card. The feature of Hindawi which allows
it to display Indic scripts in text mode, also necessitates that it be
started in text mode. In Release1 one had to switch to text mode manually (by
pressing Alt-Enter in a DOS box, or booting up in DOS), 'before' starting
Hindawi. Even the TDIL people had problems regarding this, because they were
switching to text-mode 'after' starting Hindawi. This has been done away with
in Release 2. Now running Hindawi.bat automatically switches to text-mode.
(The exact details of running Hindawi is given later. Users may still be
required to press Alt-Enter if Hindawi starts up in a window instead of
full-screen, but the sequence is inconsequential.) I considered the option of
having a seperate GUI based based interface for Hindawi, but at the current
status of the project too many different interface implementations would
Hinder the pace of technologial development. A GUI based interface (like
Dev-C++ for MinGW) is highly desirable, and I shall devote some time to it
soon. Possibly after the national rounds of the Young IT Prof award.

> Your contribution to free software looks amazing.

Thank you for the appreciation. I hope you will be able to install and try
out Hindawi/BangaBhasha with the following instructions. I shall be posting
more detailed instructions on the Hindawi group page
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hindawi

A) For Hindawi / BangaBhasha (suite of programming languages)
1) Download the necessary zip files from http://indicybers.com For Hindi
http://www.indicybers.com/HindawiR2CD.zip For Bangla
http://www.indicybers.com/BangaBhashaR1CD.zip
2) Unzip the files to a directory on your computer
3) The package has technical write-up's as PDF files and a voice narrated
presentation (PPT) file
4) Go to DOS prompt or DOS box under Windows and switch to the directory
where you unzipped the downloaded zip file
5) Run setup.exe
6) Follow on screen instructions (in English and vernaculars)
7) I would suggest you accept the default locations, unless you have some
constraints. The total installed foot-print is around 50 MB
8) Setup creates a batch file "hindawi.bat" with the necessary startup script
to set up the required environment variables.
9) After installation is completed, start Hindawi by running "hindawi.bat"
from the directory of installation. If Hindawi opens up in a window, which it
normally should not, press Alt-Enter to switch to full screen mode
10) This will take you to Aadesh -  the Hindi command shell.
11) To type in Hindi /Bangla turn Scroll lok on (this is indicated on the low
right hand corner of the screen)
12) Hindawi uses INSCRIPT keyboard layout. JPEG file is available online
http://www.indicybers.com/devanagari.jpg
http://www.indicybers.com/bangla.jpg
13) To start the IDE type "Lekhak" in English or vernacular
14) Once lekhak has started up, you are taken to the welcome page of the
online help system
15) To close the help-box press Esc
16) To activate a menu press Alt+Red_lettered_key or use a function key
shortcut 
17) Press F3 to open the load file dialog
18) Press Tab to go to the file-list section
19) Navigate down with the arrow keys till "samples/" is highlighted and
press enter.
20) Similarly select the directory for the language for which you wish to see
a program (later you may try writing your own vernacular programs)
robot - logo
prathmik - BASIC
guru - C
shraeni - C++
shabda - lex
vyaaka - yacc
kritrim - Java
yantrik - x86 assembly
21) Load the vernacular named files by highlighting their names as above and
pressing Enter
22) Follow the following shortcuts to compile and run
F5 - Compile + execute
F6 - execute a previously compiled program (only in hindi)
F7 - prepare a compiled program for deployment
F9 - compile only
NB: Please navigate down the source files by pressing PageDown as there is a
lot of copyright information in the beginning of each
23) To exit lekhak press Alt-X or choose nikaas(exit) from khaata(file) menu
24) To exit Aadesh type exit or nikaas(in vernaular)

B) For Bangla / Hindi DOS
i) Download and unzip the Hindi/Bangla DOS zip file
http://www.indicybers.com/HINDIDOS.ZIP or
http://www.indicybers.com/BANG_DOS.ZIP
ii) Run mkdisk.bat from the DOS prompt (DOS box under Windows)
iii) Follow on-screen prompts (in English) to create a boot disk for Hindi /
Bangla DOS
iv) Boot up your computer with this.
v) The DOS disk has the necessary files for hard-disk installation, but you
must be familiar with fdisk etc. Hindi/Bangla DOS setup is not yet ready.

Sir, I am looking for support in terms of financial grants, besides
developers who would like to join into the effort. A lot of support is
required in terms of awareness generation.I would appreciate any form of
financial support such as financial grant, fellowship, sponsorship,
advertisements, co-branding offers, CD distribution offers, book publication
offers etc.  (Personally I am also in the urgent need of a suitable job, and
would appreciate any referrals coming my way.)

=========== A Bangla specific mail but it applies to all other vernaculars
==================
Hello friends,

Let us think of our brothers and sisters who have not been priviledged enough
to go to English medium schools. Even they have a right to benefit from the
ICT (Information and Communication Technology) revolution. Software is
certainly being written for them, but I would liken that to a Mercedes car
without a steering wheel. What I mean is that the Bangla software available
today is of wonderful quality, like a Mercedes in the world of automobiles,
but it only allows a user to perform a predetermined function, hence no
streeing wheel. Say the user wants to do something of his own desire, how
does he do it? Is DTP the only access we want to provide our vernacular
literate brothers and sisters with?

Hae Banga bhandaarae taba bibhida ratan,
Ta sabe (abodh aami) abahela kori!!

The answer lies in providing them with a programming language in the mother
tongue. Yes, and that too, one in which even the highest of technical
programs may be written, besides of course the simple ones. BangaBhasha is
just that. It offers Bangla LOGO and BanglaBASIC for the children and
beginners, and Bangla C, Bangla C++, Bangla assembly, Bangla lex, Bangla
yacc, Bangla Java etc. for the advanced and professionally inclined. With
this they can do any kind of programming, including even robotics and super
computing. This software does not require any special hardware, and can also
run on an old Pentium I or PII.

Friends, help us reach it to the people who need it. You need not pay us
anything for this, yes it is truly free. If you know a Bangla medium school,
which you certainly do, tell them about it. If you have an old machine donate
it to some school, college or social group where it can be used to teach
Bangla programming languages. You may even teach someone Bangla programming
yourself.

You may download Bangla DOS, Bangla C, Bangla C++, Bangla BASIC, Bangla
assembly, Bangla lex, Bangla yacc and many other systems tools in Bangla from
http://www.indicybers.com/ben_index.html or from the page
http://www.indicybers.com

If you are concerned about how good it really is, then may I humbly inform
you that it has won the Young IT Professional Award (E) 2005 from Computer
Society of India.

Please remember "Matribhasha rupi khoni, purna mani jaale"!

Dear All,

Wish you a happy and prosperous new year on the eve of my first visit to this group.
I have worked on some few linux based flash media & camera drivers.

Now I have plans for writing a driver for USB devices.
I am planning to write driver for USB finger print scanner. 
I driver responsibility is to just read continuously and provide it to the Application. No algorithm impl needed, it is all impl'd in HARDWARE.

Right now I am looking into Orelly 3rd Edition book as reference.
Can someone point out how I can go ahead knowing the USB 2.0 architecture as well as 2.6 kernels USB Architecture docs that can help me out?
Any example driver would help.

Any comments and suggestions are welcome.

Regards,
Mukund Jampala

Nice. What hardware/platform?

Since, you are dealing close to application, you will
need to send/receive data from the host controller
driver (EHCI, for such high-bandwidth use).

Saves your time and effort.

Yes. Read Chapter 13. Also check these for a start:

http://www.lrr.in.tum.de/Par/arch/usb/usbdoc/

http://www.linuxtecharticles.com/basiclinuxusbdrivers.html

> Can someone point out how I can go ahead knowing the

IMO, USB 2.0 is a very complicated architecture. To
the end-user it is quite simple to use though.

> as well as 2.6 kernels USB
> Architecture docs that can help me out?

The code has been organized neatly in 2.6. Most of the
USB implementation is handled in usbcore module.

it is claimed that sempron performs much better than celeron... dunno
how true those claims are... as i haven't used a celeron myself... but
celeron has very less L1 cache, which makes it obviously
disadvantaged... if power is not a problem, i would recommend
sempron...

Greetings!

I would like your "useful" views on web publishing
with GNU/Linux. 

CMS is great, but, when you really want to customize
it for your needs, you will have to get into the code
with php, mysql and stuff.  For a beginner, it does
involve quite some man-hours and a learning curve?

As we upgrade further, we really have to be concerned
with the different software versions and their
development etc. Ruby on Rails also requires you to
have Apache and co. Same in the case of Zope. Yes,
Apache is prominent in the web server market.

Or, is it better to use html, css, xhtml.

I believe it comes down to whether you want to have
flat-files or relational databases? What are your
thoughts?

Thanks,

SK

hi,
       Is there any multithreaded download manager for GNU/Linux?

I tried aget, but it doesn't support proxy. Then gftp is said to be
multithreaded, but when i tried it there was no improvement in
performance (I can't say how many threads it was using, but the time
of download didn't decrease). The maximum download speed it could
reach was around 2.5 KB/s

For curl I found the following script:
http://cool.haxx.se/cvs.cgi/curl-perl/examples/multi-threaded.pl?rev=1.1&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup

I don't know even a bit of Perl. But I tried changing the $url to the
file I want to download. I got the following error:

Can't locate WWW/Curl/Easy.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /etc/perl
/usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.4 /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.4 /usr/lib/perl5

It is multithreaded. U can feel the difference if u try dnlding the
same file with ftp and with gftp.

get http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/C/CR/CRISB/WWW-Curl-3.02.tar.gz
and after deflating it, put the Curl subdirectory somewhere in it to
wherever ur /usr/share/perl/5.8.4/WWW/ or equivalent place (As the
case in urs may be. Wherever WWW libs are there).

the key question is who is doing the publishing. End user who just 
wants to put up a site with the least of problems or a developer 
who is building sites for endusers to administer?

Actually for both, the answer is the same. There is a convergence of 
views which works out to - a rdbms, a webserver, a scripting 
language, javascript and ajax. This mix brings web publishing 
almost on par with the desktop - in fact the desktop will soon be 
obsolete.

Secondly, frameworks seem to be the way to go. The two hottest 
contenders out there appear to be RubyOnRails using ruby and django 
using python. Java use seems to be declining.

Zope/Plone is another hot contender.

There are a lot of php/mysql applications around, but security is a 
serious concern as php puts executable code under document root 
among other things.

The big advantage of using scripting languages like python and ruby 
is that even laymen can pick up enough of the language to do some 
of their own modifications and customisation. Also rapid 
prototypeing is available and no need to worry about memory 
management.

As for databases - postgresql is the way to go for heavy stuff with 
sqllite for lighter stuff. 

Webservers - apache rules

Thanks for all your responses. I will try them out. One more query,
many files are available on multiple mirrors. Is there some way we can
exploit this to download different parts of the file from different
mirrors?

Hi!

We are getting the following error message when we try
to add the ftp installation  source in YAST. 

unable to create installation source from URL
'ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/x86_64/10.0'

Deatils:

We did the following: 

Protocol: FTP
Servername: ftp.suse.com
Directory on Server: pub/suse/x86_64/10.0

We face this problem only with Suse 64 bit. The
interesting fact is the YAST is considering the same
ftp server and same directory pub/suse/x86_64 for
online updates and it is able to perform them without
any problem. We are facing the same problem with Suse
9.3 and Suse 10.

I am developing python scripts for site management in www.24dot1.com. The
source will be in markdown syntax. It generates the HTML files htdocs (or
public_html) directory. Should be simple for most (excluding blog use case)

For people, developing there own dynamic site management, I would like them
to look at webpy.org. It runs behind apache as cgi and fcgi. For development
it runs as SimpleHTTPServer wsgi app. Great for simple websites.

For sophisticated web development, try Twisted -
http://www.twistedmatrix.com and Nevow - http://divmod.org/trac/

For languages other than Python, whatever floats your boat ....

Subject: [Ilugc] Job scheduler in FC1 doesnt wrk, the "at"  problem
Message-ID: <20060106141411.23513.qmail@webmail9.rediffmail.com>

 ?
Hi all,
        I am facing an issue scheduling a job in linux (Fedora Core 1). I wish to use the "at" command to start a job at a specified time (actually,i have Dataone broadband connection. I want to start a download at 2:00AM,as dataone provides free unlimited download between 2 to 8). I did the following

''''''''''konsole''''''''''''''''''''

[user@localhost Apps]$ at 2:30
at> execute
at> <EOT>
job 27 at 2006-01-07 02:30
[user@localhost Apps]$

''''''''''konsole''''''''''''''''''''

--> here "execute" is a shell script


The following are the contents of my shell script "execute"

'''''''''''''Shell script''''''''''''''''''''
#! /bin/bash
/home/user/Apps/BitTornado/btdownloadheadless.py /home/user/Apps/BitTornado/mytorrent.torrent --saveas /mnt/e/linux/torrent_downloads/mytorrent 1>> /dev/null 2>> /dev/null
'''''''''''''Shell script''''''''''''''''''''

But the job is not starting at 2:00 AM. In fact,the "at" command simply does not work. It accepts the job i specify, assigns a job ID to it, but simply refuses to start the job at the given time.

I tried the following
---------------------

1. tried using "at" command as a root user,still it doesnt work

2. I tried chking the "at" command as follows

''''''''''konsole''''''''''''''''''''

[user@localhost Apps]$ at now
at> execute
at> <EOT>
job 27 at 2006-01-06 19:30
[user@localhost Apps]$

''''''''''konsole''''''''''''''''''''

  But still the job does not run

3.I checked the "at" queue using the "atq". It displays the pending job as 
         27      2006-01-07 02:30 a user
but once the shceduled time elapses, the "at" queue no longer displays the job. But job does not start

4. I tried googling, but couldnt find any solid clue as to what could cause this.

5. But i did come accross a link which said, the "at" command uses two files in the /etc folder, namely, at.allow and at.deny. I checked the /etc folder, the at.allow does not exists but at.deny exists and is empty

Am i missing something ????

Kindly help me resolve this problem. Thanks in advance for your help

warm regards

Hello,

Yes. CMS is great. I am now meddling around with Joomla. But I am not able 
to customize to what exactly I need. Also one more is that, if I wnt to 
workaround I need a pretty good knowledge of Apache, PHP which I am really 
having a nice time with :).. Due to my plans of Launching my website 
www.tuxmaniac.com I am undergoing the learning curve myself now and 
experimenting with all kinds of possibilities.

I dunno much abt Ruby.. So will not be able to comment on it.

I would like to know whether something like this is possible. A software 
package with a CMS , DB package and a Server/Scripting Language all made 
available as a single package which when put on the server the site starts 
working out of the box. And one more thing I wanna know is that currently is 
there version conflicts within LAMP.. I mean If I use Joomla latest version 
and Apache httpd say 1.6 and some new version of PHP will there be any 
Conflict or malfunctioning of the system??

Put in your views to the above also..


Regards,
Aanjhan

Hi
 
  I found the reason as to y at was not starting my program. The shell script,rather Bittornado was the culprit.
I was invoking btdownloadheadless.py using "at" command, now btdownloadheadless.py reports error saying 

"Error opening terminal:unknown."

Looks like btdownloadheadless.py is importing curses. When i commented out this import, the job got invoked at the scheduled time. For more information refer the following link.

Kindly Let me know your comments on the below options of doing it:

1. Put it in Flickr and link it to the home page.

2. USe Gallery packages like rsGallery or akoGallery [Both are Alpha

Limited to 3 sets (albums) for free account. However, you can come up with
hacks that let you create albums in your site, but linking to original
flickr photos. Sounds like a nice project.

You pay for the ever growing disk space (and bandwidth).

I keep photos in my computer only, publishing some of them online (flickr)
if required.


Hey, purists! an elisp photo management would be uber cool! :-)

Gallery2 - joomla or mambo is good combination

I'd recommend Gallery. Easy to setup and use,
especially when you have hundreds of photos.

Hi
I too would swear by gallery. It's really easy to setup and goes on fine
with almost any CMS. I use it with Nucleus:CMS. Check out my page

Even though it's kind of OT, here are my suggestions. If you are
looking for linux based hosting, i recommend you to go for
www.symonds.net. They provide good service at a reasonable cost. They
provide 24/7 support, not just in papers. I've registered & hosted
8-10 domains with them and i'm satisfied.

In this regard, you can contact Mark Symonds, mark@symonds.net.

I'd recommend the o/p to avoid webcom. I have a domain registered with
them, for which I paid quite a lot of money for a 10-year renewal.
Initially they renewed only for one year, but after -much- coaxing,
they increased it to six years. They still are sitting on my money for
four years' worth of renewal, and emails to them go unanswered. I am
at the moment of the opinion that they have cheated me.

> Webcomindia is delhi based company, they are doing well, anyone can

There might be several, but given the kind of professionalism I have
seen at webcom, I'd tell the o/p to look abroad for his hosting.
Symonds - as someone suggested - is a really good option. Several
people here know Mark Symonds personally.

If you are putting up a commercial site, it might be better to go with
someone established like Yahoo or Rediff. Pricier, but safer.

avoid rediff at all costs - they force you to host with them also - 
they have a control panel which claims to be able to change the dns 
servers, but it is disabled. I had to issue a legal notice to them 
to rescue a client of mine

Do you desperately want to know which Linux distribution suits your
need? take the following test. Its not fool proof but will give you
some idea. If you tried please share your experience. I got suggested
to use Debian (or) Ubuntu (which I'm using now!!!).

If your site is for personal use, I would suggest NOT to go with those hefty
web hosting (100gb/month bandwidth, ....) companies. You would always end up
using much less than 1gb/month initially. In that way, I chose
NearlyFreeSpeech.Net. Period. It is much much better than symonds. Follow my
path, if you want to spend less than $1 per month.

Hi KaruppuSwamy,
Your frustration is very much valid. I am also one of the frustrated
tamil linux user due to lack of anjal keyboard.
There is one SCIM package for Anjal but still it needs some packaging
so that ordinary users like us can install it in a single click. Some
of my friends in thamizhadeveloper yahoo group are working on it.

On the otherhand , I am now working on a firefox extension for tamil
keyboard ( tamilkey.mozdev.org  - site is not yet ready ) with Anjal
support. I hope to release a beta version for this Pongal day.

I have also put a javascript based html page for typing tamil ( can be
used from Windows/Linux ) here:

http://developer.thamizha.com/tamilkey.html

Its working in firefox but its not working from IE, i dont know the
reason, can anybody help me to make this page work in IE too..

Regards,
Mugunth

I use TAB (Tamil and Bilingual?) key mapping on Debian
GNU/Linux, with TAMKamban font (and others) on
Abiword. Works great! The best part is I can simply
export my tamil writings to .html and can publish it
in tamil online.

Debian Sarge 3.1r0a has the Tascii, TAB, and Unicode
keyboard mappings. Since, I learnt tamil typewriting
during the early days using a tamil typewriter :), I
prefer to use the TAB key layout.

Just my thoughts,

SK

Though I have not bought anything recently, using a internal HDD and a
separate external casing might work out cheaper.

A month back, a friend of mine bought a Segate 80 Gb HDD for Rs. 2400,
and a IDE to USB adaptor (with casing) for Rs 700 from Ritchie St. The
combined price was almost same in all the shops, with a variation of
+/- 50 Rs. Installing the HDD within the casing was pretty easy. But
data transfer rate would be pretty slow (ofcourse!). AFAIR, formatting
the HDD through the USB interface itself took around 45 mins or so!

At the higher end, there was Maxtor and Segate Harddisks with USB 2.0
and Firewire interface. Looks pretty attractive, good finishing - but
costs more - I believe it was a 60 Gb HDD for around Rs. 5-6000.

Would recommend buying a HDD and an IDE to USB adaptor. The adaptor
would look somewhat like this:

hi all,

i just bought Maxtor 100GB External USB HDD which costed me Rs.5200. Linux
detects it just as a normal pen drive and there are no issues at all.

I have a debian system with 2.6.12 kernel.I have downloaded Gcc4.0.2 from
gnu.org and have compiled it from source.After installing it on my system i
still see that gcc3.3.6 is being used as default.

When i issue this command i see


rohit# gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 3.3.6 (Debian 1:3.3.6-7)

What am i missing, do i have to any kind of linking libraries etc..

Compiling GCC from source is not straight forward in first place.  The
recommended way is to build in a separate parallel object dir.

BTW, if you have configured GCC, but forgot to mention
"--prefix=/usr", the objects would be installed under /usr/local.

So, adjust your PATH to use the newly built GCC, like:

shelll> export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

This way is better since you don't mess the system default in /usr.

if you would have used a tar..

#which gcc

will tell you what location of your "gcc" like
/usr/bin/gcc

may be your new "gcc" is hiding somewhere in /use/local/bin/

change your bash_profile

export PATH=/<path of bin>/:$PATH

Hi all, 

I am trying to use softphone like "linphone" with FC 2 to call any phone..

At the moment, I am looking out for any Indian softphone suscribers who gives support for linux..
I am not finding any and all of what I have found like "Vebtel" has support for windows softphone ..

Let me know if there are linux support suscribers other than www.voipuser.org, www.freeuserdialup.com

Instead, I would set and use CC, CXX accordingly for compiling programs.

If I want to compile using the new GCC toolchain, I would use

shell> export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++

Most programs respect these variables.

Sorry Bharathi! My Thundebird is in Text format only. It was happened to

Actually it also being called as Phonetic Keyboard. This is the term 
used in Murasu Anjal. Correct me if I am wrong.

Message-ID: <92f9a9560601101438h5e1a3dd7waefd85a36b287131@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Sorry to hijack this thread, and I'm probably OT as well...

Does anyone know where I can buy removable HDD trays in Chennai?  I have
vanilla 3.5" SATA HDDs on my Linux boxen that I want to hot swap.  I've seen
el-cheapo HDD trays online for as low as $20-$30 a pop, and they claim to be
hot swappable.  See

http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1599963&CatId=285
http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1194133&CatId=285

I've seen this work wonderfully on WinXP even with regular IDE HDDs - you
disable the ATA channel in the "Device Manager", and unplug.  When you plug
the disk back into the box, you "scan for hardware changes" and you're all set.
No need to power-off or even reboot.

I would also love to hear from anyone who has tried hot swapping SATA on
Linux.

For your requirement I suggest SCIM.
 I was collecting Tamil typing related softwares. I searched various
Tamizh groups and sites. I think these will be definitely useful to
all.

Installing and enabling SCIM:
Fedora core 4 or any Linux.Use yum to install these rpms:

m17n-db-1.2.0-1.fc4
m17n-db-generic-1.2.0-1.fc4
m17n-db-datafiles-1.2.0-1.fc4
m17n-lib-devel-1.2.0-1.fc4
m17n-db-tamil-1.2.0-1.fc4
m17n-lib-1.2.0-1.fc4
scim-m17n-0.1.4-1.fc4
scim-devel-1.4.2-5.fc4
scim-libs-1.4.2-5.fc4
scim-doc-1.4.2-5.fc4
scim-1.4.2-5.fc4
scim-input-pad-0.1.0-3.fc4
scim-tables-0.5.4-2.fc4
scim-tables-tamil-0.5.4-2.fc4
scim-qtimm-0.9.4-0.fc4

A file has to be added to tweak things a bit:

GTK_IM_MODULE=scim
QT_IM_MODULE=scim
XIM_PROGRAM="scim -d"
XMODIFIERS=@im=SCIM

Save this content as file : /home/ignacius/.i18n

Logout and Login.Now you must be able to select the input method as
SCIM and start typing in Unicode Tamizh[There are two options :
inscript and phonetic].

And others who are interested in fonts,groups and softwares,follow these links:

This is a silent offer I got my nearlyfreespeech.net. I thought it would be
helpful for you guys.

From: nearlyfreespeech.net staff

We've noticed that the most common objection people have that prevents
them from signing up for our service is the question "Are these guys
for real?"  We've also noticed that sometimes people who are sending
checks or paying via PayPal eCheck don't want to wait to get started
with our service.

Consequently, we're offering new members a free
$0.02 account credit when they sign up and create an account.  This is
enough to become a full member of our service and start creating
websites.  (However, we recommend not using Basic DNS in conjunction
with the free trial.)

We're not planning to make a lot of noise
about this yet; we're posting this as an announcement for our existing
members without mentioning it on our public site.  We also don't know
whether this will prove to be a good idea or not, so we might kill
this promo at any time.  So if you've got friends that you think might
want to try NearlyFreeSpeech.NET out, now might the time to let them
know.

Of course, since we're not one of those "new customers are
better than old customers" companies, we're in the process of working
out the best way to give each of our active (paid) members $0.02 of
free service as well. Adjunct members will receive the credit if they
create an account of their own.

Thanks for being a member of
NearlyFreeSpeech.NET!  (Now the web host where *everybody* gets to put
their two cents in!)

Or else if you want to have the latest installed compiler as the default one, just redirect the cc to the latest gcc.
do this.
First know the gcc-4.0.2 location (latest gcc). lets say it is /usr/local/bin/gcc
rm /usr/bin/cc
ln -s /usr/local/bin/gcc /usr/bin/cc

Now u compile and test the default gcc

I registered a domain on Jan 8 and was activated within a few hours(i
don't remember exact time)
The next day(after changing my nameservers) I was browsing my new site
(http://www.fslog.com)
I would refer yahoo for domains.

Check out http://lurker.sourceforge.net/

It uses RDBMS to store mails. Supports a lot of features. "graphical

hey,

 is building linux from src is what u r talking about???


developing linux from scratch is a project started with the aim to help
people build their  own customized base system. many people  have the
misconception  that compiling the kernel from source is LFS. this is
absolutely wrong.

Plz give me a direction to proceed...im very much interested.. thanks..


u can visit http://linuxfromscratch.org for details on how to proceed.
gud luck !

 Removable PATA trays have been around for a long time, so I'm sure that
the SATA versions must be available at Ritchie Street, too.

I've seen this work wonderfully on WinXP even with regular IDE HDDs - you

  PATA is not hot-swappable electrically. This may have worked just by
chance,
but the odds are fairly high that there'll be permanent buffer damage sooner
or later, either to the drive electronics or the Southbridge on the
motherboard.
It's like external SCSI: a lot of people are surprised to learn that SCSI is
not
hot-pluggable and can in fact be damaged if plugged in while one of the
devices is powered on. It works some of the time, but the electrical specs
do not permit this to be safely performed all the time.

OTOH, this will probably work OK with SATA.

Hi,

I personally don't know. From what i could see from their group page
is chennai_linuxusers group has larger userr base (~77) but less
active (2 in 7 days). Chennai-lug has a smaller user base (~37) than
chennai_linuxusers but more active (9 in 7 days) than
chennai_linuxusers. Both the list are moderated. Chennai-lug has a
chennai address (Buzullah road, T.Nagar). These you might have already
known. These are the home page of these groups are at:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/chennai-lug/

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/chennai_linuxusers/

Thanks bharthi for letting me know.

with regards,
ashwin

Did you discount Fred Noronha's posts? :)

chennai-lug is not moderated - I signed up for it. The archives
consist almost entirely of "Tamil actresses' pics", "earn a degree
online" and "are you looking for a job?" kind of stuff from a few
websites - all peddled by the same character - a Priyanka Agarwal.

Essentially, a dead list. Sign up only if you can tolerate the extra spam :)

Message-ID: <6ef305610601122247k5d267150s272a35372de22ba@mail.gmail.com>

hello friends..

 i have a scenario..
where in the user fills up the form (buy.php) along with the credit card
details and when he submits, the credit card details are passed to a second
page which is a hidden page (hiddenvaldate.php) where in i call the a
webservice to validate the credit card and, if it comes out to be success
then i redirect him to third page success page (success.php) and if its
comes out to invalid details then i again redirect him to buy.php saying ..
"invalid credit card.."

ok fine the problem is..once the user has been sent to success.php page..and
if he clicks the back button from the browser..and the values entered in the
form fields are passed to the webservice..once again..!
so i want to avoid this situation ..! please help me out..

one way what i think is that to clear the cache..when the user click the
back button..!
but how to do that.. will it work..?


Thanks in advance..!

Add the following line in buy.php.

<?php
header('Cache-Control: no-cache no-store max-age=0'); // try not to cache data
// ...
?>

You can also use the "Pragma: no-cache" header for older browsers that
don't support HTTP 1.1.

Hi pple,
Has anybody got firefox to play with an embedded realplayer?? (in lunux )
Sites like raaga.com do not use a stand-alone real player. My firefox
in works well with raaga.. but the linux version stops with "loading".
There are a few solutions suggested in the following page
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~scs49/install_linux.html (scroll down)
.. but none of them worked for me!

Thanks in advance,
Aswin

The person said that the college recently had an agreement with M$ and
they insisted on loading M$ XP in all the machines. So they formatted
the entire setup. Hence the work we did on that day more than six
hours went in vain :(

for what its worth, at least they want it done again. I have seen 
this problem when the person who has the AMC refuses to service or 
honour warranty unless M$ is reloaded. I have had to go once or 
twice to reinstall for this reason. It happens, all part of the war 
with the other side using dirty tactics

No., thats not the exact case. The first time itself., they made the
volunteers run around a bit. They ask them to come over a couple of
times., and then send them back with some excuse. Their attitude towards
the volunteers was very bad., and showed no gratitude.

The point is that the staff/management there is not ready to involve
someone from their side to learn the thing and do continuous maintenance
of the setup. When there is pressure for a FOSS lab (because of the FOSS
elective), they ask for Community help. They made absolutely no effort
to put some effort in learning and maintaining the lab.

What they expect is full hand-holding-service at no cost. I dont think
that should be happening.

Not sure of the browser, but the webserver certainly is.

Then again, if you believe the GNU-heads, the operating system is the
kernel plus the userland software - which certainly includes several
browsers.

+1. There's no rule that you can't make money off free software. The 
software might free, but your time & efforts are not. I see a good 
opportunity a for a few enthusiastic people to get together and offer a 
FOSS-based AMC to the college.

When you give something free, in most cases the beneficiary will not
realize its worth.

I've been suggesting that on the GLUG Madurai mailing list. But., I dont
want it to be considered as a GLUG initiated issue. It'll attract
unwanted complications.

Subject: [Ilugc] FYI: 'Community' is not 'un-paid labour'

Dear friends,

My thoughts below:

First of all congratulations to the volunteers at
Madurai GLUG for taking the initiative in setting up
FLOSS labs, and helping the folks at SIT. 

There are very few people, I have seen in India, who
take initiatives, who motivate others to learn, and
help them even when it is way out of their reach. You
are one among them. I salute you.

If I were in Madurai ...

1. I wouldn't waste time helping them again.

2. If asked for help, I would provide them contact of
FLOSS consultants for setting up/maintenance of labs.

3. Feel sympathetic, empathetic, and sorry for their
ignorance and move on.

Message-ID: <20060113152827.56784.qmail@web50205.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

Thanks for your inputs. I have now purchased the
following:

* Hitachi 80 GB HDD 7200 RPM for Rs.2500

* Gemini 3.5" external hdd casing for Rs. 725.

at Sagar Infosystems, Ritchie Street, Chennai.

I plugged it to the USB port of my T41 running Debian
GNU/Linux and it was detected as /dev/sda. I
partitioned it, and ran mke2fs to create the
filesystems. 

Everything works great by default. Was able to take
the necessary backups.

Regards,

SK

been waiting for a software like this. I am able to read your tamil mail
in thunderbird. Will this extension work in thundrbird too?, so that I
can draft mails in tamil.

But unfortunately I am not able to download and test it, since my
firewall does not allow these sites (stupid firewall considers all my
favourite sites such as open source, linux as blacklisted one). I am
waiting for the arrival of my sysadmin to come to office on next week,
put a request to him so that I can use it happily.

Note: My frustration on this firewall has to gone to such a extent that
I have written a small firefox extension which builds and sends a access
request mail to sysadmin whenever a site is blocked. This extension is
pending for approval in addons of mozilla.

OK,

So either my HW is screwed up or I'm doing something really silly.

I have a 10GB HDD as my secondary slave.
I run fdisk and delete all existing partitions.
I create a new single ext2 partition on it so that it occupies the
whole disk(10 G).

Till now I've just used fdisk and mke2fs to create this partition.
here's fdisk/parted info.

FDISK
-------
Command (m for help): p

Disk /dev/hdc: 10.2 GB, 10242892800 bytes
16 heads, 63 sectors/track, 19846 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 1008 * 512 = 516096 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hdc1   *           1       19846    10002352+  83  Linux

PARTED
----------
Using /dev/hdc
(parted) print
Disk geometry for /dev/hdc: 0.000-9768.383 megabytes
Disk label type: msdos
Minor    Start       End     Type      Filesystem  Flags
1          0.031   9767.953  primary   ext2        boot

Now I try to mount this partition.
sekrity:~# mkdir /mnt/disk
sekrity:~# mount /dev/hdc1 /mnt/disk/
mount: /dev/hdc1 already mounted or /mnt/disk/ busy
sekrity:~# mount -t ext2 /dev/hdc1 /mnt/disk/
mount: /dev/hdc1 already mounted or /mnt/disk/ busy

This is where my problem is.
While trying to mount it says it's already mounted!
I tried the same after a reboot, same problem.

Linux identifies the disk after a reboot too.
sekrity:~# dmesg | grep hdc
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xffa8-0xffaf, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hdc: ST310212A, ATA DISK drive

hdc: 20005650 sectors (10242 MB) w/512KiB Cache, CHS=19846/16/63, UDMA(33)

If you are thinking that this disk is already mounted, it's not!

sekrity:~# cat /proc/mounts
rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0
/dev2/root2 / ext3 rw 0 0
proc /proc proc rw,nodiratime 0 0

tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
usbfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
tmpfs on /dev type tmpfs (rw,size=10M,mode=0755)

sekrity:~# cat /etc/mtab

tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs rw 0 0
usbfs /proc/bus/usb usbfs rw 0 0
tmpfs /dev tmpfs rw,size=10M,mode=0755 0 0

sekrity:~# cat /etc/fstab
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
/dev/hda1       /               ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0       1
/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto  0       0

I've tried a differnet HDD (same make,10GB) and the same problem persists.

Any help/ideas/inputs on why this is happening ?
Googling around I found many references to this problem but no solution.

Thanks.

Can you try posting the strace output of the mount command? You might
get to know what exactly is going wrong.

sekrity:~# strace mount /dev/hdc1 /mnt/disk/

I have a doubt. Secondary Slave means it should be /dev/hdd, right? How
come you operate on hdc?

EBUSY is the corresponding error code returned by system call 'mount'.
The reason could be one of the given below:

1. /dev/hdc1is already mounted.
2. /dev/hdc1 cannot be remounted read-only.
3. /mnt/disk1 or /dev/hdc1 still holds files open for writing.
4. /dev/hdc1 cannot be mounted on target because /mnt/disk1 is still
busy (it is the  working  directory  of some task, the mount point of
another device, has open files, etc.).
5. /mnt/disk1 could not be unmounted because it is busy.

It's not.
mtab and fstab have no entries.

It's not mounted to be re-mounted so I guess we can discount this point.

disk1 is empty.
hdc1 is a fresh ext2 partition.
and mke2fs completes with no problems

an `lsof /dev/hdc1` turns up nothing.

It's not mounted to be un-mounted.

Damn! Is this an ATA-kernel bug ?
Let me try mounting it on a different PC.

Does formatting it as ext3 work? It might not solve your problem, but
will help us eliminate possibilities.

Nope.Same problem.
ext3 partition is created but can't be mounted.

Can you toggle that "bootable" flag and see if it helps? In fdisk, the
command to do that is 'a'.

If that does not work, also try:

dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/hdc bs=512 count=1

and repartition the disk, and run mke2fs.

I had created the partition with the boot flag unset.
Had set it to see if I can mount it with it set.

What role does LVM has to play here ?
It's a straightforward mount of an ext2 partition.

Ah well, I'm out of ideas, then :) Check the disk jumper settings to
see if it is actually set to be secondary master, try the disk on one
of the other IDE slots (hdb/hdd), try the disk in another computer,
try another disk in the same computer etc. etc....

Hi,

I would like to backup my files in my thinkpad to my desktop. My

3.1 only. I would like to know what is the best way to do this? This
thinkpad is my dad's, so i can't install linux in it. Can i use usb
for file transfer? The desktop was a 1999 make & thinkpad is 2003

The desktop spec are:
Asus P2B-F motherboard, Pentium III (katami) , 10GB Seagate HDD, USB

This one just got funnier...
So, I got the HDD in question and installed Debian on it.
Installation went fine and the disk managed to boot debian.

fsck checks all ran fine.This shows the HDD is in good shape.
No bad blocks etc etc.

Now, I had another HDD of the same make as the "original culprit".
That one was giving me the same problems originally, i.e the 'already
mounted' problem.

When I tried to mount that disk, it mounted fine with no errors on the
"original culprit".

So, now I have a HDD with what I wanted in it and am happy.
Still puzzles me why mount was giving me that problem.

It looks more like a 'mount' bug.Finding what went wrong is not for today.
Time for a good night's sleep.

Thanks guys.

Sometime back there was talk of a firefox plugin based on Totem for
playing streaming audio/video.This was being written by Bastein
Neocera.

If you are on Debian, check unstable.Considering Bastein's association
with RH I guess it should be in rawhide(atleast).

I know you wanted RealPlayer, But totem with the right plugins can
handle real media, and the best part is, its FOSS!

I do have debian.. will try it.
And, Can I can ask firefox to use Totem for realmedia from even sites
like raaga.com ??
I dont think a simple file-association would work here...

Don't we have gstreamer plugins for real-media.
I was ofcourse not refering to the gstreamer package that ships with FC/RH.
One will need to install proprietary plugins from a third-party.

You can.
You might need to tweak your profiles.ini file in ~/.mozilla/firefox
I'm really not sure as I'm not a streaming media guy.
Google around and you should be good to go. :)

I saw a lot of references for a "firefox totem plugin" Google search.

Not much of an inside information. Rawhide is a public tree with a open

We do but those are either not under a FOSS license or patent encumbered

Subject: [Ilugc] NTFS to ext3 file transfer how ?

Hi,

I would like to backup my files in my thinkpad to my desktop. My
thinkpad is Windows XP SP2 home edition to my desktop which is debian
3.1 only. I would like to know what is the best way to do this? This
thinkpad is my dad's, so i can't install linux in it. Can i use usb
for file transfer? The desktop was a 1999 make & thinkpad is 2003
make. The desktop doesn't have the luxury of wireless file transfer.
The desktop spec are:
Asus P2B-F motherboard, Pentium III (katami) , 10GB Seagate HDD, USB
1.1 port (2 of them).
Thinkpad spec are:
http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/quickPath.do?quickPathEntry=2684l

------------eof original msg-----------------

Try syncback from www.2brightsparks.com. Has a free version and can back up
files on schedule. Pretty good one. Needs to be installed on Windows and can
back up to an FTP server.

Doesn't BSNL give a Router/Modem combo? The one I got was like that!
If you got a USB only modem then ask them for the router. Am sure they
will oblige.

Message-ID: <a1da1e5e0601152042g68f4e5eeo8a7e9c031ec11e60@mail.gmail.com>

I have released a simple firefox extension called "Request Access". It
sends a request mail to your system admin to whitelist a site when it
is blocked by your firewall. It has been approved by Mozilla. For more
info:

https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&id=1826

This is my first OSS contribution. Thanks to my office firewall which
consider most of the linux and OSS sites as Game category and blocks,
I have developed it.

I welcome your comment and suggestion on it. If anybody want to
enhance this extension, you are welcome.

1. Transfer through a USB key.

OR

2. Use a cross-over cable between desktop and laptop
and use scp/ftp to transfer the file. You need to have
sshd or a FTP server running on either machine.

When you transfer files between two systems, to the
e-n-d u-s-e-r filesystems don't matter, directly. What
really matters is the medium of transfer.

In case 1, you are transferring to a medium through
USB. As long as both the desktop and laptop can
recognize the USB (detect it and the filesystem), you
should be able to transfer the file.

In case 2, the medium is ethernet. As long as both
machines can communicate via TCP/IP, for example, you
will be able to transfer files. It is independant of
what filesystem you use.

HTH,

SK

But they should have given a second thought before removing GNU/Linux.
They would have thought about the work of the volunteers.. Is this all
because we have done it for free??? Do people think that one who does
things for free are cheap and they wont have any difficulty in coming
second time to do the same work redundantly , because they dont have
any other work???

Hmm., I think thats the picture that these SIT guys have got. As I
already mentioned on the GLUG Madurai list., the way they made you and
the other guys go around to _help_ them setup a lab was not very nice.
And., their current action shows lack of gratitude..

Anywayz., we need to make a smart decision so that we get our job done.,
and also make them realize.

Hello all,

My latest open source project called NaughtySVN (NSVN)
http://naughtysvn.tigris.org/ is now in the public domain. If anybody
interested in contributing to this project, please let me know. Now I
am working on the Alpha release and is expected in mid Jan 2006.

NaughtySVN is an easy-to-use Subversion GUI client which works as an
extension to Nautilus File Manager (Graphical shell for the GNOME
desktop environment). Inspired by TortoiseSVN, Its an effort primarily
for non-technical people to use subversion.

NSVN has a graphical interface which can be activated from Nautilus
file browsing window. Its graphical windows are designed to be simple
and easy to use, which will allow users to create and administer
subversion repository, checkout and commit working copies, handling
working copies, browsing repositories and working copies, handling
remote repositories and working copies etc.

NSVN is written in C and makes use of GNOME Technologies, GTK/GDK,
Nautilus-Extension and glade for building its user-interface.

Bye :)

afaicr, the vanilla kernel provides (or provided.. i dont remember the
\1 of that CONFIG_(.*) ) an option to have a minimalistic http
server... well... for sure, it shouldn't be a part of the kernel, but
these arguments fall flat when performance is a critical issue (which
is, for many web servers today)... this is similar to why we have the
mmx's and sse's these days... wouldn't a add/mul/div been enough?

I too do this for syncing between my laptop and desktop. An additional
luxury if you have linux on atleast one of the ends - use sshfs (fuse)
and it is almost as if you have got both the storage disks at both
ends :) One thing though... shouldn't there be a better solution?
Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't using Ethernet for a point to
point link a non-optimal solution? Any serial port/usb hack possible?

I'd be curious to know why you think so. As far as pure speeds go,
here are some numbers:

Serial: 230400 bps
USB 2.0 Full Speed: 12 Mbps
USB 2.0 Hi Speed: 480 Mbps

Compare those numbers with standard Ethernet operational bandwidths of
10/100/1000 Mbps (half or full duplex).

USB 2.0 Hi Speed devices and ports are VERY rare. Gigabit Ethernet is
not affordable for everyone, especially for home use.

Unless there are other pressing requirements, the best way of
connecting two computers is indeed via an Ethernet connection. Common,
cheap and easy to obtain hardware, a time-tested protocol suite on top
of that with several (hundreds? thousands?) applications, easy to
configure (autoconfigures itself! - RFC 3927) and fast data transfer
rates to satisfy even the most demanding application. :)

hmm.. but the best I could get out of my 100 Mbps Ethernet card in
this p-to-p transfer is around 8 MBps (64 Mbps)... have I reached the
end host latency bottleneck then?

but I was thinking... the physical medium capabilities being the same,
will using a protocol designed for link sharing be optimal for a point
to point link?

> cheap and easy to obtain hardware, a time-tested protocol suite on top

the protocol which these apps use (atop IP) is in a different layer
and independent of the physical medium!

it moves on...

Ohh no! No to serial port. Its damn slow. Even for
embedded, we use ethernet for transferring files
because copying in MB via serial port takes ages ...
in minutes.

The USB 2.0 specification uses a master-slave
protocol. The computer acts as a master and all
devices are slaves. You _cannot_ directly connect two
USB 2.0 devices together. To do that, the USB-IF came
up with On-The-Go (OTG) specification:

http://www.usb.org/developers/onthego/

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go

If the host controllers provide support for OTG, then
the slave (b_peripheral state) can change role to the
host (b_host state), and the host (a_host state) will
change role to the slave (a_peripheral state). b_host
will now transfer data to a_peripheral. This way you
can directly connect, say, a camera to a phone, or a
phone to a printer, avoiding the PC in between. 

If you want to change roles again, using Session
Request Protocol (SRP) and Host Negotiation Protocol
(HNP), the b_host will become b_peripheral and
a_peripheral device will become a_host. a_host can now
transfer data to b_peripheral. The _host supplies
power in USB through the VBUS line.

There are products in the market with OTG support. You
can get them in US and Taiwan.

HTH,

SK

How did you measure the speed? rsync/scp/ftp/http etc. would have
protocol overheads and other delays. The best known tool to measure
bandwidth is iperf. I routinely get upto 90 Mbps on a fastethernet
link as measured by iperf - the rest I write off as link layer
overheads (ethernet frame header etc.)

That's the beauty of TCP/IP. It works just fine irrespective of the
underlying network architecture - be is a broadcast network or a
point-to-point network (or even a serial or parallel port connection).

Yep, but the protocol suite's configuration is the easiest when the
underlying network is, well, a network. SLIP/PLIP (USBIP?? never heard
of it ;) try to address this on other peripheral connectors, but you
must admit the ease of configuration with ethernet is hard to match. I
was just commenting upon the ease of setup and speed of an IP network
to connect two computers as opposed to say, zmodem transfers between
them.

Since you are on RHEL, open a ticket with them and ask for their

Quick question to the OP: Did they even include USB ports in computers
shipped in 1999?? I guess a PCI USB card would be an option if they
didn't, but no clue about driver support of those on Linux.

That's what Binand has mentioned.
TUX is part of 2.4 and is not in mainline 2.6.

Not in the upstream kernel since Ingo decided that with NPTL the 
performance differences weren't major but Fedora and RHEL still include 
it. We got some major deployments too.

yeah... i saw that... i dont remember the name... perhaps this was the
one... though i think i saw that in a 2.6 release... perhaps they
removed it in an early 2.6 release....

I second that. The only trouble with the terminal to terminal ethernet
is a crossover cable is needed.

In future, WiFi and other ethernet related technologies (and IP over
bluetooth!!) might be the only way devices will talk to each other.

I don't agree.  Say its hard, there's no portable way of writing GUI apps.
I have not used wxWindows/GTK, or all those toolkits, so I don't know
how well they're effective or easy to write using one.
Not even Python or Ruby is perfect here, IMHO.

I would any day write my GUI app as a web application or as a Mozilla
application.

Sorry, I didn't quite understand that. My intention was, if it was
python/ruby/php etc., there is a second layer that does the rendering.
The development time is compensated when the application runs. Correct
me if I am wrong. I haven't too much of this!

?!? The only difference between a straight through and
a cross-over cable is that in a cross-over cable, pins
1 (RX+) and 3 (TX+), and 2 (RX-) and 6 (TX-) are
connected. In a straight through 1 (Rx+) is connected
to 1 (RX+), 2 (RX-) is connected to 2 (RX-) and so on.
So, what's the trouble?

Can we maintain correct threading here? This question was posed on and

Well, ask your friendly neighbourhood network technician to make one
for you :) Five to one says that his first crimping effort will result
in a faulty cable (he shouldn't be allowed to refer to any documents,
of course).

Subversion itself is written in C.  It has got Python bindings.  The
choice of 'C' as a language for this particular task may not be as bad
as it sounds  - You need to consider how much of the SVN api is
exposed through C (vs Python), the fact that of the lot of
GTK/Nautilus stuff is also C, etc.  Also SVN uses Apache Portable
Runtime internally as it's primary higher-level C library .

I think some work was done on the Ruby bindings to SVN as part of the
Google sponsored Summer of Code program.

Alex, congrats BTW - Now you don't have to wait 3 months for a 25 line

Isn't it cheap to buy one that has been crimped

it sure works! thats the entire point behind layering.. I was talking
abt the suitability (in terms of efficiency) of Ethernet as a physical
layer protocol (not TCP/IP) in p2p environments...my reasoning was
this... more of "something of this sort should be there or atleast
should be written"... given the same copper wire, we can surely get
something better than what Ethernet with its CSMA/CD and its 30%
efficient (that's for a populated network, in our case, this may be
slightly higher) protocol can achieve, when we have only two hosts to
connect...

> of it ;) try to address this on other peripheral connectors, but you

who can deny that! ethernet thrives mostly because of this one reason :)

it moves on...

I have heard of this cross over cable as well, but I just use the same
cable I use to connect any switch, to connect to the other comp,
without any problems... is that "crossed over" as well?

You misunderstood my point. I was talking about the "history" (time).

I had problems with External HDD that connects through usb port. The
drive was formatted as ntfs & my desktop (linux) had problems
recognising the HDD.

Is the cross-over cable same as a cat5 cable?

The computer was manucfured in '99 but i bought that in mid-2000. It

Be clear about your problem. Please clarify whether your problem is
configuring your LAN card in ubuntu 5.10 or configuring dataone in
ubuntu 5.10. Show and explain the error you face. IMO, setting both

If there are so many p to p transfers taking place and ethernet is
really a bottleneck then an alternate would've been developed. That it
does not exist means that either there are not too many such instances
around the world or that it is not a bottleneck. Or both!

Its a question of economic feasibility - if the effort required to
develop a tool to solve a problem is greater than the effort required
to use existing tools and solve the same problem, then it makes sense
to use existing tools to solve the problem.

As Binand pointed out, how many crossover cables can one find lying

The techonolgy exists and sure there are implementations but am
talking about widespread adoption by the non geek public. Like how
ethernet is being used now. WHen people stop talking about the
physical and datalink layer itself. Like how there are no more
arguements about TCP/IP and other competing protocols.

I think modern switches can autodetect the kind of cable connected and
configure their TX and RX pins accordingly. Which is why the "uplink"
port has become obsolete on these switches.

IEEE probably has a standard document on this somewhere.

I can shed more light on this once I'm in office and login to CCO.

Don't beat around the bush.

The reason for TCP/IP on ethernet to be successful is
because it was simple. Remember, even when OSI was a
standard model, TCP/IP became popular because it
worked.

You would have connected to an uplink port.

A regular port on a hub/switch crosses the TX/RX pins
and hence you connect a regular cable.

An uplink port on a hub/switch does not cross the
TX/RX pins, and hence the pins in the cable need to be
crossed.

Haha! Please don't reply for the sake of replying.

A switch operates in layer 2 (data-link), while a
router operates in layer 3 (IP).

This was the norm several years ago; most modern switches from vendors
like Cisco or Foundry are L3-capable. In fact, with the correct IOS
version, something as lowly as a Catalyst 3550 can do full BGP these
days.

in fact it is not just the switch... my room has a wire running to the
hostel switch, and i connect my comp to this line using the same
cable...

No... I didn't connect to the uplink port... Binand's explanation

I think it's got to do with the definition then. I look at it as - if
the device is L3 capable, it *is* a router...

The quick way of identifying a crossover cable is:

Hold the two ends of the cable together, with the locking tab downwards.
Look inside the RJ45 connector and observe the wire colours.

A straight cable will have the colours in the same order.
A rollover cable will have the colours in one end -reversed- in the other.
A crossover cable will have pins 1 & 3 swapped, and pins 2 & 6 swapped.

The colour order is (and every network engineer should know this
by-heart): white-orange, orange, white-green, blue, white-blue, green,
white-brown, brown.

Thus, a crossover cable will have white-orange and white-green
swapped, and orange and green swapped. The second one is probably
easier to observe.

If its a router (which just cannot divorce the layer 2 and operate in
isolation) then a crossover cable would be used to connect to another
computer. Get the hang of why I said what I said now?

It does exist, of course. It is called Gigabit Ethernet. If you look
at popular vendors' websites (like HP or IBM or Dell), you'll find
that 1000BaseT is the norm for network connectivity in new computers
rather than the exception. I'll be surprised if you can find non-Cat6
cables in the market these days (either pre-crimped or DIY kits).

I was referring to 'ethernet' inclusive of all those techonologies
that evolve out of it... gigabit, 10gig even WiFi, WiMax etc. By
alternates I mean USB, Bluetooth, or any other non ethernet based
technologies.

Of course there will be little similarities between 10BaseT and WiMax
but the basic CSMA/CD, the way MA and CD is achieved  is still the
same! Or may be am wrong. Been years since I updated my network layer
implementation stuff. Would welcome being disabused.

Well, your definition :) These are marketed as L3 switches or routing
switches. The fact is that with increased demand for datacenter space,
one really cannot afford to go for different devices for the switching
and routing layers. The modern network is almost always made up of the
paradigm of core and edge switches, with the cores doing L3 routing.

To take an example, I can use just one Cisco 3750 switch to connect up
a cabinet full of servers, seperate them into different VLANs, install
access control policies between the VLANs (basic firewall), route
between the VLANs and the ISP uplink, provide various application
services to my LAN (DHCP, NAT), advertise my own IP block using OSPF
or BGP or whatever - all in 1U space. The 48-port version is more than
ample for a decently sized online business. In the older version, one
would have needed separate router, switch, firewall and a couple of 1U
servers to do all that - about 15% of the cabinet is gone already.

If you are on Linux/Unix/OSX, then open a command prompt and type
'dig'. Look for the line:

;; SERVER: 10.10.12.91#53(10.10.12.91)

If you are on Windows, open a command prompt and type 'nslookup'. Look for

Default Server:  <snip>
Address:  10.10.12.91

Mind you, those are your DNS caches. DNS servers are a diffferent type
of beast altogether.

 not so, the performace and speed is good.All interfaces are provided by
Maxtor itself , its not like the other option available wherein you buy
hard-disk separately,casing separately and then convert it to usb using usb
converter....it is direct usb support plug and play...here is the link -
http://www.maxtor.com/portal/site/Maxtor/menuitem.ba88f6d7cf664718376049b291346068/?channelpath=/en_us/Products/External%20Storage/Personal%20Storage%20Family/Personal%20Storage%203100

i bet you will love these type of external hard-disks. Not only Maxtor,
iOmega rules the Market, but its costly and at the same time BEST
PERFORMANCE. If you see these brands, you will find usb settings done
already.

And morover if you use something like Python., you can later recode
compute-intensive parts (modules) in C without affecting the rest of
your code.

Cyrus IMAPd already has IMAP properly implemented. There wont be many
places for improvement over there. Look into their TODO file for the
features/bugs that the project is planning to work on.

Some ethernet cards are coming with Auto-MDIX feature. This is used to 
dected the cable and reconfigure the pins.

a cross over cable is different.i am using a crossover cable

like a breeze; no probs whatsoever;
2. More important the chap there offered to trake itr back if

Cross over cable is also a CAT 5 with small change in pin

Every Apple Macintosh made in the last 4 years offers this feature.  You
can connect two Macs with any old ethernet cable and it just works.

Another nifty trick is that the internal HDD is also connected to the Firewire
port.  You can connect two Macs together using a Firewire cable, and
mount the the target computer HDD on the host computer like a regular
Firewire HDD.  Google for "Target Disk Mode".

Such meticulous attention to detail speaks volumes about Apple's design
quality.

For those of us who use PCs, here's an old trick:
Make a cross-over cable adapter.  It's ~2 inches of ethernet cable with a
male RJ45 connector on one end and a female on the other.  The cable
inbetween is crossed. If you want a cross cable, but only have a patch
on hand, use use this extension on one end.  If you want a patch, but only
have a cross, you use the same extension.  Saves making lengthy
cross-cables that you rarely end up using.

Binand's point that it has all come down to how the company wants to
market a product is the truth.

For e.g. Cisco's highest end 'switch' is the Catalyst 6500.  It does
L3 as well, ofcourse, and is called a Switch-Router.  The *same* box,
loaded with a different IOS feature set (routing protocols and stuff),
is marketed as the 7600 router.  The Catalyst 6500 is where the switch
and router lines of Cisco converge.

This switch router convergence business takes some time getting used
to.  It drives Cisco engineers, support staff and customers nuts...

Actually, my point was about datacenter consolidation. This one about
the convergence of switches and routers, the predominance of blade
servers, popularity of virtualisation etc. all support this view of
mine.

All of Cisco's newer switches - the 3750, the 4506, the 4510 (these
are not all that new, though) - support both L2 and L3. Some older
ones (ie, ones that haven't reached end-of-life yet) can still be
upgraded to full L3 if the hardware is compatible.

Cisco's pure routers still have a market - I do believe the 26xx
series routers are the best for an office DSL connection. Their
carrier grade routers still drive 80% of Internet traffic. But in the
in-between market, there is an increasing trend towards merging these
two product lines - routers and switches - saving premium resources in
the datacenter, space/power/HVAC capacity.

And even though I have been talking about Cisco all the time, these
observations are applicable to the others - like Foundry - as well.

TN govt had declared that TN state board students dont need to write
any entrance exam, and that the admission is going to be solely based
on +2 marks. This would help ppl who mug up the book from end to end
(mostly without thorough understanding of concepts) to get into top
colls. Though I dont claim that TNPCEE is a high standard entrance
exam, atleast it filters out ppl who meagrely mug up, to some extent.

I'm sending this mail to ilugc just because there are many students
and alumnus from different colleges here. Even if a small percentage
of us would sign the following petition, its going to bring up big
number on the board.

Those who feel that entrance exam is a must, plz sign the petition.

I don't mean to generalize here. Ppl go to coaching centers, learn
easy/shortcut methods to solve problems, master the tricks  may be. helping
many  clear the entrance test, probably still  without thorough
understanding of concepts.

Alright, three years later, after passing 12th from TN board, I met ppl from
the same class, doing BE CS in one of the reputed Engg Colleges in town
(that time in their third year).  As far as I can tell, they didn't seem to
have any love/interest for the subject.

Coming to the point, how many student opted for Engineering course  (IT, CS
here) because they love it? And how many does simply because  the scope is
good, parents like the idea, they hear so many success stories, because it
is the trend.

Could this be the reason why there are always  so many BE candidates for any
god damn job interviews?

"To mug up" according to this link

http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/20/messages/183.html

is to "to study hard " not necessarily learning by heart lessons without
understanding. It probably has become a local slang to refer to  learning by
heart without
understanding. My assumptions, that is.

Whatever, I say those who work hard, should get the reward.

Anyway, if one can score high marks  by mugging up (as in what it is meant
locally),  say the fault lies with the education/examination system.

Q. Explain ........... in detail exactly as given in the text book.( Then I
will give you full mark)

That's IMHO.

i agree totally with the above points...when i completed my 12th in 2000, i
didnt have more workload.now the workload is more,dont know why a comp
student shud learn all languages...and we computer engineers know that it
will take some time to excel in one language since practice is required..but
if you take 12th syllabus, you will find all languages - java,visual basic,
c,c ++..what is the use?...nothing, just you can boast that it is
there...there is no chane you can get practical experience...

coming to tnpcee, no way you can judge  a person using his tnpcee
result...tnpcee is just sheer luck, not a single school can train students
that much for tnpcee, its only few who succeed....

and the current education scenario is bad according to me...i mean, it is
not necessary to bring such a workload...

and anna university gives mark if you write the same as how is in the book,
so what would students do?, phrame definitions on their own?..ask them to
try, you will find him sitting for exam another year...

"Reputed Engineering Colleges"? Please.

Other than IIT, I don't consider any other as an
engineering college/institute. First they need to
become engineering colleges, then we shall see if we
can give them the tag of "reputed".

Shakthi that might be right to some extent... but that's not the point we
are discussing here... Even there should be good entry criteria for so
called reputed colleges... or else we will lose the value of real
engineers.... even that's the case rite now in tamil nadu... govt should
take some steps to stops this rather than eradicating TNCPEE..

i 've clearly mentioned that i too dont beleive in TNPCEE. But, some
entrance is better than no entrance. In state board exam, they dont
even change the numbers in the book question. in TNPCEE atleast they
change the models of the problems slightly(though not enough to test
any intelligence). I've seen many of my schoolmates who memorize for
maths. Some also get 195-200 that way. Atleast TNPCEE makes things
difficult for them. the fact that there is no entrance
exam at all is going to encourage such people.

I dont think the govt would hear someone who wants to implement better
screening procedures. But atleast lets try to retain the screening
procedure at the current level than to let it degrade.

Faculty, and management are important too. You can't
do things without their permission. 

Let me give you an example:

We were planning a GNU/Linux workshop for a college in
Chennai, was to be scheduled on Saturday, January 7,
2006. The student was very much interested in VLSI,
chip design (on GNU/Linux obviously), and took the
initiative to talk to the faculty about it. Instead of
simply saying yes/no, the staff started shouting at
the student. It is such people who neither learn,
improve themselves nor let others learn, are the ones
who are preventing the education system from
developing/progressing.

One should atleast come to a position where they can
do the work done by IIT, then we can think about
absolute values and where you go from there.

This is a very important issue, "quality" of
education, and we have been addressing this to
colleges with the help of FLOSS. 

I'll stop here.

Let's have this discussion in our month's GLUG meet
agenda.

SK

I hope we get over this fixation for degrees and certificates. I used
to believe that colleges build ones personality but looking at the
absurd rules imposed on students I'm of the opinion that every effort
is taken to destroy a students' personality and then let them loose in
the wild wild world. We might even see a day when teaching of mobile
technologies in engineering colleges are banned because they corrupt
students minds!!!

Anyway, from my own experience I can say that only 20% of my education
happened in college :) . So, if one can manage the 20%
himself/herself, college is not essential for a successful life. I
think the web will make this possible.

You will need the original Windows XP CD, which has a rescue mode
(they call it the Recovery Console). The command to run is "fixmbr".

http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/Windows/XP/all/reskit/en-us/prkd_tro_ldau.asp

And next time, backup your MBR before you fiddle around with dual booting :)

That is quite the wrong attitude to take. I must say 100% of my
education happened at college (even though I have learned quite a lot
on job over the past several years, when I landed my first job, I had
only my education to back on).

Engineering education is not about learning by rote. It is about
learning a new way of thinking. As they say, Engineering is where pure
mathematics meet practical realities, and it is all about the
compromises one has to make to meet the objectives of the other. It
doesn't really matter whether one is a mechanical or chemical
engineer, as long as one learns to think like an engineer. Probably
this is where all the engineering colleges in India has failed.

To take an example: I studied aerospace engineering at IITB. In our
aircraft design course, we learnt that - if one engine on a plane can
generate enough thrust to carry 100 passengers, pure mathematics tells
us that a 4-engine plane can carry 400 passengers. But engineering
tells us that real life is not that simple; one has to take into
consideration the chance of an engine failure at 40000 feet above
ground. Thus, an engineer would put the capacity of the plane at 300
(or even 200) to allow for one (or even two engine) failures while
flying.

Years later, I was designing a network where a pair of load-balanced
firewalls were to take the load of about 40000 simultaneous customers
for a mission critical system. Each firewall could handle 75000
simultaneous sessions - so the network capacity is 150,000, right?
That's what pure mathematics tells us. But no, an engineer would put
the capacity at 75,000, and would want to scale the network up when
the number of customers hit about 60% of that (providing for bursts is
another thing one learns in an engineering education). And that's what
I did - and was vindicated when one of the firewalls went bust
(motherboard fried) soon after upgrading to a higher capacity version.
Imagine what would have happened if we were complacent that our
network could handle loads upto 150k and the firewall crashed when the
load hit 80k.

This particular design didn't have anything to do with aerospace
engineering - but everything to do with engineering. Which is why
nobody will trust mission critical systems to a 12th-pass with a
couple of highfalutin certifications, but will rely on trained
engineers instead.

Agree. Not just engineering but generally any place of education
should focus on teaching how to learn.

Each problem requires a unique solution. I wouldn't allow a high
school dropout to operate on me! The point I make is that, if one is
bent on succeeding in life, college education is a mere subplot!

Rightly said. Not every one can become Linus Torvalds. If they did, then
that is the end of the world. :-)

Well, I did love it. But after taking CS course in CEG, I lost all hope,
except for the small, but intensive motivation that I got from open source.
I remember giving a Python seminar (along with a couple of my friends) in
final year. No one showed interest. That was hurting.

The students are great! (that is why significant number of people get
selected in major companies that value their skills). It is their
conditioning that must be cursed.  Well, if your CS classmate is very good
in carnatic, just because that he loves it, that is great.  Students who
wander as per the environment surrounding them (eg: attending exams and
doing chit chats in life) and who doesn't really value 'love' are their own
problems.

Petitions are a kind of fancy. Only friendship can win over people. If a
professor is a close friend of mine, I would listen (or contemplate) to his
words more than a normal teacher.  Love is lacking in college campuses. So
people form diverse groups leading to diversification among the student and
the teacher. I would like to see teachers attending student's birthday
party, for example. I would like to see teachers going along with students
to cinema, etc ... I would like to see the teachers learning and working
*along* with the student. I would like to see a conglomeration of knowledge
in any thing I see.

"Progress through knowledge"? wtf? Are we creating markets? When will action
take over words?

Well, it's 0% for Steve Jobs.

I think for Bill Gates too. But for every Jobs or Gates, there are
many million drop outs who now probably are selling burgers at the
nearest fast food joint or operating the nearest petrop pump.

Not everyone is capable of becoming a business tycoon. A large
percentage still needs to work 9-5 Monday to Friday. For that, an
education is mandatory.

Well,

That reminds me about a story about Jobs.
While trying to pitch Mac's to a University, one of the professor's
told him that they were not interested in Mac's and were looking
forward to the "3M" machine from IBM which was coming out the next
year.

Steve, never to be taken aback, said boldly "Well Apple will have the
first 3M machine,I can assure you".

"What's a 3M machine ?"he asked next, to which the professor said: "A
machine which can do 1 megaflop,has 1MB RAM and a million pixel
display."

Steve cooly says,"Yes, we are working on that right now.But tell me..
what's a Megaflop?!"

Way OT, I know,but shows you that in Steve's case
education/engineering means nothing.
It's pure love/passion for his work and belief in his company.

why dont you use a good package manager like yum(rpm) or apt-get (dpkg),
this will make the upgrade process a lot more nicer :-)

I dont agree with this. The TNPCEE is far more suited to test the
understanding of concepts compared the 12th standard board exams.

this is true.. its often our of peer pressure  and tailing the group

well in the case of the board exams... "by hearting" will do. Hard work
is essential, but genius needs to be awarded too :-)

Not really. again, I am not sure if your apache is 1.1.x!
> please let me know  upgrading rules and configure rules.
configure greatly depends on what all you want to do with your php.
just run  ./configure --help and get the list of options. Choose your
options based on the list.

You might want to have apache with apxs build. You won't even have to
remove the old php. only the module file is changed from libphp4.so to
libphp5.so. all else remains same.

Don't try to very objective as well. :-) Would you *compare* yourself with

one of the meets for sure.. But just discussion wont help.. We need to 
figure out a way to transform atleast a few colleges.. Hope that sounds 
possible??

Regards,
Aanjhan

srid... a lot of ppl (i dont say all but a lot) are interested... they
are just motivated by "money". different ppl have different motivations.
you cant fault 'em all. CEG is probably the best place to do your
engineering. I dont care how you rate the faculty, but the environment
is excellent suitable promote "interest" in their own fields of interest.

The VC bans "cellphones", "t-shirts","jeans","motorcycles" and u want
profs to be in sync with the students.. what a joke. India's largest
technical institute is simply not accepting to technology :(. I am just
hoping that he doenst start banning "internet"... maybe he might even
stop day scholars from browsing. (this is so off topic.. dont even
bother replying)

I would like to add a point here, if the VC *really* wants to ban those 
cellphones then why doesn't he install cellphone signal blocker or 
something in campus area? I seen VC coolly talking on the mobile while a 
seminar is going and next when he comes to the stage he says not to use 
mobile, what kind of example is he setting? (I think the topic is 
seriously deviating now )

Keep your cribs to a minimum.
I know this is an OT post but it does not mean you can crib like
there's no tomorrow.Also keep in mind that you don't who else are part
of this list. CEG teaching staff I'm sure would have some membership.

Looks like the CD or the drive itself is faulty. Change them and see.

Does the the knoppix kernel load up ?
Where exactly do you get the "Segmentation Fault" ?
(try to note note the messages just before the seg fault).

oops.. why does my posts get so misinterpreted.
#1. The VC is common to all the colleges under Anna Univ -- so that
makes 250 + colleges

#2. CEG has one of the best teaching staffs in Anna Univ -- no Cribbing
about them, just about the decisions 'you never know why it happened'.

#3. I am not replying to this topic again :-)

That the abv warning has to be taken seriously is a clear sign of the
malise in our educational system.

Well I tried to load and check in my friends system and the problem 
occurs for me just before the "Autoconfiguring Devices /\" begins.

Couple of things you can do,
1. Replicate the same problem with another Knoppix CD which will
confirm that it's not a media problem(well sort of,your original image
mite itself have problems).

2. Use a different Live Distro to boot and verify if everything is
fine(No hardware issues).

Also, is this a Knoppix DVD or CD ?

download is corrupted somewhere...

I burnt the image on another CD and check it last night it gave same 
problem, both work fine on another system.

I did boot Ubuntu Live CD, works without any problems.
Knoppix CD version, md5 are correct.

Hi all,
    Do Linux desktop systems stop responding when using certain GUI
applications especially multimedia applications or applications that
access HDD/CD/floppy ? I have seen applications stop responding in my
system. It is Athlon XP 2000+ with 256MB DDR RAM and an Asus VIA
motherboard. Is it due to the system fault ?.
    I heard people saying that Linux is very stable and dont crash
like Windows. In what context they say this ? Server or desktop ?

A buggy driver can cause kernel panic thus leading to system crash. I 
have found the buggy driver to be the source of problem most of the 
time. Also what distro are you using. A testing version is not stable.

How can you come to any conclusion with only one
example? Your sample size is just 1.

I use GNU/Linux on embedded, desktops, servers etc. no
problem whatsoever.

Never blame the software if there is no proper
hardware support. 

I already posted this link to Karunya GLUG mailing
list:

http://www.mozillaquest.com/Linux04/Asus_Sucks_Story-01.html

Not sure if their support has changed over the years.

Regards,

SK

May be it is problem with H/W. But I have seen this in my previous
system which was Celeron with a Mercury M/B.

I forgot to mention that the entire system freezes not just a program.
Lot of times I have seen that certain programs are not responding
propely(especially when closing the application) like Nautilus.

Where to get more info on Linux compatible H/W ?.
Why not create a page in wiki about the hardware people have worked
with that goes well with Linux ?.

First, you will need to understand that Linux is not the silver bullet
to end all your woes.

Still with me ?
Good, now you will need to be more specific about your problem.

You have mentioned your system specs,that's a start.
Next, define your problem more clearly, recall the scenario wherein
your Linux system "hung" and explain what happened.

Third, to help you better we will need more information.
Information like:
- What distribution were you using ? (Red Hat/Debian)
- Which Desktop Environment? (GNOME/KDE) ?
- Do you have a swap partition ?
- How much disk space you have allocated for your swap partition?
- Which application hung ?
- What functionality was the application performing ?(Disk I/O or CPU )

Finally,
As I have mentioned Linux is not a Windows-killer.Just by shifting to
Linux you will not attain computing nirvana.When people say "Linux is
stable and does not crash" it's their opinion, similarly you need to
cultivate your own opinion based on your experience with Linux.

It's a long road, welcome to the journey.It might suck at times,but
you'll love every step.

I use Windows as primary desktop ssytem at office and home and I am
not going to give up using Linux. It is a good source to learn and it
helps me in work also. Frequently I test Linux to know whether it fits
my need as a desktop system at home so that I can replace Windows with
different versions/distros. That's how I came here with this question.

Before going to details one scenario I can surely tell is put a crap
CD(preferably a VCD) in the CD drive and access it using mount or try
to copy it using dd or play it using xine. 90% chance is that the
system will stop responding.

What version of the GNOME Desktop Environment ?

I run GNOME 2.10 on a P4 3.0Ghz with 512 MB RAM and I still face
performance issue's.GNOME is bloat,so is KDE.

To trully enjoy GNOME/KDE you will need atleast 256+ Megs of Physical RAM.
Throwing in a 512MB(atleast) swap partition will also help.

Also,
can you post your /etc/hosts file.GNOME makes extensive use of it.

I dont expect that I have to reboot my system.

At house I use OpenSUSE 10.0 and I think it is using GNOME 2.10.

I just wanted to know whether it(system hung) is happening with other
systems because I rearely get chance to work on other Linux systems
other than my own system.

Most if the ILUGC meet announcements happen on the mailing list.
The main website(http://chennailug) rarely gets updated.

The wiki is more active but I'm not sure whether meet announcements
are posted on the wiki.You could dig around :
http://chennailug.org/wiki/

http://chennailug.org/wiki/Events will give you the list of Events
conducted by ILUGC members.

Read the list often and you should be able to get most of the info.

Welcome.You are $HOME now. ;)

There are several ways in ILUGC can help you and your friends.

1.If you feel there are many friends interested, you can organise a
place for talks. Some of us - volunteers from ILUGC - can talk about
the topics you are keen. But a crowd(!) of 5 or more  alone is worth
the trouble.

2.If you assure me attendance of >=10 I will try to arrange
somewhere.

3.Alternatively, we will examine the possibility of a beginners
session in MaFoi also if there is good response.

4.If you are a student, best option will be to organise a
half/full/two day(s) seminar in your college. We will get speakers.
Topics can be chosen after discussion. 

5.Organise a demo day in your college with support of ILUGC.

Following few things I observed, may be of relevance, with respect to
dresscode, cell phones etc. under this thread

1.I saw programme in ndtv/headlines where wipro-bpo has brought dress
regulation to its employees.

2.I went to large-multinational-banks System department. We are not
allowed to use cell phones inside their premises.

3.In Indian Government (at least in Railways where I work) people
attend work in jeans/T-shirts/Dhotis and we have not faced any
regulations.

This is because of security and safety issue's for the lady employees.

Because of their equipment?
To prevent gadgets from sniffing electronic data.
It's possible to have a sniffing program on PDA/smartphone's.

Anto

   Please, you have to know the basics of linux before anythg else. And 
the basic says that.,... to have any linux distro as ur  desktop, u 
shlould have a sound swap space. Its always good to have double the size 
of ur RAM or even greater as ur swap space.So for 128 MB RAM or so .. u 
shld have 256 MB swap space.
Generally its good to have 512 MB or more as swap space. Once  you have  
a swap space, your system is good, fast and reliable. I am using linux 
from 7 years and i can assure its better than windows.

Toufeeq y do u confuse a new linux user with ur complicated situation. 
KDE and Gnome are bloat if we do not give them proper hardware support.

Also to add.. the accessing CDROM in linux will never hang ur system 
unless and until u have a bad cdrom / bad configuration or bad CD. Mail 
us ur cdrom drive model. To figure out ur problem in cdrom access.. 
please use strace and mail us it.

Government or private, I think thats how every employer should be. As long
as it is not an hazardous environment, what clothes to wear should be a

Who said so? You can run GNU/Linux without any swap
space.

This was applicable to old, ancient hardware. It
doesn't apply to today's hardware.

Hehe. KDE and Gnome don't directly deal with hardware.
Its the X server and the video driver that has to deal
with the hardware, directly.

Arnold, the biggest problem in linux is that all the everythg in linux 
is written by ppl like us. The companies still dont provide support for 
linux. so it may have bugs in general, but its way too minute for us to 
figure it out .. ;)
 
Generally wht happens in mounting the cdrom in linux is the time taken 
for the seek command. During the mount of the drive, the linux drivers 
does a seek on the drive. The seek is done for various position to check 
the actual size of the cdrom written and other details. Generally seek 
happens for the positon of

0, 512, 1024, 3072, 8192  and so on.....

Now in case if ur CD is in good condition, the seek gets executed pretty 
faster and thus u dont see much time lag. But if in case CD is not 
proper then the seek command will take hell lot of time. These  many 
seek will lierally hang ur system as the system resources will fully be 
utilised for the seek command. And thus u see ur system hung.

Please note that this will happen only if the cd is not corrupted fully 
nor its fully readable... thus confusing the system and hence panic.

Subject: [Ilugc] Firefox cache
Message-ID: <e0900f3e0601200431p37553f4bw6fcb8df9ae2af88@mail.gmail.com>

In Firefox, I've allocated the cache size to some 25MB. But, i think
the page is being loaded all over from the net everytime. Whereas
opera does excellent caching of images and even pages. When I press
the back button of the browser, opera would load the previous page
just immediately from cache whereas firefox again loads the page from
net. If i have a page full of images, opera doesnt load all them from
the net everytime. How to tweak firefox to do better caching as opera
does? What are the variables for that in about:config?

browser.cache.check_doc_frequency           3
browser.cache.disk.capacity                        25000
browser.cache.disk.enable                           true
browser.cache.memory.enable                     true
network.http.use-cache                                true

Any other variable to be modified??

You should set it to 2.

0 - Firefox only checks once per browser session.
1 - Firefox checks every time a page is viewed.
2 - Firefox never checks (i.e. it always uses the
version stored locally in your browser cached). 
3 - (the default) Firefox checks at automatically
determined intervals.

My stress in "for desktop users u should have a sound swap space... "  
............. stmt was on to have "sound"  swap space ......... becoz 
the desktop user always keep trying new stuff in linux. Probably i shld

its always good.

It was the norm several years ago to have 2 x RAM swap space, when the
average memory of a workstation was 128 or 256 MB. Nowadays, computers
come with 1GB or more memory, and swap space is almost obsolete.

I have run Slackware without swap on 128mb RAM and it worked but it was 
very very slow as the ram was getting thrashed :(

> My stress in "for desktop users u should have a sound swap space... "  

Generally 1GB is enough for experimenting purpose if you have loads of 
hdd space. I would suggest everyone to experiment with their swap size 
to settle to a value if they have got the time :)

I've tried with some values. when i had 128mb ram, any swap space less
than 500mb caused my system to drawl when i used fedora. There was no
big difference in speed between having 750mb and 1 gb swap. Then, when
i got an extra 256 mb ram (ie., 384 mb total), there was no remarkable
difference between having 500mb and 750 mb. Whereas, when i did my
project at IISC, where the systems had 1.25 gb ram, having any swap
above 500mb made the system slower. So, from the above, i feel that
when u have a ram of above 1 gb, having a minimum amount of swap (
around 128 mb or 256 mb) would do. but when the ram is below 512mb,
750mb - 1gb would be good. All this is not based on any metrics, but
just an intuition. Plz do comment on this.

i agree. Only one thing - if the person breaching etiquette is a 
newbie, we should gently educate him offlist first. We lose ppl 
sometimes when we rebuke them onlist - our country is such that 
public criticism is considered shameful, and until a person is 
firmly hooked, we should refrain from flaming.

i belong to the obsolete - 256 MB, but use swapoff on boot up, and

if anyone is still with this thread... i did try out binand's procedure... i
happens that my cable was straight... so were the ethernet cards on one of
the machines "smart"? surprises me coz my laptop is a low end acer aspire
and i got a cheap ethernet card for my desktop for something like 250 Rs. so
is this "smart behaviour" the de-facto standard these days?

it moves on...

Greetings,

MoM, Saturday,  21st January 2006,

We started at 1530 hrs. Initially we discussed about S5 presentation system.
Then we discussed about the CPAN panel, and packaging of perl modules.
Link to slides: http://users.kaski-net.net/~deepan/blank/perlmodules.html

At 1600 hrs Vamsee started his lectures on Ruby  ( "From Scratch to AJAX") .
The room was flooded with Ruby hackers. He initially spoke about installing
Rails. Then elucidated the simplicity of Ruby with an example. He
demonstrated the default web interface available to populate the database.
Then he spoke on AJAX. He showed us the example of google suggest.

Vamsee invited everyone to join the Chennai Ruby hackers group (Chennai.rb)
. http://groups.google.com/group/chennairb

We finished at 1745 hrs. Hope to meet you all in the next meet at IITM on
28th January, Saturday.
Thanks.

opera does excellent caching of images and even pages. When I press


which version of firefox do you use? the latest 1.5 release specifically has
a very fast back feature just like opera does. further, in many cases,
ironically the rendering ends up being the bottleneck rather than the
network. in such cases again, i would suggest switching to 1.5 as mozilla's
rendering engine (gecko) has undergone major changes and is much faster
now...

true... with a 512 MB system, swap is hardly used, but an occasional
openoffice, some versions of firefox left running overnight do push your
system to using swap. for that matter, having a swap always acts as some
safeguard especially when you use CVS code quite a bit (like I do), and are
likely to hit at some memory leak. over time, I have learnt to find other
uses for swap though :) one is mounting /tmp over tmpfs (I know that there
are opponents for this idea, but works well for me) which could indirectly
uses the swap. the second use is for software suspend (Suspend2 can work
without a swap partition I guess, but it doesn't work for me as yet).

it moves on..

PS: For people who use "swap monsters" like openoffice quite frequently, try
the "swap prefetching" enabled kernel (ck patchset) if you are hit by the
"system-crawls-after-exiting-oo" syndrome. It really works!

What of guys who work for the big corporates that do not allow access to the
web or other mail services AND also do not have a web connection at home!
Would not barring them go against the ILUGC goal of getting as many people
on the bandwagon as possible? Is is not being elitist!!

While one should be encouraged to avoid breaking the list guidelines, when
one is not in a position to comply, perhaps a benign attitude from other
list members would serve our purpose better! After all, they are only
guidelines and not regulations. And legal disclaimers, albeit non-sensical,
does not cause bitterness!

Message-ID: <7bf1bec50601212032m47b1f155nd4fdb8119f83b991@mail.gmail.com>

I read this<http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/01/09/jaron-lanier/the-gory-antigora/>article
by a Jaron Lanier (self taught.. no academic qualifications) where
he questions the idea of 'file system' thus:

"An example of the principle of lock-in from the technical sphere is the
idea of the computer file. Prior to sometime in the mid-1980s, there were
influential voices in computer science opposing the idea of the file because
it would lead to file incompatibility. Ted Nelson, the inventor of the idea
of linked digital content, and Jef Raskin, initiator of the Macintosh
project at Apple, both held the view that there should be a giant field of
elemental data without file boundaries. Since UNIX, Windows, and even the
Macintosh?as it came out the door after a political struggle?incorporated
files, the idea of the file has become digitally entrenched.

We teach files to undergraduates as if we were teaching them about photons.
Indeed, I can more readily imagine physicists asking us to abandon the
photon in a hundred years than computer scientists abandoning the file in a
thousand. Whether the idea of files is of any consequence is an
imponderable. Files have become too fundamental to reconsider. But other
candidates for lock-in can and must be considered."

I too had assumed that a file system is an absolute fundamental immutable
requirement for operating systems. This view by Lanier is new to me. Does
the computer science syllabi inform students about such alternate beliefs?
Does anyone here have knowledge about these systems, their pros and cons?

You can always subscribe to the list.
Being part of the list is not a problem.
But,you can't reply with a DISCLAIMER.

I've subscribed to ILUGC list from both my corporate id and my personal id.
I never post using my corporate id.If you go through corporate policy
of any "big" company it clearly mentions that you cannot use corporate
e-mail for personal use *and* when you send an e-mail from that id the
IP contained within that e-mail message belongs to the company.

Now take the last sentence and apply that to a FOSS list like ILUGC
and you might see where the problem lies.It's not just the DISCLAIMER.

dont forget, most corporates ban employees from using their 
corporate email ids for personal use. If you feel it is necessary 
for your job to post to the list, convince your boss to exempt 
posts to the list from having disclaimers attached. Otherwise dont 
expect us to support something that is illegal

Would it be possible to make mailman scrub these disclaimers like how it
does to non-text attachments..
There seems to be some pattern in such disclaimers..
Or perhaps it is not right to do it as it is a legal disclaimer?

Automatically munching mails send by others might not be appropriate 
thing to do automatically. Setting mailman to auto reject based on regex 
patterns with a stock explanation might be better.

Hi..
    I am using RedHat 9 (kernel 2.4.xx). I have a Tata Indicom broadband
connection with a Connexant BIPAC 7000 USB modem.
I read somebody's post on this mailing list suggesting to download this
modem's drivers from its official site

http://www.billion.uk.com/support/download/fd/fd1.htm#fd103

I tried to execute the instructions given for this manual from the above
site. But the modem's light does not blink.
I am also thinking of installing another version of Linux with a kernel
2.6.xx.
Please can somebody suggest how to configure this connection on either
RedHat 9, Mandrake 10.1 and above OR Fedora Core 3 and above.

Please help... I am trying this from many days

Thank you..

I work for one such corporate. Hence I use a different address to post here.

And if someone is in such dire straits that he/she is not allowed
Internet access at office and can't afford even a dialup at home or
some time at the neighbourhood cybercafe, then theoretically even a
computer is unaffordable :)

Nope, it is just being considerate to the other list members.

Well, it stands to reason that any company which puts such a
disclaimer will also have an AUP for its employees, which has clause
forbidding the employee from using the company-provided email ID for
personal purposes.

Further still, said company can theoretically go ahead and try to
implement these quasi-legal threats. We can argue that such threats
hold no value whatsover, but injunctions and stay orders come first,
judgements come much, much later. :)

What did you try? 

Follow the Readme.txt instructions in
bipac-7000Linuxstandard.zip.

Where does it fail, and where does it succeed?

This modem does work with linux, but I doubt if you can do it with 2.4
series of kernel.

Visit http://accessrunner.sourceforge.net/

and follow the instructions given there. You might have to recompile the
kernel.

I tried the instructions in the README. But after typing
# ifconfig hsb0 up
# dcpcd hsb0

The modem light does not blink.
I am also thinking of installing Mandrake 10.1 to make things easier.
Do you think I should install Mandrake 10.1 or Fedora Core 3?

Thanks a lot for you help

if you are fairly new to linux - mandrake is the way to go. Also if 
you are installing linux for the purpose of *using* your computer 
with least hassles, go for mandrake. If you are installing to play 
around with linux itself, then you could try FC, or debain or 
gentoo

What happened when you tried the instructions prior to
the above? 

Please provide detailed error/output messages for all
the steps that you followed, so we can find out where
it failed.

Hi..
     This is what I tried..

#tar zxvpf USBNET_E2_LINUX_062802_REL1.7.tar.gz

dhcpcd                      hsbeth.c     Makefile  usbsndcm.o

These are the contents of the directory e2source

BlDefs.h     customer.h  hasbani.h  kmod.c    Readme.txt  usbsndcm.h

Then I ran the following command from the directory e2source

 #cp CnxE2Fw.bin /etc/CnxE2Fw.bin

Then I ran the following command from the directory 'e2'

[root@localhost e2]# insmod e2.o
Warning: loading e2.o will taint the kernel: no license
  See http://www.tux.org/lkml/#export-tainted for information about

Module e2 loaded, with warnings

After this , I tried the following commands

       #ifconfig hsb0 up
        #dhcpcd -n hsb0
But the modem light is not blinking.
Should I install Mandrake 10.1. I have heard that it has support for USB modems.

Thanks a lot

Sorry.. I forgot to mention this

I ran the following command from directory e2.

# ifconfig hsb0 up

and it gave the following message

SIOCSIFFLAGS: Resource temporarily unavailable

and then this command from 'e2'
# dhcpcd -n hsb0
bash: dhcpcd: command not found


Thanks..

Post output of:

 /sbin/lsmod
 /sbin/ifconfig -a
 
> #dhcpcd -n hsb0

With a dial-up modem, you dial using kppp or wvdial,
not use dhcpcd. dhcpcd is mostly used in dymanically
assigning IP addresses for ethernet-based cards from a
DHCP server/router.

Driver support is dependant on the Linux kernel you
are using. 

If you use Mandrake 10.1, you will be using a 2.6
kernel, which is definitely recommended. Please follow
the suggestions by Mohammed Riyaz as mentioned below:

The modem light starts to blink only when the firmware has been loaded
into the modem. For this you need hotplug with firmware loading support.
Infact I think you will find this only in fedora core 2 onwards (by
default). So getting it to work with anything lesser than that would be
a whole lot of trouble. You probably will have to reinstall hotplug and
all that.

It is best to try with fedora core 4, you will have the hotplug support
and you will have to recompile the kernel just once, with 
http://accessrunner.sourceforge.net/driver.shtml

once that is done, you will get the lights to blink. This can also be
confirmed by looking at dmesg.

And morever dont try with the drivers on the billion website.. they just
wont work. Atleast they didnt work for me. The access runner website has
newer drivers and atlest these guys know what they are doing, unlike the
manufactures who give some .o file just to say "Linux supported" on
their catalouge.

Ok, you are using a 2.6 kernel. Good.

You only have a UHCI host controller driver. You need
to have:

1. usbcore.ko support. Either its support is compiled
in in your kernel, or its not loaded. Try doing:

 modprobe usbcore

2. usbserial.ko support. Either its support is
compiled in in your kernel or its not loaded.

 modprobe usbserial

If support is not enabled, either built-in or as a
module, you need to recompile the kernel.

3. Drivers for your USB-to-serial cable.

SK

I agree that firefox 1.5 is leaps ahead in caching system compared to 
older ones but the memory usage is quite high compared to older 
releases. I find it difficult to run it in the old systems.

U can try opera if u want to have a light weight browser with a good
caching system.

Hi Riyaz..

Thank you for the information. I was going to install Mandrake 10.1 or
Mandriva 2006.
Some ppl told me that it has accessrunner drivers and usb support. But
wanted to know from you whether I should install Fedora Core 4 or Mandriva
2006?

Thanks for all the help!!

is it? though i am not that hard-pressed wrt memory requirements, i do run a
`ps avx` every now and then, mainly for firefox. didn't notice much of a
change during the transit from 1.0.x to 1.5 (well, it is true though that in
both cases, the memory needed is high :) ). dunno whether the others over
here found something similar to what you observed.

btw... i haven't tried this... but if you are still bent on using firefox
despite the memory limitations, do try tweaking
browser.cache.memory.{capacity,enable}... could solve or atleast alleviate
your problem :)

it moves on...

With the new Gecko 1.8 runtime, all Mozilla applications (Firefox,
Thunderbird), they try to use the common/single instance of GRE and
thus saving memory.  So, if you're running more than one Mozilla app
like Firefox, Thunderbird, Sunbird, you may find it the applications
use lesser memory than before.

Yes. Thanks for the correction.

In this 20min, Only 10min will be effectively used for this 1st
lightning. So in feature, we can make it really lightning.

I agree that firefox 1.5 is leaps ahead in caching system compared to 
older ones but the memory usage is quite high compared to older 
releases. I find it difficult to run it in the old systems.

U can try opera if u want to have a light weight browser with a good
caching system.

Hi Riyaz..

Thank you for the information. I was going to install Mandrake 10.1 or
Mandriva 2006.
Some ppl told me that it has accessrunner drivers and usb support. But
wanted to know from you whether I should install Fedora Core 4 or Mandriva
2006?

Thanks for all the help!!

is it? though i am not that hard-pressed wrt memory requirements, i do run a
`ps avx` every now and then, mainly for firefox. didn't notice much of a
change during the transit from 1.0.x to 1.5 (well, it is true though that in
both cases, the memory needed is high :) ). dunno whether the others over
here found something similar to what you observed.

btw... i haven't tried this... but if you are still bent on using firefox
despite the memory limitations, do try tweaking
browser.cache.memory.{capacity,enable}... could solve or atleast alleviate
your problem :)

it moves on...

With the new Gecko 1.8 runtime, all Mozilla applications (Firefox,
Thunderbird), they try to use the common/single instance of GRE and
thus saving memory.  So, if you're running more than one Mozilla app
like Firefox, Thunderbird, Sunbird, you may find it the applications
use lesser memory than before.

Yes. Thanks for the correction.

In this 20min, Only 10min will be effectively used for this 1st
lightning. So in feature, we can make it really lightning.

Subject: [Ilugc] fetchmail, catchall, sendmail
Message-ID: <BAY109-DAV5AF3FA50F6069B0B35779C2130@phx.gbl>

Hi,

I have a linux box with many users. On a remote system i have a catchall 
email. I want to fetchmail from the catchall and distribute it to local 
users. I want this work with sendmail. I have got the fectchmail download 
emails from catchall on the remote for user root. But it is not distributing 
to local users. say i send an email to praveen@mydomain.com .. it goes to 
the catchall. now i fetch to my local via fetchmail. The email is 
downloaded, but it goes to root instead of to the local user praveen. I 
can't have a .fetchmailrc for every user as many are being added and deleted 
often.

Is there a way we can do it dynamically? or with just one configuration file 
or something and it needs to be routed after being fetched.

I know this is a common problem. I've searched in the net and did not find a 
working solution with fetchmail and sendmail. I don't want to move to 
postfix or getmail or whatever. Can anyone help me with this? If possible, 
can you also give me a sample configuration so I can try it out?

Thanks in advance,
Abilash Praveen M

Post your fetchmail config file here. Something like

poll remote proto pop3 user whatever password whatever is * here

is all that is required, to make fetchmail aware of multidrop mailboxes.

never use a catchall. repeat after me, never use a catchall. Put 
forwarders for all users to a common mailbox and fetch from there

> I want to fetchmail from the catchall and

use this fetchmailrc:

poll yourdomain.com proto POP3 no dns envelope Envelope-To
        timeout 90
        user commonbox@yourdomain.com password xxxxxx to * here
        limit 500000

Looks like it goes to postmaster@localhost rather than to praveen@localhost

Any ideas?

Zimbra have a demo on their website.poke around.

i dont know how your sendmail is configured. I have been using this 
fetchmailrc from 1996 to date without change, first with sendmail 
and now with postfix. Is your local intranet server also named 
mydomain.com or does it have a separate name?

i dont know how your sendmail is configured. I have been using this
fetchmailrc from 1996 to date without change, first with sendmail
and now with postfix. Is your local intranet server also named
mydomain.com or does it have a separate name?

The local intranet server is name subdomain.mydomain.com. I've also enabled 
mydomain.com, localhost, localhost.localdomain, subdomain.mydomain.com as 
local domains for sendmail. Please advise.

Drop the "envelope Envelope-To" part.

I have FC4 running.I have two question.

1)
We have very large c programme running in  konsole.(aerospace appilication)
The programme will display lot of data in the terminal we have to look it.
In some times, we have to stop the process in the mid way and see the result.
For this operation,Is there any command to stop the process and reiterate
the process again.
If we press CRTL-Z and #bg resumes the process single time only.

2)If we alter the coding and compiled it.And again we have start it
where we left.
Is it possible?

So any idea.

Thanks.

You can redirect the output to another file and watch it
using something like

#tail -f <filename>

Upto my knowledge not possible in c.Possible in a language
where you have the source split into seperate modules.

hi all,
       I have been running FC1 for the past 2 years and the baby served me real well. 
I wanna try out the 2.6 Kernel (better late than never).Decided to go for fedora core 4.
I will be thankful if anyone can help me get the CDs.I stay near Annanagar. If you can get me the Cds ,please contact me off-list.

My M/C configuration is as below:

Processor : Pentium III (500MHz)
RAM       : 256 MB
Graphics  : Intel 810 chipset (Mercury motherboard)  
sound card : C-Media
I have DataOne broadband (Sterlite modem)
I am planning to buy an 80 GB hard drive

I request the members of the group to enlighten me if there are any know problems running 2.6 kernel (for that matter FC4) in this configuration.
Also please tell me if there are any problems with X - server configuration on an i810 chipset in FC4.

The reason why i am asking this is because i have a perfectly working FC1 box.
I wanted to try out the 2.6 kernel for sometime (also i am interested in chking out FC4) and dont wanna end up with a box not as responsive as FC1 (for my configuration)


Thanks in advance
Harris

I am sorry but i will have to cancel on this. My college rescheduled an
exam for saturday, so I might not be able to make it. I'd like to do it
at the next GLV session.

No problems.

Again, none.i810 chipset is well supported.

Depends on what you want to run.FC4 ships with KDE 3.4(?) and GNOME
2.1x .Both the above Desktop Environments are pretty
memory-intensive.256M of physical RAM meets the
requirement(nearly).Throw in Firefox and you might hit high swap
memory usage easily.

If all you want is the 2.6 kernel, download it and compile it from
http://kernel.org

You need to dump your data structures to disk and restore them when
you restart.  This assumes that you have not modified your application's
data structures when you change your code.

High level languages such as Perl/Python offer Freeze-Thaw/Pickle
to easily save/reload complex data structures to/from disk.  Oh! Java
supports persistence very elegantly.

If you are using C, take a look at the Condor project's checkpointing
library.  See
    http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/checkpointing.html

Condor uses a Unix signal handler to checkpoint C applications. Keep
in mind that you cannot checkpoint an application while executing
"critical areas", eg. mid-way between data structure updates.

On the plus, Fedora Extras ships with XFCE, fluxbox etc and 2.6.x kernel 
performance is generally pretty good.

Thats going to be a pain on a 2.4 system with all the naunces of user 
space dependencies. Better copy over data and do a fresh installation of 
a distribution that supports 2.6.x natively

Sorry, my bad.  For some reason, I was imagining adding .forwards in
home dirs.  I got my boxes changed over to forwarders in the virtual
user tables ages ago.

That also reminds me, catchall has another bad side-effect:
Sendmail/MTA cannot bounce bad addresses.  Senders will receive
no indication when they mistype email addresses, and worse still,
recipients will not get the email either.  It sinks into a black hole.

Hi all,
             i got new usb/Ethernet adsl modem from bsnl, they have
given me the driver for GNU/LINUX, but i dont know how to install and
configure it, i dont have NIC Ethernet card so i have to use the usb.
is it possible to use the USB modem in GNU//LINUX? Have anyone
configured the usb adsl modem?

thanks in advance

That doesn't happen, at least theoretically. There are two MTAs
involved - the first, on the catchall box, will of course accept all
mails for @foo.com and won't bounce any. But the second MTA, to which
a multidrop pop3 client like fetchmail will forward the email to, will
notice that the email's recipient is bad and will bounce it.

The drawback is that you need to accept the mail first, and then
bounce it (much like qmail).

Subject: [Ilugc] Problem regarding connecting httpd and tomcat...
Message-ID: <43D79C6F.8020300@wipro.com>


Hello everybody,
For the past two days i have been trying to connect httpd-2.2.0 with 
apache-tomcat-5.5.14 using jakarta-tomcat-connectors-1.2.15-src...

But i faced a lot of problems in connecting it..First of all this mod_jk 
connector..i built it and here is the log that i got in the webserver

[Wed Jan 25 21:01:36 2006] [notice] Apache/2.2.0 (Unix) mod_jk/1.2.15 
configured -- resuming normal operations

that went fine ...

in the server.xml file of tomcat i added this line

<Listener className="org.apache.jk.config.ApacheConfig" 
modJk="/usr/local/apache2/modules/mod_jk.so" />

.....Then in httpd .conf i added the following .

LoadModule jk_module modules/mod_jk.so
    # Where to find workers.properties
    JkWorkersFile conf/workers.properties
    # Where to put jk logs
    JkLogFile     logs/mod_jk.log
    # Set the jk log level [debug/error/info]
    JkLogLevel    info
    # Select the log format
    JkLogStampFormat "[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y] "
    # JkOptions indicate to send SSL KEY SIZE,
    JkOptions     +ForwardKeySize +ForwardURICompat -ForwardDirectories
    # JkRequestLogFormat set the request format
    JkRequestLogFormat     "%w %V %T"
    # Send servlet for context /examples to worker named worker1
    JkMount  /servlets-examples/servlet/* default
    # Send JSPs  for context /examples to worker named worker1
    JkMount  /jsp-examples/*.jsp default

and gave the alias as
 Alias /jsp-examples 
"/home/karthik/apache-tomcat-5.5.14/webapps/jsp-examples/"
                                                                                

    Alias /servlets-examples 
"/home/karthik/apache-tomcat-5.5.14/webapps/servlets-examples/"

i also gave the directory permission as

<Directory "/home/karthik/apache-tomcat-5.5.14/webapps/jsp-examples/">
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Allow from all
</Directory>

and finally gave this

Include /home/karthik/apache-tomcat-5.5.14/conf/auto/mod_jk.conf

finally when i started the server with

http://10.116.21.215/jsp-examples/

i get this error


  Forbidden

You don't have permission to access /jsp-examples/ on this server.

Additionally, a 403 Forbidden error was encountered while trying to use 
an ErrorDocument to handle the request.

Did i miss something ...

No need to be so harsh.

Krishna, this is *not* the forum to ask this question.  Read

Hi Karthik,

With tomcat 5.5 and mod_jk you can very well use the autoconf
properties. Just google around for auto conf with tomcat and apache.
But if you insisted in doing this manually, I don't think you need to
provide the alias and the directory directives in httpd.conf. I think
the problem is that apache is overriding the JKMount with the alias
directives.

I have done this a couple of times and I am very sure you don't need
to alias the tomcat pages in httpd.conf

Do post if your problem is resolved.

Hi,
Install an ethernet card  to connect to the modem. It is easier.
Configuring USB is bit diffcult in linux. Also they say ethernet
performance is better than usb (According to both Airtel & BSNL). It
is very easy to configure in linux.  Good quality ethernet cards cost
about Rs350/ max in Ritchie street.

Hi friend,

This is not the forum for discussing Windows. But the situation might have
forced you to look for all avenues.

Look at the following URL and you should be able to reset ur win xp password
in two minutes

http://www.petri.co.il/forgot_administrator_password.htm

Next time onwards dont' post ur Windows problems/doubts in this.

Hello,

I am one of the developers of Arudius - a live CD Linux distro targeting information security professionals. The 
CD has a large collection of security tools and a very small footprint (210MB) so it fits on a mini-CD, thus it 
can load its tools completely into RAM and run them very fast. In addition to this security-related Linux 
distribution, we also developed a NetBSD live CD focusing on the non-security community. It is called NeWBIE (or 
simply Newbie). This acronym is pronounced just like the word "newbie" and stands for 
(Ne)tBSD (W)are (B)urned (I)n (E)conomy, a naming convention similar to the one used for the well-known FreeSBIE 
CD. Newbie caters to the desktop-user (i.e. with applications for web browsing, chat, multimedia, document editing, 
etc) but will also serve as a core for creating a NetBSD-based live CD for network security auditing just like 
Arudius (see the  website). We are also in the process of developing a DragonflyBSD version of NeWBIE.
The goal of both CDs is to promote the usage of Linux/BSD and hopefully serve as useful tools for people who
need that kind of software.
We would appreciate it if you try out the CDs and give us some feedback on how we can improve them (i.e 
configuration, install additional software, etc). If you find any of the CDs to be useful, please mention them on 
your site or post a link to the homepage - http://arudius.sourceforge.net
Thank you very much for your attention and if you have any questions feel free to send an email to haidut@gmail.com

Haidut

Subject: [Ilugc] fetching ip address from kernel space
Message-ID: <72a9b0620601260359sc842dbbn720537936035cb82@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

    What is the best way to get the IP address of an interface in
kernel space? I tried googling and I got the following method.

1) Get the device pointer using dev_get_by_name.(say Dev)
2) Dev->ip_ptr gives the pointer to ip related info. type cast it to
in_device. assign it toDevIpPtr.
3) DevIpPtr->in_ifaddr->ifa_local gives the ip address.

My code goes like this.


struct net_device  *pIntf;
struct in_device      *IpHdr;

pIntf = dev_get_by_name ("eth0");

    IpHdr = pIntf->ip_ptr;
    printk("\n local = %x, Address =%x" , (IpHdr->ifa_list)->ifa_local,
            (IpHdr->ifa_list)->ifa_address);

On compilation, last 2 line throws an error,
"dereferencing pointer to incomplete type"

I would like 2 know
1)why this error
2)is there any other better way to get the interface address. (I don't
want the alias addresses.)

Thanks and Regards
Muneer CH

That typically means you haven't included the header file in which the
struct is defined.

Oops!!! u fixed it Binand. Succefully compiled and got ouput as my
requirement!! I was looking at that boring error since after noon.

Thanks a lot Binand

I guess that is the best way to get the IP of the interface. But that
structure (ifa_list)being a link list, i guess all the ip addresses
including the aliases are stored in that. Let me try to find out how
to give a kick to aliased ip addresses (if there is)!!

segmentations faults have got nothing to do with your ram.  MALLOC_CHECK_ is
the environment variable that decides how much  of memory violation your
operating system will tolerate. It also depends on the dynamic nature of
inputs that the program is subjected to. The version of GCC or CC or G++
that you used to compile your program will also affect how soon you would
get segmentation faults. Every new version of GCC discovers hidden errors in
old programs. when MALLOC_CHECK_ is set to 0 any detected heap corruption is
silently ignored.

you could try using valgrind or gdb to get more information about the bug.

really? i had the same problem for some 2 years... random segfaults and
crashes... worse was the fact that i was moving from windows to linux at
that time, and linux used to crash more than windows, and this even made me
lose trust on the os for some time! serendipitously happened to run the
memtest86 shipped with fedora and found memory errors. what it needed after
that was just the badram patch... (i reasoned out later that, ironically,
linux crashed more because it utilized the available RAM more :) )

dude... you *do* get a segfault when a memory error flips a bit in the
address where you have a pointer stored!

debian is generally stable (unless u use the unstable strain), and if you
get random errors in many apps, then there is a good possibility that the
bug is in the kernel (if you use a custom kernel) or the hardware.

memtest is a boot time program and doesnt depend on the OS (why talk abt the
distro then!)... all you need is a bootable iso with the program (fc2 used
to ship it in... i dunno if this is the case now.. i've stopped using fc)...
memtest cannot solve the hardware problem! memtest can isolate regions of
your memory which are erroneous though... you will have to use the "badram"
patch to the kernel to pass these faulty address ranges at boot time, so
that the kernel locks these pages early on in the boot process, and no
process or the kernel ends up using them....

it moves on...

Boston Massachusetts, USA - Wednesday January 25, 2006. At the
ceremony for the 2006 Free Software Awards, Richard Stallman presented
Andrew Tridgell with the award for the advancement of free software.

Andrew "Tridge" Tridgell was recognized for his work as originator and
developer of the Samba project. Samba reverse-engineered Microsoft's
version of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which is used for
file-sharing and print services. This software enables free operating
systems to fit into Microsoft-based environments, encouraging greater
use and adoption of free software. Samba has been implemented on
millions of servers throughout the world. Tridge also released rsync,
a highly respected remote file-distribution system, and contributed
code to the Linux kernel.

During 2005, Tridge wrote a free software client to interoperate with
BitKeeper, a proprietary revision control system used at the time by
the Linux kernel developers. His reverse-engineering efforts led
BitMover Inc. to remove permission for the use of BitKeeper, paving
the way for a free software replacement. The Linux kernel is now being
developed using a revision control system called Git, begun by Linus
Torvalds and licensed under the GPL.

Every year, three finalists are nominated for the award by the free
software community. This year's other two finalists were Harmut Pilch,
recognized as founder of Foundation for a Free Information
Infrastructure (FFII) and for his leadership during the fight against
the Software Patent Directive in Europe, and Theodore T'so, recognized
for his work on file systems and the Linux kernel.  Winners of the
Free Software Award
   
    * 2005 Andrew Tridgell
    * 2004 Theo de Raadt
    * 2003 Alan Cox
    * 2002 Lawrence Lessig
    * 2001 Guido van Rossum
    * 2000 Brian Paul
    * 1999 Miguel de Icaza
    * 1998 Larry Wall

This year's Award Committee: Peter H. Salus (chair), Richard Stallman,
Alan Cox (winner 2003), Lawrence Lessig (winner 2002), Guido van
Rossum (winner 2001), Frederic Couchet, Jonas Oberg, Hong Feng, Bruce
Perens, Raju Mathur, Suresh Ramasubramanian, Enrique A. Chaparro, Ian
Murdock.

The Free Software Foundation sponsors the annual Award for the
Advancement of Free Software, to recognize and honor those that have
made a great contribution to the progress and development of Free
Software (free as in freedom as defined in the Free Software
Definition), through activities that accord with the spirit of
software freedom.

Any kind of activity could be eligible---writing software, writing
documentation, publishing software, even journalism---but whatever the
activity, we want to recognize long-term central contributions to the
development of the world of software freedom. "Accord with the spirit"
means, for example, that software, manuals or collections of them
(online or on CD) must be entirely free. Work done commercially is
eligible, but we give this award to individuals, not to companies,
organizations, or teams. You can support the award and the work of the
Free Software Foundation here.[1]

You have to make your Linux system to use LDAP for user and group
information. If you are using Red Hat based distro use authconfig
command or refer your distro's manual on how to do this. for Samba +
LDAP integration refer the following documentation.

does it mean that languages that require less or no information
regarding memory allocation wont crash atleast due to seg faults...
correct if i am wrong...isnt effective memory management of various
languages in this order

python > java > c++ > c

does python's byte-compiled nature hav anyhtin to do with it or is
python the odd one out here in the first place...

> Every new version of GCC discovers hidden errors in old programs

er...forgive my ignorance..i didnt get that...what if i dont get any
segfaults today in a binary executable...and tomorrow my pc decides to
turn on me by giving segfaults...where does the problem lie then? its
obviously the ram..isnt it?..please do note that i m referring to a
precompiled binary and not some binary which i compile from source..

Linux poses a real challenge for those with a taste for late-nighthacking (and/or conversations with God).- Matt Welsh

Linux is not user-friendly. It _is_ user-friendly. It is not ignorant-friendly and idiot-friendly.-Unknown

Waving away a cloud of smoke, I look up, and am blinded by a bright, whitelight. It's God. No, not Richard Stallman, or Linus Torvalds, but God. In a booming voice, He says: "THIS IS A SIGN. USE LINUX, THE FREE UNIX SYSTEM FOR THE 386." -Matt Welsh

Microsoft isn't evil, they just make really crappy operating systems.

Well, no! That is why I asked. This has not been /.ed, neither can I
get something from Google... even the Gentoo Weekly Newsletters after
Jan 9th do not mention this, so I'm not sure.

Hope we hear some confirmation soon.

Linux poses a real challenge for those with a taste for late-nighthacking (and/or conversations with God).- Matt Welsh

Linux is not user-friendly. It _is_ user-friendly. It is not ignorant-friendly and idiot-friendly.-Unknown

Waving away a cloud of smoke, I look up, and am blinded by a bright, whitelight. It's God. No, not Richard Stallman, or Linus Torvalds, but God. In a booming voice, He says: "THIS IS A SIGN. USE LINUX, THE FREE UNIX SYSTEM FOR THE 386." -Matt Welsh

Microsoft isn't evil, they just make really crappy operating systems.

Do people send this e-mail or is it automatically sent by some trojan
or something like a Outlook dll hijack(similar to the IE dll hijack) ?

If _people_ send such e-mail, Admin, please prevent them from posting
to the list(they can still receive mail) for a temporary period.They
can post again after say a month's "post-ban".

I know a permanent ban is a little extreme considering everyone get's
spam, but spam on a tech-list is a strict no-no.

these iPod sites require you to introduce (read 'provide spam targets') them
to some `n' friends, for you to make use of the offer... the list address
becomes an easy target...

If this "i-pod website" is asking for "n" e-mail addresses and the
person knowing this is giving the list address as a terget then
doesn't it warrant a BAN ?

i would be tempted to say "yes" unless the member convinces the list that it
was indeed a mistake... (i know some other sites which offer to look up your
gmail/yahoo/msn/orkut/... accounts and add the email addresses... they
usually provide a checkboxed list of all the addresses with the default
being ticked... in such a case, it warrants careful exclusion of such mail
addresses, and still you can miss out on unchecking the list address in the
long list...)

it moves on...

Hey,

this has been a regular event these days. lotta spammers around. i suggest
we have to be proactive. how bout writing some opensource tool that could
work in coherence to the mail forwarding system (mailman) and intelligently
eliminate spam !!....

ur opinion ??

i suppose this is one of the major with all such groups and many are
litreally spammed out. so such a tool would be of great contribution to the
community esp open source !!

Hello Friends,

In the last meet at IITM, i have invited some school students. I am much
supported by the members of ilugc idea to have a separate session on linux
to school students. I request Mr.Vamsee and Mr Ashokan pitchai to provide
place to conduct the session. In between i can pool some interested school
students for such a session. Members can frame the itenary/agenda for the
workshop. If sizable audience of ~20 students will be great for such a meet.
I request each one of our lug  chennai residing members to propogate about
the workshop to the known students.

Thanking you,

Hi Varun,
Great work!
Just now tried it.

Is it possible to make a pluggin to type tamil directly into the gaim
message box?
Is it possible to scan the key strokes and print them directly as
tamil unicode as we type ?

Regards,
Mugunth

Thanks for the info.
SCIM does not work in windows OS ( I use GAIM both in windows and Linux ) .

It would be better if we can have an option to type tamil within Gaim
(with a plugin).

Open and popular

A CORRESPONDENT

An open-source suite of Tamil applications for the Windows
operating system is the first of its kind for the platform.

PANACEA DREAMWEAVERS, a Chennai-based software company, has
released an open source suite of Tamil applications and tools
into the public domain. It includes an accounting package,
two dictionaries, a management software for self-help groups
(SHGs), a simple text editor and a feature-rich word
processor, and about 250 free fonts. Most of the products
ship with the source code.

It is claimed that this is the first such initiative by a
company or organisation in the area of public domain Tamil
software. A similar effort was sponsored by the Central
Government, in which a collection of tools was acquired from
private players and released for public consumption in a
compact-disk form by Minister for Communications Dayanidhi
Maran. However, none of the software included in the package
was in open source format.

Besides, the company claims that its efforts are a first in
the Microsoft Windows-based Tamil computing environment. Most
open-source Tamil applications are developed for the Linux
operating system.

Open-source software is software whose source code is made
available to the public, enabling anyone to copy, modify or
redistribute the source code without paying royalties or
fees. Open source is associated with collaborative
development, wherein developers who have access to the
product's code correct any problems or deficiencies in it or
add additional features, thereby helping the software to
evolve. Many such applications are backed by a large number
of developers from all over the world and have evolved into
robust systems.

Some well-known examples of open-source initiatives are the
Linux operating system, the Integrated Development
Environment Eclipse, the Apache web server and the Mozilla
suite, including the web browser Firefox, which recorded its
100 millionth download recently.

One of the most prominent advocates of free software is the
Free Software Movement started by Richard Stallman in 1983.
The movement is also active in India, but its adherents focus
all their energies on writing software for open-source
operating systems such as Linux and not for the commercial
Windows platform.

In the CD under review, the products are neatly divided into
sections: Panacea Apps (short for applications), Panacea
Desk, Panacea Valaiyodi, and Source.

Panacea Apps comprises Mugavari (Tamil-English address book),
Sangam Pro (SHG management package), Selvam (accounting
software), Valluvan (documentation software), and
Pulavan-Paalam (dictionaries).

The Panacea Desk folder comprises Pathippu-250 (collection of
250 fonts), R4U (English-Tamil word processor), Saarathy
(keyboard driver) and Tamil Olai (simple Tamil text editor).

The Source folder includes the source code of all the
products except R4U and Valaiyodi.

According to the company, Sangam Pro is meant for
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to assess and evaluate
the performance of SHGs. Some of the features are the ability
to enter and save details of loans, repayments, meeting
schedules, deposits and membership.

Selvam, the software for maintaining accounts in Tamil, is
aimed at small and medium enterprises and is also suited for
home users. R4U, a Tamil-English word processor, easily
creates Tamil and even multilingual documents. Users can
easily switch between English and Tamil typing.

The other products in the suite are also useful and easy to
navigate. The company's stated mission to develop the
Valaiyodi browser into one that can translate English Web
pages into Tamil is something to look forward to.

Th applications have a few bugs, but they are minor and
should not stand in the way of encouraging such attempts. The
country sorely needs free software and open-source
initiatives for the Information Technology revolution to
reach most segments of society. And it is widely accepted
that the best way to go about achieving this is to write
software in the language of the people and make it available
free of cost.

Nevertheless, a few points need to be made. The collection of
fonts in TAB and TAM formats is no doubt excellent but run
the risk of obsolescence in a world that is quickly adopting
Unicode as the standard for recognising non-English textual
characters.

In text processing, Unicode takes the role of providing a
unique a number for each character. In other words, Unicode
represents a character in an abstract way, and leaves the
visual rendering (size, shape, font or style) to other
software, such as a Web browser or a word processor.

Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP make extensive use of Unicode as
an internal representation of text, while Unix-like operating
systems such as Linux, BSD and Mac OS X have adopted it as
the basis of representation of multilingual text.

Secondly, the dictionaries - both of which are
well-structured and simple to use - need to be updated. The
Tamil language has kept pace with the modern world and a
dictionary with contemporary words and phrases and their
usage will be most handy.

It is hoped that the budding entrepreneurs behind the venture
will do what is needed, for the collective good of the Tamil
computing world. Panacea Dreamweavers, which is hardly a year
old, is the brainchild of a group of entrepreneurs whose goal
is to develop solutions for the Tamil language computing
space, according to the founders. Their corporate philosophy
is that Tamil language software must not place any financial
compulsions on the end-user.

The software developer community in India and abroad would do
well to emulate this endeavour and come out with more such
products so that the divide between the digital haves and
have-nots is bridged.

Is it freely distributable? What license? We respect
software freedom/copyright. If it should not be
distributed freely, refrain from posting such e-mails.

I'd definitely recommend "Programming from the Ground
Up" for assembly programming for beginners, released
under GFDL:

Dear Friends,

I want to learn about writing my own program which is to be bootstrapped
by a boot loader like GRUB (like memtest+). Further more I want to know
any one has come across good book on writing such program
(e.g:memtest+). I want to do simple application which runs in its own
without any operating system. I think good books on "writing an
operating system" will also help me on this.

Any suggestion? Note: The purpose of this is to merely learn low level
programming with assembly and C.

This question is dependant on hardware/architecture.

I really wouldn't want to test hardware code on an
expensive laptop. Its recommended to get an old PII or
PIII for a testbed environment to test your code.

Do you wish to release it as free/open source
software? If yes, you can register your project to any
of the following sites at:

 http://sf.net
 http://savannah.gnu.org
 http://sarovar.org

You can use command-line "cvs":

Message-ID: <20060130145606.92116.qmail@web8609.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hi 

I want some online material to learn OS
implementations in Linux.
I have read OS by Silberschatz, but it was not
enough.Also i would like some one to give solution the
following problem,

A machine has 64 KB of virtual memory and 1 KB of
physical memory. This machine uses a set-associative
page table with a page size of 64 bytes and 4 sets.
The low order bits of the virtual page number are used
to decide the set in which a virtual page is placed.
The page replacement algorithm in each set is
round-robin: on the first page fault, the first page
in the set is replaced. On the second page fault, the
second page in the set is replaced and so on. The
contents of the page table are given in increasing
order of physical page number below, where the virtual
page number is in hex: 0xf8, 0x27c, 0x3b0, 0x2d4,
0x129, 0x2ed, 0x361, 0xc5, 0x5a, 0x25e, 0x212, 0x1b6,
0x28b, 0xcf, 0x3c3, 0x1a7. A program issues the
following virtual addresses in hex: 0xa71c, 0x16a0,
0x4a5c, 0x488c, 0xd844, 0x8bec, 0xdf24, 0x84a8. What
are the final contents of the Page Table?

This question appeared in code4bill contest.

Its only for OS concepts. "Chapter 20: The Linux
system" only gives you an overview. 

I'd definitely recommend "Understanding the Linux
Kernel".

Are you sure this is just 'spam'?  I think this is a worm. I've gotten
several such mails from 'known  folks' already. I don't see any 'news'
on Google/Yahoo! about such a worm though.

What I think is, when we register for it, it asks us whether to import
contacts from gmail or yahoo or msn mail address book. Probably the
ppl who tried it had given their id and passwd, and that website had
sent this mail to all those in their address book. Its 100% the fault
of the person who gave their id and passwd for it to send invite to
the ppl in address book, in that case.

Set the session to default, and in your .bashrc (or equivalent in your
shell), set WINDOWMANAGER=whatever-you-like (in your case, startkde).

Dear Karuppusamy,

Before enterning into the stuff you need to know more about the internal
workings of our computer systems starting from POST to Paging. There are
lots of online commentaries are available in the net which best
describes 
the internal workings of the kernel. 

For (e.g)

http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/Linux-i386-Boot-Code-HOWTO/

I first suggest you to study the manuals (especially Part 1 & Part2)
available in the intel site to know more about the architecture and
working
Principles of intel based systems.

If you want to start off with the boot loader you can use my code
available in the following site and it was written fully in assembly.

http://chennai.sancharnet.in/vasisg/boot.zip

Also refer to the following web site where you can explore the code of
mini OS.

http://www.menuetos.net/ 

Please let me know if you need further information.

the trouble is that, we still need to manually look at the spam and figure
out if the spammer needs to be removed from the list, because it is not
perfect. secondly, spamassassin will not be good at finding out the spamming
which we are trying to combat - i.e. spamming by an individual to one small
list using a perfectly legal website as some sort of a "mail client". it is
better at detecting spam ads and arbitrary dos program attachments kind of
spam. we can teach it though (spamassassin supports learning) - and i think
we may not be that sure that spamassassin has learned enough, before we can
entrust it with something drastic like automated removal of subscribers. so,
as of now, manual blocking seems to be the only resort. further, imo, this
is not that huge a group, and the spam not that frequent, to warrant this
step.

it moves on...

we already have spamassassin;  we also have source ip (dns) based
filtering in place. as of now, these are unlikely to stop 'get your free

Message-ID: <72a9b0620601310741t34067a66g8cce14f8f182ca43@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

    I was writing a code in kernel space to send an arp reply, upon
receiving a request which is not intended to me (I want to "fake :-) "
 the requester). I came across a function arp_send in
src/linux-2.4.18-14/net/ipv4/arp.c which I felt very straight forward
for my requirement.
I wanted to know whether this function is available on all versions of
linux? Is it really intended to this kind of faking. Whether I will
get faked, if I try this on different versions?

Regards

they give you a single port ethernet router; for me they gave DLink
ADSL single port router, free!!! NO RENTAL too;
try talking softly expressing a little concern with linux and airtel;
even if they charge normal rental, the router can be "appropriately

I would set eth0 to promiscuous mode so it will
capture all packets, and then write a simple
application code using libpcap, libnet libraries. You
will need to be root to run your application.

You have to keep re-compiling it and testing it. If
your target system is on a different system and you
can boot via NFS, its an idea environment for
development.

If you are compiling and testing on the same machine
(host and target), then its time consuming. You are
better off in doing it in user-space.

Should be. It implements the ARP protocol (RFC 826).

Start Konqueror, open "fonts:///". 

Open Nautilus and move to the directory where the TTF
fonts are present. 

You can now drag and drop the TTF fonts from Nautilus
to Konqueror?

I would be very happy if someone could help me out in getting the resources
for Tamil.

Start Konqueror, open "fonts:///". 

Open Nautilus and move to the directory where the TTF
fonts are present. 

You can now drag and drop the TTF fonts from Nautilus
to Konqueror?

hi all,
  In one of our remote box, I need to let a sudo user to change the IP address, mask, gateway.
   
  I tried giving access to the following commands: (i) netconfig (ii) /etc/rc.d/init.d/network stop, start, restart
   
  But when the sudo user is trying to change the ip address and restart the netconfig she is getting the following error mesg,
   
  Shutting down interface eth0: Users cannot control this device.
  [FAILED]
  Shutting down interface eth1: Users cannot control this device.
  [FAILED]
  Shutting down loopback interface: Users cannot control this device.
  [FAILED]
  Disabling IPv4 packet forwarding: error: permission denied on key 'net.ipv4.ip_forward'
  [FAILED]
  rm: cannot remove `/var/lock/subsys/network': Permission denied
  Setting network parameters: [ OK ]
  Bringing up loopback interface: Users cannot control this device.

  Bringing up interface eth0: Users cannot control this device.
  [FAILED]
  Bringing up interface eth1: Users cannot control this device.
  [FAILED]
  touch: creating `/var/lock/subsys/network': Permission denied
   
  To what other commands should I give access for this user to enable her to change the IP address and restart the network? 
   
  Please advice. Thank you.

  User root may run the following commands on this host:
    (ALL) ALL

  I checked the same command sudo -l -u <user> in my other local boxes also where I have permitted some user to start and stop httpd and which is working fine. Even there the same output is displayed.
