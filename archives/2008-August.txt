One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

updatedb -- Update the locate DateBase

Summary :

locate command is doing the quick search by using the database
created by this updatedb command. Normally this command is run
by cron at some periodic interval to keep the DB upto date.

Example:

# updatedb -u -- Create DB starting at / (root).

# updatedb -U /home -- Create DB starting at /home

# updatedb -f vfat -- Don't update VFAT file system

# updatedb -e /proc,/tmp -- Don't update /proc and /tmp dirs

# updatedb -v -- Display all files indexed when creating DB

Read: man updatedb

/** there is nothing to discuss - no IAS officer is ever given more than 3
years in a post. And it will be very difficult for the new guy to undo
everything that has been done. Look at it positively, Umashankar now has a
whole new department to linuxify **/

The new guy cannot do much..  but, there are always vulture waiting for the
turn..  there is scope, that proprietary softwares can just get the required
approval from this new guy, and then set their own motion..

Generally in highly techincal areas, the IAS officer can be extended till
the current scheme has been completed..  I typically see a invisible hand in
his transfer..

Possible scenarios..  the new ELCOT Laptop, will now be bundled with Windows
Vista, instead of SUSE..  the further Computerisation may use windows
products..  in the long run either co-operating with existing open source
applications deployed, or slowly replacing them, citing upgradation
problems..

It all depends on the new MD..

Message-ID: <c9ea6e770808010028m35a3b967p92e18cd9ca9460f6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Hope, everyone remember my earlier mail on possible implementation of open
source software for regular day to day use in colleges.

As a follow up, i have prepared a team of 4 final year students in mahendra
engg colelge, mallasamudram, tcode, and they have sourced a separate machine
and installed wiki, blogs and forums in that machine.

The principal seems to be encouraging these students..

I used the following setup..

1. WAMP server
2. Mediawiki
3. Wordpress
4. phpBB

I had a mobile conference with them, guiding them clearing their doubts..
Although, the above softwares are very simple, they had lot of obstacles,
and now, they seem to be confident of installing and deploying the
applications..

There was question of how to sustain these applications in future.. we have
proposed to build a team comprising of students from 2nd year, in training
on Open source web development, so that the skill set could continue in
future..

Next step:
--------------
To install a mail server (available in ubuntu server edition) and use an
open source mail client, preferrably Thunderbird, at each of the officials
systems.  Initially, it would be configured in principal's system, all HOD's
and staffs.

Later, a web based mail client can be setup so that each student would be
given a mail id, which they can access over the browser...

Request:
------------
I do not have experience in setting up a mail server.  So, can any one who
has experience in this, pls let me know, so that i could contact in case of
any help.

Also, any inputs or suggestions regarding this are welcome..

Regards,
Senthil Raja

In all likelihood, as a module which is loaded at runtime by Apache
(mod_php) (depending on what your server runs). One can also call PHP
in a fashion similar to CGI, but that is less preferred due to various
reasons, one of them being the necessity to fork/exec. There is also
FastCGI, but you can read about these things, I don't know too much to
explain...

HTH.

Please view this diagram with the firefox browser. ;)

Or better still view it with a mail client. Otherwise it will be 
broken mishmash of ASCII characters.

Coming to the point, the Apache web server communicates with active
content in the CGI either using a module or it may even be built in.

Apache protects the static content from getting trampled by dynamic
content(dangerous) using its own separation and security mechanisms.

Now you can create a universe with a CGI programs. ;)

Which is to say it is really very powerful. You can implement a search
engine (Obviously google also has to do it this way, no other choice),
or you could do various server side processing like accessing a
database, processing a user supplied form and so on.

The CGI interface gives you the choice to implement the server side
processing either using perl or PHP or shell script or even C.

You can even implement an IPC mechanism like UNIX domain sockets or even
network sockets between CGI backend and the CGI script (see above).

are you sure about this? I thought that perl, python etc use cgi  
whereas mod_perl, mod_python and php do not.

Then?

I dunno. Perhaps there is some terminology confusion.

I am sure perl CGI uses the same concept that I mentioned above and it
uses mod_perl.

I dunno about mod_python and php.

The idea is that the Apache server serves HTTP requests after active
processing by a combination of backends.

I dunno about php. But in python and perl there are two ways of doing  
a website:

1. Use standard python and perl with the CGI module - put your  
scripts in cgi-bin and apache invokes the python/perl interpreter to  
run the scripts - slow.

2. Use mod_perl/mod_python which is embedded in apache as a module.  
Put your scripts anywhere and apache runs them as a part of apache -  
fast. No CGI here.

Okay now you make yourself clear.

This difference is not important.

What matters is the overall architecture which is both same.

My diagram holds good in both cases.

Yes.. its indeed true..  Not even a bit of enthusiasm..

I just tried explaining to my two cousin sisters, all working as lecturers..
All of no use :(

Open source needs strategic mindset..  women generally lack that strategic
sense..  this is my humble opinion..

Dear Raja Ji,

Kenneth Ji has already written about top posting, so I would get directly to the point you are trying to raise here. I would beg to differ on your opinion, we cannot associate open source with anything peculiar or particular like 'strategic mindset'. Its a way of life...the choices some of us have made..And I strongly oppose generalizing on basis of gender or 'whatever'. It's just that its a male dominated society where in we believe that we are superior, which is quite quite incorrect. There are many woman active in FOSS domain, for your kind information recently GNOME Foundation appointed their first Executive Director, and you must be surprised to learn that she is a woman -- and her name is Stormy Peters -- you can read her interview also at 

:http://www.efytimes.com/efytimes/27615/news.htm

I remember once the famous science fiction writer A C Clarke was asked did he believe in God he said: "I don't know if *she* exist!" 

May be the god is a girl...
;-)

Swapnil

To speed it up, you can use fastcgi or speedycgi for this.  The fastcgi
process manages many running instances of your perl/php/python interpreters
and communicates with apache through a socket.  No more slow downs.

There are subtle but important differences in running your interpreter inside
apache's address space when loaded as a module, and running as a
separate process through CGI/fastcgi:

First issue is thready safety.  If your interpreter is not thread safe, and
mod_php for one is not, then apache itself can't run in threaded mode.
Both apache and your interpreter need to agree on how they handle
threads.

Second, if you are virtual hosting, you will want to isolate code from the
various webs that you are hosting on a single apache instance.  You
can run each web in its own CGI/fastcgi process with complete isolation
from other webs.  Achieving isolation through the mod_* approach is
possible, but prone to exploits.  Nearly all hosting providers I've used run
cgi/fastcgi and not mod_*.

Third, using the fastcgi approach, apache and fastcgi don't need to run
on the same physical machine.  Fastcgi can run on separate machines
optimized for generating the dynamic content while apache servers can
be on hardware tuned for content delivery/serving.  Fastcgi offers greater
flexibility when you need to scale up.

Bleh[1]: Please do not top post and please chop off old signatures when 
you are quoting past mails.

Bleh[2]: Open source needs open minds and whoever has it will be 
successful. There are lots of successful women in FOSS world, especially 
in area which need creative, patient minds. As far as I am exposed to 
Ubuntu project, there are lots of women participating in higher levels 
of managing the project. I also know few womens who are more like brand 
names in Usability and HCI area, especially in KDE circles. We also have 
women from India contributing to the Linux kernel project itself. We 
have lots of Indian women involved in Localization projects. Just 
because you didn't know any of them till now, please stop from making 
such statements. Open Source do not consider only writing code as 
contribution, and we have a hell lot of non-code-writing women 
contributions.

May be the problem was with the "lecturing" part, which is common with 
all kids. You have to show them how interesting the contributing to FOSS 
can get and how they can make a mark without getting into writing code. 
If you try to teach PHP and MYSQL everytime and to every kid out there, 
that might not be interesting enough for them.

Just my 2 paisas :)

Debian Women is one of stand out example.

Apart from that, I feel that girls normally prefer not being at the
computer. However I feel that girls are equally good at grasping stuff. I
was teaching the basics of bash to my classmates. The girls were actually
able to write more working code than boys. It might just be that the
grasping levels were not the same. But still... Girls _can_ do it.

I remember reading in Kenneth Rosen's book "De Morgan advised Lady Ada
Lovelace not to do too much of math since it could affect her child bearing
capabilities"... Lady Ada went on to become the first computer programmer.

Also recently, some lady got the turing award. I dont remember her name. In
IRC however, there are very few girls proving only 1 point, their virtual
selves are less chatty :P

I am not talking of male superiority..  i am of the opinion that no one can

Regarding women's participation in FOSS, i am not generalising any thing..
i just expressed the underlying reason, that i had opined..

There is no second thought women should be encouraged to participate..

Btw, i am a fan of "Alolita Sharma" who writes regularly at LFY..  we can
see her blog at http://opensourcebuzz.blogspot.com/

However, the fact that there is only negligible women members participating
in the discussion here, cannot be overlooked..

Man,

Women lack strategic mindset? ;)

Did you know that even the best of Gods/men have to learn strategy from
women?

Do you know that Chankya's efforts at capturing the kingdom kept on
failing until a woman feeding roti to her child joked and a spy carried
this information to Chanakya who then figured out the folly and won?

Whether or not that helps in open source is an altogether different
matter.

And my opinion on this topic ain't worth a penny either. ;)

Example:

$ ping localhost -- Resolve the IP for localhost and Ping it.

$ ping 127.0.0.1 -- Ping for IP 127.0.0.1

$ ping -a host -- Bell after every successful ping.

$ ping -b 192.168.1.255 -- Ping the broadcast IP.

$ ping -c 6 host -- Stop after sending 6 ECHO_REQUEST packets.

# ping -f host -- Flood ping. Packets will generated with Zero inter 
                  packet time.

$ ping -i 5 host -- Wait 5 seconds between sending each packet.

$ ping -q host -- Quiet Mode. Only shows initial and end summary.

$ ping -R host -- Record and print the route used by the packets.

$ ping -s 100 host -- Sent 100 bytes ICMP packet. Default 56 Bytes.

$ ping -w 5 host -- Ping for 5 Sec and Exit.

This is something to do with your Motherboard. You might find this
option in the BIOS, while booting. Usually you can get in there by
pressing 'DEL' or 'F2' just after powering on.

BIOS doesn't have option for USB. It only has Floppy/internal HDD/DVD.
Is usb option available with latest MBoard? I am using intel845GV.
Is there any second option like "Boot using one OS then execute some script to boot the OS, installed on external HDD"?

Most modern motherboards have the option of booting from local hard 
disk, CD/DVDROM, Floppy, network, USB.  My two year old Intel mobo has 
all these options.  How old is your motherboard?  See if Intel has a 
BIOS update for the same.

Message-ID: <20080804104953.GA3753@gayatri.gayatri-hitech.com>

Hi luggies,

Can you please help out my friend who sent me this query?

Thanks.

-Girish

--------------------------------------------------------------
For remote control of PCs, we do the following :
Run VNC server on Remote end PC
Run VnCViewer on Engineer PC
Using the IP number of the Remote End and the password of Remote VNC
server,
we connect to remote end.

This is a tedious process. Maintenance of Password at remote end, Open
Port
of VNC server at remote end, etc. are big issues.

There is a different approach called "Reverse VNC". Here, the client
runs in
a "listen mode" and the remote server "reverse connects" to the client.
Since the connection is made by the remote server, the password of the
server is not required by the client. Further, the IP of the client
(engineer) alone is required for the Remote End. Thus it is the best for
remote control (7000 PCs across India)

If I use both server and client from Tight VNC, reverse vnc works fine.
Same
case with Ultra VNC.

There is a "stripped down" version of UltraVNC called Ultra VNC Single
Click. This is meant only for reverse connection. It is not a
full-fledged
server. Size-wise it is small, and very safe. It kiils the process
itself
after the use

1. If I use this "UltraVNC SC", as server, and the client as Ultra VNC
client, things work.

2. However, if I use "ultraVNC SC" as server and TightVNC as client,
negotiation of  "codec" is not successful...

I can live with  (1), but my Anti Spyware shouts if I use UltraVNC
client....It does not shout if I use (2)

Question : What is the default "codec" used by UltraVNC? Is there a
"common"
codec for UltraVNC and TightVNC ?

This seems to be the most interesting to me. I am one of the victim of
paying Windows tax for my Dell laptop. Those stupids didn't give me a CD,
instead they loaded the OS in a separate partition in my hard disk. Since I
had a valid licensed version of windows, I was in a mood not to through it
away (because once i format my system, it is gone forever) and try out
Linux. Now I see an option here to test Linux on my external hard disk that
I bought last week.

if you just want to try out, there is an easier option available - try one of 
the 'live' versions; you can boot off the live cd or dvd and see how things 
work. of course, not everything will be available, but it should be enough to 
give you a taste and try out.

Is it going off the topic? Can we take this off list if it does?

Message-ID: <loom.20080804T123046-790@post.gmane.org>

Dear Friends,

    There are many automated tools for testing web front end.   
One such is 'Selenium Remote Controller'  which can be used for 
testing web front end. 

How it works :
    -> There should be a selenium server running ( built in java )
    Selenium API's can be used to communicated with the selenium server 
through selenium client.
    -> We should write the client script to communicate with the selenium 
server. This client can be written in Perl/PHP/java/C/Ruby/ and may 
be many more. Selenium provides client drivers(wrappers) for the 
above languages.

How to do :
    -> download 'Selenium RC controller' which will contain the server 
files and client drivers.
    -> execute ' java -jar selenium-server.jar'.  (ensure that java is 
installed and PATH variable set appropriately )
    -> The above command will start the selenium server.  This will 
act as a proxy server in the configurable port '4444' .
    -> Change the proxy settings of your browser to 'localhost' with 
port '4444'.
    -> Then execute your client script.

Selenium IDE:
    Instead of going through the selenium server and client scripts, 
there is another simple method which can be used to do testing.  
'Selenium IDE' is a firefox add-on which can be downloaded as a firefox 
extension. 

After installing the IDE, Open the page that you want to test.
Open Tools->Selenium IDE. 
Then do whatever work that you wanted to do in the web page.
After completing all the works, click 'stop recording' button in the Selenium 
IDE.

We can either save that test case and edit/execute it whenever required.
Selenium IDE also gives provision to get the source code for that testing 
in the desired language ( Perl/PHP/Java/Ruby/..)
We can take that source code, find the commands that we want and write a more
sophisticated client script for testing.
This will be very useful for us to easily selenium client scripts
Reference : http://selenium-rc.openqa.org/tutorial.html

Hope someone finds it useful

Thanks,
Jyothi

I also had this same problem, mine is HP. But HP have one application in
Vista to save that separate partition in DVDs. I backed up that recovery
partition into two DVDs. This is the first thing I did after I bought my
laptop.

Now I dumped Vista and Installed Ubuntu. Its going nice. But there is
another way to try Linux without disturbing your Internal Hard Disk.

In Browsing Centers, I use my pendrive to boot 'puppylinux'. These are
the steps I follow,

1. Connect pendrive with system.
2. Reboot,
3. Press 'DEL' or F2 or whatever key to go to bios.
4. Search for an option called 'Boot Priority'.
5. There I'll see my Pendrive Name('JetFlash')
6. Change Pendrive priority higher than the Internal Hard Disk.
7. Save and Exit BIOS.

Thats all Puppy will start to boot(Before that we need to install
'puppylinux' into our pendrive. Its so simple in puppy).

I don't know much about the bootloader used in External Hard Disks.
Puppylinux uses 'syslinux' to boot from pendrive.

Mohan R.

I would advice you to dump Windows and do a fresh Linux install.

If you are not ready to do that, you can resize the partitions in
Vista without any data loss using its disk management.  Create a new
partition and install Linux on it.

Has anyone resized Vista partition with the NTFS resizing utils that 
come with Fedora 9 and other distros?

From what I have observed on a friend's laptop, the Vista disk manager 
will allow shrinkage upto 50% or thereabouts of the disk space.  This 
is a lot of disk space waste if you are keeping Vista for occassional 
use.

I resized Vista Partition with Gparted. After Partition we need boot
Vista to recorrect its partition sizes.

Dear All,

I posted this a while ago, I am facing a strange problem for the last 15 days. I can not browse the Internet though Linux, where as it works well if I do it through the 'now' discarded Windows XP. The problem is sometime Linux does connect me to the Internet. At the same time I can use Pidgin etc and other Bittorent clients to download distros, but cant browse the Internet.. Another amazing thing is, while I cannt open any other site, Microsoft.com opens in a second...so what could be the issue?

My hardware is OK as it could connect to the net through Windows, My distro is OK as it does connect to net some times (don't forget seamless connectivity to chat and torrents). Also I have tried other distros, apart from my primary Ubuntu --- Fedora, OpenSUSE, Mandriva and many more...

I have spoken to Sify guys also but they are not able to give any solution, what should I do? This is very critical...? I dont want to use Windows for a second...and alas...I have to use Windows to send this email....please help...

Swapnil

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

nameif -- NAME network InterFaces based on MAC addresses.

Summary :

nameif is used to rename the network interfaces based on MAC
addresses. It is useful, when you have more then one network 
interfaces/cards & you want to specify the name (eth0, .. ) 
for each interfaces. 

Example:

# nameif -- Read the config info from /etc/mactab file.

# nameif -s -- Same as above. But error messages goto the syslog.

# nameif eth0 00:0D:87:77:74:5C -- Name the card with specified MAC 
                                   as eth0 and error goto syslog.

Note: 

1. Nameif should be run before the interface is up.
   Otherwise it will fail.
2. Format of the /etc/mactab file:-
   # Comments
   eth0 00:0D:87:77:74:5B
   eth1 00:0D:87:78:7D:6B

Read: man nameif

I have installed Kubuntu on a external USB harddisk and the installation procedure is almost same as installing it on any internal IDE / SATA disk. (Recommended 7.10 / 8.04; Kubuntu preferably ;)) 

a. Boot from K/Ubuntu LIVE CD with the USB disk connected to the computer. 

b. Start the installation procedure; Select Manual Partitioning, and choose to partition your USB hard disk with a partitioning scheme suitable to your needs. (For an ideal scheme see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DiskSpace)

c. Make sure, you are partitioning the USB hard disk (ideally, would be sdb) while performing a manual partitioning. 

d. Advanced upto the last step, where you can confirm all the installation parameters. Before you hit the 'next'/ 'finish' button, click on "Advanced Options"

e. In that you'll see (hd0), within a textbox, which specifies the installation disk of GRUB. Note, your first hard disk (internal IDE / SATA) is hd0, and therefore, change the entry to 'hd1' in that textbox and click OK. If you forget this, you'll end up having the USB disk connected to the computer, whenever you want to boot. 

I assume, you'll try this out. 

Not surprisingly, when you try to boot off this disk, the OS doesn't boot. You need to make a small change in the file

/boot/grub/menu.lst 

on the line of root (hd1,x) to (hd0,x). 

Why? I have noticed, when you are trying to boot from the USB disk, it happens to be the "first" hard disk (hd0). 

I would also request you to read: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
(Method 1) at-least once, carefully, before you begin installation. 

If you have laptop pre-installed with Windows Vista / XP, and have purchased an external USB disk, such a setup might be ideal for you to use both OSes (if required; or just Kubuntu). 

However, I'm not really sure, if the USB hard disk is capable to bear the same wear and tear the internal hard disk does.

Can you ping to google.com or any other website that you are unable to
browse?
Does it resolve the IP address of google.com?

something like this?...
[muneer@localhost ~]$ping www.google.com

Are you sure, your torrent does not suck a lot of bandwidth ? Try
stopping all other network activity and try browsing. If it still does
not work publish ping results of google.com and microsoft.com

Yes.

The first day can be spent for this.

Two from Ubuntu Tamil Team can be there. Installation, setting up media
support, playing VCD, connecting to internet, basic package management,
enabling Tamil Support, Introduction to Office tools, Internet Utilities and
most common expectations from a common user were covered and well documented
[1] during the introductory classes conducted at NRCFOSS [2].

The Classes can be taken in Tamil as it was previously. Participants can be
introduced to networking the next day. This can be setting up a LAN, LTSP
etc., I can prepare the document again in Tamil for the same in the time
that remain between.

Ubuntu Tamil Team can also assure post-event mailing list[1] support for the
participants which can also be ILUGC in Tamil/ English.

please put your ideas on the wiki page:

http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/OotyHardwareWorkshop

also please remember that we also need to train in an RPM based  
distro as the majority of installations are redhat/fedora, and that  
although Ooty is in Tamilnadu, the majority of the population is non- 
tamil, so they will be able to understand tamil, but may not be able  
to read and write.

No, I have cleared the cache, even on the freshly installed OS, Microsoft site opened in a second, while others did not. I have checked the ports and everything visible at my end - I mean firewall, DNS, browser settings.

I have tried that also, even if I am not using anything else it just wont connect, Also Sify doesn't allow pining to other websites....

What I want to ask is, is it possible that at Sify end, when it detects Linux it somehow blocks the port which teh browser uses? Coz right now its working fine, but I know in 10-15 minutes once again I will be under the no Internet cloud...

Swapnil




Dear All,

I posted this a while ago, I am facing a strange problem for the last 15 days. I can not browse the Internet though Linux, where as it works well if I do it through the 'now' discarded Windows XP. The problem is sometime Linux does connect me to the Internet. At the same time I can use Pidgin etc and other Bittorent clients to download distros, but cant browse the Internet.. Another amazing thing is, while I cannt open any other site, Microsoft.com opens in a second...so what could be the issue?

My hardware is OK as it could connect to the net through Windows, My distro is OK as it does connect to net some times (don't forget seamless connectivity to chat and torrents). Also I have tried other distros, apart from my primary Ubuntu --- Fedora, OpenSUSE, Mandriva and many more...

I have spoken to Sify guys also but they are not able to give any solution, what should I do? This is very critical...? I dont want to use Windows for a second...and alas...I have to use Windows to send this email....please help...

Swapnil

You can check this by telnetting to google.com

try this:

[muneerc@tlocalhost ~]$ telnet google.com 80
Trying 72.14.207.99...
Connected to google.com (72.14.207.99).
Escape character is '^]'.


Once this prompt is available, issue the HTTP command "GET /" and press
enter. You will get the following output

GET /
<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv="content-type"
content="text/html;charset=utf-8">
<TITLE>302 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H1>302 Moved</H1>
The document has moved
<A HREF="http://www.google.co.in/">here</A>.
</BODY></HTML>
Connection closed by foreign host.

Not sure whether your sify blocks telnet also. Just give a try when you are
isolated from internet. If it works, then it is surely a browser problem.

Hi,
  I want one clarification w.r.t PPPOE on connecting to the internet.  Quiet
often I am unable to use the internet.  When I gone through the logs, I
found that the modem got disconnected and get connected after some time.   I
informed them that there was the problem in the Service Provider side ( as
from the log report ).   But they are telling that the line is proper.  Is
there any way to prove them that there is a problem in their side only, or
its the problem with the ppd/OS.   Please help me out.

  System runs on Ubuntu  and firefox 3 Beta.

Have you tried this when you are not able to browse? If this is successful
when you are blacked out from internet, then your service provider is not
blocking your http and most probably your browser is at fault (because you
are able to access port 80 from a different application). If your telnet on
port 80 is also blocked, then there is some problem with your modem or
service provider. In my opinion, service provider will never block any
traffic simply because the OS is Linux, so the second possibility is very
rare.(I am assuming that "ping www.google.com" is successful when you are
blacked out)

Hi Muneer,

When I try to ping Google, this is what I get:

root@ubuntu:~# ping google.com
PING google.com (64.233.167.99) 56(84) bytes of data.

Pininging Microsoft

--- microsoft.com ping statistics ---
17 packets transmitted, 0 received, +4 errors, 100% packet loss, time 16235ms

Another strange thing is when I am blacked out: 
1. I cannot browse the Internet whereas when I put Microsoft.com, it opens flawlessly. It cannot open any other site.
2. Even Synaptic can download things at good speed.
3. However, Synaptic cannot index repositories when I am in 'no net cloud' However it can 'download and install software.
4. If I use any other Internet application, it works well.
5. Sites it opens is Microsoft.com, winap.com, download.com, cnet.com etc but not other like google, yahoo, ubuntu and many more...

This all is making it complicated. If there is something wrong with browser, why does it open sites at sometimes but not at other times...?

Hi,

You must have heard on the Ubuntu Global Bug Jam by now. If not read
it here NOW -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GlobalBugJam
It would be great if a few of the interested folks in Chennai can get
together at some place with Internet connectivity and start squashing
bugs jointly. Anybody game? If so please reply to this thread. We will
get a venue (if you have a proposal/agree to host for the same, most
welcome). Its not necessary that we end up being there all the three
days, we can fix a convenient time and get together.

In fact we have our LUG meet too this week IIRC. May be after the LUG
meet we can head to some place and start squashing bugs. If nothing
works out, I have wireless at my place and a big covered terrace where
I can host a few people with Coffee and biscuuuts ;).

Also there is a quick intro session tomorrow at #ubuntu-bugs @
irc.freenode.net from 2130 hrs IST for general questions about the
Global Bug Jam. Be there!!!

Lets squash bugs

Is your modem is an usb modem? Which version of Ubuntu you are using?

Check with pidgin or any application other than firefox. There is one
bug in Ubuntu 8.04, firefox will show "working offline" even you are
connected with internet
(https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/191889).

Did you check with 'ping www.google.co.in'?

Thanks,

Dear all,

I am in need of ubuntu CD package. I dont need DVD since my desktop computer
is with CD Drive only. Kindly lend me the same so that I will collect in the
ILUGC meeting that is supposed to be held on 09/08/2008.

Another Kind Request :

I have a GPS receiver from Garmin with USB interface. I bring the same along
with a laptop pre-loaded with Ubuntu and SUSE linux enterprise desktop.
Kindly help me in uploading the GPS data as GPX file (ofcourse from the GPS
receiver to the laptop) in the ILUGC meet. The ubuntu partition is without
root user. I am unable to edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file and connect to
the repository. Kindly do the same.

I have absolutely no clue on this behavior :-(. It seems 124.7.230.97 is
doing some dirty firewall filtering. I dont understand why sify blocks
pinging websites. With this level of filtering, I suspect they have some
more unfair filtering there. Please check who is 124.7.130.97. If it is your
Modem IP address, then you can have a look at its fire wall table. If it is
ISP's IP, then you may have to pull their legs.

mtools - Utilities to access DOS disks in Unix

Summary :

Mtools is a public domain collection of tools to allow Unix systems to

DOS file system (Default floppy). Each program attempts to emulate the
MS-DOS equivalent command.

Example:

$ mdir -- List files from the floppy.

$ minfo -- Get DOS FS info.

$ mdu dir1 -- Space usage report of dir1.

$ mcopy myfile a: -- Copy DOS files to/from Linux.

$ mcd dir1 -- Change the current dir to a:/dir1.

$ mmove file1 file2 -- Move/Rename an DOS file/subdir.

$ mdel file -- Del a DOS file from floppy.

$ mdeltree dir -- Del a DOS dirtree from floppy.

$ mformat --  Create a DOS FS in a formatted floppy.

$ mlabel -- Make DOS volume label.

Note:
1) More tools are available in MTool Set.
2) Behavior of MTools will change depending upon the 
   configuration at /etc/mtools.conf.

Read: man mtools

install gpsbabel
find out which usb port is used for the garmin by doing:
tail -f /var/log/messages
and plugging in the garmin
then as root, do:
gpsbabel -D9 -t -i garmin -o gpx -f /dev/usbport -F outputfile.gpx

We need to assume the most common scenario (say, the C/ C++ Lab that already
exist will run on GNU/ Linux) that can be implemented and passed on to
students, as soon as they return back to their respective colleges.

not necessarily will all items be covered. depends on the speakers.  
if there are more items we can divide into two tracks. the idea is to  
give them a taste of a wide range of foss goodies so that they will  
be eager for more in-depth workshops in the future.

It is normal for PPPoE to get disconnected and reconnected.

Whether PPPOE Daemon in linux or pppoe connection ?

If pppoe connection, then whether it is not recommended to use PPPOE.
Shall we blame the Service Provider ?

Most devices (like the DLink 502T) also have an "always connected" 
option, from it's end it does not disconnect.  Of course, it has no 
control if the service provider drops the connection.

For ADSL either you have to use PPPoE or PPPoA. There is no other choice.
Usually the ISP's RAS equipment may goof up leading to this.

And how often PPPoE goes up and down depends on the ISP.

When I used to live in Mambalam it used to be really really rare but now
in Tambaram I see it more often.

But this is not something that you can control from your end.

Hope I have put things in proper perspective.

Your phone line could be made noise free. Other than that this problem
has nothing to do with software on your end. Usually that is.

I second ramdas..  Its too much information in two days..

Any way..  this is a best initiative in terms of FOSS, and i understand that
its a introduction seminar that would drive interests to the faculty for
further practical workshops..

However, what i feel was that, we need to change the methodology and
approach in delivering foss..  We can explain different scenarios, and then
explain how we can use FOSS technologies there..

Just my few cents...

For power, my network device is PoE capable and also has a 12V/1A DC in.  
There are no power outlets near the device.  Also, the ethernet switch 
does not have any PoE ports.

I am looking for an adapter, that sits in the wiring closet alongside 
the Ethernet switch, with input a) Jack for DC12V/1A in, b) RJ45 LAN in 
(from switch), and output A) RJ45 LAN out (ethernet+dc power).

If you have used or know of such a beast please share make/model.

I think its better to give a lecture on how to compile c/c++ and java
program in Linux, How to use software design tools like umbrello, how
to use software development tools like kdevelop, quanta plus,
bluefish, etc. Your talk may attract them if its more syllabus
oriented.

IMO,
Good idea indeed,Will it not be still good where  we teach open source
as open source which has no boundaries,fixing the lecturers to the
curriculum oriented syllabus where each lecturer may feel like landing
in a typical computer training center. I am not in offence with the
training industry here.

As a lecturer , one needs  to be well informed and par excel by
knowing the market trends than his/her student.Event like these help
the college people to interact with the  domain experts who address
the attendees, I feel these kind of interaction  will give fantastic
understanding about the subject for the lecturing world.
instead of fixing to college syllabus, if we have  open source
software lectures in the ilugc pattern sessions, it will have good
impact. I too agree that if we can give lecturers with advanced
concepts which may be related with their evolving syllabus will be
useful to them.

Thanks and regards

different people are interested in different things - this is just to  
show the wide range of things available. We did the same thing for  
Shivaji university in Kolhapur - and it worked well, after that many  
people have approached for in-depth workshops for particular  
subjects. We have already conducted a 6 day workshop on LAMP. Anyway  
you will be there, so we can see how it goes. It is also necessary to  
be flexible - once or twice we have changed the schedule when we saw  
the feedback from the audience.

=============================

whereis -- Locate the bin, src & man page for a file.

Summary :

'whereis' locates source/binary and manuals sections for specified

of standard Linux places, which is hard-coded in it.

Example:

$ whereis ls -- Display the bin, src(if avail) and man page locations.

$ whereis -b ls -- Show only bin file location.

$ whereis -m ls -- Show only man page location.

$ whereis -s ls -- Show only source file location.

$ whereis -u -M /usr/share/man/man1 -f route -- Find the bin file 
                location and search for man page in only man1 dir.

we want to re-orient the syllabus - that is the goal of NRC-FOSS, and  
the big stumbling block are the lecturers. Management want it,  
students want it, but lecturers are blocking it. So we are trying to  
get a few lecturers excited about foss - and very very few of these  
ever write code.

Recently [last week] we conducted a TTP in Anna University, Trichy. The same
thing happened here also. Very few only came out of all trichy surrounding
areas. In other words, I can say, the no of speakers were more compare with
participants.

I would like to share an participant's feedback with all of you. "In our
college we have an allowance scheme like if I will participate this type of
workshop, then our college will give 500/- for me. I came just for getting
my allowance".
How is it. But at the same time some others were really interested in FOSS
and Linux.

Its happening in all the TTP. The staff's only argument is, "why we want to
learn a topic from out of syllabus". Still FOSS is an elective paper. They
will not take it as seriously until it will be one of the main subject in
their curriculum. Otherwise FOSS will be just optional. So try  to make it
as a compulsory paper to the final year students.

Just a thought. Here is the difference between whereis, locate and which

whereis - can find any file, but looks only in standard locations.

locate - can find any file from any location, however there should be a
locatedb update run frequently to have accurate results.

which - can find executables which are in the path variable.

Sir,
     Old mother board BIOS will not support USB booting. In this case, one

floppy then start the OS avail;able in external drive.

    One more thing in external HHD is booting configuration compiled with

HHDs and CD Drives available in PC. If you try to boot other type of
machines it may fail. for example, Your machine has PATA HHDs, then your
pendrive device in the machine is 'sda' but in SATA HHD used PC it may vary.

     Puppy Linux have an universal installor, makes USB as super boot disk.
which is format your usb disk/drive as endless file format.MBR will not

?
In my college, its the reverse, the faculty is highly qualified to take up FOSS related subjects and management is also interested but it is the students who is not selecting the elective paper(democracy followed in choosing elective). I tried last year to?take this elective paper but the student community prefer data mining & datawarehouse. Reason not because of interest but because 1) Easy to clear? 2) Local author books aka guide books available 3) Notion that anything related to Linux is difficult.
?
In fact I corrected anna university FOSS elective paper. I found the syllabi good and the recommended textbook is also of good quality.
?
Need of the hour is not only awareness among faculties but with students also.

\--

There are reasons for this (and hopefully the discussion will not diverge):

1. They are not highly paid. So, they have no interest to come forward
to take initiative.

2. Intra-, Inter-departmental ego/politics.

3. Also the fact that when external folks like us take initiative and
come to teach the students, the faculty feel they are being
isolated/pushed to a corner, because:
- "interested students" directly learn from us, without a need for a faculty.
- they don't understand that there is no hierarchy in a FOSS work culture.

But, then they haven't take any initiative in the first place to
learn, and teach their students.

In spite of these, there are also exceptional faculty who dedicate
their work for the values of FOSS, and for the benefit of students.

Just my thoughts,

SK

in Kolhapur, 11 faculty came from outside for the 6 day workshop.  
Each one paid 800 rs, they were all senior faculty and all of them  
sat through *all* the sessions without break. There were also local  
faculty and students who also sat through the sessions. Level of  
interest was very high. This was because these 11 people had attended  
the two-day workshop and got interested from that. The 2 day workshop  
had been attended by about 50 faculty including these 11. Actually  
many more wanted to come for the workshop, but did not get leave from  
their colleges.

Whether FOSS is optional or compulsory, they will just teach it as a  
tool - like they teach windows stuff. What  we are trying to do is to  
get a few people to become passionate about FOSS, and they will  
inspire students - regardless of whether it is in the syllabus or  
not. So, if I get *three* faculty in this region, I am happy.

Target the students..  they cant ignore, as it enhances the career..

Two years before, i tried approaching the HOD of a college.. But, there was
not much response, as the information is not clearly conveyed.. (rather the
opportunity does not arise)..

Now, from the same college, i have formed a 4 member team.. who are very
much interested..  I took some efforts on my own initially to teach the
basic..  Now, they used to call me often for any help and i am relaxed..

And when we have a set of team listening us (whether its student or
lecturers), we can then direct them to the source of learning..

The underlying motto is "Give only when they seek.. " .. but for that, we
need to create the interest in them..

So, in the next conference, the students can also be invited along with the
faculties..

Regards,
Senthil

Sure. As I mentioned earlier, most of our core graphics and production
tracking and management applications and systems are developed
in-house.  At the same time, we use a lot of FOSS software and
libraries in our environment. For example, a lot of our software is
developed with open languages like C++, Perl and Python.  We leverage
software like MySQL, Asterisk, Nagios, Apache etc. in our systems and
customize them for our needs where necessary.

could you be more specific - do you use inkscape, gimp, blender,  
audacity? what do you use for video/sound editing? What are your  
feedbacks on these tools in the professional environment?

We are a visual effects company and do not typically handle sound editing.

Inkscape and Audacity - We don't use these tools in-house, so I'm not
in a position to comment on them. However I hear they're pretty good
tools.

Gimp - We have worked closely with Gimp. More specifically, we have
built several enhancements to the Gimp code such as the ability to
manipulate high resolution images, support for floating point pixel
values etc. These enhancements have been released to the community
under the name of 'CinePaint' (www.cinepaint.org)

Blender - We do not use blender in any of our productions right now.
However we do have several blender enthusiasts in the organization who
use it in their personal projects.

Thanks

Dear all,

On coming saturday can anybody explain me

1. How to make my folders secured; When I am not in my seat, others should
not try to copy
    my folders in their USB, CD etc. Even password security will do. How to
do it on SUSE
    Linux Enterprise Desktop 10.0

2. How to automount a usb ? If I insert my pendrive in my laptop, it does
not mount the same
    automatically. I need to mount by going to super user mode (in CLI). If
I insert another
    pendrive in another USB slot (while the first is already inserted in a
USB slot), the second
    mounts automatically while the first doesn't. I use SLED 10. I checked
/etc/fstab and
    edited the usb mount point to auto mount. Even after the adjustment the
same problem is
    there.

3. How to interface GPS receiver with ubuntu ?

I will bring my laptops. Please help

Thanks and regards,
A V Bharath Kumar,

Sure. We'd be happy to share our insights, on how we use FOSS in our
environment, with the community. In fact, we often give presentations
at our studio where we invite students from institutes and other
interested parties to come in and learn a little bit about us.

1. Which movie player are you using?
2. What movie format are you trying to play?
3. What is your system configuration, especially the graphic card?

In the meantime, install VLC player.

Please give answer to these questions. I have been using Ubuntu for quite a while and its something that gives me almost anything -- like a Kamdhenu....so don't worry, just let me know the specs :-)

Welcome to the linux - and especially to Ubuntu.

install all the codecs and needed players....

Can you please tell us about the video format that you are using and the
player you use.
Also, is this video present in your hard disk or is being read from a DVD/CD
player?

Highly unfortunate, which means you would have missed many interesting
clips/videos :) - probably you might find a solution after giving the
answers.

[1] What format of video?
[2] Which players?
[3] What codecs got installed?

Try running the player from command line with the file path as the 
argument, like 'totem /home/magesh/videos/thevideo.avi'
When you try to play a video file which need codecs, Ubuntu asks whether 
it can install codec if the corresponding format has one and if given 
yes for the installation, it installs the codec and plays the file. 
Sometimes it may need to close the player and open it again.

Again which file format and which player? Can you please try doing the 
above said "run command from terminal" procedure and show us whatever 
comes on the screen (Please paste the output from the terminal on to a 
pastebin like pastebin.com and give the link for the page to us)?

Mahesh,
1. Linux is basically to support Open and free Source formats as per GPL
2. Ubuntu's specialty is within its boundaries of Open and free source. But
it will supply restricted drivers for users with intimation of restriction.

 Normally Ubuntu supports ogg and FLAC file formats for Audio and Vedio.
Please post the file format you used and try to get required codecs

For Mr. Kenneth,
Sir,

I accept Mandriva is more flexible than Ubuntu but It is not an single
solution. It is one of the way.

I am sorry for this.

Padhu,
Ooty.

If you are trying to play VCDs, or Dat files, try installing Gxine...It will play all the .dat files.

I solely use Mplayer on Archlinux. But I think I have seen this problem in
Ubuntu before. The mplayer solution is doing mplayer -vo help .This will
list all video output drivers.. Try them all till one of them plays..

eg mplayer -vo xv
mplayer -vo X11 ..

When you get the one that works add the following line to your
.mplayer/config
vo="xv"
or vo="X11" etc.

Microsoft uses a third party service - Akamai to cache and mirror their

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

cdplay, cdp -- Program to Control & Play Audio CDs.

Summary:

cdplay is a text-mode program for controlling and playing audio CDs.  
cdp is same as cdplay. But it is an interactive program. It uses the
NUM keypad as a control panel to allow you to move track to track,
play, pause, stop, and resume playing of audio CDs.

Example:

$ cdp -- Start in interactive mode with text based user interface.

$ cdplay -- Start playing the Audio CD in the CD Drive.

$ cdplay play 6 -- Play the track number 6.

$ cdplay stop -- Stop it.

$ cdplay -l -- Slow start (Give some time for CD Drive to init).

$ cdplay table -- Show CD Contents.

Note: 
1) Most of the command line options are same for cdplay and cdp.
2) If the Audio-Out of the CD Drive is not connected to sound 
   card then, you have use the head-phone out of the CD Drive to 
   hear the music.

Read: man cdp / cdplay

A similar command is type. It is shell builtin. Very fast, searches in $PATH but only executables. e.g
 type ls

$ time which ls
alias ls='ls --color=tty'

As another poster has already pointed out, MS uses Akamai and netcraft is
reporting information from the Akamai servers.

Incidentally, MS IIS 6 and MS IIS 7 have no existing exploitable
vulnerabilities while Apache does.
http://secunia.com/product/1438/

One side fact about Akamai (especially since September 11th is drawing
near), the Akamai founder and CTO Danny Lewin (a MIT Alumni and an
accomplished geek with many technologies attributed directly to him) was
one of the people who died during the 911 attacks. It is claimed that he
was the first victim of the attack, though that is difficult to prove:

Secunia is hardly a reliable source. For one thing, they count on vendor 
accepting something as a vulnerability before listing it. That makes it 
easier for proprietary software vendors who are typically the only 
source to just claim otherwise. Your point might still stand but the 
source is suspect.

Secunia is hardly a reliable source. For one thing, they count on vendor 
accepting something as a vulnerability before listing it. That makes it 
easier for proprietary software vendors who are typically the only 
source to just claim otherwise. Your point might still stand but the 
source is suspect.

Dear friends:

Canonical, Ubuntu's parent company, is finally taking serious action on its long-announced plans to become a serious enterprise Linux player. The Isle of Man-based Linux distributor isn't just targeting data center servers, although that's on its list.

http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2008/080608-ubuntu-goes.html

Should Ubuntu focus on Enterprise or stay with desktop users?

Hi all,
  It seems I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Shirish Agarwal. I'm
based in Pune, Maharashtra, India. I have been using free software for the
last 5-6 years and have had my share of changing distros and taking part in
the various flame-wars.

Moreover, I like to attend various community-driven events and blog about
them and let others know what's going on. You can find about me at
http://flossexperiences.wordpress.com.

Comments and flames are both encouraged ;)

you forgot to add that you also are campaigning to trivialise the  
creative commons license by trying to license all your mails under  
that. Please note that CC is meant for serious creative work and not

Hello Srikrishna,

OpenSuSE 11.0 released version doesn't have KDE 4.1. It has been released
after the 11.0 release. But there are live cd available with KDE 4.1.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0808082055260.14998@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,

I read/learnt that, Python handles very large numbers easily and
gracefully using the long int. For example when C does not handle (2 power
1500) and when Java does not handle (2 power 1500) in normal
scenario(other than BigNum) due to datatype size overflows how python is
able to do that with infinite length number and infinite precision.

I am looking for the algorithm or to learn how Python handles/works with
large numbers. I searched in internet but did not get proper expected
result/theory behind it.

Could someone point me to the correct link where I can learn how python
handles large numbers.

when I did 2**1500 (2 power 1500) in python it resulted nicely in

Python's long int is an arbitrary precision data type -- it's a special
python object and not a native hardware data type.

Python's integer data type is the traditional C long int.

See
    http://docs.python.org/lib/typesnumeric.html
    http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.1/api/longObjects.html

and Python source code:
   Include/longintrepr.h
   Objects/longobject.c

Python handles its arbitrary precision arithmetic internally, see the source
code files mentioned above.  Additional resources for arbitrary precision
arithmetic:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bignum
    http://gmplib.org/


If you are interested in number crunching with python, be sure to check

"Reflect upon your blessings, of which every man has plenty, not on your
past misfortunes, of which all men have some." Charles Dickens


And He gave you of all that you asked for, and if you count the blessings of
Allah, never will you be able to count them. Verily! Man is indeed an
extreme wrong-doer, - a disbeliever (an extreme ingrate, denies Allahs
blessings by disbelief, and by worshipping others besides Allah, and by
disobeying Allah and His Prophet Muhammad SAW). (Surah Ibrahim, Chapter #14,
Verse #34)

could yo upaste the output of "lspci" command here? I might be able to 
help you if I know which cards you have exactly.

As per I understand, you need to load the kernel modules for both wired 
and wireless network cards, which have not been loaded already. You could 
do so using modprobe and ndiswrapper for wireless card.

If you have intel pro wireless 3945, its supported with ndiswrapper, which 
is listed on this page
http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/component/option,com_openwiki/Itemid,33/id,list_g-l/

here is the wiki for ndiswrapper + wireless card module installation
http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/component/option,com_openwiki/Itemid,33/id,installation/

Once you get the modules loaded correctly, you should have your hardware 
working with RHEL.

Thanks

Intel has native linux drivers, ndiswrapper is not needed.
Checkout the 'iwlwifi' driver, it supports both 3945 and 4965 chipsets.

Kenneth,

I think you wanted to say "CC license is perhaps overkill for the content of
your mails." ?

Because who is to say what is "serious creative work" and what is
'run-of-the-mill mails' ... Further why are you trying to police the use of
a license that can be used by anyone freely as per his/her choice. Shirish
owns the copyright of the emails he writes and it is his, only his, business
to give other people permissions on what they can do with the content.
Calling it "campaigning to trivialise the creative commons license" is
attributing motives where, perhaps, none exist.

I do not know the people who are laughing at the CC license after seeing
Shirish's emails. But maybe they need some education too ;)

First of all, please read up the list's posting guidelines.  The subject 
line should be meaningful indicative of your problem.  If everyone 
posts their problem with a subject line like yours then ...

The Tata Indicom USB dongle and Linux has been discussed in many forums.  

Did do any search to find the solution?

A Google search "tata indicom usb modem linux" gave me a solution in the

Message-ID: <c9ea6e770808110307w71c11ca8v4961df74a444b24f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We are planning to setup a Live Backup server for our blog application. The
requirement is that one of the server should act as backup server, and when
the load peaks up, it should share the load.  During normal times, the main
server would be handling all the loads. When the main server fails for some
reason, the backup server should take on automatically, and any data
updation has to be synchronised with the main server, once its up.

We need suggestions, guidance and reference material for achieving this
requirement.

Regards,
Senthil Raja

AFAIK, For load shareing, you may need a 3rd system.

have come up with a distributed data storage layer in python.
Have released the basic version of my work in the following link.
http://code.google.com/p/distributed-python-object-store-for-orms/

Looking forward for your comments.

Thanks,
Shanmuganandh.

On distributed systems, performance can be degraded only due to tcp/unix 
sockets. Try using libevent rather using plain unix sockets.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libevent

Most of the distributed architectures use this for high performance.

sorry i missed some words in the response!

On distributed systems, performance can be degraded only due to tcp/unix 
sockets (select or poll) . Try using libevent rather using select on plain unix sockets.

Hi,

Thanks for your suggestion meendar.
Let me explore that and get back to you.

I used unix sockets since there is no single point server in the 
architecture. So all the client must know complete information about the 
nodes in the cluster. And more over there is not much sync between the 
nodes in the cluster. The communication is always between the client 
(which requests for the data) and not among the data instances.

Since the data is sharded we can not have joins on the data and if we 
require join support we will have to sync with other nodes in the 
cluster and then i think the event/poll will be of great use.

At present i classify the requests into node-level and cluster-level. In 
node-level queries only one data instance is pinged and requested for 
data and in the cluster-level queries all the nodes are pinged and the 
aggregation of results is done at the client end.

Let me know if my reason is correct.

No problem with using unix sockets, since we don't have any other way. 
But the wait for socket connection can done with select/poll, this can 
cost on performance. so i suggested for libevent. It is event 
notifiction system. This Api will watch for the events occured and 
notify you, this supports epoll, kqueue in unix systems which is almost 
faster than normal select/poll.

However if your systems don't create much socket descriptors , you can 
go for select/poll. I didn't walkthrough all of your code, may be you 
don't sync often.  I guess distributed systems might use of large number 
of sockets for synchronizing itself with the master/slave, or send send 
to the client. So i suggested this one.

You need to make sure the code is identical + the machine setup needs to 
also be near identical and make sure there is no user or system state 
being maintained which is local machine specific.

I'd guess you are using a db for state and app-data, so make sure you 
mirror that information to both machines as well. Replication has its 
uses's - many people argue that failover is not one of them. The same 
people argue for shared storage. That comes with its own issues. But see 
what works for you, try different options.

For inbound load sharing you could do some really nice stuff with nginx 
as a http proxy in front of your httpd services. Even load specific or 
time specific policies are trivial to implement. And you get cheap wins 
for things like static content cache's etc.

For the failover/disaster recovery, a shared IP Heartbeat based setup 
works well ( for millions of people ) - if your machines are close 
enough, and the ISP is ok with you setting up something like that, a 
VirtualIP/SharedIP scenario works well.

Finally, most people consder failover/disaster recovery to be orthogonal 
to load sharing and would address system setup based on what role you 
are playing for. If you are small enough, you can dualrole the entire 
infrastructure - but make sure your sysadmins know exactly what is going 
on and how it all works. When disaster recovery policies need to go in, 
it usually means something is quite badly broken :)

play around, if you get stuck or need more info about anything, feel 
free to email!

Message-ID: <939acfd0808111738p44cc3b21m1a9a5a93eab4f172@mail.gmail.com>

Hello geeks,

 I am Rajkumar.R, doing my B.E ECE in Nandha engg college,
Erode,Tamilnadu,India.

      I  am involved  in spreading open source and Linux, and right
now i have made around 62 new Ubuntu users in last 6 months.

      For that reason, i have planed to organize seminars on those
related topics like Linux Vs Windows, Open source, Linux, etc. . so
that young students can get aware of these thing's eventually
spreading open source

      I can organize the complete program in colleges with 100-250
students for these kind of seminars.

      If any one is willing, i can even organize a camp where you can
give practical demonstration's too.

      I have heard about Free Software Foundation's India, is
conducting such camps. .  .But i cant get complete details regarding
this. .


Could any one of you please help me regarding this in any way?

       I will be much thankful if some one could help me to spreed
Linux, and open source  in the minds of emerging new students.

Thanks a lot in advance,

Rajkumar.R

One Day One GNU/Linux Command 
=============================

userdel - Delete a user account and related files

Summary :

The userdel command modifies the system account files, deleting all
entries that refer to login. userdel will not allow you to remove an
account if the user is currently logged in. You must kill any running
processes which belong to an account that you are deleting.

Example:

# userdel usr1 -- Remove the usr1 account entry details. Home Dir will 
                  not be removed.

# userdel -r usr1 -- Remove the account entries, Home Dir and Mail
                     Spool of the usr1.

Besides, the feedback that others have given you about your diclaimer 
lines, you should also *not* recycle messages from an existing thread.   

It messes up threaded views in email clients.  Simply changing the 
subject line is not sufficient.  From what KMail displays, it appears 
you recycled the posting with subject "rubynokii pre alpha 0.1.1 
released..."   The effort required to compose a "new" v/s "recycling" 
is the same.

Coming back to your question, take a close look at the "splashimage=" 
line.  To change the splashimage, you will have to replace the filename 
with the splash image of your choice.

Most of the content still applies. The process is better these days.

You take the srpms, add your patches, bump the version number and 
rebuild the packages. Put them in a separate directory, run createrepo 
on them which will create a yum repository. Point to your custom 
repository along with the existing Fedora repository. Run pungi (for 
regular installation images) or livecd-creator (for live cd/dvd) or use 
revisor for a graphical wrapper around both.

Jesse Keating, release engineer for Fedora has a video/presentation 
talking about the basic concepts behind this

Hi,

I would like to know how to see what locale is set in my Debian etch
box. If I need to set a particular locale how to go about it in Debian
etch? Provided I dont have X server running on the machine.

In Debian etch 'dpkg-reconfigure locales' worked :)

Libevent abstracts the best possible IO multiplexing system possible on
any OS -- epoll, kqueue, /dev/poll, etc -- and makes your code faster,
cleaner and more portable.

If the mobo/nic combo supports PXE boot, you don't have to change the proms.
You can install dnsmasq+syslinux/pxelinux and get started with PXE straight
away.

up to you - workshop would start at around 9 am - the lab already has  
fedora9 - so if you mention what software you need installed you  
could even come in the morning. If you want to install stuff of your  
own, you could either come in the previous evening and set it up - or  
set it up live when giving your talk. Dr Ilango is cc-ed on this mail  
- and the previous one also, so press reply-all and he will get it.

Go to the

 /etc/locale.gen

and add the locale you want or just uncomment the locale you want. then run
this command as root

locale.gen

then you can see what locales are generated..

Fedora 9 is community version and the latest one, Red Hat 9 is very very old. Also by Red Hat, do you mean Red Hat Enterprise Linux? If yes then its commercial version with no free support. Go for Fedora 9, though it has some issues with network manager. You may try Mandriva which is also rpm based and very popular distro.

I've been using the kmdl module and userland apps from atrpms.net for my 
ipw3945abg interface, perhaps try that ? or rpmforge also has the 
modules and userland code for this.

Look at http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Laptops/Wireless - there are hints 
there on howto get the install from rpmforge.

Hope this helps

hi,
am trying to set up ltsp with mandriva2008.1. The dhcp reports  
request from client and offers lease. But client is not booting.  
Client is exporting PXE. Obviously dhcpd is not pointing client to

What is the message in the client?
Is it catching the ip first but then stops searching for something?

If it is dhcp3 an entry next-server may be required in the dhcpd.conf file like

next-server  ip-address  # where ip address is that of the server

I don't know about PXE boot. I guess it is using tftp service to boot from a
file located in remote server. and I guess you are trying to configure these
two parameters in your DHCP server.

Hope this link will be useful:

Does log contains granting IP address to this client? 
If granted and not caught by client check for next-server entry.

Is dhcp running?
check using 
on the server 
netstat -an|grep ":67"

I suppose most rhel rpms will be compatible with fedora. But if you are
running a server, try centos instead. It is a repackaged version of RHEL

This was an old solution I posted on this mailing list..

Warning... I used it when fedora 3 and ubuntu 5.04 wree shiny!

I have myself found out the solution

create a wvdial.conf file in /etc using nano or vi with sudo
then copy the following to the file
[Dialer Defaults]
Modem = /dev/ttyS0
Baud = 115200
SetVolume=0
Init1 = ATZ
Init2 = AT+CRM=1
ISDN = 0
Modem Type = Analog Modem
FlowControl=Hardware(CRTSCTS)
 Phone = #777
 Username = <phone no>
 Password = <phone no>
Stupid Mode=1

Then create /etc/resolv.conf using vi or nano with sudo
type:
nameserver 202.138.103.100
nameserver 202.138.96.2


THIS SPECIFIES THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DNS SERVERS.
Then in terminal type sudo wvdial and bingo you are on.

I suggest you use dnsmasq. It can handle DNS DHCP and BOOTP. The best part
is that the configuration is darn simple. Here is a full dnsmasq config file
I use, comments, free:



##########################################################
# Specify the IP Range to be allocated for Nodes
# Please note that the interface(s) on which dnsmasq is
# being run on need to be on the same subnet as the
# range specified. For example if eth0 is 192.168.1.10 and
# the range you have specified is 10.0.0.x, then, dnsmasq
# will not dish out IP addresses!
##########################################################
dhcp-range=10.0.0.2,10.0.0.250,12h


##########################################################
# Option 3 of the dhcp options specifies the default route
# ip address
##########################################################
#dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.1

##########################################################
# Option 6 of the dhcp options specifies a name server
# ip address
##########################################################
#dhcp-option=6,10.0.0.1


##########################################################
# PXE boot options
##########################################################
dhcp-boot=pxelinux.0
enable-tftp
tftp-root=/tftpd
conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d

--------->8--------------------->8---------------->8-----------

Install pxelinux in /tftp and you are off! And don't miss instructions in
the dnsmasq comments.

All the best!

What is the error message you get? Can you run the Live CD? Have you checked the media for errors? What is the stage where Ubuntu stops on the laptop?

I haven't tried running the live cd.
When I try to install, it says copying files and the process freezes.
Had a similar problem when I tried to install Mandriva from LFY. There

If you have good RAM -- anuything more than 512 -- always try to run live, That way you know how much of the hardware is being supported and you wont end up installing a crippled OS.

Will wait for more info. If you are trying with DVD, try in text install mode.

maybe, nitpicking, but how is this (aug 16 1993) the birthday of debian? it is 
merely the day on which it was announced - the (practically unusable) release 
came later. somewhat usable releases came only sometime in the next year. 
those were the days when sls was king, soon to be replaced by slackware. the 
first version of this mailing list server (long before the mailing list came 
to exist) was a result of switching over from sls to slackware ...

yes, please check that out; can you find anything in there that contradicts 
what i have posted? let me repeat, debian was only announced on aug 16 1993 - 
you can even google for the original posting and it says precisely that 
(impending release or imminent release is the wording in the original posting, 
i believe). celebrating the day of announcement as debian day is quite fine, 
but calling it the birthday is a stretch, no? the 'unusable' release came soon 
after. and when i say unusable, i mean like ls does not work. and, i did open 
my post with, "maybe, nitpicking".

Related but hijacking the thread.

It is curious how the 'Debian' name came about.

Ian Murdock's girlfriend who he perhaps later married. ;)

Debrah is her name.

(weird English this)

Now it is left as an exercise how the name came about. ;)

A very nice sounding name I must admit.

Message-ID: <200808171925.22120.knura@yahoo.com>

I have created an "announcement" list, wherein only a "set" of members 
are allowed to post to the list.

Currently, I have done it by restricting all members to be "moderated" 
along with the "reject" option and manually disabling the "moderated" 
bit only for those members in the "set."  

The above works but I was wondering if there is another way of achieving 
the above.

I did go through the mailman configs but nothing caught my eye.

They have a small budget for switching costs, so while volunteer support is preferred, they are willing to pay for commercial support. Please contact me if you are interested in helping.

ODF is already an accepted ISO standard, so now we have 2 standards.

# usermod -G grp1,grp2,grp3  user

User is added to this list of groups. Note: If the user is currently a
member of a group which is not listed, then the user will be removed
from the group.

hi,

I am planning to buy a digital voice recorder and a digital  
projector. They should be out-of-the-box linux compatible and  
reasonably priced. Could people with experiences with these devices  
give some pointers?

Dear All
The solution to the below mentioned issue has been addressed sucessfully by following the guidelines mentioned
at   http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories/RPMForge?action=show&redirect=Repositories%2FRPMForge  and also at  http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Laptops/Wireless
The irony is that the deficient RPM found in RHEL Supplementary DVD is still not traceable and hence I had to take help
from aforesaid links.
I wish to thank one and all for your valuable inputs and suggestions.
with thanks and regards

yes, but if and only if you know exactly the changes to be made.  the 
preferred method would be to use the utils included in the system.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

groupmod -- Modify a group

Summary : 

The groupmod command modifies the system account files to reflect the
changes that are specified on the command line.

Example:

# groupmod -g 600 mygrp -- Change the mygrp Group ID to 600.

# groupmod -n mygrp1 mygrp -- Change the mygrp name to mygrp1.

Group informations are stored in /etc/group files.

Read: man groupmod

Dear LUGs,
               Oracle 10g R2 enterprise edition installation on Open SUSE 11
is very simple. I found the documentation in the following link.

I guess this is the correct way of setting up announce-only mailing
lists. You may change `reject' to `discard', and disable the automatic
reject/discard notification depending on local policy.

Dear Ravi,

I am practising the linux commands suggested by you daily. I have lot of
issues in linux. Kindly help me in fixing the problems :

I have BOSS linux (www.bosslinux.in) in my home PC. Google Earth is not
working in BOSS Linux. I am able to execute it. But when the earth ball is
about to be displayed, the system automatically goes to the login prompt.

unable to install xine in suse linux 10

Is there any linux equivalent testing software to Window based Sysmark 2007
? Sysmark 2007 is a windows based application which will test the CPU and
other motherboard devices and tell us whether the system enhances the
productivity or not. I am assisting my superior in evaluating computers
which have to be supplied to various customers. As ELCOT has the habit of
arm-twisting the vendors to supply at dead cheap prices, vendors may act
smart on us by supplying the goods at a lesser standard. So to test the
deliverables that we had asked for, we use some evaluating softwares. One of
them is Sysmark 2007. it is a windows based software. We are looking for a
linux equivalent software.

In the meantime I downloaded Ubuntu 8.04 from the net and had installed in
one of our office machines. Installation went smooth.

If you train me on installing skype with voice and / or video, I will remove
windows from my home PC and install ubuntu.

Please mail me the feedback on the assessment.

have the source with me but is there any way i can compile the code and
install in my system and see how it works. If not on my physical computer
atleast on a virtual machine like qemu, or virtualBox. I really want to

Dear friends,

As most of you are aware of my problem with Sify. The problem has not been solved yet. While I can access the Internet using Windows, I cannot do the same with GNU/Linux distros.

Should I not file a case with Consumer Forum? What do you suggest?

Swapnil

Swapnil,

Lets have a final check from ourside.

1. Which distro you are using? or list the distros you tested?

2. Did you test with live CD? Which applications are connecting and
which are not connecting?

3. Are you able to connect to sites after changing User Agent string in
firefox? (http://johnbokma.com/mexit/2004/04/24/changinguseragent.html)

4. What is the output of 'ifconfig', 'route', /etc/resolv.conf,
traceroute <unabletoopensite>, ping <unabletoopensite>, iptables -L

5. What nmap says about your gateway('nmap <yourdefaultgateway>'). is it
all filtered?

It will be useful if you share your answers with ilugc for the above
questions. If someone have better idea to trace the culprit, please help
swapnil to figure out.

Regards,
Mohan R

I am pretty sure the Sify exe will work with WINE in Linux Distros.

I'll try to demonstrate virtualization using Xen. Xen is a fairly
simple operating system that acts as a hypervisor that other OSes can
run on top of it.
Virtualization is a technique by which mutiple guest operating system
can be allowed to be run on a base operating system

Go to skype.com and download the skype for ubuntu 7.04, which will be
a .deb packaged. Give the following command,

sudo dpkg -i <.deb package name>

This will install the skype for you. For launching app, type alt+f2
and give skype in it.

Ubuntu (permanent OS), Debian 4.0, Mandriva, PS LinuxOS, Fedora 9, Suse11.0
(Strange thing under Gnome while my net is blacked out, I cannot run search on Google while on KDE, Google does show search results but cudn't open pages)

Tested with live CD also. Even on stalled OS, while I cannot browse the net, other applications like PidGin, Azureus can connect to net and download stuff. Also while net is blacked out I can open site like Microsoft.com and download.com (why is this happening) I tested telnet and port 80 is open.

Are you able to connect to their repositories to download any
softwares? Last time I tried it things were hopeless, I could not
download anything off their servers. They were perpetually down.

Do you have DRI enabled?

I haven't seen any such equivalent softwares but there's a
benchmarking suite called phoronix test suite[1] which conducts some
basic tests like compiling software, drawing patterns using opengl.
You can conduct the tests using this suite and compare benchmarks. I
haven't used it extensively to conclusively say how good it is though.

Well you can install latest version of skype from the ubuntu
repositories. I believe it is not available in official repositories
so you will have to check the documents for installation procedure.
You can check ubuntu help page[2] for further details.

I am not sure if you logic is true or not but you can try obtaining
old versions of various distros like slackware from ibiblio[1]
archives and install it and try.

Summary : 

The groupdel command modifies the system account files, deleting all
entries that refer to group.

Example:

# groupdel mygrp -- Remove all entries about the mygrp.

Note:
1) The named group must exist.
2) You may not remove the primary group of any existing user. You
   must remove the user before you remove the group.

Beware of service providers who provide you a private IP address and NAT
you out to the internet.  It's impossible for you to host
web/ftp/ssh/etc on your
machine and access it from the internet.  Many ISPs offer you a public IP
address and stay out of your way.

Beware of ISPs who outsource their last mile service to other
organizations -- you'll get very poor onsite technical support.  Sify website
mentions that last mile service is outsourced to cable TV operators, who
in my opinion, are generally clueless about computer networking.

Perhaps a better course of action is to dump Sify and move to a different
ISP that does not have these shortcomings?

Compilation should work but you probably need an older version of gcc
(2.95 may be enough). I suspect 0.11 will not compile otherwise.

I think that the newer kernels are _better_ organised for readability
than the older ones. Though the source size has increased, it is well
structured and there are many guides on the net on how to go about
reading the code.

Of course, it is _not_ a toy kernel anymore. This means that there
are many aspects of the kernel that are advanced as compared with
0.11 which is a much simpler kernel.

Regards,

Kapil.

Usually, there _is_ a base operating system which is called the host.

The tasks of the host are (at least):
 a. To make it convenient to create and manage guests.
 b. To manage hardware access for the hosts.

On a "base (or host) operating system". 

VM has been there on mainframes for a long time (the Big Iron has a 
layer of "base" OS to host multiple instances of guest OSs).  Only in 
the past few years, with advances in desktop CPU arch. and lower memory 
cost, it has come to commodity PC hardware.

I will throw a few rupees worth information with whatever little I know
of virtualization.

Xen is a marvelous creation. And it beats VMWare hands down. I will say
why. I could have some outdated info here. VMWare might have caught up.
But at least this is what I know from what I learnt a year or so ago.

Typical case of OS running on bare metal (which is CPU, memory and
peripherals) is different from a virtualized environment in the sense
that the bare metal (hardware resources) is managed by a hypervisor.
The real OS has to make hypercalls to use the 'bare metal resources'
instead of accessing directly in the normal case.

Now the definition of an OS as taught in colleges is performed by the
hypervisor. So technically speaking we can call it an OS. At least a
slimmed down OS.

But the hypervisor is far from enough to do something useful. So we have
to have a real OS like NetBSD or GNU/Linux running as DOM0 over the Xen
hyervisor. So this is typically called the host OS. The DOMUs are known
as guest OSes. Many OSes have been ported to run on top of Xen.

x86 platforms come with four levels of protection for the purpose of
memory management. Ring 0, 1 , 2 and 3. Normally kernel runs in ring 0
with highest freedom and liberty. And userspace processes run at ring 3.
Whereas in the case of Xen, all four levels are used.

Now the main difference between Xen and VMWare is this:

   " Xen does not emulate the underlying hardware completely. This
means that OSes have to be modified to run on top of Xen hypervisor. You
can never run an OS directly over Xen. Whereas VMWare does full hardware
virtualization which is a highly complex task. Thereby Xen achieves a
very high level of performance when compared to VMWare. But VMWare's
approach means that you don't have to modify the OS to run on top of 
VMWare. "

So the design and code of VMWare and Xen are wildly different since the
goals though similar follow somewhat antipodal approaches.

There are other forms of emulators like Bochs and qemu which I regularly
use. This should not be confused with virtualization. qemu tries to
emulate the bare metal. But this happens at a very high level.

Thanks.

I'd rather put an old OS under virtualisation and have fun with it, it
will be low on resources anyways. Only thing is OS should work.

Then, to check if the problem was something in my KDE dotfiles, I
moved away my .kde and tried again, but it failed once more. Finally,
I created a new user and added that user to most of the relevant
groups (inclding plugdev), but I still failed to get it working.

Most of the forum posts I have read suggest one of the solutions I
seem to have tried above already, and really wonder how to proceed.
Could someone make any suggestion, please?

The relevant packages with their versions:
ii  kdebase-kio-plugins   4:3.5.9.dfsg.1-5      core I/O slaves for KDE
ii  udev                  0.125-5               /dev/ and hotplug
management daemon
ii  hal                   0.5.11-2              Hardware Abstraction Layer
ii  dbus           1.2.1-3        simple interprocess messaging system

I should also mention that on one occasion immediately after I noticed
that automount had stopped working, it suddenly worked when I
restarted X, but not since.

Thanks very much.

Whats MSNL?!! If you mean BSNL, I have been using it for 4 years now
-at distant Avadi - without a glitch except for once when the BSNL
cable got damaged because of digging by somebody else. Other than that
incident, I have never had to contact them. It just works.

It was a typo. I apologize. I meant MTNL. Some of the friends suggested that when down it could be a mess to get rectifies, thus I asked. If you have a good experience with them, then I will definitely give them a try.
Does it need some tweaking to make GNU/Linux work on it, or it works out of the box?

Thanks a lot Mano for suggestion :-)

Dear All,
        I gladly inform you that, BioPuppy Linux is now encouraged by one of
the Debian project called Debian-Med. The Debian-Med project presents
packages that are associated with medicine, pre-clinical research, and life
science. Its developments are mostly focused on three areas for the moment:
medical practice, imaging and bioinformatics.

BioPuppy is a preferable Linux OS for Debian-Med project to add all the
debian Bioinformatics packages into BioPuppy Linux. For more details about
Debian-Med project, http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed

Dear ILUG members. I am expecting contributors for BioPuppy project from
Bioinformatics field. Let me know any one from bioinfo and please, if you
know any one from out of this ILUG, inform about it to them.

They give you an ADSL router with an ethernet port (also a USB port)
on the LAN side. Works out of the box.

Thanks I will try that. But an interesting thing happened -- something I always do. The Sify engineer that came to my place to rectify the problem. I bombarded him so much with GNU/Linux thing that he ended up returning a DVD of Ubuntu which I burnt for him. Right now he is installing it. I did same with the earlier engineer :P

is this so in Xen 3.1 running on top of a Intel VT supported architecture?

I heard that  running an OS with out changing it is now possible with the
above mentioned combination which is why CITRIX has bought Xen source .

I might have heard wrong but could some one shed some light on this please

Not really. VMWare has a hypervisor based solution for quite sometime now.

http://www.vmware.com/products/vi/esx/

If you compare the model of VMWare ESX and Xen, they are quite similar 
where they both have mini operating systems running as hypervisors. What 
is different is the KVM one where Linux itself as a "hypervisor"

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

file -- Try to determine the FILE type.

Summary:

File tests each argument in an attempt to classify it. There are 3
sets of tests, performed in this order: File System Test, Magic 
Number Test, and Language Test.

File System test will examine the return value of the stat(2) system
call, to see if the file is empty, or a special file (block, char,
pipe, dir, link, socket,..).

Magic Number test will try to match the file with particular fixed
formats. For example, a binary executable files will have magic number
in some fixed position to indicate the OS, that file is executable.
Few standard data files also following the magic number concept.

Language Test will try to find the file char set like ASCII, UTF-8,
ISO-8859-x, etc,. Once file has determined the character set used in a
text-type file, it will attempt to determine in what (prg) language
the file is written.

Unidentified file will be classified as DATA file.

Example:

$ file myfile -- Print the file type.

$ file -b myfile -- Don't show the filename in the output.

$ file -f list -- Take the input filenames (one per line) from the 
                  file 'list'.

$ file -k myfile -- Print all matches. 

$ file -z myfile.tgz -- Try to look into compressed file.

$ file -i myfile -- Print the output in MIME format.

$ file -m mymagic myfile -- Use custom magic file.

# file -s /dev/hda? -- Take blk/char special files as an argument.

Read: man file

in Xen, would you call Dom0 the host?
Dom0, a special domain (VM) too runs on top of Xen
ESX, COS is not the host as VMkernel runs the hardware
Here too, COS is a special VM running on top of VMkernel.
There is also something similar in Hyper-V


In Hypervisor based Virtualisation Softwares, I do think the control consoles
are host as they do not really host the VMs. They can just communicate with
the Virtualization Layer which other user created VMs cannot. And Hypervirsor
based virtualizations softwares are installed on bare metal.

Of course, VirtualBox, VMware server, VPC all needs bases OS as the host.
Yes, the tasks you mentioned are right.

You are right about the fact that even Dom0 is "only"
a special domain.

My statement was made from a usage perspective rather than
as strict logical dependency.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

ln -- Make LiNks between files.

Summary : 

Create a link to the specified TARGET with optional LINK_NAME. If
LINK_NAME is omitted, a link with the same basename as the TARGET is
created in the current directory. By default, it makes HardLinks.

A "hard link" is another name for an existing file. The link and the
original are share the same inode. So indistinguishable.

A SoftLinks/SymbolicLinks/symlinks are a special file type. The link
file actually refers to a different file, by name. At runtime kernel
automatically "dereferences" the link and operates on the target of
the link.

Example:

$ ln --help -- Show help info.

$ ln A B -- Creates hard link B for file A.  

$ ln -b A B -- Same as above. If B is already exist then take a backup
               (B~) and creates new B.

$ ln -b -S .bak A B -- Same as above. If B is already exist then take 
        a backup with specified extension name(B.bak) & creates new B.

$ ln -f A B -- Force. If B is exist then overwrite it.

$ ln -i A B -- Interactive. Prompt the user for removing the already 
               existing file B.

$ ln -s A B -- Creates soft link B for file A.

$ ln -s dir1/myfile -- Creates link ./myfile pointing to dir1/myfile.

$ ln -s dir1/myfile myfile -- Creates link ./myname pointing to 
                               dir1/myfile.

$ ln -s a b .. -- Creates links ../a and ../b pointing to ./a & ./b

Read: man ln

Message-ID: <200808221223.44166.knura@yahoo.com>

Anyone tried installing Ubuntu/Linux Mint on an Intel Atom cpu based 
system?  FWIW, the motherboard model is D945GCLF.

I have copied the LiveCD iso, Ubuntu 8.04.1 and Linux Mint 5r1 (using a 
special tool unetbootin-eeeubuntu-linux-238) to a 1GB USB pen drive.  

The system boots from the LiveUSB, grub loads with it's menu.  It boots 
the kernel but then the system drops into an "initramfs" prompt with a 
busybox prompt.

I have also verified the LiveUSB pen drive on my ASUS eeePC, the netbook 
boots with both the Live distros.

Any ideas/clues what could be wrong?

Note that the internal disk of the EEE Pc is also a USB disk so your
initramfs may be getting confused as to where the root file system
is.

I had this problem while booting a USB disk on the EEE Pc. Changing
the location of the root device to /dev/sd[bc]* fixed the problem for
me.

problem solved. when I ran ltspadmin, I did not notice that it does  
not create a dhcpd.conf file - it creates a sample file which has to  
be merged into dhcpd.conf. Once that was done, the client could not  
find the vmlinuz file. The file was in the /tftpboot/lts/ directory -  
and the dhcpd.conf file had the filename = "/lts/vmlinuz.whatever".  
When I removed the leading '/', everything worked. So for ltsp in  
Mandriva 2008.1 the steps are:

1. download and install ltsp-utils
2. run ltspadmin, install all components
3. configure the components with ltspadmin
4. merge the dhcpd.conf.sample into dhcpd.conf
5. enjoy

actual work is about 10 minutes + time taken to download the files

You have misunderstood my problem.  I don't have any issue with booting 
the eeePC off of a LiveUSB pen drive.  In fact, my eeePC is booted up 
with Linux Mint 5r1 off of a USB pen drive as I write this message.  
This eliminates the possibility that the image on the pen drive could 
be corrupted.

Using the *same* pen drive, I am unable to boot another system that I 
have integrated using the DG945GCLF miniITX mobo that has an integrated 
Atom 230 cpu.  This system does *not* have any hard/optical disk but 
for the USB pen drive inserted into an external port.

The BIOS detects the USB pen drive as a HDD block device and I have set 
the BIOS to boot from USB block devices.  It does boot but drops down 
to an initramfs (busybox) prompt.

I hope I have clarified my problem.

This is for ltsp version 4.x. This old and no longer maintained.

On ubuntu, debian it is just apt-get install ltsp-server.

>From ltsp5 onwards ltsp has changed its design. It now uses the
distributions imaging tools to create the OS. It also uses ssh
for client to server connection. It has local device support.

Unfortunately for Mandriva, nobody has taken up the work. Its very well developed in ubuntu, debian and suse. Fedora is fast catching up.

A good project for Mandrake to start.

         This command makes mirror of file. You can edit both of them. It
will automatically update in another one. to delete the file you should
remove the both.

$ ls -s A B

         This command creates only shortcut(link). Original file only
available one to work.

It is not mirroring, no physical copying is done. The entry about A and B in the directory structure will point to same file. The physical file remains just single with its link count in inode increased. This type of link is called hard link

It is not short cut, it is called symbolic link. Symbolic link uses filename itself instead of inode number to maintain relationship. You can use both A and B for work.

Hi,

I use the same DG945GCLF with Damn Small Linux USB pen drive. It works
except for the network card which was not detected by DSL. Open SUSE 10.3
detects the net card but no sound. In fact the sound card is detected but I
can't make it work.

did you try root=/dev/sda1 (or the equiv partition in the USB disk?)
also rootdelay=3 (wait for 3 seconds for the kernel to detect the usb disk)
in the kernel parameters?

Arun

The hardware is good however it is still something attractive to 
developers and not a model for consumers. You probably want to wait for 
a revision or two if you are interested in hacking it.

I've been using the FreeRunner phone for a couple of weeks with Qtopia
edition on micro-SD card with Airtel prepaid.

Sending/receiving calls and SMS works well with the
qtopia-4.3.2-gta02-rootfs-07221045.tar.gz image. With suspend set to
40s, I am able to get battery life of 12 hours (will improve in next
hardware release). Media player and bluetooth works. GPS for Qtopia
will be available in 4.4 edition only. But, GPS and accelerometers are
available in the OM2008.8 image.

I think if you download and install Tk which always comes bundled with
Tcl and then compile python, the configure script of python will catch
this and you will be all set.

I remember compiling python once. It is not hard.

This is encouraging.  May I ask what has been your experience with this 
board besides the network and sound issues?  A dual core Atom cpu was 
announced recently available with the DG945GCLF2 motherboard; the L2 
cache has been raised to 1MB on each core.

I was thinking of trying different distros and plan to download the 
openSUSE LiveCD and CentOS LiveCD.

Will try this as well.

BTW, I have an external CD-DVD/ROM.  I removed the USB pen drive and 
tried booting from the LiveCD (Linux Mint 5r1) same problem.

I will also trying connecting a CDROM directly on the IDE port and see 
if the problem persists with LiveCDs.

Thanks.

Hello,

Not sure, whether you are asking me, why I posted my comments on top of the

Hi Arun,

What kind of memory are you using i.e. DDR2 533 or 667?  

I went by their spec. info 
<http://www.intel.com/products/desktop/motherboards/D945GCLF/D945GCLF-overview.htm>
and ordered a DDR2 2GB 667 DIMM.

Do you want to block certain clients from accessing banned sites?

DHCP leases can be configured at the DHCP server and instructed to dish
out a particular IP address for a given MAC address.

That way you can tackle the source IP based policy enforcement problem.

I wanted to use Damn small linux but could not because of the net card
issue. I had to switch to OpenSUSE. I did not need sound and so I have
no problems for this project. I have used 2 of these boards on
production systems (both for data acquisition and control). They are
working great. Really went for this board on the form factor.
Incredibly small and I could put the SMPS, Motherboard and a harddisk
in our own electronics enclosure! The system runs apache and postgres
and the data is eventually (work in progress) going  to be accessed
through a browser interface (currently through Postgres database). One
system is up 24X7 and the other during working shifts... Its been
running for about 2 months.

I have one problem though - ifconfig shows an incredibly large amount
of dropped RX packets! But the system is stable and has never crashed.
What could be this problem?

I think it is best to test with a Live CD from a internel IDE port
first. Also if you are not going to use SATA, disable SATA completely
in the BIOS setup. I have seen very strange problems when booting from
USB with SATA enabled motherboards....

Arun

 A user if not logged in, and edits, then his ip address is recorded in a
wiki.
You mean how to block such users of a wiki hosted on the internet ?

Ok, the IP address of the user 'A' who did nasty things has been recorded is
black list of wiki. If A is using dynamic IP address means he will be given
different IP address whenever he restarts his mechine isn't it ?

So How  you can ban this guy from accessing wiki ? becaues when he comes for
second time he  may be having different IP address isnt it ?

On the other side the IP address recored by wiki may be given to some other
legimate users by DHCP server, now he may not access the wiki isn't it ?.

so i could understand that a  person with dynamic IP cant be blocked by wiki
or drupal is it ?

I just see 2 ways
1) Disallow anonymous addition/editing, so only registered users can
add/edit the content, if the user creates mischief, he/she can be
banned. But, there is no way to stop them from re-registering
2) Keep moderating for bad additions/edits, and remove/revert them.

How did that error start? Did you try installing removing something manually?

Message-ID: <3BE43407-65D6-4DE6-85D9-2815CAC4F56C@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

steps for installation:
1. as root type tail -f /var/log/messages
2. insert usb modem and note the device - usually /dev/ttyACM0
3. start KPPP
4. for modem select the device above, do not touch other modem settings
5. authentication PAP/CHAP
6. username: internet
7. password: internet
8. Phone number #777

next step depends whether your machine is on a lan or not. If not,
10. Choose fixed IP address: 192.168.1.0, netmask: 255.255.255.0
11. Gateway: 192.168.10
if it is on LAN
10. choose 'get ip address from dhcp'
11. choose automatic for gateway

save and click on connect. You may need to adjust the firewall to sit  
on ppp0 and not on eth0

this should be gateway: 192.168.1.0 (same as fixed IP address)

Dear all,

I successfully installed skype and then restarted the system. Then came the
startx problem. I checked the gdm also. I tried to restart it but it fails
to do the same. I tried sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart :

* Stopping GNOME Display Manager . .
.                                                                 [OK]
* Starting GNOME Display Manager . . .
                           [fail]

For startx command:


xauth: error while loading shared libraries: libXau.so.6: cannot open shared
object file: No such file or directory.

So at the end of the day, operation was successful (skype installation in
ubuntu 8.04), but the patient's life (ubuntu 8.04 ) is .......... miserable.

I did this work in my friend's laptop. Kindly help me in fixing the bug.

Thanks and regards,
A V Bharath Kumar

Classes are passe. Gone forever from the face of Internet.

Today it is CIDR.

You could have an IP 192.168.0.1  but not an IP that ends in .0 like
192.168.1.0 since both 192.168.1.255 and 192.168.1.0 are used for 
broadcast.

I think /proc would give you what you're looking for.

More specifically, have a look at:
/proc/<pid>/limits

<pid> is the process id of the task you're interested in.

Hope this helps.

So are the RFCs on network classes obseleted?

> Today it is CIDR.

True, but still you cannot randomly pick IP blocks for assignments 
within your network. Contiguous blocks are split or consolidated with 
sub/super netting.

Even in CIDR,  all 0s in "host bits" identifies the network (e.g. .0 
for /24) and all 1s in "host bits" is the broadcast (e.g. .255 
for /24).  For routing table entries I (and have seen others) use .0 
for network and not .255.  Maybe for ping purpose .0 and .255 
tantamount to broadcast?

Hi all,

Like a common person, I also wanted to see the closing ceremony of
olympics. But there is no TV in my room. Plan B, Internet. Started with
google.

1. search 'olympics 2008'
2. google gave http://en.beijing2008.cn/.
3. look for any video link. In the right, I saw one option, 'select your
country/region'
4. I selected india.
5. Hanngggg!!! I saw the message "This Channel is not available in your
country". But the page is present when I checked after Olympics started.
And I watched some good videos(especially lezak giving helping
legs(4x100) to phelps to achive his 8 gold, Jamaica's Fastest Horse
Usain Bolt's dance). But what happend at the final day?

Anyway, Firefox is here, and installed 'switch proxy'. I used this link
'http://www.samair.ru/proxy/type-01.htm' to setup proxies. First I tried
with China, I'm able to surf their pages, but no use, mms:// not
correctly worked with mplayer, second Australia, But in the list it gave
only one transparent proxy which is refusing connection. then I ended in
South America(Brazil, Argentena, Columbia). Their terra network showed
that fireworks and jacky chan's beautiful song and a 6min news clip
about the closing ceremony.

All we need is to watch those 2 or 3 min clips. But why so many
restrictions? copyrights, nbc/microsoft/silverlight, EuroVision's
regional restrictions, Is Internet really a one global network?

Mohan R.

You have to be incredibly naive to believe it ever was completely. There 
has always been pockets of proprietary and patent encumbered 
technologies. The spread of Flash, Silverlight etc is making it worse.

There has been some glimmer of hope at times. The recent news of Firefox 
3.1 planning to include ogg support directly is a potential boon.

Content has to follow however.

It is a rule.  In general, the  IPv4_number/no_of_bits defines the 
network id.  The remainder bits define the "no of hosts" possible in 
that network.  All 0s in "host field" reserved for the network and all 
1s in "host field" reserved for broadcast.

For example a.b.c.d/24 defines a 24 bit mask, a.b.c.0 is the network id 
and a.b.c.255 is the broadcast.

so what happens if I give 192.168.1.0 as the ip for a machine on a  
lan (have been doing this for 10 years or more so far)?

as most of you are aware of my ongoing problem with SIfy, today I got hold of an engineer to sit with me while the Internet was down. He found that one PC on the network was throwing virus and during that period the Internet blacks out on GNU/Linux machines while Windows are OK. He suggested, as he was not much expert on Linux. that when my OS detects virus on the network, it filters the data thus stops the connection. Could anyone please suggest if I need to change some policies regarding this?

Thanks in advance

This does not make sense at all.. Machine does not throw virus.. OS does 
not detect virus. Internet can black out for various reasons. It looks 
to me like you are in a LAN environment. I do not know how the internet 
is shared between machines.. but the likely culprit is the internet 
sharing rather than virus.

Vaidhy

Stake Holder Meeting @ Chennai:
------------------------------
Date : Thu Aug 28th 2008
Time : 10AM to 1PM
Place: Intellectual Property Office, Guindy

---------- Forwarded message ----------
From: Dr. Sasi Kumar V

The Indian Patent Office has brought out a Manual that tells people
that software in combination with hardware can be patented. This is
patently false (no pun intended). The Indian Parliament had rejected
in 2005 an attempt to introduce software patents and out efforts had
ensured that the clause that permitted software in combination with
hardware was also rejected. As everyone knows, SOFTWARE IS OF USE ONLY
ALONG WITH HARDWARE. We are again facing a similar threat, though this
time from the bureaucracy.

Details can be found at http://ipindia.nic.in/

The draft manual is at
http://ipindia.nic.in/ipr/patent/DraftPatent_Manual_2008.pdf

A stake-holders' meeting is scheduled at Chennai for 28th morning.
Interested organisations should attend and present their points of
view. FSF India had participated in the meeting in Mumbai. A similar
meeting in Bangalore seems to have been cancelled. There will be a
meeting in Kolkata after the Chennai meeting.

I also faced similar problem with Sify, some years ago and I dont think its
because of virus, the Sify client sends some information about the OS to the
server. There in the server side they have an option to enable the clients
to connect from windows by default, only if asked they will  enable the
Linux , may be it sounds crazy but thats what i experienced. if you change
the Linux distro again this enabling thing has to be done. may be talk about
this stuff to someone in the customer care. may be try this cheap trick,
connect to the server using windows client, remove the cable reboot to linux
and try browsing.

Aren't you confusing this with Mileap? Otherwise there is no way to

I don't understand what you mean by key U and I? The letter keys "u"
and "i"? This would point to a defective keyboard which cannot be
fixed by software hacking (in general).

In any case, the key events are trapped and shown by "xev" which can
be used to find the key events generated by unknown keys.

If these keys do not generate key events then you probably need to
see if they generate console key events using "showkey".

Please read "man xev" and "man showkey" _before_ invoking these
commands so that you can figure out how to quit from them!

Regards,

Kapil.

You are correct. I have got my IP bypassed and now I use browser based login, so that problem was solved. The engineer was sitting here and monitored that when that particular user came online, my Linux stopped browsing, the moment that user logged off, my browsing became normal. Yes, sify connects us through LAN. so please suggest.

It seems to me like you have an IP conflict with that particular 
machine. I am guessing one of you hardcoded the IP while other is using 
dhcp which assigns the same IP. If that is the case, make sure everyone 
is using dynamic IP. Or, make sure the local IP addresses are unique 
within the network. Let me know how it goes.

All already done, we use dynamic IP. That user's PC has virus which is disruption the network, but only Linux machines cannot browse.

This is in reference to Bharathi Subramaniam's post on Stake holder meet 
in Chennai 28/Aug/08.

FYI - Dr. Nagarjuna's note from the Mumbai Stake holder's meet (held on 
7/Aug/08).

The important point to note - there is going to be a special stake 
holders meeting to hear all views on software patents.  It will be held 
in Bangalore (date TBA on the ministry's web portal 
http://ipindia.nic.in/).

Subject: [ILUG-BOM] report on the stake holders meeting
Date: Friday 08 Aug 2008
From: "Nagarjuna G." <nagarjun@gnowledge.org>
To: "The Linux-Delhi mailing list" 
<ilugd@lists.linux-delhi.org>, "GNU/Linux Users Group, Mumbai, India" 
<linuxers@mm.glug-bom.org>

I attended the stake holders meeting in Mumbai at the Patent's office.
The room was full of people, more than 80 people attended the meet.  Of
which about 30 were interested in the software issue.  the rest of them 
are interested mostly in bioinformatics, chemical processes etc.

What gave me solace is that this is not an attempt to modify the law.  
So, status quo exists.  software patents per se are not possible in 
India. However.  what the office is doing is it prepared a draft of a 
Manual helping the inventors in how to apply for a patent.  In that 
manual, there is an attempt to suggest how to exploit the 'per se' and 
apply for software patents in combination with hardware.

Due to several questions on this issue raised by several of us, and also 
due to written feedback submitted by quite a few others in Delhi meet, 
they are organizing a stake holders meeting in Bangalore later (in the 
coming three to four months period) where they are going to settle all 
the doubts and listen all the points of view.

The date of bangalore meeting is not yet announced.  Meanwhile, chennai 
and kolkatta meetings are still going to be held before the bangalore 
meeting. It is a good idea to send our supporters to both these places, 
so that the officers must see that there is sufficient opposition to 
this manipulation.

How many systems do you have in your network?

I conducted a small experiment with 3 physically different systems in my 
LAN:

system A: ip no. 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.1.255  (original 192.168.1.68)

system B: ip no. 192.168.1.232/24

system C: ip no. 192.168.1.7 (print server)

When system A is set to 192.168.1.0 or 192.168.1.255:

   On system A ping -c5 192.168.1.0 or 192.168.1.255 insists on -b 
option.  With -b option ping returns message from self.

   On system B ping -c5 192.168.1.0 or 192.168.1.255 insists on -b 
option when added returns message from system C.

   On system B "ssh arunk@192.168.1.0" or "ssh arunk@192.168.1.255" 
returns "host not reachable"  IMO, this establishes that .0 and .255 
are reserved numbers i.e. not to be assigned to any host.

system A: ip no. 192.168.1.68 (the original ip no. restored)

system B: ping -c5 192.168.1.68 works!
          ssh arunk@192.168.1.68  works! I can login into my .68 
machine!

If you have > 1 physical machine in your network you can do the above 
and see for yourself.

Hope the above answers your question.

If this is the case then this is some new kind DOS attack targetted at
linux machines by infecting windows machine :-) !! More plausibily,
when linux encounters an address conflict it shuts up but when you are
on windows it ignores the conflict and is chatty as usual!

Really, I think you should change ISP!

Congrats.

Interestingly with a distributed model, the notion of commit access may 
not be that important at all. Nobody commits directly to the Linus git 
repository of the kernel except himself yet we have that model scaling 
incredibly well. Just a side note.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

find -- Search for files in a directory hierarchy

Summary:

Find is useful to search in the deeply nested collection folder. It
can execute some actions on the files, which found by it and it
provides lot of useful options for file searching.

Example:

$ find -- List all files in current and its sub Dir.

$ find / -name resolv.conf -- Find the resolv.conf

$ find /etc -name '*conf*' -- Find all conf file /etc Dir.

$ find ~/ -size 1000c -- Find files that have a size equal to 1KB.

$ find ~/ -size +1500c -- Find files that have a size > 1KB.

$ find ~/ -size -1500c -- Find files that have a size < 1KB.

$ find ~/ -empty -- Find empty files and directories.

$ find ~/ -amin -5 -- Find files accessed in last 5 minutes.

$ find ~/ -atime -1 -- Find files accessed in last 24 hours.

$ find ~/ -mmin -5 -- Find files modified in last 5 minutes.

$ find ~/ -mtime -2 -- Find files modified in last 48 hours.

$ find ~/ -size +1kc -and -mtime 2 -- Find files (Size >1K & modified 
                                      time is 2 Days)

$ find ~/ -nouser -- Find files owned by an invalid user.

$ find ~/ -user user1 --  Find files owned by user1.

$ find ~/ -maxdepth 2 -name 'fi*' -- Search for files starting with 
          'fi' and don't go more 2 level down in the Dir structure.

$ find ~/ -name '*.conf' -ls -- Find the all .conf files and print the 
                                output in ls -l format.

$ find ~/ -name '*.txt' -exec cat {} \; -- Find all text files and cat
                                           the files.

$ find ~/ -name '*.txt' -printf %h\\n -- Find all text file and print
                                            the path of the each file.

NOTE:
1) In the examples, I used Home path for searching the file. You can 
   change it to any other path.
2) Read the man page, to know about other useful and advance options.

Read: man find

HTH :)

This line of reasoning is slightly bizarre.Getting your code into an
official release is not just a matter of cloning a repository and then
committing changes locally with a distributed version control system.
Regardless of the nature of the version control system there are
always gatekeepers who choose to accept or reject your changes. In the
case of subversion it's the committers and in the case of Linux it's
Linus' gatekeepers like Andrew Morton. I can clone the Linux git tree
and commit locally, but one of the kernel gatekeepers has to accept
it. Otherwise it's not going to get into the official Linux kernel.

What Senthil has achieved is not merely making code changes, but
getting them accepted through a review process. Congrats Senthil.

I think the distributed version control  guys have not been able to
articulate well their case well, and have been throwing out this "You
don't need commit access with DVCS" marketing bit. There actually
might be a few scenarios for which the DVCS approach is suited (like
the Linux kernel), but those have not been explained well so far
AFAIK.

I need an anti-virus program on Linux. I have a Debian Etch Linux computer
at home. My mother transfers data with Windows computers. The purpose is to
ensure that viruses don't get transferred via the Linux computer. Kindly
advise.

Distributed version systems work well for a multiple of reasons.
I don't need constant network connectivity. I can hack away on a local tree and send
a pull request when I am done. Branch creation is local and not remote, which makes it
almost instantaneous, merging becomes a really trivial affair.
I have the entire history locally, so tracing/bisecting a bad commit is possible.

Yes, you are right that there a few final gatekeepers who manage the releases, but
it encourages a model where your code will be reviewed by many people before
finally being accepted. And code review is surely a good thing. :)

Sorry I saw this mail only now.

This is a rule. Actually it is an accident.

We are losing  one extra IP for every subnet.

This is due to historical reasons. I wonder it is due to the conflict
between having all 0s or all 1s for the host part of the IP address.

I guess this was to make things easier for hardware level xor operations
or something.

1 EXOR 1 = 0

0 EXOR 0 = 0

1 EXOR 0 = 1

0 EXOR 1 = 1

So if you have an EXOR gate in your router/switch, then all 1s and all
0s both lend to fast processing.

Anyway one should read the history to figure out exactly what happened.

One Day One GNU/Linux Command
=============================

hostid - Print the numeric id for the host.

Summary:

It will print a 32-bit hexadecimal numerical identifier for the host
machine. Certain product registration procedures use this number to
brand a particular user license. The 32-bit quantity happens to be
closely related to the system's IP address, but that isn't always the
case.

If your IP address is 192.168.14.155 then your hostid is A8C09B0E.

A8 -- 168
C0 -- 192
9B -- 155
0E -- 14

Example:

$ hostid -- Print the hostid of the current host.

Read: man hostid

IMO, we loose 2 IP numbers for every subnet.  One for the Network ID 
(host bits all 0s) and one for the Broadcast ID (host bit all 1s).

Pls. read the results of my experiment posted to this thread earlier.  
0s and 1s are reserved for special purpose and routing tables go by it.

Agreee,  perhaps networking gurus here who could enlighten us?

are planning to come to this meeting, Plz present at least by 9:45AM.
We will try to discuss with-in ourself.

Plz go thru the Draft before coming to this meet.

It can and Subversion developers themselves are big on review and 
enforce it consistently via cultural means (Refer 
http://producingoss.com/) but I would argue that the nature of the 
system doesn't by itself encourage it.  It would really depend on the 
workflow. If you are using one of the DVCS's, almost any non-trivial 
work can go into a alternative branch and commits be done offline. Merge 
back is easy and fast. It can be viewed coherently as a whole instead of 
in terms of files which is important IMO for review.

Oh, it can certainly happen if you enforce policies.
With DVCS, it is just part of the workflow.

And I can understand where a centralized repo would make perfect sense.
I use both Perforce and git on a daily basis and both have their merits.

Perhaps people are mis-understanding each other here.

Getting commit-access to a non-D VCS is rather like getting the status
of Debian Maintainer. The latter can be seen as "commit-access" to a
portion of the Debian repository.

So this _is_ a social norm being achieved by Senthil:

 Someone or some group whom we respect has examined a candidate
 and has declared the candidate "passed".

In such a case, IMHO the candidate deserves our plaudits.

The merit of implementing this social norm using a technical
barrier is of course debatable.

Regards,

Kapil.

Subject: [Ilugc] apache directory browsing for authenticated users
Message-ID: <92f9a9560808271543t25564632y4f5c195bc1d6f7cd@mail.gmail.com>

I'm running an Apache 2.0.16 server on Debian.

By default I've disabled directory browsing (Option Indexes)
on my server.  But now I want to permit directory browsing
only for authenticated users.

I've tried various combinations of Directory/DirectoryMatch
from the man pages, but nothing seems to work.

Has anyone implemented this sucessfully and have a config
file they can share?

Thanks!

Dear All,

Please help me in setting up of master and slave in NIS configuration. Also I would like to know whether when I create a slave server,
all the users available in the master server will be automatically replicate to the slave servers.

For eg. In Windows all the users available in the PDC will be replicated to  ADC & Child domain.

Please clarify my doubts on this regard.

What exact problems are you encountering in your NIS setup?

I would suggest a LDAP based solutions rather than NIS.  It is more 
versatile.

I have not tried it but you can try giving specific apache directives in 
the .htaccess file itself (make sure overrides is enabled in the 
main .conf).

Let us know if this works.

hi,

I have a moinmoin wiki with the following config:

  acl_rights_before =  
u"RaianIrani,golfer:read,write,delete,revert,admin"

the user 'golfer' can delete pages. For the user RaianIrani, delete  
option is shown, but he gets the message 'you do not have permission

hi,

the workshop was a huge success, full reports here:

  http://nrcfosshelpline.in/web/full/56/NW/

There are IT associations in all towns of the state. I feel that all  
of them are very eager to know about FOSS as there is good demand for  
that now since government has deployed linux machines on a large  
scale. Also cybercafe operators are fed up with windows. We must try  
to have workshops in more places. If LUG members can contact the  
associations, they will be happy to have workshops along with NRC- 
FOSS, as they all have good respect for Anna University.

Hi,
I am facing a really devastating problem here in one of our server. It is
running Fedora 7; it`s running dspace. Suddenly from last night, no command
is working there in gnome. Today morning, when i tried to enter graphically,
i couldn`t do that, shows... "gnome-session will close in 10 seconds...
blah..blah ..blah"

I can login as root remotely, but no command is working there... as for
example: ls, yum,su or so on.

Now, i cannot remove that fedora anymore, cause, we have a lot of important
data in root ( / ) partition.

What can i do now? Please help me. Here, i am adding a little bit part of my
commands:

Last login: Thu Aug 28 12:41:51 2008
[root@localhost ~]# ls
-bash: ls: command not found

Now the cyber cafe folks will have to spend time teaching their customers Linux :-) Moreover a lot of folks will simply walk away when they see a linux OS when they are expecting to see a Win OS. doesn't sound like a pretty business model.

Is this server on the 'Net?  Are you 100% sure that nothing is wrong 
with the hardware, especially the hard disk?

What kind of applications are you running on the system?  Are these 
apps. available to the target users?

> It is running Fedora 7; it`s running dspace. Suddenly from last

On production systems, use an enterprise grade distro like CentOS 
(equiv. RHEL) if you are unwilling to go with commercial RHEL or 
Novell/SUSE.

The symptoms suggest that your machine has been cracked open.

Did you install the entire system on one partition?  Where does your 
important data reside on the file system tree e.g. /var/lib/mysql?

LiveCD.  It has a lot of security tools that might throw some light on 
what happened.

In future, use an enterprise grade distro and plan your partition size 
i.e. tell the distro installer what partitions to use for the various 
sub trees of the file system.

To avoid further oops/trial and error I suggest you seek experienced 
professional help.

Is it possible to copy all the data from /usr/src/ to flash-drive with
live/Rescue CD?

Uh, I know we are deviating from the topic, but why would that be 
debatable? DVCS aren't made just for making gatekeeping easier; they are 
made so that maintaining distributed code bases easier. Especially for 
open source projects, this makes a lot of sense.

If you look at GitHub, they take it to a whole new level - where 
'forking' a project is not much of an issue - it's completely acceptable 
- you just fork it into your account, work on the branch and commit it 
to your own repo, and ask the main project maintainer to 'pull' whenever 
your changes are ready to be integrated into the main project. In this 
way, you don't have to offend anybody that you forked a project, or 
worry that you have so much uncommitted changes lying around, and not 
bother the original project maintainer until your changes are fully 
tested and ready.

Maybe your PATH variable is messed up, have you tried giving full path
of the command? eg. /bin/ls
This is in addition to advice given by others above.

Social norms are different from technical barriers. Traditionally it has 
been tied together because systems like CVS and others that mimic it 
haven't offered a better model. Refer to the earlier links I have given 
to understand this better.

I think so. I have tried with the full path, eg. /bin/ls  .. it works. Now,
though my PATH variable is completely messed up, so, can i recover this in
any way? I don`t want to reinstall the os again.

I still don't get it. Why is being distributed a 'technical barrier'  
for anything? The point is, being distributed is an enabler. The result 
of less gate-keeping is an outcome of that. This is completely natural. 
Better systems make things which were chores earlier a bit easier. 
What's there to be debated here?

One thing you can do is the following.

Get "sash" (standalone shell) or "busybox" (another standalone
program) on your local machine. These programs are standalone
and do not depend on any libraries etc.

Use scp to push it to the remote machine like
	scp /path/to/busybox remote:/root/busybox

Now you can login to the remote machine and run busybox
	ssh remote /root/busybox

You should then be able to use the built-in commands in busybox to
diagnose the problem.

Kapil.

You are misreading the mail. I never claimed distributed was a technical

Subject: [Ilugc] Draft Patent Manual Meeting
Message-ID: <loom.20080828T111714-209@post.gmane.org>

About 8 ILUGC members attended the meeting. There were 2 from FSUG Bangalore. At
the start of the meeting we were told that issues related to software patents
will be discussed in a separate meeting! The meeting date was not announced. We
were asked check the website.

But we did get a clarity on what this Manual was all about. It was clearly
stated that the document did not have any legal binding. It was just a handbook
for patent examiners and people who would like to apply for patents. The
handbook just happens to contain the interpretation of the law. (And has a wrong
interpretation of course.) Anyways we will have to get this fixed, to avoid
unnecessary litigations.

The contents of the manual itself was questioned during the meeting. Some
suggested that the manual should only contain procedures of patent application,
rather than such detailed interpretations of the patent law. It was also
discussed that the manual will be rewritten completely, possibly removing
elaborate interpretations of the patent law, scaling it down to 100 pages or so.

Vijay

Okk.. thank you all for your help. At last i solved it in a very different
way.

I just put :  *# export PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin*

and everything is back again.

... and the need for a manual in the first place. Also, the
step-by-step issues, at every step, that an individual faces in filing
a patent application at the patent office was openly shared for people
to know.

I didn't have time to put the following in a CD and distribute at the meeting:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/TheDangerOfSWPatent1of2.ogg
http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/TheDangerOfSWPatent2of2.ogg
http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/rms.danger.of.software.patents.pdf

But, anyone who will be attending the proposed meeting on 'software
patent issue', is welcome to use the above. If there is any artist
here who can make a nice CD label for the above, print it, and use it
on the above CDs, it will be helpful.

Thanks,

SK

I attended the Mumbai meeting.  Also pls. see Dr. Nagarjuna's notes that 
I forwarded to this list.

There were a lot of reps (incl. legal) from the pharma, biotech 
industries, more than the software guys.  In my opinion they said a lot 
more collectively than the software guys.  It was in the Mumbai meet 
the chair declared that there would be a separate stake holder meeting 
on "software" @ Bengaluru and likewise a for the pharma/biotech 
industries to be announced.

True, there were differing views put forth on "Software Patents" but to 
say the Mumbai meeting was skewed with discussion on 'software patents' 
is a stretch.

Message-ID: <cbaa36330808281953h59fde8fx6f3c4c5b0b7b641c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Lugies,

I have a 160 GB Sata Hard disk in which I had installed ubuntu and win xp
with grub in the MBR.

 Somehow the grub got corrupt and I removed the windows and installed
mandriva with grub .

But grub was not able to identify the ubuntu installation (I am not able to
find the Ubuntu /boot partition )and hence i started installing ubuntu
again.But during ubuntu installation from a live cd the partition tool shows
the entire hard disk as a single partition and forces me to format the whole
disk.

I have tried creating fresh partitions using fdisk but that doesnt shw up in
the partition tool which comes with ubuntu.

fdisk was warning me that my cylinders no.s in harddisk is more than 1024
,hence some partition tools may have problem with reading the partition
table. gparted too shows the entire hard disk as a single partition.

I have 100 GB of important data in my hard disk and suggest me a way to
install back my ubuntu darling without loosing any of them.

are you sharing root password with others?. Did you check the ip address
in that log? from where that person logged? is that ip address belongs
to your network?

Was it an unauthorised access? If so, it's better not to trust that
install anymore.

Are you sure? Isn't this the default checked option with other options also
made available, below?

There will be a provision to extract free space from an existing partition
and there will also be a Manual option.

Can you some how manage to get the screen shot at this point?

Message-ID: <c9ea6e770808282348l5ddde712jfdb4c23045428034@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was going through Mono and Mono develop few days back.  It was said, that
mono is a .NET port for linux, spearheaded by Novell.

Can Mono be an efficient tool for commercial projects?  If its so, why its
not widely adopted?

There is a good IDE similar to Visual Studio, and it would provide a good
dev platform for application projects.

Is there any review of Mono to know more about its viability?

regards,
Senthil

As per the mono website, (http://www.mono-project.com/Software), two
applications developed in it caught my attention

-> http://www.splendidcrm.com/  (a port of sugar crm)
-> Deki Wiki

I feel, if Mono is really feasible, we can establish it for RAD for some
realtime business applications..

also look at dotgnu - I think it is closer to dotnet as it uses C#

I just googled for comparing dotgnu and mono..  the following articles are
interesting

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/02/11/mono_and_dotgnu_whats/

http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3361991

It seems, only Microsoft is going to get benefitted by either Mono or
DotGNU..

But clearly, Mono is in an advantageous position..

A lot of commercial applications has been developed using Mono..
particularly the dekiwiki from mindtouch.com looks promising..

Any alternate views?  particularly on whether microsoft will get benefitted
out of .NET port to linux?

i dont think that is right, since most cybercafe's around the world use 
embedded / locked down systems[1] with access only to a web browser and 
_some_ support tools along with it - most people need a familiar'ish

If you are paying for RHEL5 then go for it ..else dont . If you look
for an enterprise like solution go for CentOS or if you will be using
the computer as a home PC go for Fedora . People may suggest many more
distro's .take a good look and settle on what you need .

In order to dual boot with Windows ..install WinXP first as you  do
normally . Leave a 25 GB partion (what you call in windows) ,I 'd
suggest a freespace of 25 gig . While installing linux use that 25 gig
of space .

Now do whatever you want to do with Windows .
and use linux .

i wont suggest oracle 9i in windows over virtual machine though you
can do that .But you can access windows partions and file from linux
too . and have oracle 9i in your windows partition .

But however its ultimately your choice .

Oops ! i did a blunder ..

Soory Manoj , dont go by fixed amount of space but divide your HD in
70% - 30% where 70% goes to linux (since it will be your primary OS )
and 30 % elsewhere (as you need oracle there ) .But again its no hard
and fast rule .

yes, i do get your point. it is the case if you  are browsing from an airport or a bus/train terminal with internet access. all you get is to see the browser and it doesn't even matter what the OS is. but there isn't much choice when you are in transit.

   I have seen even regular cafe's do that. they try to lock up almost everything. The only difference is that i found it choking and stopped visiting them. I probably need more than a browser. i might need to download and read a ms word doc or ppt or an excel sheet that a friend has send in. lets say that i am a novice and i have no clue to use open office. It would be annoying and would be easier to find some place where i can use the tools i am familiar with.

   I think people go to a cyber cafe for more than browsing. when you  dependent on MS office to get your work done and download microsoft supported formats, it is best to have a windows machine unless the cafe owners want to loose (some) customers.

    Any way, with OLPC like (cheaper) laptops hitting the market and low internet costs, people would be free to choose what they want to use.

i dont think that is right, since most cybercafe's around the world use
embedded / locked down systems[1] with access only to a web browser and
_some_ support tools along with it - most people need a familiar'ish
interface and a web browser is that.

Subject: [Ilugc] Perl and C programming workshop
Message-ID: <20080829164703.GA25550@gayatri.gayatri-hitech.com>

Dear friends,

As part of our initiative to spread the light of knowledge,
Bharathi and I have come up with a two day workshop on 
C and perl programming. First day will be all perl and 
second day will be all C.

This is going to be less stressful than the TCP/IP seminar 
since there is not much to memorize and learn. Only the 
experience of programming and solving problems.

There are certain important idioms to be learnt in coding that
comes only by a very long programming experience. We will try 
to generally get together, have fun and learn.

The idea of this workshop is fund raising. As always this is also
totally free of any financial gain. But at the same time you will 
be required to pay Rs.1000/- for the two day workshop. In case 
you miss the first day, you have to pay Rs.1000/- for the second 
day alone.

We wish to express heartfelt thanks to our previous sponsors Prof. Ashok
Jhunjhunwala of TENET fame and also Sundarraman of Exeter Premedia 
Pvt Ltd.

We expect fresh sponsors for this event. We are looking at a seating 
capacity of close to 150. If individual computers are made available
 it will be great but this is not a must. People can also bring their 
laptops to ease the load of the sponsors.

The idea is to funnel the funds collected in this event with the 
existing funds from the TCP/IP seminar and utilize this money for 
augmenting the hardware resources of LUG. Depending on the money 
collected we can come up with a proper way to utilize them.

Once the details are finalized Bharathi will get back to you.

It looks quite clear that this event will be on a weekend in October.

More later.

The second day of intense C sounds fun. Is there any chance of decreasing
the fee amount for the student community?
(Unfortunately 1000/- is a steep amount for us :( )

I do get manual option but it shows as if the entire hard disk is free.

Can you some how manage to get the screen shot at this point?


Apologies will send you the screen shot tomorrow evening since I am away
from my system.

I once came across similar problem where 320 GB was at stake, I installed Testdisk and it restored the partition table and thus saved my data.

Install Ubuntu on available space without touching the partition where rest of the data lies, then install testdisk and follow simple instructions...

You may give it a try.

But, be careful...

I don't think you to type 100's of commands to do your work in
Openoffice. How can one not have clue on using openoffice? Maybe it
may seem unfamiliar for moment or two but anyone familiar with MS
Office can definitely get working with Openoffice for basic functions
in no time. And I am saying this from my experience.

What does it matter? OpenOffice can open and save in MS Office formats
except for OOXML.

It is possible to use OpenOffice for most MS Office type jobs without
the customer feeling any significant difference in use.

Additionally, there is always Google Docs.

In my (limited) experience, the requirements of most users of
"cyber-cafe" installations are met adequately by GNU/Linux. However,
one needs to ensure that the sysadmin of the cyber-cafe is:
 a. sufficiently familiar with use of the tools that the customer
 is going to use. (Firefox, OpenOffice, ...) Most users are going
 to turn to her/him for help in any case!
 b. can update/install the system if/when required.
This is precisely what the workshop addressed.

There will *always* be users whose specialised needs will not be met
by cyber-cafes --- even when these cafes run Windows! For example,
are you sure that a file created on one version of MS Office will
work with another version of the same program?

Finally, if you keep on insisting that the "general customer's
needs" can only be met by installing Windows, then (according to
you) those who are putting in a lot of effort to replace Windows by
GNU/Linux on the desktop should probably pack up their bags and go
somewhere else!

Regards,

Kapil.

There is a parameter MINUID and MINGID in /var/yp/Makefile. This determines
who are part of the NIS. All users having uid above MINUID will be in NIS. Users below MINUID will be local. Normally root,adm etc will not be in NIS. It is not advisable to have root as part of NIS.

  I am hearing about testdisk for the first time.Thanks for it .Will try it.
But I would like to understand why this problem exists. fdisk throwed a
error message stating that "the number of cylinders is more than 1024 hence
you may have problems ". If any one has worked with grub/gparted give your
thoughts over it.

that is precisely what he is  suggesting. What he forgets is that  
*we* did not go and ask the cybercafe guys to switch to linux -  
*they* asked us to tell them how and why. They did this because the  
amount of maintainence needed for windows is a huge burden, there is  
the ever present fear of raids and legal software is too expensive  
for the smaller people. Their main concern was on the server end -  
most of them  would like to use linux on the server end, even if they  
have windows desktops.

Another thing he has forgotten is that 98% of windows users have  
never heard of linux and have never had a chance to see it in action.  
So why he is objecting to cyber cafe owners giving their customers a  
taste of linux I cannot understand. All of us once used windows, but  
when we got a taste of linux we switched.

I have been keenly watching the tea shop that has sprung up just  
outside the gate at MIT. He started selling only tea and coffee. I  
switched my business to him because his USP was that he opened at 5  
am whereas the guy opposite used to open at 6. Strangely enough,  
every customer who came to his shop *only* asked for either tea or  
coffee. No one asked for pakoda or bun or vadai. One day I found a  
pile of pakoda available. If he had followed the logic of the OP, he  
would have said: 'all my customers are only asking for tea and  
coffee, if I sell pakoda, no one will buy and I will lose customers'.  
But he did not do that. Now he has vadai, bun, cigarettes, beedi,  
sweets, pan ... and is flourishing.

This is how businesses grow - avoid monoculture, diversify. Offer  
more products. This is the logic behind supermarkets too. Offer  
variety and you will grow. I do not think that any cybercafe will rip  
out all the windows machines and replace them with linux. They will  
probably try out linux on a few and see what happens. I remember back  
in 2005 I went to a cybercafe in Adyar who had 4 machines - two of  
them linux. His server was also linux.

So a cybercafe with linux servers are much more secure as they are  
safe from raids. And if they are raided they have an alternative  
ready to continue their business without paying the M$ tax.

Well it is only Rs.500/- per day. And the insistence on 1000/- for the
second day is to motivate people to attend both days.

Moreover this is mainly aimed at the developer community. Students are
not the main audience here. (They are very much welcome though)

Concessional rates for students does not sound like a very good idea to
me. 

I leave it to Bharathi or any other LUG member to express their views on
this.

I am totally open to any other inputs/comments.

If people feel that the rates are high then I don't have any problem in
reducing it at all. But I need more voices here.

Thanks.

Porting .NET to Linux will definitely help Microsoft.  Perhaps not
in direct Windows sales, but in the platform war against Java.

Microsoft is already heavily involved in adding .NET support for
Python, Ruby, etc.  Back in 2000 my university was funded by
Microsoft to port our Mercury programming language to .NET.

An increased .NET marketshare, will certainly benefit Microsoft.

Hi,

I have installed OpenSUSE 11.0 in a Vostro 1510 laptop (dual boot with
vista). It was not straight forward and had to use noapm, noapic and noacpi
to get the keyboard and touchpad working during the install itself. During
install I had a USB mouse connected to the system. Now, only if the USB
mouse is connected, the keyboard and touchpad are working in Linux! If I
remove the mouse and boot the system I can't even log on because the
keyboard and touchpad do not work. What could be the issue? Anobody else
with a Dell vostro?

With regards,
Arun Venkataswamy

bad news. Most people do not have a clue.

>>>Maybe it

Office can definitely get working with Openoffice for basic functions
in no time. And I am saying this from my experience.

We are trying to determine if its a good business model to use *nix in a cybercafe. If some one asks for Microsoft office at a cyber cafe, you cannot just ask them to try out open office.


>>>What does it matter? OpenOffice can open and save in MS Office formats
except for OOXML.

if everything that works on Microsft office works so seamlessly on open office, why do so many people buy Ms office. let us accept that Open office does not handle Microsoft Office formats very well, at least in its current form.

It is very similar to %d of printf. It will generate sequence of

Message-ID: <500120.44146.qm@web33108.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

We have 2 Dell Vostro 1510 (bought a few weeks back) running Ubuntu. Everything works out of the box except wifi for which I was too lazy to configure ndiswrapper.
I have configured wifi with ndiswrapper in quite a few machines and it works perfectly.

Based on your description "noapm, noapic and noacpi" it looks like you have an AMD64 processor. Intel does not need those options.
Try Ubuntu (either live or install) - it should support all hardware without trouble (except wifi). I shifted from Suse to Ubuntu. Suse seems a lot slower on the same hardware.
I was born & brought up on fedora but fedora needs more tinkering to get it working correctly on laptops especially wifi and multimedia. Tried Suse for a few months. Seemed *very* sluggish. Ubuntu's restricted drivers makes it really easy for laptops/desktops.

Read up on printf(3) formats.

%03d indicates that instead of writing thumbnail1.png it will 
write thumbnail001.png.

I have had a similar experience at a cybercafe in Howrah, WB (circa 
2005).  The place was 100% RH9 desktop.  I was quite surprised and 
watched the other surfers in the cafe using the desktops.  None of them 
seemed to have a problem navigating the desktop or the apps :)

Dear Friends,

The Debian Live team is pleased to announce the first beta of Debian Lenny's Live images.

Although we missed releasing images for Etch along with the installer images, we are now prepared to release live images within the regular Lenny release process. This is the first official release of Debian Live and the whole team has been working hard during the past 2.5 years to make Debian's own live systems become a reality.

Nevertheless, we do need your help to find more bugs and improve the live systems, so please try them out. The images are available at:

That's great but you are hijacking threads to do the announcement in 
various lists which is not so great. Instead of replying to a existing

Kenneth ji,

How can I enable grammar check in OOo? I have not touched any MS thing for a long time, but I do miss the grammar check of MS Word. Could you please suggest something?

You can also use Abiword if your needs are simple.

Not any more than freaking out when they realize that they have to
struggle with the blue screens of death for a long time. Or over
inquisitiveness of the OS in the case of Windows Vista (so I hear).

I know of many totally non-geek Windows users who have made a partial
to near complete switch to Ubuntu for one simple reason: get work done
(where work is among word processing, spreadsheet, internet and
e-mail) minus blue screens of death. The fact that graphics and sound
works flawlessly in most GNU/Linux distributions adds to the reason.

I do not use Oo - I use kword, and have never used grammar check.  
Goog seems to suggest that there isnt one built in, but this link  
seems interesting:

Hi all,
 As one of the faculty (although participant should have been the better
label but whatever) was there for the FOSS workshop. Have blogged about it
at

http://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/2008/08/30/the-ooty-workshop/

 I don't think we spoke about LTSP as a solution for cyber-cafes, if one of
the other guys say Bharati, Ravi or Kenneth spoke about it in Telegu/Tamil
then don't know.

Overall, a very rewarding experience.

Not to mention few from Infosys, Microsoft, Qualcomm ;-)

The chair expressed that they have realized the concerns raised at Mumbai &
New Delhi meetings and hence have decided to hold a seperate meeting on
Software patents.

> But we did get a clarity on what this Manual was all about.

For those in group who haven't, concerned were expressed over provisions
made in the draft for patents for "Software combined with Hardware".

Expecting at least a minimum of two months before the next meeting would
come up.

You can also try gparted from the live cd. That has GUI which should
facilitate its usage.

if it is Ok from gparted (all partitions displayed properly there) and the
problem is in ubiquity alone (the ubuntu installer), then please file bug at
launchpad.net

Even gparted is showing it as a single partition only.

I have currently created a new partition using gparted just enough to
install ubuntu and left the remaining intact. I am not sure whether I will
be able to recover the old data in the disk.

One would think so. However there are innumerous reports of users using 
Openoffice.org to recover word files when MS Office could not. Here is one:

It's the X-Server that is crashing and that makes it an Ubuntu problem.
Let's keep this on the list.

Message-ID: <ed2d3c000808310006u7bf94968l5431fa5793093bdd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi friends,

We put up stalls for the festival Insyder-2008. The festival focussed
on building intelligent systems for rural development.
Our team comprised of Mr.Raman, Mr.Bhaskar, Mr.T.Shrinivasan , Mr.
Ramadoss and myself. We had  about 4 rounds of preparatory  sessions
with the students prior to the event  and our team travelled from
chennai to thiruvanamalai. Though the event is not about talking the
latest trends of IT developments, but  to focus how to build
intelligent systems for rural development.

We showcased 10 stalls,

1) LTSP future for tommorrow
2) Agriculuture Information system
3) Vetinary  and Information system
4) Women self help group knowledge management site
5) Educational softwares (2 stalls)
6) Rural industries information system
7) E- Medicine
8) Makkal thodrapu maiyam (Public sms addressing system)
9) Village geo info matics.

Traditional to the way of ilugc custom of conducting the LDD, we put
the students in front to build the system, make them understand the
nuances of the system , implement them (right from data collection)
and present them in front of the public.
Our team effort pulled a great satisfaction of work when seeing the
students in business.
Our LTSP stall had a good attention of the visitor, while the
education software stalls was packed with the visitors especially
young school students playing games, gcompris and watching
movies(bunny) which are made with blender.
All our stalls were powered with Linux operating systems.Stall no
2,3,4,6 are powered by Joomla 1.5 CMS and the contents are punched
with Tamil unicode. Stall no 8 powered with Gnokii engine, notably the
guy who led that team is from kamban engineering college showed his
dedication to work, by making the exhibit possible by build it,
debugging and fixing issues with respect to sandwiching the java swing
code with gnokii c code. Stall no 9 is all about taking stocks of
important places in a village like schools, primary health care
centre, police station, eb office, telephone office, vao house
plotted in the Google map. IMO  the data collection of geo coding and
collection of gpx file and plotting the data in the map may be a good
start to the students to persuade their careers in geo infomatics.

The function was inaugurated on 28 th aug 2008 by  Dr.Rajagopal
Secretary  Gandhigram trust,  showed interest in visiting each stall
and understanding the exhibit , appreciating and  advising  the
students. The second day of occasion is marked with the presence of
our union IT minister Mr.A Raja, who visited the stalls. The third day
the event concluded.

Overall, Our team enjoyed, we had  good experience.

Thanks and regards,

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Good work. Plz share your experiences in the next LUG meet. The SAD
part is still the old (OLD) team is handling this tasks. I don't see
any new young faces taking part in this kind of activities.

That was rude.  Not par for the course, KG.

Sarad. Just ignore it and ask and state all you want :-)

As for MS office opening all MS office document formats, till last
year MS excel files saved in (I think) xlsp format were not openable
in just the prior version of MS office! This caused a lot of trouble
in my last employer where a few had the latest Office on Vista and
others did not.

System setup: D945GCLF mobo, 2GB RAM, 80GB Seagate Barracuda SATA I hdd, 
onboard graphics, NIC, and audio.

0. Don't bother buying external case for CD/DVD drives.  Could not get 
to boot any LiveCD distro.  At first I thought the DVDROM was defective.  
Got rid of the external case, connected the CD/DVD to directly to the 
PATA port - install CDs/DVDs booted.

1. I was able to install Ubuntu 8.04.1 and openSUSE 11.0.  All devices 
(NIC, Sound, SATA, PATA) work for above distros.  The atom 230 CPU is 
dual core @ 1.6GHZ with 512K L2 cache for each core.

2. The system boots in about 60 secs from power up to GDM login screen.

3. Using Gnome/Compiz desktop the performance is acceptable.  OO writer 
loads up in < 10 secs the first time it is invoked.

Quirks:

1. CentOS 5.2 LiveCD - did not boot.  I get a kernel panic.  Will report 
to the CentOS team.

2. Embedded NIC RTL8169 shows a huge number of dropped packets (in 
Ubuntu and openSUSE).  Not sure what the problem is.  I have reported 
it to Intel tech support.

Overall, performance is acceptable for an average desktop usage - OO, 
FF, email etc.
