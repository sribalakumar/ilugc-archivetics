Dear All,

Willow Garage provides interns with an opportunity to integrate aspects of
their degree program with the real world application of open source software
development.

http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/software/opencv

Interested people with C++ and Geometric vision ( is an important and
well-studied part of computer vision) find the below information.

Thanks & Rg

As I mentioned in my new years message.


We (Willow Garage http://www.willowgarage.com a robotics
institute/incubator) can use an intern in 3D model capture.

That is: using silhouettes to capture an object and combine that with
structure from motion and stereo clues to create 3D object meshes out of
objects. Pay is good, free food, great location, work with robots, sensors
-- you can best summarize Willow as: Fun. Papers will be written, hard work
but good times, see examples at
http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/community/interns-and-visiting-scholars .

Who:
US, or US work visa is easiest. For more exceptional people who can stay
longer than 3 months, we'll deal with helping obtain a work visa. This is an
internship which means you are enrolled in some school. We might also
consider doing this with a consulting arrangement for non-students, but at
Intern rates. For real exceptional situations, work in place may be possible
and/or student grants to fund work in place.

Timing:
Winter, Spring, Fall. Summer is very full here already with interns.
Exception: Come in Spring and stay through the Summer.

Requirements:
MUST:
You must be a seasoned programmer in C++. There is no time for learning
curves, we work with robots and fairly complex systems.
You must have a good understanding of geometric vision. Calibration,
homography, structure from motion.
PLUS:
Computer graphics a big plus
Experience in optimization, CUDA etc also a plus.
Experience working with robots is a plus.

If you meet the "MUST" above, send application to
jobs@willowgarage.com<jobs%40willowgarage.com>Put in the title:
"Intern: 3D Model Capture"

generally files under /var/www/ (your document root) are owned by root. Hence 
you cannot save them. This is a good thing. Putting any files under document 
root is a bad thing - it exposes them to easy access by spammers. Set up a 
virtual host pointing to a directory in your home directory owned by you, then 
you can edit and save files as you please - and your system will be safer.

ps. put a proper subject line.

The good option is to keep /var/www/ permissions and ownership intact,
just *don't* mess  with it and to create a new directory inside it,
say

sudo mkdir /var/www/my_site/

then change owership of my_site.

sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/www/my_site/

now store your files in /var/www/my_site/ and access them using
http://localhost/my_site/

Hope That Helps.

That or just enable the public_html access in your apache2 config
file. http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/public_html.html explains
it. I am not sure if ubuntu ships with mod_userdir though.

Just a guess,  VLC probablt uses some non-free libraries.
Check the section -> Is libdvdcss legal?

Message-ID: <467c0a9a1001011030u1cc1edbds3511c1a74aeb00e8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need to play audio into a Bluetooth headset (through a SCO link). My Dell
Vostro's inbuilt Bluetooth adapter works brilliantly for the above job
running Ubuntu. In the final deployment, the system needs to work from a
desktop computer with an USB Bluetooth dongle.

I tried 2 dongles from the market, unknown Chinese ones. Both
are recognized and all Bluetooth functionality works except for audio
playback through a SCO channel. The market is mostly flooded  with these
unknown brands.

Anybody's got pointers on a BlueZ compatible brand and model (including SCO
support) available in Chennai?


Regards,
Arun

It brings great pleasure to see people working for Tamil.

I am afraid I cannot assume what is not said. The [commercial] tag is for 
foss/oss related commercial stuff - if it was for oracle on linux/bsd platform 
- even then I have my doubts. In all these cases, one must ask: 'what if every 
one does it?' The answer is: 'this list will be flooded with job posts for 
expertise in non-free tools'. Do we want this?

install poedit. choose the app you want to translate. There will be a .pot 
file. load this. Save it as appname.po. Choose edit-preferences-translation 
memory. Choose your language and ask it to generate a database. Point it to 
the available tamil files (usually in /usr/share or /usr/local/share). There 
will be about 200 such files in an average distro. Once your database is 
generated, ask it to automatically translate (this is under 'catalogue'). You 
will get a screen with 3 types of string - untranslated, translated and fuzzy. 
Fuzzy means that the computer is not sure whether it is a correct translation. 
Click on a string - you will get 2 windows, one showing the source string and 
the other showing the tamil (may be blank or may be a wrong translation). 
Translate the string and move on. Go through the fuzzy strings, correct the 
mistakes and mark them as non fuzzy. It is hard work at the beginning, but as 
your database grows, more and more automatic translations will be correct. 
When you save, the poedit will generate two files - appname.po and appname.mo. 
The second is a compiled version - and usually will give errors. Do not worry 
about that - the app developer should be able to take care of that.

I am not working for Tamil (I also do Kannada, and am not working for 
Kannada). I do it to improve my language skills and because it is fun. (I also 
do it because I am not happy with the current so-called translations into 
Tamil). And also to show that it is possible to contribute to a foss project 
even if you do not know how to code.

True. Need more co-ordinated efforts & more contributors.

We plan usability testing of translations at least once in a month,
after the FUEL event.

Dr. T Vasudevan has been translating GNOME & maintaining it
continuously.

Quality of it need to be reviewed & reported. You can start there. What
we do, need to be in usable form for the audience. You can take up GNOME
documentation work that is untouched. Join the GNOME list & ask Dr. TV.
He will be sending you PO files. You can yourself checkout.

You can join GNOME translation team & contribute, with Dr TV & Felix.

If you interested in KDE, I will be re-doing the Core of it this month &
all of the rest need to be done again. 

For XFCE, Mohan has started contributing, you can approach him

Firefox & Openoffice Mugunth is the contact person. An extract of
monthly reminder at Ubuntu L10n Team.

Hi.
My observations.

1. msgid "Enter a valid number within range"
    msgstr "?????????????? ??????????? ????? ???????????"

Enter does not mean ?????? here

2. msgid "Incomplete opcode"
  msgstr "?????? ???????? ????????"
  ?????? means address not opcode.You need something else for opcode.

3. msgid "Enter a valid number within range"
   msgstr "?????????????? ??????????? ????? ???????????"

This is just pure crap.You need something else for range, not ??????????? !

Indic languages have lot of words to represent single meaning, I think 
'???????????????" will be more meaningful if you see it in context to the 
application.

You are asking to ban the person who shared his knowledge by posting 
'a-tip-a-day', is this what ilugc will offer to a contributor?

By looking into the personal attacks and useless conversations in this 
list, I don't think this is a good reason to ban a person,

May be his intension is different than what being interpreted here.

Thanks,

Application : VirtualBox-OSE

What it is:    VirtualBox is a free x86 virtualization solution
allowing a wide range
of x86 operating systems such as Windows, DOS, BSD or Linux to run on a
Linux system.

Install.deb file using the following command

sudo dpkg -i virtualbox_1.5.4-27034_Ubuntu_gutsy_i386.deb

At the time of installation if you have any dependency problems like
the following errors

I have been wandering in this list for about a year or so but when I
asked for a Centos 64 bit cd/DVD I got a loud silence.

So I am not very impressed with the patronising and "Greedom" (did I
misspell freedom there?) attitude.

above purely IMHO..

Yes can perform the streaming. But VLC cannot be the full fledged streaming server as its not matured enough.

This is a great trend.

The work should get done and it really doesn't matter how does it.

I may take time to get back on track. So you guys should be
able to help each other.

Please keep up the good work!

May God bless!

Please share your experience/problems with vlc as a streaming server.  
What alternative streaming server have you found (FOSS or non-FOSS) that 
is mature (i.e. ready for production deployment)?

You can use 'alien' to convert .rpm to .deb package and try with the
installation. See http://wiki.debian.org/Alien for more details.

An .rpm package is built to be used by RPM-based distributions. Ubuntu
uses a .deb format for its packages. Of course, there are tools that
can convert packages from one format to another, but, it is
recommended that you use your distro package manager (apt, or yum) to
install software.

You can install the "alien" package which will make the rpm packages
installable via dpkg, or you can install the "rpm" package, which will
enable you to install rpm packages directly without dpkg.

You may want to check that the package is not already available for
ubuntu. Use synaptic to search for the package. Or you could give
apt-cache search package to locate relevant package and do apt-get
install

rpm is a package file format supported by RedHat and RedHat-based
distros. It is not directly installable on Debian and Debian-based
distros like Ubuntu which use .deb package file format.

There is a tool called 'alien' which helps in converting .rpm packages
to .deb packages so that they can be installed in Debian-based distros,
but it isn't always guaranteed to work.

Some time back I've read thinkfinger http://thinkfinger.sourceforge.net/ is
a good option. I've never played with it, so I can't say how easy/hard it.

Is this an official ubuntu supported release ? What's the difference? I just
downloaded the Virtual box 3.0 deb from their site. Works well. What's the
difference bw that and virtual box ose ? And does ose stand for "Open source

But, don't misuse this to start flame wars or to troll
in the mailing list.

4. Do not top-post:

6. Do not post HTML messages

7. Do not recycle messages

8. Do not send attachments

9. Do not attach obnoxious, nonsensical legal
disclaimers. If your company uses disclaimers, don't
use your company ID for the mailing list.

10. Do not reply to a digest. (If you are in digest
mode and want to reply to a post use ILUGC Gmane blog
interface.

Link:
http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.org.user-groups.linux.ilugc

11. Search for answers for your questions/problems in
google.com or any other search engine before posting
your query to the mailing list.

If any of the above are not clear to you, Please read
the detailed list guidelines:

Link:
http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

12. Do not post messages in all capital letters. Mails
in CAPS is considered rude and is similar to shouting
during a conversation.

13. Following these guidelines could be helpful
http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/

14. Don't send season's greetings or birthday or social networking site
?invites to the group. Its not mailing list etiquette.

We must use the above guidelines to maintain better
readability, proper archives, efficient bandwidth
usage, etc.

When you ask a question of this nature, its always a good idea to 
express the issue ( which you did : not being able to install an rpm 
package on ubuntu ). And then also mention that it is that you tried and 
how did you fail. This is not something you did, and pretty much 
anything that anyone comes up with -  will either be unhelpful or just 
patronising. I'll assume the second and consider you as not knowing what 
you are doing. So here goes:

You should be able to 'apt-get install rpm' and then just use the rpm 
command to do the install etc ( get creatively interesting with deps ). 
An rpm file is just a cpio archieve so another option is to install 
rpm2cpio, extract the payload, and handle that whatever way you like. eg:
mkdir -p ~/tmp/myrpm; cd ~/tmp/myrpm/; rpm2cpio >pathto.rpm< | cpio -idv

And finally, there is an app called 'alien', which will conver your rpm 
into a deb file ( works fine for the very simple rpm's - if there is any 
level of inherited complexity, you need to handle that on your own ).

Just a couple of recommendations:

1) how about working with the basics of Linux rather than distro and 
niche specific stuff ? things like that are best handled in their own 
distro specific mailing lists. eg. one could easily run a 
month-of-coreutils commands for the CLI side of things and another month 
of  components-in-X.org for the GUI side.

2) put the name of the app, and just the name, in the subject line of 
the email that is posted.

3) Abbreviate the 'one-application-one-day' to something like OAOD ( 
after a few days, most people will know hat that means.

Just my bit, use / disregard as appropriate.

I personally like Celestia better than Stellarium. It's been long since I
used Stellarium. Hope they have improved things and several issues. I'll
have to try stellarium again to see if they have...

Celestia lets u go to several stars in the visible universe. They've
included details of almost all extraterrestrial objects. You can even get up
close and personal with some spacecraft. like ISS / Hubble / MIR etc. If you
go far off enough the solar system, you can even meet the long dead
Cassini.. ;-)

then, take whatever field you want like this,

$ du -s 1.txt | awk '{print $1;}'
100
$

or another one,

$ ls -l /bin/bash | awk '{print $5;}'
908464
$

Thanks,

Stellarium and Celestia are two very different applications. I use both.
Stellarium is more of a planetarium application and Celestia is a full
fledged space simulator. Both are brilliant in their own ways. Stellarium is
a great sky map application. Very practical to take with you to the terrace.

Oh. Didn't realize that. Sorry. I did a quick web search. Both are in the
top results. I also hit upon a lot of something called NightShade..  It's a
fork of Stellarium it seems.

It compiles OK, by I get a segmentation fault while trying to run the
compiled app.
I have not yet looked at the code.

Does the pop server auth require full email id or userid? Maybe the issue.
I'd recommend you try uid/pwd and then email id/pwd combo to localise the
problem. May then be configuration issue for virtual domain auth.

Hi,

I'm trying to add a custom field to the issue tracker in Redmine. I was able
to create text, boolean and time/date fields. But I also need to create a
URI field which has to be 'clickable'. I have been chasing my tail so far.
Please help.

Stellarium seems to be very good. But why nightshade ? What disadvantages of
Stellarium does it aim to overcome ? Any idea?

Stellarium is more focused for the desktop use. Though it has features of a
fish eye transformation which helps in projection into a planetarium dome
(through a spherical mirror), it does not concentrate on that feature.
Nightshade is primarily focusing on usage in planetariums (big and small).
Chennai's Birla planetarium is still using a mechanical star projector. They
do have a small secondary digital projector, but I don't know what software
they use.

I guess you should not write NULL for both username and password. Just leave
it blank

Username =

I have seen providing the phone number as both username and password in
some cases. But still, give it a try and see.

Note: I use reliance this way.

If you are using Ubuntu 9.04 or Ubuntu 9.10, then use Network-Manager to
configure internet connection. also for Fedora 11& 12.

Search for pessulus and sabayon. Here I am assuming you are using
GNOME because from your description it sounds to me that you are using

Use wine or something. Safari doesn't run natively on Linux.

Hi all,
        Now trying to install alsa audio driver into my Linux distro.
The problem is, when i run alsaconf in command line, it opens up a minimal
GUI kind interface, that requires the user input interactively.
Im planning to automate this process when my distro boots up, without
requiring any user interaction.
Any idea how to do this?

Message-ID: <34d63e2b1001050758p15fb3167u3295c1a31ca82b06@mail.gmail.com>

Application : XBMC

What it is:  XBMC Media Center (formerly named Xbox Media Center) is a
cross-platform free and open source media player and home
entertainment system software with a 10-foot user interface design for
the living-room TV. The graphical user interface framework allows the
user to easily manage video, photos, podcasts, and music from a
computer, optical disk, local network, and the internet using a remote
control.

XBMC Features:

    1. Audio/video playback and handling
    2. Format support
    3. Video playback in detail
          3.1 Video Library
    4 Audio playback in detail
         4.1 Music Library
    5 Digital picture/image display in detail
    6 Python scripts (widgets/gadgets) plugins
    7 Dashboard function (game/application launcher)
    8 Language support
    9 Skins and skinning-engine
         9.1 User Interface Screenshots from XBMC
    10 Xbox specific features and functions
         10.1 XBMC Trainer Support (game cheats mods)
         10.2 XLink Kai (Xbox Live online-gaming alternative)

Install XBMC:

 Installing XBMC Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic or higher

If you are using Ubuntu 9.10, you have the option of a more
streamlined install. Load the terminal window and issue the following
(The $ is a standard substitute for your terminal prompt):

     $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-xbmc
     $ sudo apt-get update
     $ sudo apt-get install xbmc
     $ sudo apt-get update



You do not need to add the XBMC Repo nor the PPA Keys. XBMC is already
installed.

Adding the XBMC Repo:

Adding the XBMC Repo tells your system where to look for xbmc for
installation and future updates

    * From the Desktop, click System -> Administration -> Software Sources.
    * Click the "Third Party Sofware" tab.
    * Click "Add" for each of the following. For the Apt line type the
following, substituting "jaunty" for your version:

    deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/team-xbmc/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main
    deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/team-xbmc/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main

    * Click "Close". If you see a GPG Error upon closing the window,
not to worry. That will be handled in the next step.

Adding PPA Keys

These packages are signed with a unique key for added security.
Synaptic needs to know this key in order to verify the packages'
authenticity.

    * Click here to view the PGP key
    * Select the text from the beginning of the keyblock to the end
(including those lines)
    * Copy that text to the clipboard (Edit -> Copy)
    * Open your text editor from Applications -> Text Editor.
    * Paste the key contents (Edit -> Paste)
    * Save the document in your home folder as xbmc-ppa.key
    * Reopen Software Sources, this time choosing the "Authentication" tab.
    * Click "Import Key File" and choose the newly created
xbmc-ppa.key and press OK.

        If you wish to import the key via terminal, use enter the following:
        sudo apt-key add xbmc-ppa.key

Installing XBMC

Now that the repo and key have been added, install XBMC like any other program.

    * Click System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
    * Click "Reload"
    * Search for "xbmc"
    * Mark xbmc and xbmc-standalone for installation and mark
additional changes when prompted.
    * Click "Apply" and agree to the changes after reading them.

XBMC is now installed and ready for use.

Autostart XBMC (optional)

By following these instructions, your system will boot directly into
XBMC rather than your desktop from now on. It is advised that you
delay this step until XBMC is setup as you'd like it.

    * From the desktop click System -> Administration -> Login Window
    * From the "Security" tab choose "Enable Automatic Login" and
select your username.
    * Click "OK" to exit.
    * Logout of your system.
    * From the Login screen choose "Select Session"
    * Choose "XBMC" and click "Change Session"

You're finished. Next time you login you should be greeted with XBMC.

Did you try installing Safari for Windows on Linux using wine? ( i
havent tried it yet).

Konquerer (KDE) and Google - Chrome For Linux (beta) use the same
rendering engine as Safari (WebKit). So you won't miss Apple Safari
much.

But, if you are looking for Safari for benchmarking your application
on how it works in each browser, let me share my experience. We made
our application work on Safari 4 on Windows. But, when some one tried
to use it in Safari for Macintosh, it was a total catastrophe. It
worked well on FireFox for Mac. We had to literally go out of our way
to ask sorry and asked the user to wait for a few more days to make it
work correctly on Mac/Safari.

One good learning was that, if your application is W3C standards
complaint, it might mostly work correctly. But, I wouldnt say that
about Javascript, CSS and Strictness checking.

with regards,
Natarajan.

Message-ID: <201001060601.14786.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

this is a fairly old Mandriva 2008 install. It was working ok. I needed to 
copy some files from an old hard disk that was not booting. Put it in as a 
slave and copied. No problem. after some time, when booting my machine (after 
slave was removed, it said fsck.ext3 error and dropped me to shell. As usual, 
I entered the root passward and started running fsck manually - it was 
/dev/hd5. Answered yes to all 'fix?' questions and it said disk was clean. To 
be sure, I repeated the process - again said disk is clean and asked to 
reboot. I rebooted and the same error crops up. On manual fsck, same errors 
are shown, fixed, disk clean message appears, but no reboot - same problem. How 
to solve this?

this would not give the sense. step in, over, out are technical terms (I 
think). If you translate your suggestions back to english:

error in entering
error in avoiding
error in leaving

maybe the author would comment on this?

My guess
a.Check system date - sometimes date of last check and current system date
doesn't tally.
b. The disk may have bad blocks. 
Possible solutions:
Boot with live cd and run fsck.
Run badblocks on the disk to determine its health.

I sometimes feel that the some English text strings are taken and literally
translated into Tamil word by word and are repositioned to make sense. Which
in my opinion is not a very good idea. Rather, we could just take in the
meaning and find the appropriate word in Tamil. I'm only taking about a
some  sentence strings and not all. Most string translations are fine.
Something like Kriya's Tamil dictionary or Varthamanan could help perhaps??

Someone know where I can get ?????????? ?????? ????? ?????? ??
thanks.

it depends on the string - in the computer world the english itself is very 
often artificial - 'error in step in' is not grammatical english - it is 
awkward as it has a very precise meaning. So maybe the Tamil also needs to be 
a bit artificial

Hi all,

  I need to monitor a directory and when a new file is put into that
directory,i need to capture that file name and process it.

 (Something like a database triggers )

 Any points on this will be useful .

Note:I may store all the filenames and check for any new file after every X
minutes,but that does not seem like a good way for me.

Message-ID: <b3a19c851001060122h16fa850anab6a6f7e3064eb2@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,
       I tried to block gmail access in port no 443 like this

acl block_port port 443
http_access deny block_port

but if I m blocking this port, any other site which is using this port is
also blocked, I just want to block gmail via this port not other sites...

I also tries tried this link

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/how-to-block-https-sites-through-acl-in-squid-702208/

but, these solutions are not able to block https.
I also tried /etc/hosts file

127.0.0.1        localhost.localdomain  localhost   mail.google.com  mail

but, this also fail to stop https. I thought I can write a script which will
be run automatically whenever any client request for
https://mail.google.com but I don't have idea where i should copy the script
so that it should automatically called whenever the above request is
comming....Any idea, plz share or if any body have implemented plz suggest
me how to achieve it.

Thanks for the inputs.

I showed all our discussions to my friend.
she got impressed with these things.

But the college, requires her to do project in a company
which can give a certificate.

Is there any company or consultancy who can help help her
to do MBA project in FOSS related area?

Thanks.

Try Mindzen. I know the Director (Operations) is an Opensource advocate.

But their core application is more geared towards insurance brokers though...

an ERP software.

Found that there are many FOSS ERP software available.
They are as

http://www.openbravo.com
http://www.adempiere.com/index.php/ADempiere
http://www.openerp.com

Need your suggestions on implementing any of these software.
How easy they are to adopt into a company?

Please share your experience on implementing those software in a company.

Thanks a lot.

Subject: [Ilugc] one-application-oneday (Audacity)
Message-ID: <34d63e2b1001060747y4493aaderdb7e071538497893@mail.gmail.com>

Application : Audacity

What it is:   Audacity is a digital audio editor and recording
application. Audacity is free, open source and cross-platform,
available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and BSD.

Audacity was created by Dominic Mazzoni while a graduate student at
Carnegie Mellon University. Mazzoni now works at Google, but is still
the main developer and maintainer of Audacity, with help from many
others around the world.

Audacity Features:

Some of Audacity's features include:

   Importing and exporting WAV, AIFF, MP3 (via the LAME encoder,
downloaded separately), Ogg Vorbis, all file formats supported by
libsndfile library

   Version 1.3.2 and later also support Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)

   Version 1.3.6 and later also support additional formats such as
WMA, AAC and AC3 via the optional FFmpeg library.

   Recording and playing sounds

   Editing via Cut, Copy, Paste (with unlimited Undo)

   Multitrack mixing

   A large array of digital effects and plug-ins. Additional effects
can be written with Nyquist

   Amplitude envelope editing

   Noise removal

   Audio spectrum analysis using the Fourier transformation algorithm

   Support for multi-channel modes with sampling rates up to 96 kHz
with 32 bits per sample

   The ability to make precise adjustments to the audio's speed while
maintaining pitch (Audacity calls it changing tempo), in order to
synchronize it with video, run for the right     length of time, etc.

   The ability to change the audio's pitch without changing the speed.

   Contains major features of modern multi-track audio software[7]
including navigation controls, zoom and single track edit, project
pane and XY project navigation, non-destructive and destructive effect
processing, audio file manipulation (cut, copy, paste)

   Converting cassette tapes or records into digital tracks by
automatically splitting one track into multiple tracks based on
silences in the track and the export multiple option.

    Multi-platform: works on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix-like systems
(including GNU/Linux and BSD), among others.

    The latest stable version supports Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista,
but Windows 95 and NT are not supported. Windows 7 support is still
provisional. For Windows 7, the developers recommend the latest 1.3.x
Beta.[8]

  Audacity uses the wxWidgets software library to provide a similar
graphical user interface on several different operating systems.

  Audacity can also be used for post-processing of all types of audio,
including podcasts. It can be used for finishing podcasts by adding
effects

Install Audacity:

sudo apt-get install audacity

Open Audacity:

I can vouch for openbravo as i work in the release engineer team of
openbravo ;-) There are lots of good adoption happening (close to 1.5
million downloads now). The implementation happens thru partner network.

How easy they are to adopt into a company?

We have recently come out with some thing called openbravo quickstart which
requires 40 to 80 hours of implementation services, and can be delivered in
less than a calendar month. more here

Message-ID: <201001070702.49776.lawgon@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

I had a file 'filename 04 april v3.pdf' - I tried to copy it to another 
directory, but cp refused to oblige. I managed to generate the command by

had to go back to kmail and save the file in the correct directory.

Rosh,

I seem to be missing something. What is the connection?

I was talking about the set command in [1] and you are talking about
auto completion.

I did talk about how to add editline in one of the language classes.

That adds auto completion feature to your program shell.

But I don't see the connection between the set(1) shell command
and auto completion.

By the way I find that nowadays the application specific files alone
show up in auto completion. This is a very nice improvement.

For instance, if you have an xls file, it won't get prompted with

$ xpdf

but it will get prompted with

$ soffice

Cool no?

Try "filename 04 april v3.pdf"and also check directory permissions.

Very typical of Windoze/Winblows generated files. Unfortunately even mp3
players and handhelds seem to have similar issues.

It is so hard to deal with spaces in file names in UNIX but other OSes happily
create such files to make our lives hard.

In fact your question is not quite clear to me.

You can use backslash before every space. For instance, you can do

filename\ 04\ april\ v3.pdf

In case you want to replace all filenames in toto please use the mmv
command. I ran a tip on this very long ago. Please search the
archives.

http://ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc

$ touch 'filename 04 apr v3.pdf'
$ touch 'foo 05 nov v4.pdf'
$ mmv -v "*[ ]*[ ]*[ ]*.pdf" "#1-#5-#7.pdf"
filename 04 apr v3.pdf -> filename-apr-v3.pdf : done
foo 05 nov v4.pdf -> foo-nov-v4.pdf : done

Or you could use tr ' ' '-' if you wish to replace with '-'. You can
also choose
to do it with some other char like underscore or even a letter.

for i in *
do
newname=`echo $i | tr ' ' '-' `
echo $newname
mv "$i" $newname
done

I tried it and this works.

Dear Dhastha,

I appreciate your efforts. But long long ago I used to send
such really long mails.

People find it very hard to digest more than half a page of e-mail.

And that too these things are so technical. Many people will
get immediately switched off the moment they see a mail as big as
yours.

I used to put in a great deal of energy, enthusiasm and love into my
e-mails but they were all ending up in the waste basket without
benefiting anybody.

This is precisely what will happen with you also. I certainly wish to
avoid that.

Kindly make your tips shorter by 15%.

Yes, I mean exactly that.

Instead of this mail you should send,

-------------------------------------------------

What it is:   Audacity is a digital audio editor and recording
 application. Audacity is free, open source and cross-platform,
 available for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and BSD.

 Importing and exporting WAV, AIFF, MP3 (via the LAME encoder,
 downloaded separately), Ogg Vorbis, all file formats supported by
 libsndfile library

----------------------------------------------------

This will do.

The rest they will figure out anyway. And if they don't figure out they
will be none the worse for it. ;)

Thanks.

Please make this correction and it will take you places.

Best of luck and may God shower his blessings for your service!

Thanks once again for this great effort.

Exactly.  That's what I was talking about.  Maybe I should have been
clearer about how I wrote it.  Application specific file completion is
done by those two files I mentioned (if you have sourced them into
your .bashrc)

that works perfectly - even completion. Thanks. I was looking like a fool

I don't think that is possible with mplayer.

Why do you want that ? I find this feature in ffplay and I find it
quite annoying.

Mr. Dhasthageer,

elaborate.

In fact I find the way very simple, knocked down to many simple pieces of

Greetings,

Somehow my googling skills are not upto mark.

Pray can somebody point out resources which works like GnuDIP but
listens to Dyndns protocol as one of the proprietary gateways can talk
only in dyndns or ddo.

Basic scenario: one Private DNS server updating itself using data
thrown at it by various known adsl based client (gateway device) using
dyndns / ddo protocol.

This server will be on a public IP and updates should happen only by
those clients (gateway device). Not much can be done on the device as
it is live and I can't change device.

any help will be appreciated

Regards,

Rajagopal

Again apologies for using roman script:

(kuRi)muRai --> is more appropriate for a method.
 iyakkakkuRi for opcode appears better than iyakkak kuRimuRai

Hi friends,


i have one doubt.

how can we find , whether one package is installed in our system or
not via terminal.

in synaptic , we can see the color difference between installed
packages and non-installed packages.

like wise , how can we find the difference b/w installed and non-installed
package using command ?

In terminal , [for eg]

$ apt-cache search tuxpaint

It will give the package details about tuxpaint

$ apt-get install tuxpaint

It will give result ,

if installed , -> the package tuxpaint is already installed and newest version.

if not installed -> the package size is 29MB.
...
bla bla bla bbblllabba .
...

Need to get 28.9MB of archives.
After this operation, 49.6MB of additional disk space will be used.
Do you want to continue [Y/n]?

so my question is , the alternate command to find out the particular
package is installed or not , via terminal .

i searched in net , but cant get clearly .


any one can suggest me . thanks in advance !

Alternately
aptitude search <package name>
If the first column is 'i', it means the package is installed. See

simple and nice command .
it gives detailed about only installed packages.
for non-installed package , it will return nothing.

it gives very elaborate output for both installed and non-installed packages.



both commands are powerful.

thanks to all. ! .

Make sure you consider what you are building the machine for - and then 
buy lots of ram and lots of disks. And remember, lots of disks is not 
the same as disks with lots of storage. Count the spindles, see what you 
want out of them and then match it up with a CPU that can keep up + a 
bit more.

eg. its pointless strappig on a q9750 on a machine with 1 gb of ram and 
a single 500 gb hdd.

a good place to start is consider what data you have now, how its 
stored, and how its likely to increase in the next 12 months. Then 
consider what your query load is going to look like and how you tune 
mysql itself. Finally match that to a hardware spec. Once you have that 
in mind and on paper, *then* go looking for a vendor and model.

opcode is op(eration) code
If we can arrive at a consensus on what are the apt tamil words for
"operation" and "code" we can club them together as translation for
opcode.

As for assembler : assembler is a translator of assembly mnemonics to opcode.
It logically follows that resolving the tamil word for opcode would
provide us a good clue as to what would be the tamil translation of
assembler.

prevailed even after forking , i say it does not have bells and whistles but
does the job , i am not a functional guy yet ;-(  still if you are

Dear All
I am in the course of setting up a LAMP server on RHEL 5.2. After the successful compilation cum installation of Mysql 5.2, Apache 2.2, I have been making repeated attempt to compile & install Php-5.2.12 like other two through source downloaded from php.net, I am unable to do so.

My guess the makefile has not been generated correctly. What version of
perl are you having in your system, is it compatible with PHP ?

Perl is generally used by configure for generating the makefile, I have
had instances in the past where I have had problems with I had wrong
version of perl.

The error message tells you that make is expecting you to give an 
additional parameter as shown below.

e.g. when you build a kernel you specify "make config", "make bzImage" , 
"make modules"  etc.

Look through the Makefile and see what are the make "targets"

Just out of curiosity, why are you compiling from source when RHEL5.2 
has MySQL, PHP rpms that are more than adequate for a LAMP stack?

true - now that you say so I recall seeing strange chinese looking stuff in 
some configure files - must be perl.

Those are all not errors :)
First you may change your mantis's Administrator password.
After that you have remove the folder  "Admin" which is in
"/var/www/html/mantis"

Dear All
I had gone through the "config.log" file to find some clue in trouble shooting this issue. I was able to detect dependency issues related to some of configure options which I had opted while configuring php. Therefore, I had to remove those options which are having conflict with config to enable php configuration further with make & make install. Hence, I could proceed with my task further successfully but by compromising those options.
Thanks for your support & valuable opinions in this regard
with thanks

Please describe what you did step by step
1. Downloaded file
2. tar xvjf filename.tar.bz2
3. cd php-xxx
4. configure (????)
5. make

Did you do configure with correct options? What was the final output
of configure?

Yes, but, that was not what you asked for in your OP. You only said
"setting up a LAMP server on RHEL 5.2", not manual installation!
Please be precise on what you want to accomplish, in future. Also

I went further on the basis and pointed out the repo containing php 5.2.

RHEL/CENTOS 5 comes with php 5.1.x and (probably) as a policy may not
update it to 5.2 for the lifetime of RHEL/Centos.

That will be the case. CentOS do not provide Live + installable CD for
that reason.

I had similar issue with Python 2.5 on Centos 5.3.

I you want to compile from source, first install development tools.
There will be lot more than what you might actually need, but as long as
you have enough space, do not bother.

$ yum groupinstall "Development tools"

Then compile it. Search on the web, some would have definitely built a
PHP 5.2 rpm. You do it is your own risk.

The point Shakti was trying to make was that if you
are new to unix, don't try to compile your own apps
and put them into production.

The binaries provided by your distro goes through
rigorous testing and are better suited for production
use.  Further, distro binaries are always up to date
with the latest security patches.

An extreme example of  this is OpenBSD were you're
discouraged from compiling your own custom kernel.
You are to run the official GENERIC kernel just like
everyone else.  That's just how it works with OpenBSD.


But if you're purpose is to learn, then I completely
agree that compiling your own apps makes good learning.

After the successful compilation cum installation of Mysql 5.2, Apache 2.2, I have been making repeated attempt to compile & install Php-5.2.12 like other two through source downloaded from php.net, I am unable to do so. Whilst, trying to execute "Make" after configure with options, it outputs error message as follows:

My goodness. This thread seems to have evoked a great deal of
responses.

If configure exits with an error, makefiles will not be generated.

The way autoconf works is that it generates Makefile from Makefile.in
and Makefile.am. And it invokes libtool, autoheader, aclocal, automake
and so on.

All part of the autoconf tool chain. In some cases you have to
generate configure from autogen.sh. This usually happens when you
download
code from a version control repo. Otherwise you only run the
./configure script.

Please try this.

$ ./configure --help | less

Read the various options and see if disabling something lets configure
 generate makefiles correctly. Some dependencies are mandatory
and some optional depending upon what feature is enabled.

Anyway your error clearly says that the configure script existed due
to a possible dependency or version issue.

Hence the makefile "Makefile" (possibly many each per subdir) was not
generated correctly.

You could inspect the file config.log or something similar in the
toplevel directory or simply run configure again.

And also there is nothing wrong in trying to learn all these things someday.

If you stick only to binary packages you will never know.

Looking at the responses I see in this thread the awareness of the way
the autoconf suite works seem pretty poor.

I wonder how configure script can depend on perl. I am yet to see a
situation like that. perl modules have their own "perl Makefile.PL"
way of generating makefiles.

That is not the case here. I wonder.

Best,
Girish

Please get in touch with my friend Sathish in Healthsoft

sathish@healthsoftusa.com for this. He had this issue and I
prodded him in the right direction with the perl SGI::FAM module.

If you are particular about C and do not mind the slight annoyance
with kqueue() you can try that. Is kqueue() there in linux? I wonder.

It is a FreeBSD thing and it works very well in all BSDs.

 I was not very happy with the numerous
other alternatives there. gnome uses a method which is somewhat
 interesting.

Since I did not get working C sample for this I am unable to help
any further.

Actually I was quite surprised that there was no clean approach to
so common a problem.

Ask Sathish and he will help you out.

Thanks.

It doesn't depend on Perl. It is meant to be portable, and since bash
is available on most *nix systems it only requires bash.

On the other hand, if one decides to generate the configure script
from the configure.ac, Makefile.am sources, one will use aclocal,
automake, or autoreconf and these scripts are written in Perl.

  $ less /usr/bin/aclocal
  $ less /usr/bin/automake
  $ less /usr/bin/autoreconf

Few reasons-

* To link against local libraries. The configure scripts are intelligent
enough to find out what is present and what is not. For example, the
BlueZ Bluetooth utils package (Debian 4.x) leaves certain parts like the
pass key agent to be compiled locally (the C version)
* Extreme cases - In a very security sensitive installation, you can audit
the entire or portions of the source code before deployment.
* If the software is dependent on hardware, in most cases, you will have to
compile it yourself.
* In some cases the binary package, for general usage might not have
compiled in special features of the software (which can be selected in the
configure script)

The greatest way to learn 'all about' Linux is to build it from scratch.
Compile every package, including compiling GCC itself through boot
strapping!  Search for "Linux From Scratch". < A recommendation for every
student and people with lots of time.

Keystrokes can be fed to the kernel using the uinput subsystem. The uinput
subsystem can be accessed through the device file /dev/uinput. But the interface
is low-level. A wrapper library called libsuinput
http://codegrove.org/libsuinput/ makes things simpler. The code using the
wrapper library is given below. For the sake of simplicity error handling code
has been omitted.

#include <suinput.h>

int main(void)
{
  struct input_id id = {BUS_BLUETOOTH, 13, 3, 7};
  int uinput_fd = suinput_open("HelloInput", &id);

  suinput_press(uinput_fd, KEY_LEFTCTRL);
  suinput_press(uinput_fd, KEY_LEFTSHIFT);
  suinput_press(uinput_fd, KEY_Y);

  suinput_release(uinput_fd, KEY_Y);
  suinput_release(uinput_fd, KEY_LEFTSHIFT);
  suinput_release(uinput_fd, KEY_LEFTCTRL);

  return 0;
}

Note: You should have uinput module loaded into the kernel. You should have
sufficient privileges to access the device file.

Vijay

After the successful compilation cum installation of Mysql 5.2, Apache 2.2, I have been making repeated attempt to compile & install Php-5.2.12 like other two through source downloaded from php.net, I am unable to do so. Whilst, trying to execute "Make" after configure with options, it outputs error message as follows:

My goodness. This thread seems to have evoked a great deal of
responses.
If configure exits with an error, makefiles will not be generated.
The way autoconf works is that it generates Makefile from Makefile.in
and Makefile.am. And it invokes libtool, autoheader, aclocal, automake
and so on.
All part of the autoconf tool chain. In some cases you have to
generate configure from autogen.sh. This usually happens when you
download
code from a version control repo. Otherwise you only run the
./configure script.
Please try this.
$ ./configure --help | less
Read the various options and see if disabling something lets configure
 generate makefiles correctly. Some dependencies are mandatory
and some optional depending upon what feature is enabled.
Anyway your error clearly says that the configure script existed due
to a possible dependency or version issue.
Hence the makefile "Makefile" (possibly many each per subdir) was not
generated correctly.
You could inspect the file config.log or something similar in the
toplevel directory or simply run configure again.
And also there is nothing wrong in trying to learn all these things someday
If you stick only to binary packages you will never know.
Looking at the responses I see in this thread the awareness of the way
the autoconf suite works seem pretty poor.
I wonder how configure script can depend on perl. I am yet to see a
situation like that. perl modules have their own "perl Makefile.PL"
way of generating makefiles.
That is not the case here. I wonder.
Best,
Girish

Subject: [Ilugc] Tips of the day (Printing PostScript files)
Message-ID: <f4348d691001090459u489a72dfg6840a164bda753ce@mail.gmail.com>

Printing (.ps) files
Most linux applications can generate postscript files, which usually have
the extension '.ps'.

Postscript is a language that describe how things should be drawn on pages;
this language is understood by postscript printers. Non-postscript printers
needs special drivers that convert from postscript onto their own format.

If the ghostcript package is installed on your system, it is possible to
convert pdf files in postscript with the pdf2ps command:

*pdf2ps paper.pdf*

creates paper.ps.

You can preview a postscript file on the screen with gv or kghostview:

*gv file.ps

kghostview file.ps*

To put the 'file.ps' into the printing queue of the printer known as
'printername':

*lpr -P printername file.ps *

The printers can be attached to the local system via a parallel, serial, or
USB port, or available over the network. To get a list of available
printers:

*lpstat -p -d*

To check the status of all printers:
*
lpstat -a*

To remove a printing job:

*lprm job-id*

(job-id is the number reported by the lpr or lpstat commands).

If your system uses the printing system 'CUPS', you can access its
documentation by opening the following address in a browser:

*http://localhost:631/documentation.html*

*To install ghostscript & gv*

sudo apt-get install ghostscript
sudo apt-get install gv

the code given at the above link seems to use the uinput API directly
and not the libsuinput.

> but even after running the program, nothing happens, as in I don see

and I had to change the input device from "/dev/uinput" to
"/dev/input/uinput". And ran the program as root.

Subject: [Ilugc] How to roll back an interrupted ubuntu update?
Message-ID: <636042.42434.qm@web94612.mail.in2.yahoo.com>

Hi!

A friend of mine tried updating Ubuntu 9.10 post installation. He was using Toshiba? satellite laptop and the update process had to be interrupted due some reasons. Later? he found that Ubuntu doesn't? boot in and it displayed the following error :

Failed to load module
i810 module does not exist
glx error: cannot get required symbols

I tried googling, but couldn't find any satisfying solution, one of which is to press <shift> key after turning on the laptop and to? proceed with the recovery options.? Finally , i had no other option that to suggest him to backup important docs by booting in through live CD and then make a fresh installation. Since Ubuntu9.10 uses Grub2 i couldn't use my rescue disk? that works with Ubuntu9.04.

Now my question is, in case if an ubuntu update is interrupted, is it possible to rollback the updates(something like system restore in XP)?

p.s. He is not using? dual boot OS' . His laptop runs only Ubuntu9.10 and he is newbie to Linux

Thank You !

Use find2perl to generate yourself a code template
which you can modify to suit your needs. And yes,
you need to code a few lines of perl.

I used it. Its good and usable. You can get test packages of chromium from
http://spot.fedorapeople.org/chromium/ or add chromium repo to your fedora
installation. The baseurl is
http://spot.fedorapeople.org/chromium/F$releasever/.

I use it to do some testing, and it is pretty stable. For casual
browsing, it fares very well on Fedora 11 as well as 12. For prolonged
browsing, Firefox is tops though. The latest beta from the
repositories is very stable. Try it out, you won't regret it.

This is how it is done:

As superuser:

#  echo "[chromium]
   name = Chromium Test Packages
   baseurl=http://spot.fedorapeople.org/chromium/F\$releasever/
   enabled=1
   gpgcheck=0 " > /etc/yum.repos.d/chromium.repo

Then use yum update; yum install chromium

What exactly to you mean by prolonged browsing. Do you mean merely browsing
for long hours?

Yeah. Browsing for a long time, with many tabs. Firefox 3.5 and 3.6
use far less memory than Chrome, at least on my machines. I should
have called it 'power browsing' or 'vettiness' :P

Isn't that by design ?

By using a separate process per tab, Chrome is trading off speed and
security with memory usage.

It is, and a long browsing session with many tabs and add-ons can
almost bring my desktop (albeit a ~5 years old one) to a halt. I use
Chrome mostly to test some web applications, or for a quick mail
check. Firefox is quite slick at this task.

Message-ID: <f4348d691001100737sa3b8c1fgb5cb3e841cfa529f@mail.gmail.com>

Imagine, you did the checksum on the ISO and you burned the CD, still
you want to double check the integrity of the files on the CD . . . .

Here is a little script that will do the checksum on your CDs. You do
need the original checksum to compare with the outcome of this script.

Steps

1. Open terminal and type

$ vi checkcd
press "i" ( to put vi in insertmode )

2. Type the following code in vi editor

#!/bin/sh
#checkcd

device=$1

blocksize=`isoinfo -d -i $device | grep "^Logical block size is:" |
cut -d " " -f 5`
if test "$blocksize" = ""; then
? ? ?echo catdevice FATAL ERROR: Blank blocksize >&2
? ? ?exit
fi

blockcount=`isoinfo -d -i $device | grep "^Volume size is:" | cut -d " " -f 4`
if test "$blockcount" = ""; then
? ? ?echo catdevice FATAL ERROR: Blank blockcount >&2
? ? ?exit
fi

command="dd if=$device bs=$blocksize count=$blockcount conv=notrunc,noerror"
echo "$command" >&2
$command

3. Save the file with suitable name, here for example save it as "chechcd".

4. Give the read and execute permission to that file

$ sudo chmod 755 checkcd

5. Execute the following command to check CD

$ sudo ./checkcd /dev/cdrom | md5sum

If you don't pass any argument, the script must atleast display the
usage of the script and exit cleanly. Also do check if 'isoinfo' is
available on the system where the script is to be executed, else,
inform the user about it.

Hi,

as a normal user, you can not write any files in /var/www

To change this, give full write permissions to all users for that folder.

sudo chmod -R a+w /var/www

Now you can write files in that folder.

This permissions is only for the personal development machine.

Try this and update your results.

Regards,
Shrini

it is an editor - it is useful for editing code (handles python/html/xml/css 
and other types also). It is very lightweight but has all the features one 
needs in a code editor.

this is not good advice - even for a personal development machine one should 
always do the right thing. Once people get into bad habits, it is difficult to 
correct later. Never ever fool with permissions on a nix system unless it is 
in your home directory. Those permissions are given with good reasons and 30 
years or more of experience. Do not tamper with them.

Hi,

do a google search before asking in a list.

Google will give you a lot of links.

they imported the pictures and added the text in inkscape. The output was 900 
dpi png files which they gave to the printer. Some of the features of inkscape 
were demonstrated. Like moving objects, drawing filled rectangles, entering and 
editing text, saving in specific resolutions. Also the large variety of file 
formats that inkscape can open, and a subset of these formats that inkscape 
can write to. I do not know if they entered the dates manually or wrote a 
script to generate them.

If it is fedora,

su -c "chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html"

on debian derivatives,

sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/

add user to that group.

and why is this not done by the distributors of fedora/debian? And what is the 
justification of altering the permissions they have given?

Would be excellent if they had written a script for that. Making all the
calendars  becomes a a breeze. Any idea how they aligned them in place?
rulers or something? [dumb question 1] . Did they mention anything about how
to draw polygons? [dumb question 2 ]

That is surprising. I thought it's the other way round. People have the idea
that firefox is bloated. Is anyone else finding chrome using more memory per

How is that a tradeoff?? Isn't that supposed to be good having per process
tabs? I've always been annoyed when one tab freezes and takes the whole
browser down with it.. How is it a tradeoff of speed and security?

No. we didnt used any script to generate the dates.

We typed the dates as simple text.(manually)

In inkscape , we have Grid option to view alignments.

Go to inkscape  -> view  -> enable/disable Grid

or

we can draw our own alignments using Guide , manually.

Webserver is not a default functionality expected out of a OS. A
customised Webserver release can be expected to do that.

I presume they retain the permissions that comes default, even after
installing apache & /var/www need not be document root.

Please verify how Ubuntu & Fedora handles phpmyadmin etc., when
installed through their respective apt or yum.

Usually, It doesn't. Unless you open an "incognito" window.

i have been running remote servers (both vps and dedicated servers) which 
presumably are expected to be webservers, and have yet to see these 
permissions changed.

I have no idea. And anyway, I feel that if anyone asks how to save php (or any 
files) under /var/www I would advise them to set up a directory on their home 
directory and save them there - they can be accessed through a virtual host. I 
would further advise them not to touch /var/www in any way. Except for maybe 
altering the default index.html (which can be done by root and is usually 
rarely changed during the lifetime of the server)

Tried 2 different GMail a/cs in the incognito mode and it signed me out from
both the account tabs giving the same message "You've been signed out as
you've logged into another account".

Checkout https://hudson.dev.java.net/

I have been using this for a while and its good. I use to use
CruiseControl previously. Hudson offers more features compared to  CC. It
has a lot of plug-in's contributions and has a very active community.

When I evaluated Hudson I also had a look at continuum, it gave a good
competition. continuum as very intuitive and feature rich, but was not
mature enough when I evaluated it a year and a half back.

You get increased speed and security which is needed but you also get
increased memory usage which is not desired.

To put it crudely:
Speed, Security, Memory Usage. Pick any two.

What KG meant was that you could login into two accounts, one each in normal
and in incognito window. Not two in the incognito mode itself.

Subject: [Ilugc] Tokenizer in python
Message-ID: <loom.20100111T073218-120@post.gmane.org>

Hi guys,
   I want to parse a "C source code file" using python.I want to separate each
and every string in the c file to process in python.

For example,
  #include<stdio.h>
  int main()
  {
     int i=0;
     for(i=0;i<10;i++)
     {
       printf("i = %d",i);
     }
     return(0);
  }

Then i want to tokenize this file like this.

#include<stdio.h>
int,main,(,),{,int,i,=,0,;,for,(,i,=,0,i,<,10 ....( Like that i want to parse
the entire file)

I am new to python.I tried split command.But it can split by using separator.So
i cant exactly tokenize the file as i like.Guys i am really in need of doing
this.Waiting for your replies.
             Thank you.

Educating someone on how to post correctly is also valuable suggestion.

It's annoying to see posts with poor formatting, spelling, or grammar.  I'm
glad that someone, especially Kenneth, is taking the pains to correct it.

No matter how rudely someone corrects you on a mailing list, it shows
that the person has taken the effort to help you correct your mistakes and
wants you to grow.  Personally, I don't bother correcting mistakes, I just
exercise my delete button and move on.

So stop bashing people who pick on list etiquettes.

Linux in a Nutshell (by O'Reilly publishing) presents the various Linux 
tools in a very well organized way.  INR 500 for the South East Edition 
paper version is well worth it.

Message-ID: <f4348d691001110503k79b0f4d1n371e763e4628b445@mail.gmail.com>

 Unmounting the unresponsive DVD drive:-

Here's how you find the process that holds your DVD drive and eject it
to your heart's content: First, simulate it. Stick a disk in your DVD
drive, open up a terminal, and mount the DVD drive:

# mount /media/cdrom
# cd /media/cdrom
# while [ 1 ]; do echo "All your drives are belong to us!"; sleep 30; done

Now open up a second terminal and try to eject the DVD drive:

# eject

You'll get a message like:

umount: /media/cdrom: device is busy

Before you free it, let's find out who is using it.

# fuser /media/cdrom

You see the process was running and, indeed, it is our fault we can
not eject the disk.

Now, if you are root, you can exercise your godlike powers and kill processes:

# fuser -k /media/cdrom

Boom! Just like that, freedom. Now solemnly unmount the drive:

# eject

fuser is good.

    We as a team working for writing a CC-By-SA licensed textbook for
class 11th. You can look for syllabus here
http://code.google.com/p/cbse-065/wiki/syllabus , syllabus include
Java/MySQL .
     I would like to make a request to  Python and PostgreSQL
community to design a new syllabus for CBSE class 11th which include
python and PostgreSQL in place of Java/MySQL . Community members can
join http://code.google.com/p/cbse-065 to start this initiative too.
http://code.google.com/p/cbse-065/wiki/Alternate_Syllabus
     I as a educationalist believe that we must teach "vendor neutral
education". At the same time we must teach multiple community based
products (like MySQL with PostgreSQL, GTK , Phthon with Java).
     You can join our project and start making book/syllabus. These
changes in syllabus may be included in future. At the same time even
if these things are not there in syllabus, If book is ready with
alternate tools , student might get better exposure to FOSS world.

just 2 more cents in FOSS world

Hi, everyone,

I have a TV tuner card (bt878) which works fine under Linux. The only
problem I have is that I need to be at the keyboard to actually do
anything. Does anyone know where I can get one of those little serial IR
receivers and perhaps a corresponding remote? I'm not looking for any
high-end stuff, just a receiver and remote which both work with LIRC.

Thanks for reading,

Message-ID: <34d63e2b1001110632g6389eed3x8e18960510e1f569@mail.gmail.com>

Application: GParted

What it is:

GParted (abbreviated as GPT) is a GTK+ frontend to GNU Parted and the
official GNOME Partition Editor application.

It is used for creating, deleting, resizing, moving, checking and
copying partitions, and the file systems on them. Reorganizing disk
usage, copying data residing on hard disks and mirroring one partition
with another (disk imaging).

Extra to know:

It uses libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partition
tables while several (optional) file system tools provide support for
file systems not included in libparted. These optional packages will
be detected at runtime and do not require a rebuild of GParted.

GParted is written in C++ and uses gtkmm to interface with GTK+. The
general approach is to keep the GUI as simple as possible and in
conformity with the Human interface guidelines.[specify]

The GParted project provides a live operating system including GParted
which can be written to a Live CD, a Live USB and other media. The
operating system is based on Debian GNU/Linux. GParted is also
available on other GNU/Linux live CDs, including recent versions of
Knoppix and Parted Magic.

Features:

GParted supports the following operations on file systems

btrfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, Extended, FAT16, FAT32, HFS, HFS+, JFS, swap,
NTFS, Reiser4, ReiserFS, UFS, XFS, ZFS, GParted does not support
logical volume management (LVM) at present.

Installation:

sudo apt-get install gparted

Is this a legal copy?  If not then do not post such links.

Can you not save and pay Rs. 500 for a book which is fundamental for 
system admin knowledge?

IIRC, O'Reilly has not "opened" up this title as a "free" book.

Many years back I had tried one. The receiver was made by soldering the
components as per the drawing in the LIRC doc. I tried with three remotes -
2 unknown brands and one of sony. It worked with all three. I forget the
details but I remember, the sony remote's signal was distinctive from the
other two.

    Installing Microsoft Fonts
    <http://embraceubuntu.com/2005/09/09/installing-microsoft-fonts/>
    /September 9, 2005/

Even if you use OpenOffice, you might still want all the *Microsoft 
TrueType fonts* so that documents created using Word or PowerPoint look 
as they were supposed to when you open them with OpenOffice. Also, with 
the Microsoft Fonts installed we browsing will be better since the pages 
will look as the designer originally intended them to. Most webpages are 
designed with Microsoft fonts in mind. The stylesheet specify these 
fonts. On Linux, when these specified fonts are not available on your 
computer, they are replaced with generic equivalents. With these fonts 
installed, you will see the page as it was designed. To install the 
fonts, all you need to do in Ubuntu is to install the *msttcorefonts* 
package. Instructions for installation are given below.

HI,
I found the following package in the website given below: It may be 
useful to the persons who are intended to migrate or recently migrated 
to Ubuntu. They need some MS fonts until they recognize their favorite 
font in linux. Pls any one explain how to install since it deals about 
repositories i need some help.

Chandran.

The Truetype Microsoft fonts provided by the package include:

    * Andale Mono
    * Arial Black
    * Arial (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)
    * Comic Sans MS (Bold)
    * Courier New (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)
    * Georgia (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)
    * Impact
    * Times New Roman (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)
    * Trebuchet (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)
    * Verdana (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)
    * Webdings


        Installing Microsoft Truetype fonts on Ubuntu

You can install the MS core fonts by installing the *msttcorefonts* 
package. To do this, enable the ?Universe? component of the repositories 
<https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto>. This is done by 
default in Feisty. After you do that, use the following command from the 
command line:

|$sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts|

This will give you the core fonts, but if there are other TrueType fonts 
that you want installed, it is as easy as copying the font files to the 
/~/.fonts// directory.

After installing new fonts, you will have to log out and log in again to 
be able to see and use the new fonts. If you want to avoid this, you can 
regenerate the fonts cache by issuing the following command:
|$sudo fc-cache -fv|

Hi

I have installed xubuntu 9.1 in a Intel P III/256mb/40gb box. It was
working fine for few days. Suddenly
it fails to boot giving the following message after getting updated to
latest kernel. I shall appreciate if someone guide me
to solve this problem.

 X doesn't start (important). It gives the following error messages on
the console:

Linux has had this as a capability for a long time. Please look up
http://www.lartc.org for more details or google for QOS Howtos on Linux or
look up http://www.tldp.org for howtos across scenarios.

While it may not seem very obvious, this is done by implementing egress QOS
on the LAN facing interface(s) on a Linux machine used as a gateway, most
often assuming gateway generated traffic to the LAN is pretty insignificant.
This is valid in most cases. Where it is not, gateway initiated traffic is
also treated as a class and monitored.

Does the both services need to run on only port 80?

If not, run apache on a port other than 80.
then, the second app will run pleasantly.

Can you be more clear on what those 2 services are? Is the latter
trying to run on port 80? Can it not run on a different port? Can it
not use apache?

Hi Zico,

There two ways to solve this. In apache use virual hosting so that it
binds to different ip address. So both can run without needing to
apply port numbers in browser. Or you can change the port so that you
can use the same ip address, if you are running short of ip addresses.

Hi,

A few things:
a. You don't need to scream out your subject, we can all read lowercase letters 
just fine.
b. Your mail seems random. It is not clear if you just copy/pasted a random blog 
post or authored that and pasted it here.
c. In either case, the content is *old*. We no longer "still want all the 
Microsoft TrueType fonts ...etc, etc". We thankfully have *free*, drop in

if this is meant to be a reply, it is rude. Please try to be polite. And

not exactly - in firefox, login in tab 1 as user1, go to tab 2 and login to the 
same account as user2, if you go back to tab1, where you are logged in as 
user1, the moment you do an action, you get logged in as user 2. I just

if yum is not working you are in deep trouble anyway - why is yum not working? 
that must be solved first. you must try and repair yum - if it is FUBAR, then 
you may have to consider the (windozy) idea of taking backup and reinstalling. 
A system where stuff is partially installed with yum, partially with standalone 
RPMs and partially with source installs is very difficult to maintain and 
becomes more difficult every day. (I an expert in the confusion this causes as 
in the late 90s and early 2000s when rpms were often broken, out of date most 
of my systems were in this messy state.

2. In saner moments, I read about these modes a little more. These do not
maintain any history or cookies once you exit. However, it seems that during
the sessions, these do exist. Should be, else GMail would keep asking for
uid/pwd.
3. Like Akilan said, it does seems that Chrome maintains separation between
these two i.e I could login as user1 in a normal chrome window and user2 in
an incognito chrome window at the same time.
4. FF did not allow two windows, one in normal and another in the "Private
Browsing" mode though. If I've two FF windows and swtich one to "Private
Browsing" mode, the other normal window disappears. The other normal windows
appears again when I exit "Private Browsing" mode thus bringing back 2 FF
windows.

Use http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/2/simple/2 

Check your CentOS version. Search for libelf.so

Appear it is from
ftp.centos.org/5.3/os/i386/CentOS/elfutils-libelf-devel-0.137-3.el5.i386.rpm

Install it through "yum install elfutils-libelf-devel"

Then install the rpm package.

Ensure that the package your are trying to install, is unavailable from
the repos. 

yum list | grep <package name>

should help you.

If any further dependency crop up, enjoy resolving it :-)

Firstly, it is not clear from your mail whether you have added the EPEL repos to 
your system:
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#howtouse

IIRC, the clamav packages are available in these repos for RHEL/CentOS.

If you have already done that, what exact error are you getting with yum ? Could 
you please paste the output of:

$ yum install clamav
or
$ yum install "clamav*" # depending on your requirements

Secondly, one common problem (especially with packages that are not available in 
the standard repos like the official RHEL repos or EPEL repos) is that the arch 
specific dependency is not specified while building the rpm.

So, for instance if you are trying to install a 32 bit rpm (ie: package name 
ending with i[356]86.rpm) on a 64 bit system (ie: uname -m says x86_64), the 
package might not automatically pull in the required arch specific packages and 
instead just complain about some dependency which 'appears' to be already fulfilled.

If this happens you can make the arch explicit by saying for instance:

$ yum install elfutils-libelf-devel.i686


HTH,

Hi,

Anyone know how to configure the virtual IP on the same Ethernet interface(ethx) ?
I mean, Configure the multiple IPs on eth0, not eth0:0 or eth0:1

There is a way to do using RTNETLINK, But I am not able to find any resource in the internet.
If anyone have come across some utility or RTNETLINK please share your ideas.

Thanks
Suresh

Yes you can do that, but it is not persistent.

ifconfig eth0:1 <NEW_IP_ADDRESS>
ifconfig eth0:2 <NEW_IP_ADDRESS>
ifconfig eth0:3 <NEW_IP_ADDRESS>

and so on. :)

Since everything in Linux is a file, you can create a virtual NIC by
duplicating the eth0 device file.

Im sorry, the previous was a top post. ;)

Although, top posting is bad, leaving out context is also just as bad (if not 
worse). Please use interleaved posting.

To the OP, you asked:
> Anyone know how to configure the virtual IP on the same Ethernet interface(ethx) ?
> I mean, Configure the multiple IPs on eth0, not eth0:0 or eth0:1

What exactly do you mean ? If you do not want the association of eth0:X with the 
IP, how else will you refer to the device associated with the IP ? (for instance 
while using the ifconfig, route or iptable commands).

AFAICT[1], RTNETLINK is refers to the netfilter API to manipulate the kernel 
routing tables not any user space tool to assign IP addresses to NICs

Application: Umbrello UML Modellar

What it is:

Umbrello UML Modeller is a Unified Modelling Language diagram editor
for KDE. It can create diagrams of software and other systems in the
industry-standard
UML format, and can also generate code from UML diagrams in a variety
of programming languages.

Features:

Umbrello handles all the standard UML diagram types. It can reverse
engineer code written in C++, IDL, Pascal/Delphi, Ada, Python, and
Java, as well as import XMI files generated by external tools from PHP
([1]) or Perl code ([2], [3]) and export to various programming
languages.

Umbrello allows distribution of model contents by exporting to DocBook
and XHTML formats. This aids in collaborative development efforts
where team members may not have direct access to Umbrello, or in cases
where model contents should be published on a web site.

It is released along the kdesdk module of KDE.

Supported export programming languages

    * ActionScript
    * Ada
    * C#
    * C++
    * D
    * IDL
    * Java
    * JavaScript
    * Pascal
    * Perl
    * PHP
    * Python
    * Ruby
    * SQL
    * Tcl
    * XML Schema

Hi all,

Linux boot up.
Yes, even after adding quiet parameter to kernel, we see much boot
information.
In case of Live distro, its about ISO Linux configuration.
How to remove this boot information?

Message-ID: <f4348d691001120524s5e1fe482ic1d85228b0434192@mail.gmail.com>

Hai friends, today we see about how to delete the forgotten password.

Step 1: For Redhat and Mandrake:-

Then boot from your first install CD and as the very first screen
comes up hit F2 and type:

rescue ( For RedHat "linux rescue" )

and the computer will boot in rescue mode.

It will show a few alternatives, select : ?mount the existing
partitions? and go to the shell/console prompt.

( Booting Mandrake in "failsafe" from the Lilo menu does the same )


Step 1: For SUSE:

Boot from your first install CD and press F1 at the first screen, then
choose "Rescue System" from the menu and at the prompt type "root" (
you do not need a password )


Step 1: For other distro's

Boot from the first install CD ( or any Live CD like Knoppix ) and at
the bootprompt type:

# cd /etc

We need to change two files; ?passwd? and ?shadow? in "/etc".

# vi passwd
( opens the file )

press  'i' ( puts vi in insertmode )

This is the first line:

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash


Make it:

root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash


So just get writ of the ?x? do not touch the ?:? ( colons )

Save the file:
Esc
ZZ


Second file to be changed:

CODE
# vi shadow

( open the file )
< i > ( insert mode )

The first line is a long scrambled line of characters, just make it:

root:::: ( four colons ! )


Save the file
Esc
ZZ

Now you can reboot your computer. Log in as administrator , open a
console and type the following command.

$ passwd root

Set the new root password !
And the job is done !!

If you have this urge to retort to every barb aimed at you you'll have a
very stressful life. Learn to take it in your stride. Having the last word
does not mean you have won the argument. It only means others do not want to
communicate with you. And that's bad only for you.

What I'm trying to say is the file you mentioned in your reply[1] 
(/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/<whatever>), is the 'config' file for the NIC as 
opposed to the /device/ file.

A device file has a very specific meaning in linux. A device file in linux is 
something that is associated with a driver and has a major and minor number.

Please do read the wikipedia link that I sent you. Arguing about this further 
undermines your credentials as a RHCE that your sig claims you are.

Message-ID: <ed2d3c001001120552o5aef2458j8eff069438597bca@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

There was a initiative from Mr.Pratap Kumar Ex MC, He has taken an
initiative from his ward development fund to setup a computer centre. I went
over there and had a brief chat with him. There is a place (approx 150). The
place has electricity facility.There is NO computers. Mr. Pratap Kumar is
eager in making this computer centre to work.
The centre is situated in a middle class area.

I learnt from Mr.Pratap, that the centre needs computers and faculty
support. Is there any way that we could help this venture.

Please add your thoughts.

Cheers,

isn't this a old way, can't we go to single user mode  (passing a argument

AFAIK, there is no way to remove the isolinux loading message (at the most, you 
can clear the message as soon as isolinux boot env. is up by setting up a 
'display' filename). Setting the kernel parameter does not help because the 
message is shown up /before/ the kernel even loads.

In any case, it is a good thing to at least have that message show up so that 
you know whether your boot media is working (as opposed to any other issues you 
might have if you face problems booting off the media).

Further more, since you already have BIOS messages popping up, on most systems, 
over which you have not control, i don't the the big issue with the one extra 
line that iso/syslinux shows.

Yes, As suggested by Mr. Sreekanth,

press e (editmode) in grub.
append either  '1' or 's'
then use passwd command to reset or remove :)

See, as was pointed out in some other discussion earlier, you are
prefixing the beginning of your reply with a '>' which is why your
reply looks as it does above.

-1 for the useless noise and personal attacks that have been brewing
up in this list recently.

I've always just added 'single' to the kernel line in grub but I use
only Ubuntu and thought that the fact that it gave you a chance to be
root without any password was a result of it not having a root password.

Message-ID: <d29d0f941001120609s5ae52e44l827c633768c52616@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone... I have Fedora 9 in my machine and lately I am noticing a
slightly lesser resolution in my monitor..i.e., 1024 x 768 though I had
originally configured it for 1440 x 900

[sugantha@localhost ~]$ xrandr
Screen 0: minimum 320 x 240, current 1024 x 768, maximum 1024 x 768
default connected 1024x768+0+0 0mm x 0mm
   1024x768       60.0*
   800x600        60.0     56.0
   640x480        60.0
   512x384        60.0
   400x300        60.0     56.0
   320x240        60.0

I edited my xorg.conf as below

Section "Screen"
        Identifier "Screen0"
        Device     "Videocard0"
        Monitor    "Monitor0"
        DefaultDepth     24
        SubSection "Display"
           Depth       8
           Modes      "1400x900" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
        EndSubSection
        SubSection "Display"
           Depth       16
           Modes      "1400x900" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
        EndSubSection
        SubSection "Display"
           Depth       24
           Modes      "1400x900" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
        EndSubSection
        SubSection "Display"
           Depth       32
           Modes      "1400x900" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
        EndSubSection
EndSection

Still I dont get '1440 x 900' listed in the System Display's resolution
dropdown list. The resolution is just fine when I boot windows. I know this
is a common issue but somehow googling around did' nt help me fix this. So
please suggest what I can do to get back my resolution. Thanks in advance.

Very Good Initiative, Is it by any chance F/OSS is going to exist their. If
yes then it's  excellent. Please let us know what they want in their system
Linux or M$

I think 6 system can be accommodated in that  place if we stretch it to the
extend  then we can 8 system's.

 I have some suggestions here, instead of going for an assembled system,
they can look for banded one. I prefer Dell, if I want to buy one myself,
but not sure they are selling with free dos without windows in desktop
level.

Now, go here and read the name of the person you were initially replying to:

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2010-January/054714.html

...here I was simply correctly the misinformation that you were spouting (and 
apparently believing):

http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2010-January/054718.html

...and do you want to guess the reason you seem to have got confused ?

a. You did not quote or retain context
b. You top-posted and
c. You are just so bent on making mistakes and then defending them.

IMO, cramming too many PC's (and that many users) inside such a small room
can make it unbearably hot in summer to the point that the systems fail. I'm
assuming it wont have an a/c!

You haven't mentioned your video card. Since you mentioned that you had 
originally configured X for the correct resolution, i suspect that a driver 
change/update must have affected the setting.

In any case, my recommendation is to update your Fedora installation as soon as 
possible, since even Fedora 10 reached it's end-of-life recently (so, there 
won't be any updates/bug fixes for it and any prior releases).

Thanks steve, I remember i have done something similar a year before, in
ubuntu 8.10 remastering work. But the site that had the exact info is now
down.
The boot display information is inside isolinux/isolinux.bin file in the iso
of our distro.
It seems to be a binary file. Is there a way to edit it?
Have anyone modified ISOlinux this way??

How!? Bcoz network interface is not connected to any device file.

It is not like direct assignment of IP. Some other trick and is
related to multicast. Let me try to recollect that.

No. You can do this using the following command:
# ip address add dev eth0 192.168.10.1/24 broadcast +
# ip address add dev eth0 192.168.20.1/24 broadcast +

Show the associated IPs (ifconfig won't show this):
$ ip address show eth0

IPs are locally reachable. Please test the reachability of this
IP(s) from an another machine and share the result.

In this process, I learned that, we can create alias interface with
any name (10 chars max):

# ifconfig eth0:abcdefghij 192.168.30.1 up
# ifconfig eth0:1234567890 192.168.40.1 up

Message-ID: <9d3184461001121043r602e5c9cy611d74e86ee3bd10@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I've just installed Ubuntu 9.10 along with Fedora Core 11. My disk now looks
like this:

/dev/sda1 ntfs
/dev/sda2 FC 11 boot
/dev/sda3 lvm2
|-- /dev/mapper/VolGroup-LogVol01 /
|-- /dev/mapper/VolGroup-LogVol02 /var
|-- /dev/mapper/VolGroup-LogVol03 /usr
/dev/sda4 ext3
/dev/sda5 FC 11 swap
/dev/sda6 ext3
/dev/sda7 9.10 boot
/dev/sda8 91.0 /


When I reboot, I get grub, which has entries listed for both systems,
but when I try to boot Fedora now, I get an error message: "error: You need
to load the kernel first". On the other hand their is no issue with the
Ubuntu

I've tried booting manually from the grub command line, but the commands
no longer appear to be the same, as Ubuntu is now using grub 2. Here are
the relevant section from grub.cfg (menu.lst is now obsolete):

#menuentry "Fedora (2.6.31) (on /dev/sdb2)" {
        #set root=(hd1,8)
#       insmod ext2
#       set root=(hd1,2)

Dear friends,

I just want to know some statistical data which I believe NRCFOSS and others can provide me for sharing with my higher-ups who have enquired with me.

1. NRCFOSS's FOSS Elective has been adopted by how many colleges and Universities in? India?
2. Is FOSS subject, a part of curriculum in Colleges/Universities abroad?

With regards,

In universities abroad, generally there is no separate subject/course
teaching Open Source. However, people encourage / use a number of
open-source tools/applications (e.g. moodle, mediawiki, *nix) for
their regular courses (I am yet to see a lab/univ using turboC ;) ).
They also strive to open-source whatever work they produce from their
research. In fact , off-late there are a number of research groups who
push themselves to publish reproducible results; i.e. one can pick up
their tools, code and some platform details and reproduce the results
in-order to facilitate improvements by other research groups around
the globe.

Some university have Open Source labs like http://open.utoronto.ca/
and http://osuosl.org/

There might be _very_ special(ised) cases where they have a separate
course titled "Free and Open Source Software". I am not aware of many.

Hope that helps.

Aanjhan

I'd like to know use cases where one needs an address without the secondary
prefix on the device.

wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_
UP> mtu 1300 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:13:02:ac:65:90 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.1.3/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global wlan0
    inet 192.168.1.124/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global secondary wlan0

On the broadcast IP being reachable from outside, I'd reckon it would be
reachable as ip ad sh shows its scope as global. The address terms it as
secondary and broadcast is still all-ones bitwise OR. ifconfig does not show
this.

Seems to me that ifconfig does not show this address as it does not have a
label. Not sure though.

This command works. This what I have expected.
How "ip address" command differs from ifconfig command.

Why ifconfig doesn't show this ip?

Yes its reachable. I have added the route.

Dear Satya,

I get a feeling that always such postings tagged as "commercial" or
whatever should be taken offline and replied in private.

Otherwise you are boring other people.

Sorry if I sounded a bit offensive. Did not mean it.

Have alook in the monitor type and set it to the model you have.

I used to face this problem when only the system got transplanted and
not the monitor.

Be careful about vertical and horizontal frequencies. I have fried one
crt monitor during my early days while playing around with X windows.

If I remember right, realtek site hosts the drivers. I remember
getting them sometime recently.

No it was done with some purpose in public , companies and individuals come
with commercial tags exactly with the same purpose "advertise" and when
somebody is questioning in public about the $ factor , I don't understand
why people should be  hush hush , when there is something commercial , my
idea of asking being curious serves some purposes.

I don't think so , actually they are interested in knowing what is there at
the end of the tunnel after he has learned all those technologies and $ i
think is a good motivation for learning.

No i did not and  will not feel anything  and by raising such questions in
public i feel as employers are choosy in getting people on board  so as
individuals also have a right to say No ,  and knowing what i asked for is
an important part of that decision making process ,  i feel disclosing such
information will keep all party happy

1) people who think its too less they don't apply. so less Resumes for
employers and less interviews and hence saves time and $.
2) people who are learning certain technologies gets the feel like carrot
and starts learning even harder.
3) generally it will set some mark as in what it takes to be get paid hence
better people.
4) overall FOSS ecosystem will grow further.

way to do it in firefox of course is to have two instances of firefox with 
different profiles - then no problem. (advisable also to have a 36 inch monitor 
for this).

On Debian you can edit /etc/default/bootlogd to enable bootlogd and can
suppress boot and kernel messages.

better universities abroad go for concept based education rather than tool 
based education. So the idea of FOSS as such does not enter. However many 
countries in the European Union are working on FOSS syllabi.

Redundancy. Bcoz I learned this only when I was playing with VRRP.

This addresses are very similar to alias and ifconfig will show this
IP addresses once a label added to it.

# ip address add dev eth0 192.168.10.1/24 broadcast + label eth0:one

Most of the commands are just a interface to the Kernel API. 
ifconfig provides less interfaces and ip provides more.

I think passing a -P<profile_name> should work. A -profileManager
cmdline used to display the various profiles available. I am not sure
if it helps open multiple a/cs, but the two profiles used to have
different settings.

Message-ID: <c2eba33f1001122213h4db08b0fvd0f17a3ffa1a948d@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I have been using cscope to search keywords like function-calls using
vim editor. It has been very useful to me. The cscope_maps.vim was put
in the /usr/share/vim/vim61/plugin/cscope_maps.vim in Linux RedHat 9.
And it was working perfectly fine. Now I have shifted to a new working
place. I am trying to put the cscope_maps.vim in the same place ie
/usr/share/vim/vim70/plugin/cscope_maps.vim. I created the database
by doing cscope ?R. But when I open vim editor I am getting the error
message as ?E568: duplicate cscope database not added?. I tried adding
the contents into ~/.vimrc. I am getting the same error. The line no
that is giving error in the script is ?cs add cscope.out?. I am not
able to find out what is the problem. Can u please help on the same.

In many cases, fine grained interfaces are necessary. One good example is
where we want to bring only a link down. ifconfig can only bring an
interface down which means IP address flush and link down. ip command can
preserve the addresses and just bring the link down.

How do you think that it may be false?

If it is false, there is no way to get the real email address.

What is your real requirement?

What you are going to do with the whois database?

you can create any number of profiles in firefox and start instances under the 
said profile - each behaves independantly. But the profiles must be different.

Is it possible to find the profile used to start a FF window?

You should not use a shell script to do this if you are looking up on
arin.net. If you use `whois` you should read the Terms Of Use where it
is clearly stated that:

"You are not authorized to access or query our Whois 
database through the use of electronic processes that are high-volume
and 
automated except as reasonably necessary to register domain names or 
modify existing registrations;"

I am not quite sure I follow what you described, so, I'll just recommend what 
can be considered the 'standard' way to do this:

a. Always add you personal vim plugins in your '$HOME/.vim/plugins' directory 
rather than the system-wide dir (ie: /usr/share/vim...). Doing this ensures that 
you don't risk losing/overwriting your plugins on an update. Also, it is easier 
to move you personal config/plugins between systems.

b. I personally prefer to comment out the entire 'default' configuration that is 
shipped on Red Hat systems, (ie: /etc/vimrc). On my fedora 12 system, there 
appears to be a cscope specific block. This may be the case for you too, which 
would explain the 'duplicate cscope database' message.

c. The cscope_maps.vim recognizes the $CSCOPE_DB variable, so, I prefer to 
export this after creating/updating the cscope database.

d. Note that since cscope will maintain a reference to the file paths in the 
manner that it receives them (ie: by default, when no other argument is given, 
relative path starting from the current directory), if you need to also move 
between directories, give cscope the complete paths, but collecting the files 
using find and then using the '-i' option.

hmm, all of that was not too clear, so maybe it'll be better if I explain 
through commands rather than words:

$ cp cscope_maps.vim ~/.vim/plugins/

$ rm /etc/vimrc 	# or just comment it all out

$ find `pwd` -type f -name "*.c" \
                 -o -name "*.cc"  \
                 -o -name "*.cpp" \
                 -o -name "*.h" | sort > /tmp/cscope.files

$ cscope -bvq -f my_proj_db.out -i /tmp/cscope.files
# Look up man cscope for details of the options

$ export CSCOPE_DB=my_proj_db.out

$ vim my_proj.c
# Now i can move between any dir and the db references will work just fine


Obviously, I have put the find, cscope and export commands in a script that will 
take a db name and has a central store for all the dbs. I can send that to you 
offline if you want me to.

cheers,
- steve

I don't know how to find the profile but to start two /independent/ firefox 
instances you can use the command:

$ firefox &
$ firefox -no-remote -P [profilename if you know it]

*Please* *do not* use fedora 6. Use a recent version like Fedora 12 (the latest

The problem with using long dead unsupported versions is:
a. You *will* face issues with the software
b. You will not be able to fix the issues because the updates to it are no

/prog/sub1/
/prog/sub1/dir1/
/prog/sub2/

Each folder contains some text files.

I want to search a "text" from all the files in the directory /prog and subdirectories.

I tried
cat * | grep "text"  But it searches only the current directory also it not lists the filename.

How do I do this

Thanks

Write the script to identify the word "Admin" (no case sensitive) and take next sentence for admin contact.
You have to collect the details from all the domains and identify the similarities in the results and write the script to work all the results.

man grep. you may want to check -R and -H flags once again.

You may try perl modules from cpan.org
e.g
http://search.cpan.org/~apla/Net-Domain-Info-0.02/lib/Net/Domain/Info/Whois.pm
http://search.cpan.org/~dhudes/Net-Whois-1.9/Whois.pm

The  -R switch for grep works for you :)

grep -R "search_text" <Directory>

Useless use of CAT :)

Use recursive (-r) option of Grep command:
grep -r "text"  /prog

Bye :)

You could do something like this to get the process id corresponding to
each profile:

	for i in `pidof firefox`; do echo "PID: $i"; lsof -a -p $i | grep
parent | awk '{ print $9 }' | sed -e s/.*firefox\\//''/ -e s/\\/\.*/''/
-e s/[A-Za-z0-9]*\./''/; done

Or you could just install the Profileswitcher Firefox extension ;)

Message-ID: <47d9fe5c1001130240g10245c8bkb5476713bd6b363a@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I was fiddling around with the desktop managers available on Fedora 12, and
I chose GNOME/E16 option from the login screen on my desktop. My family
has a tough time adjusting to it though, so I reverted to GNOME but it still
loads E16 as the window manager in place of the more familiar metacity.

Does anyone know how to revert back to metacity? I have to do this manually
from a virtual terminal for each session, and the other folks don't want to be
 doing that everytime they use the PC :)

Thanks.

Subject: [Ilugc] FTP on the COMMANDLINE
Message-ID: <f4348d691001130304s7903740ev936d5cb3e479dcc8@mail.gmail.com>

The basics of FTP on the command line are simple, you type the
address, login, cd to the directory where the file is you want, and
you type "get <file_name>" and when the file is downloaded you type
"bye" to close the connection.
To show you that the FTP program is running your prompt will change to
a special FTP prompt:

ftp>

Okay, let me show in an example how to download the D Small Linux ISO:
"dsl-1.3.1.iso" using the commandline:

[bruno:~]$ ftp -v ftp.nluug.nl
Connected to ftp.nluug.nl.
220-There are currently 183 users logged in (max 850).
220-There are 50 extra sessions available for IPv6 clients
220-This is an IPv4 session
220-
220-Welcome to the FTP archive of SURFnet BV and
220-The Netherlands Unix Users Group (NLUUG).
220-
220-This server is located in The Netherlands, Europe.
220-If you are abroad, please find an ftp site near you.
220-Most information on this site is mirrored.
220-
220-Information about your login and any transfers you do are logged.
220-If you don't like this, disconnect now.
220-
220-For statistics, see http://ftp.surfnet.nl/.statistics/
220-Problems?  Mail ftpmirror-beheer @ surfnet.nl
220-
220-You may login as "ftp" or "anonymous".
220-
220
530 Please login with USER and PASS.
530 Please login with USER and PASS.
KERBEROS_V4 rejected as an authentication type

Now we are asked to login and we will use the name "anonymous":

Name (ftp.nluug.nl:bruno): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.

And give a password ( in most cases your email address ):

Password:  ********
230-
230-================================================================
230-Want to know where to find what data?  See the file
230-                                        /pub/WhereToFindWhat.txt
230-
230-================================================================
230-
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.

Now we get the FTP prompt and we can cd to the directory where the
file is located: ( Note, next to the cd command also ls and pwd are
commands known by FTP, but more about that later )

ftp>  cd /pub/os/Linux/distr/damnsmall/current/
250 Directory successfully changed.

Next we are going to download the file:

ftp>  get dsl-1.3.1.iso
local: dsl-1.3.1.iso remote: dsl-1.3.1.iso
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for dsl-1.3.1.iso (50745344 bytes).
226 File send OK.
50745344 bytes received in 1.5e+02 seconds (3.3e+02 Kbytes/s)

And after seeing "File send OK" you can close the connection and get
your usual prompt back:

ftp>  bye
221 Goodbye.
[bruno:~]$

If you want to see a full list of commands that your FTP program can
handle just type a ? at the FTP prompt:

ftp>  ?

So I wasn't alone. The Silan card works with ndiswrapper and the
windows driver. legal/foss and such details I am not totally sure.

Thanks for the link. I tried to find the files specified there, but in vain.
None of those methods worked, so I went into XFCE and uninstalled E16.
When I logged back into GNOME the title bars were missing, so I enabled
desktop effects from the terminal using gnome-control-center.
Then I disabled compiz again. All izz well now :)

Can you try after changing the following in grub.conf
'linux /vmlinuz-2.6.27.5-117.fc10.i686 ro
root=UUID=05364295-f61f-4068-b176-f8deb1e52098 rhgb quiet'
to

root=UUID=05364295-f61f-4068-b176-f8deb1e52098 rhgb quiet'

I have the following in my Fedora 11

title Fedora (2.6.29.4-167.fc11.i686.PAE)
        root (hd0,0)
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.29.4-167.fc11.i686.PAE ro

No, undesired results came with mv.
I need to merge several squashfs packages together.
I will unsquashfs them using -d switch to different directories and pack
them together into same common directories.
Suggestions please.

Message-ID: <34d63e2b1001130709x76e78abenf1f957acfff746fb@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Specto

What it is:

Specto is a desktop application that will watch configurable events
(such as website updates, emails, file and folder changes, system
processes, etc) and then trigger notifications.

For example, Specto can watch a website for updates (or a syndication
feed, or an image, etc), and notify you when there is activity
(otherwise, Specto will just stay out of the way). This changes the
way you work, because you can be informed of events instead of having
to look out for them.

Features:

# Freedesktop and HIG-compliant
# Beautifully designed and sits neatly on your workspace
# Integration with GNOME technologies

To Install:

sudo apt-get install specto

To Open:

Applicaiton -> Accessories -> Specto

I dont know how squashfs works, but still let

Chennai does have a freecycle group

Subject: [Ilugc] Tip-of-the-day : Printing to non-postscript printer via smb
Message-ID: <f4348d691001140214n28f234b9me75479aae7bbbf@mail.gmail.com>

 The basic procedure is this: set up two printers:

 1. hpljet3: do magicfilter conversion and send the output to hpljet3-remote
 2. hpljet3-remote: dump whatever it gets to the network printer using smbprint

 Here is the relevant config info and steps: Modify it for your setup

 (should be just a matter of changing lj3 to lj4)

1. Get smbprint from /usr/doc/samba-doc/examples/examples/printing.
   Put somewhere.
   I put mine in /usr/local/etc (can't remember why). Read it and setup

   the config file accordingly.

 2. Add the printcap entries for the virtual printers:

 lp|hplj3:\
        :lp=/dev/null:sd=/var/spool/lpd/hplj3:\
        sh:if=/etc/magicfilter/ljet-filter-remote:rp=raw:

 hplj3-remote:\
        :lp=/dev/null:sd=/var/spool/lpd/hplj3-remote:\
        :sh:pw#80:pl#66:px#1440:mx#0:\
        :if=/usr/local/etc/smbprint:\
        :af=/var/spool/lpd/hplj3-remote/acct:lf=/var/log/lp-errs



 3. Setup the magicfilter scripts:
   in /etc/magicfilter/ljet-filter-remote:

 /etc/magicfilter/ljet3-filter | lpr -Phplj3-remote

 4. Find a Postscript file and test the setup!

Hi

You can do it as follows using fusion-icon, may help

to install fusion-icon as root

yum install fusion-icon

and then launch fusion-icon (or add to gnome startup applications)

and rightclick fusion icon in the panel --> select window manager --> compiz

Used installpkg to install, not from source.
My friend did a fresh install of the whole OS last night with full packages
installed, now mysql is fine, but curious to know the solution otherwise.

Hi,

I hope "dictionary" feature will be more useful and relevant to this
scenario.

This format seems like stored using pickle in perl. One option is to
replace the '=>' with ':' you should be able to read it with python
using pickle. Also you can check if you can change the delemeter from
'=>' to ':' in pickle module.

 AFAIK python has 4 data structures - list, tuple, dictionary and set. 
Obviously 3 of them are of no use - so you can use a dictionary (values in a 
dictionary can also be lists, tuples, sets or dictionaries). btw, if you keep 
top posting, the thread makes no sense at all. Please use properly quoted, 
trimmed, interleaved posting.

You've made a jump there.  What "variable number of meanings"?  You
just had a bunch of strings mapping to numbers.

Why don't you post your code, and point the problem out?

By variable I mean:
 the word "confident' has 8 probable meanings
while "consumers" has only three. So I can't split the file on the basis of
number of lines for each record.

Simplest things will be to just generate that file in a way you can
parse.  JSON is a good format.

Else you'll need to parse it.

In 9.10, it looks like there is no option to change the login screen.
There are some hacks like this:

But I haven't tried it though.

    By adding the line

    hdparm -c3 /dev/hdX

    to a bootup script.

    For SuSE and probably other SYS V based systems
    /sbin/init.d/boot.local works fine.
    This enable 32 bit X-fer for you harddisk. On some systems it boost xfer

If you have not bought anything till now I would recommend BSNL 3G. Their
device, Huawei e156 works like a charm in ubuntu karmic with the latest

I am getting speeds of more that 2.5Mbps in Chennai.

Greetings,

Is anyone in the list aware of any open source dot-matrix downloadable
character set for Indian languages?

I am talking about near native draft printing speed of a dot matrix
printer: if it prints 300cps in self test mode, after downloading the
said fontset, it can print at say 250-270 cps with the user defined
glyphs.

I hope I have made myself clear..

Hi Friends,
I am Kannan from Kongu Engg College,Erode.

In our college most of the departments(Non IT,CSE) using the
proprietary softwares only.So we are plan to customize the Ubuntu OS
in application level.

I need the names of the packages that are related to
Civil,Mechanical,Electronics,Electrical & related to engineering.
Is all packages related to these dept's are present in the Ubuntu
Repository?Because I am taking the Ubuntu for doing this.
If u have any idea,tell ur suggestion guys.....

I have done a custom OS for my college 2 years back as a hobby project named
SSN LINUX OS ;) and distributed it among friends and juniors. ;) LOL
When i had been to FOSSCONF'09 as a Speaker to Thiyagaraja College of Engg,
Madurai came across exactly what you are planning to do, that distro was
called TOSS.
I had a list but couldnt recollect it right now.

About suggestions,

* Select a distro with Long Time Support(LTS)
* Just adding up Applications is not a big deal and wont gain much
appreciation.
* Make sure you give credits to your professors ;) and your College, This
really delights them and reaches better.
* Add up little funny utility, so that while demo you can reveal some easter
eggs ;)
* Make sure you document things and keep it handy, i sometimes forget and
lost few ;)

Try ubuntu education and electronics group (or distro? not sure)

For higher end of course you have scilab. Check out the sheer number
of applications in the scilab library -- I was trying to locate one
package for radiative transfer for one of my friends and voila! almost
there....

KDE education also provides many packages

For basic and advanced physics too there are many packages

There is one for FEA (Finite element analysis - used in structural
science) too of course grid,frame,truss -- 3d and 2d can be treated as
two node elements simplifying the analysis.

R for statistics or PSPP

HTTPS cannot work with named vhosts.  You need a dedicated
IP address or different TCP port numbers for every HTTPS site
you want to host.

This is clearly explained in the apache ssl faq:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ssl/ssl_faq.html#vhosts

I am yet make my purchase but based on recommendations by others
I've decided on BSNL.

The charges are Rs 3,600 for the hardware, Rs 500 activation charge,
Rs 650 monthly for unlimited data transfer.

If you visit the Mount Road BSNL office with ID proof, address proof,
1 photo, and fill up the application form, you can walk away with a
data card within 10 mins.

The network coverage is reported to be as good as with any other
network.


Will be getting one next week.

Location is everything. Consider Reliance vs BSNL based on that.

The speed is not the same in all towers. Make sure the tower near your 
area is upgraded to EVDO, otherwise what you get is EVDO 1x RTT which 
caps out at 144K. I found an older list of towers here 
http://chennai.bsnl.co.in/News/EVDO_BTS.htm , check with the BSNL office 
before committing.

sir, can u plz clarify these part mentioned below "multiple ports (eg:
running ssl)" and how to achieve it and also can u tell me the Maximum
number of name based virtual hosts apache supports?

To use name-based virtual hosting, you must designate the IP address (and
possibly port) on the server that will be accepting requests for the hosts.
This is configured using the
NameVirtualHost<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#namevirtualhost>directive.
In the normal case where any and all IP addresses on the server
should be used, you can use * as the argument to
NameVirtualHost<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#namevirtualhost>.
If you're planning to use multiple ports (e.g. running SSL) you should add a
Port to the argument, such as *:80. Note that mentioning an IP address in a
NameVirtualHost<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#namevirtualhost>directive
does not automatically make the server listen to that IP address.
See Setting which addresses and ports Apache
uses<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/bind.html>for more details. In
addition, any IP address specified here must be
associated with a network interface on the server.

If you want to learn about the integral parts of every distro, i wont
recommend the tools available for remastering.
Rather doing with these tools, extract the iso, squashfs, initrd.img,
modify, create, repack, feel proud learn whats there and work upon :)
With these tools Remastering capabilities are very very very much
restricted.

? ?First of all, some terminology: what is called 'folder' under

Subject: [Ilugc] Tips of the day (Shutdown for non-root users)
Message-ID: <f4348d691001170538j68c23fe9k3267760d6d7e3f6@mail.gmail.com>

Allowing non-root users to shutdown a Linux box.

   1. As root create a group shutdown.
      #addgroup shutdown

   2. Put /sbin/shutdown into the group shutdown.
      #chown root.shutdown /sbin/shutdown

   3. Change accessrights to make /sbin/shutdown setuid and disallow
      other users from executing shutdown.
      #chmod 4754 /sbin/shutdown

   4. Make a link from /bin/shutdown to /sbin/shutdown
   #ln -s /sbin/shutdown  /bin/shutdown

   Now anyone belonging to the group shutdown can execute shutdown
but I just will
   allow the person in control of the keyboard to be able to issue the shutdown
   command. You might prefer something else.

   For the following to work you need to have "shadow password" installed but I
   believe most have it.

   5. Edit the file login.defs. Near the end of this file locate the line
   #CONSOLE_GROUPS       floppy:audio:cdrom
   Remove the hashsign and add the group shutdown to this line and you get:
   CONSOLE_GROUPS        floppy:audio:cdrom:shutdown

   Thats it. Everyone logged in via the console will belong to these groups so
   you need not add anyone to them. I believe this is better than to just add
   users to the group shutdown.

All,

I like to reduce the kernel size and boot fast (may be 5-10 Mb kernel size) & boots up in 15 seconds.

I measured, in the current default installation (FC10) the bootup time is around 45seconds and size is 50mb.

I did compiling and removed the unnecessary hardware modules. Still I am seeling slight changes. May be I have removed the little.

Anyone have experience in this kernel optimization. Please share your experience.

Thanks
Suresh

Boot is one criteria i log, measure and tweak using

You can get kernels as small as 400KB with minimal modules. See
http://leaf.sourceforge.net/ as an example. These boot up quick.

AFAIK you do dont need a dedicated IP address - I have successfully mixed http 
and https on one apache - the only difference is that the http listens on 80 
and the https listens on 443 (btw, I would have failed the interview)

What you describing is different from the issue being discussed. This
query is specific to hosting *multiple* HTTPS sites using vhosts.

It's a chicken/egg issue -- apache needs to read the HTTP headers
to figure out which vhost SSL cert it should use, but since the HTTP
request itself is SSL encrypted apache cannot read the headers
without the SSL cert.

Only work around is to use different IP/port numbers so this problem
can be resolved.  All shared hosting providers therefore require you
to purchase a dedicated IP address if you want HTTPS.

possible true - I have only one https along with a bunch of http virtual 
sites. the https listens on 443 - so if I add another one on 443 would it 
work?

i think you should read the link below (which raja already given here)
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ssl/ssl_faq.html#vhosts

i would like to know how shared SSL works - a single SSL being shared across
host right?

Hello, everyone,

It annoys me greatly for Firefox to display that Update Extensions
screen when all I want to do is get on the web and check my email. Is it
possible for me to disable this and have it simply update in the
background after I start (I know this is possible because this is how it
functions if you manually click the update button).

I'm using Firefox 3.0 on Ubuntu 9.04

Thanks for reading,

Well, i don't have access to a system with Firefox 3.0 but on FF 3.5 I see an 
option in "Edit->Preferences->Advanced->Update" (a check-box that selects 
'Installed Add-ons"

Or you could type about:config in your location bar and search for 
"extensions.update.enabled" or "extensions.update.notifyUser" and set them 
according to your preference.

cheers,

Controlling login abilities

If you want the user to have full telnet/ftp/etc access, use a real shell in
/etc/passwd (as in /bin/bash)

Non-login access can be set by using /bin/true (because /bin/true is
in /etc/shells)

No login and no FTP access by setting the shell as /bin/false
(because /bin/false is not in /etc/shells)

(note of the maintainer : in the latest case, the user can still have by
example POP3 access if there is a POP3 daemon, or access to other services
not doing a check of the user's shell)

Thanks for the help, Steve. I did as you instructed, but the first
solution does not check for updates any more, the second solution seems
to be the same as the first, and the third doesn't seem to automatically
upgrade in the background. I guess that feature doesn't exist, eh?

Oh well, atleast I can get rid of the notification screen thanks to you.

We are having mini-projects this semester, I like to take this opportunity to makeas?many students as possible to do open source projects.
Please suggest _simple_ projects.
There are students who were completely new to this platform and also they donthave much Idea about any other, grown by `copy && paste` source code given bythe lecturers.
As far now I suggested Tamil translation for one student, till now there are many students who were not yet decided what project they are going to do.

Many of them want the softwares by defaultly.
They don't want to spend 20 Gb space for setup the local repository. That's
only we are planned for doing this.

Dear Kannan, you are confused (if im not ;) ), You don't need to setup the
local repository on every machine to install those packages, repository is
something available to access for others to update or install any new
packages. You can access the repository source and it will list out all the
applications available, you can select required ones and install.

Controlling login abilities should means controlling the user accounts.

To restrict a user from logging in, LOCK it

passwd -l <username>

It will still show Login incorrect ;)

to unlock it,

passwd -u <username>

Please provide a RELEVANT Subject / Title.

Subject: [Ilugc] Announce: Linux Desktop Testing Project (LDTP) 2.0.1
	released
Message-ID: <9d0602eb1001182059p3c0ead35rae31dcab2e668ac3@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

LDTPv2 a complete rewrite of LDTPv1 in Python. This release is dedicated to
Eitan Isaacson[1]. Eitan wrote the LDTPv2 framework and important API's in
LDTPv2 !

My co-workers in VMware Ranjith Murugan, Gaurav Sharma and Anupa Kamath, did
a wonderful job in verifying the compatibility of LDTPv1 and v2. Special
thanks to them and my manager Greg McShea on supporting this effort.

Special thanks to Ara Pulido[2] for tracking the LDTPv2 status and pushing
us to make the release at the earliest, as Ara wants to include LDTPv2 in
Ubuntu Lucid, before feature freeze.

Following are the difference between LDTPv1 and v2:

* getlabel function is deprecated - you can use getobjectproperty('winodw',
'objectname', 'label') # To verify the display text
* Label in v2 doesn't return the accelerator key (eg: in v1 "_Find" will be
returned on v2 just "Find" is returned)
* Strict data types are checked, in v1 most of the inputs are considered as
string, if not they will be converted to string, but on v2 exception will be
thrown, if incorrect type is passed to any function * In v1 we have ldtp
binary, on v2 we need to check ldtpd.sh for now, this doesn't return the
version for now, it has to be implemented, if you check for "ldtp --version"
in v1
* In v1 each action command was given 1 second sleep time internally before
execution, but on v2 there is no delay unless its set in environment
variable LDTP_COMMAND_DELAY. So, the script has to use appropriate wait time
* As Javier (from Ubuntu QA team) found, launchapp, argument name changed
from 'arg' to 'args'

Some of missing API in v2:

* Calendar object
* logFailures in v1 is not implemented in v2
* LDTP logging methods
* appundertest
* launchapp2
* blackoutregion
* label object
* panel object
* ProcessStatistics

LTFX is completely removed in LDTP v2 in favor of wnck implmentation

Download LDTPv2 source from
http://download.freedesktop.org/ldtp/2.x/2.0.x/ldtp2-2.0.1.tar.gz

New dependency:

python-twisted-web
python-pyatspi
python-gtk

Will schedule binary package building for different Linux distribution using
openSUSE Build Service -

It is alright to have minimal or no experience in Perl and you can learn in

Yea, logging in single user mode is much easier. We will need to handle the
shadow and passwd files only if we need to bruteforce the root password to
find out what it earlier was :) which i presume only a cracker would need :)

But this will not work in debian. Allowing single user root access unprotected in grub is an invitation to security nightmare.

Might be a better idea to use a remote desktop connection.

Although there is openssh available for windows using Cygwin[1], like someone 
else suggested, you should consider installing rdesktop on linux and enabling 
remote desktop login on your windows system. There is yet another option -- 
install a VNC server on windows and then you can access your windows systems 
either through a browser or using a vnc client on linux.

In any case openssh is a limiting option unless you are scripting something 
and/or all the windows tasks that you want to execute are command line tasks.

hth,

Well, I cant believe this is still left unsolved. So, here is a (tried and 
tested) suggestion. How about using the -u option of the cp command? Like this,

cp -r dir1/* dirnew
cp -r -u dir2/* dirnew

If the * expansion dies because of the number of files, then you may have to 
write a short script with the same logic.

Hi,

Books are better than CBT to learn a language.

:-)

But still some videos are available at

Message-ID: <616533194.36391263911527726.JavaMail.root@127.0.0.1>

Dear All
the expected output is an image of vertical rectangular thin strip ( like commercial barcode)  within the stipulated rectangular boundary using php script with "gd" library on Ubuntu 9.04.  I am able to achieve this partially as the script counts & creates "PNG" images partially from the input text file containing characters i.e. A, G, C, T,........   Instead of counting and drawing image for 800 characters, it does its job only for about 150 characters. The sample input & php script file is attached with this mail. kindly input your valuable suggestions & recommendations through this forum.

Dear Friends,

We organized a Workshop on Scientific Computing with Python from 11-12 Jan 2010 and FOSSEE Team, Led by Mr.Asokan Pichai, FOSSEE Consultant and three Research Associates-Shantanu, Puneeth & Nishanth conducted all the sessions.

43 students and staff got benefitted, covering 8 engg. departments and three colleges. Could not invite more faculty from other colleges in time. No registration fee was collected from participants. The FOSSEE team provided all participants with LivePython DVD's. 
http://fossee.in

The good thing about FOSSEE Team is that they have put even negative comments also in their workshop reports which is highly appreciable.

Thanks to one of the ilugc members query which prompted me to come in touch with Mr. Asokan and this workshop was the result of it.

Best wishes to AVIT Foss Team who have also called FOSSEE Team to conduct the same workshop. My only advice to them is that the fee for Industry participants could be reduced.

With regards,
Benedict J. Nicholas

Message-ID: <f4348d691001190659q5ae9cf43x67da9fa3d59261ac@mail.gmail.com>

Looking for an easier way to find files than the find command? Try
using locate. In contrast to find's complexity, locate is the ultimate
in simplicity. The command:

locate <string>

searches an internal database and prints the pathnames of all files
and directories that contain the given string in their names. You can
narrow down the search by piping the output to grep. For example, the
following finds all files containing the string "kde" that are in bin
directories:

locate kde | grep bin

The strings don't have to be complete names; they can be partial
strings, such as "gno" instead of spelling out "gnome". The -r option
lets you use a regular expression (in quotes):

locate -r 'gno*'

One thing to be aware of is that locate is case-sensitive: Searching
for HOWTO and for howto will give you different results.

Rather than searching the disk each time, as find does, locate depends
on the creation and maintenance of a database. Because it only has to
search the database, not the disk, locate is faster than find. On the
other hand, the results are only as current as the database.

The locate database is generally updated daily by a cron job, but you
can update it manually by running the command updatedb (usually as
root). If you are adding new applications or deleting old files and
you don't want to wait for the next day to have an up-to-date
database, you might want to run it manually.

Hi,

How do i know the current driver modules used in my system.
i found in some article, the running module details are located in  /sys/class directory. but how do i collect all the module info. This is required for the kernel optimization.
Any scripts available?
Thanks for your help.

If I got your question right,

lsmod

It seems to be in a package called
module-init-tools in Archlinux

I think you are looking for this,

# lsmod | awk '{print $1;}' | while read MODULE; do modinfo "${MODULE}"; 
echo; done | less

I think You are using squid version 2.6 or later, if so the phrase
"transparent" itself enough.
(It is clearly stated in the given URL).

If you are using prior 2.6 version , it may be the reason ,see there are
some sapces between h & ttpd_accel_host virtual in your configuration file.

you missed the phrase "port" after --to  (It is also in the same URL)

Squid has released version 3, It is recommended that use the newer version

I guess, having a look at the previous reply will take less time than
pointing out the mistake OFTEN.
Sometimes the content matters than the format, No one does this
deliberately. Please try to understand.
Even still if you cant stop. Please send a similar mail as a weekly digest

You never respect people who correct others ? No one is paying him to
take pains in correcting people and getting them become a better
communicator. Format *does* matter (How often have your teachers at
school/university told you to present properly, corrected you? You
mock at them for not ignoring your contents?)

lsmod alone may not give the complete info. Because many modules may
be compiled into the kernel. So you check the kernel's .config file
also.

I want to customize the kernel to support only my PC hardware drivers. I don't want the kernel to support all the hardware drivers. The intention is reduce the size of the kernel. For this I need to know what is my current hardware driver module details to configure the kernel.
Thanks to all.

ILUGC mails are archived and publically available. So formatting is
very very important. Otherwise, it will be difficult for a non-list
member to know, who actully send that mail.

+1


Posting poorly formatted email waste huge amounts of time.

It costs the sender at most 1 minute to format his/her post correctly.
This mailing list has more than 1000 subscribers, and if it takes 1
minute extra to read a poorly formatted email, that's 1000 minutes
you're wasting of someone else's time.

To the OP, please be considerate and make your posts easy for
others to read.  In short, just follow the list guidelines.

I generally do not get involved in this kind of discussion but I think 
some of the newer members are simply not bothering to read the posting 
(formatting in this case) guidelines and  follow them.

[1] The point of interleaved posting: the reader should be able to 
understand the context of what was said and the response to it without 
having to sieve through the entire thread and figure it out.  Imagine 
every member expending that kind of time!

> Sometimes the content matters than the format, No one does this
> deliberately. Please try to understand.

Content and format *both* matter.  Agreed, it may not be deliberate but 
the author must talk the language that his/her audience understands 
otherwise many put him/her in the "kill/trash" filter see [1].

> Even still if you cant stop. Please send a similar mail as a weekly
>  digest ;)

The tragedy is that members keep repeating the same mistake or choose to 
ignore guidelines even after being told.  After some time people start 
ignoring posts from such individuals.

You need a secure shell **server** (aka daemon in the *nix world) 
running as a service on windows machine.  There are a couple of products 
available but they are commercial or resort to Windows Remote desktop as 
others have suggested.

Message-ID: <e6b5008a1001200907u3bc37d8ahe9ba0f949f8b2a55@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Conky has been transferring 1 to 1.5 kbps (up and down) over my internet (my
router's internet LED blinks) connection though it isn't supposed to do so.
This is shown in its own upspeed and downspeed graphs and in GNOME system
monitor.

When i kill conky, this doesn't happen. System Monitor validates this too.
Since I have a 1.5 GB monthly limit and since I leave my connection on for
long periods of time, this is not really good for me.

My .conkyrc file: http://pastebin.com/m63194053

Why is this happening?
Is there a workaround/patch?

Not sure about the exact cause but you can try replacing rhost with
rip. Probably conky is doing host name check up for remote hosts. It
might be causing the bandwidth usage. Though it shouldn't be really
doing it if there are no remote connections.

You could also run tcpdump/wireshark to capture packets and find out
what is causing the network usage.

Message-ID: <a8e2ecc11001201558v72361171o8cb9cf5fa9113b74@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

How can we access a password protected site using perl. Not the ones' that
use a realm (wherein there is a popup window for username and password) type
of authentication. By password protected I mean sites like gmail, yahoo etc,
wherein the password needs to be supplied to the ID of field. I have tried
using the LWP module POST method, however, GMAIL does not accept post
method.

Regards,
Ashish


PS: Actually now I am unable to even access pages that use a realm for
authentication, I was going through a very informative page in CPAN
documentation, however am unable to find it. Further, I am not even able to
rewrite the code to access those type of pages.


#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use LWP::UserAgent;
use HTTP::Request::Common qw(POST);
use HTTP::Request::Common qw(GET);
use HTTP::Cookies;
use LWP::Simple;
use Net::SSLeay;

$ua->proxy(http => 'http://myproxy.net');
$ua->cookie_jar(  HTTP::Cookies->new( file => 'mycookies.txt', autosave => 1
)  );
######### $ua->credentials('172.25.203.131/isos/', 'This_is_a_realm',
'ashish', 'password')  ##### What does this (credentials) do. Isn't
mentioning this supposed to make the scenario 2 below work?

1. my $req = GET 'http://172.25.203.131/isos/';                  # This
works
2. my $req = GET 'http://172.25.203.131/isos/';                  # This
doesn't works if "isos" is password protected.
3. my $req = POST 'http://172.25.203.131/isos/'  [username => 'ashish',
password => 'password'] ;                 # This doesn't works  The
"informative page" I have mentioned above had an explanation as to how to
make the above POST request to work with some reasons. I can't find that
now.

my $res = $ua->request($req, 'test.html');

exit 0;

There is a perl programme called fetchyahoo. This gets yahoo mails to local mail folder so that mutt and other such things can access. This can throw light on how to authenticate. fetchyahoo is part of debian repository. There are similar tools for gmail,hotmail etc.

Dear luggies
I made a half-an-hour presentation 'Introduction to FOSS' at Dhanalakshmi Srinivasan College of Engg and Tech at Mamallapuram.

On behalf of ILUGC I thank the management, faculties and students for the opportunity.
My special thanks to Ranjith Kumar who is our member.

From: Gavin Treadgold

This is a brief request from the Sahana Software Foundation to fellow
GSOC mentors and their projects. We have already approached some
communities with requests for assistance, and I thought I'd ask here.

We are looking for additional developers to help us with Sahana and
continue to build an information portal that is seeing increased
interest and usage to assist organisations responding to events in
Haiti.

Sahana Haiti Reponse Overview page + areas we're working on
<http://wiki.sahana.lk/doku.php/haiti:start>

Skills we are primarily looking for:
 (you don't need them all, any will do)

* Python - the main development for SahanaPy is Python 
  (we're not using PHP for this instance)
* web2py - we use the web2py enterprise framework for SahanaPy 
  (I'm told it is fairly easy to learn if you're used to Django)
* OpenLayers
* jQuery

Best place is to jump onto #sahana on freenode if you're interested in
giving us a hand or finding out more. As much or as little as you
want. Some of our core devs have been working really long hours the
past 5-6 days, and any additional resource would assist us greatly,
particularly as we're really starting to get some interest, traction
and coverage. And more feature requests.

If you read this far, thanks for taking the brief time required to
read this - hope some of you are able to join us on #sahana and help
out in whatever way possible ;)

never ask to ask - just ask. It is possible that someone may be able to

LJ Tech Tip: Dereference Variable Names Inside Bash Functions 

If we pass variable names as parameters to functions, they will be
treated as string literals and cannot be dereferenced (ie the value is
not available).  But this is not so, variable names can be passed as
parameters to functions and they can be dereferenced to obtain the
value of the variable with the given name.

The following script demonstrates this:

DerefernceVariablePassedToFunction() {
  if [ -n "$1" ] ; then
     echo "value of [${1}] is: [${!1}]"
  else
     echo "Null parameter passed to this function"
  fi
}

Variable="LinuxJournal"
DerefernceVariablePassedToFunction Variable

The secret here is the "!" used in the variable expansion "${!1}".  
"If the first character of parameter is an exclamation point, a level
of variable indirection is introduced. Bash uses the value of the
variable formed from the rest of parameter as the name of the
variable; this variable is then expanded and that value is used in the
rest of the substitution, rather than the value of parameter itself.
This is known as indirect expansion"

Super Gamer (www.supergamer.org, 8GB of Linux Only Games) created a
bootable, dual-layer DVD full of native-running Linux games. Check out
the impressive list of preinstalled games you'll get when you download
the ISO.

NOTE: If any one in Chennai downloaded this SuperGamer ISO, Plz share.

     ^^^^^^^^^^^ -- looks like you are missing the qt-devel rpm. Did you install 
all the dependencies mentioned here ?

http://www.stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Build_Dependencies

(scroll down on that page and try the yum command to install all required 
packages on Fedora 10, that should work for RHEL too, if some packages are 
missing you might want to add the EPEL repo to your system (more of that below))

Since stellarium already exists in Fedora, you could try rebuilding the Fedora 
11/12 rpm:

https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/packages/name/stellarium

$ rpmbuild --rebuild <stellarium>.src.rpm

and install that. Or you could request the inclusion of stellarium in the EPEL repo:

Looks like you are missing your Qt dev environment or
at least qmake is not in your path.

Have you satisfied these build dependencies?

http://www.stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Build_Dependencies


> I am using RHEL5 in my laptop

You may want to consider adding 3rd party repositories to
yum.  You can then yum install binary rpms without going
through the trouble of compiling packages.  Here's a list
of 3rd party repositories:

http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories


Btw, distros like Fedora/Debian/Ubuntu offer a huge list
of rpm/deb packages which you can easily install.  So RHEL
is better suited for servers than laptops/desktops.

But i mentioned "Sometimes" not always, please re-read my previous reply, it

Nice find Mr. Bharathi. Most often we end up getting an error when tryin to
play windows games on Linux with WINE.
Possibly will get it downloaded in a couple of days. Once done will let you

Thanks in advance,

One can use a -i switch to make the search case insensitive.

e.g

locate -i sOmEthinG

or

Hi,
      I have come across something similar, in my Nokia mobile, where in the
music player i have an option called "Play music via BlueTooth".
I also tried this once i got my Nokia mobile few months back. AFAIK i didnt
find any such option in gnokii.
May be try latest versions of gnokii or gammu and let us know :)

Subject: [Ilugc] Sound does work in Ubuntu 9.10 on boot until manually
	reloading alsa
Message-ID: <4B594F32.6020501@gmail.com>

Hi all,
I use Ubuntu 9.10 on my HP Pavilion dv9704tx laptop and I have been
facing an issue with alsa. Everytime I start the computer, the audio
doesn't work but when I manually force-reload alsa, the volume control
gets muted and on raising the volume, the audio works.With some help on
ubuntuforums(http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8704925), I found
that this issue could be an issue when there are multiple alsa devices
and the order gets mixed up. When I did a aplay -l,
I get this

<snip>
guru@guru-laptop:/etc/init.d$ aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: ALC268 Analog [ALC268 Analog]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 6: Si3054 Modem [Si3054 Modem]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
guru@guru-laptop:/etc/init.d$ arecord -l

</snip>

Does this mean this is an issue due to multiple alsa devices and their
ordering? And is it correct to have the same card number 0 for sound
device and modem?

Regards,
Guruprasad

Firstly, please do not top post. It does not aid in figuring out the context. 
Secondly, please avoid html mails. Thirdly, please describe your problem with 
more details.

 From the information provided till now, I am confused whether you are facing 
problems building stellarium or launching it. I assume that the reference to the 
script to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH is related to the instructions at the bottom of 
this page:

http://www.stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Build_Dependencies

is that correct ? If it is, please let us know:
a. Did you manage to build stellarim ?
b. If not what are the error messages you get ?
c. If yes, what is the problem with launching stellarium ? what are the error 
messages you get ?
d. Did you try any of the alternative I mentioned (ie: re-building the fedora 
RPM) ? If not, is there a reason why you do not want to try that ?

cheers,
- steve

Yes, i encountered the same problem few months back. The following command
works for you :) , and it configures also alsamixer so no need of manual
work.

 alsasound start

In my case the following command did the work,

 /usr/local/etc/init.d/alsasound start

And add this to the start-up script so your sound will work fine every boot
:)

for x in range(0,1000,100):
    sm = am.crop((x,0,x+100,100))
    ym = im.paste(sm,(0,x,100,x+100))
im.show()

I'm sure perl guys can do it in one line ;-)

Hi, I want to merge some avi files... these files may be mkv format too.
Files amounts are 3 to 10. One of my friend suggested cinerella for this
merging. But, are there any program under ubuntu or fedora to merge various
video files? I mean, cinerella is much more heavy program for this small
task.

Hi,

mencoder, ffmpeg, avimerge(transcode), pitivi

these tools can do the merging.

But, dont know about merging various file formats.

I think you have to bring them all to a single format and do a merge.

try there tools and update us with your results.

I think it involves two steps,

1. convert those different formats to a single format(may be mp4?)
2. merge them( I would say 'cat' can do this job very well).

Thanks,

Yes, no need to use something as heavy as cinelerra.

mkv is a container format. You can have multiple audio and video streams and
also subtitles in the same file. But what do you really mean by merging?

It is rather meaningless to play one video with a different audio or
mix two videos
 unless you are doing something advanced.

This mencoder command line can merge two video files.

$ mencoder video1.mpg video2.mpg -o merged.mpg -oac lavc -ovc lavc

But for merging to work the codec parameters have to match accurately, like
bitrates, aspect ratios, everything.

I have not worked with avimerge or devede.

You could try them as well. ffmpeg can also help.

Message-ID: <34d63e2b1001231926i4ea316cco891e77fea412755f@mail.gmail.com>

Application: khtml2png

What it is:

khtml2png is a helpful tool for capturing an image of a webpage with
ease. It's nice to use because it will get the entire length of the
site, no matter whether it is fully visible in the browser.

Features:

it sure beats shell scripting Firefox to open on a different display
and capturing an image with Imagemagick, which is a royal pain in the
butt. I embed this application in PHP scripts to create web design
roundups over at my other blog. I was able to capture 75 minimal web
designs without much hassle.

To install:

http://nchc.dl.sourceforge.net/project/khtml2png/khtml2png2/2.7.6/khtml2png-2.7.6.tar.gz

You can use it to take a screenshot with a command like the following:


/usr/bin/khtml2png2 --display  --width 1024 --height 768

Message-ID: <34d63e2b1001241650g4002e7aej20af425be31b27bc@mail.gmail.com>

Application: Kismet

What it is:

Kismet is an 802.11 layer2 wireless network detector, sniffer, and
intrusion detection system. Kismet will work with any wireless card
which supports raw monitoring (rfmon) mode, and (with appropriate
hardware) can sniff 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, and 802.11n traffic.
Kismet also supports plugins which allow sniffing other media such as
DECT.

Kismet identifies networks by passively collecting packets and
detecting standard named networks, detecting (and given time,
decloaking) hidden networks, and infering the presence of nonbeaconing
networks via data traffic.

Features:

802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11a, 802.11n sniffing
Standard PCAP file logging (Wireshark, Tcpdump, etc)
Client/Server modular architecture
Multi-card and channel hopping support
Runtime WEP decoding
Tun/Tap virtual network interface drivers for realtime export of packets
Hidden SSID decloaking
Distributed remote sniffing with Kismet drones
XML logging for integration with other tools

Why? ImageMagick is heavy and complex but

$ import foo.png

will do the job of course.

Umbrello will be far better, we used it for the Case Tools Lab. It supports
a lot of languages like Python, PHP, etc.

hello
Sorry, but i am expecting the solution to be in php with gd. I have modified the php script to enable it to deliver the desired output but, it still outputs the syntax error.

just to experiment - cut a 1000 by 100 image into 10 and pasted in a fresh 
image 100 by 1000
#!/usr/bin/python
from PIL import Image
#create image in red 1000x100
am = Image.new('RGB',(1000,100),'red')

#slice first image and paste into second
for x in range(0,1000,100):
    sm = am.crop((x,0,x+100,100))
    ym = im.paste(sm,(0,x,100,x+100))
im.show()
I'm sure perl guys can do it in one line ;-)

If a person really wants to penetrate, To remove password of the grub, all
he has to do is boot a live CD and remove the line containing the password
in menu.lst file. To avoid this attack also, the filesystem would have to be
encrypted which is a large overhead.

Message-ID: <a8e2ecc11001242300t13701b92k60a715187da14336@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to assign values to variable names stored in an array, however
it is not working below is the code. Please see the highlighted text.

Trying to achieve the following:

If user has stored his options in a file, then the code should open that
file, pick the values and assign them to variable names stored in the array
@vrvariables.
*Basically the variables should get assigned from either user input, or from
a stored file.*

CODE


my @myvariables = ('url','realm','username','password','proxy','cookies');
*my @vrvariables =
('$url','$realm','$username','$password','$proxy','$cookies'); # THESE ARE
THE STORED VARIABLE NAMES*
my $varcount = @myvariables;
my $ac = 0;
my $store_file = 'files-dash/cds.html';
sub grab_input
{
        print "Store choice made (Y/N): "; chomp(my $choice = <STDIN>);
        print "URL to access          : "; chomp(my $url = <STDIN>);
chomp(my $url_credentials = `echo $url | cut -d "/" -f3`);
        print "Realm (If required)    : "; chomp(my $realm = <STDIN>);
        print "Username (If required) : "; chomp(my $username = <STDIN>);
        system(`stty -echo`);
        print "Password               : "; chomp(my $password = <STDIN>);
        system(`stty echo`);
        print "\n";
        print "Proxy server           : "; chomp(my $proxy = <STDIN>);
        print "Cookies File to use    : "; chomp(my $cookies = <STDIN>);
        if($choice eq "Y" || "y")
        {
        my %credentials_store = ( url => $url, realm => $realm, username =>
$username, password => $password, proxy => $proxy, cookies => $cookies );
        open(STORE, ">store.txt");
        my $i = 0;
        foreach(%credentials_store)
                {
                        while ($i < $varcount)
                                {
                                        print STORE

                                        $i++;

        my $i = 0;
        while ($stored_var = <MKGLB>)
                                {
*                                        "$vrvariables[$i]" = $stored_var;
#THIS IS NOT WORKING
*                                        $i++;

Something wrong in the above line.

Why would you want to do

$vrvariable[0] = '$url';

$vrvariable[1] = '$realm';

Can't you find a better way?

Anyway see below.

You can replace all <STDIN> with <>.

Default is that. ;)

Is the above code printing correctly?

You did not mention that.

You could use File::Copy module instead.

This is a weird way to assign variables from a file.

Do you want to store each variable in a line?

Have you tried

$ cat temp.txt

and found out what it contains?

I think you are not using the perl idioms correctly. Perl eases program
development in a big way though the advanced skills come only with
experience.

But overall there are many simple ways to achieve complex tasks in perl.

Hi Rajkumar,
                      In Linux, i-node numbers represents link to physical
locations (AFAIK). Unless you necessarily require a physical location i-node
numbers don't change or its not needed (in case of moving files inode
numbers do not change).

If u need to change a file's i-node number, trick is to copy and paste it
into the same location with a new name and remove the original file and
rename the new file back to original one.
Now check the new i-node number with the command ls -i.

What are you trying to do?
whats your current status on this issue?

Please make your question more elaborate.
Already Mr. Shrinivasan pointed that. Explain better so you get desired
solutions.

Message-ID: <20100125083103.739F11DB271@www.ae.iitm.ac.in>

Dear All,

Myself conducted a half-day FOSS seminar in Arul Anandar College (Autononous), Karumathur (Near Madurai) for the 1st and 2nd year MCA students.  After the programme, I came to understand that, the management wants to use F/OSS throughout the institution replacing proprietary softwares.

The also have decided to conduct a two-day faculty development programme in FOSS in the next academic year.

I have demonstrated Fedora-12 installation and provided free DVDs to them.

Sorry.I am doing final year project and the full  paper can downloaded from
this link
*
http://www.ziddu.com/download/8316219/tybyIntegratingSteganographyTechniqueinLinuxKernel.doc.html
*

base paper for our project:
*
http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F4910763%2F4925076%2F04925089.pdf%3Farnumber%3D4925089&authDecision=-203
*


The Concept of the project is that  we are developing a file security system
with biometric authentication and  using stenography to hide the file
information.But  instead of hiding the whole file information into image or
any stenography technique .we are just hiding the file's  inode structure
details such as block number,inode no etc,. which will be  fast and
efficient approach instead of hiding the entire file

*Details of  Project:*

   - OS used is Fedora core 6.0 Linux
   - File security with Biometric finger print reader authentication
   - Front using java which used as a file manager

Hi All,

I have prepared the attached file to get web pages protected by realm
password. I am in process of automating some of browser work in office, as I
learn perl.

It may be useful for some. will send the completed file later.

@Girish.. Since I am still learning and since this is virtually my first
useful perl script. I found it hard to make changes to what was already
written. But as I proceed, will develop on that..

Thanks for your help.

Regards,
Ashish

If you are in the Java world, there are lots of UML Plugins available
in Eclipse. I have also used Jude (Community edition) extensively for

Application: Krecipes

What it is :

Krecipes is a new Open Source project for an exciting world that is
almost forgotten in the Tux world: COOKING

Features:

    *  Can manage a recipe database with an easy to use interface
    * Allows creation/removal of new ingredients and units
    * Helps with diets, calculating amount of calories, vitamines,
carbohydrates... per recipe
    * Creates shopping lists, and daily suggestions for a given diet type
    * Is based on MySQL (1) so it could be possible to generate a KSN(2)
    * Should be as flexible as possible to have the possibility to
extend it in future.

To know more about:

http://krecipes.sourceforge.net/?p=about

To install:

sudo apt-get install krecipes

I assume that you have your source tree in  /usr/src/linux-x.y.z/ (Or use
your path ).

$ cd /usr/src/linux-x.y.z/

$ bzip2 -dc ../x.y.z-mm2.bz2 | patch -p1

The -dc option asks bzip2 to uncompress the specified files to standard
output. This is piped to the patch utility, which applies changes to each
modified file in the code tree.

Hi ,

Your requirement  is not clear for me . I assume that you are using old
kernel version with Fedora Core 6, now you want the latest one. If this is
your requirement, You can  upgrade kernel without compiling from source
code.  Here is the doc about linux-kernel-upgrade-howto .

http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-kernel-upgrade-howto/

If you need compile the kernel for learning purpose or specific task such as
embedded system. I request you to  search around the internet you have lot
of doc about Linux Kernel compilation.

Thanks & Rg

Is there any specific reason for using Fedora Core 6?, If you dont have any specific reasons upgrading to the latest version Fedora 12 will solve your driver problem.

Hi ,

I think upgrading kernel will not help you( but I am not sure) . Please wait
some one will replay you .   I will give you one solution for your problem,
If you will not  get any solution from someone else then finally try with
NdisWrapper.

NdisWrapper is a piece of code to interface between non-linux drivers (
windoze drivers ) and linux. Basically, you run the windoze driver, through
Ndiswrapper, instead of a native linux driver. It was written to broaden the
number of wireless cards that work with linux. A lot of card makers do not
take the time to write linux drivers.In some cases it is the only way to get
some cards to work under linux.

Read the link :

http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/ndiswrapper/index.php?title=Main_Page

Why don't you try removing those lines which are indicated in error message?
May be you should start with
http://www.burntomlette.in/index.php?title=Squid [1] which has a  small
configuration file compared to yours.

[1] The wiki link is being spammed constantly, so feel free to check the

Do you have the kernel-devel and kernel-headers rpms installed ?

Here is a nice howto about creating custom kernels for Fedora, the steps should 
apply for RHEL kernels too:

aim using ubuntu 9.10 asus k8v-mx all drivers are working but vga is
not working the driver is VIA Technologies, Inc. K8M800/K8N800/K8N800A
[S3 UniChrome Pro] (rev 01)

iam the driver in mother board cd in tar file i don't how install in
symteic manager the driver installed is X.Org X server -- VIA display
driver

Open Chrome is a project for the development of free and open-source drivers
for the VIA UniChrome video chipsets.

Originally called the 'snapshot' release, since it was a snapshot of an
experimental branch of the unichrome cvs code, this is a continued development
of the open source unichrome driver (from http://unichrome.sf.net) which
also incorporates support for the unichrome-pro chipsets.

Support for hardware acceleration (XvMC) for all chipsets has subsequently
been ripped out of the unichrome.sf.net driver. Therefore your only option if
you wish to make use of the acceleration features of your VIA chip with free
and open-source drivers is to use this version of the driver.

Canonical provides critical updates for xserver-xorg-video-openchrome
until April 2011.

Distro? Did you get any error message in console?

Try this in super user mode:

If you are not root or have permissions to reconfigure the system, the
same would happen. Try launching the networking applet with sudo.

Hi Steve,

This is not the way to answer.

i bet you, every gsoc students asked the same question on the first day.

"What is" is the first step to reach anything.

If you dont know to explain, please be polite.
someone will answer.

Please dont discourage the budding experts.

Thanks.

I did not discourage. What I asserted was correct. If the OP needs to post to a 
mailing list and wait for an answer, he/she has not yet mastered the beautiful 
art of the google. Which in turn implies that he/she has a long way to go before 
worrying about the relevance of GSoC to his/her life.

That's all that i said.

While it is good to be polite at times, utter laziness (which is what the OP 
displayed) is not something to be rewarded with polite replies. This is not some 
school for the betterment of retarded induhviduals ! If one has mastered the 
skills required to subscribe to a mailing list and send out a mail, then the 
only explanation for the behavior of the OP was laziness.

Ignoring that and feeding the OP the answer to the question just rewards this 
behavior.

cheers,
- steve

Hi,

> ? ? ? ? How to kill X System and start X again whilst being inside X.
Assuming you are ok with losing that active session and logging in
again, you could try ctrl+alt+bksp. Or restart the login manager as
super user. /etc/init.d/gdm restart in many cases.

Oh well i knew that(i must have elaborated before), anyways thanks Abishek.

I write a script to kill the existing X and start it again with some
different parameter, the problem is that if i run that script from X, it
will kill X first and once this happens, the child(my script) also gets
killed and thus X fails to start again.
How to i solve this issue?

How to make my script run above X ie. no way related to X as a child
process.

Hey everyone,

It would be awesome if people could help circulate news about iPad's
dangerous DRM scheme on the popular sites writing about the iPad launch.

We had protesters on the scene at the event, and launched a petition against
iPad DRM.  A summary of our main points (which you can glean by reading the
posts): it's a general purpose computer whose manufacturer (and its business
partners) have total veto power over the applications you can run.  This is
not the direction that anybody sane wants to see computing take.

Protest images from today's event:

And our petition:

Blog posts: http://defectivebydesign.org/

Thanks... not sure if we'll want to be using the list for stuff like this
all the time, but this seems like a pretty big deal, so I thought I'd ask
the group to get involved.  Should have sent this email four hours ago but I
was pretty overloaded today :) !!!

They are also in a way fork from Compiere like Adempiere difference is
Compiere and Openbravo got funded and Adempiere is going to stay a community
project , i think extra care is required in cases like these to dig bit more
and know what we are promoting, sticking to Community licenses  instead of
Hybrid ones is a good practice for an exercise like yours.

qmy two cents :-)

Don't ask just for the sack of asking and don't expect that the info
should be available as you wish.

Hi all,
         How to run a script on the event of another process getting killed.
Like once a GUI app is closed by clicking the x at the top right corner of
the window(usually), i should invoke a script.

How to track the PID of the script we run?

How to look for the PID's state of getting killed?

If I have to run 'app' and invoke 'app2' when 'app' exits

just create a app.sh that first calls app and have app2 after it. now,
remember not to background app. Its not the most brilliant thing to
do, but yes it probably can get you started.
<script>
#!/bin/bash

app
app2
<script ends>

Now there are $ variables that can get you the pid etc, right?

Have a look at Monit [1]. It can run like a daemon and monitor file, process
and device. We use this to check the status  of process like Apache and
MySQL (includes problem reporting and  automatic restore as well).

Doing so, wont that just start 'app2' sequentially after 'app', not
considering the status of 'app' being killed( or still running). ???

But, I need to start 'app2' only after 'app' being killed.

I think the script will come to the next line only upon exiting the
first. Unless of course, you backgrounded the job or nohuped it.

watchdog approach is very generic. And check the trap command also.

touch a file in say /var/lock/subsys

(This is the way yum prevents another instance)

Also checkout auditd.

Hello Rajkumar,

Installing linux is not something discussed here. This list is for people
who are linux users - mostly basic users.

So you should be able to install linux and then start using it. Then
you can ask questions if you get stuck with something.

If you dunno how to install linux you can download one of the liveCD ISO
images or USB stick images from

http://www.slax.org

or

http://www.damnsmalllinux.org

and then try out stuff.

Installing to hard disk is not the only way to use linux. ;)

Please expect to spend a few months learning.

Best of luck.

Message-ID: <e46f5c721001292301q17469699xa71e4fc2ab38d0a@mail.gmail.com>

A half day Foss Advocacy programme conducted at Vidhya Mandir Arts and
Science College, Uthangarai, Krishnagiri District on 28.01.2010. Around 250
students from II & III year BCA and B.Sc(Com.Sci) and 12 faculty members
were participated. The topic covered are, the basics, importance and
advantages of open source, Many live examples and demos of basic tools
covered and finally briefed about ILUGC.

Since the college is in rural area they are very new to open source. But
they are very much impressed about the advantages of using Open source
tools.

Before that i had meeting with the faculty of BCA, B.Sc(CS) and BBA (CA).
Around 24 faculty members were present. We had discussed various usage of
Open source tools, how to create awareness and take the open source tools to
the students community, how to adopt open source tools in the college, where
can the faculty and students gets support finally briefed about the ILUGC
activity.

Had  very good feedback from the students and college authority. They wanted
to have some more sessions on this area.

I thank the Principal, Dr. K. Arul,  the BCA HOD Ms. Kavitha and all the
faculty members for the opportunity. They promised that, very soon they are
going to have FOSS lab and FOSS Club in their campus.

Hi Friends,

Schooltool is written in Zope and some one who wants to contribute to
project can customize this project. IMO some functionalities like sending
sms, one can integrate Gammu with schooltool as both have python support.

Fedena, is another upcoming project for school management, but so far there
is no code available for public participation.

In between, i could not find any appropriate software for 'school
management' domain. When i queried sf.net , returned nothing.

Thyagarajan Shanmugham.

Are you trying to filter the output for desired contents?
If so, little text processing can do that by piping the output to simple
tools like tail, head, grep, sed, awk, etc.

Ha ha.

This line is quite good. What is tcp[13] == 2? Ok, you are checking for
SYN flag.

tcpdump is an overloaded utility and you use that cleverly only after
substantial experience and networking knowledge.

netstat is usually a better friend.

But you want to look at outgoing connection requests which netstat
may not help you out with.

Basically I am sure you understand that if a site is unreachable, and
if your Internet connection is alive then the only alternative is for TCP to
timeout and applications usually time out at their layers. So firefox
might have a timeout to identify connection outage.

I want to know what you really mean by "tracking unavailability from a
user perspective".

The browser tab itself clearly says that the site is down. What more
do you need?

In fact there are several tcp* utilities in UNIX for looking at outgoing
TCP connection requests. You can look at them perhaps.

I am searching for a best school management tool
There is no tool satisfying Indian school system.
Finally I have handed over it to a team who is doing it under open source.
There are doing a good job

I don't have knowledge of network and netstat would not help me that
is why I used the first and foremost of the connection establishment
packet.

Pardon my ignorance.

Indeed, if a human is sitting in front of it. But a human can Lie and
in IMHO Audit/SLA hard data is generally relied on which can only be
captured, again imho, by script / inotify / auditd or some such
mechanism.

Why not do a 'GET' request on the relevant resources (using the HTTP lib of
the language of your choice) periodically (say every few mins) and check for
connection timed out errors and log/process them accordingly!

I do it every 15 mins anyway using:

curl  <mumble>

to track availability.

It is the 15 mins (or variable) gap that I am concerned about.

We are talking about SLA requirements here....

Basically  a CYA audit requirement which will refelct on
revenues/penalties and the such...

The clients are distributed across many L2 and L3 towns/villages in a
state and you all may be knowing the link and power conditions in
India.

I assume you want to verify that a remote browser is able to stay connected
with your server and if it is not connected, you want a log of those events.
So, this monitoring script should run in the remote machine. Am I right?

Just curious: are you using tcpdump (running on each client pc!) to monitor
every request made by a browser instance, watch for its associated
responses,  if no response is received in n seconds assume the connection
has timed out and log all this periodically to a central server?

IMO, writing a firefox plugin would be simpler!!

You got it :)

Without all the overhead of Squid Proxy.... coz clients are _not_

It will take me couple of months. and I don't have that kind of time
or skill. I am just that stupid and "arrogant" sysadmin  :( .

Hi Friends,

i am happy to share this piece of information with you all.
the London stock exchange has switched to Linux-based MilleniumIT trading
platform.The LSE expects significant performance increases and cost savings
over its current Microsoft .NET based TradElect system. The Linux based
trading platform is estimated to be able to process about 50 times more
transactions. Besides providing a more competitive high performance platform
required to accommodate the increasing number of high-frequency traders,
MilleniumIT also brings efficient and flexible in-house IT development
competence.

Hi All
the aim is to read and count only 100 characters from input text file containing characters of A, G, C, T....of 500 or more.... The PHP script which I appended here reads all the 500 or whatever is present in the input file. The help which I expect from the forum is to find and correct the mistake by which it can read and count only the limited number of characters to be set as a condition.
<?php
$file="co3.txt";
$handle=fopen($file, 'r');
$A=0;
$G=0;
$C=0;
$T=0;
$contents[] = '';
    while(!feof($handle)) {
   $contents[] = fread($handle, 100);
}
#echo($contents);
 { $readchar=fgetc($handle);
  $readchar=strtoupper($readchar);
for ($i=0; $i<100; $i++)
{
#echo ($contents[$i]);
if($contents[$i] == 'A' )    # && ($A++ <=100))

/***to draw an image of thin vertical rectangular line for every characters read and counted which is secondary***/

}
    else
    if ($contents[$i] == 'G' )  # ($G++ <=100))
{
    $G++;
#   if ( $G++ <= 100 ) {
    imagefilledrectangle($img, $x1, $y1, $x2, $y2, $black);
    $x1=$x1+6;
    $x2=$x2+6;
}
    else
    if ($contents[$i] == 'C' )  #($C++ <=100))
{
    
    $C++;
