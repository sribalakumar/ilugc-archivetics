 "-" gives "Forbidden" permission denied
Message-ID: <CAHhM8gDbcdBEDMNhKupnoWiiPzehYPD=69TPPDZLWSVki9WukQ@mail.gmail.com>

OS CentOS6.4 (amd64) LAMP setup with the latest updates applied.

I have installed mod_security add on from the EPEL repo.

After activating mod_security, any URI that has the character dash (-)
in the dir/file name string is denied.

I have renamed a few dir/files and for sure the changed URIs work but
there are just too many to changes.
I have searched but have not found anything to solve the problem.

Any suggestion how to solve this within mod_security settings?

Hi,

I came across this link today
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_adopters and was wondering
which organisations in India (both private and govt) have adopted
linux/foss in various forms. I think most private organisations which
adopted linux/foss must be happy with their decisions while govt
institutions must have only paid lip service to such an initiative --a
case in point is the decision by NIC to support FOSS or decision by
NIC to help adoption of ubuntu in the judiciary starting from the
supreme court of india.

Also it seems the commercial indian linux entities are particularly
weak in promoting/marketing their strengths as most egovernance
projects are losing out to windows as a result of higher corruption
and weakness in technical competence of the indian companies. So
ubuntu will be more readily adopted by the end users in the
home/residential segment and the small scale sector-- whether ngo or
private establishments.

Hai to all

Small suggestion to all .. For those who want to learn enthusiastic linux
.. for them just post to ilugc ..

For installation and all .. we can share desktop (via) team viewer  / skype
to help to them to install linux successfully

its an better option to those who make their first step into Linux ! ( a
small way of spending little bit time  for installation )

learn they may learn step by step ... !



criticisims & Suggestions & Shoutings are always welcome !

thanks

The tools you have mentioned above are non-free, proprietary software
and we don't recommend or encourage the use of such tools here on this
list. There are videos demonstrating the installation of various
distros on the internet and they are just a search away on your
favorite search engine.

If not in VM sharing desktop may not be that easy before installation.
I may be wrong but just I felt so. Team Viewer / Skype are proprietary
- why don't we find a better open source software for screen sharing?

Since Wikipedia is collaboratively edited, you can add it yourself
with the relevant references.

> Please ask google to correct their latest stupidity which forces top posting

While it encourages top posting, it doesn't force it. I am now
replying using the new interface and have no issues using it to send
interleaved, trimmed replies. Things you might have to do before being
able to post properly:

1. Select plain text mode as the default.
2. When you reply to any email, the cursor is on top with a [..]
button below. Clicking that expands the quote of the mail you're
replying to and you can easily interleave and trim your replies.

There are open source software for screen sharing. They are easy to setup
and use within a LAN. The problem is the complexity to set it up to work
behind a NAT which will be the maximum use case. For example your machine
will be in a LAN connected to the internet through a modem/router and the
target machine will also be connected to the internet in a similar fashion.
You need to open ports and do port forwarding in the router. This is no
easy task for a beginner.

Please explain the logistics of how to achieve the above.

Without an installation how will the user have a desktop and if s/he
already has a desktop then s/he is beyond installation help.

That is a tall order - have you given them any feedback directly?

You can opt to use the old composer style and it does not force top posting.
(my posting composed using Google web UI - trimmed, interleaved etc.)

      Three decades in IT, and still can't do interleaved trimmed

surprised ;).  (Of course tongue-in-cheek). Thanks

Hi LUGgies,

A suggestion for the monthly talks. In the past, based on the couple
of talks i've attended (maybe am stereotyping) but i felt they're more
programmer-centric. Though i benefited a great deal and learnt about
the technologies that underpin the GNU / Linux & FOSS ecosystem, I
would also love to hear on certain user-specific content. Perhaps one
session could be targeted towards beginners. This could help in
bringing new people as well.

My two cents worth -

- A moderated healthy discussion / review by panel on various distros
(Ubunutu, Mint, Debian,Fedora , etc)
- Discussion on features of various desktop environments (Mate,
Cinnamon, GNOME, KDE)
- Sessions on productivity s/w (Libreoffice and its kind)
- Multimedia editing tools available in opensource / linux
- How-to-do's of day-to-day desktop tasks.
- etc

If someone says Linux is not user-friendly and idiot-proof, am an
antithesis to that statement. ;-)

Will be happy to hear your views and love to see the suggestion
getting implemented.

Cheers,
Anand

Subject: [Ilugc] WAN bundling for ISP failover/multiplexing
Message-ID: <CALDskyxLRGe6EQK8aPoHp5eO15XzLTPxyMNBwKU4+Q+e4g59-A@mail.gmail.com>

Multiplexing multiple WAN links for traffic aggregation has been a
problem that dogged me
 for nearly 3 years or more.

I remember building a custom hardware for TalentPro in Venkatanarayana
road lugging a heavy
 gear with 4 NICs and trying to do ISP failover with two Airtel 2MBPS
connections trying to get
 an aggregate 4 MBPS.

I also went to the Airtel office nearby in Ramana enclave(not sure)
just 4 complexes away to
see whether they could give me some configuration access to their POP
when traffic leaves to the
 Internet.

Well that was I think more than 4 years ago.

I actually did WAN multiplexing with 2 wireless links for two clients
Brovis and net4in near
 Irungatukotai. That was I think around 3 years ago.

But my failures are more.

I tried this technology in Leatherlink Sivakumar's office and I think
nothing came out of it.

Recently less than a year ago I also tried this tech in a location in Bangalore.

Failures, failures and more failures.

And I have also communicated to LUG about several possibilities to achieve this.

But last night(around 10:30 or so) I saw a youtube video that
clarified a lot of things to me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIeXAqdbpzI

But I cannot apply this knowledge directly and most of you will not
follow this video.

You require background knowledge.

To put the whole story in short, basically you get true channel bonding through
 VPN aggregation using a remote site with multiple IP addresses
terminating on the same machine.

Then what you do is setup multiple static routes and route packets
through multiple ISP WAN links and
 then you have to bundle them together.

So for example, if you have 3 WAN links then you need 3 IP
addresses(public) in the remote VPS node.

Then you setup 3 different OpenVPN VPN connections using the 3 WAN
links to terminate on the 3 IP addresses
 which will create 3 different tap interfaces on the remote VPN/VPS node.

Then on both sides you have to bundle together these 3 VPN interfaces
into one virtual interface and then assign
 an IP address here and an IP address there.

So in the OpenVPN private address space you assign a local IP for the
interface bundle on one side(client side at our
 location) and on the server side at the VPS node. Then you set the
default gateway of the remote bundle IP
 to the local network at our premises.

Then we are done!

Now you will get full real traffic aggregation giving you the real sum
of the bandwidths offered by the links in both directions.

If you have total of 4 MPBS down and 2 MBPS up you will get exactly that.

Really cool.

I am yet to test this.

You do this differently on Linux and OpenBSD.

But the idea is the same.

I going to try this and release an open source project for the same.

Another instance. What makes you think that folks will not follow it
and need background knowledge? Do not be so condescending. We are here
to share knowledge and not play one-upmanship.

You will be better off not earning the ire of the members of this group.

Message-ID: <CAND2797Kzk8tES09TUUQ+vgQfYT3dPGVccV6o+8PXOdOBUNffg@mail.gmail.com>

Source: http://www.debian.org/News/2013/20130504

 After many months of constant development, the Debian project is
proud to present its new stable version 7.0 (code name "Wheezy").
This new version of Debian includes various interesting features such
as multiarch support, several specific tools to deploy private clouds,
an improved installer, and a complete set of multimedia codecs and
front-ends which remove the need for third-party repositories.

Multiarch support, one of the main release goals for "Wheezy", will
allow Debian users to install packages from multiple architectures on
the same machine. This means that you can now, for the first time,
install both 32- and 64-bit software on the same machine and have all
the relevant dependencies correctly resolved, automatically.

The installation process has been greatly improved: Debian can now be
installed using software speech, above all by visually impaired people
who do not use a Braille device. Thanks to the combined efforts of a
huge number of translators, the installation system is available in 73
languages, and more than a dozen of them are available for speech
synthesis too.
In addition, for the first time, Debian supports installation and
booting using UEFI for new 64-bit PCs (amd64), although there is no
support for "Secure Boot" yet.

Hi,

I felt, like our school students are not utlizing the computer for their
skill growth/opportunities.

In our olden days we don't have such facilities are penetration. But today
the internet/computer penetration is high, in schools also it is there. But
still it can improve lot.

I am collecting the list of applications which can be used for students
(probably 5th Std onwards).

1) Basic computer training
     how to use, OS, internet ,etc
2) Documentation & Presentation applications
    Application : Ms- office / LibreOffice
3)Drawing applications  (helps to improve their drawing & desinging skills)
4) Multimedia applications
5) Games ( Mind, brain games)
6) Maths & Science oriented applications
<have to identify the list>
7)Contributing in Internet applications
- contributing in wikipedia (students will be intersted on this)
- contributing in maths/science  - discussions/forums etc.

Please add the list with your ideas/perceptions.

Thanks

 just send a mail asking for the same . if it does not then you can think
of the other course of action i see this being worked out of the Anna
University , so may be NRCFOSS folks know them already its matter of
educating them if they are not doing it.

there are two parts to it managing the school itself with Foss and Learning
for using Foss which i think you are trying to cover

in the first category  we have http://www.projectfedena.org/ , Koha, Moodle
and many more

in the second one i would go with something like http://www.nand2tetris.org/

apart from the tangible cost benefit the intangible benefits we would get
are social skills,communications,  the responsibility of maintaining school
network should be owned by them.

Dear shrini, you may recall that I had suggested that some of you meet up
with dr. Nakkeeran, director of Tamil virtual academy.There is an advisory
committee to recommend hardware and software for the incubation centre. A
meeting is scheduled on 10th. Some of you could suggest the software set
from FOSS arena - can be sent to me or discussed and collated in this list
so that I can pass on the same during the meeting.

To start with, the recommendation is to provide development facilities to
individuals or small groups. While the govt would like to use the output in
the state depts and agencies, the developer has an option to take the
product and sell. We plan to suggest the FOSS route, but there are many
steps in between.

I fell the following action will help:
Recommend a plethora of FOSS tools and apps which will help the developer
While windows, photoshop, etc., are likely to enter the space, we plan to
ensure that at least 3-4 systems will be Linux based, MySQL -PostgreSQL can
be the main databases, libreoffice, gimp, blender, orca, etc., will find a
place. Mr. Prince from Nic and myself on behalf of nr cfoss/cdac, with help
from other members (mani manivannan, chellappan) hope to offer FOSS related
support from the organs, lug and other communities.

Pool up info on useable work already done in Indian languages

Propose projects by FOSS Tamil community members -- taking advantage of
similar works done elsewhere and show casing how the community interactions
help.

The mail members may have other suggestions.

Thanks and best wishes
Srinivasan

In this news, there is no information about incubation center or
entrepreneurship.

When is the execution starts?
How can people approach the center for their development works?
Do they have to pay any fee?
How long a startup can be incubated there?

Is there any public announcements of these offers?

Good initiatives.

Will there any announcement for getting suggestions from public.?
or this is once of the closed group activities?

Thanks for the suggestions.

I agree your views.
As you mentioned, I am interested on second category. But nand2tertis talks
much in advanced levels (kind of collage education).
The school kids range may be above 5th std,  there are plenty of opensouce
tools available which help them to improve their subjects skills, mind
power & communication,presentation skills etc and open up many
opportunities to them.  I am trying to collect those information.
Please share your views.

All please contribute your suggestions/ideas on this topic ,

thanks
suresh.

To: network at lists.fosscom.in


Dear friends,

A delegation from the Free Software Movement of India and other groups
have submitted a representation demanding the revision of the decision
of the AICTE making the usage of Office-365 mandatory on the 30th of
April 2013.

A group of young parliamentarians led by P Rajeev also made a
representation to the AICTE chairman raising concerns that were
similar on 07-05-13. The signatories include Rajeev Chandrasekhar,
Sitaram Yechury, KN Balagopal, PK Biju CP Narayanan, Prashantho
Chatterjee, Tapan Sen, Dr T Seema and MP Achutan.

We understand that the AICTE has now agreed and is removing the
mandatory clause from the notice. We welcome this decision. However,
we demand that AICTE should revise the decision of using Office-365
totally, as it is not in the interest of the students, institutions
and colleges. AICTE as a public funded body should not engage in
supporting proprietary systems.

We also thank all those in the academia, intellectuals, developer
community, policy makers and parliamentarians who have taken it up
with AICTE for revising the decision.

TVA, with directions from State Govt (Dept of IT) had done some prelim
works few months back. a meeting was held inviting members from academia
working in language computing, industry persons (primarily those who had
interacted with TVA on font development, etc.) -- i had alerted some of
you. ramadoss(myself and dr ranjani from AU) couldn't attend as we had some
other meeting. Request was made to suggest software/hardware setups.

In the meantime, TVA had to wait for further directives from the govt. as
you are aware, things move slowly for a long time and suddenly a spurt
happens. will update this list after attending the next advisory group
meeting which is scheduled for 10th.
in the meantime, i can collate any input i receive and present the same
during our discussions.

How does the code quality compare between open source and proprietary
software?
Open source code - 0.69 defects / 1000 lines code
Proprietary code - 0.68 defects / 1000 lines code.

Apparently the industry average for good quality software is 1.0 defects /
1000 lines of code.

The fact that distributed development of open source software
can achieve par with proprietary software is so awesome!

Much of the sought information can be found here <https://mariadb.org/>.

As for distro switched - IIRC, It replaced MySQL in openSUSE 12.3.

forks tend to carry legacy code and most of the time they will be
compatible , until and unless i have something to work on and lots of time
to kill i would not bother digging the differences just for the sake of
argument.

Is it practically possible to have 0 defects in a project with a million
lines of code with contributors from around the world? I thought it is
awesome that open source development spread around the world can reach a
defect density of 0.69/1000 compared to 0.68/1000 for proprietary software.
In fact the article says that Linux is the benchmark for quality at a
defect density of 0.59/1000 for 7.6 million lines of code.

Pray tell us how many lines of non-commentary source code have you
written in your IT career and how many bugs were written against them.

IMO, no.   In my past life (mid 1980s), I worked at one of the world's
largest Telecom manufacturer.   The code review and walk throughs were
intense, internal QA hammered the code and yet there were field
reported bugs.

A bug is a bug.   IMO, even incorrect comment in the code is a bug, it
impairs maintainability of the source.

The numbers above fail to to meet your own benchmark (0).

You are correct. It should be. However, it often isn't. What does
happen is that with closed source software you default to trusting
that the vendor has done everything right. The fact that you do not
have access to the source code can encourage and provide incentive for
ugly code flows.

> It means that open source community is "passable" or IOW is worse

The difference between that and open source is that you have access to
the source code. There are vendors who analyse application source code
(Coverity, Blackduck etc) and, you can choose to undertake
investigation yourself if you are competent, capable and know what you
are doing. The fact that code that is pushed to a publicly available
repository is "forever on the internet" is a remarkable motivator to
do things the right way or, at least tell people that you have a piece
that is currently ugly but will be revised. So, the evolution from
"passable" to beautiful is transparent and collaborative.

Now, the question remains around which model of software development
would you default your trust on.

iD is a non-flash JS editor for OpenStreet Map . OSM was missing a
nice editor especially on the web and iD would fill up the gap .

Sending the forwarded message . Looking forward to see more of Chennai
on OSM[1] .

To: talk at openstreetmap.org


Hi all!

Today, we've tagged iD editor v1.0.0 and integrated it into
openstreetmap.org, thanks to Tom Hughes, Ansis Brammanis, John Firebaugh,
Saman Bemel-Benrud, Richard Fairhurst, Alex Barth, and many many others.

It's been a long 7 months of development which we've chronicled on
http://mapbox.com/osmdev/, and before launch more than 8,000 changesets were
made with iD. We're really excited for this to reach many more people and
improve really rapidly.

So try out iD if you haven't yet, and make some edits! As with any project,
there are rough edges that we'll be refining in the coming weeks, many of
which are already reported and some of which you should report. We're
tracking bugs and features at
https://github.com/systemed/iD/issues?state=open and if you'd like to
contribute, we have a great guide at
https://github.com/systemed/iD/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Cheers!

Hi,

I have spoken with a leading Hospital to migrate their existing windows
systems to Linux and that too specific to Ubuntu 12.04.

They also use Tally ERP 9 which needs to be installed in Ubuntu. Does
anybody succeeded  with installing tally ERP 9 using wine or play on Linux?
Is it recommended to install and use it in production?

this is a meeting of the advisory group -- primarily to suggest possible
actions and some basic framework. i presume there will be a bit more "back

announcement be made and an open meet/workshop be held.

+1. Nginx is kicka$$. The ease of setup+configuration will remove/avoid a

Greetings, tshrinivasan,
A Discussion has been created in group Chennai Drupal Community:
Drupal Camp Chennai

We have had Drupal camps in Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and
now it?s time for Drupal camp Chennai!

What would Drupal camp Chennai mean? It would be an opportunity for
Drupal enthusiasts in Chennai and across India to share their Drupal
knowledge and spread the power of Drupal.

The key objectives would be:


Bring the local Drupal community together :)

Invite speakers from Across country to share their knowledge &amp; experience

Conduct Drupal training

Get participation from industry not only drupal programmers

CONTRIBUTE BACK TO DRUPAL: Run day long sprint to learn how to give
back to the community!


Let synch up, learn from past organisers and make this happen together.

Watch out for more on Drupal Camp Chennai!

Hello,

I'm writing to let you know about 'Open Source Contribution Through Micro
Finance'.

Take a moment to check it out on Indiegogo and also share it with your
friends. All the tools are there. Get perks, make a contribution, or simply
follow updates. If enough of us get behind it, we can make 'Open Source
Contribution Through Micro Finance' happen!

I am also open for big investment in return of % share in profit.

I think this is important political development regarding software
development and software patents.

Any thoughts?

IIRC, software is not patent-able in India as well.   The devil is in
the details - implementation and enforcement of the bills.

Wine works well for a few apps. I think Tally would have been
developed using the dotnet framework. I've had problems running such
apps whether with Mono or the native dotnet framework installed under
wine. You will have better results running Tally under Windows in a VM
like Virtualbox. Takes away the claim that one can be Windows free
though.

Multiuser Tally has a web interface, I recall. If that were the case,
you could have the Tally server alone on Windows.

Most of the low-mid range storage vendors integrate a customized
firmware based on the Linux kernel.

As for HW compatibility with FreeNAS , the "spoke in the wheel" will
be the drivers for the on board chip set.

Make sure FreeBSD supports the chipset.   I would suggest contact
local storage vendors and see if they will let you evaluate FreeNAS on
their box.   You can create a Disk on Module - using an usb drive and
take it to the vendor's lab.

Also discuss their hardware warranty policy  vis-a-vis using your own
solution v/s their "custom" firmware.

openindiana (the fork of opensolaris) or Nexenta (the CE supports upto
18TB) are other software options.

for starting an activity/company/project you need capital and that's
exactly you are soliciting, people put money when the
company/project/activity is already started and working.

when FSF started RMS never asked for money , Linus also started the same
way , why look around when we have stories like Anand Babu , who never
solicited money for his project gluster its was later transformed into
company and people put there money in.

i think people would be more perceptive to the  idea like if you have said
i am starting a cooperative , think the way Amul dairy was started.

>> Sorry, if it happens to be top-posting.
>> A year back, met a Tally Sales person a year back at one of the MNC data
center.  He said they have a version for Linux / Unix.  Did not follow it
up then.

If Windows is bad and Tally helping Ubuntu replace Windows is good,
then that requires a serious introspection.

The biggest barrier that forbids users from switching over to Free/
Open software are non-availibity of applications for their domain
specific needs.

The first question to put forth when you want to assist someone
migrate to free software is to ask what are the day-to-day
applications they run?

And if those applications do not have a binary for GNU/ Linux
environment, ask them to first start replacing from those app & not
the OS.

OpenERP is an alternative. As the thread pertains to a Medical
Industry, FSF's award winning application OpenMRS might give solution
in course of time, provided you take up the burden of customization.

Else, let the customer enjoy a happy married life with both Tally & Windows. ;-)

+1 but there is a learning curve.

It is hearsay - it is possible to plug out MySQL and plug in MariaDB
and your PHP/Python apps don't know the difference.   I am not a web
app developer so cannot vouch for the statement.

I am running MariaDB on my local machine and the same app works properly
with the MySQL on server, without any changes.
Not sure if all the MySQL engines are available in MariaDB and vice versa.

I think one of the best humorous answers I could see till now. I kept
laughing for at least 2 minutes.

Ashokan Sir- is there any further discount possible please tell me. :)


Jokes apart :

Dear Yuvraj - Open Source/FOSS products are all about choice. There is
nothing like best ultimately it is all relative. So, you need to figure it
out for yourself. For some MySQL will be good and for some others it will
be PostgreSQL or MariaDB.

So, you need to weigh the pros and cons of each and every product if at all
you would like to put this into production and then take a calculated
decision. All the best

Wow, my clients, through whom I make a living, do not talk or email me
in this kind of language.

How much are you paying the members in this list that you are
demanding answers in such language?

And what about please and thanks?

Hi

I found on the net that this is the command I need to be in to edit a
binary file after converting to hex.

:%!xxd


I am confused as to why we use the *%* sign.  I know that if we need to run
shell command we can press ESC + colon + exclamation + <shell command>.

% implies the contents of the file you are editing, for example:

:%sort
will sort all the lines of the file alphabetically

:%s/this/that/g
will substitute all the occurrences of 'this' with 'that' in the file you are 
editing and ...

:!wc -l %

with execute the command "wc -l" (echo the number of lines) passing the current 
file as an argument.

*%* in ex mode in Vi/Vim editor refers to *all* lines.

*Ranges in Vi/Vim: *Type *:help range * in your Vi/Vim editor
*
*

   - In your case you could specify the range * :1,5!xxd*  executes
*!xxd*command from line 1 to line 5. or
   - you can do it on all lines by *:%!xxd *or
   -  you can specify *:.,$!xxd *which will execute the command from
   current line till the end of the file or
   - you can specify *:.,'c!xxd * if c is a mark made in your file, this
   command would execute from current line till the mark.

Better to think of it as the contents of the edit buffer rather than file

The International Space Station has decided to switch dozens of laptops

years?that Linux delivers greater stability and reliability for public and

Space Alliance contractor manager involved in the switch. The change at the
International Space Station is all about the replacement of dozens of
laptops with XP being switched over to Debian 6.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_sharpshooter_fallacy
This kind of cognitive blind-spot occurs when we ignore a huge set of data
and focus on a small subset of data.
Yet, we know so little about the Satoshi Nakamoto identity.
I have tried to account for all that we do know, however fallibly.

Some readers have brought to my attention, two other data points which I
did not know about.
1. Bitcoin was written in C++. Shinichi Mochizuki knows C++
2. Mochizuki wrote papers on elliptic curves, the basis of modern
cryptography.

The mystery deepens! ;-)
I invite everyone to join me on Twitter ( @purrperl ) to discuss this.

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

Didnt notice the change of meeting location of this month ILUGC meeting.

But we four persons(include 2 enthusiastic students) made it like a
brainstorming session in front of Aerospace building :-). It was
interesting by discussing generally about innovative technologies which
will be implemented in near future. It was different experience in my ILUGC

Message-ID: <CAND2794pc4tng3qtm_eNhToj6tLHfmVREGzev5G2uZvLbKRJqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Source: http://www.chrisjohnston.org/ubuntu/virtual-ubuntu-developer-summit-13-05

Today, May 14 starts the second Virtual Ubuntu Developer Summit
http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-1305/

Based on feedback, this vUDS will be three days long. Don?t forget to register
http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-1305/registration/

for the event. A list of currently approved blueprints is available on
Launchpad.
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sprints/uds-1305
If you find that one is missing, you can create your own. Keep an eye
out this week for scheduling to start.

Tracks?

App Development: Alan Pope, David Planella & Michael Hall
Community: Daniel Holbach, Nick Skaggs & Jono Bacon
Client: Jason Warner & Sebastien Bacher
Server & Cloud: Dave Walker & Antonio Rosales
Foundations: Steve Langasek

Bugs?

One of the bugs that has long effected Summit has been that a
blueprint had to have a specific status. This will finally no longer
effect us! If a blueprint is marked anything other than Obsolete or
Superseded it will now show up on the schedule as long as it is
approved by a track lead. A huge thanks to Steve Kowalik and William
Grant for getting this fixed!

Another issue that seemed to confuse people is having to register

The idea of setting up a kiosk is wonderful. It would also be wonderful to
burn iso in USB Drives too, I hardly see people carry CD/DVD's today.

Message-ID: <CAND2797n5nfAR-dbeV=3SVMykDor0VS0F0cNTzBzUqFqXXW5fg@mail.gmail.com>

source: http://www.muktware.com/5576/opensuse-launches-life-linux-education

openSUSE Education team has announced the first release of Li-f-e
(Linux for Education).

http://lizards.opensuse.org/2013/05/08/announcing-the-release-of-opensuse-edu-li-f-e-12-3-1/

Based on openSUSE 12.3, the first issue is carries the version number
12.3-1. Li-f-e comes with all the official updates applied and
available in all major desktop environments including Gnome, KDE and
Cinnamon.

Jigish Gohil writes on openSUSE blog:

    ...it includes wide range of software catering to the needs of
everyone, selection from openSUSE Education repository, multimedia
from the Packman repository, development tools, KIWI-LTSP allowing
normal PC or diskless thin clients to network boot from a server
running Li-f-e and lot more. To summarize, everything you need to make
your computer useful is available right out of the box as soon as
Li-f-e is installed on it.

You can download Li-f-e from this link. (a 64 bit version is also available)
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opensuse-edu/
http://susestudio.com/search?q=opensuse-edu

Li-f-e will offer a healthy competitor to Edubuntu, and further spread
the proliferation of GNU/Linux in education segment.

before sending the query to the db, print the same query in the screen
and in a text file.
check the charset of the content in the file.

If you had done a simple search, you would have found the answers yourself

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=is+rust+a+open+source+language

Yes, it is a open source language.  No, it is not currently used by any 
Mozilla *product* .  It is at a research stage and only public project 
using it is a experimental browser engine project from Mozilla that may 
replace Gecko in the distant future.   It has some similarities with 
Google Go language just in case you have heard about it.

	Zuckerburg ?
Message-ID: <CAK8uBvH=tTWj0wsQjv6nPD=u548D0O3nT5CMbGnVLiwz_3xuhg@mail.gmail.com>

Hai to all

Can India produce a Mark Zuckerberg? and the response was marvelous. So i
decided to collect it together and make it into a list  some of the
questions and problems related to it.
An average Indian spends about 30 minutes of his time on the internet every
day.  On that Facebook and Google tops the list. Young men, college and
school going students dominate the social media in urban India. A survey,
conducted by Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and IMRB,
said the young men contribute nearly 35% to the overall urban social
networking base. About 34 % are from the top 8 metros, an equal pie is
contributed by small towns with a population of up to 5 lakh. Facebook
virtually dwarfs all other social networking sites in India, with 97% of 5
crore of active Internet users accessing the site.

Everyone uses Google at least once a day and Google has become a starting
place for all information?s.

So Why indian enterperneurs not having the   idea of start up sites Like
Facebook  or etc .,

It means that everybody have their own idea in their domains .. or their
fields .

But they dont know how to start up the concepts in Web ?

I request to Ilugc to Create a blog for awareness to enterprenuers to avail
of these technologies u make wonders like tat for example
 php,mysql,python,ruby on rails ... then the start ups will come more and
employability will come more

Criticisms are always welcome !  May be this Post is too long ... But its
the initiative to grow up More  :-)

Thanks

For every success, there are thousands of ideas that never took off.

An entrepreneur does *not* wait for others to give him/her idea.  They
are highly self motivated people and pursue their dream irrespective
of others laughing at them.   I recall Jeff Bezos (Amazon.com)
interviews in the early 2000s and defending his idea of selling books
online.   It took patience, belief in his idea and being at it.  It
also needed a lot of convincing to financiers.

Are you willing to put in this kind of effort?

programming for the same market highest number are coming from India.

this is the only valid point i agree to , i work with these startups and
there is a thriving ecosystem of them who are indeed creating Jobs.

there are different facets you are trying to mix up , your initial
hypothesis itself is skewed , because entrepreneurship cannot be only
limited to making capital and  success  cannot be only measured in how much
wealth one has acquired , what do you think of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Salk as a person was he successful ?

i for one has been the same quest so decided to write some stories to learn
more and inspire
http://satyaakam.net/2013/05/10/who-is-a-foss-contributor-and-how-his-life-should-be-celebrated/
,
would like to hear about any person you know of to be covered may be
introduced to me.

thanks

We often see many people in this list suggesting ideas about
entrepreneurship. But if you ask them if they are ready for putting
effort in it, then they will become silent.

The people behind UDProducts are young entrepreneurs who have started
their web business before even completing their engineering education.
They are self motivated students who never thought of searching jobs.
If these entrepreneurs could be well encouraged and supported (i.e.
financially) , then India will have more entrepreneurs than any other
country.

Just my thoughts.

lack of capital is  one thing there is no corpus fund to support these kind
of initiatives the other way round is to  give them work so that they not
only become self reliant also know by committing mistakes learn what not to
 do next time. let me pass a lead to them and see how far they have come .
Yes this is one way of financing giving work which pays so that you are
afloat to begin with and survive to fight one more day.

 Stay Social with Firefox

Social sites are a key part of online life and with Firefox we want to make
it easier to use the Web the way you want.  Mozilla developed the Social
API to enable social providers to integrate directly into Firefox to make
your browsing experience more social, customizable and personal. The Social
API makes it easy for your favorite social providers to add a sidebar with
your content to Firefox or notification buttons directly on the Firefox
toolbar.

Last year we launched with Facebook as the first social integration partner
in Firefox. Today, we are adding multiple new social providers Cliqz, Mixi
and msnNOW to Firefox, in addition to Facebook Messenger for Firefox, to
help you stay connected to your social networks, no matter where you go on
the Web.

The new social providers in Firefox make it even easier for you to keep up
with friends, family, news and events while you surf the Web. You can get
real time updates about news activity, entertainment or your personal
network while you browse the Web.

Hey all,

As you all might be knowing, earlier last month we opened a thread introducing Open Weekends - an initiative to bring all the OSS and tech communities in Chennai together in one place for us to learn and share.?

And thanks to all who helped it shape up and now its finally happening!?

The last weekend of this month - on the 25th and 26th, Open Weekends will take place at the ThoughtWorks campus, Chennai. Wikipedia, Mozilla and Open Stack communities in Chennai will be participating this time.?

The first day is for talks and sessions and hackathons will happen the second day. The detailed schedule and agenda of the event will be let out shortly. But, for now if someone wants to give a talk about anything related to open source, web technologies and anything else related to tech, please email me directly with your name, contact number, topic (with abstract) and duration.?

Thanks !
Dwarak.

Dear Members

What PC configuration would you recommend for Web Development (PHP, MySQL,
etc.)? Mainly what processor and RAM.

Do you really need an i7 processor with 2+ GHz machine? Or would a basic
Ubuntu system with Dual Core processor & 2 GB RAM do?

you are asking for support and help from people who do not understand what
you want to do , lucky are few who get an ecosystem where there  friends
and family members are supporting in honing there skills and ideas
. Entrepreneurial path is sometimes filled with boredom and loneliness one
has to even fight that ....more than once it happens people around you will
not  understands what  you want do .

I like to use my netbook running AMD E350 APU and 6 GB of RAM. You don't
need a powerful CPU as you're not compiling anything. I prefer more RAM as
these days browsers end up using most of the RAM and I prefer my system not
to be sluggish and that RAM is pretty cheap, if you have DDR3.
This setup gives me advantage of not having to lug around a heavy machine
and it gives a better battery life than usual laptops. And it's portable
than having having a desktop so I can carry it around.

If you are comfortable with vim / emacs then a system with low
configuration will do. There are some devices with 2GB RAM and 1.5+
GHz dual core ARMv7 that cost less than 100$ (need a HDMI tv / monitor
though) which you can give a try - most of them come with android but
some support Ubuntu Linux. If that works out it is going to be dead
cheap. If that did not work out you got a cool smart TV :).

Hope this helps,

Thanks a lot Mehul for sharing your spec.

How much does your netbook setup cost in all? Also, a netbook mostly comes
with a small display (less than 14", if I am not wrong). If so, won't it be
uncomfortable developing a web app on a netbook, assuming that you are
spending at least 10 hrs a day in front of it?

Hi,

This is not exactly true. There are plenty of Indian entrepreneurs. Off the top 
of my head I can think of Gluster, SlideShare, PubMatic, Druva (disclaimer: I 
personally know the CEO of Druva) ...etc. All of these are pretty much market 
leaders in their market space, just like Facebook is in the socail network space.

That said, there are a few realities that are specific to India which act as 
deterrents or disadvantages toward entrepreneurship in India. This articles 
covers some of these problem:

http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-01-25/news/36548273_1_young-entrepreneurs-seedfund-job

Besides these, those are some practical issues too:
a. In India children's education and emergency medical costs are something that 
you have to plan towards and save up for. These costs are low to non-existent in 
a lot of developed nations. So bootstapping is much harder here in your 20s-30s 
unless you come from reasonably wealthy (and understanding) family.

b. In India, failure is seen negatively in startup circles (ie: by VCs and other 
potential investors or even family / society). In the valley VCs generally judge 
you from what you've learnt from your failures. So they are more likely to fund 
someone who has tried once and gained from the experience than a complete new 
entrepreneur. This is not true in India.

c. Government Bureaucracy and Corruption, coupled with arcane policies/lows 
governing the IT business.

Did you mean crontab?    It would have helped had you posted the
command line that works from the terminal and *not* from crontab.
Also you need to specify if it is a user crontab or system wide
crontab.

I enjoyed this informative article. One factor it briefly mentions is the
role of education in curbing entrepreneurship in India.
Education in India IMHO, seems to be optimized for the most common-case:
take a rural child, and impart skills that make her/him financially
self-sustaining.
Basically we mold children to get jobs.
Education is highly competitive, and has a hierarchical caste system that
would impress Aldous Huxley.
The Alphas, the students with the highest marks, study Science. Alphas
bifurcate into Maths ( Engineers etc. ) or Biology ( Doctors etc. ).
The Betas, the students with Ok marks, study Commerce.
The Gammas, are the students with low marks. The Gammas study Arts and
Humanities.

So, what's wrong with this picture? It certainly seems that all those
Commerce students should become entrepreneurs.
Turns out that most students are breathlessly escaping the poverty of the
previous generation.
The mindset is very utilitarian. Get a good job with more pay, and you're
Ok. :)

Problem is, we have already taught everyone that Art is for losers.
We are geared more towards producing Bill Gates than Steve Jobs.
( The dichotomy is false, but I will use it anyway. :)

Our educational system is designed to churn out money-making robots, rather
than imaginative, creative beings.
Hard work is not enough to become an entrepreneur!
Entrepreneurship takes courage, and imagination. Art teaches those
qualities.
Entrepreneurs go beyond just getting a job, like the system programmed
everyone to.
Entrepreneurs have hacked the OS that the CBSE installed in their brains.
Entrepreneurship demands artistic vision, not merely numbers!

For all my criticism of the Indian education system, I approve of its
utilitarian goals.
Reality is, India is a nation that is slowly but surely escaping the
clutches of poverty.
We do need Engineers, lots of them!

I wish that we would inculcate a healthy respect for Art.
Art is the magic ingredient that will make students more well-rounded, and
entrepreneurial.

Beyond that, Art makes people happier.
Here is some of my amateur art: http://bit.ly/artislife

Like others have said, more details will be needed to help you.
Nevertheless, the most common problem faced is what you have listed.
Users just plug in the command line as used in a terminal and the
command will not work. Terminals have shell with path to search which
cron does not have. Cron/Crontab needs the complete path of the
executable to be mentioned in the entry. should work then.

+1, Mohan!

Also, be sure to compare environment variables.
Run this command from the terminal, as well as from a cron job, ( using
different filenames to capture the output ).
env | sort > file.txt

Compare the two files manually.
This might help you troubleshoot.

Cheers,

Sorry I had to snip off the rest of your informative text.
I enjoyed reading that. Thanks.

I read another interesting article but I forgot where from:
It said the Indian school education system is `perfect`, but for what it
was designed for.
What was it designed for? To create perfect clerks for the British raj.

Time to wake up!

This might be a separate OT discussion - You need passion to become
entrepreneur and where's the passion? I might be generalizing too much, but
where's the passion? Very few people in my extended circle of friends, both
personal and work are passionate about anything. I am talking about true
joys of trying a new programming language, getting results out of a new
API, Listening to your fav singer live, clicking that perfect photograph,
enjoy the overwhelming sight of the milky way from a dark location...
Forget entrepreneurship, most wealthy and educated Indians need to learn
how to live - employed or self employed!

+1  Also, man 5 crontab has a plethora of working examples.  I don't
know if the OP has read that or not.

Also, I notice that OP is not willing to share the command line in
question that is *not* working for him in the crontab.

In the past, I have been bitten by the character '%' in the command
line.  It needs to be 'escaped.'  Also, cannot split the command line
into multiple lines with the char '\'

<quote>
The ``sixth'' field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to be
run.  The entire command por?
       tion of the line, up to a newline or % character, will be
executed by /bin/sh or by the shell speci?
       fied in the SHELL variable of the crontab file.  Percent-signs
(%) in the  command,  unless  escaped
       with  backslash (\), will be changed into newline characters,
and all data after the first % will be
       sent to the command as standard input. There is no way to split
a single command line onto  multiple
       lines, like the shell's trailing "\".

And, at the same time, the last 5 years have demonstrated a
willingness of a large number of individuals (of all ages) to attempt
to develop a business away from the "I'll get a job" model. I find
that reassuring because  it indicates that slowly (even if it is more
slowly than we'd like) the ability to take a chance is being built.

The part from the article with which I disagree is that it tends to
conclude that education is a means to an end. Education is, and mostly
has been a guide - a pointer to further ways of development.
Unfortunately, like all other things, it has morphed into an entity
which is measured by marks on the score-card.

It is crontab (tab as in table) and *not* crontap (tap as in faucet).
Please learn to use the correct terminology.

I just saw the TED talk by Sugata Mitra that Tavish posted.
Just mindblowing! No more canings. :)

I suggest a different testing strategy for the future.
Give the students all the resources they need to "know", all the time.
As Mr. Mitra says, "knowing is obsolete".
Let the students consult books, computers, the Internet, each other, and
anyone they can get to help, maybe even the teacher ( if she/he is not
careful ).
FOSS is one of those things. Children of the future should be given tools
they can evolve to their needs and share with others.
The slogan is: "By any means handy!"

The test will be that of imagination, not knowledge.
There will be no right answers, because the test-creator won't assume that
he/she is smarter than the test-takers.
In fact, we should give these wonderkids all the resources they need to
imagine, let them self-organize,
and sit back and expect to be blown away by their creative solutions.
They will come up with things we can't imagine! The current education
system doesn't account for the Flynn effect.
We have to acknowledge that our kids are going to be smarter than us, and
inhabit a very different world than us.
Mr. Mitra even suggests that children are an emerging new species, more
evolved than Homo Sapiens. What a thought!

Orson Scott Card's highly relevant book, "Ender's Game" is being made into
a movie.

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

Arch Wiki suggests making a new user for skype:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Skype#Use_Skype_with_special_user

You can call skype from the other user from terminal, you just need to add
following to your ~/.bashrc file:


##use skype
alias skype='xhost +local: && sudo -u skype /usr/bin/skype'
##don't allow skype to touch /home/user
umask 066

Message-ID: <CACm7z1ZSObTMK3RLOZr3FkYWdgOQPWfSrcUSXSk09=31txGm-Q@mail.gmail.com>

There are news all over Internet about Microsoft spying on its Skype users.
You can read a lot like this
http://www.zdnet.com/is-microsoft-reading-your-skype-instant-messages-7000015388/

Whether the news is true or false, people use skype, because they do not
find a perfect alternative for it. We have Ekiga, When I tried last time,
it does not even established connection properly. Now I recently came
through Jitsi - A Free software under GPL which looks promising and
available cross-platform.

If this functions well, it has the potential to replace Skype, and I have
just installed it and will try and post my review on it sooner or later. If
this is worth, then we have to promote this tool as a community behind Free
Software and Open Source.

Jitsi Website - https://jitsi.org/

Hello reps,
   The Free Software Foundation (makers of the GNU OS - as in GNU/Linux -
and others) is looking for interns for this summer. I thought my fellow
reps will be interested since the FSF's mission and work aligns to that of
Mozilla - *Freedom to users*.

   The internship is for a duration of 3 months and can be either half day
or full day. You will be working from the FSF office in Boston
(Massachusetts). You will get opportunity to work closely with really cool
people and on great projects.

So if you think you are up for it, you can apply directly at
http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/free-software-advocacy-internships-apply-by-may-15th

If you need any help regarding the matter, please let me know at jsx at fsf.org

Saurabh

A decent netbook will set you back by around 20k. If you are going to use
it for so long in a day, get an extra monitor, keyboard and mouse. Use them
when desk bound.

I've foun such a setup useful even while I use a larger laptop for work.
More screen real estate makes a lot of sense while tailing logs and writing
long docs ;-)

You can still try knocking on the door - worst case they will say no.

I also use Elastix VoIP server; great product.

With a 1 Mbps (symmetric) connection audio is great but video is
unacceptable.  Off hand I don't recall the video codec setup in my
server.

I notice that you mention video calls; what is your WAN bandwidth?

One more thing - I would like to know which one will be better

Openfire (for IM) + Jingle (for voice communication) or
Elastix + Openfire

would like to hear your experience on the above if you have used it which
one will be better and less resource hungry.

Aah, the joys of high bandwidth.   As I said earlier, on our measly 1
Mbps line the video quality was unacceptable.  Google video is jerky
but much better than Elastix.

Dear All,

We have requirement and we need to install a mail server and all the
mailboxes should be readonly meaning the users should not be able to delete
any mails.

They should be able to receive the mails and send the mails but they should
not delete the mails.

We are comfortable with installing mail servers like Postfix, Qmail etc.,
but would like to know if this can be achieved.

POP/IMAP access will also be not given to the users and only webmail will
be given . We may load Squirrelmail, Roundcube etc., for this.

Any pointers will be highly appreciated

Who do you want to prevent deleting emails?

Instead of removing the delete option you should look to a archiving
solution. Search for archive, and mailarchive.

Try zimbra for nice UI.

We give the solutions on mailarchiving also. Look at
www.mailarchiva.comalso for that.

There is a specific reason for asking this question as it is related to an
Organization and they need this sort of feature.

Easiest thing to do then - modify the  web mail front end html pages by removing the delete buttons.

I used to be their customer. I stopped after this change was introduced
about a year or so back. One of their managers did get in touch with me and
promised to resolve it but I never heard back from them.

He is trying to install BCD boot manager on the boot sector. In such cases,
bootloaders like grub and ntldr go to the root partition of their
respective installs. That's the correct way since the selection of which OS
to boot is now handled by the boot manager.
You'd use this strategy for multiple Linux installs too, only one install's
grub goes on MBR, all the other go on the root partition.

I am too late to answer this, though. Would like to know from OP if he
fixed it? I haven't seen this error before. Is he using GRUB2?

The world / india does not need another mark zuckerberg. You be the real
you.

our India have created Tatas, Reliance, Infosys and many biggies....

Learn to accept the people from here rather than importing it.

just that we always brag about the products / people from west and forget
our own people.

our people have stopped knowing our own history. only then, we know how
good we are.

the spirit of entrepreneurship is in getting things done.

are you ready for that?

Hey all,

As you all might be knowing, earlier last month we opened a thread introducing Open Weekends - an initiative to bring all the OSS and tech communities in Chennai together in one place for us to learn and share.

And thanks to all who helped it shape up and now its finally happening!

The last weekend of this month - on the 25th and 26th, Open Weekends will take place at the ThoughtWorks campus, Chennai. Wikipedia, Mozilla and Open Stack communities in Chennai will be participating this time.

The first day is for talks and sessions and hackathons will happen the second day. The detailed schedule and agenda of the event will be let out shortly. But, for now if someone wants to give a talk about anything related to open source, web technologies and anything else related to tech, please email me directly with your name, contact number, topic (with abstract) and duration.

Thanks !

Why not try rsync and cron the job? Saves copying in mod if I Redon files everyday.

I don't mind helping people with difficult problems, but this is an easy
one.
Learn to use Google, my friend.

Here's a hint: Google for "CGI" and "shell script"

My suggestion is to abandon shell scripting altogether, and learn Perl.
Perl is much more sophisticated!
With modules like CGI.pm ( ancient, elegant, robust ) Perl is better suited
for web programming than shell.

Cheers,

Normally a HTML form sends the data to a URL by GET or POST methods.
There will be server-side code to handle the incoming data, validate
it and if it is valid do some operation with it. So you have to write
all the logic of sanitizing the input and calling the shell script in
the server-side code in your favourite language (PHP, Python, Ruby,
Perl, Java and etc.). It is not a good idea to blindly trust the
client-side input data and perform operations on it, hence validation
and sanitization are required.

I have several MBA's in my family.
They all have jobs for big, stable corporations.
I like to tease such MBA's, saying they should really be called SBA's (
Slaves of Business Administration ).
I can only hope MBA's join big companies, hoping to learn complex systems,
and eventually start their own companies.

In the office of a start-up, I saw a painting in the interview room.
It was the picture of a huge rocket on its launchpad, pointed at the stars.
At the bottom of the rocket, was a tiny human figure.
If you looked closely, this tiny human had strapped himself/herself to the
huge rocket.
I joined this start-up, and worked for several others too.
That painting still explains enterprise to me.

Getting a stable job is a viable life strategy.
Entrepreneurs are insane people who want money.
Because "eccentric" = "insane" + "money"

If you are not insane, don't start a company.
Without insane passion, maybe you will turn out some mediocre
product/service.
Most likely, you will fail. It's not worth it.

If you are insanely passionate however, you will enjoy the journey and
learn from it.

Short answer no.

The Free software eco system (lic.) allows people to explore
creativity and innovate.
Otherwise, we would not have had openwrt, zeroshell, voyage linux,
knoppix, system rescue cd, backtrack, ipcop/ipfire ...

Crontabs are hard to get right.

So use logger(1) to test whether cron is doing its job.

Then use these commands.

What you are doing wrong:

1.   You posted a similar query earlier and did not reveal much in
that discussion.
      ref: <http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2013-May/076486.html>

2.  In the above discussion you did not read the replies to your
questions very carefully [a]

3.  People asked you to post specifics in that discussion but you did not.

[a] Read my response posted earlier
<http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2013-May/076497.html>

Notice I mention the '%' character in crontab entries.   You also have
'%' char entries in your crontab they need to be escaped  like so \%.
(man 5 crontab)

Had you shared the crontab entries in your first discussion and also
read the replies more carefully, your problem would have been solved
much sooner.

Hi All
Try out  SOGO "http://www.sogo.nu/", an alternative for Zimbra and Exchange
It supports MAPI natively
It is from the company inverse "http://www.inverse.ca" .  and it is open source

Now inverse is the same company behind packet fense
It is worth trying out.

Hi,

I m a beginner of php

i m tried to send email with another persons, using mail() functions.

but mail cannot be send.

I have change SMTP path in php.ini file

[mail function]
; For Win32 only.
; http://php.net/smtp
SMTP = localhost
; http://php.net/smtp-port
smtp_port = 25

; For Win32 only.
; http://php.net/sendmail-from
sendmail_from = vijaysiva5555 at gmail.com

; For Unix only.  You may supply arguments as well (default: "sendmail -t
-i").
; http://php.net/sendmail-path
sendmail_path =/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i

; Force the addition of the specified parameters to be passed as extra
parameters
; to the sendmail binary. These parameters will always replace the value of
; the 5th parameter to mail(), even in safe mode.
;mail.force_extra_parameters =

; Add X-PHP-Originating-Script: that will include uid of the script
followed by the filename
mail.add_x_header = On

; Log all mail() calls including the full path of the script, line #, to
address and headers
;mail.log =

 but mail cannot be send.

now wat can i do?

please any one tell me.........

Best way of crontab edit is

$ sudo crontab -e

please verify your default editor before run this command.

Your entry will be made in crontab, if it is right.

If you are going to add script, then test it before adding to crontab.

This just in - DuckDuckGo fires up their own XMPP service:
https://dukgo.com/blog/xmpp-services-at-duckduckgo

DuckDuckGo seems both willing and able to offer a viable, privacy-friendly
alternative to Google, and I am very happy to see they are also seizing the
moment to roll out another service and try to challenge Google on yet another
market.

Talk 1: Py-notify
by Kausikram

  Py-notify  is a Python  package  providing  tools  for  implementing
  Observer   programming   pattern.   These  tools  include   signals,
  conditions and variables.

  Signals  are  lists of  handlers  that are  called  when  signal  is
  emitted.  Conditions are basically  boolean variables coupled with a
  signal that is emitted when  condition  state  changes.  They can be
  combined  using  standard  logical  operators  (not, and, etc.) into
  compound  conditions.  Variables,  unlike  conditions,  can hold any
  Python  object, not just  booleans,  but they cannot be combined.

  -- http://home.gna.org/py-notify/

Talk 2: Pexpect and pxssh
by Rengaraj

  Pexpect is a pure Python  module that makes Python a better tool for
  controlling and automating other programs. Pexpect is similar to the
  Don Libes `Expect` system, but Pexpect as a different interface that
  is easier to  understand.  Pexpect is  basically a pattern  matching
  system. It runs programs and watches  output. When output  matches a
  given  pattern  Pexpect  can  respond  as  if a  human  were  typing
  responses.  Pexpect can be used for automation,  testing, and screen
  scraping.  Pexpect can be used for  automating  interactive  console
  applications   such   as  ssh,   ftp,   passwd,   telnet,   etc.

  -- http://www.noah.org/wiki/pexpect

If you would like to give a talk, just come  prepared, we will be able
to accommodate you.

If you are new to Python, the  tutorial  "Learn  Python in 10 Minutes"
http://www.korokithakis.net/tutorials/python/  will  give  you a quick
overview of what Python is all about.

Regards,
Vijay

Here are few things that comes to my mind.

1. Make sure your sendmail works by sending some mail directly using
sendmail.

2. Is this linux ? in that case you can see if the local mail are recived,
if a local email is configured.

3. Using a gmail account in the from might cause problems or will send the
mail to your junk folder. Try changing it.

4. Enable log "mail.log" and see what it has to say.

 Rgds,
Siva.

Hi

Is some one facing the same problem as I am,  I am using Firefox 21.
When I try to compose a new email over gmail on their web interface, I
am unable to CTRL+C or CTRL+V,  However if I right click I can see the
copy and paste option.

The CTRL+C works fine when I am trying to view an email.

About OpenStack:
OpenStack is a python based open source cloud computing framework.

It is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing project
that is free open
source software released under the terms of the Apache License. The
project is managed by
the OpenStack Foundation, a non-profit corporate entity established in
September 2012 to promote, protect and empower OpenStack software and
its community.

More than 150 companies have joined the project among which are AMD,
Intel, Canonical,
SUSE Linux, Red Hat, Cisco, Dell, HP, IBM, NEC, VMware and Yahoo!.
It is portable software, but is mostly developed and used on the Linux
operating system.

The technology consists of a series of interrelated projects that
control large pools
of processing, storage, and networking resources throughout a
datacenter, all managed
through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering
their users to
provision resources through a web interface.

Yes. Tally ERP 9 can be used via wine. But the application will be
sluggish. 

These things are necessary in order to run Tally using wine.
     1. Re-define certain shortcut keys in Gnome, such as Alt+F2, as
        this key is used for changing the current accounting period in
        Tally.
     2. There should be a valid active network connection otherwise
        Tally will complain ODBC connection failed error.
     3. Tally will maintain company records in "drive:\<tally dir>\data
        \", this directory should exist and have write permissions. The
        drive could be "C:\" or "D:\", so check and fix the wine
        settings for it. Otherwise you will get error something like
        "Too many companies can't open..." (forgot the exact error I
        got)
     4. To reduce sluggishness, ask them to use shortcut keys for
        selecting a menu item instead of navigating them via arrow
        keys.

[0] when you announce something that reads like a competition, it
would nice to link to T&C
[1] why is the word "perks" used? It usually means "Money, goods, or
other benefit to which one is entitled as an employee or as a
shareholder of a company"

Message-ID: <CALDskyzBcioU1PXd0mC35zKZPhrx7G44vZH15C+qV8xsgC4yEw@mail.gmail.com>

I use some of the download accelerators that can help you to get more
bandwidth in a crowded LAN.

1) aget
2) axel
3) lftp with pget or -P


For upload there are no accelerators. I use curl to do FTP uploads.
scp is also used or rsync is used.

Download accelerators work by using multiple TCP connections that
obtain extra bandwidth at the cost
 of other local users.

But it obviously cannot get more bandwidth than what your WAN gives.

Not all HTTP and FTP servers allow multiple connections but many do in
my experience.

A file is fetched portion by portion in each connection and then assembled.

It is complicated coding.

And p2p protocols like bittorrent or gnutella have this ability
automatically but it also uploads whilst downloading.

If your firewall does QoS to allow bandwidth for important skype video
then you may not be able to circumvent it.

Can you please name at least one open source package for http and ftp.
  I realize for normal web browsing this is possible but for
downloading an iso file how does it work?

It does. Though the user and application side can change for any distros(or
even Android), the kernel and the device driver remains same.
What I suggest take a vanilla kernel(for Ubuntu check this link
http://lwn.net/Articles/321473/). Then apply patches to see, if newer
versions work

I am trying to build a low cost computer which runs open source educational
software (edubuntu).
The cost of the Raspberry Pi is around 3k. I don't know whether it works
with ubuntu out of box.

(or) Any other embedded board works with ubuntu, cost should be similar to
raspberry Pi.

Thanks for sharing your views.

Thanks

I have implemented a Web based SMS Management System using Gammu and Kalkun
(http://wammu.eu) running on Fedora-18 Remix customized for Raspberry Pi
(now all my SMS messages are sent from / received by Raspberry Pi).

I am planning to demo this in the forthcoming ILUG-C meet.

aria2c does http, torrents and ftp. Prozilla also does both hhtp and
ftp but has been dormant for a long time.

But these are clients.

After Baskar's post, I checked prozilla but the original site's domain
does not exist any longer.

aria2c - curl can do something similar for http/ftp.  It's man page
says it accepts multiple sites which would something similar to aria2c
but I have not tried it.

However, my original query - what server side apps. support breaking
up the file into small bits such that clients like above can make
multiple (parallel) connections to retrieve the bits and assemble the
file on the client end.

Would appreciate if anyone could enlighten us on how it works on the
server side.

In Debian, jigdo assembles the ISO file from the list of package
content for that specific file.  There is also zsync which I think
works in a similar to jigdo.

IMO,  the last mile bandwidth is the weakest link.  I have not seen
any significant efficiency gains in the time for the 700MB odd ISO
files.

Was not clear earlier that you were asking for server side.

Going by the features on the front end, it seems like the segments
start from an different offset of the original file. We can use any
number of segments/threads and the segments get equally split. This is
what leads me to deduce this. This is also possible if the file is
broken into many segments to give us a semblance of this behaviour.

Hi,
there are a few boards built around Alwinner A10 like cubieboard (which has
already been mentionaed), marsboard, Olimex olinuxino A10(and also A13 and
A20) and you may find others too.
A10 has VGA output, but none of the boards I have seen have given VGA out,
which you might
want to keep the costs low, since the other option is HDMI/LCD interface.
If you don't have a
problem with HDMI, then you even go for android TV sticks(like from
miniand), most of them
will be able to run a desktop distro. I think beaglebone black is also a
good option.

I agree Tavish i had a taught of getting beagle bone black for an instance
but dropped it on context of HDMi interface.. no Display means end to game
for android developers and all Rpi does not support Ubuntu distro.

Still on search for availability of a good board for all round linux
development at low cost**.

HDMI to VGA convertors are available. In some forums (for samsung
exynos based development board) people have responded positively on
using those convertors. You can try them - I have not used them
personally. HDMI to VGA convertors that needs power supply from mains
seems working based on the forums. I read these info a couple of
months back. Searching on web will land you there.

I am also trying to get a cheap device to use instead of a PC. Devices
with 2GB RAM, dual / quad core ARM 1.5+ GHz processor, OpenGL ES 2
capable GPU are available (see http://liliputing.com/tag/mini-pc) for
less than 100$. Many devices support Android natively. Ubuntu in those
devices lack graphics acceleration so opening / moving windows may lag
- things are moving fast with lima open source graphics driver so
hoping for the best to happen soon.

Hope this helps,
Prasanna Kumar

Message-ID: <CALDskyyb8x80Hij3zUhM8cqHf1=mm-5JNyEZn76oN5UVmt3h=g@mail.gmail.com>

In today's world only knowledge counts.

If you have knowledge by virtue of experience and suffering then you can
 internalize lot more knowledge. By starting small you can get momentum
 and move up, little by little and make giant leaps in time.

But if you wish to sit on the periphery and measure the depth with your feet
 then you will always be a loser.

Being a loser is a very usual ordinary and common thing in India. To not have
 ability and hard work and a thirst for knowledge is very common...here. But
 that is not the way the world works.

A lot of the companies I worked for in IITM and came across in Chennai
are interested
 in selling to Indian govt, or to Africa or South America or to colleges.

Why?

Or they want to be involved with colleges in some manner.

Why?

Answer is very simple.

They want to stay a loser all their lives and play with weak fools.

This approach has multiple problems. Failure is guaranteed. But along
 with that as I always find you will not have money to continue running the
 business.

And from my experience India is not the market for IT. But for movies, cricket,
 entertainment, jewelry and so on India is great. You can tap into the
disposable
income and rise in the purchasing power of many metros.

If you do anything at all in the world of technology, be it by way of
software or
 hardware or again software(software is bigger than everything else),
then focus on
 the entire world.

In particular look at the most happening place, the USA or Europe or
Australia or Japan.

The developed markets will reward you for doing a good job and pay you
easily and correctly.

It is truly remarkable how having spent all my life in India and
having never studied abroad
 I am so different from others....

I used to imagine for a long time that Indian market does not require
great quality or features, only
 the problem at hand needs to be solved. But I was proven wrong. After
a painful span of more than
 2 years. People don't treat you properly, they won't pay(many do) and
decisions never get made.

Instead one is much better off focusing on the entire worldwide market
and using Internet as the
 delivery medium for your product or service and also deliver support.

By staying away from other Indians who will pull you down by way of
their weak womanly thinking,
 by teaching you to adopt bad methods like bribery, cheating, not
winning by fairness or quality,
 you will get polluted and lose the charm of doing the knowledge business.

The true mark of a successful man is total lack of fear when you see a
similar businessman or
 someone who is doing something like you. If you have real worth
nobody can steal your bread.

Out of the people I have met in India all my life 7 out of 10 people
are mortally afflicted by fear
 of someone else stealing their cake. This seems to be a really normal
thing in India, but I don't think
 this is normal around the world.

As I said stay focused on learning and keep updating yourself
continuously, keep improving
 continuously.

It is best to stay away from other colleagues and friends who hate you
because you are not weak like them.

That is fine. Live with it. Your best friend if knowledge, not your
friends. Trust me. I am not lying.

-Girish

Dear Girish,

There is some truth in what you said.

However, I disagree with you on many points.

1. Women: If you really think that women are "weak", then you need to
revise your thinking, my friend.

2. Fear: Courage is not the absence of fear. It is functioning, despite fear.

3. Money: Let's say that you succeed, and become the most
knowledgable, wealthiest person in the world. Yet, you have left
behind friendship. Is that really a kind of success worth having? You
turn into King Midas. You can't trust a simple smile. You can't hold
an extended handshake of friendship.

Sorry, but I don't want to be this kind of macho superman.
I would rather be a weak loser, and have friends.
The whole point of knowledge is happiness, not money, or even knowledge itself.

Cheers,

- Ashwin.

Dear Girish,

As always - you speak very clearly (atleast as of your conviction) and
boldly - though it is sometimes not needed.  I do not know what prompted
you on this clear, bold and sudden expression of your point / view.

As always - all of you are afraid of being :

-  loser (or not being a winner)
-  fear (of losing things which are with you - to someone else)
-  indian people (generally) and indian companies
-  more of materialistic only

MAYBE I am COMPLETELY WRONG, I admit.

There is nothing wrong being / living till your last breath as a loser.  It
is a relative term as to the time of relation, I too have seen many of my
school mates were a sorry loser - who have failed to clear even simple
exams, failed 10th / 12th / graduation.  But, after seeing them after 15
years - some of them have become top class - at least in terms of being a
successful person - in your terms - not afraid of someone stealing their
bread / not afraid of working with some of the top class companies (right
from IBM to TVS to simple Saravana Bhavan vendor etc).

Fear -  of losing things :  you will always lose things (in substitution -
say play time to study time etc) when you are not sure of getting to be
where you want to be. After all FEAR makes you to look for alternatives
(the degree of appropriateness of the solution will depend on more of your
Manam / Buddhi / Chinda & Agna), which you will not get when you are too
confident. May be you will get a better outcome if you have still operated
when you were still under fear. Not getting bogged down by Fear is the only
answer.

Indian People & Companies :  First of all in my opinion - all companies /
Org etc - is only as good as its staff.  If Indian companies are bad, then
the Indian staff are bad.  Is any other countries people are better than
Indian ???  Each country has always had a very very bad phase - which
happens primarily because of their citizens.  Do not consider IPL /
Congress / and other issues which plague India right now.

Materilism :  I think you know more about this than others to tell you, you
were always a good dasa of lord Muruga !!!.  Think about it, and if
something needs to change your / my view please let me know.

I think the time one lives is always the best time (to live / to prosper),
since, when we die, we cannot do anything - being a loser / successful
person.

The above are my views.

with warm regards

With due respect to your knowledgeable comments on this thread ....

Hi All,
          We are loosely connected people who form this virtual space
called ILUG-C mailing list , some of us sound like broken record from time
and time again to keep the sanity of certain conversations going and
pointing at people as a group towards mailing list  guidelines, sometimes
they are heard sometimes they are not ,sometimes these are taken on
a personal level ,  sometimes they are argued till death like small kids
who fight saying my chocolate is better than yours. I think in order to
keep sanity of such a diverse group and keep the discussions on topic ,
educating the new members the ways of this list if our joint
group responsibility , I agree as there are more people joining they do not
know that there can be  certain written rules to the existence and basis of
this community. which has been listed here
http://ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines/

i propose the list maintainers to add this line
http://ilugc.in/mailinglist-guidelines/ at the end of every mail that goes
out of this mailing list ,so that people cannot escape with an excuse that
they did not know about it .

IIRC, this is sent to the member when s/he joins this mailing list.
IMO, *the*  problem is that the member does *not* bother to read it.

And there are members who blatantly and intentionally don't follow the
guidelines just because they believe they're above it and want to
prove their point. Not sure how to deal with such people. I welcome
the idea of mentioning the mailing list guidelines link in the footer
of each email, but I am very skeptic about it encouraging more people
to read and follow the guidelines.

My 2 paisa on this discussion.

Thanks & Regards,
Guruprasad

I agree with this in context of such a step would increase awareness
about the guidelines. Adhering to them is another matter and, has
always been a point of contention over the years that I've been on
various lists. There was a corridor discussion at GNUnify (~2 years
back) about the utility of turning the guidelines of mailing lists
into a translation ready piece and then linking to a page with the
guidelines in the various languages. I don't really know if that would
be useful to do.

Fedora 14 has reached its EOL [1]. The OP needs to upgrade to a newer release.

Still fresh from my experience of organizing the Chennai Open Weekends event, there goes my unorthodox version on it :?

Open Weekends, what I see it to be :?

I hope, this definitely gives a great start to the people here at Chennai :)

The Open Weekends is an effort to bring all the open source communities
together to have meetups and hackathons.

We had our first event at May 26, 26.

We got talks about Fedora, Antlr4, openstack, wordpress, wikipedia,
mozilla projects,
firefox os, photography etc.

Hackathons for wikipedia and firefox os for the second day.


The event went very well. About 70-80 people from various open source /
open content communities attended the sessions over two days.

A special shout out to Dwarak and team of Mozilla India, for making this
excellent event happen. We hope to have more such open weekend events in
Chennai regularly.

First of all - follow list guidelines and do *not* top post.   It
really messes up the line of thought.   Also trim your message to the
relevant lines only.

Top posting may be acceptable in business emails but for technical
discussions inter-leaved style is the best.

It is *not* a good idea to continue using a product that is EoL.
That is what Shakti was telling you, indirectly it meant migrate to
the latest Fedora release.

>From your response, it looks like you do not want to upgrade.

In that case, migrate to another distribution that has long term
support; options are (a) Debian Wheezy, (b) Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (c)
CentOS 6.
