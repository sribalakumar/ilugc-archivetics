Mano,

Good point. Don't forget, "Necessity is the mother of invention".

ICT is felt today as a necessity and hence it has been invented.

If there is a will, there can be a way. We can find genuine solutions to
genuie problems and make the world, a better place to live for all.

Why use science and technology to make life more unhappy and kill ourselves.


The rural / tribal scientist could predict better than our Ph.D.s about
Tsunami and earthquakes!! The sad part is none were ready to listen to them,
as they had no paper qualification and high positions to back them!!

well...just a comparison between $2^32$ and $2^64$ will show you how
far into the future that is... perhaps too far off for the current
codebase to exist! well... u can have other representations, but
efficiency too is a major factor in any design!

Dear friends,

Warm greets, The patient got the blood now,I still want to add something
here for some peculiar variety of blood to source it in untime. It is a good
presence of mind of one of our friend to approach the IT & ITES companies
and source the blood in untime .  Huge hunt of sourcing the blood in
known/referred blood bank gone in vain, Our friend approached all the
IT/ITES Company  in South chennai. With gods grace thinks went smooth and we
got the blood. If some one  faces similiar problem refer
www.bharatbloodbank.com may be a cushion for searching the blood.

Thank you,

Cheers

Try reconfiguring your xorg , and it will only auto detect changes and
everything , but do a backup of your existing xorg.conf, and see what it has
detected and written to the generated xorg.conf, replaces sections whic you
think are correct in your old xorg.conf and it will run fine.

While the answer to your question depends on what SATA controller your
MotherBoard  uses, you  should  be good  to  go with  a fairly  recent
kernel.  My  debian 'sarge'  installer CD worked  like a charm  when I
booted the installer with a 2.6 kernel.

redhat 9.0 is nearly 4 years old. I would suggest trying with an 
uptodate distro

I don't think Redhat Linux 9 which is quite old, supports SATA disks.
Try a more recent version like Fedora Core4.

1. SATA Support is very much available with these distributions. You can 
try one of these.
SUSE Linux 9.3 and later's installation kernel, Fedora Core 3 and 
later's, CentOS 4.1 and later's, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and later, 
Gentoo Linux 2004.3 and later's, Knoppix 3.7 and later's, Debian 
3.1/sarge and later's (especially when started with the "bf2.6 boot 
flavour" boot image), Slackware 10.2 w/test26.s boot option, Xandros 
Desktop OS 3.0 and later's, Ubuntu (or Kubuntu) Linux 5.04 "hoary 
hedgehog" and later's, Vector Linux 5.1 and later's, Libranet 3.0 and 
later's, MEPIS Linux 3.3.1 and later's, Kanotix 2005-03 and later's, 
Linspire 5.0 and later's, PCLinux OS preview .81 and later's, 
ArkLinux's, and Mandriva Linux 2005 (Courtesy: 
http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Hardware/sata.html)

2.If you are keen on Redhat 9, Another option is change the IDE mode as 
"Legacy" in your bios. Now Red hat 9.0 will get installed. Its default 
kernel is 2.4.20 (this version does not have SATA support). Download the 
kernel source 2.4.27 or later (which has SATA support) - build and 
install this kernel. Before rebooting change back the IDE mode as SATA 
in your bios. (Hope your motherboard bios has SATA support). Now your 
hdd will be in SATA way.

You should make changes in the BIOS and set IDE compatible flags (or
something similar). I faced same problem long back and got the work
around in this fashion. But, wise option is to go for recent
distribution with 2.6 kernel though.

Redhat 9 is too old. Try newer version like Fedora-3/Fedora-4

I had similar problem while trying to install debian
(kernel 2.4)
on my SATA hdd. When I chose kernel 2.6, it was a
breeze.
Try using kernel 2.6

Where The Mind is Without Fear
-Rabindranath Tagore

Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
Where knowledge is free
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
By narrow domestic walls
Where words come out from the depth of truth
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
Where the mind is led forward by thee
Into ever-widening thought and action
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake

There was an occasion for me to quote the poem by Tagore on an issue
touching schools at:
http://mm.gnu.org.in/pipermail/fsf-friends/2004-September/002281.html

The thing that has changed since then is that Linus and his friends have
started demanding license fees for using the alleged "linux" trademark.
Those activities are leashed out from www.linuxmark.org   "Linux" is both
the name of a kernel released under the GPL and also the name by which GNU
operating system has been called when run with the said kernel.  "Linux" is
a generic name and distributors and service providers are free to use it as
part of their names, and it has been freely used by many as such for many
years. Though the claim that the word "linux" is a trademark is untenable,
these activities are a big blow to the spirit of of free software. It is
ridiculous to hold the idea that "linux" is "free" - as long its so called
"owner" demands a "fee" for merely using "linux" as part of product names or
labels.   There are many ways to make $money with free software, but this is
not one of them.  Thousands of others have contributed to the development of
the "linux" kernel, and no single person can hold it to ransom.  In this
situation, the OT tag used by Mohammed Riyaz is correct so far as this list
is concerned :(

Message-ID: <439132FF.8030804@gmail.com>

Milk in the US is genetically modified and contains rBGH which increases
cancer risks.
http://www.preventcancer.com/consumers/general/milk.htm
It appears only milk and milk products clearly labeled "NO rBGH" are
without this risk. Care and caution is necessary in respect of
chocolates, butter and cheese imported from the U.S.  Europe, Canada and
others have banned research or use of rBGH in their countries.

It also involves the unethical and cruel procedure of injecting rBGH
into cows, that many cows suffer enlargement of the udder and mastitis,
producing milk with pus. Apart from this being atrociously cruel to the
cows, it is totally inhuman to subject children, who may consume atleast
two glasses of milk daily, to this grave risk.  The Monsanto Monster
should be stopped.

Yes, I have already downloaded the examples. Started working on 
Digital/Analog I/O Device Driver. I am designing a Hardware device which 
can serve as Digital I/O and Analog Output for learning purpose. 
Studying the Digital I/O device access examples in the book. I have 
proposed to write a device driver and user library for this new 
hardware. Once it is done, I want to share my experience through ILUGC.

Message-ID: <BAY110-F2FC1860555DEE626B13309B4F0@phx.gbl>


Hello ppl,

Atlast I have my hathway netg working fine. But I am not able to reason out 
the following wierd phenonmenon. Someone explain.

When I reboot my notebook, the network doesnt get up automatically. I would 
have to go to yast and reconfigure. Also after configuring with yast the gw  
does not get setup properly so i hve to manually add the gw. One more wierd 
thing is that if I straight away type 'route add default gw <ip addr>' it 
says network unreachable. If I type 'route add default gw <my static ip>' 
and then add the gw it works. After which i delete the former route. Funny 
na.. then my net works extrmely gr888..

Also during reboot or relogin, if I dont reconfigure using yast and straight 
away add the route the net is damn slow!!! I figured all this by trial and 
error. Cud anyone explain or solve this phenonmenon for me.

My next blog would be on FOSS.in 2005. I had been there for 2 days.

Ciao,
Aanjhan

Because your settings are not persistent.

A simple thing to do would be to add your
configuration commands like:

ifconfig eth0 <ip>
route add default gw <ip> 

to any of your startup scripts in /etc/init.d so
everytime on boot, it gets configured.

Also, publish it online. So, students from different
parts of the country can learn from your experience.

Hi all,

I have a PC (Celeron 900MHz,40GB HDD, 128 MB RAM) in dual boot (Win98,

i want to transfer images from my Sony Ericsson k300i mobile to PC. What is

In SonyEricsson website, Synchronization software is there only for OS of

Can anybody give some useful pointers?

Message-ID: <20051204070234.28830.qmail@web54508.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi
 
My system is having MDK 10.1 and Windows XP multibooting with Grub (installed in mbr). 
It is working fine. The System config is Intel PIII 937MHz, 815E MB, 256 MB RAM, 40 GB 
HDD.
 
Now I would like to empty the existing 10 GB FAT32 partition and install ubuntu 5.10 
there. Is it OK if I follow the following the steps.
 
1. Selecting the (E: FAT32) for the installation of Ubuntu and show the MDK swap  
partition for swap (Hope ubuntu and MDK can share the same swap space)
2. Finishing the installation without installing Grub
3. Rebooting the system and editing the menu.lst file with appropirate entries to boot 
into Ubuntu.
 
I know the following lines needs to be modified and added in menu.lst file.

title linux (ubuntu)
kernel (hd0,2)/boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/hda3 acpi=ht resume=/dev/hda7 vga=791
initrd (hd0,2)/boot/initrd.img
 
But confused. Will someone in the group check and suggest me the exact changes which I 
have to make in the lines below? I have appended the existing etc/fstab and meun.lst 
listings to verify.

Thanks.
 
R.Dhanagopal
 
 
HDD is partitioned as below:
 C: 10 GB NTFS Where XP is installed

googling wouldn't help you much because unstable, as the name
suggests, is for developers and packagers. unless you know much about
kde, i would suggest you revert to testing or stable.

This group is called the "Indian Linux Users Group Chennai" and does that
mean anyone here is trying to "usurp ownership" of the so called trademark?
"Linux" is a generic word, and anyone distributing or providing any service
connected with the kernel or the OS is free to use it as part of their names
to distinguish themselves from others.  Australia has rightly rejected the
attempt to register "Linux" as a trademark (
http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=11882 )

Anyway, this is totally off topic here, and I'll stop with this.

Best use some distro with a 2.6 kernel. Using RH 9 is like using Windows 95, 
considering the developments we've had since then...

Hmm, this usually happens, if the init script for the desktop
envt/window manager fails or something, it is the failsafe default, so
I guess the upgrade to latest kde broke the init scripts for KDE. The
init scripts are in different places in different distributions, but
common places include /etc/gdm, /etc/X11, etc.

Also, check the .xsession-errors file in ur home directory for clues.

Well, thats my guess anyway! :)

HTH.

What a comparison. RH 9 is still good enough for a lot of people who
run webservers and such on that platform.

In fact, the OP's SATA disk can be made to work on RH9 by someone with
a bit of knowledge and patience - all it probably needs is to build a
2.6 series kernel and a few userland stuff - modutils etc. on RH 9.
Quite likely everything that is needed is already available on
http://www.fedoralegacy.org. Even more likely that the RHEL2.1 kernel
source RPMs (which includes SATA support) can be rebuilt on RH9.

 IE Bug Lets Hackers Phish With Google Desktop
Hacker could scan your hard drive and steal sensitive info.

 Robert McMillan, IDG News Service
Friday, December 02, 2005

A bug in Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser gives phishers a way to scan
the hard drives of Google Desktop users, according to an Israeli hacker.
Because of a flaw in the way IE processes Web pages, a malicious Web site
could use the attack to steal sensitive information like credit card numbers
or passwords from the hard drives of its visitors.

"Google Desktop
<http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,122374,00.asp>users who
use IE are currently completely exposed," wrote hacker Matan
Gillon in an e-mail interview. "An experienced attacker can covertly harvest
their hard drives for sensitive information such as passwords and credit
card numbers. Since Google also indexes e-mails which can be read in the Web
interface itself, it's also possible to access them using this attack."
The Details

Gillon has posted an extensive description of how such an attack would work,
along with a proof of concept exploit, on his
blog<http://www.hacker.co.il/security/ie/css_import.html>
.

The IE bug concerns the way Microsoft's browser processes Web page layout
information using the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) format. The CSS format is
widely used to give Web sites a consistent look and feel, but attackers can
take advantage of the way that IE processes CSS to get Google Desktop to
reveal sensitive information.

Hackers would first need to trick users into visiting a malicious Web site
for the attack to be successful, Gillon says. The attack works with IE 6 and
Google Desktop version 2, and may also work on other versions of Microsoft's
browser, but not on non-Microsoft browsers like Firefox or Opera, he adds.
Turn Off JavaScript

Users can nullify the attack by turning off JavaScript in their browsers,
Gillon says. This can be done by disabling "Active scripting" in IE's
Internet Options menu.
JavaScript<http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,123764,00.asp>is
a popular scripting language used by Web developers to make their
sites
more dynamic.

Users need to be particularly wary of the Web sites they visit these days,
because of another unpatched IE vulnerability that could be used to take
over a user's PC. Hackers posted sample code that exploited this problem
over a week ago, and Microsoft said that hackers are already using the code
in attacks. As with the new CSS problem, users must first be tricked into
visiting a malicious Web site for this IE bug to be exploited.

Some security experts believe that Microsoft is in the process of rushing
out a patch to fix this problem before these attacks become more widespread.
These attacks can also be avoided by disabling JavaScript in IE, or by using
an alternative browser.

Microsoft executives were unavailable to comment on the CSS bug, but a
spokeswoman for the company's public relations agency said the issue is

It is ***better to install grub on Ubuntu root partition*** (/dev/hda3 
in your case). After reboot, you can boot to MDK. Take the entry of 
Ubuntu in menu.lst of ubuntu partition and append it with the menu.lst 
of MDK. It is better to take the kernel argument set by distributor, 
since they customize the kernel.

Press Ctrl+Alt+Backspace while you are in terminal window of kde. You

While the answer to your question depends on what SATA controller your
MotherBoard uses, you should be good to go with a fairly recent
kernel. My debian 'sarge' installer CD worked like a charm when I
booted the installer with a 2.6 kernel.

as root, use

update-alternatives --config x-session-manager   and
update-alternatives --config x-window-manager

it should give you a list of alternatives... select the appropriate
gnome program

Had a quick looksee in the linuxmark.org website. From what I gather,
ILUGC or anyone else  (even commercial entities earning less than
USD50K per annum) do not have to pay anything. They only have to
attribute the linux trademark to the relevant owners.

 Australia has rightly rejected the

Am sure it cost money to defend the status quo in Australia. Who pays
for it? I think linuxmark.org is a reasonable solution to this problem
- if you make a lot of money then pay us an amt so we can use it to
ward off threats.

Revisiting the discussion on BLUG being hijacked and controls in place
for chennailug, what stops someone from registering chennailug as a
society (without chennailug.org knowing it?). Even if it will be
untenable in a court and the society can be declared illegal, who will
pay for the costs to get such a judgement?

regds,
mano

Debian Sid would have Xorg. So it would be 'dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'

Lot more painful to do that and keep such a system upto date, than
just installing a distro built around 2.6, I think... Point I'm making
is that if you're not experienced enough to do that much maintainence,
RH9 is not worth the trouble...

Hi all, 

I have made a PCI base serail ATA drive work with linux-2.6 series!
Just check if that helps and yes 2.6 kernel is best to make sata work
instead of 2.4 series comes with redhat 9!


FY!
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This PCI Serai ATA host controller card support for linux is available
in most of the latest kernel release. 


Step 1) Make a kernel image that support PCI Serial ATA controller.
Vendor : Silicon Image


Configure a fresh linux-2.6.12.tar.gz kernel and adding this few options
should enable the should make the kernel recognize the IDE controller
card when we plug into PCI slot of your standalone PC or other board.


#tar -xvzf linux-2.6.12.tar.gz

#cdlinux-2.6.12

#make menuconfig


Device Drivers --->

SCSI device support --->

<M> SCSI device support

[*] legacy /proc/scsi/ support

--- SCSI support type (disk, tape, CD-ROM)

<M> SCSI disk support

<M> SCSI tape support

<M> SCSI OnStream SC-x0 tape support

<M> SCSI CDROM support

[*] Enable vendor-specific extensions (for SCSI CDROM)

<M> SCSI generic support

[*] Verbose SCSI error reporting (kernel size +=12K)

[*] SCSI logging facility

SCSI Transport Attributes --->

SCSI low-level drivers --->

[*] Serial ATA (SATA) support

<M> AHCI SATA support

<M> ServerWorks Frodo / Apple K2 SATA support

<M> Intel PIIX/ICH SATA suppor

<M> Promise SATA SX4 support

<M> Silicon Image SATA support 

File systems---->

<*> Second extended fs support 

[*] Ext2 extended attributes 

[*] Ext2 POSIX Access Control Lists 

[*] Ext2 Security Labels 

<M> Ext3 journalling file system support 

[*] Ext3 extended attributes 

[*] Ext3 POSIX Access Control Lists 

[ ] Ext3 Security Labels 

[*] JBD (ext3) debugging support

DOS/FAT/NT Filesystems --->

M> MSDOS fs support 

<M> VFAT (Windows-95) fs support 

(437) Default codepage for FAT 

(iso8859-1) Default iocharset for FAT 

<M> NTFS file system support




Save the configuration and build the image as:

#make bzImage

#make modules;

#make modules_install

#make install

#lilo


Step 2) Shutdown the machine and make sure power is OFF.


Step 3) Installing the Serial ATA controller card into your PC.


a) Align the Serai ATA controller card w.r.tPCI slot and insert it.

b) connect to the sata connector of Serial ATA controller cable to the
SATA hard disk.

c) connect the power supply from PC ( with SATA pluggins from the Vendor
that can be used with 

default SMPS we have in PC) to the SATA hard disk.


Step 4) Start Power ON to the PC and Boot form the new kernel
image(2.6.12) that 

we have built. Once the PC is booted with new kernel.


Step 5) Driver installations:

#modprobe scsi

#modprobe sd_mod

#modprobe dm_mod

#modprobe sg

#modprobe st

#modprobe ide-scsi

#modprobe libata

#modprobe sata_sil /* This is the main driver for us to have access to
SATA disk


#

#fdisk -l 

This will show the disk partion of your local PC and the external IDE
hard disk drive that we have installed. This is what it shows for my PC:


Disk /dev/hda: 40.0 GB, 40020664320 bytes

255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 4865 cylinders

Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes


Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System

/dev/hda10 4447 4697 2016126 83 Linux

/dev/hda11 4698 4763 530113+ 82 Linux swap

/dev/hda12 4764 4814 409626 83 Linux

/dev/hda13 4815 4865 409626 83 Linux


Disk /dev/sda: 251.0 GB, 251000193024 bytes

255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 30515 cylinders

Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes


Disk /dev/sda doesn't contain a valid partition table

Note: This is a new disk wit no data in any format. Else all the
partition of the disk will show up.




Step 6) Accessing the new STAT hard drive.


#mkdir test

#modprobe ext3

#modporbe ext2

#modprobe msdos

#modprebe ntfs


#mount /dev/sda* test/


So all contains in /dev/sda* are there in test.



Here what minimimal needs to be selected to make Serial ATA controller
work on board:

Or, you can just hard compile the required drivers, instead of messing
with modules... ;-)

This will help you to find/identify exactly what you require. 
I always prefer to build as loadable module.  You may use hard compile
to avoid any of these steps at the end.

Hi,

It must be the mp3 licensing issue.. I had the same problem.. Solution is

Add libmpg123.so in the directory /usr/lib/xmms/Input/

It works after that..

I have the file.. May be I can mail you if neccessary!!

The following folks wanted to give talks:

1. Kris Dev (LL2B): company introduction, their work
on FLOSS etc.

2. Deepan Chakravarthy: Makefiles, Perl tutorial?

3. Prashanth Mohan (CSE, Anna Univ): (If he has
returned from Pune). Talk is on PGP/GPG ?

Do contact Bharathi if the place and time suits you.
Else we can schedule your talks during any other
weekend.

Thanks,

SK

No tribute in payable to anyone for using generic names.  There are

"Linux" is a generic word and the attempt in Australia was to change 
that status quo, and the Australian authorities have ruled in favour of 
public interest.

"ILUGC" is a mark used by this list for a long time and anyone 
infringing it would be doing so at their own risk.  Any new fsug with a 
reasonable amount of sense would avoid using any pre-existing marks.  
There is no need to worry about marks owned by reputed institutions 
which are capable of taking care of their interests.

(Windows programmers out there might also recognize it as the basis for the CTime and CTimeSpan classes in MFC.)   time_t is actually just an integer (a whole number), that counts the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 at 12:00 AM Greenwich Mean Time. A time_t value of 0 would be 12:00:00 AM (exactly midnight) 1-Jan-1970, a time_t value of 1   would be 12:00:01 AM  (one second after midnight) 1-Jan-1970, etc..   some example times and their exact time_t representations:   Date & time     time_t representation   1-Jan-1970,     12:00:00 AM GMT 0   1-Jan-1970,     12:01:00 AM GMT 60   1-Jan-1970,     01:00:00 AM GMT 3 600   2-Jan-1970,     12:00:00 AM GMT 86 400   1-Jan-1971,     12:00:00 AM GMT 31 536 000   1-Jan-1972,     12:00:00 AM GMT 63 072 000   1-Jan-2038,     12:00:00 AM GMT 2 145 916 800   19-Jan-2038,    03:14:07 AM GMT 2 147 483 647   By the year 2038,

The First of these bits is used for the positive/negative sign of the integer, while the remaining 31 bits are used to store the number itself.   The highest number these 31 data bits can store works out to exactly 2147 483 647.   A time_t value of this exact number, 2 147 483 647, represents January 19,2038, at 7 seconds past 3:14 AM Greenwich Mean Time. So, at 3:14:07 AM GMT on that fateful day, every time_t used in a 32-bit C or C++ program will reach its upper limit.   One second later, on 19-January-2038 at 3:14:08 AM GMT, disaster strikes.   When a signed integer reaches its maximum value and then gets incremented, it wraps around to its lowest possible negative value. This means a 32-bit signed integer, such as a time_t, set to its maximum value of 2 147 483 647 and then incremented b

So, if all goes normally, 19-January-2038 will suddenly become 13-December-1901 in every time_t across the globe, and every date calculation based on this figure will go haywire. And it gets worse.

             This theory is based on thee fact that most computers
today are 32-bit. But as we are already seeing, computers migrating
towards 64-bit computing. So think of what would be the norm in 2038,
where computers would be 64-bit or higher say 128-bit. Which means
this is not likely to occur even in 2068.

Mr.Ramanraj, can you consider the following suggestion, please?
with your legal background can you get the ilugc registered properly 
in accordance with the provisions of the Indian laws? the facts of the case,
briefly are : a body of persons called ILUGC exists. The first set of signatories
are yet to be evolved to create the existence formally; if created legally then there 
can be freedom without any apprehensions as stated above, supra; a few persons chosen can handle the legal stuff say every quarter/annually, even while all the regular technical work and meets continue.
my suggesstion is that the sooner the better bcos this will invariably come up soon

The move to 64-bit processor will not mitigate the need to make changes in
the date handling functions and at the very least do a full re-compile. A
lot of the date handling functions use OR and AND operations to pack date
values - these will have to be modified.

The problem is that 64-bit processors are normally run in "Compatibility
mode" which essentially means that the processor will treat Integers as
32-bit values rather than the full 64-bit so as not to break applications
which are compiled only with 32-bit support. However, the processor does
support the running of both 64-bit and 32-bit apps at the same time.

This is true for both AMD's and well as Intel's offerings. To understand
this better, please read the documentation for these processors. AMD64 has
two primary modes of operation - the "Long" mode and the "Legacy" mode.
The long mode has two sub-modes - one being the 64-bit mode and the other
being the "Compatibility Mode" which I wrote about.

But yes, the situation is not that dire. A few minor changes in the date
handling code and a full recompile will solve most issues.

Hi,

AFAIK today's 64-bit processors are designed to support both 32-bit &
64-bit apps. This is because, as you might have already know, 32-bit
is dominant & most apps are designed to  run on 32-bit,hence this
32-bit support. But as we see more & more 64-bit entering mainstream
(which includes home users b'cos they have a large user base & hence
their need to support them). So we would be seeing more codes for
64-bit computing. Hence i think the bug is not likely to surface in
the predicted time.

ashwin

if someone registers the name, the ilugc will have to go to court to 
prove that it had the name first. If the name is registered by 
ilugc, the other side would have to go to court. I am of the 
opinion that it is better to register. Incidently, hijacking of 
blug took place not because it was registered, but in spite of the 
fact that it was registered. As long as you have active members and 
the society is registered - no one can hijack it. If there are no 
active members, then it is irrelevant whether it is hijacked or 
not. Just my 2 paise.

ILUGC mailing list, activities, etc. are already part of ae.iitm.ac.in, 
and if "ILUGC" is such a valuable mark - it could probably be registered 
as a trademark, and I have nothing more to say on this.

For general guidance on organising free software user groups elsewhere, 
I'll send a brief note that I wrote sometime back.

Subject: [Ilugc] Free Software User Groups
Message-ID: <439515BA.90808@gmail.com>

Rick Moen  has written  an excellent and  useful user group  HOWTO at:
http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/User-Group-HOWTO.html 
<http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/User-Group-HOWTO.html>

What follows is about how free software user groups could be organised 
locally in Tamil Nadu.  I wrote most of it sometime back, and the only 
thing I could add is, it may be worthwhile to register marks associated 
with the fsug, if that is perceived as important for the sake of 
identity.  Though "Linux" is a generic word, I would suggest organisers 
to choose a name that is more general like "fsug" as part of the name so 
that the scope is as wide as possible to include discussions about 
Linux, GNU, FreeBSD or the others.

There is a proposal to allow Limited Liability Partnerships in India, 
that could function like companies under the ROC, and this may suit some 
but they would have to wait for the law to crystallise. For now:

Typically, we may classify FSUGs into three categories.

#1: FSUG's Structured within an Institution

Many colleges already have an internet presence, and it is very easy
to run web servers, mailing list servers, ftp, wiki, cvs etc with
minimal effort. Free Software tools like the GNU Mailman, Apache Web
Server, Wikimedia, CVS etc could be installed to set up the bare needs
for setting up a FSUG.  It needs only one Admin and a few volunteers
to keep things going.

ILUGC and many of the FSUGs operating from colleges at present follow
this style, and it is the least cumbersome and most beneficial general
purpose model, that works well from within an institutional framework.
 PostgreSQL, NetBSD and others originated from such an environment.

#2: Informal FSUGs maintained by small groups of individuals, ngo's
and other orgs:

The vast majority of FSUGs have virtual existence, using mailing list
facilities offered by Yahoo, Google, Savannah, SourceForge etc.  It
costs nothing to create a FSUG from these sites, and these FSUGs play
a major role in spreading the use of Free Software in pockets where
there no other help is conceivable.  If you are the lone GNU/Linux
user in your locality, you may think of starting a FSUG for your
locality :)

#3:  FSUGs Registered as a Society/Co-operative Society/Non-profit 
Company/Trust

Legal formalities are the hall-mark of these entities, making it
suitable for only dedicated Free Software enthusiasts who will be
required to interact with statutory authorities to maintain and run
the organisation and may also need to take assistance from
professionals like auditors, lawyers and other experts.

Groups interested in building specialised computer programs,
supercomputers, community kiosks, community wiki, specialised fs
distributions or doing other tasks that involve some investment, would
need to orgranise a framework that can service the ends.

It is very difficult to generalise, but the simplest way to legally
organise a FSUG is to register it as a Society, under the Tamil Nadu
Societies Registration Act, 1975.

A very brief introduction to how Societies are created, maintained and
dissolved:

Any society which has for its object the promotion of education,
literature, science, religion, charity, social reform, art, crafts,
cottage industries, athletics, sports (including indoor games),
recreation, public health, social service, cultural activities, the
diffusion of useful knowledge or such other useful objects within the
State Legislative domain *may* be registered under the Tamil Nadu
Societies Registration Act.

Societies with not less than 20 members or whose annual gross income
or expenditure is not less than Rs.10,000/- need to be compulsorily
registered. For the purpose of registration, the society would need to
file its memorandum specifying the name of the society, the objects of
the society, the names, addresses and occupations of the members of
the committee; and the byelaws of the society.  Every registered
Society shall keep a Registered Office, keep a board (also in Tamil :)
outside its RO, maintain a register containing the names, addresses
and occupation of its members (that is open to inspection during
business hours), have a committee of not less than three members to
manage its affairs whose  term is not to be more than three years and
are appointed at a meeting by a resolution of a majority of members,
keep books of accounts audited by an auditor, file prescribed forms
before the Registrar.  Under bye-laws, members may be required to pay
subscriptions.

Atleast one AGM shall be conducted every year after notice to members,
and minutes shall be maintained and filed.

The society may sue and be sued, members guilty of arrears or
embezzelment may be  dealt with as strangers.

Two or more societies may be amalgamated or a society may divide into
two or more with approval of Registrar.

A Society may be wound up, but after satisfaction of all debts and
liabilities, the remainder shall *not* be paid to members of the
society, but shall be given to some other registered society having
the same or similar objects (that can be determined by a special
resolution of the society itself).

FSUGs organised as Registered Societies in India:

2) Linux-Delhi.org says that they are in the process of getting
registered as a Society.  Check out their societification page at
http://www.cyberindian.com/india/index.php?action=jump&jumpto=2225 
<http://www.cyberindian.com/india/index.php?action=jump&jumpto=2225>

NASSCOM  (National Association of Software and Service Companies
www.nasscom.org <http://www.nasscom.org> ) is organised as a Society but 
it is yet to become
seriously involved with the free software movement.  When Free
Software becomes more widely recognised and appreciated, NASSCOM would
necessarily get transformed and may become a nodal point for Free
Software User Groups.

Non-profit Companies and Co-operative societies are even more formal,
and discussing them would make this post much more longer ;)  Free
Software Foundation of India ( www.gnu.org.in <http://www.gnu.org.in> ) 
is registered as a
non-profit company under the Companies Act, with office at Trivandrum.

In Tamil Nadu, the co-operative movement has been successful, and it
may be worth trying out this model, say to build supercomputers or  to
subsidise computer based goodies.  One of the largest organisations
has an annual turnover of more than Rs. 80 Crores.  If any group is
seriously interested in dedicating themselves in this line, it could
benefit the masses in very tangible ways.

Unlike the above not-for-profit entities, if groups are looking for
ways of earning private profit from Free Software, they would organise
themselves as consultants, service providers, run proprietary
concerns, form partnerships, pvt/public limited companies,  and other
types of associations with clear objectives to earn profit.
Generally, providing custom services are the main business of
for-profit organisations, but they invariably extend support to
not-for-profit organisations through donations and offer other kinds

Looks like forming a society will entail more administrative work than
actually discussing open source issues - sucking out the fun in the
process. Soon politicking will also set in. And am sure there will be
bribes to be paid to the clerks, registrars etc. So my vote is to let
things be and hope no one will do the unthinkable. After all who gains
what by hijacking chennailug!!

Message-ID: <20051206085448.77794.qmail@web31004.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

Today I had installed FC4 on Intel D915GVGL
Motherboard with Segate SATA 80GB HDD.

It hangs with Kernel Panic error as follows.

RAMDISK: Could'nt found any ramdisk at 0
VFS: cannot open root

After this the system hangs.

I restarted the system, at boot prompt I mistyped
"linux askmethod" (I use to install via nfs) as "linyx
askmethod". It show error as "Could not find Kernal
Image: linyx".

Again at boot prompt i typed correctly as "linux
askmethod".

The installation goes well without any error and the
system boot/works without error.

Agin i boot the system with FC4 1 CD. I just Press
ENTER or type the correct command it stops with KERNEL
PANIC Error.

if i type anything wrong at first and again type
correct command at boot prompt my installation goes
well.

What could be the reason for this?.

Thanks

Rgds.
Babu. J

You seem to be under the impression that moving from 32-bit integer
type to 64-bit integer type will delay this problem only up to 2068 -
not true. Just by using a 64-bit type for integers, you delay this
problem for a whopping 292 million years.

Actually, this bug is already manifesting itself.

Here in the UK, mortgages (similar to our housing loans) are taken for
periods like 30-35 years. Look at what happens when I try to see when
my mortgage expires:

[root@avalanche root]# date -d '32 years'
Sun Dec  6 09:57:25 GMT 2037
[root@avalanche root]# date -d '33 years'

Message-ID: <439561C9.7030802@gmx.net>

Hello All,

          In the lines of PDX.rb, Seattle.rb and other Ruby Brigades 
(you can call them ruby user groups) I'm proud to announce the Chennai 
Ruby Brigade, in short called Chennai.rb (.rb is also the extension of a 
Ruby file).

          What do we intend to do? Simple. Learn & enjoy Ruby. Currently 
I'm thinking of a monthly meet up where in we can exchange ideas, cool 
ruby snippets, break our heads on continuations and drool at the latest 
Rails feature. Yes, I'm introduced to Ruby through Rails, and it sure is 
a framework worthy of the language.

          We will discuss the idiosyncrasies of _why's writing style (if 
you're a Ruby fan, you should know who 'Why The Lucky Stiff' is), try to 
answer the weekly Ruby Quiz and start zany/silly projects like Sudoku 
solvers. I promise, we will try to be very elitist, and only the coolest 
and the best talks will be allowed. That is, you give a talk at 
Chennai.rb, you better be prepared. Excited? Here's where you subscribe:

http://groups.google.com/group/chennairb

         As an introductory session, I'm thinking of a one-hour talk 
named "Welcome to Rubyland" on Saturday, the 17th of December (I'm no 
Ruby guru, so if somebody has lots of Ruby experience, they're most 
welcome to give the talk). But remember, prepare, prepare, prepare! We 
all have very little time to blow, so let's make it worth the trouble. 
We will try not to conflict with the ILUGC/GLV meeting timings.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
First ever Chennai.rb meet up:

Date: 17th December, 2005                                         
Venue: Ma Foi Academy
Time:   Exactly at 4pm IST (No, the time is *not* stretchable)

(Having our meets on 1st/3rd/5th Saturdays means we can have the 
excellent F&H coffee - but no snacks though, unless some noble corporate 
soul sponsors it)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome All! Let's have further discussions on the chennai.rb list! All 
the luggers who couldn't be bothered about Ruby, sorry for the noise. 
After all, it's an open source language ;-)

You can keep track of our progress here:

Vamsee.

An RFC on the same

Hi,

   I am tring to build Linux from scratch using
Debian. So I started it, but I am struck at the very
step. I need the kernel image 2.6.8 for this where I
am having Kernel 2.4 in my Debain system. What I have
done is I installed Kernel 2.6.8 using apt-get install
kernel-image-2.6.8 and then reboot. when I tried to
start the system using Kernel 2.6.8 I am facing an
error like:

Cannot open /dev/console: file not found 

I tried with apt-get upgrade <kernel-image> also Still
same error.

Can anyone tell me how to upgrade the Debian Kernel
from 2.4 to 2.6.8

Are you trying to migrate from woody -> sarge ? Or, wish to upgrade
just your kernel 2.4 -> 2.8 ? If you meant case (1), i recommend you
to configure /etc/apt/source.list and run 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'.
If you meant case (2), confirm 2.6.8 is installed by checking
/lib/modules/. If boot loader resides in the same dir, it would have
got updated automatically. If not, you must edit your boot loader conf
file accordingly and re-install your boot loader.

My mistake. Read that as 292 billion years (2^63 seconds/31 million
seconds/year).

To put that number is perspective, all current estimates of the age of
the universe puts it at between 10-15 billion years
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Universe).

Your question is processor and kernel dependant. 

Check under arch/<architecture>/kernel/ in the kernel
sources.

On the other hand, do we have TV guide listing the details of indian

Yes. They need to know about free/open source software
and the philosophy behind free software.

Lot of companies use proprietary $oftware crap on the

Any campaign involves resources of people, time and money that are 
limited, and organising them efficiently is the only way to achieve 
productivity.  Most legal devices are designed to enable people in 
society to plan their goals orderly, transparently and peacefully.  In 
well run organisations, the admin, though always around and working, 
would probably never be seen or visible (like the kernel).  In badly run 
ones, the admin would be in the center stage and no work would get done 
without glitches.  The balanced approach to organisation in development 
is elaborately narrated by Frederick P. Brooks in "The Mythical 
Man-Month" drawing from his experience as project manager for IBM 
System/360. Lack of access to computers (minimal to supersize) is a 
matter of concern from the times of Charles Babbage to this day.  If 
everything else has failed, in spite of the problems involved, formal 
organisation could help groups to service their wants - particularly if 
higher level orgs do not give priority to needs.

"TwinCLinG" used for long by ilug-hyd could be seen as "hijacked" by the 
gang at http://www.twincling.org/ or as "sharing" and "contribution" by 
ilug-hyd.  Time will tell if such gangs survive or perish ;)

The software itself is free and there is no point in "branding" 
activities.  In fact, the "brand building strategies" do  more harm than 
good as they tend to spoil portability.  The distro naming mania could 
end if people called the distros they use by the name of installer they 
use: yast, synaptic, apt etc.

Thanks for pointing that: societification|formalistion would also help

Hi

   I want to know whether creating a base system using
Debian system and Fedora system is same or any thing
varies. 
  
   Actually I want to create a Linux Distribution CD
for which I started working out from Linux from
Scratch (LFS) and create a base system. Due to kernel
requirement of 2.6 for Debian I am tring it on Fedora
Core 3. Can I continue this way or not?

Any Ideas??????

I agree with Ramanraj. His analysis is good. The more dominated, a system or
network, the less preferred it would be.

So the best is to allow people to administer themselves, with the exception
of making personal attacks/totally offtopic marketing, etc.

It should be a true initiative of members, by members, for members.

Registering as a society, if a formality for a bank account, needs just 7
persons and a name, with a President, Secretary, Treasurer and bye-laws and
activities list.

It is preferable to have joint cheque signing powers with any 2 office
bearers. It is prefereable to put in the site all transactions, for
transparency and accountability.

Which is basically a collection of packages. What is
important is only the versions of the individual
packages.

Debian and Fedora are GNU/Linux distributions. A
distro has a package management system and package
installer. 

You may or may not have a package
manager/package-installer in a base system (example,
embedded systems).

You just need to run mke2fs -j /dev/whatever on your windows partition.

Why do you want to extract it? Just install it as
root:

rpm -ivh <filename>.rpm

No, I couldn't able to extract the Kernel*.delta.rpm. It is giving

I have internal pinnacle TV tuner card and I use xawtv it works
like a charm, try using it. A module called scantv comes along with
it for channel scan.

Subject: [GKD] Microsoft Donations: Roses with Thorns?
To: gkd@milhouse.edc.org

Dear GKD Members,

I am writing from Oaxaca, Mexico where I am visiting communities in the
highlands. They have been beneficiaries of a very cool project financed in
part by the Gates foundation to install a wireless connection and a set of
computers for the schools. We are working on a network in the Latin America
region for communities for which we use by preference
FireFox as our browser. We suggested they try this browser as Explorer was
causing problems, and discovered to our surprise that the Gates foundation
"gift" comes with tags.

The computer network does not allow any of the users of the donated
computers to install any software not owned by Microsoft, even any open
source software. The network within which the computers reside will not
allow any individual computers to download software to install, ostensibly
to prevent viruses and incompatible software from jeopardizing the Microsoft
system.

These are computers installed for educational purposes in a number of
telecenters in the public libraries in Mexico for all the young students
preparing for a global world. These computers are therefore their only
affordable access to the Internet and to learning about computers and
programs. A significant number of them will leave this town to work at least
part of their life elsewhere in Mexico or in the U.S. Their work and career
opportunities will depend upon their skills and preparedness.

I am reminded of my youth, working in the vicinity of USAID programs which
only purchased American-made cars shipped to remote corners of Asia for
irrigation projects, etc., because the tied money only allowed US bids.
(Ever try to blow up a pneumatic truck tire with a bicycle pump in a small
town in Asia? )

Is this standard Gates foundation policies?????? Is this type of tag
allowed??

Interested to hear from those of you who are more knowledgeable on this
point.

Some links in main page deleted by me now. We need to check up other
pages also.

Can we build a notification mechanism in wiki to send mail to
list/group of ids, which sends diff of each change. This helps

1.Keeping the list aware of which page changed and thus making people
to visit the page.

2.Keep an eye on the changes and remove unwanted materials
immediately.

	OS.
Message-ID: <e0900f3e0512082030i3aebe382s83aa09bc87c3bb11@mail.gmail.com>

My box is an intel 845 chipset - P4 processor one.
I previously had XP and FC4. Yesterday, i installed sarge, and the grub
installed by sarge doesn't boot my FC4. The menu.lst file of my sarge
contains the following to boot fedora:

title           Fedora Core release 4 (Stentz) (on /dev/hda7)
root            (hd0,6)
kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.11-1.1369_FC4 root=/dev/hda7
savedefault
boot

It gets hung after issuing verbose outputs on SELINUX initialization.

I then tried to change the kernel parameter from  /boot/vmlinuz-
2.6.11-1.1369_FC4 root=/dev/hda7 to  /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.11-1.1369_FC4 ro
root=/dev/hda7 rhgb quiet

Then it hanged at the Uncompressing linux *****..... step itself.

Please help me get my FC4 to normal

I think you were using GRUB installed from Fedora Core before installing
the sarge. So you should have your original menu.lst in the /boot/grub
of FC4 partition. The FC4 entries in this file can be compared with the
current menu.lst to find the odd thing out.

Wiki is a  cool thing. If you  can setup the wiki to  only allow edits
from registered users, nothing like a wiki.

Why do you want to re-install GNU/Linux again? This is
not winblow$.

You only need to re-install grub onto the MBR. Google
for HOWTOs.

no u dont have to reinstall. if u have the ubuntu live cd.. (or any
other live cd for that matter) put in and boot from it. Then open
terminal and change to root user. now run the command
'grub-install /dev/hda' or replace the device name with your boot
drive (/boot) name. and restart :-)

go to http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/<your-page-name>. if the page
already exists it will show up. otherwise it will tell u that there is
no text in that page. then you can edit it clicking on the edit button
on the top :-)

P.S Please log in before you create the page. It helps for better accounting

edit any page and add the word MyViews to it. Save. MyViews will

Hello Deepak,

This is the solution.

boot: linux rescue

... and press Enter. The installer will ask you a few questions like the 
language you would like to use, the type of keyboard etc. Then, if you have 
linux previously installed on your machine, the installer will automatically 
detect it and mount it in the /mnt/sysimage directory. Once the linux 
partition is mounted, you are dropped into the command shell prompt. The 
next step is to make your newly mounted directory the root (or parent) 
directory. This you do by running the chroot command as follows:

# chroot /mnt/sysimage
# _

Now you are in the shell with respect to the parent directory which is the 
linux partition on your harddisk.

>From here, the steps needed depends on which bootloader you are using. You 
have to have a fair idea what is the device node of your harddisk partition 
housing your MBR. In most cases, it is /dev/hda if you have an IDE harddisk. 
But if you have a SCSI harddisk, it will be /dev/sda.

Restoring GRUB
Execute the following command :

# grub-install /dev/hda

... to install GRUB boot loader on to your MBR. And then type exit to reboot 
the machine. Now your GRUB boot loader is fixed.

###NOTE### : Works with Fedora core.. Should work with any other distro 
also!!!

Regards,
Aanjhan

just set your /etc/apt/sources.list file to include the sarge/etch
repositories and do a `apt-get dist-upgrade' (or alternatively, press
`u' in aptitude)

if u are doing a major update, it is suggested that you install
apt-listchanges before proceeding, this way you will get to know about
any changes that necessitate any manual changes.

regarding changing from 2.4 to 2.6, u just need to install the latest
kernel-image-2.6* package (for sarge) or linux-image-2.6* package (for
etch or later). make sure you recompile any local modules
(module-assistant takes care of module src packages installed using
debian, during the linux-image package installation)

hth :)

it moves on...

I'ld recomment `mkfs -t ext3 /dev/whatever`.

grub-install shouldn't be required. Infact even if you use lilo, you will
not have to reinstall lilo on the MBR, since the partition table is intact.
mkfs changes only the partition's contents.
if you make changes to the partition table, then  you must rerun lilo.
unless you move grub's  files to a different partition, (or make changes
to the partition containing it,) I think you will not have to re-run
grub-install.

Hi,
  I have a doubt.  Just like redirecting  the standard   output in a terminal to the null output by piping the output to  /dev/null, how do i redirect a X application's display to a null output?
  To be more clear, I have an application that loads on boot up(say GAIM,  i have it in rc.local). The gaim displays a window as soon as it loads.  I dont want the X window to be seen,(I need it to be redirected to a  null output). Now how do I do this?

Yes. apt-get install linux-image-2.6.12-(686, smp etc.). 2.6.12 has
support for 915 sound as well as graphics. You don't need to recompile
the kernel, but you do need to boot nto the new kernel.

I would like to know will there be any special parameters (boot
parameters) to pass while installing debian sarge 3.1r0 in this server
hardware. Is there any specific debian distribution optimized for this
class of servers. If anyone have experience instaling debian sarge in
BL30P please share it here :) Thanks in advance.

Greetings!

I am looking to buy a USB-to-RS232 (DB-9 female)
cable. I found Wiretek (around Rs.400/-) and D-link
(around Rs.700/-) at Ritchie street. Do these have
Linux driver support?

I would like to know if anyone of you are using any of
these cables with GNU/Linux? Or do you recommend any
others that are available at Ritchie street.

I have basic CONFIG_USB_SERIAL support built-in the
kernel.

Thanks,

SK

The redirection is for standard streams. I don't think X is a stream!
Well, correct me if not. Do you want to start "gaim" minimized?

I don't know if its available in Ritchie street, but I am successfully using a
prolific usb to rs232 (male) converter in linux. Another, belkin converter
also works just fine but I had some hardware problems unrelated to linux.

I use a Prolific PL2303 converter and am pretty happy with it.

http://www.prolific.com.tw/eng/Products.asp?ID=59

Look into Documentation/usb/usb-serial.txt to see the models
supported. I didn't find the ones you mention listed there - the only
other vendor I recognise is Belkin. :)

i doubt they packed HD Audio with the repo binaries. But hey if u
compile your own kernel you get a p4 optimised kernel compared to i686

does this differ from

mke2fs -j


what i thought was that mkfs is a frontend to mkfs.ext3 which i
thought works in much the same way as mke2fs..

Thankx. I use mythtv. It works fine, except the autoscan doesn't
detect the channels & frequencies. Could you please get me the list of

Yes, its different.

-j is for enabling journaling option in the
filesystem, useful for better recovery.

It does have intel HD audio driver compiled. And, as you say, it is
always better to compile your own kernel, so that you can keep what
you want and get rid of all unnecessary drivers. But the OP wanted to
avoid that...

true - but sudhanthiramana, to me anyway, sounds more like 
'independent' than 'freedom' (i am no tamil pundit) viduthalai?

To avoid the confusion, I feel, we can use the English word "Freedom".
Nowadays, Tamil people are more comfortable with Tanglish.

Hi Abishek,
Thanks for the reply.It'l be nice if if i can start "gaim" minimized..tell me how..
But it doesnt end with it. certain display windows cant be reduced or minimized.
Like the ones when u open acroread, open office or lime wire. I actually want to prevent these windows from being displayed.
Basically the user should not see what X window applications are loaded during startup (except from the system tray). Of course he can find it from rc.local!!

Huh???

More precisely:

       -j     Create the filesystem with an ext3 journal.

which is exactly what mkfs -t ext3 would do. That is, ext3 = ext3. So
can you please explain how the two commands differ?

Functionality wise they are the same. But, mkfs is a
wrap-around to other mkfs(.) calls. See the BUGS
section in man mkfs for its limitations. 

Its better to use tune2fs to convert ext2 to ext3
filesystems.

There is more to it. mkfs.ext3 and mke2fs are exactly the same program
- check their inode numbers and MD5 sums. I agree that mkfs -t foo
just calls mkfs.foo, but apart from the extra fork/exec overhead, I
cannot see any reason to recommend one over the other.

> Its better to use tune2fs to convert ext2 to ext3 filesystems.

That's for converting. For a fresh partition (which is what this
thread is all about), the way to go is mke2fs -j and equivalent, mkfs
-t ext3 (which are identical, no reason to recommend one over the
other).

Hi All,
There have been some discussions about this in tamil mailings lists and also
if remember correct in tamillinux mailing list also.

Right now many of the tamil authors are using the following terms:
Opensource -> Thira moolam ,
Opensource software -> Thira moola menporul

For Free software a good translation was given by one Dr.Irama.ki (
http://valavu.blogspot.com/ )
Free ==> pari  (means given free out of love without any strings attached to
it, read it similar to "parinthu koduthal" )
Free Software => Pari Niral or Pari Menporul

Also Dr.Irama.ki suggested "Thira Ootru" for Open Source  instead of Thira
Moolam
meaning Opensource software => Thira vootru menporul

Its upto us to adopt which ever is good :)

Regards,
Mugunth

Message-ID: <20051212092644.50684.qmail@web54504.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi
 
In my system I proceeded to install ubuntu 5.10 in a 10gb FAT32 partition which is empty (no data).The installer proceeded upto Parition disk stage. 
I Choose Manually edit partition table option. 
The next screen showed the existing 
IDE1 Master (hda)- 40 gb ............
It did not list the already existing
 
 C:    NTFS(10),
 D:    FAT(10)
 E:    FAT(10), 
        ext3(MDK) and swap(10)
partitions. I was a little scared. So I stopped proceeding furhter and rebooted.
 
I did expect that will list all the existing partitions in the hdd So that I can choose the empty fat partition and create ext3 file system with / mount point to proceed the installation. 
Will it list the partitions if I select the HDD listed and enter once again? Should I delete FAT32 partition first before creating ext3? 
 
Please clarify.
 
R.Dhanagopal

Strange! Confirm you dont have 2 hard disks connected to the system!
Can you get us the *actual* details you see in this screen ?

> Will it list the partitions if I select the HDD listed and enter once again? Should I delete FAT32 partition first before creating ext3?

It must list all partitions as it is. In this screen, you must be able
to re-partition FAT32 as EXT3.

hi all,

do anybody know how to detect if Windows is installed in a system by reading

any idea how to do it?

the only idea what i got is to mount fat32 or ntfs filesystems and search

Hi,

I want a perl programmer with good system knowledge for a very short
assignment. Basically it is for installing a perl app on a solaris
box. It is throwing a lot of dependency errors. In my assessment the
job wont take more than a couple of hours. Part-time/after-office hrs
will also be considered.

If interested pls reply to this mail with your contact number and I

You can use X Virtual frame buffer to redirect the GUI.

For example I some time run realplayer at command mode as follows

XVFB='Xvfb :2 -ac
export DISPLAY=:2
$XVFB 1>/dev/null 2>&1
realplay file.rm

The command Xvfb starts virtual frame buffer.

that's the job of the window manager (though many apps provide an
option to do such "window manager"ly activities). enlightenment (which
I use) and many others provide this as an option on a window-by-window
basis...

> But it doesnt end with it. certain display windows cant be reduced or minimized.

what do u mean by they can't be minimized? could u please elucidate.
and if they "can't" be minimized, they can't be hidden as well...
because "minimized" is just hiding the window with a hint to the
window manager, so that it can put up some ui or icon in an iconbar or
something like that...

> Basically the user should not see what X window applications are loaded during startup (except from the system tray). Of course he can find it from rc.local!!

are you sure you want to load apps in rc.local? afaik, ~/.xsession is
a better place. rc.local starts the app as root and is meant for
services/commands which need to execute at startup and do not have a
dedicated file in /etc/init.d

it moves on...

Hello,

via a web-page user interface and the default ip is 192.168.100.1 at the eth
end . so ppl can connect to their modem via a browser with
http://192.168.100.1.  The ip of  the modem in the other  end (HfC end)  is
10.101.12.222.   Is there a way for me to connect to the modem using
10.101.12.222 ip address though i am in the opposite end.

See if this helps. MBR has info about four partitions
with one being set as bootable (bootable flag in
partition table). Check if this is set if it is set
then add a entry in boot loader. This is what bios
does to boot the system (loads the boot record from a
partition which is set as bootable if MBR has no
executable code).

It seems to be diskdrake's (Mandrake's disk partitioning tool) hand work
:-)  Diskdrake is so clever to manage any kind of partition. But the
worst part is, once diskdrake alter the partition table, many other
distro's or windows can't recognize the partition table properly
(atleast in my case - consistently). But existing partition will be
working properly. Other OS disk tools will show partition table as big
junk. e.g: Disk Manager of Windows shows that my HDD drive is of
capacity 40 GB (Yes,  perfect!), but the total size of all partition
comes 120GB (How can it be?). This is not the issue with Windows. Redhat
8.0 also did not recognize the partition table in this case. Debian too.

My suggestion is to check the partition table from Windows (if u want to
retain windows). Delete the MDK (after backup if any) partitions and
ensure that windows shows proper valid partition table. Then you install
Ubuntu. Finally you consider MDK if you want.

Thanks for the offer Binand. Am afraid the the errors thrown are too
many to list here. Trying to solve one dependency throws other
dependency errors. To compound the problem, we do not have direct
access to the solaris box and we have to direct our clients admin
through emails (we hope to get access to the clients solaris box this
week though).

Moreover, am not sure our client would be too happy about discussing
this in a public forum.

Again, thanks for the offer and if I dont get anybody I might have to
spill my woes here after all :-)

If you meant dependency errors during perl module installation, you
must use cpan shell. IMO, it's too smart to handle all dependency
issues.

Hi
 

Regarding Ubutu installation, I am having only one 40 gb hdd and the fstab entry is given below. My idea is to isntall Ubuntu 5.10 /dev/hda6 and to multiboot winxp, mandriva and ubuntu using grub. I am unable to proceed the ubutu installation since the intaller fails to display the existing partition in my hdd evenafter selecting the - manually edit partition table - option.  

 

it displays only the following line.

 

IDE1 master (hda) - 40 GB ST340823A

 

If I select this it displays the following message.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You have selected an entire device to partition. If you proceed creating a new partition table on the device, then all current partition will be removed.

 

Note that you will be able to undo this operation later if you wish.

 

Creat a new empty partition table on this disk.

If the client is happy about using opensource software like Perl and
BSD then why should he/she be unhappy about getting "Opensource help"
?

Is the perl module/package in question not FOSS and is it owned by the client ?
If that's the case then what you say is right.

Hi again, 

At the moment I am just looking for some softphone applications that can
use alsa stack that linux kernel supoorts and can run on command line
prompt. 

I don't want X windows support at this moment. 

I am not able to get any good reference to start.

Let me know!

Raja

Subject: [Ilugc] Query  : pseudo net device  Tx path
Message-ID: <20051213102422.11596.qmail@webmail67.rediffmail.com>

Hi Friends,

   I have created pseudo net device for vlan application. This interface is visible for all linux application. When any linux application sends a packet over this pseudo device, the packet has to be transmitted over the real physical interface (which will be identified from the pseudo device).

The linux application uses "dev_queue_xmit" function to tx the pkt, which in turn invokes "dev->hard_start_xmit" which is the registered
function for the pseudo device.

The Function is called in SOFT_IRQ_CONTEXT,

My query is : 
1) Convertion of the psuedo to physical interface requires a huge 
database access. whether this can be done in this context?

2) I tried splitting the functionality into two by putting a seperate task,  proccessing that task in tq_immediate list (BH processing).

  Sometimes the task is not getting scheduled. I dont know the reason ...

3) So I used tasklet for this function and scheduled it using "high"
priority. It seems to be working fine. But my concern is whether  any kernel thread will get stalled because of this?

If the above solution are not correct. Please let me know the correct way of programming this.

Thanks for spending your time.

Thanks and Regards,
SenthilKG.

Just to narrow down the problem, you try to install any other
gnu/linux distribution. It is to identify whether the problem is with
ubuntu linux installation or your hard disk partition. If the problem
exists, i recommend you to follow T.KaruppuSwamy's suggestion.

It seems to be diskdrake's (Mandrake's disk partitioning tool) hand 
work
:-)  Diskdrake is so clever to manage any kind of partition. But the
worst part is, once diskdrake alter the partition table, many other
distro's or windows can't recognize the partition table properly
(atleast in my case - consistently). But existing partition will be
working properly. Other OS disk tools will show partition table as big
junk. e.g: Disk Manager of Windows shows that my HDD drive is of
capacity 40 GB (Yes,  perfect!), but the total size of all partition
comes 120GB (How can it be?). This is not the issue with Windows. 
Redhat
 
Mr.Karuppu Swamy
 
You are 100% correct. My Windows disk manager lists mandriva and swap partitions twice.
And one set of swap and Linux partition is shown as unallocated and empty. 
(Total listed parition size is more than 40 gb, which can not be). 
 
What will happen if I delete the pseudo? paritions which are lised as unallocated and empty by window disk manger
from windows? Will it corrupt the FAT and make system unbootable?
 
It took lot of efforts to fine tune my Mandirva LE 2005 (modem setup and Openoffice 2.0 installation etc).
So I hesitate to remove the Mandriva to install ubuntu before exploring other alternatives?
 
Thanks a lot for your suggestion.

Hi,

Iam not familiar with the bootloader of windows. you
may check whether any unique signature is found on the
windows bootloader.

What I wanted to express was immaterial of any OS
being installed the user expects your bootloader to
have a entry. You can blindly assume that FAT32/NTFS
contains Windows if its bootable flag is set

Check this output of "fdisk -l"

Disk /dev/hda: 40.0 GB, 40060403712 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 4870 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id
 System
/dev/hda1   *           1          13      104391   83
 Linux
/dev/hda2              14          78      522112+  82
 Linux swap
/dev/hda3              79        4870    38491740   83
 Linux

here /dev/hda1 is bootable and filesystem is some
linux filesystem because the Id is 83 and hence you
can add an entry in bootloader for this partitiion.

Here is a little proglet I had posted a long time ago on
linux-india-programmers. Adapting it to detect Windows left as an
exercise to the reader :)

Usage:

1. Save the code into bootloader.c
2. Compile it - make bootloader
3. Run it - ./bootloader /dev/hda (use your disk here)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        char *dev = argv[1];
        char buf[4];
        int fd;
        fd = open (dev, O_RDONLY);
        if (fd < 0) {
                perror ("open");
                exit (1);
        }

ko!

People are different.  I feel both Gnome and Kde need to learn something
from the other.  Continous improvement is always there. There is not yet a
Buddha programmer. :p

Or what about comparing with OSX?

If you want to know more about partition table then
check this link 

http://www.ata-atapi.com/hiwtab.htm
http://www.ata-atapi.com/hiwmbr.htm

and also for code snippet check this link

http://www.geocities.com/prem_sah1/

this "C" code contains parsing of partition table,
ext2fs etc. It was written long ago for windows.

hi,

thanks for the links....am coding in Python and i already have code to read
raw physical devices,its just few lines in python :-),
anyway for this "boot" thing,i run "fdisk -l" from python,capture the result
in the array.So i get each output (i.e),device,boot,file-system everything
held in arrays.I had done this way for displaying the partitions and somehow
i forgot that i do have a boot flag there.....but then when i explored my
code, i found that, and within minutes i had the "boot" thing done :D

i was rotfl'ing thinking of what would have been the response had
someone else posted that... it was troll! wouldn't have been surprised
if the response was something like "**** ***" (use ur imagination!)...
but here we are, with the lead developers of gnome going on a
defensive and patiently explaining their stand, all because of the
stature of the person who wrote it!

well... i believe that "making it easy for beginners" should encourage
ui designers to come with something which caters to both the geeks and
the beginners. a good example is the use of "more advanced options",
or even having a scriptable configuration system (gnome already has
gconf, dcop i feel is better) which the power hungry can anyway use to
achieve better control. after all, this category of users is more at
home with scripts and the command line than with gui's...i would never
encourage dropping functionality as a solution.

and as regards gnome and kde, torvalds should have known that such
posts and discussions do not lead anywhere...may be it was
frustration...

it moves on...

I dont get it. wats up with Linus..He seems to be mad at the Gnome 
guys...lol..(I use gnome).Personally I dont think GNOME and KDE will 
cater to the same audience in the future and so hopefully there would be 
less flaming. and I think kde is preferred by the beginners to GNOME.

I think Linus is right about this; Gnome has regressed in many ways - some
of the older versions of Gnome were actually easier to use than the new
versions coming out. The file selection dialog is absolutely horrible from
a usability perspective and I find it hard to believe that the Gnome
developers believe that it is actually makes it easier for newbie users.
The KDE file dialog is a whole lot smarter in my humble opinion. Nautilus
is also not really intuitive.

Also regarding Linus voicing his opinion - surely he is entitled to one?
and surely he can voice it in a forum dealing with that exact subject?
Anyone is welcome to disagree with him.

Please note that I am not a KDE fanboy - I use Linux a lot and it powers
most of the computers here at work. I use both Gnome and KDE but I am
increasingly getting frustrated with the UI design appearing in Gnome.
Many of these changes are not intuitive and frankly irritating - take for
instance the "spatial" display used in Nautilus. It is horrible in my
opinion.

Ok, I think I have stirred up enough controversy here. You can start
flaming away challenging me to write a better desktop environment.

Subject: [Ilugc] OpenOffice and Grammar Check
Message-ID: <43A044A3.1080308@gmail.com>

   Hi Friends,
   I am working as a copy editor. Today our entire team doing technical
   documentation was moved to new systems. But my company felt they can use
   free open source software rather than spending thousands of rupees for
   getting licenceed copies for the 150 systems in our new floor. So, they
   installed open office in all the systems. But, almost 99% of my team were
   surprised with this. It was a entirely new one to them. But, thank god i
   was there, that they could manage the day. I almost solved all their
   issues, except two. First, we were using an older version of OpenOffice
   some 1.1.9 or so, that i didn't have word count option. I found out that
   OO2 has that feature and asked my system admins to update all the OOs by
   tomorrow. Second issue was, Grammar check. As we are working as editors,
   we need this tool very much. Even the technical writers need this. But,
   from my browsing, i came to know that this grammat check feature is the
   only one said that is missing in OO for the M$ ofice users. What i want to
   know is that, is there any way to get the stuff for us. Any third party
   plugins like that ?? is there any solution ?? I have got a good name with
   the wok i did with OO today, mainly because of using it in my home ( Linux
   machine ) for the past 1 year. Now, they rely on me to find some solution
   !

   Thanks in advance,

I bought a Bafo Technologies, BF-810 USB to serial
converter at Mercy Electronics, L.B. Road, Chennai for
around Rs.450/-. It uses the PL-2303 driver. I also
bought a serial port DB-9 female to DB-9 female
converter for around Rs.50/-. 

The converter and cable come with a CD which has the
PL-2303 Linux drivers for 2.4 for Redhat 9. But, the
packaging cover only specifies drivers for winblow$.
Huh! The stock kernel sources already have the latest
drivers.

I compiled drivers/usb/serial/usbserial.ko and
drivers/usb/serial/pl2303.ko and loaded them on
2.6.12.3. It was detected fine and /dev/ttyUSB0 was
created!

Thanks to Binand and Vijairaj for their suggestions.

One Day One Command (By Mr Arpit Sud)
======================================

composite -- Composite images together.

Summary:

Composite is used composite/combine/mix images to create new images.
It is a part of the ImageMagick utilities (www.imagemagick.org).

Examples:

$ composite A.jpg B.jpg C.jpg -- Composite A with B and store the 
                                 result in C.

$ composite -compose difference A.png B.png C.png -- Compute the 
              difference between A and B, and store the result in C.

$ composite -geometry +100+150 A.png B.png C.png -- Place A at 
             specified location with B and store the result in C.

$ composite -dissolve 20 A.jpg B.jpg C.jpg -- Dissolve A 20% and mix 
                                   with B, and store the result in C.

$ composite -rotate 40 A.jpg B.png C.gif -- Rotate A 40 Degree and mix 
                                    with B and store the result in C.

Hi All,

I need some help to identify a network monitor to do the following 
task.

Basically I have nearly 50PCs in my network. I want monitor the
network by sniffing the packets and plot the usage graph, at X min
resolution, for each IP address. It is good if the usage splited into
protocols, like HTTP, FTP,...

Already I collected few tool like tcpstat, argus, etc ... But most of
them needs some more work to get this kind of output. So before
starting my work, If you know, any tool, which does this job. Plz
share with me.

Bye :)

 i wish they would also learn basic arithmetic. In css, i have a 
three column layout:
15% 60% 22% - which adds up to 97%. but in ie in 800x600 it adds up 
to more than 100% and the whole display breaks up

Subject: [Ilugc] My first experience with FreeBSD
Message-ID: <43A25EFD.3040908@tandbintl.com>

I have installed FreeBSD 6.0 in my laptop HP nx6120. I have configured
as desktop system during install time. The boot time seems to be quite
fast. Since I have only one CD, the base system has been installed.
packages adding is cool with pkg_add tool. Then I installed afterstep
desktop through ftp, to check the X windows performance. If you have
already worked in linux, FreeBSD is very easy. I thought it was more
server oriented. But it has given me a good knock of proving that
suitable for desktop also. The linux compatibility makes FreeBSD to
utilize the linux based application development. A plenty of application
choice is there to install (as packages and ports). Disk partition tool
highlights slice concept other than partition. The device naming
conventions are slightly different from linux. It follows Debian way of
install (but going back and forth in installation phase is not as
flexible as debian).

Hardware compatibility for my HP nx6120 laptop:
------------------------------------------------------------------
ACPI works just like that without any tweak.
Audio card works without any tweak.
Display works without any tweak.
Network card works without any tweak.
Wireless, Bluetooth and IrDA detected - Not yet tested.

Ah well. Here goes.

What you want to do is called traffic accounting. Typically, the
device on a network that sees ALL traffic is the backbone switching
device - hence traffic accounting is done there. And since more often
than not the backbone device is from Cisco, the technology used is
Cisco Netflow.

On the other hand, if you want to do this only at your border, you can
have a Netflow probe on your border router (the PC :) and a Netflow
collector running on a different box (or even the same one, but
depending on traffic Netflow collection puts quite a high demand on
CPU and storage).

The best-known GPL'ed implementation of a Netflow probe is nProbe from
the guys who wrote ntop.  It is homed at
http://www.ntop.org/nProbe.html. There are several commercial Netflow
analyzers available, google for them - or you could use ntop for a
GPL'ed Netflow collector. Graphing is usually done by RRDTool in
GPL'ed environments.

It is not an easy thing to setup; you need to have exceptional
understanding of TCP/IP and OSI layers (especially layer 2 and layer
3).

Hi,

Try "etherape".

I can assure you it will satisfy you.

Etherape has HTTP,FTP etc protocol.

It is also a X based application.

 What is the Debian way of installing Linux?

   I meant Debian in the following context: The different phases of
   installation process in a menu format. The user can move across the
   process at any instant of installation. It is a flexible way of
   installation. It is not just *next* *next* kind of installation.

One Day One Command (By Mr Arpit Sud)
======================================

identify -- Describe an image.

Summary:

Identify describes the format and characteristics of one or more image
files. It will also report if an image is incomplete or corrupt.  The
information displayed includes the scene number, the file name, the
width and height of the image, whether the image is color mapped or
not, the number of colors in the image, the number of bytes in the
image, the format of the image (JPEG, PNM, etc.), and finally the
number of seconds it took to read and process the image.

It is a part of the ImageMagick utilities (www.imagemagick.org).

Examples:

$ identify img.png -- Show short info about the image.

$ identify a.miff b.png c.jpg d.gif -- Show short info about all 
                                       image files.

$ identify -verbose img.jpg -- Show detailed info about the image.

Read: man identify

 You can use snort, its a web based packet sniffing tool which stores all

Message-ID: <20051217164249.38077.qmail@web51912.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi All,
I am probably raking up the past here. I hope no one
minds.
Abt 2 months ago, I had successfully configured and
connected a
Beetel Modem (GlobeSpan Virata Chipset) supplied by
TouchTel.
I had searched a lot and then came across eciadsl.
I could have saved myself all the trouble if I had
just searched
the ilugc archives. Anyways, it felt satisfying.
Only one curious thing - When I had called and asked
TouchTel techsupport,
the person told me that I *cannot* configure this
modem in linux and that
I have to ask for a router.
Could someone at Chennai(I am not) and still using
TouchTel, call them
up and tell them abt eciadsl? It would save other
users a lot of trouble.
Regards,
Ram

Hm.. why not have it in a central place where it is easier for people to

Greetings!

The photos taken during Vamsee's talk on "Ruby" at Ma
Foi Academy, Chennai on Saturday, December 17, 2005
can be viewed from:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album22

MoM, Saturday, December 17, 2005, 1500 hrs IST
----------------------------------------------

* We started at 1500 hrs IST, and were initially
discussing about restrictions to hostel students at a
university in Chennai. Why computing freedom was not
given to these students, because one/two were
mischievous. Students had got permission to setup a
LAN at their hostel, they paid from their pockets, and
set everything up, only to be forced to dismantle the
setup. Obsolete college admins who don't care for
education or know to use technology. Huh! We had
discussions on possibility of bluetooth LAN or
wireless LANs connection via USB for the students.

* Deepan had some doubts with joomla (formerly,
Mambo), and we walked through the administrator
interface (live!) and had discussions on components,
modules, section, categories in joomla.

* Vamsee began the talk at 1600 hrs IST and
illustrated the coding style and features of Ruby. He
also talked about Ruby on Rails and  showed us good
documentation for learning Ruby.

http://poignantguide.net/ruby/

http://tryruby.hobix.com/

* Vamsee ordered some puffs and coffee/tea and we had
a good munch. He also showed the photos taken at
foss.in and shared his foss.in experience with us. 

* Meanwhile, one Bharanidharan from geminfotech met me
at Ma Foi, and said he was sorry that his folks had
sent spam e-mails to all ilugc members. Hmmmm. He
wanted to know what he could do for ilugc or sponsor
us for any events. Sounded more like commercial to me.
I asked him to attend LUG meetings and first get to
know of our voluntary work for the benefit of society.


* We were then catching up with news in the FLOSS
world. Google recruits came up in our discussion:

http://www.google.co.in/jobs/positions-in.html

* We finished at 1830 hrs IST.

I hope I have covered everything. Please feel free to
add to the above.

Happy Ruby (and duck :) hacking,

Hi Sridhar, Kenneth Gonsalves and others,

Firstly, kudos to Kenneth Gonsalves for taking an
initiative, codecoolies.

> Ooty

Summer 2006?

> Hm.. why not have it in a central place where it is
> easier for people to
> travel to. 

Any suggestions?

> Don't we have more open source developers
> in Bangalore than any
> other city? 

Well. We also have to cater to other cities/remote
places because:

1. There are people in rural areas who cannot afford
to travel to the cities. But, you and me _can_
definitely afford to travel to these places.

2. Having an event in a town/small city gives the
people there an opportunity to market themselves. Some
companies might even want to setup bases in these
places. For example, Honeywell Technologies has an R&D
center in Madurai.  It reduces the pressure on big
cities. Yes, I know about Bangalore traffic.

3. The event bridges the gap between academia and the
industry. Institutes like IIT, in the city, have a
fantastic collaboration with the industry. How many
colleges/institutions in towns/small cities have such
collaboration? Give them an opportunity. The event can
give them contacts for them to establish themselves
well and make a name for themselves.

Having an 2/3-day event in a college is ideal. "Tuxedo
2005" or "Carte Blanche 2005" are good examples. They
were a mixture of contests for students, industry
talks, stalls, fun and frolic!

> I believe the first meet should happen
> in a popular place.

Place doesn't matter. Its the people behind the event
that really matter.

It is that triennial event here - I will get a new business laptop,
and also an option of buying the old one at a much reduced price (this
time the new one is going to be a T42, with fingerprint reader and
whatnot - sweet! :). So I have decided to get back to desktop Linux.
The last time I had one was way back in 2001 - Redhat 7.1, I think.

So I know that a lot of water has flown under the bridge. Kernel is
now at 2.6.x, KDE is 3.5, GCC 3.x, etc. etc. At the moment, I am
considering two options for the distro:

1. OpenSUSE 10 - I have the ISOs downloaded and burnt. I can start
installation today.
2. Fedora Core 5 - wait for it. :)

So I have these questions.

1. I'd want to retain the dual-boot option for the time being. Do I
still have to fiddle around with fips.exe or do modern installers
handle it on their own? The full disk at the moment is on NTFS with
Windows XP SP2 Pro as the OS.
2. Hardware compatibility - Wifi and Infrared, mainly. Wifi it seems
is fully supported, but I haven't seen much discussion about IR.
3. Suspend and hibernate?
4. My camera - Canon IXUS 500.
5. Other assorted USB stuff I have accumulated over time - a Belkin
USB hub, an IBM and a Logitec USB 2-button mouses (mice?) with scroll
wheels, my iPAQ PDA, my Sandisk USB thumb drive etc.
6. My Nokia 6820 mobile phone, via IR (Gnokii?).
7. Does the Thinkpad keyboard work fully? There are several Fn+key
options on the keyboard, plus an extra pair of Forward/Backward keys
on either side of the up-arrow key.

I don't think I'll have a problem with Internet access - my 3Com
ADSL/Wifi router is mostly plug and play with all the providers I have
tried it so far.

The laptop is a Thinkpad T41 with 1GB RAM. I did look at
linux-laptop.net but almost all the reviews there are for Linux-only
boots. I tried a couple of live CDs (Knoppix and Kubuntu), and I am of
the opinion that KDE does look good on this laptop.

You could have partitioned the hard disk on first
power up, when the hard disk was at fat32, the default
factory setting. winblow$ converts the entire
partition to ntfs on first boot. Duh!

> 2. Hardware compatibility - Wifi and Infrared,

Yes. I use ipw2100 on my T41. No monitor mode
operation for this chipset though.

http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net/

Yours could be the ipw2200.

Which model is it? ... (1)

Good in 2.6.x. 

> 4. My camera - Canon IXUS 500.

Supported, both normal mode and PTP mode.

Not sure about mice. I prefer to use the trackpoint on
the T41. 

> my iPAQ PDA, 

Does this help?

http://lwn.net/2001/0607/desktop.php3

> my Sandisk USB thumb drive etc.

Sandisks have good support for GNU/Linux. I use their
256 MB flash drives on Debian 2.6.12.

> 6. My Nokia 6820 mobile phone, via IR (Gnokii?).

See (1) above.

You can always configure the key mappings?

You might also want to post your questions to
linux-thinkpad mailing list:

http://mailman.linux-thinkpad.org/mailman/listinfo/linux-thinkpad

Have fun,

Just in case anyone assumes that Chennai.rb meetings will always have 
snacks, sorry to disappoint you ;-). It was part of our "Rails One Point 
Oh Party" - to celebrate Ruby on Rails hitting 1.0 recently. But I can 
certainly arrange for the coffee/tea for GLV/Chennai.rb/Chennai-py meetings.

Just in case somebody didn't understand that, Shakti was referring to 
Duck Typing in Ruby. I'll also take this opportunity to thank everyone 
who came inspite of the pouring rain. You guys' enthusiasm is really 
encouraging. More good things to come!

Cheers,

I'm sorry, but just that MS adopts an "icon" from a popular open source app,
doesn't meen that they are embracing open source (read: yet not).  The point
I'm trying to make is a LUG should be a LUG. It is *local* Linux users
group. As long as the discussions pertain to locality, solving problems
being faced by users and any general stuff related to Linux and open source,
I feel, that would contribute more towards growth.

I mean, all such philosophy, general discussions can be had on many other
mailing lists like fsf-general, etc ... A LUG should be a LUG. We have
slashdot for what it is mean to be.

If that has concerns on freedom, ilugc-general would suffice. :-)

I accept ILUGC is a local LUG meant for linux discussions, solving
problems providing solutions. But not all local LUGgers are very fond
of reading slashdot, digg, linuxtoday, etc. We need to take global
issues and events to *local* through LUG, IMO.
I'm always against for separate list for OT and general discussions If
you find these are not useful to you you can just ignore this let
other make use of this. (Note: this you is not for Sridhar Ratna)

"Coolie" is an offensive name for unskilled labourers, of Asian origin 
in particular, and it is disgusting to call programmers as "coolies".  
The name and site http://codecoolies.in/ is a poor joke that could only 
hurt people, in the light of the history associated with the word 
"coolie".  If the living conditions of programmers are seriously as bad 
as "coolies", we need to think of ways and means to improve their lot.

this is a matter of opinion - there are a very large number of 
organisations in south india with the word 'coolie' in their names. 
Further we are not calling programmers as coolies. We are 
describing ourselves as coolies - and we have every right to do so. 
I personaly like to think of myself, when programming, as a code 
coolie. Also i personaly dont need to refer to wikipedia to find 
out the connotations of a word that is in everyday use in my 
locality. Here the word just means 'worker'.

   When you press a key, a scan code is read by kernel. In case of special
   keys, you have to map with "setkeycodes" command. To know the
   corresponding key code for your key, refer dmesg after pressing a key.

You can also use "xev" command to get scan codes.

There should be a provision to map it to something useful in Gnome - 
don't know about KDE. I mapped the left one (0x73) to firefox and right 
one (0x74) to thunderbird in my desktop - thankfully, the thinkpad 
doesn't have M$ keys.

Is it working otherwise? If it's a centrino, you need ipw2200 drivers. 
If it's Atheros chipset based, you need Madwifi. If the wireless card is 
not detected & configured automatically by your distro, you need to 
recompile your kernel with the above drivers and muck around with 
wpa_supplicant. Google is your friend. I heard that Ubuntu is a very 
good laptop distro and is good with wireless. I use Debian, so can't say.

Linux on laptop is not yet the joy it is to install on a desktop, so be 
prepared to get your hands dirty. So far, I haven't configured suspend 
to RAM/HDD on my laptop. My experiments with ibm-acpi put the laptop in 
suspend but it won't get back when I open the lid, so I abandoned that 
project for now. The wireless however, works flawlessly.

Hi,

> The Vol Up,Down,Mute buttons to the respective functions

I have a HP/Compaq nx5000, on which I installed Ubuntu Breezy a couple
of weeks back, and surprisingly all these keys were automatically
mapped - the volume up, down and mute that is.

> The M$ Wdws key to some function (is lying waste) --> Any suggestions??

This key usually translates to Super_L or Super_R or something like
that. I use that key to open the "Run" dialog(i.e, Alt+F2 dialog) in
Gnome. It cannot however be used as a modifer key I think(atleast on
gnome).

> And my wireless button to enable wireless in my Laptop

This worked out of the box too! It enables and disables wireless flawlessly.

I havent tried the suspend thing though, so no clue on that one.

I was quite surprised with how well Ubuntu worked actually - was
definitely a joy to install (probably a different kind of joy, from
that described by shakthi! ).

Further, I personally do not feel posting just a URL is good enough if
you want to foster a discussion. Add a few comments of your own, put
in some opinion - then maybe yes. But just the URL ought not be posted
here.

Hi,

Could you post your experinces after installation on thinkpad T41.
B'cos i am also thinnking of switching over to linux on my thinkpad
r40e (ya, older one with lesser features). I already have a desktop
thats linux only. Now i want this thinkpad to dual boot with windows &
linux. I am now sure which distro to use. Already tried a live
CD(ubuntu breezy) with this thinkpad yesterday, works fine, but hangs
a lot when tried to use OO.org. I already have 256MB ram which is more
the recommended value. May be it requires more RAM. I would also like
to know if its possible to repartition the drive, which is fully NTFS
now, without loss of data( i have bbeen using this for quiet a while
now, hence lot have accumulated).

thank you,

with regards,
ashwin

Respected Sir/Madam,

This is to inform you of the availability of the first ever "complete" 
suite of open-source programming languages for Indian vernaculars. It 
includes equivalents of C, C++, lex, yacc, assembly, Java etc. in Hindi, 
Bangla and other vernaculars. Along with this I have also released Hindi 
and Bangla DOS, including BASIC and Logo for vernaculars. The downloads are 
available at http://www.indicybers.com

These projects have won Computer Society of India's Young IT Professional 
Award (Eastern region) 2005 (Winner) and 2004 (Special mention), two years 
in a row. I shall be competing at the 2005 national level now.

Some of the innovations of this project include a system for displaying 
Indic scripts in "true" text-mode. This is done without using any aditional 
hardware. At no point has any graphical (rasterising) method been used for 
this. All the required glyphs have been accomodated in the extended ASCII 
code page, leaving 7-bit ASCII unaltered. This method is applicable to all 
Brahmi derived composite syllabic Indian scripts. Hindi, Bangla, Assamese 
and Gujrati scripts have been implemented. Oriya and Punjabi are under 
development. There are strong suggestions that this may be applicable for 
South Indian scripts as well. This has made it possible to have BIOS/POST 
in Indic. Besides, this system being free, it does not add to the 
procurement cost as compared to commercial products.

Another contribution of this project includes a "case and diacritic 
independent, compiler acceptable" transliteration system. This is 
completely invertible and is applicable to all Indian languages. This has 
direct mapping to the IPA and, hence, may be used to develop programming 
languages in "any" human language. It also has bearings on web technology,  
as it can allow Indic URLs in IPv4 as well. It may be used to encode even 
static web-pages, such that if someone does not have the required fonts 
then one may see the Indic web-page in Roman script transliteration, 
instead of "boxes" (unicode) or garbage (other encodings), from the 
same "static" html.

Finally, the task of Indic programming language design has not been trivial 
either. I have also included support for HP printers. The system uses GCC 
as back-end and is highly portable. There is both ISCII and UNICODE support 
for all languages, including Hindi/Bangla DOS and the IDE. Necessary 
filters have been provided for conversions between ISCII, Romenagri, 
UNICODE, APCISR, HP-PCL etc. The languages have been developed 
synchronically and, hence, there is a certain level of homogenity in 
keyword selection across paradigms. The programs written in Indic 
programming languages are readily converted to their English equivalents 
and hence may be delivered internationally. There is also support for 
translation of variable names and rudimentary literate programming. 
Unreleased languages include Lisp, Prolog, Ada, Pascal, Fortran etc. in 
Inian vernaculars. They shall be released soon, after the initial testing 
and verification of license issues. However the availability of lex and 
yacc makes the issues of targeting specific lanuages quite trivial, and 
these are already available for download along with C, C++, assembly, 
BASIC, logo, and Java in Hindi and Bangla.

Technologically, Hindi/Bangla C/C++/assembly has been used for robotics and 
cluster super-computers. Along with this system, I have also released in 
public domain the design of a natural-interfaced autonomous robot. The 
languages have also been used to successfully implement a Beowulf cluster. 
Effort is now being made towards porting Linux kernel sources to 
Hindi/Bangla C, asm etc. This is aided by the fact that I have also include 
English-programming-language to Hindi/Bangla-programming-language 
translators and vice-versa.

Sir/Madam, I have released all this software as free open source for the 
greater benefit of the vernacular literate population of our country. I do 
not have any financial interests from it. However, I shall appreciate 
support in any form (including coding, awareness, maintainance, and 
financial). I am also looking for a suitable job. My experience includes 
systems programming (compiler design, device drivers, Linux kernel), 
computational linguistics, embedded systems, C/C++/assembly/Java, medical-
informatics, artificial intelligence, and technical writing.

Isn't it called "being selfish"? You want to use LUG
resources for achieving other global objectives?

Ask yourselves what you have done for the FLOSS
community. If you really feel you have accomplished a
lot, contributed enough, had an impact, then you can
think of other global issues.

There is still a lot to be done in terms of promoting
GNU/Linux and FSF, and, you want to use LUG to address
other issues?

... at the expense of?

Again, its just my thoughts.

What I feel would be a better option is to direct users to respective sites
where *they* can get what *they need*. Everyone has his own choice. Instead
if we just focus on LUG related discussions, that would also keep the group
messages relevant so that some users who have subscribed to "digest-mode" or
having hard time reading emails would find it neat! Again, a LUG is a LUG.

I feel a web-based rss reader is more comfortable. Your desktop rss clients
will definitely miss the new posts when you leave your computer switched off
for a week in which case, bloglines servers will save the new posts for you.
- http://www.bloglines.com

Following Sudharshan's suggestion, you will find the following sites useful
(for subscription in bloglines)

1. http://www.slashdot.org (do visit alterslash.org also)
2. http://google.blogspace.com/ - Google related news
3. http://radar.oreilly.com/ - Technology news
4. http://joegrossberg.com/paulgraham.rss - Paul Graham's essays
5. http://www.pythonware.com/daily/ - Daily Python links
6.http://reddit.com/ - Interesting links in the internet today
7. http://gnomedesktop.org/ - GNOME related news (similarly for KDE, ... )
8. http://www.emilychang.com/go/ehub/ - Web2.0 based startups
9. http://www.alistapart.com/ - Web Design
10. http://www.ysearchblog.com/ - Yahoo! search blog
and my whole rss list is available here -

All the above sites provide RSS url. Subscribe to them, if you like in

Kernel Janitors is a project to help a person, who want to be kernel
hackers, get their feet wet, while doing something useful for the
community. URL: http://janitor.kernelnewbies.org/ (Thanks Ringo)

One Day One Command (By Mr Arpit Sud)
======================================

mogrify -- Mogrify an image

Summary:

Mogrify transforms an image or a sequence of images. These transforms
include image scaling, image rotation, color reduction, and others.

NOTE: The transmogrified image overwrites the original image, unless
an option such as -format causes the output filename to be different
from the input filename.

It is a part of the ImageMagick utilities (www.imagemagick.org).

Examples:

$ mogrify -format jpeg *.tiff -- Convert all the TIFF files in a 
                                 current Dir to JPEG.

$ mogrify -resize 120x120 +profile '*' *.png -- Convert all PNG files 
                                                to 120x120 Size.

It still doesn't solve the problem. The maximum number of entries is just 10
(for slashdot) in netvibes. It's worse than desktop rss clients. netvibes is
a nice web2.0 start page, that's it. Yes, for "casual" users, netvibes looks
cool, but so is Google - http://www.google.com/ig

On an impulse, party because I don't yet have too much data on my

Yup. Working. LCD on/off? Working. Thinklight? Working. Sound/Volume? 
Working. I was amazed I completed *all* my setup in under one hour. Now 
I know the reason:

http://www.ubuntulinux.org/community/teams/laptop

One warning, though: Debian is still king for server installs. You won't 
get that variety of packages in Ubuntu yet. But if you just want a 
desktop or laptop setup on Linux, I haven't seen anything better than 
Ubuntu so far. (Binand, hint, hint ;-).

Vamsee.

Hmm..is this relevant on this mailing even if it's an [OT].By the way
has IIT-JEE become institute specific(What is meant by "appearing for
IIT-M" ,hoping that M stands for Madras).

Isn't there any way out to remove such irrelevant mails?Administrators

Dear shakti,

My thoughts below,

I do acknowledge your concerns of little being done(by some of its
members) to spread linux or contributing to FLOSS activities. But
don't you think linux would spread ( should i say should speard) on
its own merits. Think of the day, what would happens if there not
enough linux supporters in TN. Would linux not exist in TN. Further
bandwith or load on the mailling list server at iitm should not be a
cause of serious concern so as to stop such posting. Definitely you &
me & many others over here are on broadband. Regarding load on iitm
server, there is not much traffic at iitm to cause concern. We
definetly don't get as many mails as at fedora or debian mail server (
AFAIK these distros are mainly community based with some industry
support). AFAIK server at iitm are sufficiently well built to handle
this traffic. The bandwith problems could true during the days of
dialup connection. I find that argument no longer holds true. I think
policing the list will not contribute to ilugc or linux.

with regards.

I reserve my comments on this - let me see how good OpenSuSE is :) I
certainly don't expect anything Debian-based to be easy to use.

Incidentally, thinklight etc. are purely hardware controlled and the

Hey all,

I've read this essay by Paul Graham in his book titled Hackers & Painters.
However, it is not available for public viewing in his website -
www.paulgraham.com, where his other essays are found. Googling around, I
found this oreillynet article and in fact, I was surprised!

This is a _must_ read for any entrepreneur! Read it here -

Yes, Check http://doondo.blogspot.com/. The entire project has been
developed by volunteers (Manu, Elango, Sujit) from their own comfortable
PC's, just like any other open source projects. We connect through IM and
mails.

The toughest part is getting the concept right - which will be ever
evolving. Anyway I'll right more about it at doondo club blog.

help) do let me know.

Plz clarify my doubts.
   
  1. I want to know if solaris 10 has good hardware compatiblity than Linux.
   
  2. Is there difference between the various Linux Distro in hardware compatiblity. Like for example, Redhat will support one device and SuSe won't support that device.

Let's get to the basics.

Distros differ mainly in their package management
system. Hardware support is dependant on the Linux
kernel, not the distro as such. What vendors do is
just pick a stock kernel (from kernel.org) and
customize it. Even then, you can still run different
kernels on different distros.

Hi,

Can anybody suggest some good rack mountable servers with raid support that
work out of
the box with Linux (prefably Debian stable/testing). We are going in for a
couple of new
file servers, one which would be also handling mail/web services, and we
would like to get
hardware that is known to work without issues.

*Year 2038..Again the replica of Y2K*

Note: This is just for FYI only, Please Don't try

network based applications will not work.

The Year 2038 Problem

Triaging steps...

1. login to yahoo messenger

2. send instant message to anyone - fine its

working...

3. now, change your system date to 19-Jan-2038,

03:14:07 AM or above

4. Confirm weather your date is changed

5. again send instant message to anyone...



Your YM crashes....



* * * YES ALL NETWORK BASED APPLICATION WILL NOT WORK

NOW * * *



*Why.....

What is it?*



Starting at GMT 03:14:07, Tuesday, January 19, 2038,

It is expected to see lots of systems around the world

breaking magnificently: satellites falling out of

orbit, massive power outages (like the 2003 North

American black out), hospital life support system

failures, phone system interruptions, banking errors,

etc. One second after this critical second, many of

these systems will have wildly inaccurate date

settings, producing all kinds of unpredictable

consequences. In short, many of the dire predictions

for the year 2000 are much more likely to actually

occur in the year 2038! Consider the year 2000 just a

dry run. In case you think we can sit on this issue

for another 30 years before addressing it, consider

that reports of temporal echoes of the 2038 problem

are already starting to appear in future date

calculations for mortgages and vital statistics!

In the first month of the year 2038 C.E. many

computers will encounter a date-related bug in their

operating systems and/or in the applications they run.

This can result in incorrect and wildly inaccurate

dates being reported by the operating system and/or

applications. The effect of this bug is hard to

predict, because many applications are not prepared

for the resulting "skip" in reported time anywhere

from 1901 to a "broken record" repeat of the reported

time at the second the bug occurs. Also, may make

some small adjustment to the actual time the bug

expresses itself. This bug to cause serious problems

on many platforms, especially Unix and Unix-like

platforms, because these systems will "run out of

time".

What causes it?

Time_t is a data type used by C and C++ programs to

represent dates and times internally. (Windows

programmers out there might also recognize it as the

basis for the CTime and CTimeSpan classes in MFC.)

time_t is actually just an integer, a whole number,

that counts the number of seconds since January 1,

1970 at 12:00 AM Greenwich Mean Time. A time_t value

of 0 would be 12:00:00 AM (exactly midnight)

1-Jan-1970, a time_t value of 1 would be 12:00:01 AM

(one second after midnig ht) 1-Jan-1970, etc..

some example times and their exact time_t

representations:

Date & time time_t representation

1-Jan-1970, 12:00:00 AM GMT 0

1-Jan-1970, 12:01:00 AM GMT 60

1-Jan-1970, 01:00:00 AM GMT 3 600

2-Jan-1970, 12:00:00 AM GMT 86 400

1-Jan-1971, 12:00:00 AM GMT 31 536 000

1-Jan-1972, 12:00:00 AM GMT 63 072 000

1-Jan-2038, 12:00:00 AM GMT 2 145 916 800

19-Jan-2038, 03:14:07 AM GMT 2 147 483 647

By the year 2038, the time_t representation for the

current time will be over 2 140 000 000. And that's

the problem. A modern 32-bit computer stores a "signed

integer" data type, such as time_t, in 32 bits. The

first of these bits is used for the positive/negative

sign of the integer, while the remaining 31 bits are

used to store the number itself.

The highest number these 31 data bits can store works

out to exactly 2 147 483 647. A time_t value of this

exact number, 2 147 483 647, represents Janu ary 19,

2038, at 7 seconds past 3:14 AM Greenwich Mean Time.

So, at 3:14:07 AM GMT on that fateful day, every

time_t used in a 32-bit C or C++ program will reach

its upper limit.

One second later, on 19-January-2038 at 3:14:08 AM

GMT, disaster  strikes.  When a signed integer reaches

its maximum value and then gets incremented, it wraps

around to its lowest possible negative value. This

means a 32-bit signed integer, such as a time_t, set

to its maximum value of 2 147 483 647 and then

incremented by 1, will become -2 147 483 648. Note

that "-" sign at the beginning of this large number. A

time_t value of -2 147 483 648 would represent

December 13, 1901 at 8:45:52 PM GMT.

So, if all goes normally, 19-January-2038 will

suddenly become 13-December-1901 in every time_t

across the globe, and every date calculation based on

this figure will go haywire. And it gets worse. Most

of the support functions that use t he time_t data type

cannot handle negative time_t values at all. They

simply fail and return an error code.

To both:

HP Proliant DL360 series servers are really, really good. 1U
rack-mountable servers, with 2 x U320 SCSI disks (more recently HP has
added a SATA option in their DL360 G4 series) in a hardware raid
config - you could use raid0 and get storage of both disks combined or
raid1 to get redundancy. HP's PSP (Proliant Support Pack) comes only
in RHEL or SLES versions, though. You might want to reconsider the
Distro. The amount of perfomance these servers give me are truly
amazing. Has lights-out management and WOL out of the box.

IBM and Dell are other options you can try.

NAS: Did you mean direct attached storage boxes? Any NAS box that
supports NFS/CIFS can be used with Linux.

hi evry1,
shakthi..correct me if i m wrong..doesnt different distros have
different styles for customizing the vannila kernel..if i can recollect,
back in fc1..my sound card simply refused to get detected but in
pcqlinux(a derivative of fc1)..it got detected outta the box..so wouldnt
there be a vast difference between two different distros like redhat and
suse when it comes to hardware compatibility..i mean when a vannila
kernel amounts to around 40 mb...there are complete distributions like
puppy dog, DSL which are just 50 mb in size..maybe they dropped certain
modules including stuff which you dont really need in a desktop env and
also some less popular hardware..assuming this wouldnt it be simply best
to go and compile from the stock kernel and suit it to our content
when there are big differences in the kernel itself..will there be a
change in how (say a ubuntu or debian) distributions work..comments
please

As on date and AFAIK, you can't run software in the
air. It has to run on some piece of hardware. Hence,
hardware is important and we cannot make assumptions
on it.

There is no style as such. They customize it, yes.
Sometimes, they don't even ship the sources in the
installation CD (was it FC3 or FC4?). So, when end
users try to build drivers, they are faced with
problems. Ok, things are good with Ubuntu and its
hardware detection, its an exception. Newbies also
forget to install gcc required for driver compilation.

Hence, its always good to use a stock kernel.

We can't keep track of all changes that distro folks
do, hence, it is always _recommended_ that you get the
stock kernel (kernel.org), compile it and use it.

You can customize it to your needs.

Not really. As mentioned in the release notes 
(http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/release-notes/fc4/#sn-kernel)  users dont 
need a source kernel to build drivers in 2.6 kernel.  Kernel drivers 
need to be in the upstream kernel and not distributed in separate 
packages ideally. Proprietary modules are one of the reasons why you 
need a external drivers which the upstream kernel does not support. In 
fact they are completely against the idea

http://lxr.linux.no/source/Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt

If thats really needed it is one of the repositories anyway and if you 
are looking for development. Whatever kernel headers required for module 
builders is usually in the kernel-devel package.

#yum install kernel-devel and off you go

More of these patches needs to be upstreamed.

You basically invalidate all the QA done on a distribution kernel by 
doing it.

Distribution patch kernels not for fun. There are specific reasons why 
thats required at times despite best efforts. Distribution schedule is 
not in sync with kernel release schedule for example and patches pending 
upstream might be in the distribution kernel. If the vendors patch for 
feature enhancements then many of user space tools might depend on such 
patches. fbsplash or software suspend for example.

Normally end users neednt be concerned with distribution specific 
patches. If they really need to its trivial to check the repository. For 
Fedora thats http://cvs.fedora.redhat.com.

I suppose an update is in order :)

The installation was a breeze - I booted into Knoppix, and used
ntfsresize to shrink the WinXP installation to 18GB - and then fdisk
to create space for Linux. This is NOT the recommended procedure for
newbies/intermediates - I personally found the interface of qtparted
clumsy, that's all :) Unless you have a complete understanding of
disks, partitions, volumes and whatnots, please do not attempt this
without parental guidance.

One difference I found in SuSE (as opposed to Redhat) is that after
installing stuff from CD1, the system reboots to the harddisk and
continues installation from there. Redhat/Fedora finishes off full
installation using as many CDs as required before rebooting to the
harddisk. I am not going to post screenshots or anything - didn't even
bother capturing any - several others have done it in far better ways.

Everything was autodetected. My e1000 network card, the CD writer (at
least, K3b shows the writer - I am yet to see if it actually manages
to write anything), sound system (haven't tested the microphone yet -
midweek here, can't fiddle around too much). The docking station could
be configured (sorry for the false alarm earlier today, folks!) using
YaST - "second monitor/keyboard/mouse". I still haven't figured out
how to blank out the LCD when I use the docking station.

Wifi has been a disappointment. First of all, it seems that
configuring WPA is a challenge (all access points I use require WPA,
except the T-Mobile hotspots which are open anyway). Secondly, I seem
to have hit upon a bug either in SuSE's packaging or ipw2100 itself -
"ipw2100-1.3.fw is not available or load failed". So I am still in
WinXP at home, typing this. A colleague pointed me here:
http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/

It was far easier to configure my two important network drives - a
CIFS share and a DAV one - in Konqueror than it was in Windows.

More later. The next update should be from Linux. :)

My actual question is, does Solaris supports most of the newly available hardware than Linux. Like, Soundcard, AGP, etc

Firmware failure may be due to two reasons. One is if there is wireless
on/off switch in laptop, that might have not enabled in linux.  second
reason is path of firmware. the path of firmware typically stored in
/etc/hotplug/firmware.agent file. your ipw2100 firmware should be
available in that part.

When I try to compile this code on Solaris platfrom(SPARC

On/off switch? for in-built wireless?

Can you post the link to your current kernel .config
file. You will need to have:

  CONFIG_FW_LOADER 

set in the kernel:

Device Drivers -> Generic Driver Options -> Hotplug
firmware loading support

My assumption is that SuSE distribution kernel does
not have it enabled by default.

Just follow the instructions from here:

http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net/INSTALL

Yes.

>From the INSTALL file:

"You need to place all of these files into the hotplug
firmware directory, e.g. /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/ 
or  /lib/firmware/.  Check the contents of the
/etc/hotplug/firmware.agent to determine the specific
location for your distribution. "

I use /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware on Debian.

SK

Hi,

I was troubleshooting a linux machine and noted that they have mounted the 
whole device without partitioning it.
ie., like "mount /dev/sdb /mnt" instead of "mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt".

Is it advisable to do the above? and what are the probable issues related 
with it. I thought it was not possible to do that.

thanks

The code has a makefile which is interpreted correctly by the gmake and the

Yes. My HP Compaq nx6120 laptop does have that kind of switch (aka KILL
switch) which enable / disable Wireless and Bluetooth. When I press the
key, a indicator light glows showing that the wireless/bluetooth on. We
have to pass this information as a parameter to ipw2100 module (same
case for ipw2200 also).

You can take it from me that the T41 does not have such a switch. I
have a PCMCIA 3Com Wifi card which does have an extensible antenna
which sort of behaves as an on/off switch, though.

is it a tarball or just a piece of C code ?
if it is a tarball the header file discrepency should be handled by automake
and autoconf tools provided the developer has implemented it.
if its a single C code.. then try changing the make.h to corresponding
header that solaris supports.

just put in your RW and mount it. after mounting it use dd command to create
a image of the entire disk (RW) in your hard drive. use strings to retrive
the data. but this would work if you have data in the text form.

If you did  a fast erase using k3b .. It would have deleted only the index
files. You will still have the files untouched. If you did a complete
erase.. then its difficult.

Your Makefile uses GNU Make extensions which are not supported on
Solaris make. Your best bet is to download GNU Make from
www.sunfreeware.com and use it to build the software.

Some reading online provided these:

Its actually an RF kill switch. 

http://rfswitch.sourceforge.net/

Some implement with software, some in hardware, and
others don't. As mentioned, HP nx6120 has it, and the
T41 doesn't.

That is perfectly valid. It only means that the filesystem occupies
the entire media.
This is what happens typically for a USB stick.

Hi all,

Any python programmers willing to work for yoper?.

Currently we are developing Yoper Installer which is coded in PyQt. If
anybody interested, please reply to my mail - chaks.yoper@gmail.com

The Yoper Installer is 97% done and only few things are left for the first
release and is handled by me.

I would be happy if friends could join with me.

use "cvs import " to initially check in files into cvs repositories.
refer to the man page for complete syntax.

If you are new to versioning, I'd recommend
subversion. 

Ok, this is not a solution to your query, its just my
suggestion.

maybe u should try 'cvs add gui.c' and the 'cvs commit' in case gui.c
was not part of the initial project u imported

Message-ID: <20051223183515.48792.qmail@web50207.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

There were discussions in Indian GNU/Linux Users'
Group, Mumbai on where to have the January month's
meeting. 

I had an idea. What if all our FSUGs/GLUGs members
from all over India meet together, online?. How would
it be if we all meet in the beginning of the New Year?


After discussion with the channel ops, I am happy to
call for an all-India FSUGs/GLUGs members meet on
January 1, 2006 at 1500 hrs IST at #gnu-india on
irc.freenode.net.

No agenda as such. The idea is to get to meet folks
from different FSUGs/GLUGs, get to know what
FSUGs/GLUGs have been and are working on, free
software ideas/suggestions/plans/activities for 2006. 

I will broadcast this message to as many FSUGs/GLUGS
that I am member of and that I know of. Please feel
free to spread the word. 

Thanking you all and looking forward to meeting you
all,

SK 
(a.k.a mbuf on irc.freenode.net)

FC 4 CDs' for 600/-.Isn't it a bit costlier -1CD @ 150/-? In a
GNU/Linux user mailing list I can understand someone advertising for
Free Software collection CDs or GNU/Linux distribution CDs but
advertising for non-free(as in freedom) softwares seem wierd.
What other members think?

This is plain robbery. The money being asked for is not worth the service
offered(burning the cds and cd cost). Opt for CDs for Grab. And this post
should have been labelled [Commercial].

Graet idea. Just for confirmation the meet would be IRC
irc.freenoode.net at channel #gnu-india on 1st jan 3pm IST. It would
be great if others could mail in their nickname under which they would
appearing online or post thier nickname at ilugc wiki. mail in the
link. Just my thoughts, this should not stop the face to face meet at
ma foi or iitm.

Hello Sud,

Kindly follow the below link. I found it very useful to use cvs. Though I 
dont use it locally but thru network.

http://www.linux.ie/articles/tutorials/cvs.php

If you are gonna add a new project then
cvs import <project name> <Ur-Comp-tag-anything> start

then cvs checkout <module-name>

then cvs add <file to be added>

//Now it will be scheduled

then its cvs commit !!

Everything goes on cvs repositry :).

Also Eclipse IDE has got good binding with CVS I guess.. May be u can try 
it..

Cheers,
Aanjhan

Subject: [Ilugc] Compilation warning in Solaris
Message-ID: <72a9b0620512240124n1c650ed7oe6ba6a7639f6ac9d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

 I have a c code which successfully compiles on RedHat platform (gcc
and 32 bit processor). The same code I tried to compile on Solaris
platform (64 bit SPARC).
It throughs the following warning.

 warning: cast increases required alignment of target type

The code is some thing like this:
struct y{
signed int a1;
....
...
};
struct x {
struct y *header
unsigned char * data
};
unsigned short * Buf
struct x * packet;

packet=(struct x *)malloc (sizeof(struct x));
Buf = (unsigned short *) packet->header;

Last line results in warning. struct x and struct y has bigger size
than unsigned short.

Can any body tell me why this warning is coming?

Thanks and Regards
Muneer CH

It should throw a warning on Redhat too. Try compiling with gcc -Wall.

> Can any body tell me why this warning is coming?

It is obvious, isn't it? You have pointed it out yourself. Your Buf
needs to be a struct y * or void * - I really don't know why you have
chosen unsigned short *.

Secondly, it is bad programming practice to cast the return value from
malloc(). Drop it.

Thirdly, the way you have presented your code, you know that it will
coredump if you try to dereference Buf, right?

Ofcourse I am compiling on Redhat with this option. No warnings.

Leave the logic of the program I provided. It is only a sampling of my
big code. I just wanted to tell you what I really did. I type casted a
pointer to bigger type to a lower type. What is the reason for warning
here?

Other wise it will be a void * rt? Don't you feel a mismatch of type
in RH and LH?

It is not a complete code. Just a sample to tell you what the problem
is. Ofcourse, I forgot to allocate packet->pheader.

Tell me how can I remoce this warning, without changing the types of
variables...

Hmm. I just noticed that -Wcast-align is not included in -Wall in gcc.

The struct x you posted is not complete. I cannot reproduce this
warning on x86 Linux and Sparc64 Solaris9. Are you using gcc on
Solaris or Sun's own?

No.

Lower the warning threshold on your compiler? This particular warning
is usually a symptom of SIGBUS during execution, though.

And some politeness will not hurt, especially if someone's trying to

I am really sorry if you felt bad. I didn't think in that way. It is
my mistake. Thanks a lot for spending your valuable time for me.
By the way can you explain what is SIGBUS? And is that warning a
harmful one? Can I just ignore it?

This is day light robbery. 600 for fc4. Its understand that they d/l &
burn the cd & they charge money for them but 600 is far too much for 5
cds. This is robbery. I had broadband & bsnl offered free unlimited
d/l during 3 months( i am not sure) & i d/l & burned the iso images. I
installed the os from burned CDs & its up and running for the past 6
months in my desktop. I have also burned the fc to cds for other for
free. 600 is way too high.

This is not fair. For burning 4 cds is this the cost??? I also burn
cds for people in Madurai free of cost (I get empty cds from those who
request). Why people are so crazy about getting so much money, after
being a part of Free software groups???

I dont get what point does this make for the community and is it
relevant to this mailing list???

hello,
silly me..i didnt do the cvs import...solved the problem..I now have
both cvs and svn installed (although i suppose almost all FLOSS projects
use cvs)..
Now I am just a novice programmer. Can anyone suggest some good
resources for developing my programming skills. Like websites that has
some good puzzles. Googling shows results that are way beyond my level.
Also reading stuff from books is damn boring and monotono us. I really
want to hone my skills and contrbute to FLOSS community.
Prashanth has already suggested one from Peking Univ site

Message-ID: <c0b743a40512250940o4ec83feaj856843f88920ce1b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
I have airtel DSL connection and a USB modem (Beetel 100CX). The person who
installed the modem said that it has no drivers for Linux. But i found this
eciadsl website. I downloaded the driver for slackware(10.2, i patched the
kernel to 2.6). I also got the article which described how to configure the
driver, i tried it and executed all the steps. But when i tried to start the
modem, it didn't do so and it exit. It chose a synch file(synch02) and
didn't give any errors till then. I want to configure internet in Linux
badly. Does anyone here have the same modem and have configured the driver,
can you please help me with it? I am open to any sugestions and advises.

It was troublesome with Mac OS X as well as my OpenSUSE, so I bugged them
(Airtel) and got an ethernet modem which is, detected by both the OSes.

Hi,

There is a GUI tool called 'lincvs' for cvs clients,
Install this and connect to your cvs server. It show
clearly what a command will do when it is executed
(clicked) by you in the log.

you can learn more from the log.

Message-ID: <d59d94320512260459n742b375flcccfdc0f60ab26fb@mail.gmail.com>

i tried creating foreign key in mysql,but i was not able to create it.
the query i used was..

      "create table parent(id int not null, primary key(id))type=innodb;"

      "create table child (childid int, index(childid),foriegn key(childid)
references parent(id))type=innodb;"

It keeps inserting values not in parent table.
Is this the way to create foreign key in mysql.
Are there any configuration details to be modified.

Message-ID: <dc538c3f0512260911y1044dea5led6479213f10a5f8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Yesterday , i installed OpenSuse Desktop at my work place. I wonder
how it went well without any problem. Since i did Internet
installation, i was surprised to see. Simple installation screen, Good
GUI, more professional etc. I just downloaded internet installation
iso image and invoked that from GRUB and started with installation. at
first, it gives me CUI. somewhat i managed and succeeeded in
installing after whole day downloading more than G's. Atlast i was
asked to give instructions to the installaer and it succeeded the
installation. The Bootloader is good at GUI. When i went into the
login screen, i was surprised to see something like Windows XP Login
screen, Pleasant Color Combination, eye catching and to say simple
"it's sexy". I liked it very much. YAST Tool is good for newbies. I
can suggest for newbies that they should try OpenSuse 10 and try to
feel the power of Openness.

OpenSuse the Great :)

I run OpenSUSE on my eMac (PPC), its really worth trying it.  Especially the
ease of installation and configuration (Ubuntu really lacks the configuration
during setup).

Why only newbies?  Is it necessary that experienced users should use only
command-line tools?

Probably. I'd say one of the distinguishing feaures of the really
advanced user is indeed an affinity for command-line tools - not just
in Linux, but for every piece of equipment out there that has a TCP/IP
stack.

And also to be able to appreciate the cool GUIs, I guess. I do like to use
the
command line, as it is a lot easier if you know the commands. This, I have
experienced very recently while trying to latch on to some secure WiFi
networks. It
was really painful going through all the dialogs (needn't necessarily be
windows,
even ubuntu has some similar GUI) to set up the WiFi link, whereas it takes
just a
one line command if you have iwconfig!

Dear All,

My System configuration are

Processor => AMD Athelon 64 bit
MotherBoard => GigaByte
Hard disk => SATA enabled Hard disk,

I tried to install red hat 10.  It throws an error message as " No device
has found" . That is, the harddisk could not recognize due to the SATA
connection.

Could you please help me out to solve this problem.

I would like to install linux .  Does SATA problem come for other linux os
like SUSE or FEDORO


Thanks in advance,

Depends on whom you are referring to as "experienced"
users, and what they use the system for.

When we work with embedded systems/VLSI, boards
provide us with a serial port interface and we get to
use the command line on busybox. IMHO, the power of
the command line cannot be matched with anything else.

Just my thoughts,

SK

Check your boot options when booting. You are probably
booting with a 2.4 kernel. 2.6 kernels have SATA
support built-in.

I use Debian on SATA hard disks. No problems. I booted
with linux26 in the boot: option during installatino.

IMO the type of use will define whether commandline or GUI is
appropriate. However, anyone wanting to learn computers will do well
to learn the shell well. It gives a perspective to the system innards
that the GUI deftly hides.

First impression: Notwithstanding all the claims they have in their
About Us page, I think it is just a front-end to a lot of web
services. Taking their own example query, Java, I get a page that
says:

The term Java can refer to:

In geography:
[snip]
# In computer science:
[snip]
# Java may also mean:
[snip]

Which looks suspiciously identical to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java

Then, looking at the search result, the "archived" link is to the
wayback machine. Rest of it is all just what is in Google ("Similar
Pages" => "Find more like this", "More results from www.fubar.com" =>
"more from this site").

They do a bit of Google bashing, of course. When they say: "On Google,
if you were interested in Java the island, you would have to click
through over 70 pages of irrelevant results for 'java' before getting
to your very first relevant result", they really lack a clue - the
first result on Google for "java island" is the 100% relevant
Wikipedia entry for the island.

Among the other claims they have:

"It visits all the major search engines on your behalf" - does this
mean that the actual search is done by Google and the like? A9 or
Metacrawler, anyone?

BTW, what is redhat 10, fedoro? last redhat series i know was redhat 9
after that it was either the enterprise ver like rhel, ws, etc or the
free ver. like fedora core. Am i wrong here? AFAIK all mordern distro
come with sata support enabled which includes fc4.

FYI I've been using GNU/Linux for the past seven years, and I do use the
command line many a times.  So, my point is that "experienced" users need not
use the command line all the time, like for example, for stop/start the
network, I find it easy to click on the "Network" icon in the panel (GNOME)
rather than opening a terminal and running "sudo /etc/init.d/network restart".

That claim seems to be true. For a number of queries, I could find the
similarity
with the corresponding wiki pages. Some simple queries like man, pet,
rose... also fetched identical photos as in the wiki.

The service seems identical to clusty.com but with additional intelligence which
is only a nice thing. When the standards are set high and when there
is competition, then we can expect more nice features from the loved

yes, open suse is no doubt the best newbie distribution , no doubt in it,
some of them argued with me about ubuntu, but after switching to UBUNTU, i
found it to be false,
the main advantage for a newbie in suse is , the YAST, the answer for every
problem.

Are the modem lights blinking/on?

if not, you have to run 'eciadsl-probe-device'.
then you have to run 'eciadsl-start'

Subject: [Ilugc] CD-ROM mount problem
Message-ID: <20051227182258.89682.qmail@web51912.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi All,
I am running Debian. GNOME desktop.
Until recently my /dev/cdrom was pointing to /dev/hdc.
After removing the extra hard-disk & reconnecting the
CD-ROM drive
/dev/cdrom was supposed point to /dev/hdd. But it was
still /dev/hdc.
So, I did the following
rm /dev/cdrom
ln -s /dev/hdd /dev/cdrom
chown :cdrom /dev/cdrom

But now automatic mounting does not work.
Only root is able to mount/umount it (previously any
user could)
Also the CD-ROM's icon does not appear on the desktop.
The 'chown :cdrom /dev/cdrom' is not effective after
reboot.

Could anyone please help me solve this problem?

Thanks & Regards,
Ram

the innodb feature may not be enabled by default.
to enable the innodb feature remove the "skip-innodb"
line from the mysql configuration file my.cnf and try adding
the following lines then restart the mysql server.

# location where mysql database is stored
innodb_data_home_dir = /var/lib/mysql/
innodb_data_file_path = ibdata1:10M:autoextend
innodb_log_group_home_dir = /var/lib/mysql/
innodb_log_arch_dir = /var/lib/mysql/

# You can set .._buffer_pool_size up to 50 - 80 %
# of RAM but beware of setting memory usage too high
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 16M
innodb_additional_mem_pool_size = 2M

# Set .._log_file_size to 25 % of buffer pool size
innodb_log_file_size = 5M
innodb_log_buffer_size = 8M
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1
innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 50


These details could be found in the sample configuration file.
In debian i found these details in
/usr/share/doc/mysql-server/examples/my-small.cnf file.

He may be an newbie. I hope, by now, you may seen his "sorry" reply.  
This is how people will learn. We are here to help/guide them, not to
penalize. Thats why myself and DPS (Dr P Sriram) are not interested in
moderating the ILUGC posts.

I used to send personal mails to guys, who reply/send with digest

I am CCing this mail to list. So that our members will know about

Hello, I did reply to you yesterday.

Anyways, if you have installed from source (assuming MySQL user/group is
mysqluser, otherwise don't pass the --user argument), you can start MySQL
using:

shell> sudo /path/to/mysqld_safe --user=mysqluser &

or, if you did a binary installation, you can start MySQL using:

shell> sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
(at least on SUSE).

The MySQL team has taken pains to write an excellent documentation, please take
some time to read it:

  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/

Message-ID: <20051230193703.GA28279@mrna.tn.nic.in>

hi all,
we are planning to migrate to 64 bit architecture from 32 bit for scientific computing for our servers.
i need a suggestion or remarks abt AMD Opteron series  vs Intel Xeon processors.
As most of our applications are memory intensive and 32 bit processor based, and since AMD Opteron series talks abt simultaneous 32 and 64 bit functionality, i want to know in practice if any issues not to be overlooked while migrating to it.
In this connection, which GNU/Linux  flavour is best suited for 64 bit computing ? any recommendations ?

advice appreciated.
regards,
KM

The 32 bit program runs in 64 bit address space as far as the specs of AMD opteron says. my  requirement is for a SERVER which can handle huge datasets in memory (> 4 GB), computation, and databases; ofcourse it will be a production system.
Now, are there any advantages (performance wise or other) to run 32 bit applications in 64 bit environment apart from huge addressable space and high precision computation ?
'AMD Opteron' specs say that 32 & 64 bit programs can simultaneously coexist, allowing for a smooth transition to 64 bit architecture while considering overall deployment costs, but in practice i dont know the bottlenecks. any ideas over this? 
well i need some feed back on Intel Xeon dual processor (64 bit)  also, if someone has deployed so for scientific application of 32 bit.

>I have fc3 running and i feel that there was no big deal gettin only the OS 64 bit, since the supplied packages in x86-64 arent great, some are crash prone. If they mature, then my system shd easily beat a PIV running around 3 Ghz.

heard fc4  is more stable  and faster than fc3 ?

I have an Athlon 64 that had 64 bit Ubuntu running on it for some time. Most
applications and the kernel itself were 64 bit. For applications like
flash, java and
OO, which don't have 64 bit versions yet I used a chrooted environment
with the 32
bit libraries. One day when I wanted to update to the latest version
of the distro, I
found it was too much a time to waste on a home system maintaining two sets of
libraries, so I am currently running only the 32 bit version and quite happy.

I am planning to follow this stratergy untill the time when 64 bit
processors will
become more common and have their due respect.

Fedora, if i am right follows a different architecture and don't need
a chroot, the
libraries have different naming convention and can happily exist side-by-side.

The moral of the story is, Check if all the applications you need have a 64 bit
version and that you are picking the right distro.

forgive me for this silly question.. so can i still install an ubuntu
x86 (32 bit) in a 64 bit processor without any problems..if thats true i
think i can coax my dad into buying me an athlon 64 whilst still keeping
my data and downloaded binaries intact and using them without any
problems on 64 bit box. well, then i need not reinstall the OS if I am
moving from my existing athlon-xp to athlon 64

Athlon 64 is complete binary compatible with 32 bit applications, so you can
install 32 bit applications without any modification.

i doesnt matter if they repeat mistakes once or twice - in the long 
run, if they are encouraged by responses on the list and remain, 
they learn - we should gently hook newbies, get the addicted to the 
list and then flame them if necessary. At that stage they will take 
it and not vote with their feet.

I don't have the commands 'service' or 'automount'.
Do they come with debian?

> insert a

This is in my fstab:

bigblackbox:~# cat /etc/fstab | grep cdrom
/dev/cdrom      /media/cdrom0   iso9660 ro,user,noauto
 0       0

Though it is noauto, the cdrom is mounted
automatically(!)
when I insert a cd into the drive. I am able to browse
/media/cdrom0
through nautilus.
The entry in /etc/mtab also confirms this:

bigblackbox:~# cat /etc/mtab | grep cdrom
/dev/cdrom /media/cdrom0 iso9660
ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec 0 0

Though the CD has mounted, the icon that should come
on the gnome desktop
does not appear.

Also when I try to umount the cdrom there is an error:
bigblackbox:~# umount /dev/cdrom
umount: /dev/cdrom: not mounted

This is quite contrary to what /etc/mtab says.

When I try to umount using the following command there
is an error
(see below):
bigblackbox:~# umount /media/cdrom0
umount: /media/cdrom0: device is busy
umount: /media/cdrom0: device is busy

To find which process is keeping the CD busy, I did
this:
bigblackbox:~# find /proc -lname "*cdrom*" 2>/dev/null
/proc/2779/task/2779/fd/95

bigblackbox:~# ls -al /proc/2779/task/2779/fd/95
lr-x------  1 root root 64 2005-12-29 21:38
/proc/2779/task/2779/fd/95 -> /media/cdrom0

bigblackbox:~# ps -ef | grep 2779
ram       2779     1  0 21:14 ?        00:00:00
/usr/sbin/famd -T 0

So I guess that famd is doing the mount and blocking
the umount.
All this didn't happen until the CD-ROM drive changed
from hdc to hdd.

Any suggestions on how to solve this?

Thank you for the information.  I'll forward the news to other mailing 
lists that would find the articles and site interesting and useful too.  
It is heartening to know that the Allahabad High Court is using free and 
open software and standards so extensively. If I may say so, the 
articles by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Yatindra Singh have approached free 
software from a neutral point of view and present a fair picture to the 
reader. 

In the talk titled "OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
RIGHTS" delivered by Justice Yatindra Singh at NALSAR Hyderabad and NLS, 
Bangalore and NUJS, Kolkata, Linus Torvalds has been quoted from "Just 
for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary' as
saying:

"The GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best 
technology.
... It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with
interest won't be excluded from its development.

So open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an 
invitation
to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others. It's still 
the same old
mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level."

The quote captures the key IPR feature central to free software, and 
makes the legal intricacies involved superfluous.
The practical reasons why many prefer to use free software is succintly 
summarised in the following words:

"I shifted to GPLed software few years ago: the reasons were practicable.
GPLed software comes without any cost. And it does what I do--word 
processing,
playing music, watching Video, surfing internet,and electronically 
managing my
calendar --as well as any other proprietary software."

More generally, the observations on using computers in the talk titled 
"IT: The Road to Speedier Justice" is remarkable:

"Computers are like 'English butlers'.  They have to be told what to do 
and they do it in that way and no other way. Computers love routine and 
are never bored. But to achieve any success the minds of the judges, 
lawyers, and court employees have to be streamlined into a method. One 
has to leave individualism. The reports cannot be generated unless data 
is fed into computers; they will not have any meaning unless they are 
utilised and goals are fixed. And above all, if there is no will to 
change, no orientation to the work culture, then nothing can work."

Sacrificing individuality is a small price to pay for the larger 
benefits received in return by the general public.  Probably NRC-FOSS ( 
http://www.au-kbc.org/nrcf/index.htm )could include some of the articles 
as part of the curriculum for students.  Public institutions that have 
not yet adopted free software practices need to wake up now.

Thanks,
Ramanraj K

Message-ID: <20051230050603.85977.qmail@web51614.mail.yahoo.com>

I am doing php coding and in that for uploading a file
and downloading it I have error. Can any one guide me
in coding this.

My Requirement:
  In first page I should attach a file ( of all types
including doc/images etc)
  After attaching the file name which has been
downloaded must appear like a link to that file and
when we click that link the download/Save window
should open which prompts us for downloading that
particular file.

In the next page I should be able to pass this
particular file like an attachment. How is it
possible.

Any Ideas??

Help will be appreciated

this is not a php problem - it is just html, you need to create a 
form like so:

<form enctype="multipart/form-data", method="post" 
action="somescript>
<input type="file" name="file_to_upload"/>
</form>

and then process the POST data

second link for the keyword 'php file upload' gives you the code you need
for this step.
http://www.tizag.com/phpT/fileupload.php

  After attaching the file name which has been

<?php  print("<a href=\"$file_location_on_the_server\">Click here</a>

use the same variable $file_location_on_the_server here also.

Any Ideas??

Hi Friends,

Greetings, I  thought that it will be nice to have a band for Open source.
Some of our forum members may be good in music composition,lyrics ,
synthesizing and recording to contribute the skills in making an album of
songs. We can then produce some good albums on open source.Album will depict
the concept, principles, features and happenings in the open source world.
If we have some songs in local languages it will spur the drive  inculcating
open source in general public. Some time ago, i thought of making 'villu
pattu' on open source.

Music is the movement of sound to reach the soul for the education of its
virtue

Hi,
I use debian sarge on a intel845 P4 system. Keyboard:Samsung
KB-9885(just an extra info, if in case...)
I encountered a strange problem yesterday. This happened all of a
sudden. I was in Gnome and using Openoffice to type a document, and
was using mplayer as well(info for, just in case if any of these apps
cause some buffer overflow or any such things to cause this....).
Everything was fine(So dont ask me if keyboard was working in Gnome
previously). Suddenly I wasn't able to type anything.I just thought
that it was some problem with openoffice initially, byut after
sometime i found that i'm no longer able to  use keyboard especially
in Gnome. When I switch to another window manager( now I use xfce,
everything seems fine).

One similar post was found on googling, but unanswered

Not sure if this would help though, did you try moving out your ".gnome2", etc
directories and restarting GNOME?

songs?...they are really attractive and groovy...if we have like those..i
think we can attract people..

Subject: [Ilugc] Audio Driver Config.
Message-ID: <ff7d96f20512302115t2ef6b88oee12100eeb85c687@mail.gmail.com>

hello all,
i'd recently posted asking for audio drivers for the Intel-915 Chipset. It
was suggested that i "apt-get linux-image-2.686" After much trouble(which
included changind my usb modem to a router :) i tried apt-getting
linuximage2.6.12 now i found that my debian sarge had only a
kernel-image-2.612 and i installed a 686 version of it (my processor is a P$
3ghz). After all this i still find that my audio is not working.
I then downloaded some audio driver from the ointel site . It now seems to
have messed up with my mouse confid. and my x is not starting in 386 kernerl
image. I have lost 300 MB so far and i;m still going down :( some body help
out.

Well," said Owl, "the customary procedure in such cases is as follows."
"What does Crustimoney Proseedcake mean?" said Pooh. "For I am a Bear of
Very Little Brain, and long words Bother me."
"It means the Thing to Do."
"As long as it means that, I don't mind," said Pooh humbly.

> maybe you ran out of memory

I've got 376MB of RAM and 1 GB of SWAP. So running out of memory is
least possible.
I'm unable to use my keyboard everytime I enter Gnome. It beeps
whenever I press any button.
