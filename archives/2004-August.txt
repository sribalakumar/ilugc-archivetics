Subject: [Ilugc] Larger sized binaries (gentoo)
Message-ID: <8816fcf8040801005726cc57fd@mail.gmail.com>

The reason why '''gentoo binaries''' are very large is due to gcc
optimization flags.  Most people use -O3 resulting in heavy binaries. 
 Firefox (compiled with -O3 -march=pentium4) usually opens much slower
then.  But now when I installed gentoo with -mcpu=i686, -O2, mozilla
is much faster in every aspect than firefox.  Still to complie
firefox.  Hope that would be much more faster.  So, gentoo users!
unless you have enough RAM don't use optimization options like -O3.  I
even don't use -O2, but -Os.

More on
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.0/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Optimize%20Options/

Well, I think this clears Raman's doubt about large binaries in gentoo.

Do be careful - compiling with a higher level of optimization just might 
lead to unstable and crash prone binaries in some cases.

Yes, that's why I changed my CFLAGS to
CFLAGS="-Os -march=pentium4 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe"

(Pentium IV)

Message-ID: <20040801182429.E07AB101C9@ws1-3.us4.outblaze.com>

Hi,
   I recently downloaded a recent version of smartmontools for my Redhat 9(Shrike). The name of the rpm is smartmontools-5.32-1.i386.rpm. I installed the package using rpm -Uvh <package>. I read the man pages of smartctl & tried smartctl -[options]. But none of them worked, the shell prompt returned with saying "bash: smartctl: command not found". I tried running the commmand from /usr/sbin, also as superuser, but not helped. Any suggestions.

                                     Thank You,

Almost completing the system upgrade and remerging of important
packages (glibc, gcc, xorg, ...) with new CFLAGS.  It really works. 
Firefox opens much faster than it ever does even when compiling a
program in background.  Memory used is *much much* less.  All these
are the effect of the great

        -Os

CFLAG.

Of course, if you have enough RAM (unlike me who got struck with 128
MB), then you should try some of the big guns like -O2 and perhaps
-O3.

Now my gentoo box is far more great in terms of performance when
compared to slack, debian, ....

as well as stripping hand compiled binaries when you install them, if your install scripts in gentoo don't do this for you.

Many programmes by default installs to /usr/local/bin. Checkup there.
You may also issue

rpm -ql smartmontools  

to get list of files installed by this software.

the objective of building a framework, which can be used by any software
developer to incorporate speech capabilities (in Indian languages) into
her/his software thus increasing its usability across different sections
of society. Since Matrubhasha uses Unicode text, it enables the TTS engine

Its pretty simple in php :

<?php
session_start();
session_register('user_name');
$user_name = 'suresh'
?>

page2.php
-----------
<?php
session_start();
/**

echo "username = $_SESSION[user_name]";

It does that too.  Usually this can be done running 'make
install-strip' instead of 'make install'

Could you provide the details on the modem ?
Modem Make and chipset.
To find this, run usbview on you X desktop and attach the modem.
It will display a lot of detials. just paste those details and we'll locate the driver for it.

In general, that's correct.  But I can't seem to find any advantages
of using PHP over Python for web programming.  It's not only the
number that matters.

I guess there would be a few people here having accounts on symonds.net
and would have public key authentication working. I have an account in
symonds.net and I am unable to do public key authentication in SSH. 

This is what I did

$ ssh-keygen -t dsa
$ ssh-copyid -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub symonds.net
     (The above command copies the contents of id_dsa.pub to
      ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote machine)

But I am not able to login without a password. The same thing works when
logging to a machine in my school.

At my home
$ ssh -V

Hi,

Please ensure the following.

a) The permission for ~/.ssh/ directory is 700
b) The permission for ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file is 600
c) You are trying puggy.symonds.net not symonds.net, unless you have an
entry in your /etc/hosts.

IIAC,at symonds.net
$ ssh -V
ssh: SSH Secure Shell 3.2.0 (non-commercial version) on
i686-pc-linux-gnu

Hope it helps.

I am trying symonds.net. My /etc/hosts has no special entry (I can ping
both symonds.net and puggy.symonds.net). In puggy.symonds.net, I am not
able to even login. When I login to symonds.net, it logs me to
shire.symonds.net. Here are the IP addresses

symonds.net         69.93.152.234

Message-ID: <410F272D.2060608@fastmail.fm>

Hi Luggers,

    If there are any Emacs fans out here, I have a doubt: How do you 
force a file to be syntax-highlighted? Suppose, I'm setting up my jsp 
files to be loaded in sgml-mode like this:

(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\.jsp$"  . sgml-mode))
                auto-mode-alist))

    I'm also using desktop-save to open all my buffers when I start 
emacs. So, when I start emacs, all .java files are syntax highlighted, 
but jsp files are not. But if I open any new jsp files, they're being 
fontified. What do I do to make emacs fontify jsp files like .java files?

TIA,
Vamsee.

Dear all,
I need a help,
I have installed RHEL AS 3.0 on Compaq/HP Proliant ML 570 G2. Operating
system is working fine. Now I installed oracle 9i Database on that
server.
For oracle applications, I installed RHEL on Compaq Proliant DL 360
(Currently we are using Novell OS for users authentication and as well
as application server). Now I need the solution, how to authenticate
users (windows based clients) on this Linux server and also how to
change the password user themselves from their windows machine. Could
anyone help me regarding this issue? I am waiting for your reply. Thank
you.

With regards,

 You wanted to map some share of Linux, then you can use Samba.
 If you have pdc, then samba can be one of the member or you
 can setup samba as PDC.

 You can setup LDAP on Linux and configure clients.

Hi Suresh,

    Apparently, the code you sent needs htmlize, I downloaded htmlize.el 
from one of the gnu sites. But still, it doesn't fontify on startup. 
Also,  when I open a new jsp file, it doesn't fontify anymore (this used 
to work when I had those 3 lines I wrote before). Elisp is almost greek 
to me, I can't figure out what is going wrong.

TIA,
Vamsee.

how can someone else give you his or her .config file ?
their architecture would differ from yours...
Why dont you recompile your kernel and then the file would automatically
get created.

Hi Sridhar

Hathway has similar plan which looks like somewhat 
lesser than sify. I am currently using the plan chalked 
out below.

	o 1 Gig d/l limit
	o 24/7 net access
	o 1 free 10 MB mailbox ( @ hathway.com )
	o 128 kbps
	o Initial deposit of Rs.2500 + other costs.
	o Rs.1500 pm
	o Webstar cable modem ( max 10 Mbps )

I'm enjoying the guaranteed speed and their 24/7 
customer support is so far so good. 

Do someone see bandwidth difference in linux -n- windows 
when it comes to cable internet ? I saw another mail
thread talking about unlimited usage. Do we have any
such concept for soho broadband internet users in chennai ?

Thanks,
Gan.

Looking at the customer ramblings at

I think it's not going to be of any use with latest sify broadband offers.

VCD is a multi-session disc and hence you need to
convert it to another format before copying them to
hard disk (although you will be able to play them
directly from the drive).

Your options are:
vcdxrip - to rip the VCD tracks to mpeg
cdrdao - to create a bin cd image
mencoder - to convert VCD to divx

More than the language itself (or the numbers), it's the platform that
matters.  Python has Zope and Twisted, which are excellent environments
for developing medium/large web applications.

For instance Zope offers-
    1.  Excellent security model that's really easy to use.
    2.  Protocol transparency (your python methods can be invoked over
        HTTP, XML-RPC, etc).
    3.  Object persistence.
    4.  The builtin Zope Object Database.
    5.  Transactionally safe object database.
    6.  Cool features such as heirarchies and acquisition.
    7.  ...

Twisted is similar framework but focusing developing custom network
servers and other apps.

I'm not aware of such extensive development environments for PHP.

the .config file is generated once you do a 'make config' or 
'make menuconfig' or 'make xconfig'. it contains a record of 
what features you have configured :

	o to be included in the kernel statically
	o to be built as modules
	o to be ignored

its always better to generate your own .config file rather
than borrow from others, as it will ensure that you don't have
any problem while compiling the kernel.

alternatively, if you have the CD from where you had installed
linux, chances are that you will find the .config file of the 
default kernel provided by that distro in the CD. RedHat provides.
That will be safe to use as well.

The sizes of various basic types depend on the the architecture and
compiler.  However there are restrictions on how small or big a data
type can be.  For most situations, there is no need to know these
details, and it is advisable (if possible) to write code which does not
depend on these details.

If the file ends in .gz, you extract it using:

$gzip -d filename.gz

If it ends in .tar.gz, you extract it using:

$tar -xzvf filename.tar.gz

The sizes of various basic types depend on the the architecture and
compiler.  However there are restrictions on how small or big a data
type can be.  For most situations, there is no need to know these
details, and it is advisable (if possible) to write code which does not
depend on these details.

It is also advisable to know that size of a byte is not necessarily 8 bits.

<wiki>
Byte:

A contiguous sequence of a *fixed* number of bits. On modern
computers, an eight-bit byte or octet is by far the most common.
Certain older models have used six-, seven-, or nine-bit bytes -- for
instance on the 36-bit architecture of the PDP-10. Another example of
a non eight-bit sequence is the 12-bit slab of the NCR-315. A byte is
always atomic on the system, meaning that it is the smallest
addressable unit. An eight-bit byte can hold 256 possible values (28 =
256) -- enough to store an unsigned integer ranging from 0 to 255, a
signed integer from -128 to 127, or a character of a seven-bit (such
as ASCII) or eight-bit character encoding.

Sridhar, You are correct. The search for the actual post "How To Untar 
.gz files" in google resulted in

http://www.google.co.in/search?q=How+To+Untar+.gz+files&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&meta=

The very first link has the answer.

Dear Linux enthusiasts,
LINUX For You's August issue is now hitting newsstands all across India. Be 
it career prospects in Linux/OSS arena or Miguel De Icaza's interview--each 
feature carries an element of interest for the Linux community. We share the 
main highlights of the August issues--see if you can afford to miss this 
one. 
*******Highlights*******
LFY CD#1
--------
SME Linux--a complete Linux server that can be installed from a single CD
LFY CD #2
---------
* OpenMosix--Set up your own cluster
* Zope's latest version (an award winning content management system) 
* Amigo Linux--Linux that runs on Windows
LINUX For You
-------------
* Career Prospects in the Linux/OSS arena
* Installing Winmodems
* Running Linux on a laptop
* Annual market survey of Linux in the Indian Industry
* Linux desktops--Branded yet a Bargain
LFY PRO
-------
* Miguel De Icaza's exclusive interview
* Make Your Monitor a Radio Station
* Java Programming on Linux
* Programming with PHP and MySQL
* ClusterKnoppix reviewed
*******Highlights*******
Why do we have two versions of Linux For You now?
-------------------------------------------------
Linux For You was conceived with the aim of pushing Linux from labs to 
offices. To achieve this goal, we realised that we needed to reduce the 
pricing of the main magazine so that those who were not technical but 
curious about Linux/OSS could access the information. Hence, LINUX For You's 
main magazine was created as a magazine for everyone to read.
At the same time, the demand from the tech community was clear -- they 
needed technical content along with CDs that bundled the latest software and 
distros. Hence, the combined pack of LINUX For You and LFY PRO and the two 
CDs is now available at Rs 100!
For more details about LINUX For You magazine, log on to www.linuxforu.com 
or email at niraj@efyindia.com.
This communication aims to inform the Linux community about the information 
contained in Asia's only magazine on Linux and open source, and we hope that 
it will be taken positively.

Did you try booting to maintanence mode and running fsck.  Running
fsck on a read-write partition might damage it further.  Its not
advisable.  So boot to single user mode, try running fsck -y / after
remounting the root partition to read-only.

Having said this, did you search groups.google.com before posting this?

Message-ID: <ceth44+nddo@eGroups.com>

Hi all,

This was the exact error message when I used RHL9.0 with Mozilla 1.2.1

Just follow the steps as given below to solve this issue ...

1.Download the Java Runtime Environment from the following link

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html

Note:
U can choose either ***rpm.bin or ***.bin
MAKE SURE THE DESTINATION PATH IS /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
(I choose the self extracting one which I found to be easier)

2.Give execute permission to the downloaded file (which should be 
j2re-1_4_2_05-linux-i586.bin )

3.Execute the file as ./j2re-1_4_2_05-linux-i586.bin

4.Make sure that u have the appropriate directory "j2re1.4.2_05"

5.Finally create a symlink as shown below...

lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           53 Jul  3 00:20 
libjavaplugin_oji.so -
> ./j2re1.4.2_05/plugin/i386/ns610/libjavaplugin_oji.so

6.Alternatively can also try to copy the file "libjavaplugin_oji.so" 
to the "plugins" directory directly ... but it did not work as 
expected

TO CHECK IF ITS INSTALLED PROPERLY

Open MOZILLA BROWSER ---> Help ---> About Plug-ins

The output should be as follows...

Installed plug-ins

Java(TM) Plug-in 1.4.2_05-b04

    File name: libjavaplugin_oji.so
    Java(TM) Plug-in 1.4.2_05

hmm...  I am not sure _IF_ that is the real Joseph B. Ottinger or the

To what extent does the Linux kernel rely upon BIOS?

Thanks,
Ramanraj.

Not to ruin your joy over a working hw setup, but in fact pretty much
all decent PC OSs these days (the list is long, but does *not* include
any version of DOS, for example) can do what FreeBSD did in this case
just fine. The BIOS is no longer used by the OS to access the disk, but
the BIOS needs to recognize the drive at least in part in order to be
able to boot the OS from it (obviously). So, the lesson to take home
here is this: unless you want to boot from a disk, you pretty much do
not have to worry about the BIOS these days using eg FreeBSD. This does
not include broken BIOS implementations, that actually crash and refuse
to boot with an overly large drive even if the type is set to NONE. (I
have seen such thing unfortunately) Luckily, there is almost always a
last BIOS update even for older boards from sometime around 1999 because
of the Y2K madness, and these usually include support for larger drives
as well.

  The kernel itself has very minimal dependancies on the BIOS. As of
2.4, only APM, ACPI and ISAPnP had any dependancy on ROM and/or ROM
extensions on the system board. A number of drivers including net,
scsi, RAID, etc. may have dependancies on ROM extensions on adapter
cards, but these are optional and can be config'ed out.

  The only critical component that needs the BIOS, and only to boot
the kernel, is LILO or any other boot manager. Of course, this
isn't part of the kernel.

  Check out the LinuxBIOS and ROMDOS projects for different approaches
to get around BIOS limitations. There are many trends in progress:

1) A minimal BIOS that only loads and starts something else (Open
Firmware, etc.).

2) A maximal BIOS that includes an OS in it, so it can correctly
recognize and configure a wide range of devices (LinuxBIOS, EFI, ...).

3) A (traditional closed-source) Award/AMI-like BIOS that is customized
for each board by modularization, allowing some degree of upgradability.
For instance, it is possible to upgrade an Award BIOS for i440LX/BX PII slot-1
boards to support later slot-1 or socket-370 Intel CPUs, including
all Celerons, PIIs and PIIIs up to the last Coppermine-core CPU.
(I'm inclined to stick with this tried-and-tested approach.)

Message-ID: <OFDB6F92DC.4DF614E8-ON65256EE8.001B676C@lntinfotech.com>


Hi all,
      I seem to have a little problem with shell scripting. I need all your
valuable help.

      Following is a part of a shell script i wrote

                  IGSPATH=/opt/JP1Cm2IGS
                  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/JP1Cm2IGS/bin
                  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

      I need the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set after
execution of this script .I can put this under /etc/bashrc or under the
.bash_profile file ,so that it is set in all terminals . But my requirement
is that the environment variable should be set only after the execution of
the shell script.

      After i execute the shell sript as

            [root@localhost /]   ./shell_script

      I also kow , i can set the variable in the shell where i run this
shell script by executing it as (. ./ by putting a "." in front of the "./"
to ask the shell to execute the script in the current shell rather than
spawning a new shell. But this seems to close my parent shell, so this
opting too iam discounting) i checked the value of this environment
variable using

            [root@localhost /] echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

      It shows nothing, i mean the variable is not being set.I understand
the function of EXPORT command is to make sure the variable that is being
set, to be reflected in all the terminals after the execution of this
EXPORT command.

      Is this a bug with the EXPORT command or am i not understanding the
function of this command . I request you all to please help me solve this.

Thanks a ton in advance

Hi sridhar,

            I tried your suggestion , but the shell is getting closed after
executing the script.(That was quite valuble  i came to know of this
command "source") . But my shell script executes another executable

                  /home/harris/bin/igschk &
Could this be the culprit . Why should it close the shell . Is it because
iam putting the process in the background ?? .. Kindly help

If you run a shell script as ./shell_script, this is executed with a new 
shell. So, what ever you export is for the child shell and it is not 
visible in your parent shell (when child terminates it is gone).

To make this to influence your parent shell, you have to do either 
'source shell_script' or '. shell_script'

HTH.

Thanks ppl , I think a shell script with an EXPORT command in it will not
propogate the value being exported to its parent shell . For that i need to
run it by placing a "." (Praveen)  b4 the script name or by using "source"
command (sridhar). Thanks a ton 4 the help .

Hi,

Solution for Query No.2

If ur OS is RHL 9.0 & u use GNOME by default ---> open
a terminal window & type the following

gdmflexiserver &

wait for few seconds...then press Ctl+Alt+F8..ur done
with it

If that does not work dont worry press Ctl+Alt+F1 few
times & it will automatically take u to the next
Xsession i.e. Ctl+Alt+F8

So u can go upto Ctl+Alt+F12 by typing
'gdmflexiserver' that many times from ur original
Xsession that is Ctl+Alt+F7

If u have a different linux flavour ---> open a
terminal & just type startx -- :1 => Ctl+Alt+F8
startx -- :2 => Ctl+Alt+F9 & so on...by default 0 is
the main Xsession i.e. Ctl+Alt+F7

I believe I would be able to solve ur Query No.5 also
if u give me more details or error message

Hi,

    I am trying to make my Win2k machine dual boot with RH9. My installation is 
working fine. But I am not able to proceed as the system always boots with 
Windows directly without starting LILO.

    During installation, I got a message saying that /boot could not be 
configured and I need to create a boot disk. Does this mean that I cannot do 
ordinary boot at all?

    Please advise.

Rgds,
Karthick S.

Hi,

Consider changing the threshold parameter, required_hits in the
spamassassin configuration file. Increasing this threshold will increase
the amount of spam missed and it will reduce the risk of false
positives.

Refer the following link for further details:

Go to /etc/rc.d
Here you would find the scripts that are run at startup and shutdown
Under this there are dirs like rc1.d, rc2.d ... these dirs contain the
scripts to be run for the particular run level. The scripts starting
with S are run at start up and K scripts are run at shutdown (or is it
vice versa ?).  Go to rc5.d if you are running at level 5. Here grep for
the message that you see at the console (to identify the script). In
these scripts interactive shell commands work, so you can add your small
password protection facility here.

Usually this happens when your root partition is not identified.
But there can be thousands of other reasons too. A dmesg output right
after a boot might help in analyzing the issue.

Are you sure you boot directory contains 'only' kernel.h ?
Or do you mean to say that it's the only header file there ?
Don't you see any vmlinuz*, Sytem.map*,grub dir etc ? 

> the boot up it showed that it was not able to mount

The 2.6.x kernel does not support ext3 by default. It would be either
modularized or not there at all. You would have to recompile to kernel
to build ext3 as a part of it. 

Do make menuconfig in the kernel sources dir

Go to 
File systems  ---> <*> Ext3 journalling file system support

If it already shows a M (<M> instead of <*>) as above, then you might
have
Forgotten to a make modules and make modules_install.
If you are following the modules method then creating a ram disk image
would help. 

Goto your /boot, and run mkinitrd ./initrd-2.6.6.img 2.6.6
This would make the rd image.

Next you would have to add a corresponding entry in /etc/grub.conf
initrd /vmlinuz-2.6.6.img

I would recommend recompiling with ext3 support inbuilt.

Gopu Bhaskar.

Use a LiveCD distro like Knoppix to boot into your
system. You can then change your /etc/inittab file,

Regarding security ....

Windows is definitely trashable in my home at-least.  Even in Windows
XP (tested in 2000), a guest user can easily delete a *certain*
registry key, which totally makes the system unstable(nothing can be
clicked)--after rebooting the login dialog will not be visible--this
makes the system totally *unusable*.  What do you say on this? (This
is tried out experiment in XXX)

Regarding Visual Studio ..

I do totally agree with him.  An IDE will be definitely useful.  But
so far I'm happy with gvim/anjuta for my development. (google for
scaffold).

Regarding IIS, Asp.net

VB developers dislike PHP, I know. period

Regarding community support ...

MS employees are being paid for that .. and that's their job (Online
Support Enggineers?).  In Linux side people are perhaps busy
supporting non-noob problems.  Probably he hears 'RTFM' as 'Stay
away'.

  He means to say that HPUX(distro) is more secure than Linux
(distro), and HPUX itself was compromised; ergo,
Linux(distro), with its implied weaker security must also
be penetratable.

  IMHO, the obvious blunder in all these assumptions is
that it confuses the kernel with kernel+userland, as usual.
It does not take into account the way the OS (kernel
+userland) is built and configured. In particular, it's
easy to build a custom kernel with carefully chosen
Netfilter options and to configure IPTables to make practically
*any* Linux installation very secure, which is not an
option on the proprietary Unices. In HPUX or Solaris, you're
stuck with what came on the CD.

  The mistake is to assume that the default install
of the common distros is the most secure.

  IMHO, Linux(kernel+userland) overtook the commercial Unices
in security in about 1998/99 timeframe. The market is only
figuring it out slowly, hence the time lag when you still have
opinions expressed like the claim that HPUX is more secure
than Linux.

Not only the market, but many governments have also not yet realised the 
security [and utility] made possible and available with the Linux kernel 
+ userland, as Siva has very rightly and accurately stated.  Governments 
and the public lose very heavily when this truth is missed and not acted 
upon.  A case in point in the Libra Project of the British Government, 
to computerise their Criminal Courts, that failed inspite of having 
taken in as much as 300+ million sterling pounds, , and now new 
contractors are now incharge of the project, armed with GNU/Linux. 
 Governments have a public duty and responsibility not to waste scarce 
and precious public resources experimenting with non-free software 
ignoring the availability of highly secure and robust free Linux kernel 
+ userland.  Eternal vigilance is required in democracies, and I really 
wish that people in the know are able to participate in the procurement 
process, and earn the millions in a befitting way, delivering to the 
people what they really deserve to have in return for the tax money paid 
as consideration.

Dear Luggers,

    I have two requests to make to you. Or, you can take it as advice.

1. Don't hate M$.
     - They may be evil, but also smart. Talking about Microsoft or 
other competitors to linux cannot be counted as "nonsense" because when 
your competitor has a good point, you have to acknowledge it. You ignore 
their good points at your own peril.

     - I know it for a fact that VS.NET kicks ass. That, inspite of my 
being a Emacs fan. Go figure.

2. Don't hate the dissenters.
    - For any community, dissenters are important. They are the first 
people who can see the good points in others even if they love what they 
belong to. They're the smarter people, whether you accept it or not. 
And, you can count on them to give sound advice when you need it. Stop 
the witch-hunting. You'll lose smart people.

Your well-wisher,
Vamsee Kanakala.

Dear ILUGCers,

Open-Source (in all its software, frameworks, standards, conversation,
content, intelligence, strategy, currency) forms has the biggest role in
this.

Painlessly Resourcing Tamil/Indian Renaissances -- Tamildom Example
Bill Gates & Tamil Society
By Bala Pillai, Sydney, Australia

"Bill Gates, on his path to billions, has done more for English society than
any Tamil has for Tamil society, this century"

Ever wondered what impact Bill Gates has on Tamil society? Very little?
Think again.

Why are most emails between Tamils today in English?

How many Tamils who know the Tamil language, email each other in English?
Why?

How many Tamils would not have come to the US if not for the PC revolution
and its flow on industries?

How many Tamils study English, instead of Tamil, furiously in India, so that
they can come to the US?

Why has there been an astronomical rise in English matriculation schools in
Tamilnadu?

What do most of the mushrooming commercial IT colleges in Tamilnadu teach?
What qualifications do they prepare students for?

Of the new jobs created in the last decade in Tamilnadu, how many of them
are in the software, body-shopping and telecommunications industries?

What role would the rise of above job scenario played in reinforcing the
"Thamil Soaru Poadaathu" mindset? And fueled even more to go into the
English schools?

What would these have done to the amount of English words in Tamil in
Tamilnadu? What would we expect someone who studied in English, mostly works
in English, spends most of his day dabbling in English to do when she speaks
Tamil?
What would this have done to Tamils comprehension of difficult Tamil words?

How would this scenario placed Tamils in, when choosing between an English
word or a not commonly used new Tamil word for a new notion?

Television stations compete with each other for ratings. These ratings
determine their survival. Since survival is the highest priority for most
endeavours including ourselves, how would this impact the amount of English
in television? What pressures would the ubiquity of English in day-to-day
life put on the content of television and other media? What real
alternatives do these media have? Are they to give up and wane away? Or do
they have to yield to the forces of words in the air and minds and
accommodate them, to remain alive?

Can we safely say that the one person most responsible for all of above,
whether he intended to or not is Bill Gates?

Has any Tamil in the last century, done anything strategic with anywhere as
much flow-on effects, for the Tamil language, as Bill Gates has for the
English language?

Can we also say that we made Bill Gates job easier by not creating enough
new jobs?

Why did we not create enough new jobs? How did we create jobs when there was
no English for hundreds of years between the invention of the thosai,
valaiyal, naadagam and hundreds of other Tamil icons and the entry of
English into India?

OK, so what do we do now? Can a language survive for long, if it moves out
of day-to-day sphere into "we must relish our heritage" sphere? What would
have happened if this had happened 200 years ago? Would our parents speak
Tamil? Or would we be more like Tamils in British Guyana/Trinidad?

Can we reverse it? Archimedes says, "Give me long enough of a lever and I
will single-handedly lift the Earth"

Yes we can, if we are not blind to leap-frogging levers that show up. No, we
can't if we are steeped in denial or if we give up the race before the
starting line. The choice of how resolute we want to be, is ours.

Yes, we can if 5 Tamils joined together and did 5% of a what a Tamil Bill
Gates would do given today's wired world possibilities.

If we had one million Tamils wired together in full-on connectednessful mode
interacting, building trust and trading our services with each other in
Tamil and English, what cannot we do, is the more appropriate question.

Just as ants do in an ant colony, what if we had wired Erumbugal Tamil minds
in a globally interconnected minds colony?

Let us say we together organised a Tamildom cooperative. And Tamildom put
for free, US$2000 worth of Tamil dollars (or points, like frequent flyer
points), into the account of each of these million Tamils on two conditions:

(a) each must use the dollars to buy services or products from any of the
other million Tamils within a year and

(b) each must provide 2000 Tamil dollars worth of his services or products,
at his list price, to the the other Tamils.

Let's say the cooperative is funded by a 10% trading fee from each
transaction, similar to how credit card operations are run.

Let's say we extend it to those who are not wired by providing jobs to human
bridges who bridge the wired with the not-so-wired.

And let us say we issue Tamildom cards to enable purchases to be made via
phones and face-to-face as well as through the Internet.

How much capital do we raise in the process to spur Tamil economy. What is 1
million X 2,000. That is $2 billion. Add to this the education value of
getting all these Tamils to be self incentived to by themselves trade and
pay over the Internet, which would be another $2 billion. That is $4 billion
of capital mobilised, without a cent out of the pocket.

Remember one man's income is another's expense. By catalysing Tamil
spending, we increase Tamil income.

And what if we seeded a list of Tamildom development projects eg Tamil
cooperative bank, a Tamildom Everyware "Tamil/English Pcware for dummies",
Tamil voice recognition, Tamil mindset unlearning, Tamil interactive voice
response, Tamil legal insurance, a Siddha medicine brand for Americans,
Tamil accounting and financial analysis with part of this capital? What if
we brought together a portion of  the vast majority of Tamils who cannot
express
themselves well in English to add to Tamildom's vibrance quickly?

  No, Bill Gates isn't responsible for the dominance of English - it was
already the dominant language before he was born. It became dominant because
of the longstanding mercantile and maritime tradition of England. You may
want to read some history first. A good start would be "History of the
English Speaking People" in 5 volumes by Winston Churchill. It covers the
period between 55 BC and today. Oh, I forgot, it's written in English.

  If I had to name one person in the last 2000 years who was responsible for
the dominance of English today, it would have to be somebody who wasn't
English and never spoke a word of English: Queen Isabella of Portugal,
patroness of Christopher Columbus. The good queen was very learned, spoke
many languages fluently (but not English), took many steps to provide
equality in rights to all her subjects (irrespective of sex, race or
birth), was frugal to the point of mending her husband, the King's, clothes
herself - repairing one pair of pants no less than seven times, rather
than discarding it. Nevertheless, when presented with an unknown sailor
from Genoa who requested three ships to be fitted and provisioned for
a voyage to discover a continent that very few actually believed to exist,
the good Queen lost no time in showering her generosity on him.

  I think there's a lot more to be learned from Isabella's deeds than
from Billy boy at Redmond. Coita Gatego, as I always say: Bill Gates
must be screwed.

Has he?

English is a language that took root in india much before computers did.

And it has served as a useful link language in a country where all you 
have to do is to fly about an hour or two on an airplane to land in a 
city where nobody speaks your language at all.

Tamil chauvinism and other misguided ideas about the glory of tamil 
culture as opposed to the culture of some other language / ethnic group 
is certainly not something to waste time on, whereas bringing the 
benefit of computers to people who aren't sufficiently able to harness 
their power just because they dont speak / know english too well (or not 
at all) is a worthy goal.

>>Can we safely say that the one person most responsible for all of above,

I can safely say that this is rubbish

Revaival of interest in Tamil, at this juncture would pay rich dividend:
First, Tamil itself could find an internet niche where it could maintain
continuity with the past and grow into the future; Secondly, others
would get a chance to learn much from Tamil literature and culture.

Recently, a friend reminded me of the poem:

Varappuyara Neer Uyarum;
Neer Uyara Nel Uyarum;
Nel Uyara Kudi Uyarum;
Kudi Uyara Kon Uyarvaan.

Roughly, it could be translated as:

Raising ridges raise water;
Raising water raise crops;
Raising crops raise the subjects;
Raising subjects raise the king.

Tamil literature is full of stunning depth, truth and wisdom.  Where
else is there an equal for Avvayar's Athichoodi - the Tamil Needhi Nool?
  Which other culture could teach high ethical principles with such
simplicity to its children? The Tamil Treasures need to be made
available urgently to everyone.

Tamil is the oldest spoken language which has yet managed to maintain
its youth and vigour.  Computing languages need to learn much from the
way Tamil has evolved with strong and simple root words: kal, man, vaan,
etc. which appear to have been retained unchanged over several thousand
years.   I am not sure how many would agree for a freeze of a particular
standard- say ANSI C, so that code written today may be intelligible a
hundred or even a thousand years later [please imagine its use in
manned/unmanned space missions of the near future]. The last scholar who
took great pride and interest in the study of ancient Tamil History and
Culture was probably P.T. Srinivasa Iyengar.  He revealed in his books
that there are several villages deep inside Tamil Nadu, where time has
stood still over several millenia. The discipline in Tamil grammar deals
not only with the language but also binds the culture and life of its
people.

I agree with Siva and SRS on everything else :)

Kindly post in a line or two, what you expect from volunteers to
contribute towards the project.

See where your user profile is stored ... maybe in a subdirectory under 
mozilla, under your user profile.

In win2k / xp etc it'd be in your Application Data folder.

Unfortunately, no.  But you can always use the download with extension
thats available from:

What we need right now to augment the team, are LAMP systems administrators
to maintain, install, integrate, trouble-shoot and Tamilise one or more of
Open Source applications like mailing list, web forum, online search, online
collaboration, social networks, directory, project management, blog and CRM
applications in the Tamil.Net server that has been running since 1995. With
a view to becoming a partner in this social entrepreneurship venture
in-the-making.

To accelerate the effort, we are sharing and exchanging expertise and effort
with other connectednessful mother-tongue groups. See
http://www.ryze.com/go/bala for the outline of generic self-sustaining
convergent social/knowledge networks.

The `mbox' files are those without any extension.  The `.msf' is `Mail
Summary Format' file, which is being used as an index for faster
accessing of the mbox files.  Your mail client will automatically
create these `.msf' files if you don't have them.

If you're looking for some nice scripts to get started with, you can 
check this out:

It's the site of the book "Wicked Cool Shell Scripts" by Dave Taylor, 
but it has all the scripts explained in the book online. Pretty

It's working for me... did you restart the browser? SessionSaver starts 
working *after* you restarted it once. That is, it saves all the tabs 
after the browser restart. No need to configure/activate anything.

Yes I did restart. But closing the browser brings up the "Confirm Close" 
message box. I don't have admin rights to this system. Does this matter? 
Although no problem is reported in install.log; is there anyway we can cross 
verify?

> I think it's not going to be of any use with latest sify broadband offers.

Moreover they have a non-refundable deposit of around 3000Rs. I think this 'non-
refundable' deposit things is one of the most evilish of the armours that many 
chennai companies (in particular; as far as i have seen) resort to as a shield 
for their poor service; to lock down the user with his money.

And found one unadvertised-as-yet scheme of touchtel while talking to one of 
their customer care reps. Its an unlimited bandwidth @ 64kbps for about 
1000Rs/month.Though the speed is low, i think overall it would be a good value 
package. (yet to tryout.)

James Roshan as far as I know (as a person whom I attended the training with 
for the current company that I am working in) is a geek who is kind of wasting 
his time in MS technologies. He is listed under MVP-India (MS Valued 
Professional). A few weeks ago he joined MS-IDC. 

I was going through his blog and was surprised to see his picture with Miguel 
De Icaza (Ximian). Here is what he has to say... in his e-mail to the MVP 
mailing list.

http://pensieve.thinkingms.com/CommentView.aspx?guid=4eb0d476-b83d-49a2-9933-

This, in my opinion, is one of the best write-ups I have ever read, for the 
obvious fact. May it is n't so obvious until you have seen the kind of devotion 
he puts himself into MS technologies.

Wait a sec... are you talking about Mozilla Suite or Mozilla Firefox? 
Sorry, I think I assumed it as firefox as soon as I saw about tabs and 
session saving. I don't know whether these extensions work for Mozilla 
Suite. For Firefox, they do.

If you do have firefox, then when you download an extension(like 
SessionSaver), it will ask whether to install it for all users or just 
for yourself. You should select the option to install the extension just 
for yourself, if you don't have admin rights. This will save the 
extension in .phoenix directory in your home directory. It will ask 
"Close all tabs?" while exiting. Click yes. Better yet, deselect the 
checkbox that reminds this everytime you close the browser. The rest of 
it, session saver will take care.

Hi guys,

I work in a software company and am looking for someone with the following skillsets:

Installation, configuration, maintenance, admin of
1.Linux systems
2.Windows 2000/2003 
3.TCP/IP networks
4.Samba
5.Web Server
6.Mail Server
7.MySQL, PgSQL
8.Firewalls
..... etc, etc

Pls dont flame me for asking for windoze sysadmins in this list but I guess its easier to find Linux sysads who know windoze than the other way round!

Position requires 2-3 years of sys admin exp. Should be capable of taking complete charge of all sys admin tasks, have the drive to conceptualize and implement solutions independently.

We also want 2 resources who are good at databases (admin and SQL programming), scripting (shell/perl), client interfacing experience...


Those interested pls mail me at k_manokaran@rediffmail.com .

Thanks & regards,
mano

Alternatively, if you already have  the woody netinst ISO, you can use
it   and  then   after  your   base   is  installed,   you  can   edit
/etc/apt/sources.list to  use 'testing'  (or 'sarge' depending  on how
you want your system to bleed) and do a dist-upgrade.

...   and it will  take sometime  to "arrive"  at the  apt-get update;
apt-get upgrade frequency that  matches your enthusiasm level and your
bandwidth availability. :)

cheers,

Hello 

I do believe the scheme has some sort of string attached
to it. If i am right the unlimited bandwidth scheme is 
applicable only for X pm to X am. I would be happy if 
someone has correct info on this.

Thanks,

  Check whether it is open relay? If yes, close it and use access if you 
  don't have roaming users. SMTP Auth is other way to do this.

Message-ID: <20040810093222.20477.qmail@web53504.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi All,
       we are running rx4640 Itanium servers(5), 
with Redhat Advanced Server 2.1 Update-4 version, 
in that 3 machines hang 2 times in last 4 months,
other 2 machines are running with out any issues.
All machines are same H/W and S/W configurations.

 How to find out whether it's H/W or S/W related 
issues, I couldn't found any clue from system log
file(messages), is there any other place to check??
or do I need to install any other utility? so that
I can get some log next time. 

thanks in advance,

  What do you think the amount date (in MB) downloaded by dist-upgrade
will be if I had to install gnome, xfce, gimp, emacs, firefox,
thunderbird, ... (I need to calculate before hand as I am on dialup)

 Again, how much will apt-get update take? (assuming an update per
week frequency)

The total size should be less  than 4MB for sarge per update. The only
thing that keeps  changing is usually 'main'... which  means you would
only require around 2MB per week (therefore, about 4MB x 4weeks + ~8MB
per   month  on  an   average.)   Upgrading   is  a   different  thing
altogether. Nowadays, I upgrade only about once in two weeks and I end
up downloading about 250MB per upgrade.

Looks like this option has to be dropped out.  Anyway I found this
http://gluck.debian.org/cdimage/testing/

Really confused--which one to download, but I doesn't bother as anyway
I am not willing to download that 2 GB over my dialup line. :(

That's pretty good. :)

 I can't believe this.  In gentoo this (sources) can't exceed 50 MB
(except in rare cases where update for OO.org is available, for eg.)

Ok, so I have prepared myself to download these ISOs
http://cdimage.debian.org/pub/weekly/torrents/i386/

I hope the first 3 would contain gnome, openoffice, gaim and all other
important packages.

Does these ISOs contain the new debian sarge installer?

BTW, is apt implemented in C (not any scripting languages)?

May be the `first time dist-upgrade` could take up that much.  But do
you think the same amount of data would be downloaded the next week
(how much will it be then)?

The scheme you are talking about is
1. 128 kbps; hour based
2. includes your phone rental and 200Rs worth of talk time.

where as this scheme is
1. 64 kbps; unlimited *download*;always on scheme
2. does not include any phone things. its costs about 800Rs/month for
dsl alone. you have to deal with your phone separately.

If you are looking for a device driver development kit, 
you can use Jungo windriver, but its costly and not a open source tool.

There is no standard DDK for pci driver development, 
Linux Device drivers by Alessandro?s rubini is a good starting point.

No!  Debian  packages   go  into  said  ISO  images   based  on  their

I think so.  But My recommendation  would be for the sarge netinst ISO
and  installing everything  from the  net.  I'm  sure you  wouldn't be
installing everything thats  on the CDs. But yeah, its  a pain if your
ISP keeps disconnecting you every now and then.

Not entirely. Some of the  core programs like dpkg, apt-get, dpkg-deb,
etc.,. are  compiled binaries.  But there are  lots of shell  and perl
programs as well.

I'm only talking about incremental  upgrades (ie.,. upgrades that I do
once or twice a month). Everytime I upgrade it tells me that there are
around 200+ packages to upgrade.  It depends on your installation.

Well, this is where gentoo stacks up good.  In gentoo you have the
concept of 'system' and 'world'.  'system' means only core packages. 
'world' means packages in world file.  Whenever you emerge (install) a
package that package is added to the world file, but *NOT* the
dependencies.  Updating a gentoo box is simply running the command
'emerge world' that will *only* update the packages specified in world
file (which is equivalent to saying upgrading packages of interest to
user and 'system').  In contrast debian will upgrade the
user-specified (in world file, for gentoo) packages along with all
other packages installed as dependencies (which in gentoo, doesn't as
they are not listed in world file).

I hope this the reason for the great difference in upgrade size b/w
debian and gentoo.

Any successful dialup user keeping his(/her?) debian box updated?

So will the download size be reduced If I planned to upgrade thrice a year?

i.e is 3*X(4) < 24*X(1/2) ?

Are  you saying  that  if package  foo depends on  bar, but user wants

that bar already exists, but new version of foo requires a new version
of bar. Will it continue to update only foo?

Definitely. After  an year, package-0.1 will be  package-2.1. When you
do once in  a month you will end up  downloading everything in between
package-0.1 and package-2.1

 It will also install bar.  Suppose if the new version of foo is
satisfied with existing version of bar, though a new version of bar
exists, gentoo (unless bar is world file) won't updade bar.  But
debian, in this case will update both.

What do you think the download size will be If I dist-upgrade daily? 
And I think that should reduce it further and this method will be
quite appropriate for me.

(Note: I can shedule that in night allowing maximum download of 100 MB)

If  you  can  achieve 100MB  over  a  night  (and  be able  to  handle
disconnections, etc.,.)  then yes, daily upgrades should do. Infact my
guess is that  a dist-upgrade once in every three  days would fit into
100MB.

No! Debian wont. In this case,  Lets say foo depends on bar >=2.0. And
what you have on your box is bar-2.0. Debian wont upgrade bar. It will
download only foo.  _but_ if foo  depends on some version which is not
on  your box,  debian will  download it.   I dont  see  any difference
between gentoo and debian as such. Our discussion was about why debian
sucks when it comes to network usage. and I dont think debian sucks :)
(thats probably a biased view, though ;) )

If you're new to kernel-side programming, just forget about PCI
or USB driver development. Start with something basic, like a serial
driver for a 16450/16550 UART, learn the basics, then move to PCI.
USB is for stalwarts only - no two devices implement the spec the
same way, or correctly, for that matter.

OTOH, if you're new to Linux userland programming, forget about
kernel-side programming altogether. Learn about gcc, make,
etc. on the userland-side before moving to the kernel-side.

Anyway, I'll second the recommendation of Rubini's book on driver
development.

  There isn't any DDK in Linux - this isn't the Micros~1 world. The
entire Linux kernel source, GNU libc source and the GNU tools together
constitute the equivalent of the DDK. You have to understand the
interplay of the kernel with the userland, including the POSIX spec
clearly, before you can start writing drivers.

Hi,
I saw one of the query posted by you in some other mailing list.
From that I could understand that you dont have any idea about
what is a kernel space/user space, and how to compile and link
an application properly in an embedded linux enviroment.

It is wise to get to know about the developement enviroment, 
browse the Linux source tree, and write some small drivers, before start
writing a pci or USB driver.

If you want to write a pci driver, have a look at the drivers
available in linux/drivers/net , there you will find lot of drivers which uses the
pci functions.

basically a pci based driver does the following
    1. queries whether the particular device available in the pci bus, by passing
        vendor id and device id
    2. if the device found, remap the pci resources (IO, Memory)
    3. query the IRQ line and assign the Interrupt handler
    4. do whatever you want to do with your hardware

There wont be any easy methods to learn linux kernel programming, 
dont expect somebody will come and train you, learn by yourself.
If you have some particular queries , post it here, somebody might help you.

regards
durai

Use the 'file' utility. 

$ file file.sno

will tell you  what file it is,  if it was able to  detect. Works with
most standard  formats. But if this  is a custom file  format (like an
application serial number  data file), I dont think  file will be able
to help.

Ah! Suppose if I do ..

apt-get dist-upgrade

what packages will debian upgrade to the latest versions? (all?)

Note: In gentoo only packages listed in 'world' file will be upgraded.

My gcc is 

gcc (GCC) 3.3.3 20040412 (Red Hat Linux 3.3.3-7)

And it does give an error on compile about modifying a read-only variable. 
Maybe a bug that was fixed?

It runs cleanly.

Okay, the doubt is now cleared. From K&R ...

The result is implementation-defined if an attempt is made to change a const.

That makes sense for gcc to fire warning instead of error (a=20).

Yes. In gcc 3.3.4 (here) it's giving error, though the standard left
it as 'undefined'.  Doesn't really matter.

This is not a bug in gcc ... Surely this is with

Kernighan Ritchi Book There they Have specified about

that makes me wonder, how can such a specification be left implementation
dependent. that evidently takes away the very purpose of const keyword. 
shouldn't this be enforced rather than leaving it to the compiler writer 
to decide ?

Quoting from the ANSI C standard(8.2), "The purpose of const is to announce objects that may be placed in read-only memory, and perhaps to increase opportunities for optimization. ... Except that it should diagnose explicit attempts to change const objects, a compiler may ignore these qualifiers."

BTW, if you compile the program with -O optimization flag, the value of `a' will not change to 20.

In the contrib part of the source tree of kannel you should find a web
based interface too.
You would either need a GSM modem or a SMPP/UCP connection to a Mobile
operator which appears to available with several of them now for kannel
to work for you.

Message-ID: <001601c48087$d3ebc200$68a841db@j4e4a9>

Hi All

I run a dual boot m/c(win98/ RH9) with i815 e motherboard (Mercury brand)
which has integrated sound and video. I recently installed Slackware 10.0 on
another partition. I am unable to get sound in Slack. It works fine in RH9
though which recognises i815 e AC 97 sound.

In Slack , when I run KDE, error message pops up saying unable to initialise
/dev/dsp , so it will run using null output. Previously when I installed
Slack9 also this problem was there and was configured using alsamixer
command and was stored using alsactl_restore command. When I issue alsamixer
command , it says device not found. Upon listing, i found /dev/dsp symbolic
link to /dev/dsp0.

What is to be done to get sound configured in Slack 10? What has changed?
Pl help

run alsaconf first - it will insert entries like this into 
/etc/modules.conf for intel8x0 sound chipsets.

No, it is not possible. You can't install the gnome *package* without
installing the rhythmbox *package*. But there is a workaround if you
really want to. gnome is basically a meta-package, it does not provide
any file of its own. It just lists a set of dependencies which get
installed when gnome gets installed.

$ apt-cache depends gnome
gnome
  Depends: gnome-desktop-environment
  Depends: gnome-office
  Depends: bluefish
 |Depends: evolution
  Depends: balsa
  Depends: gnome-cups-manager
  Depends: gnome-themes-extras
  Depends: rhythmbox
 |Depends: synaptic
  Depends: gnome-apt
  Depends: xscreensaver
$

This shows the list of dependencies. Remove rhythmbox alone from the
list (call it REST for now)

# REST="gnome-desktop-environment \
gnome-office \
bluefish \
evolution \
balsa \
gnome-cups-manager \
gnome-themes-extras \
synaptic \
gnome-apt \
xscreensaver"

# apt-get install ${REST}

You might miss out on some configuration (if any) which gnome does in
its {pre,post}-{install,remove} scripts. In this case, gnome has no
scripts. 

HTH,
Suriya

Can I call this as a bug with the 'gnome' meta-package?  Why should I
care for epiphany when installing gnome alone.  I know gnome-desktop
is necessary for gnome, but I should be able to install epiphany
*only* if I want.

Even gentoo has [1] this problem

File a bug report if you feel so.

Not everyone can be satisfied. One might prefer the other way.  Such a
thing happens in several cases. kde depends on kghostview, etc.  which
one might not need. The linux kernel has a module which you might not
need, say vfat. Does it mean that it is a bug?

These meta-packages are offered as a convenience if you would like to
install gnome in a single command. This convenience (they feel and I
feel) is more important than saving disk space and bandwidth by
installing rhythmbox.

Don't use Debain/Gentoo/.... Build your own customized distro.

Generally in opensource Project More and More files
will be available in the "src" directory.

If I want to compile that directory after modifying
anything in any of the files I have make the whole
directory by giving 'make' command It will make the
whole file.

But I want a method so that It has to compile only the
modified and the executabel should use the
modification

Can any one tell me the method How I can acheive that
thank U .. :-)

  You don't compile the directory. What you usually do
is to compile the source code which is located in a tree
rooted in that directory.

  The process by which 'make' attempts to build the
source is controlled by a number of files. The one that
is most relevant to the source code that you're trying
to build will usually be in the same directory, and
called 'Makefile'.

  You can modify the Makefile if you want to.

  In most cases, the 'Makefile' will contain dependancies
to ensure that 'make' will do just that. It will only rebuild
those files that are dependent on changes you have made.
 
  If all the files, including the final executable depend
on a single source file, then of course, all the files
will be rebuilt. All this is under control of the 'Makefile'.

Subject: [Ilugc] Upgraded RedHat 7.3 to gcc-3.3.3
Message-ID: <20040813055251.C52421B3EE@whitebox.dias.ath.cx>


This must be old hat to Gentoo and Debian users, but I have
been able to progressively upgrade a stock RedHat 7.3 installation
to gcc-3.3.3, while retaining the glibc-2.2.5 library.

Why do this? 

1) Because I can.

2) Because RedHat 7.3 is rock stable, reliable and works great out of
the box; but I wanted to be able to take advantage of the libstdc++3
ABI and compile recent source rpms without patching.

3) Because  if you upgrade from 7.3 to 9/FC1/FC2 using the standard upgrade
installation, you will end up with a system that is slower and less
reliable than what you already have with RedHat 7.3. I'd blame this on
a lot of things, including glibc-2.3, XFree86-4.3, etc.

The toolchain and key source rpms are:

autoconf-2.57-3
automake-1.7.8-1
libtool-1.4.3-6
binutils-2.15.90.0.3-5
gcc-3.3.3-1 (from trilithium.com; more below)
glibc-kernheaders-2.4-8.36
glibc-2.2.5-45 (patched version of RedHat glibc-2.2.5-44)
freetype-2.1.4-5
XFree86-4.2.1-24 (patched version of RedHat XFree86-4.2.1-13.73.23)

and many more. All the source rpms are stock RedHat SRPMs from RH7.3, 8.0,
9, AS2.1, EL3, FC1 or FC2, with the exception of glibc and Xfree86, which
have trivial patches; and gcc-3.3.3-1.

gcc-3.3.3-1: Use the one from trilithium.com instead of the RedHat SRPMs,
which are heavily patched and have unnecessary dependancies.

glibc-2.2.5-44: Will not compile cleanly with gcc-3.3.3, but the fixes
are entirely syntax related. Replace all instances of __thread with
__thrd, for instance. Patchset is available with me, I'll post it on
request.

XFree86-4.2.1-13.73.23: Again, will not compile cleanly with gcc-3.3.3. The
simplest fix is to remove ttmkfdir from XFree86 and build it as a separate
RPM; this only requires changes to the spec file, available with me.

The crucial step to be able to perform this upgrade cleanly is the bootstrap
step for gcc-3.3.3. For this, you will need the compat-gcc-2.96... source
rpm from RedHat 8, and precompiled gcc-3.3.3-1 and cpp-3.3.3-1 rpms from
trilithium.com. You may need to do 2 or 3 bootstrap builds of gcc-3.3.3-1
from the source rpm to get rid of dependancies on compat-libstdc++-2.96.

Once there, attempt to remove compat-libstdc++. You may find dozens of
RPM dependancies from legacy RedHat 7.3 packages. Use your judgement;
remove some and rebuild the others that you require from appropriate
source RPMs. For instance, I got rid of tetex and all its dependancies;
but rebuilt a lot of xml-related stuff from recent source rpms. XFree86
will need to be patched (as mentioned above) and bootstrapped twice
to get rid of a dependancy on compat-libstdc++-2.96.

Once you've got rid of compat-libstdc++, you're home free. Just keep
rebuilding SRPMs from recent RedHat releases as necessary - my own
favorite is RHEL3 or White Box Enterprise Linux. Update dependancies
as necessary.

The end-point is rock-stable RedHat installation that has all the
performance advantages of gcc-3.x, combined with the reliability of
glibc-2.2.5. To date, there isn't a single issue with the setup.
Since RHEL3 is assured of support until 2008, there will be stable
SRPMs available for this setup at least until then.

Hi,

I had a fedora core1 with / , /tftpboot, /home partitions. 
I deleted /tftpboot using fdisk and trying to install win98 on that
partition. But unfortunately, the windows deleted all the parttions on the
HDD. Any idea to recover the data from that HDD??

FYI : no partitions/partition table shown on the HDD when i connect the
      HDD as secondary with another Linux PC.

How can Windows delete the partitions without you giving the commands?
I see two cases - fdisk malfunctioned OR you were ignorent enough on
how to use fdisk.

A distant possibility if you damaged your partition table. 

btw, i had a similar problem and i had to recover a text file. i used
'dd'. 

dd if=/dev/hdc of=CHUNK1 bs=1k count=2048 skip=0
dd if=/dev/hdc of=CHUNK2 bs=1k count=2048 skip=2048
dd if=/dev/hdc of=CHUNK3 bs=1k count=2048 skip=4096
...

then then i had to search in each of these 2Mb chunks to locate my file.
painful process and is not effective for overall recovery.

man dd for more.

saha
PS: i could recover my file at last :)

Did you have a power failure /  hard reset that resulted in a bad file
system? Try this:

1. Boot using your installation CD. 

2. goto the console of your installation CD (typically ALT+F2).

3. fsck your disk partition(s).

4. If  '3'  succeeds,  mount  the  disk partition(s).   If  this  step
   succeeds,  I think,  the problem  is elsewhere.   Not in  your hard
   drive/partitions/file system.

Hi!

Distro really doesn't matter. Its the software that
really matters. Again, you have the freedom to pick
whichever distro and whichever player you want. For
music, "xmms" is really nice. For movies, "mplayer" is
highly recommended.

There was some mention about NET4INDIA internet
connection in the list.Kindly note that LINUX is not
supported by the company.Either one develops a program
to access that service or use a proxy ( windows ) to
use the service on a LINUX box.

could you at least post what you have done and failed to get this thing
working already, so that people dont have to waste time figuring out what
might be wrong, and get you in teh right direction faster?

All three are off-the-shelf distros. There is nothing
like the best distro. Its all about choice. If you are
a newbie, I will definitely recommend SuSE Linux 9.1.

I  have very  little USB  experience  :) but  I would  try giving  the
'nousb' option  to the kernel while  booting to see  if that rectifies
it. If it does, its certainly to do with your new USB.

My camera would make the system hand when its connected to the USB and
switched on.   Interestingly, i  switched to a  higher version  of the
kernel and it worked. It could be a bug in your USB module. YMMV.

(Please dont send private replies.   Ask the ILUGC list.  For example,
if I'm making a mistake in  this reply, there is too little chance for
it to get corrected (bad for both of us).  While if this was sent to a
mailing list, its likely that somebody corrects the mistake.)

Ok, re-compiled my own kernel and installed pctel driver.  wvdial debs
were downloaded from packages.debian.org (from gentoo).  .. and i'm
sending this message from debian - happy :D

only issue with my devfs filesystem - no /dev/hdaX but /dev/discs/blah
.. looking a google .. no anti-aliased fonts in mozilla  ... many more
..hope i will resolve all issues now ...

Long live debian and gentoo.

next for a month there will be a bandwidth benchmark of debian and

devfs is depracated. Use udev [1] instead.

In my system, they look good. I didn't so anything for it though. Maybe
you should do
# dpkg -plow fontconfig

Why do you want to use devfs? I still dont use devfs (because this new
convention just  doesn't seem  intelligible to me).   I still  use the
plain old  /dev naming conventions.  Anti-aliased fonts, etc.,.   is a
breeze. enjoy STFWing :)

Hi,

> net4 india is giving internet connection in chennai &
> all overindia.(visit   net4india.com)
[snip]

I recently tookup a net4india connection and was not pleased with what I
got.  Here are my experiences -

  1. You do not get your internet connection from net4india directly.
     Instead its sold through distributors/resellers (read cable TV
     operators) who are often clueless about what they are selling.

     This results in extremely poor support.  The net4india guys are
     pretty responsive, but it's very difficult to reach the local
     reseller (well, mine was anyway... YMMV).

  2. The internet connection was offered through a cat5 cable.  I had to
     run a horrible win32 net4india application (visually similar to msn
     messenger) to 'login to the internet'.  No linux support at all.

  3. Extremely high latency connection - impossible to ssh out.

  4. You are behind a NAT box and get a private IP, and your apache will
     get no real world experience.

  5. Extremely poor Qos.  My connection frequently got disconnected and
     killed my ssh sessions.

In the end after paying a few thousand rupees and getting frustrated for
a week, I ended up calling them and cancelling my account.  I was not
refunded any money.

I don't recommend any of net4india's schemes until they get their act
together.


Other cheap internet providers -

1. Bharti - Rs 1,500/mth, 128kbps timed connection, but totally free
   from 10pm - 8am (comes to ~400MB daily).  Nightly 'apt-get -d'
   through cron should keep even sid users happy.  The downside is that
   you get a crappy usb dsl modem that has no linux support.  If you can
   buy your own modem, there's nothing like this one.

   Bharti also offers closed-user-group dsl connections for very low
   cost.  You can VPN to your office and work from home without having
   to wory about bandwidth usage :-)

2. Tata Indicom - I've only heard rumours that they offer 1xx kpbs flat
   access through their WLL cdma phone.  They charge Rs 1,500/mth.
   Would be great if someone can confirm this.

I use this Tata Indicom. 1xx kbps?  Ha Ha... yes, its 1xx kbps if x ==
"". ;) Seriously, I get  like 300bytes/sec nowadays.  At nights / some
random times it can go upto 8K/s. Nothing more than that. The 'signal'
on my phone shows all bars up so  I guess this is the max what one can
get. But since this thing is flat - Rs.1.5K, it works well for me in a
place where cable internet providers are too expensive (read: satyam).

  -Suraj, this email was sent at 300bytes/sec.

Impressive feat!

Can you please enlighten me as to -

  1. Why you prefer glibc-2.2.5's over 2.3.x?  

  2. Any ideas how BSD libc compares with glibc 2.2 and 2.3?

  3. In what areas is redhat 7.3 more robust over other versions?


Btw, the uptime on my current woody box is 117 days and is used by 20
odd people daily.  Nothing ever breaks on this box.  From my experience
every stable release of debian is the same story.  The best part is that
I've got a stable box without compiling a single thing!

I hope this convinces you to take a look at debian :-)

  It seems to be less flabby and more robust, but I cannot put my
finger on what exactly broke between RedHat 7.3 and RedHat 9 that
causes RH9 to be 15-25% slower, especially on DVD playback in
Xine, other things being equal.

>   2. Any ideas how BSD libc compares with glibc 2.2 and 2.3?

  No idea. Can you swap out glibc with BSD libc on any mainstream
Linux distro? If so, which ones?

  I can state with authority that uclibc is awesome for both size
and reliability for those applications that can be built with it
(mostly router-centric stuff). Routerlinux-1.1 comes in at about
12 MB installed, and has indeterminate uptime, i.e. it runs 24x7
without ever crashing. It's busybox + uclibc based.

  BTW, I've built both Samba and rsync against uclibc, after
jumping through some loops, for routerlinux.

>   3. In what areas is redhat 7.3 more robust over other versions?

  Actually, RedHat 6.2 is the best, if you can live with glibc-2.1.3 and
inetd instead of xinetd. It scores the best on uptime, responsiveness,
API/ABI stability, bug-free toolchains, etc. But RH 7.3 comes in
first on dependancy resolution - i.e. the ability
to build just about any source rpm (as long as it does not have libstdc++
dependancies) without too much upgrading and backtracking. With my
upgrade, things got even easier in that gcc-3.3 and libstdc++3 are
now standard, making it easy to migrate to the 2.6.x kernels and also
compile stuff like mplayer and so on, which depend on gcc3.

  Yes, I'll concede that Debian is good on uptime, but I had a Slackware
install on a HP Omnibook with uptime of over 3 years! OK, I cheated - the
Omnibook is an Instant On/Off machine, so most of that time it was
switched off but maintaining state - a kind of deep hibernation. It only
gave out when I forgot to charge the machine and the battery died out.

Hi!

How do you intend to conduct the competition? 

Does each participant play with the computer or do
participants (a pair) play amongst each other through
a network?

If each one is playing with the computer with
different system specs, then you shouldn't give any
time limit. Low system specs will definitely take long
time to make the moves. 

Usually, the computer doesn't take a long time to make
a move. You might want to set a timer for the
participant.

For choice of software and options, check this:

Assuming your are not talking about clustered chess AI, just fix the
search tree depth to some value and adhere to it for all competitions.

Message-ID: <411F1E62.000003.02868@SITHALADEVI>

Hello,
 
Request someone to help me getting Fedora Core 1 & 2 and Mandrake Linux 10
CD's.
I am planning to install in my Dell Inspiron 8600 laptop.
Open for any suggestions / experiences that you may have.

I had installed Xandros 2.0 and had also configured my Tochtel DSL Modem,
unfortunately Linux did not startup two days after that.
Some virus had corrupted my partition table since my machine is a Dual Boot
with Win XP. Now I have deleted the partition and wanting to install
Mandrake or Fedora.
 
Anyone experienced with Fedora Core 1/2 ?
Also, would like to know the fundamental difference between Fedora Core 1 &
2.

Send me a mail offlist if anyone could arrange for the CD's, alternatively
you could call on my mobile 9841562146.

            Thanx, Sriram

  Just an update: I upgraded to modutils-2.4.25-8 (google for the SRPM)
and built linux-2.6.8.1 on the upgraded RedHat 7.3+ system. Rebooted
into linux-2.6.8.1, and voila! *everything* works just fine. Well,
almost everything - cryptoloop is not on-disk compatible with the
patched cryptoloop on 2.4.x

  X on this setup is startling when you're used to 2.4 - the mouse
pointer and the windows just glide effortlessly. I guess this is one
of the reasons that people feel that Gentoo is faster - with a 2.6
kernel, the UI is far more responsive than 2.4, which is the stock
kernel in RH 7.3, 8, 9 and FC1. 

  Also tested qemu-0.60 running Windows 98 SE (blasphemy!) in an emulated
x86 environment in this setup, and it was quite usable, at least for
playing Freecell.

  My next project is to try to upgrade RedHat 6.2 to gcc-3.3 &
linux-2.6.x, while retaining glibc-2.1.3. A major challenge is to build
glibc-2.1.3 using gcc-3.3, and then bootstrap gcc-3.3.  BTW, fixes for
correctly compiling linux 2.6.x with gcc-3.3 are still coming in (check
the Changelog for 2.6.8.1), but most of the miscompiles are in obscure
drivers. Gcc-3.4 and 3.5 also have miscompilation issues with linux-2.6.
Nothing to worry about for now, but I'll keep on the lookout for kernel
barfs.

I dont if this idea has been floating around for a while but i just needed

propagat linux as the desktop of tommorrow we should look at starting our
idea marketing at the level where my five year old cousine presses the
Windoze button.

So we should think of inviting school teachers to our gatherings and find
the difficulties they face if they were introduced to Linux and work on
overcoming them. And hence giving birth to a new generation if Linux users.

It should be an initiative worth the attempt if each of us brought a Comp
Science Teacher from a school in the neighborhood.

You have to be specific as to which distro you are
talking about.

SuSE Linux is made to compete in the desktop market.
Hats off to Novell for doing an excellent job! It is
THE best distro for commercial large-scale deployment.
If I were a sys admin I would introduce it to
school/corporate environments.

If you haven't tried it, I would encourage you to do
so.

[ i am also planning to introduce a syllabus suitable for school children. , 
even in my school, i am unable to introduce it successfully ]

but this thread will eatup the space of the usergroup. and it many not help

Hi,

I am  a third year computer science engineering student. I want to pursue my 
career
as a network administrator. I have few questions. So, kindly answer these 
questions
if you can.

1) Are fresh engineering gradutates recruited in IT Infrastructure domain?
2) What are the qualities that are needed?
3) What are the qualities the industry expects from us?
4) What will be my future prospects in that domain?
5) What are the technical knowledge needed?
6) what salary  should I expect as a fresher?

I am mailing this to the group only because that there are many experienced 
people from whom I
can get advice. If anybody feel this is not correct, please be free to point 
out it.


Thank You ALL,
Sriram K.

Good troubleshooting skills. Of course, you need to
know how to install and configure stuff. Experience is
the key (also get certifications, if possible). If you
have two (or more) computers at home, you can learn by
installing/configuring setups.

> 4) What will be my future prospects in that domain?

Companies can't run corporate networks w/o network and
system admins.

> 5) What are the technical knowledge needed?

Servers, Network protocols, System/network
administration, Security (network AND system side),
Wireless, Scripting, DNS, DHCP, TCP/IP, ... to name a
few.

Wherever you are, the network admin job requires good
skill and experience. You will not have work most of
the time. But, when a problem arises, you will have
hell a lot of troubleshooting and work to do (everyone
will be behind you to get things back and running). It
does give you a feeling that you own and control the
whole corporate network :)

For college students, if you can do part-time
sys/network admin jobs during your coll life, it will
be useful experience, (in college or as interns during
summer). 

You should keep yourself updated with what is going on
in the Security and Networking industry. There are
plenty of mailing lists and forums for these.

Just my $0.02,

Good luck,

Shaks

I heartily second the recommendation. It's an excellent book - both for 
sysadmins, and for people who have to manage sysadmins / remain in 
overall charge of a network.

TAMIL INTERNET 2004 - CALL FOR PAPERS
16 August 2004 ? The seventh International Tamil Internet Conference 
("Tamil Internet 2004"), to be held in Singapore on 11 and 12 
December 2004, is now calling for papers to be submitted to the 
conference.
Tamil Internet 2004 is organised by the International Forum for 
Information Technology in Tamil (INFITT) with the support of 
Singapore's Tamil Internet Steering Committee and other 
organisations. It will be held at the National University of 
Singapore premises.
A Conference Programme Committee (CPC) has been formed with Dr. K. 
Kalyanasundaram of Switzerland as the Chair, Mr. Arun Mahizhnan of 
Singapore as Vice-Chair and Mr. N. Maalan (India), Mr. A. Elangovan 
(India), Mr. D. Sivaraj (India), Dr. Vasu Renganathan (USA) as 
members), to deal with paper submission and scheduling of the 
conference content. Prof. V. Sankaranarayanan, Director of Tamil 
Virtual University, Chennai, has agreed to serve as Advisor to the 
CPC for Tamil Internet 2004.
In contrast to multi-hub, large audience format of earlier Tamil 
Internet Conferences (TICs), Tamil Internet 2004 will be an 
intensive, focused technical conference with only one session 
scheduled at a time. More time will be devoted to in-depth 
collective discussions (workshop style) than in formal 
presentations. 
"Tamil IT for Tomorrow " has been chosen as the theme for the Tamil 
Internet 2004 conference. We invite technical papers on all topics 
relating Tamil Information Technology. The deadline for paper 
abstracts is 16 September and for the full paper, November 16. There 
will be a peer review of the submitted papers before acceptance. The 
abstract should be detailed enough for CPC to make a decision on 
acceptance. After the review, successful candidates will be informed 
before end September. 
To assist the CPC select papers for formal presentations, please 
send us one or two pages (A4 size) of the abstract of your 
presentation by the above date. Papers may be presented in English, 
Tamil or bilingual (Tamil-English) format. As with the earlier TICs, 
all submissions must be in electronic form. For papers with content 
in Tamil or are bilingual, please use either TAB or TSCII (version 
1.7) encoding. Characters that are not part of the encoding 
prescribed must be included as images (jpg/gif). The outline/summary 
of your presentation should also include your full name, 
designation, address, email and contact numbers. 
We assume that submission of a paper for possible presentation at 
Tamil Internet 2004 implies attendance at the conference and 
presentation in person by at least one author of the paper. The 
Singapore organizers have offered to provide free boarding and 
lodging, free conference registration to one author of each paper 
accepted for oral presentation.

As in the past, papers presented in the conference will be archived, 
printed and distributed as INFITT sees fit and INFITT will retain 
the rights for these purposes.
We would appreciate very much if you take note of the deadlines and 
adhere to them:

my problem is there is no space left in the /
partition to install oracle, it require minimum 500MB
of space to install. Is it possible to resize my /

of my 73GB HDD. another 50% is unused. Iam using the
/dev/sda6 for  backuping files. Even i can delete the
partition if it is needed.

Please fing me solution.

BlankI guess you are getting it wrong, i m not bothered about the distros,
it might be fedora, suse, mandrake, slackware, or any others...

but the idea is to send across a message as linux could to what you have
been using, easily and at times even better, and has got a huge support base
in case of problems.

Hi,
  You can use some of the tools to resize partition. The
  KISS way of (or say dumb) is copying /usr to /home and
  doing symbolic link. It is not one of the smartest way
  of resizing partiton.

  In future, LVM is the way to go. Any bad decissions about
  creating partitions can be rectified easily with volume
  manager.

As the subject line says, my Linux Technical Resource Kit from Novell
arrived today by 1st class mail. It contains 3 DVDs, all of which are
licensed for evaluation only (transfer prohibited):

2004 DVD 1.1A:

 SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server 9
 Nterprise Linux Services 1.0
 Ximian Desktop 2
 ConsoleOne

2004 DVD 1.1B:

 SUSE LINUX Professional 8.2
 GroupWise 6.5.1
 Red Carpet Enterprise Server 2.02
 Linux Resources

2004 DVD 1C:

 SUSE LINUX Professional 9.1

I'll check if there are ISOs included, but it looks like the 3rd DVD is
a liveDVD only, i.e. you need to boot from it. Even if there are ISOs,
it looks like they can't be redistributed.

Perhaps the most useful items are the SUSE 8.2, 9 & 9.1 and Ximian distros.

Hi,
  is anyone able to use 2.6 kernel and have anyone tested the preemtive nature of the kernel 2.6.When visited kernel.org I could download some tar package I tried to apply patch, but in kernel compilation it is giving error.Is there any rpm package of 2.6 kernel source so that I can freshly compile it and bott thru that kernel.If anyone is using 2.6 kernel successfully please give me complete procedure to boot thru that kernel.With 2.4 kernel I have written test program to test preemtiveness OR non-preemtiveness nature of the kernel.One kernel 2.6 installed I can test that.

  It was being given away by Novell at conferences and trade
shows for free. In July, they had an offer on their website
by which you could order it direct from Novell at no cost,
if you filled in some basic information on a web form. I did
so fairly early.

It had an overwhelming response, so those who ordered it then
are only starting to get it now (It looks like I am an early
recipient).

The first two DVDs have ISOs, but apparently cannot be
redistributed as CDs (I need to check out their policies
regarding ISOs - are downloadable SUSE ISOs redistributable?)
All the products are apparently the full commercial versions,
without support (which can be purchased for the cost of the
retail boxed sets. These prices are fairly reasonable: i.e.
SUSE 9.1 Professional is USD 99 retail, which is much less
than RedHat Enterprise Linux 3, which starts at about USD 3000
for 1 year.).

The 3rd DVD is a bootable install DVD, not a liveDVD as I
mistakenly stated. You need a DVD drive to install it, but it
seems to be the full SUSE 9.1 Pro. I'm now hunting for a spare
machine with a DVD drive to install it on.

Download sources.
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.4.tar.bz2
Unzip.
gzip -cd linux-2.6.XX.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Read the README file from line 1 to $
Make sure you have the right gcc version.(gcc -v)

Compiling 2.6.xx is not much different than previous version. Only
difference I can see is that make dep is made redundant and the actual
compilation is shown more neatly on screen.

Preemptable kernel should be chosen while doing make menuconfig in the
page Processor type and features.

Hope you know how to make the new grub or lilo entries, if not then
google.

Can you share with us what methodology you were using to test the
pre-emptive ness of the kernel?

  Please take care to use <CR> to break lines - don't rely on line wrap,
as it is painful to quote the original on followup.

  Anyway, check my previous posting on the list - I have compiled and
am using kernel 2.6.8.1 (from kernel.org) with a heavily upgraded RedHat
7.3 install. However, the only thing you actually need to upgrade is
modutils.

> When visited kernel.org I could download some

  What error? You can download the full tarball, or just the patches
from 2.6.0->2.6.1->...2.6.8.1, starting with the 2.6.0 tarball. If
you went with the patches, did they apply cleanly? There should be
*no* rejects or warnings. 

> Is there any rpm package of 2.6 kernel source so that I

  There are SRPMs for the 2.6 kernel, but these have heavy dependancies
on other RPMs in the specific distro they are meant for (e.g. SUSE Linux
9.1 Professional). I recommend that you stick with the kernel.org tarballs.

> If anyone is using

  Google is your friend. There is no change from kernel 2.4 except a
dependancy on a newer version of modutils - just about everything else
*just works*.

  No need to test - the preemptible kernel and the O(1) scheduler, with
the interactiveness boost provided by the celebrated Molnar-Morton-Torvalds
"Combo Patch" work superbly. You will immediately notice the difference
in the way the mouse moves in X.

Here is an analogy that not everybody will relate to: it's like switching
from a Mercedes 300D (diesel) to a 300E (petrol). Both are built like
tanks and are rock-stable, but the 300E is very quick and nimble, can
turn on a dime, and is very easy to maintain on top of that. But the
steering wheel and controls are exactly in the same location.

hi all,
   pls give me a solution for this,
many people use my system and my account, so i thought of creating a a
file , say 1 GB of file and format it  using some file system, may be
some encrypted file system . it should be mountable only by me by
providing a password during mount(not account password) . i dont login
into root, and i dont want to be root , i use it rarely. so that the
entire file system can be copied over disks and taken backup.
if u know how to implement this pls provide the steps , even if you
dont know the commands, pls give me the module , or package that i
should use.

regrds,
Ananth.G

Nice approach....
Some general comments are
-The while loop can be in an ioctl rather than in the init_module. So that you can do repeated testing.
-The condition (jiffies != num) can be dangerous, especially in a preemptible kernel, it should be (jiffies < num) otherwise there is a danger of going into an infinite loop.
-If init_module returns -1, I don't think it would be successfully loaded. Done intentionally ?
If the above were a result of a quickly written module then please ignore the comments.

Gopu.

?
Thanks a lot for the reply, I will do that, I have given small kernel module which I feel this is the way of testing preemptiveness of the kernel.The below shown module I am using

#define __KERNEL__
#define MODULE
#include<linux/kernel.h>
#include<linux/module.h>
#include<linux/sched.h>


static int init_module(void)
{
unsigned long num=jiffies+(10*HZ);
while(jiffies!=num) {

? //schedule(); /* uncomment this line to relinquish the CPU*/
? ? ? ? }

return -1;
}

static void cleanup_module(void)
{
? ? ? ? printk("module unloaded\n");
}



When you try to load the above module since it is a non-preemptible kernel, it will in that loop for 10 secs(since it is jiffies+(10*HZ)).So during that U try type some thing OR try to move the mouse since it is non-premtible kernel you can't do anything.If it is a pr-emtible it will allow you to do so(This is what my way of testing if any comments OR better way of testing pls let me know).

Sangharsh

"At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the    
computer industry with the auto industry and stated,"If GM had kept up     
with the technology like the computer industry has, we would all be        
driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon."                   
                                                                           
In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release      
stating: If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be    
driving cars with the following characteristics:                           
                                                                           
1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.             
                                                                           
2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy  
a new car.                                                                 
                                                                           
3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would 
have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut  
off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. 
For some reason you would simply accept this.                              
                                                                           
4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your 
car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to    
reinstall the engine.                                                      
                                                                           
5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable,   
five times as fast and twice as easy to drive - but would run on only five 
percent of the roads.                                                      
                                                                           
6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be  
replaced by a single "This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation" Warning 
light.                                                                     
                                                                           
7. The airbag system would ask "Are you sure?" before deploying.           
                                                                           
8. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and 
refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle,      
turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.                      
                                                                           
9. Every time a new car was introduced car buyers would have to learn how  
to drive all over again, because none of the controls would operate in the 
same manner as the old car.                                                
                                                                           
10. You'd have to press the "Start" button to stop the car.

Hi,
  Check for df, any partition is full? free -m output, uptime output
  and check number of files in /var/log.

  This is my grain of salt.

Message-ID: <8816fcf8040817091839be8f31@mail.gmail.com>

In the middle of apt-getting (downloading), I simply disconnected
(from dialup conn.) and dialed again.  But apt-get is still handing up
(freezed) without downloading anything (though the connection is
available).

When I was using gentoo, even wget seemed to suffer from this problem.

This particularly troubles me, as my dialup service (sancharnet) is
unreliable so I couldn't defer the downloads over-night.

You misunderstood  the term "resume"  ;) do apt-get upgrade  and while

Dear friends,

This is Nokia Mobile related issue...

 

I first thought dnokii was the only program ...

When i tried gammu,I was surprised

 

It provides all facilities provided by Nokia Smart Suite...

It works problem fre for 3100 and 6610...

Those who want to use gnokii or gammu please read compatibility and bug reports...

because some handsets and firmware hang be careful

 

thank you

The problem is automating this when the line automatically gets busy
or down (eg. sancharnet.)

/etc/ppp/ip-up.local and /etc/ppp/ip-down.local (though debian does like 
renaming config files and changing their paths all over the place to fit 
them into debconf, which makes it a bit of a nuisance finding the right 
file to edit sometimes)

it's not a resume in that sense at all. If the process gets stopped if 
your internet connection just went away, you do have to download the 
package again with wget at least.

If you use an ftp mirror of debian, and an ftp client like lftp or ncftp 
you have a few more options - a lot of ftp servers can resume broken 
downloads better than http servers can.

That's not my problem at all.  The downloader can resume.  But
sometimes the (dialup) connection is still there, but no data is
trasfered (0% flat line).  wget (or whatever) just hangs up in the
same percentage.  Had the connection lost, I would have redialled and
re-started the apt process (some script).  But in my case, I am struck
in the middle.

I don't think it is possible (or CellRenderer does anything?).  But I
suggest you to use VBox instead of TreeView, if you have list data. 
And pack the widget specific to a tree row in VBox--not flexible
though.

EXACTLY! This is what I have  been trying to emphasize on when I meant
"handle disconnections" in  my earlier mails. Once upon  a time when I
was crazy about  upgrading everyday, I was so  frustrated with my vsnl
connection that I used to have a cron job that ran every hour after 10
PM (which is when I start  upgrading debian) and kills apt-get and the
ppp line and then reconnects and restarts the upgrade. tch tch... very
dirty. but it worked.

cheers,

Installation charges depends on the cable TV operator in your area.

A small correction here is that it is not 40 KBps but 40 Kbps. That is a 
decent speed for an unlimited data transfer.

Dear Friends,

It seems to be costlier connection when compared with BSNL. BSNL offers 
second telephone line for existing landline phone subscribers. This 
second line is dedicated only for Internet. You can use BSNL NetOne 
Accountless Internet package with this line.

No installation charges.
Monthly rental of Rs 499/- or Rs 399/- depends on your telephone 
exchange irrespective of usage.
Your NetOne charges will be extra at the rate of Rs 6 per hour of 
connection.
Unlimited download.
24 hours available. (i.e NO TIME LIMIT or BANDWIDTH LIMIT).
Download speed is 4 to 5 KB/Sec consistently. At worst case it is 2.5 
KB/Sec.

T.KaruppuSwamy

I don't think Sify is costlier than BSNL.

Justification:

Assuming you are online for 10 hours a day, your Netone charges will be 
INR. 1800 (300x6). Also you have to pay INR. 499 for the phone line 
which put together comes to INR. 2299 which is nearly four times the 
rate of Sify.

PS: If you assume that you are online for 24 hours a day, the amount is 
even more higher. Please correct me if I am wrong. Sridhar is using this 
connection. He can give a bigger picture on this.

Hi,

	I enquired about the Sify Connection. These are the details that
I received:
1)	The Installation charges depend on the availability of some
other Sify customer in your neighbourhood. This means that if your
neighbour has it, then the charges are minimal. If no one in your area
has it, then "God save you".
2)	The monthly rental is Rs.600 for unlimited usage at 256Kbps/6 =
48.x Kbps. In other words, 256 Kbps is divided into a maximum of 6
users.

	Though the first point seems to suggest towards BSNL connection,
as the installation cost is lesser in BSNL, this is a one time cost and
can be overlooked when compared to the continuous cost incurred due to
telephone bills. Also the BSNL connection seems to be based on
telephones not cable connection. The latter is a better technology
(IMHO). So I prefer that.

I have got the same connection from sify ( Rs 2500 installation charge + 600
monthly). Decent 24 hr connection considering just 600 rupees a
month(Atleast I am satisfied). They say initial charge will vary  based on
Area but they almost charge 2500 flat.

In RH9 the installation did not go correctly, after quite a bit of trouble I

Sify Bbcliet for RH9 atleast doesnot work smoothly after the installation
also. Even Today If I connect to Sify using RH9 I may not be able to browse.
The status reporting tool will also be inconsitent.

In any case this connection is Far better from ur dialups

Yes Mr. Praveen. For the heavy usage like 10s of hours BSNL is NOT 
CHEAP. I agree. For a user like me who use to browse at home for 1 or 1 
1/2 hour for a day (rest of the hour spent in office.. :) :) ), this 
would be a better choice since there is no huge initial cost of 
installation. Performance also very good.

I have got the same connection from sify ( Rs 2500 installation charge +

month(Atleast I am satisfied). They say initial charge will vary  based
on
Area but they almost charge 2500 flat.

In RH9 the installation did not go correctly, after quite a bit of
trouble I
managed to install sify Broad band client.
Sify Bbcliet for RH9 atleast doesnot work smoothly after the

Gentlemen

Thanks for your replies.
I concluded that the chipset used in the ZyAir has linux drivers based on a perticular web site 
but it is not so.

Could you let me know whether your wireless adapter works with freebsd / linux or has drivers for it.
If so could you tell me where it is available in chennai ?

According to some preliminary googling you might want to try the 
orinoco_cs drivers - its a prism 2.x / zcomax clone pcmcia rather than a 
pci card.

Alternatively if you have windows drivers for that card you can run them 
under linux using http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net

I'm connected to the net using a centrino ipw2200 inbuilt wlan card 
right now - using ndiswrapper and the windows drivers for the card.

Hi

What is the reason for RH9 not being supported by Sify. Is it because of 
their cable modem or some other reason. I am planning to get a

 I havent spent enough time debugging . All I can say is on RH9 the
installation will not be smooth. 

Since I have 2 comps (one running win2K) I didn't bother to do too much R&D
on making it work on RH9.

Sify customer support will also be of little help when it comes to Linux.

What error? Have they gone and hardcoded dependencies on gui or other 
libs / paths of some kind?

Just run the dialer off the command line (launch it from a shell instead 
of clicking on an icon in kde / gnome) and see

I tried it now on my fedora core 1 which has mozilla 1.4.1. It does not 
work. It installs ok but when you try to run the application it just 
closes the window. Maybe it works on latest mozilla.

This is not linux based, but I'll give you the simplest and best option: 
Bloglines.

http://www.bloglines.com

It is web-based, so you can read your subscriptions from everywhere, and 
the rate at which they add features and support for new formats (like 
Atom) is simply awesome. Try it once, and you'll be hooked. Plus, no 
irritating ads. If you use firefox, even better. There is a extension 
which easily allows you to sign up to a feed just with a mouse click. 
They even give you a email id, which lets you read email you can read 
from your bloglines account (isnt' that awesome? rss-enabled email!) and 
LOTS of other features. I have no idea how they make money out of this, 
but it simply *rocks*.

facing a small issue.

Issue:

If I do telnet from host B to host A without FDQN, it
takes some time to get resolved.Some other utilities
like ping,dns lookup query gets the name resolved
without any delay. 
  If I use 'telnet A.xyz.com', then it gets resolved
without any delay. 

The dns client config files like /etc/resolv.conf,
/etc/hosts.conf & /etc/nsswitch.conf are fine

I am facing this issue for some clients only. 

What may be the problem? 

Sarav

hello .
I have installed sify dilaler on Mandrake10,
Xandros2.0.

Both are working without any problem. There is no gui
in sify dialer & it is very simple
It should work on RH 9,   as RH 9 & mdk10 are very
similar

I use BSNL 2nd line (Rs. 540 per month).  Just paying that (apart from
paying once for 100hrs package to VSNL), I am enjoying 100 MB download
every night--more than enough for keeping a debian system updated
(Every morning I will see the updated system :-).

I will go for sify if the speed is guaranteed not to fall below 3.5 or 3 .

Daily updates won't download more than 10 MB on average.  So within an
hour or so the computer will automatically shut down.

$ (apt-get update && apt-get -d dist-upgrade); echo -e "\a"; sleep 60;
echo -e "\a"; ./done

And when going to sleep, I will do ..

$ cat > ./done
/sbin/poweroff
$

(Morning)
$ apt-get dist-upgrade
$ # Fresh system!

This is possible.

You can connect two computers through their USB port using something
called an USB networking device. Once this is done, they can form an IP
network and any protocol build over IP can be used --- NFS, FTP, HTTP,
etc.

It is probably because that hyper-threading is turned ON in the bios.

damn, the installation is starting to look more slackware-ish

the last time i saw debian was years back .. dselect endless loop made 
me rather allergic to it.

slackware installed without a single hitch .. and except for a brief 
flirt or two with deadrat and suse i haven't used anything else for 
quite some time

got to try it again

Dear Jayapaul,

Pl. check the web for any kernel update is available for your system.. 
the same problem seems to solved by some kernel as mentioned at the end 
of the web page: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=123960
I hope this link may be useful to you.

  I used slackware for a long time - but pkgtool doesn't support
dependancies (has that been fixed now?), so you're dead in the
water when you try to install/upgrade/backtrack etc.

  Moi - I swear by deadrat. It's delicious. You should try it
sometime again. I just did my first SuSE installation (8.2) yesterday,
and it was nowhere near as smooth as a default RedHat 7.3 install.
SuSE does come with a larger number of packages, out of the box.

  Apart from the earlier advice of upgrading the kernel,
I'd also add that you've chosen the wrong OS for this system.
FC2 is a desktop-oriented distro, not an enterprise server.
The bugs (and there are many) have not been worked out yet.
You'd be better off with RH Advanced Server 2.1 or Enterprise
Linux 3, or the free as in free lunch alternative: White
Box Enterprise Linux.

Message-ID: <200408191654.57027.arvy@kongu.ac.in>

Hi all,


	 I just got myself a Wipro LittleGenius CP laptop.

	Everything works fine, almost out of the box. Except the centrino. I am able 
to detect the card and stuff. Im unable to connect to an access point.

Here is what I did:

1. Installed SuSE 9.1
2. Downloaded and installed firmware from ipw2100.sf.net
3. Downloaded and compiled the module for the same.
4. Loaded the  module.
5. ipw2100 is detected.
6. YaST is started for configuring the IP and such. No DHCP here.
7. I do `dmesg` and I see 'Association lost'. Meaning that it connected and 
then was forced out due to WEP stuff.

Note: Im able to use the PCMCIA WLAN card and connect to the AP. 

Its a D-link AP and adapter pair that I am using right now for connectivity. I 
sincerely hope someone has setup centrino around here with WEP stuff.

Thanks in advance.

it kind of does track em .. though not in the extremely anal retentive 
way debian does.

use something like autosource or autoslack (to build slackware-current 
from source, kinda like gentoo), or use swaret to stay current with 
slackware packages

what happens here is that slackware sets you free .. no safety net at 
all.  it just assumes that if you are root, you dont need your hands 
held and stuff spoonfed to you

yea - but i use a VERY limited set of packages.

sure i can wave around an 8 cd pack full of random apps that i'd never 
use at all - but what use is that to me? :)

i think you'd have an ipw2200 centrino on most modern pentium M chipsets

i'd suggest that you use the ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net (free, gpl) or 
driverloader ($20 after 30 days free, www.linuxant.com) driver wrappers 
and install the windows drivers

It does wep too as far as I can see, and connects me at 802.11g (54 
Mbps) - the ipw drivers just do 802.11b

also install the wireless-tools rpm (though suse should have done that 
for you as you are associated using a pcmcia card .. stuff like iwconfig 
etc ...)

It'll detect the interface as wlan0 - so you might have to create a 
separate file setting for wlan0 like eth0 etc (like 
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/wlan0 in redhat - dunno what its in suse)

Note: the linuxant site has a link to a 16kstacks patch for 2.6 that 
you'll need for both ndiswrapper and linuxant - the centrino uses 12k of 
stack - you typically have upto 4k tops.

	srs

ps - this is typed on an acer travelmate 292 laptop running slackware 
10, kernel 2.6.8.1 with the 16kstacks patch, some ACPI patches ... 
[still got to configure ACPI properly on this one .. the laptop shipped 
with rh9 and a custom 2.4.20 kernel, that wasn't too much to my taste]

I think it's not of much difference from the old installer, except for
easier package selection.

I suggest you to try out debian.  Even if slackware comes up with some
dependency handling stuff, slack cannot become debian.  Once you try
debian, you'll never look back.

For me the only problem with debian is the package naming conventions
.. vim-python, vim-gnome, vim-gtk all are full gvim binaries ... and
.. python2.2-gnome, python2.3-gnome, ...  Gentoo excells in this,
without lot of other disadvantages.

If you have a good internet connection, single CD is enough.  But 13
CDs pack will be definitely helpful for a guy with no network. He need
not *download* anything just because of installing some unusual
package that he never used before.

Can you tell you platform and kernel version?
As a quick solution, just comment the call to synchronize_irq() function and compile the module again

Yes, definitely.

root:~# export HTTP_PROXY = http://your.proxy.server:proxy-port

Then if you have http mirrors in your apt.sources list, you will get apt 
to pull down these packages through your proxy server.

Seems there's a dependency failure i.e a lower level
module is needed so as to insmod this driver. Try
modprobe.

AFAK these network drivers need another low-level
module mii.o. so try insmoding mii.o first and then
8139too.o

More information on the kernel version and whether its
a kernel compiled by u or from a standard distribution
will help us in providing a detailed solution.

heh. He already has one box and he wants to get another box to try out
networking.

What I would suggest is to  volunteer at some small training center or
something  (where, anyway, their  knowledge of  networking /  linux is
low) and set things up for 'free'.

You can use UML (User-Mode Linux) on a single system

Being an old debian hand, I find this installer annoying.  Too much
chatter.   The installer's job is to bootstrap your machine with a
self-sufficient stand-alone distro as easily as possible.  The second
stage installer 'base-config' can be as smart as it wants.

The potato installer was the best, as simple as a knife and fork.  All
you need to get the potato installer going was a kernel, a rootfs and
the live fs tarball.  You could easily get it going on extremely tricky
hardware - no fdd, cdrom, etc.

Infact installing potato was so easy that you did not even need the
installer!   Just untar the live fs tar ball into a dir and chroot.
Minor configuration and presto!  Instant potato installation inside a
chroot!

With potato even cross-installation was feasible. Say you had a Arm
board on which you needed to install potato.  You could untar the live
fs tar ball into a dir on your PC and nfs export it.  Then just boot the
Arm machine with an appropriate kernel and mount root over nfs.
That's it.

All this was possible because the first stage installer did a simple
job.  Woody was still manageable, but sarge looks bad.  Maybe with time
we'll get used to the beast.

I'm sure you realise that you don't have to use dselect if you don't
like it.  Tasksel and apt can be run anytime later.

If you want to customize, it is better not to use a distribution.

These are versions of a few packages on my system

GNU bash        3.00.0(1)-release
vim             6.3 compiled Aug 18 2004
gcc             3.3.4 (Debian 1:3.3.4-9)
KDE             3.3.0
Mozilla Firefox 0.9.3

You have more recent versions of packages in your _desktop_ ?

bash3, firefox nightly trunk build (ditto thunderbird), gcc 3.3.4 
(default with slackware 10 btw).  gnome 2.6 - not kde and havent 
downloaded the latest gnome yet (saving that for my next trip abroad)

i'd have fun trying to change those on anything but slackware

Message-ID: <20040821043723.412D51B3F5@whitebox.dias.ath.cx>


A recent visit to Ritchie st. revealed that a Tyan dual-processor Opteron
board is available on order, as are Opteron 240 CPUs (dual capable 1.4 GHz).
The price quoted was a reasonable <Rs.20k for the board and about Rs.12.5k
per CPU, making it sub-Rs.50k for a dual-processor config. Add memory,
drives, etc. and you're still well below Rs. 1 lakh for what is definitely
the fastest 64-bit Linux server platform available in India (in recent
Anandtech benchmarks, the Opteron 150 uniprocessor at 2 GHz obliterated
the Nocona Xeon EM64T 3.6 GHz on most application benchmarks).

I'm curious to hear if anybody has tried out a 64-bit x86-64 install of
any standard distro, and what their experiences were. In particular, is
it possible to install standard i386 elf binaries (say, from a .i386 rpm),
and expect it to run without recompilation on an Opteron box running a
64-bit kernel?

FWIW, Athlon 64/2800 (single processor) CPU + board is also available for
around Rs.12-13k.

  Thanks, it looks like the kinks are still being ironed out for mixed-mode
(64-bit as well as 32-bit) userland glibc support. But it's certainly
possible, it appears.

  I'm considering the Athlon 64, for sure. That one has dropped in price
from Rs.30k to ~Rs.12k in something like 9 months.

Looks like you are using `sid`.  Did you experience any problems with
that.  I use `testing`.  I am thinking of switching to `sid`. What do

It seems that your postgresql database is configured for IDENT 
authentication scheme. In that case,  the UNIX user-id of the executing 
CGI script (apache webserver, apropriately) must be the same user as the 
postgres database user. I believe that this is not the case (CGI scripts 
normally run as user 'nobody' or 'apache' on most Linux distributions).

You might want to edit your pg_hba.conf file and change the 
authentication scheme for 'user1' from 'ident' to 'password' or 'crypt' 
scheme.

The URL http://www.faqs.org/docs/ppbook/c15679.htm has some good 
documentation on how to modify authentication scheme in your pg_hba.conf 
file.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Dear Friend
Confiure your pg_hba.conf file for user authentication. Authenication type set in your pg_hba.con seems to be of type ident change it or do the suitable settins.

Subject: [Ilugc] Boot problem
Message-ID: <32b5ee76040821085935c3cad9@mail.gmail.com>

This is the original table that i had b4 doing an experiment to make
my system run faster with a 128MB (Goods Train) RAM and C drive had
only 600MB free space.I converted my primary C from FAT32 to NTFS.
previously:
WinXP in C Drive 4 GB
	D:\ 6 GB
	E: 4 GB
	Linux swap 256 MB HDA8
	Linux Ext2 HDA7
	XOSL installed in C-Drive
	XOSL was sitting on MBR
	I could choose XP or Linux,LILO on HDA7

Unfortunately now i have a different problem.
When i converted C to NTFS ,XOSL was lost
sys did not boot,used Win98 boot disk and Fdisk /MBR ,for starting
windows(due to emergency)
then got panicked
used Mandrake 10.0 community edition boot CD and used rescue
i coudnt use rescue since it was unable to install bootloader on
primary partition
(c drive)
failing which i tried to upgrade my existing installation to the same
edition itself(10.0 community to 10.0 community) but got errors since
it said it was unable to mount a NTFS/HPFS partition.
went to /mnt/boot/grub/ (dev/HDA7 was mounted after e2fsck by the
linux rescue tool on /mnt ) in linux partition using rescue console
and tried to do sh grub-install /dev/hda7
grub boot loader over-wrote the existing lilo graphical boot loader in HDA7
now i got enlightened and created a partition with partition magic for
30MB and installed XOSL there.then used that loader
but now since new partition has been created  the entire table is
changed(obviously)


position is like this:(as shown by partiotion magic)
c:\ NTFS 4.5 GB(primary)
extended 14 GB
	D: FAT32 6GB
	Local Disk 39.2 MB (XOSL)
	g: FAT32 4 GB
	SWAPSPACE2 Linux Swap 243.1 mB
	Local Disk Linux EXT2 4GB


now my prob is that when i boot to linux all i get is the grub
loader.but when i try to find VMLinuz file to load the kernel (i
gaveTabSpace to c the root dir files) but it is listing my E drive.so
unable to boot to linux
i dont have much exposure to grub
what has to be done to correct this problem and the steps req to start
with grub itself.
thanks in advance.

I have faced no problems.

If you think uptime to be a measure of stability, my current uptime is
26 days, and the previous one 95 days (went down as a result of loss of
power).

At the grub> prompt, maybe you must try the following sequence of commands:
--------------
   root (hd0,6)
   kernel /boot/vmlinuz
   boot
--------------
(hd0,6) is grub's way of accessing hda7.

/boot/vmlinuz must be replaced by the correct path to your linux kernel 
(using tab completion might help) in the above commands.

Once you boot successfully, you might want to create a menu.lst at the 
grub config location (generally, /boot/grub/menu.lst) with a menu of 
choices for your OS to boot. 

Let me know if you've had success with booting from the above commands.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

If you don't know about it as yet... that website was supposed to be one 
of those April Fool's joke that tried to make its way to slashdot news 
few years back.

There is no such thing called "Microsoft Linux".  Most likely, there 
will be Longhorn in few of years to come.

If you are still not convinced, try reading the news section more 
closely  at the M$ jokes and/or try a 'whois' query on mslinux.org to 
get what I mean.

Subject: [Ilugc] Kernel upgrade problem 2.4.18-14 to latest 2.6.8.1 kernel
Message-ID: <412822E4.3090102@tandbintl.com>

Dear Friends,

I am in the process of upgrading my Redhat 8.0 kernel 2.4.18-14 to 
latest 2.6.8.1 kernel. All configuration, compilation, boot loader went 
through fine. The 2.6.8.1 kernel loaded successfully without any error. 
When the /etc/ rc.sysinit script is executed I have the problem of /proc 
filesystem error. Since in 2.6.8.1 kernel proc filesystem ( /proc ) has 
been replaced with sysfs (/sys), it is facing issues in finding the 
/sys/mount file and other files in /sys. Script is not able to run the 
fsck on mounted file system. I replaced all the reference to /proc file 
system in rc.sysinit with  /sys file system.

Can anybody help me on this?

Regards
T.KaruppuSwamy

No. sysfs and procfs are two different things altogether. sysfs is a 
virtual filesystem like procfs, but it provides information only about 
hardware/devices of your system. procfs consists of various stuff 
exported by the kernel to the userland programs (which include process 
information, mount-points, memory-maps, module specific exported data , 
hardware information, networking subsystem, and so on).

You must enable procfs support in your kernel configuration and 
recompile it. No changes to sysinit scripts are necessary. Additionaly, 
to mount sysfs during boot time, you must add the following line into 
your /etc/fstab:
     none   /sys   sysfs   defaults   0   0

Also, make sure that the procfs entry remains in your /etc/fstab.

  Compile in support for /proc filesystem also. It's under filesystems->
pseudo-filesystems. Here's my .config (warning: large number of lines),

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] free webspace for any CMS
Message-ID: <1093153496.19537.202800742@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello,

I am actually a part of a self-help group and we have decided to make a
website of our own and as all self-help groups, we are financially
somewhat weak.

So I need to
1. make a website and that too ASAP.
2. host the same for FREE.

Any pointers to a good CMS(i thought of using drupal) and more
important, a FREE webspace.

regards,
vijay.

Thank you Chander! Let me check my .config. I think I have not enabled 
/proc file system in kernel configuration.

Dear Chandrashekat,

Thanks for explaining the difference between proc and sysfs. I will 
compile with proc support and revert back

Hi

This site shows where we stand wrt others in gnome doc.

Are indian languages trans lagging or ahead of most.

Perhaps large english speaking population is reason.

No pun intended.

If you look [1] closely developer docs are fully translated and about
two-third of desktop docs are translated.

Very true. I wonder how many among us are really comfortable 
reading/typing/programming using our native language.  I guess native 
language support here has its own purpose (Desktop publishing comes to  
my mind).

But for general purpose computing, is it really worth the effort at all 
? I guess it would be a lot easier for people to learn english than 
expecting a revamp of all applications to understand their native 
language (atleast in India). 

I wonder what would the word 'Gnome' sound like if translated to tamil 
for instance :-P.

As a sidenote, our ability to communicate fluent english has been a plus 
point for our dominance in IT. 

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Hi

I was just wondering if all the computer revolution had been started 
here, what type of computer programming language would have evolved. 
Eventhough computer speaks only 0 and 1 imagine how assembly language 
would have evolved in hindi or tamil ....

What type of input device would have evolved ...

What type of computer mathametics would have evolved....

Boolean Algebra in written in hindi or tamil or ....

C, C+++ in native language

This is if the evolution has taken the same steps as what it had taken 
for us now. Otherwise it would be different.

I think its impossible for any indian languages to have invented 
computer revolution as its precedeed by electronics revolution again 
preceeded by theoritical physics etc...


Hmm.. Wild Imagination

  I prefer to compile in some critical stuff, including netfilter, SCSI,
ethernet drivers, some filesystems, crypto, etc. (both for performance
as well as enhanced immunity from rootkits that modify /lib/modules/...).

  Probably overlooked - I'm not currently using any USB or PCMCIA device.

  Some Ogle and Xine binaries which were precompiled and configured for
OSS - I'll eventually get around to rebuilding them for ALSA.

If the computer revolution had started in India at all, I guess we 
wouldn't have had such complex hardware interfaces and applications that 
abstract them like we see today.  In my opinion, our first successful 
application would be natural language processor for our native languages 
- A computer with just a talking device and a listening perhaps. One 
that understands the language we speak, and simply reply back in our 
native language. Most indian languages have a high degree of 
predictability in terms of grammar, syllable, flow and pronounciation, 
unlike the english language. If computers and programs evolved purely 
from India, they wouldn't have been as complex as they are today.

Imagine a computer without mouse, keyboard and monitor. A computer that 
simply communicates with us verbally, and listens to us. Life would've 
been a lot simpler.

But then, I wonder if we needed computers at all... Perhaps, we would've 
trained our "natural computer" (aka our own selves) to be more 
productive, efficient, less error-prone and *most important* - use our 
creativity and common sense (which the computers even today lack) like 
our predecessors (before 3000 years) did.

Dear Linuxians,

I have recompiled with /proc support and set right /etc/rc.sysinit and 
/etc/fstab as you said... ( as a newbie i am amazing with the .config 
file... it is really helpful to customize our own kernel.. what i have 
understood is right?)

At the stage of "make install" i am getting the following error message:
"No module /bin/true found for kernel 2.6.8.1"
and make install failured! As per my understanding /bin/true is a binary 
executable file which returns true while executed... it is not a 
module... then how come this message?

For your kind info: In the process of debugging this problem, i lost my 
/etc/modules.conf file. How to get it back or generate? :( :(

Please help me to track down the issue?

Regards
T.KaruppuSwamy

Did you upgrade modutils (and the other stuff required before you can 
upgrade from 2.4 to 2.6) first?

2.6.x uses /etc/modprobe.conf and this is generated by running

# /sbin/generate-modprobe.conf > /etc/modprobe.conf

If the computer revolution had started in India at all, I guess we
wouldn't have had such complex hardware interfaces and applications that
abstract them like we see today.  In my opinion, our first successful
application would be natural language processor for our native languages
- A computer with just a talking device and a listening perhaps. One
that understands the language we speak, and simply reply back in our
native language. Most indian languages have a high degree of
predictability in terms of grammar, syllable, flow and pronounciation,
unlike the english language. If computers and programs evolved purely
from India, they wouldn't have been as complex as they are today.

Imagine a computer without mouse, keyboard and monitor. A computer that
simply communicates with us verbally, and listens to us. Life would've
been a lot simpler.

But then, I wonder if we needed computers at all... Perhaps, we would've
trained our "natural computer" (aka our own selves) to be more
productive, efficient, less error-prone and *most important* - use our
creativity and common sense (which the computers even today lack) like
our predecessors (before 3000 years) did.

Another wild imagination ;-)

Chandrashekar Babu.

Its true. But then we have those capability still now. Only thing that 
"self" seems to be forgotton in the  new world order. Industrial and now 
Communication revolution has changed our life style. We no more depend 
on our "self" . We depend on our intellegence. And languages,culture, 
etc all depend on this intellegence and not "self" anymore.

Make sure that you dont share / and /usr and /var partitions.  [assuming 
that / partition hosts the directories /etc, /lib, /sbin directories]. 
Sharing the same users and groups could mean sharing a common /etc 
directory... which in my opinion can raise other complicated issues 
[imagine having to manage a common sysinit scripts for both your distros!].

There should not be any problem. I have done this sometime back.  I
shared the /home, /tmp and SWAP partitions. The data is
/etc/{passwd,shadow,group,gshadow} need to be in sync.

Hi,

    I am a "been there-done that" guy for you. Here are the steps that I
followed:

1) Install Win98 (A minimal installation would do)
2) Install Win2k in a separate drive.
3) Install RH9.0 after this (ofcourse on a separate Logical drive)
4) **************Do Not Overwrite Win98 **********************

you actually dont need to do that .. you can boot into your linux root 
partition from a cd if your master boot record gets overwritten after 
windows got installed

and for this guy - he's already got a working dual boot box and wants to 
boot into linux by default instead of windows

for that - edit /etc/lilo.conf (or /etc/grub.conf) and check the default 
boot there.

in lilo you'd just modify default=linux to default=winxp (assuming the 
two entries are labeled linux and winxp), then run lilo (/sbin/lilo -v)

in grub - the OS's to be booted are listed in order - 0,1,2,3 etc (0 is 
the first one is 0 and then on. Change the default=0 (or whatever) in 
there to the appropriate number for the windows partition. Once the 
grub.conf is modified you dont need to run anything, unlike in lilo

can the sysinit scripts be shared? why not , if it cant be shared, can
u pls tell me why, most of the scripts for sysinit are placed in /etc
so will sharing it be a problem? ( surely it wil be a problem) but i
went through the sysinit scripts, most of the references were to
standard binary files, but i'd like to share /etc and change it , will
it be a simple or complex task?

I think the poster's problem is that the system boots by default into
Linux and not windows. He should be tailoring lilo.conf or menu.lst as
the
case maybe depending on whether he is using Lilo or grub.

Would that mean booting with a CD always? I am not aware of this method.

boot in with a cd the first time. once you have booted in, run lilo or 
grub again

when you boot in with a redhat / slackware cd etc - you get a boot: 
prompt.  You can either hit enter to boot straight from the cd, or you 
can do this:

boot:  linux root=/dev/hda1 noinitrd ro

assuming the kernel on that redhat cd is called "linux" .. in slackware, 
it'd be called "bare.i" so you'd enter bare.i root= etc

that'll put the overwritten mbr back in place

alternatively, you could create a linux boot floppy using the boot 
images on the rh cd and the rawrite / rawritewin.exe tool and do this 
using the boot floppy

of course not !
As Srs neatly explained you would have to boot into your machine and
tailor the boot loader be it lilo or grub.
Subsequently install grub/lilo on the MBR by running grub-install /dev/hda
or /sbin/lilo and then when the machine boots
you would be presented with the loader.
The poster was saying that the default option was on windows.
SRs gave the method to change that option to Linux.
After the timeout exceeds it would boot into Linux by default

What are the advantages of such a method ?
===========================================
* you are working remotely and you might have to reboot the system from
the remote location several times, and if it is a dual boot system then it
has to boot into Linux. By ensuring that the default option is Linux, this
is possible.

As long as you know in detail what your sysinit scripts do and tweak 
them to suit your need to boot both Fedora, as well as Slackware. There 
are lots of other configuration files which are different in both these 
distros. For example, apache configuration files vary (Fedora uses 
Apache2, Slackware uses Apache 1.3.x). The default user/group scheme are 
different across these distributions. Some programs in Slackware behave 
a little differently than the similar counter-parts in Fedora.

Simply put, there's a lot of work involved in ironing out the oddities 
of both the distro, sharing the same config files. I guess the more 
effort you put into it... you will either end up converting slackware to 
resemble redhat, or vice-versa (sysinit, configuration, libraries, so 
on). You might end up losing the very essence of either distributions 
(system startup, default configuration, and so on).

But it can be fun way of learning how one distro is different from the 
other (as long as you dont end up losing valuable data).

Good luck with it :-)

Hi,
Sorry I didn't reply immediately. Thanks Mr.Chandrashekar. Whatever
you said 'nearly worked'. Taking your guidance, I typed root (hd0,6)
and mounted a FAT partition so I tried increasing 6 to 8 and landed in
my ext2fs partition.

I saw the /boot/grub/menu.lst file and 'cat'ed it and typed according
to updated partition
As:
root (hd0,8)
kernel (hd0,8)/boot/vmlinuz-2.6 root=/dev/hda9 devfs = mount
resume=/dev/hda10 vga=788
initrd (hd0,8)/boot/initrd.img
boot

It load the kernel with no prob. It also shows (press 'i' for
interactive startup, loads usb-uhci etc., etc., but when it comes to
mount the file system, it says that.
e2fsck found bad super block magic number (or something like that) and
it is checking /dev/hda8, whereas my ext2fs is in /dev/hda9. it asks
me for root password for repair console or press ctrl-D to continue.
It also said that if I try to repair I will damage my partition. I
understood that it has actually landed in wrong partition.
Now I understand that the e2fsck (the scandisk clone in Linux) does
actually check my /dev/hda8 whereas my system has ext2fs at /dev/hda9.
I guess that the location /dev/hda9 is hard coded in some file. I
should change it to /dev/hda9 (or make my sys understand that my
ext2fs is located in /dev/hda9 rather than /dev/hda8. Now how do I
modify so that when I boot the e2fsck stuff checks my /dev/hda9.
FYI, in the root recovery console, I did e2fsck on /dev/hda9 and found
it to do 3 passes and saying that my ext2fs is clean  and xxxx inodes
free etc., etc.,

Perhaps you must boot in rescue mode, mount /dev/hda9, and edit 
/etc/fstab of that partition. I guess the /etc/fstab has an entry that 
maps /dev/hda8 to / partition. You must change it to /dev/hda9.

Let me know if this was the case.

Right said! I got my motherboard fried last year due to lightning. The 
culprit obviously was the telephone line which was connected directly to 
my *cheap* internal modem.

I guess not. I've tried rummaging through IITM's FTP site, hoping to

*I think* can be used for network installs.

Go for an external modem. Depending on your budget, you can either buy 
from Dax, DLink or US Robotics. All of them are supported on Linux as 
far as I know.

Subject: [Ilugc] AC97 Line in recording...
Message-ID: <b0c7e4c60408232356610c780a@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a problem with recording sound from the line in port of my
system. I have connected my radio in line in and am able to control
the volume of the sounds using KMix (I use KDE with Xandros OCE). The
record source has been set to Line-in. But I'm not able to record the
sound. The arts sound controler volume level does not jump for line-in
sounds. It works for internal sound sources like xmms etc.

I've also tried aumix and sound-recorder (after killing artsd). They
just do not record a thing. As I am able to hear and control the
volume of my line-in input, the sound is received, but I do not know
how to dump it into a file. Does line in have a separate device (as
opposed to /dev/dsp) or someting? Or am I missing someting
fundamental?

Thanks and regards,
Shoban Jayaraj

You can use a BNC(bouncer) service or get a ssh tunnel to some outside host.
However I doubt if your proxy will allow that too. Normally except
http(filtered through a proxy) all others are likely to be blocked.

If I remember those RMS speeches correctly, 'g' is pronounced as 'g'
in the word 'good'

quite a few other irc admins do as well

and if irc is firewalled at your campus, dont use irc there

using it against campus policies just might get you into some trouble

Thanks for the reply.

	Can you please tell me the services that I can run/I should not
run. That is the grey area for me.

if its redhat,

1. get a recent version (fedora core say)

2. run up2date regularly

3. run a workstation install rather than a server install

Depends if it is a technically enforced rule or a written policy.
Typically one shouldn't care about a technically enforced rule(and its
sloppy implementation) but only a written down policy for resource usage.
By default for a user whatever doesn't violate a written down policy can be
done.

Subject: [Ilugc] installing wxWindows-2.4.2
Message-ID: <1093358247.3085.148.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi,
   I was trying to install wxWindows-2.4.2(so that i could use xchm)
after #make install, shows a message(after a set of output displays)
that i have to run ldconfig. When i did, it returned command not found.
Though man ldconfig does exists. Further it says to modify
LD_LIBRARY_PATH ( or equivalent) environment variable. How do i modify
it & what do i modify in it. Any help in this regard would b a great
welcome. i am currently using redhat 9 on a PIII processor.

Thank you,

As a rule, run only those services that you require to be running for 
your work. You might also want to run certain services *only* when 
required (xinetd comes to my mind, for example). Not only does this save 
memory and reduce the boot/shutdown time, but also makes your system a 
bit secure.

If you are technically inclined, CGI:IRC might help [search for "CGI 
IRC" on google to get a list of websites hosting them]. Its a web based 
IRC client hosted generally hosted by some websites to overcome the 
proxy/firewall issue.

But if your campus "disallows" irc access by their policy, you shouldn't 
be breaking that policy.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Seems to me, that you tried running 'ldconfig' as a normal user. If that 
was the case, you should be running it as '/sbin/ldconfig' (as /sbin is 
generally not in the default PATH for normal users). However, you are 
advised to run '/sbin/ldconfig' as root.

You can temporarily sort out this issue, by adding the path to your 
wxwindows library into your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. 
Assuming that the wxwindows library was installed in /usr/local/lib,
you might try 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/'  
at your bash prompt. I'm not sure if wxwindows creates a subdirectory 
under /usr/local/lib and stores its libraries in there. If that is the 
case, you must want to modify the path appropriately.

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Regarding the /dev/ttyx, you must've disable "Virtual Terminal Support" 
in your kernel configuration. Make sure that you have these entry under 
the character devices in your .config file (created in the 
/usr/src/linux/ directory):
 
  CONFIG_VT=y
  CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
  CONFIG_HW_CONSOLE=y

Optionally, you can set the option while running the 'make menuconfig' 
under the "Device Drivers"->"Character Devices"->"Virtual Terminal". 
Also enable "Support for console on virtual terminal" setting.

Regarding the /dev/fd0, you must enable "Normal floppy disk support" 
under "Device Drivers"->"Block devices" section (either as module, or as 
kernel builtin).

Let us know if this helped!

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

that it is getting a timeout on the select system call. I wonder
why they use select in rpm. But is this something to do with the

the original rh9 version of rpm is a problem... upgrade to the 4.2.x 
version of rpm - big pain in itself

then upgrade glibc (glibc-common, glibc-devel, glibc-utils). you may 
have to rpm -Uvh --force the install - maybe do a --force --nodeps as 
well - even bigger pain

follow the howto sivasankar chander posted in ilugc some days back about 
getting 2.6 to work on rh 7.3

I remember I did export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1 before doing any rpm
operations.

supports a wide variety of movie file formats (.dat,
.mov, .mpeg, .avi, ...).

IMO, mplayer should be the best choice. Visit,
http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design7/dload.html to download the
latest version. In order to play, you can either specify the filename or
the track no. See the man page for details.

Hello everybody out there using minix -
I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and
professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing
since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on
things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat
(same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)
among other things).
I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.
This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and
I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions
are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)
Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)
PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.
It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never
will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.

Did you actually mean scheduled automated "update" ? Or was it really a 
scheduled automated "install from the scratch" (as I might've 
misinterpreted) ?

For automated updates, you can use up2date on Redhat/Fedora. You can 
also schedule update on other Linux distros by setting up a cron job 
appropriately. Most  "enterprise-friendly" distros do have a tool 
similar to up2date.

If this is not what you want, I'm a bit curious to know the significance 
of the earlier mechanism :-)

Put ur gzipped or bzipped tar file in /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES directory. Create a spec file and place it in /usr/src/redhat/SPECS directory. From there u execute 
rpmbuild -ba <spec file name>.spec
After completion, u can get ur rpms and srpms from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS and /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS directories respectively. U can create ur own basic spec file easily, after having a look at "maximum-rpm", a book for rpm packagers. Include only the essential entries in the spec file. Its not needed that u shud include all available options.

  The patch utility does not create RPM files; it just makes changes
to your source tree based on the patchfile.

  RPM files are created using the rpm and rpmbuild family of
utilities. These perform their function under control of various
configuration files, and most importantly, a file called the 'specfile'
that controls how the source is rebuilt, installed, uninstalled, etc.

  Some Open-Source projects include a generic specfile that is usable
for creating an RPM for some common distributions (RedHat, Mandrake, SuSE,
etc.). To create an RPM from a tarball when the specfile is already in
the tarball, do:

rpmbuild -ta <package>.tar.gz

  If the specfile is not present in the tarball, the above step will
fail. You'll then need to write a specfile, details of which are
documented in the RPM-HOWTO.

  In some cases, you may have to modify the generic specfile to make
it function correctly for your distribution.

The following url explains how to automate linux installation process
for fedora, redhat 9 but then you need 2 systems from what I understood.

Consequently linux can not be booted using LILO but Windows boots normally.

Does this happen for all your C/C++ programs ? Did you check by 
compiling a simple hello.c and a hello.cpp program ?

This problem had occured to me a long time ago when I tried to compile a 
.cpp program (C++ extension that is) using the 'gcc' or 'cc' command. 
Compiling .cpp programs using 'g++' or 'c++' solved the issue.

Let me know if this helps...

Thank you,
That worked & i am now using the software. I tried running it as root &
it worked. Before i tried, open up terminal after logging-in as normal
user & do a su. It seems that doing a su != logging as root.

Just a note: Doing an 'su -' as normal user should be almost like 
logging in as root. Doing an 'su' alone will switch your privilege level 
to root, but wont run root's startup profile scripts (thus, PATH and 
various other root specific settings aren't updated).

if you have madrake cd then boot using that into rescue mode, and run lilo.
else
  if you have knoppix, boot into knoppix. 
  mount linux filesystem.
  chroot to it, and run lilo.
  reboot.

Hi,
It depends on what kind of usage you have.If you only need to share it for
browsing the net you can go with squid,also iptables[nat] is very easy to
config.

Squid is a better tool for sharing web (http/ftp) access.  Squid +
Squidguard will give you plenty of control - you can authenticate users,
monitor and filter web access to your hearts content.

Use iptables for other access - mail, ssh, etc.

Message-ID: <B99FECA7782B834AB0D4D5B18D89F5F00177A6A9@chn-gdy-msg.wipro.com>


Hi,

	I am new to shell programming.

	I am trying to find the length of all the lines in my code that
are more than 80 characters for some coding standards stuff. I felt that
awk would be the best to get the list in a separate output file and
analyse methods to correct it.

	My awk code was:
$ awk ' { if ( length($0) > 80 ) { printf $FILENAME, $NR, "\n"} } ' *.c
>>/tmp/code

	This cause the error:
fatal: not enough arguments to satisfy format string
	The "format string" is present in $0.

	I tried writing a shell script for that:

#!/bin/bash

for i in `/bin/ls *.c`; do
        awk ' { if ( length($0) > 80 ) { printf $FILENAME, $NR, "\n"} }
' $i >>/tmp/code
        echo
done

	But that also gives the same error.

	Please advise.

	Cheers,
	Karthick S.

Can you run '/sbin/lsmod' and find out if 'iptables_nat' is being listed 
? Does doing a '/sbin/modprobe iptables_nat' help otherwise ?

A correction... the module is 'iptable_nat' and _not_ 'iptables_nat' as 
I previously mentioned.

OK, just curious to ask.  Is it going to be nice to write applets in
python (or any scripting language).  Normal python apps are fine, but
an applet is supposed to be run throughout the user session and memory
could be wasted for even tiny (applets) apps.

Message-ID: <20040827033921.91632.qmail@web11401.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear Friends

I have 2 public ips for internet and i also configured
both ips using 2 eth device, both are working fine in
my fedora core2 system and i am used the following
command to redirect and share the net

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTIMG -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTIMG -o eth2 -j MASQUERADE

my problem:

when i use 'iptraf' to moniter the traffic i found all
the traffics/requests goes to eth2 and not to eth1 and
eth1 is free with no traffic.

I want to share the request/traffic with both the
cards or any alternet way please help me.

thanks in advance

A quick (though non-optimal solution to work-around this issue would be 
as described below:
 1. Create an ethernet bridge interface (say, br0) and assign an IP 
address for the same.
2. Add both eth1 and eth2 to the bridge
3. Set the default route to the bridge interface.

You might need to install 'bridge-utils' to manage ethernet bridges 
(available at http://bridge.sourceforge.net). There's a howto document 
available at http://bridge.sourceforge.net/howto.html - which might help 
you in configuration/commands.

Note: Above configuration should setup both your ethernet interfaces to 
the same IP address - thus allowing all requests/traffic to be shared. 

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Your default route must be pointing to eth1. Setup a multipath default route
and do not use equalise (packet based) for this will break your NAT. Since
you are using masquerade, I assume your Publix IPs are not static. In that
case, you will need to fire up the multipath commad in the interface up
script.

http://www.linmodems.org should be a starting point to get help/info. Be

Desktop or laptop, we could have the same problem. In desktops, you have the
luxury of sticking in cards which is not feasible in notebooks. If you are
just developing with a fixed set of interface devices which are available in
the laptop, both are identical. IMHO, desktops are more flexible for this
purpose. I know people who use notebooks for developemnt and a old desktop
like a PII/PIII for testing/ deployment where all cards are plugged in -
thus giving portability and ability to test well.

I dont think so. As long as the laptop supports linux well, there should 
be no issues.

The following links might help you in deciding the right laptop for your 
requirements on linux:
    http://www.linux-laptop.net/
    http://www.tuxmobil.org/mylaptops.html

Personally, I've been using a good old IBM Thinkpad for about 5 years 
now with Linux running on it.

still risky, with indian phone lines and indian power conditions.. 
lightning strikes / power surges could just fry your PC without any 
trouble this way.

just go shell out a few thousand rupees (i guess 3k..4k) for an external 
modem - that'll work without any problems, give you a better connect ...

Do you have an entry in /etc/hosts and/or DNS for the hostname of that

 ?Check your DNS server forward lookup file whether your host name(website name U are trying to host) is updated or not, also make sure you have specified valid dns server ip in /etc/resolv.conf.If you don't have previlage to update your dns server then update /etc/hosts file with the website name your are hosting along with the ip.Then check check whether iit is being resolved OR not properly using the command nslookup websitename.

Did you try booting from a bootable linux rescue CDROM (knoppix, for 
example), mount the linux partition and check if everything was okay ?

Subject: [Ilugc] Problem with DNS server configuration.
Message-ID: <20040827152218.64082.qmail@web50106.mail.yahoo.com>


Hello All!

I'm using RH 9. Today I configured my DNS server by editing /etc/named.conf file.

Then I created forward lookup zone file and reverse lookup zone file under /var/named as per RH doc.

If I start my DNS its working fine, no problem. But when I stop it it says " Stopping named service " but doesn't give [OK] message and comming back to prompt.

When I start the service again it says named service is already running.

If I put netstat -an|grep 53  after I issue service named stop its shows TIME_WAIT against port 53.

So If I do any changes in my configuration file i need to reboot the machine. ( I don't want to use reload command)

But once i restart my machine named service is running and serving the requests.

what will be the problem.

Plz help me.

Thanks

Vijay

If you had configured lvm while partitioning your hard disk,  the issue 
could've been sorted out in a simpler way.

Anyways, a crude way of solving this issue would be as below:
1. Run a 'du -sk /var/*' and make a note of directories which take up 
more space.

2. Make a recursive copy of those directories (use 'cp -a' to be safe) 
into a mouted partition with more space (for e.g. /usr).

3. Once you've confirmed that the files are safely copied (with 
attributes, permissions intact), delete the original directories (the 
ones in /var) that you copied. [You can directly use the 'mv' command 
and move those directories, but I would be a little hesitant to do such 
a thing on a live machine].

4. Create symbolic links from /var to the newly copied (or moved) 
directories ('ln -s').

[Boot from a linux rescue CD-ROM and mount these partitions in 
directories under /mnt or similar locations, to be more safe (to avoid 
problems with lock files). Change directory path indicated above 
appropriately.]

 From now on, files that get created in some directories of /var will be 
stored in /usr (or other partition where you linked the directories).

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

ok
even "service named reload" is working and serving with the changed information.
I'm not sure that i heared if we issue reload the service will not release memory, it'll just reread the data/conf file and this is not a nice practice.
plz correct me if I'm wrong.
 
thanks

hello,

I have small problem in dns 
before we got network 10.2.0.0/255.255.0.0
and the named.conf file is like this 
##############################################################
zone "fire.org" {
        type master;
        file "fire.org";
        allow-transfer { 10.2.1.32; 10.2.1.34; 10.2.1.35; };
};
zone "rrg.fire.org" {
        type master;
        file "rrg.fire.org";
        allow-transfer { 10.2.1.32; 10.2.1.34; 10.2.1.35; };
};
zone "2.10.in-addr.arpa" {
        type master;
        file "10.2.reverse";
        allow-transfer { 10.2.1.32; 10.2.1.34; 10.2.1.35; };
};
##################################################################
it is working fine with old network.
but now we have implemented vlan on network like,
vlan1 10.200.1.0
vlan2 10.201.1.0
vlan3 10.202.1.0
vlan3 10.2.1.0
now vlan3 ip's r working fine because they r in 10.2.1.0 network
but,i want to add some hosts which r on 10.200.1.0,10.201.1.0 network 
how ?

what changes should i do on my dns server so, that all my vlan's hosts
can resolve.

venu

    Steps taken by me:
    step 1:[upgrading kernel]
    This problem persists in both kernels-2.6.5-1.358 and 2.6.6-1.427.
    I have sent the /var/log/message in fedora core 2.
    step 2:[change modem init strings in kppp and wvdial]
    While searching i found that replacing correct modem init scripts 
rectifies the problem.
    I found the respective inf file in windows xp and copied the init 
strings.
    These are the modem init strings in my windows *.inf  file.I 
replaced the modem init string in /etc/wvdial.conf and ran wvdial as root.
    HKR,  Init,          1,, "AT<cr>"
    HKR,  Init,          2,, "AT&FE0V1S0=0&C1&D2+MR=2;+DR=1;+ER=1<cr>" 
    
    Even after changing the init strings the system connects at  9600 
bps.
    Console output is:
    [root@localhost ignacius]# wvdial Touchtel
    --> WvDial: Internet dialer version 1.53

    --> Waiting for carrier.
    +MCR: V90
    +MRR: 45333
    +ER: LAPM
    +DR: V42B I have already used the same modem with mandrake 10 and slackware 
for internet connection.
    There is a problem with my internet connection in fedora core 2.
    I have a windows XP and fedora core 2 dual boot PC.
    I use a 56kbps dax external modem.
    In windows XP it connect at 45333 bps.
    But,in fedora core 2 it connects at 9600 bps.
    I want to connect to internet using fedora core 2.
    I found lots of messages regarding this issue in the internet.
    I have given various log files information......

It seems to me that your video card is not well supported by Xandros. A 
temporary work-around would be to hold the shift key, as soon as you see 
the Xandros logo during bootup. You will provided with a series of 
choices for booting. Select "VESA Mode" in the menu of choices (using 
your arrow keys) and continue booting.

If it boots, expect a slow performance and occasional display corruption 
while using your desktop environment. If the problem still persists, 
then it might be due to some other hardware that Xandros failed while 
initializing.

In my experience, Xandros is tightly integrated with very little room 
for customizability (unlike other linux distros - 
SuSE/Mandrake/Knoppix). Trying to disable hardware probe (which can be a 
little difficult though), might result in boot failure.

This distro is well suited for absolute non-technical end-users who wish 
to migrate from Windows and own branded (familiar models) computers. But 
not recommended for experienced or even intermediate users who'll want 
flexibility or customizability. If it doesn't support your hardware, 
there's nothing much you could do about it (unless of course, you 
"bought" an Official copy of Xandros which carries a support license 
with it).

Cheers,
Chandrashekar Babu.

Try also adding the next init string that appears on the Windows log 
which you sent ("ATS7=60S30=0L1M0+ES=3,0,2;+DS=3;+IFC=2,2;BX4") and 
check if that helps.

echo "alias ipv6 off" >> /etc/modprobe.conf

opened Gedit as root and browse to /etc/modprobe.conf

added these two lines:

Message-ID: <FA3F4D4380B5D51186D600B0D0AAD2420A3BCB10@ccr.satyam.com>

Hi 

  I have 2 systems at home .. one a p3 700 mhz 512 mb ram working fine . and
the second one p2 

350 mhz 64 mb ram no HDD and monitor broken.

The second machine is almost unusable (since no HDD and monitor) .. I want
to make use of the processor thats is available in the second machine .

In other words I want machine 1 to be integerated with machine 2. which will
give me dual processor machine.

I cannot go for a cluster since I have no hardisk in the second machine.

Is it possible to somehow say to machine 1 that there is another processor
avilable in machine 2 which should be taken as integeral part of the system
.

Machine 1 -must assume machine 2's processor as its second  processor. is it
possible to achive this change thru some  kernel changes  or how do we go
abt such a thing ?

I am certain this must involve some hardware changes too.. 

Any cluues on how to go abt ....firstly is it possible .

I know this is somewhat weird thought ...and somewhat irrelevent to this
grp. 

any help will be greatly appreciated.

regards
kannan

The Answer your looking for:

OPEN MOSIX

www.openmosix.org

>From the Sourceforge page, here's an excerpt

What is openMosix?
openMosix is a Linux kernel extension for single-system image clustering.  This kernel extension turns a network of ordinary computers into a supercomputer for Linux applications.

Once you have installed openMosix, the nodes in the cluster start talking to one another and the cluster adapts itself to the workload. Processes originating from any one node, if that node is too busy compared to others, can migrate to any other node. openMosix continuously attempts to optimize the resource allocation.

We achieve this with a kernel patch for Linux, creating a reliable, fast and cost-efficient SSI clustering platform that is linearly scalable and adaptive. With openMosix' Auto Discovery, a new node can be added while the cluster is running and the cluster will automatically begin to use the new resources.

There is no need to program applications specifically for openMosix. Since all openMosix extensions are inside the kernel, every Linux application automatically and transparently benefits from the distributed computing concept of openMosix. The cluster behaves much as does a Symmetric Multi-Processor, but this solution scales to well over a thousand nodes which can themselves be SMPs.

The openMosix Community is very active, contributing add-on applications and sharing helpful information with all users.  The openMosix Add-Ons and Community page lists these shared applications.  And, it is all GPL'd.

TH

  If you get hold of a motherboard that is SMP-capable (examples
are the Intel 440FX/LX/BX and the Serverworks LE/HE), you can get another
PIII 700 and put together a dual-CPU SMP machine with two PIIIs. 

  The reason that this is not even worth the effort, is that a single
Tualatin Celeron 1.4 GHz can comfortably outperform this combination,
and only costs about Rs.2000 (CPU only).

  It isn't really worth trying to get any additional power out of what
you already have, since there are far cheaper single-processor alternatives
out there.

  If you want to go faster, an AMD Athlon 64/2800 is about 4 times as
fast and only costs about Rs.13k (Mobo + CPU). An AMD Opteron 240
dual-CPU configuration is only Rs.45k (motherboard + 2 CPUs) and is about
6 times as fast.

  Clustering - either Mosix or Beowulf, but in all cases a two-node cluster
is next to worthless because of communication overheads. The clustering
SW also has to be locally installed or remote-booted through the network.

  It can't be done except as outlined above.

  You can consider converting your old PII to a thin-client setup running
LTSP or VNC or something similar, but it will still require a monitor
and a working boot device (either Etherboot/PXE or a floppy drive).

  Economically, I'd suggest harvesting the old machine for parts and selling
what you don't need. Use the proceeds to get a faster CPU for your present
machine. A 1.1 GHz Coppermine Celeron is a direct replacement for a PIII 700,
and should give you a nice 40% speed boost for < Rs.3k. As an added bonus,
you can recover cash by selling the PIII 700 as well, which can sometimes
fetch more money than a Celeron 1.1 GHz.

I have doubts whether is this the maximum net speed possible in fedora?It is still somewhat slightly slower  when compared to XP...
If any of you have detailed idea,Please give me what are the configuration files used by kppp.
What are the changes I have to make based on the above given details[The details given are for GNOME menu-->Network device control].

Any body using redhat 9 or fedora core1 and dax 56k external modem--->
please send your /etc/wvdial.conf file and /etc/modprobe.conf and other configuration files and kppp values in a detailed manner.It will be of great help to me.

Message-ID: <1093763431.2120.9.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi,
   Before i switched over to linux(RH9) i was using windows 98SE. I find
that the that my internet connection is much slower than it was under
windows. I suspect it may b due to modem driver b'cos the modem driver's
name is generic modem. I think a driver designed for this modem could
deliver better performance. I am using a Rockwell 56Kbps(Data/fax/voice)
external modem. It would b helpfull if somebody could provide me with
suggestion on how go abt. or link to the driver.
Thank You,

With regards,
Ashwin

Dear All,

Some of you are already using Google Gmail (under beta testing).
Here is my first hand experience with it.

GMail Review

Ever since Google Gmail beta testing started, some of my friends got a
invitation and created their Gmail account. After using them for a
while, they inturn got invitation to invite other friends. Some of
them asked me whether I want one. I was keep on refusing since already
I have enough email accounts including my own personal email account
mks at mksarav dot org. However the curiosity to test Gmail features
was increasing day by day. Finally one day, suddenly I saw an
invitation waiting in my inbox sent by my B.Sc. classmate Durairaj who
is working for Cisco, Bangalore.

I accepted it and created an account-- mksarav at gmail dot com. As it
is with Google, Gmail user interface is also very simple. No popup ads
or anything like that during login till logout. After using it for 2
days I was quite impressed by its features especially key board
shortcut. I got a feeling like I am using PINE/Mutt as far as the
keyboard shortcut navigations are concerned. Because of it, the amount
of mails you can handle in a given amount of time is really high.

The user interface is based on Javascript with cookies enabled. As of
now, it will run on the following browsers:

Microsoft IE 5.5 and newer (Windows)
Netscape 7.1 and newer (Windows, Macintosh, Linux)
Mozilla 1.4 and newer (Windows, Macintosh, Linux)
Mozilla Firefox 0.8 and newer (Windows, Macintosh, Linux)
Safari 1.2.1 and newer (Macintosh)

However I tried it with only IE6.x and Mozilla 1.6. The UI is really
fast and I love the auto address completion from your contact list,
when you type email address in the {To, Cc, Bcc} fields. Atleast this
is the first time I am seeing such a feature in a web based email. So
just by touching a few key stroke, address is complete!

One of the important feature is "Conversation view". By default all
the emails are threaded and each conversation (thread) will look like
a deck of cards neatly arranged. I have used threading facility before
with many email clients. However, this is the first time I am seeing
such a wonderful interface. You will appreciate it if you use lot of
mailing lists.

And of course, it much spoken 1GB storage space must be known to
everyone by now.

There is no concept of "Folders" in Gmail (the same concept is also
there in Opera M2 mail client). Everything is stored under "All Mail"
including the sent mail. Whenever you want to retrieve a particular
mail, just type some keyword in the "Search Mail" box, voila -- your
mails are there! Whoever used Google there is no need to tell how
accurate it search results are, and especially in this case, the
search are limited to your mail box and hence more accurate results.

Instead of folders, Gmail uses a concept called "Label" (Opera M2
client calls it "View"). For e.g., I created several labels one for
each mailing list like -- slugnet, ilugc, linux-bangalore-programming,
etc., When you are reading any conversation from that mailing list,
just assign appropriate label to it by clicking a button. The entire
conversation will be marked with that label. Any new mails under the
same conversation will be automatically visible under that label. A
single conversation can be categorized under multiple label.

As of now, Gmail has some restrictions in what you can send/receive:

* The maximum size of the outgoing mail should be 10MB.

* For security reasons, any kind of executable files are not allowed
in the attachment. Meaning, .exe files are not allowed as attachment
even if it hides inside zip, tar.gz., tgz, .gz etc. In such a case,
the mail won't be sent or bounced to the sender. Since most of the
viruses spread as executable files, this measure will try to reduce
the spread of email viruses through Gmail.

One nice feature I liked is, when you send a mail to a mailing list,
usually you will also receive a copy of it. However in Gmail, you
won't receive it since it is already stored in "Sent Mail". It don't
want to clutter your mail box with multiple copies of the same mail.
If you are able to see your sent mail, then it is successfully
delivered to the mailing list. If not, obviously you will receive a
"Mail delivery notification for failed delivery". However, if you send
a mail for just yourself (i.e. you are the only recipient), then it
will be delivered.

Spam marking is there. It reminds me spam marking in Mozilla Thunderbird.
The feature I liked most is it keyboard shortcut like:

c for compose
/ for search
k move to new conversation
j move to older conversation
p move to previous message in a conversation
n move to next message in a conversation
o to open the message/conversation (from the index page)
u return to inbox or conversation list
r reply
a reply all
f forward
TAB+Enter to send the message
! mark a message as spam
and some more. For a detailed list check:
http://gmail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6594&topic=-1

You will really appreciate the power of keyboard shortcut once you
start using it.

It comes with a nice spell checker also.

Overall I am feeling like it is directly working on my desktop rather
than web based since it is so fast.

Gmail by default uses Unicode UTF-8 encoding and hence you can cut and
paste the UTF-8 encoded text. For e.g., to send UTF-8 encoded Tamil
text, I open notepad in WinXP and type in Tamil using "Tavultesoft
Keyman" keyboard driver (with Unicode Tamil keyboard matrix file with
"Anjal" Tamil input method) and just cut and paste.

Since Gmail is still doing a beta testing to improve the features and
fix any bugs, it is not open to the public yet. i.e. You can't go to
http://gmail.google.com and create a account for you. Only some body
who are already using Gmail can invite you to create an account. Based
on availability of new storage space and other resources, Gmail is
allotting few invitations (say 5) to the existing Gmail users so that
they can invite their friends who will be interested in beta testing.
If you ever get any invitation, by all means accept it, and enjoy the
great Gmail features.

It's annoying to disable 'Find as you type' feature in likes of
mozilla just because of this.

btw, if you have another gmail account, you could use it as online storage

Most issues with internet connectivity speed on Linux are due to improper 
configuration. On newer Redhat Linux (8.0/9.0/Fedora), the issue could be
a general performance decline due to the desktop bloat (Gnome does not 
perform well on machines with less than 256 MB RAM).

Technically speaking, external (serial port) modems do not require drivers 
for functioning. However, you might have to modify the AT command set (for 
modem initialization) to vendor settings.

You can check these commands from Windows (in Control 
panel->Modems->Properties), and copy the same in your linux ppp 
dialer configuration (wvdial.conf, or KPPP, etc).

The problem is clearly with the connect speed as above.  
Is this connect speed consistently the same ? (Try disconnecting
and reconnecting a couple of times and verify). What is the 
connect speed on your Windows box (available on your modem.log 
or a similar file perhaps) ?

s/use/abuse/ :)

Some korean  company used to  abuse Yahoo! Briefcase  without Yahoo!'s
permission. They sold a software that would let people upload software
on  the "web"  and to  have enough  briefcases in  their  hand. (since
by-passing the  'captcha' image based text entry  system was difficult
they employed cheap labour which would go create Yahoo!  users). Their
software in turn used these userIDs to login and upload files onto the
briefcase. It was only time Yahoo! found this out and blocked them.

Its only a matter  of time this gmail fs is also  going to get blocked
:)

Thanks my dear friends, for your support! I have successfully upgraded 
my kernel from 2.4.18.X to 2.6.8.1. it is working fine, i can feel some 
good improvement in speed also.. ( is it so, or is it to my blind 
eye?... :)  :) )

After long struggling as a newbie, At last i followed a simple method 
which made my job easy. i.e
1. copy the 2.4.18.X's .config file to 2.6.8.1's root directory (THIS 
STRATEGY HELPED ME TO SOLVE THE DEVICE DRIVER LOADING ISSUES FOR MOST OF 
THE HARDWARES - Here only I had got stuck up previously!!!!)
2. run "make menuconfig" on copied .config and add a additional features 
or missing features carefully.
3. Then "make bzImage; make modules; make modules_install; make install".
4. If you don't use grub,  make an entry for new kernel in 
/etc/lilo.conf and run "lilo"

Hope it may be useful for others also.

Thanks,

I doubt it, becuase Yahoo itself continues to bear with YahooPOPs!
(http://yahoopops.sourceforge.net/) which let's you *receive & send*
mails thru your regular mail client. It's effectively bypassing Yahoo's
advertising, ergo, Yahoo is losing atleast some amount of ad revenue.
But still, the project continues to thrive.

In the same way, Google is bearing with many apps like Gmail Notifier
extension for Firefox, and even recently released it's own version of
Gmail Notifier. Bottomline is that, they don't want to antagonize users
by disabling neat apps. You cand *depend* on M$ to do that, for sure ;)

as long as you dont put too much strain on their systems by popping your 
mail with yahoopops on a regular basis (over X pops in Y minutes type limit)

or else you run into a filter of the sort used to detect spam robots 
that try to automatically create yahoo or other webmail accts and then 
spam through them .. and yr account gets deactivated

This is a general problem which i also faced.
I feel it is not a driver issue, but the way the data is transferred to the browser under X.
In other words i feel it is an issue with the x server and client.

I felt that All GUI stuff including refreshing is slower in linux than in windows.

  I don't about RH 9, as I don't use it much. However, I've never had
a problem maxing out my DIAS connection on downloads on my RH7.3 system.
(And previously, I've used multi-Mbps broadband connections on RH73
notebooks with full bandwidth. Not to mention that I have no problems
maxxing out an 800 Mbps 4-port Tulip full-duplex fast Ethernet card
while doing LAN file transfers and the like). 

  56kbps is so slow that it looks like background noise to the networking
stack of the Linux kernel.

  The obvious things to look for are your modem initialization strings
that allow it to connect at maximum speed of your modem.

  This is nonsense, as anybody who uses Mozilla with kde/X can attest.

> I felt that All GUI stuff including refreshing is slower in linux than in windows.

  Again, nonsense. GUI performance is one of the areas where XFree86 was always
way ahead of the Windows world, on well-supported hardware.

 You must be using a graphics card without decent XAA support under X
(probably a no-name SiS card or similar from China). SiS and various other
Asian manufacturers don not release programming information for their
chips in a timely manner - so there aren't any good open-source drivers
for their cards. If you've got one of those, tough luck. You're probably
stuck using X on the raw framebuffer.

  I'd suggest upgrading to halfway decent hardware (ATI, Matrox, NVidia,
Intel i810, i815 or similar, from good hardware companies with a track record
of open-source driver support) with XAA support in X, and see it fly.  It's
much faster than IE/Windows on exactly the same hardware. Even a lowly
S3 Trio or an Alliance AT3D PCI card (both of which sold for
~$2 or Rs.90 retail at Fry's way back in 1998) had scorching performance even
on a lowly 486/Pentium classic running XFree86 3.3.6. OTOH, a crappy
SiS63xx might well be over 100 times slower, even on a P4 3.06 GHz. YMMV -
there's no substitute for using your brains and doing some research before
obtaining HW.

Nope. As I quoted before, it can be a configuration issue. Moreover, this 
issue could be more tied down to supposedly "user-friendly" distros like 
RH/Fedora on their default autodetected configuration. If your system is 
slow/irresponsive, here are some quick hints to speed up:
1. Disable all startup services that you dont require. If possible, tweak 
around and optimize.

2. Check if your X Window System is configured to use the correct display
drivers [there are chances that your X display driver is set to VESA 
Framebuffer, which will definitely make your GUI too slow]. Where possible,
install the vendor supplied drivers for your display (eg., Nvidia cards, ATI
cards).

3. If your system has less memory (< 256 MB), switch to lean desktop
environments like XFCE, WindowMaker, IceWM, Enlightenment, or any other
window manager + file-manager of your choice.

4. Try moving to lean browsers like Firefox or Opera (as opposed to Galeon, 
Mozilla, Netscape and so on... they seem to be too slow at times).

5. If you are looking for good performance (at the cost of having to get 
your hands more dirty with manual configuration stuff), try Slackware (okay, 
you can also try Debian or Gentoo).

<rant>
Personally, I found Linux way much faster (than Windows 9x/2000 atleast) on 
my good old Thinkpad (which has 32 MB RAM). I use Openbox+ROX+Opera on 
this box, and its highly usable for web browsing atleast. Windows 2000 wont
even bother to start on this machine ;-).

Subject: [Ilugc] Patch to allow postfix-1.1.12 to build cleanly with db4
Message-ID: <20040830061404.C72CB32BCD@whitebox.dias.ath.cx>

Hi folks,
         I'm including a small patch to allow building postfix-1.1.12
(the last postfix1 release) to build cleanly on distros with Berkeley
db4, including RH8, 9, FC1, FC2, etc. If anybody out there still uses
Postfix1, give it a whirl. I'm using it in conjuction with Cyrus-SASL
1.5.28. It will probably also work on other postfix-1.1.x releases,
maybe with a line number offset - YMMV. I used it to patch postfix-
1.1.12-5.src.rpm (Google for this one).

The main benefit of using Postfix1 is that there's a greater body of
knowledge of its quirks and oddities, so those who already have it
running well would prefer to continue using it. This patch allows that,
even on more recent distros.

Deepak dude,

No offense meant, but Suraj has a point. Why do you write/send so many
mails to the group ???

you have done the same thing in blug-tech also.
In either case joining a company is based on your discreet decision.
Dont you have a thought process of your own dude ? What might seem good to
me might not be very good for you.

Also refrain from revealing stats about your salary structure.
Since you are currently working in HP, I am sure there are people from hp
on this list who might have read your mail and would have probably raised
the red flag by now.

you ought to be more careful.
This is just an advice, take it or leave it.

Funny thing - I was rebuilding/reconfiguring Postfix on my system,
and for a while I thought I had somehow put in a mail-replicating
rule in its configuration file :-) (used to happen with sendmail and
its rewriting rules, but less likely in postfix). 

With this torrent of spam, I was pretty confused for a while. I
sure hope I haven't broken postfix with my tweaks :-).

Kernel upgradation is not necessary for this issue. 
My wild guess is that your ISP connect speeds 
drop down when you access from FC1 mostly by 
coincidence [or your bad luck perhaps ;-) ].

And I managed to get my new text-mode e-mail client (Cone) compiled and 
running today morning. For a while I wondered if my e-mail client by 
itself was buggy/badly-configured after seeing the flood!

hi guys,
   I work on fedora core 2. but i still dont know what makes it
special from other versions of GNU/Linux. I know that most of you
use different distros. Could you tell me the difference between each
distro i.e. the sysinit scripts, the tools that provides etc(specific diffs).
GNU/Linux is the same but may be we can have a conversation and decide
the best among them , not the best GNU/Linux but the best distribution.

  Pretty hilarious coincidence! I'm a CLI e-mail junkie myself (still
on elm), so could you summarize some of the features/benefits of cone

i was also thinking of starting a similar thread. so here it goes.
1. i am pretty much pissed with rh9 when it comes to installing
things. the dependancy chains get me into a crazy hell...(if there is
anything that would keep windows users,who are used to one click
install, from migrating; it might be this thing) but apart from that i
like the display ... the X looks very classic (though it takes very
large amount of mem .. abt 200~300mb mb i think) very rich. i donno
how to bring that kind of looks in debian.( i will have to work
towards it this weekend.)

2. apt in debian is a step forward. but it compromises on the hardware
end. snd card not working (still working on that problem)...not
detecting the smp, could n't find admin tools (have dwnloaded a couple
of debian books yesterday.. have to yet read them)...

3. was abt to try gentoo (courtesy sridhar). but saw that he switched
back to debian. so laying low on that idea for now.

there must be some better way to install/maintain the sytem hardware/software.
so what is it guys?

I landed up on Cone, on my quest to find a text-mode 'e-mail client' which 
can do the following:

1. Directly interact with my ISP's SMTP server (I can't burden my laptop 
with sendmail, exim, postfix, and so on).

2. Have inbuilt support for POP3/IMAP protocols (so I dont have to 
configure/run fetchmail) and built-in *sane* editor/composer.

3. Provide me a highly-usable interface, with least learning curve. I 
gave up on mutt for its complex configuration scheme, bizarre 
keyboard-shortcuts (of course, its configurable), and way too many features 
than I can handle, and a not-so-intuitive UI. I'm sure 'mutt-freaks' will 
want to flame me on this one ;-)

>From the usability point of view, cone's interface somewhat resembles pine, 
but it seems to be a superset of pine, in terms of features.

I hardly used elm, but I found it remind me of lynx web browser (I use 
'links' for web browsing).

I'm still figuring out certain things on Cone (need to find out how to 
configure threaded message display and so on).

In terms of resource usage, its a little bulky when compared to 
mutt/pine/elm (using up 4.9 MB on my box). But I guess its a compromise
for not having to run MTA and fetchmail on my machine.

You can check http://www.courier-mta.org/cone/index.html for more 
information and also downloads of cone.

Chandrashekar Babu.

So you neither  run fetchmail... how do you do  the filtering? I guess

Different linux distros are more like different flavors of pizza. Each 
flavor has it own set of ingredients to make it feel unique and taste 
unique, and also caters to a set of people. What can be "best" for me may 
not even please the rest others. Thats how distros are. Wider differences, 
wider reach.

  Apples and Oranges - there isn't anything special about any distro. 
It's just a matter of convenience, and there isn't a best distro that's
suitable for all people.

  Having said that, you can broadly divide distros into 2 main categories:
Source-based and Binary-based. Source-based distros (like Debian & Gentoo)
are more suitable for experienced Linux users who know what they're doing,
and binary-based distros (like Slackware, RedHat, Mandrake, Suse, etc.) are
more suitable for people who don't want to spend time rebuilding
stuff from scratch, and would rather install everything at one shot and
get on with it.

  Among the binary-based distros, you can divide them on the basis of the
kind of package-management system used (RPM or other). 

> GNU/Linux is the same but may be we can have a conversation and decide

  Well, as I said earlier, there isn't a single best distro. For me,
RedHat 7.3 has worked out very well as an excellent desktop as well as
server distro. With some difficulty, I've been able to keep it upgraded
and patched for a lot of the stuff (kernels, libraries, compilers, tools,
ABIs, APIs, apps, etc.) that were not even around when it first came out. 

  For most developers, RedHat 6.2 worked out even better with its bulletproof
glibc-2.1.3/egcs-1.1.2 combination.

  Both are rock stable, very versatile and quite fast, especially with
upgrades to more recent kernels. To me, the toolchain has to be
bulletproof (i.e. able to correctly build whatever is thrown at it without
patchwork on the tools themselves). That is not yet the case with the
bleeding-edge distros, since most of the gcc-3.x compilers still miscompile
a lot of existing code, including the 2.6.x kernel and some versions of
glibc.

My personal take is on Slackware though ;-). Its lean, higly configurable
and gets out of your way in handling configuration files, package management 
and so on. I've used debian before, but found slackware to be the right 
distro for me ;-). The best part of it - its been the same since the first 
time I tried it (since '96).

you have a symonds account right? so you can do something like this -

$ ssh -2 -L2525:localhost:25 suraj@puggy.symonds.net

in a separate terminal

Then in pine at least, point your smtp server to localhost:2525

In mutt, configure exim to use localhost:2525 as the smtp server (google 
for exim ssh tunnel and you'll find a howto with the appropriate config)

Oh! in your case, I guess you have not much of a choice. I heard there's 
'ssmtp' which is supposed to be a really light-weight MTA. But then I really 
dont know if it can cater to your needs. exim is a lean MTA in my opinion.

Yes, it does. Good for vi/emacs kinds :-)

There is a rudimentary inbuilt mail-filtering support, but am yet to figure 
out how to set it up properly. It seems to be configurable using the UI 
itself.

IMO gcc-3.x is a bloatware of a compiler suite. It took me around 16 hours 
to compile the 2.2.26 kernel on my Thinkpad (Pentium 133) using gcc-3.2.3. 
The same compiled within 5 hours while using gcc-2.96 - and I fail to 
understand an acceptable reason for this.

  Thanks - this could be a good alternative for my setup. Configuring
elm and fetchmail is very easy, but the MTA (postfix + cyrus-sasl in
my case) is always tricky. My setup is also a dyndns.org setup with
postfix, cyrus-sasl, ddclient on my desktop/server, which sits on
an internal LAN behind a separate, standalone linux NAT/firewall/router
that connects to the WAN. Any change in my WAN transport layer (such as
a shift to another ISP or DSL service) is isolated to the linux router.

  The original intent behind going with postfix was that I'd eventually
move the MTA portions into the firewall, leaving only the mail clients 
on the other machines. But that idea is faulty, since the firewall is always
on and susceptible to power surges and so on. So it can't run a full-
featured distro, but only a minimal read-only root distro. That rules out
postfix and just about any other MTA on the firewall.

Also, I can replicate a firewall easily (it's a minimal router distro),
but MTA bring-up is hairy - so it's better left on my main desktop/server
machine.

Cone promises to be a reasonable alternative to the difficulties of 
maintaining an MTA on the desktop machine, as this is a critical point
of failure.

it was a "demo" service from novell to promote their mailserver product 
- maybe they just shut it down, i have no idea

find other shell services like m-net.arbornet.org - they too offer tunnels

and it's not all that slow. you can set your mailserver to queue your

"shift deleted" ? Oops!

There's a really really vague chance that you can recover deleted 
files/directories on linux. You can try using 'debugfs' tool to try your 
luck. There's a really old howto 
(http://pobox.com/~aaronc/tech/e2-undel/howto.txt) that might be of help.

WARNING: Using these tools without knowing what you are doing, can 
lead to a totally broken filesystem, and an irrecoverable loss of data 
on your partitions.

I use Debian unstable and I am really comfortable with it. Here are a
few things I would like to share.

1. Software maintenance is done by apt. I neither use dselect nor
tasksel. These are the commands I usually use --- apt-cache search,
apt-get install, apt-get update, apt-get upgrade.

You need to know a few things for example, install the package
x-window-system to install X, install the package kde for KDE, etc.

2. Install the package discover and it takes care of all hardware. You
need to answer a few simple questions for writing your /etc/X11/XF86Config-4

3. Know that only one application can write to /dev/dsp. I use KDE all
the time so have apps (mplayer, xmms, xine, mpg123, ogg123, etc. Though
I use only mplayer) writing to artsd. Some apps don't know to write to
artsd, in such a case instruct artsd to relinquish control over /dev/dsp
in maybe 3 seconds (can be done in KDE control center).

4. If you think a package needs to be configured, run "dpkg-reconfigure
PACKAGE"

Seems a little excessive, so I suspect insufficient memory, with 
thrashing. I haven't actually tried gcc-3.2.3 extensively, but I can
state that the gcc-3.3.3 compiler seems to work better. It has
good forward & backward correctness (it can compile newer as well as
relatively older code), and in most cases generates more efficient code
than gcc-2.96-110 (or whatever came with RH7.3), with similar compile
times (important for stuff like glibc and XFree86). Most build breakages
have been syntax related, but the compiler has actually uncovered
semantic errors that escaped with warnings on gcc-2.96 (like the patch
for postfix1 I posted today). So I think it is a step forward, even if
it uses more resources and occasionally miscompiles code, including
the kernel. 

Compiling the 2.6.8.1 kernel with it was a breeze - it was really quick
on a PIII/1 GHz/256 MB (say about 15 minutes with about a couple of dozen
modules).

On a P133 Thinkpad (similar to one I've got), I'd recommend staying with
egcs-1.1.2, although it rules out building some newer packages.

Dear Group 

 As suggested in this post , I had installed openmosix in 2 machines.
Openmosix works really fine.

But I have one question here ..

We have  a small program to find largest prime ( No threading etc etc )
simple C program to find the largest prime (upto 18 digits). 

Now when I run this program the following are the results.

When  I start the program ( prime_linux) its starts running in any one of
the processors available utilizing 100% cpu. The second CPU is idle. 

When I start a second instance of the same program (prime_linux) when the
first one is still running the program starts running in the cpu that's
idle. 

Now My question is 

When I run only one instance of my program How do I make  it run in both the
CPU's. 


Running in all the available CPU is what is desirable. 

Lets consider this scenario 

 Assume we run SAP on a Linux (p4 3.4 GHz 2 2GB Ram) Lets say a BOM process
runs for X hours . Now I upgrade it to a dual CPU machine will it still run
for X hr or X/2 hrs ???

Am I missing some configuration on openmosix ???

The Answer your looking for:

OPEN MOSIX

www.openmosix.org

>From the Sourceforge page, here's an excerpt

What is openMosix?
openMosix is a Linux kernel extension for single-system image clustering.
This kernel extension turns a network of ordinary computers into a
supercomputer for Linux applications.

Once you have installed openMosix, the nodes in the cluster start talking to
one another and the cluster adapts itself to the workload. Processes
originating from any one node, if that node is too busy compared to others,
can migrate to any other node. openMosix continuously attempts to optimize
the resource allocation.

We achieve this with a kernel patch for Linux, creating a reliable, fast and
cost-efficient SSI clustering platform that is linearly scalable and
adaptive. With openMosix' Auto Discovery, a new node can be added while the
cluster is running and the cluster will automatically begin to use the new
resources.

There is no need to program applications specifically for openMosix. Since
all openMosix extensions are inside the kernel, every Linux application
automatically and transparently benefits from the distributed computing
concept of openMosix. The cluster behaves much as does a Symmetric
Multi-Processor, but this solution scales to well over a thousand nodes
which can themselves be SMPs.

The openMosix Community is very active, contributing add-on applications and
sharing helpful information with all users.  The openMosix Add-Ons and
Community page lists these shared applications.  And, it is all GPL'd.

TH

  There isn't any magic bullet to take a single thread of control in an
imperative programming language (like any common programming language
in widespread use - C, C++, Java, Pascal, VB ...)  and split it
into two threads of control automatically. It just isn't possible - basic
introduction to computers CS 001 (See footnote below).

 You'll have to program your
code as two threads using pthreads or fork(). Mosix will be able to move
your processes across CPUs, but I'm not sure about threads - they're 
probably bound to the CPU that runs the parent process.

 Also remember that there's a huge cost to moving an entire process
context from one system to another over the network.

  If it's programmed as a single-process application, X hours + some overhead
for the SMP synchronization (say 1.1 X hours).

  If it's programmed as a dual-process application with perfect
synchronization, zero communication between processes, and perfect 
parallelization, about 0.5 X hours. In the real world, this isn't possible,
so you can expect anywhere between 0.5 X to 1000 X (the 1000 X comes from
pathological cases where one processor is practically idle,  waiting for
a result from the 2nd processor; the process is blocked and it's paged
out, until it gets a little piece of data from the 2nd processor and then
gets paged in for another small bit of computation before getting
blocked again, and so on. The costs of page faults, context switches, etc.
in these cases are huge).

  The short answer is that it depends on the nature of the computation
and the skill of the programmer. There are computations that are
intrinsically serial, i.e. cannot be parallelized at all, and there are
some algorithms that can be perfectly parallelized. 

Regardless of all this, Mosix, Beowulf or any other tool for that 
matter, can't do any magic that turns a
single-threaded application into a multithreaded one.

Footnote: 

However, there is an entirely different style of programming, called
Declarative programming, with functional-programming languages like FP, ML,
Prolog, pure LISP (not common LISP), where there is no abstract concept of a
thread of control. These can indeed be automatically parallelized.

The most widely-used declarative programming language is a hardware
simulation language called Verilog. Verilog simulation models can be
indeed be automatically parallelized, and there are numerous companies
that sell special systems that do just this (Ikos, Cadence/Quickturn,
Aptix/Mentor Graphics, etc.), in some cases with over a billion-times
speed-up over the software simulation.

  No, you don't get it - your systems aren't outdated until they're
no longer able to perform the task they're doing now.

  The issue of hooking up CPUs for getting additional processing
power, even from a purely academic perspective, is critically dependent
on the task which is sought to be performed, and is completely unrelated
to whether your system is outdated or not. Ceteris Paribus, a uniprocessor
solution is the only general-purpose solution that can run all applications
about equally well.

  There isn't any magic bullet that will generate parallelism where
none exists - this is the same blunder that caused CDAC to waste thousands
of crores of public money on a dead-end line of research into MPPs
over the last 15 years.

This is where lam and mpi can help you  out.
LAM-MPI is Local Area Multicomputer, Message passing Interface.

check out www.lam-mpi.org
has the tutorial on how to setup and some sample code.

A brief explanation:

Say I have 2 nodes. node1 and node2.
My MPI-C Program is programmed in such a way that primes between 1 to 100 are calculated on node1 and primes between 100 to 200 are calculated on node 2.
both the results are then sent to node1.

MPI Programming is very simple and one can easily MPI-ize their existing C programs.
Good Code Reuseability.

Also another option is MPICH which enable you to also use Windows based machines in your cluster.

Another option is JAVA-RMI, a java implementation of mpi in java does exist.try google/linux

NOTE:: The above mentioned are for a Beowulf Cluster and I'm not sure if a MOSIX enabled system can successfully implement LAM-MPI.

  On a single system-image platform (like most SMP machines or NUMA
machines like the SGI Altix), I see no difficulty in migrating
threads (userland or kernel) across processors. That's because the
process context resides in memory and is equally accessible to any
thread regardless of the CPU it's running on.

  However, on a cluster like Beowulf or Mosix, the entire process
context has to be replicated in each node running a thread from this
process, and all copies have to be kept in synchronization over the
network (there is no shared memory). This is bound to be so expensive as
to make it completely impractical to migrate threads alone. A single
process context can be a multi-megabyte image.

  It's possible to create a shared memory abstraction that uses underlying
network primitives to maintain synchronization, but it's only an simulation.
The actual implementation will be about seven orders of magnitude slower
as compared to a real shared-memory SMP machine.

  In simpler terms, Beowulf clusters don't share memory physically across
nodes, but the effect can be simulated at great cost in CPU cycles.

There is no best distro. Choice of distro is a

This is getting a lot of press over the last couple of days:

http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=18160

IMHO, Beowulf and Mosix clusters are nowhere near as versatile as big-iron
SMP or NUMA machines like the SGI Altix. However, announcements
like these bring a lot of attention to the capabilities of Linux and
help dispel the myth that it is a hobbyist operating system, so it's
good for us.

(12 x Transmeta 1 GHz CPUs in a pizza-box for $10k sounds attractive,
until you realize that you can get a dual Opteron 240 + Tyan Tiger
for $1k that's going to blow away the Orion on any large-dataset
problem that's not parallelizable, i.e. about 99% of the engineering/
scientific applications available. And the Opteron is 64-bit and
I can buy it in Ritchie St.)

Dear Friends,

sometimes before, i heard about MA620 (or compatbile ES620) IrDA adapter 
not working or not able to be configured...  I am able to do it with new 
kernel 2.6.8.1. I just want to share with you for our update.

1. Kernel is 2.6.8.1, which is having support for MA600, but it works 
fine for MA620/ES620 also.

2. Ensure that the following modules available and loaded.
    a. uhci_hcd
    b. ircomm-tty
    c. pl2303
    d. ma600-sir
    e. irda
    f. irtty-sir

3. make as script called IrDA_Start.sh with the following content:

#!/bin/sh
#
# Minimal stuff required to get the MA620 USB IrDA dongle recognised by
# the kernel.  Version 1 -- works with unpatched kernel, but only at
# 9600bps.

modprobe uhci_hcd
modprobe pl2303
modprobe irda
**echo 9600 > /proc/sys/net/irda/max_baud_rate
modprobe irtty-sir
modprobe ma600-sir
modprobe ircomm-tty
irattach /dev/usb/ttyUSB0 -d ma600 -s

exit 0

4. I tested it with my Nokia 6610. It works fine. irdadump confirmed it. 
Since I don't have GPRS I can dial into internet but not able to 
connect. That is fine.

5. I used "Kandy phone manager" tool availale in my KDE desktop, which 
works fine with this IrDA, except a few unsupported commands.

Just curious to know, how reliable is Linux on Opteron ? Does the kernel 
and compilers/applications efficiently implement/use the 64-bit 
instruction-set ?

Anyone around that run Linux on Opteron, and provide a crude 
comparative bechmark about its performance ?

HI

My friend is having a P III system, windows 98 and Win

installed 40GB (C: 10, D:10, E: 20 GB). In the 20 GB
FAT partition he is 
having some valuable data. To install MDK 10, he wants
to divide the 
existing 20 GB into two 10 GB partitions without
destroying exisiting data, 
which occupies only 5 GB. I am not familiar with
partition magic. Is there 
any free utility available to shrink and create
partition without destroying 
data?

Thanks

Some time ago, I saw a demo of a similar box containing 8 Celeron nodes
interconnected with 1G ethernet all running customised redhat.  All
except the master node were diskless and it had some slick software that
booted and managed the diskless nodes - you could power on/off the nodes
on demand from software, etc.  Would be interesting to see what the
Orion contains.

I can't believe they chose Transmeta for a HPC box.  Transmeta CPUs have
a history sacrificing performance for low power consumption.  The VIA
C3s would have been a better option.  Or wait until the desktop versions
of the Pentium-M is launched next quarter.

Ah! The joys of purchasing commodity hardware :-)

Just want to add that the Tyan Tiger is an exceptionally good product
line.  Starting with the dual AMD MP systems 2 years ago, Tiger has
offered server class features (64bit pci, ECC RAM, dual CPU, dual
onboard ethernet, etc) at affordable prices.  Perfect combination for
AMD and an excellent alternative to Xeon + Serverworks.

Nice article, thanks for posting.

FIPS 2.0 (http://www.igd.fhg.de/~aschaefe/fips/) should help.
There's also GNU Parted (http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/parted.html) to 
do this. 

NOTE: None of these tools are *guaranteed* against data loss. 
However, I've used FIPS before without losing any data.

To be a little safe, defragment your FAT partition (using Windows

I am on this connection for almost a week now and have all thumb ups.
The speed varies typically from 6KBPS to a max of 14 KBPS (sometimes)
; ofcourse depending upon the time and site you are accessing).

But overall it seems to be a  good deal.

(Sigh!. But for the same price I used to get 3MBPS in US. It changed
my habits: I never stored anything on HDD anymore. A full install of
debian over network would be over in max of 5 hours. May be it will be
a couple of more years till we get there.)

 The old VA Linux boxes were along similar lines - now they've moved on

  I agree completely - they could have gone with the Athlon 64 mobiles, or
the Banias, Dothan, Via C3 or PIII mobiles. Transmeta, however, has
an on-chip Northbridge (with Hypertransport on the Efficeon) and very low
power consumption, so it's easier to integrate 12 CPUs on a single board.
Just an engineering tradeoff, but bad from a performance standpoint.
Also the fact that the Orion founder (Colin Hunter) was also a co-founder of
Transmeta seems to have played a role.

  I'd have to agree again, but I haven't played with the Opteron boards.
If somebody has got x86-64 linux running on them with a usable distro,
could they please post their experiences?

  I haven't used it, but here is a link to the single-processor
benchmarks of the Opteron 150 vs. Intel Xeon 3.6 GHz (Nocona),
both running a 64-bit kernel:

http://www.anandtech.com/linux/showdoc.aspx?i=2163

(This was in response to complaints about their earlier benchmarks that
had compared a Xeon to a less-expensive Athlon 64, instead of the
Opteron, and concluded that the Xeon was better).

1) The entry for /dev/hda2 is missing in /dev. You can
recreate it (as root) with:

mknod /dev/hda2 b 3 2
chgrp disk /dev/hda2

     *or*

2) There isn't a 2nd entry containing a valid partition
in the partition table for /dev/hda. You can create it using
fdisk /dev/hda.

Can you run 'fdisk -l /dev/hda' and check if /dev/hda2 is being listed as a 
FAT/VFAT filesystem ?

I'm guessing that dump2fs (an ext2 fs tool?) destroyed critical
metadata on the windows partitions. Were they NTFS partitions?

If you have some idea of what kind of filesystem (fat16, fat32 or ntfs)
was on the affected partitions, and know their extents (size, start and
end cylinder), there is a fair chance that a windows-based data recovery
tool may be of some help. Your best chances are with FAT16 & FAT32
filesystems.

I could boot with linux, and ran "sfdisk -L" . It should me : /dev/hda1, /dev/hda2/ and /dev/hda5 as system ID of file system as "No File System"  

How ever other /dev/hda3 shown as "Windows fat32"

whent I tried "mount -t vfat /dev/hda2 /mnt/Windows" ..It showed 
mount: /dev/hda2 is not a valid block device

1) The entry for /dev/hda2 is missing in /dev. You can
recreate it (as root) with:

mknod /dev/hda2 b 3 2
chgrp disk /dev/hda2

     *or*

2) There isn't a 2nd entry containing a valid partition
in the partition table for /dev/hda. You can create it using
fdisk /dev/hda.

I guess they are not NTFS partitions..

well, the files system showing as fat16, fat12 on "sfdisk -L" on drive hda3
 and hda4 .. while other showing "No file system"

Also , I am able to see all /dev/hda1 to /dev/hda5 extends(size, start and end cylider)

can you suggest any windows-based data recovery tool..?

-Thanks for mail

I'm guessing that dump2fs (an ext2 fs tool?) destroyed critical
metadata on the windows partitions. Were they NTFS partitions?

If you have some idea of what kind of filesystem (fat16, fat32 or ntfs)
was on the affected partitions, and know their extents (size, start and
end cylinder), there is a fair chance that a windows-based data recovery
tool may be of some help. Your best chances are with FAT16 & FAT32
filesystems.
