http://linuxzoo.net/ offers free linux system administration courses
and boxes with root access to virtual machines.  Has anyone tried
this yet?

Looks like an easy way for inspiring system administrators to get
started on linux.

Message-ID: <44CEDE9A.8060907@midascomm.com>


Hi,

I have a problem with compiling a module for 2.6 kernel. I did a simple 
hello world module, compiled it and did an insmod, it is giving me an 
error "No Module Object found" in dmesg.
previously i have compiled and installed a separate kernel (2.6.13.2) 
for this. I compiled the module with the following options

-g -Wall -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE -I/lib/modules/2.6.13.2/build/include -c .

i understand that this is an version dependency, but unable to find a 
way to solve it.
am i missing something in the compilation or anywhere. could someone 
help me out?

He's asking about network security - and while crypto is a useful thing 
to know in that field, it is not the only thing around.

Read through the linux network administrators guide (NAG) - its 
available online, as well as published by o'reilly.

That will do for a start .. and there are other resources you can read 
once you have the basics in place.

It is a card that was bought from HP. It has a The Intel 82546EB Dual
Port Gigabit Ethernet Controller.

If the recv has an issue., then even the ping replies from the
cisco-router should get screwed. However., that does not happen.
Everything seems fine till the router. We are able to ping every other
NIC that is connected to the same switch.

However., I'm still waiting for the issue to occur so that I can grab a
tcpdump and see what is happening.

Yeah. I'm not in the campus right now., so i'm talking with the admins
there to start tcpdump to log interesting traffic till the issue occurs.

The NIC is a HP card having a The Intel 82546EB Dual Port Gigabit

The entire local network is behind the proxy-server shown in the diagram
(check http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/pipermail/ilugc/2006-July/027566.html).
The proxy-server has a Squid running on it for HTTP traffic., and is the
NAT gateway for SMTP, POP3, NNTP, XMPP and IRC. No local traffic comes
beyond the proxy-server.

Schneier and a few other things would sidetrack you into going too deep 
into crypto.

Start with basic concepts such as those described in sag / nag for good 
systems and network design and security

layer crypto on top of that .. you'll pick up a working knowledge as you 
go along, without having to go as deep into crypto theory initially

in fact picking up schneier without having a good, solid foundation in 
systems and network admin, design etc is not a productive thing to do

Similarly, atoms are the least common denominator for everything

Do you start to learn nuclear physics before learning basic science and 
conventional physics?

Agree but dont' stop with sag/nag. Internet is
overflowing with various other info on crypto. Basics
like SSL,encryption,authentication concepts can be
learnt from many websites. Netscape for SSL, and of
course RFCs.

Also Shneier is inaccessible and expensive. I read it
only after a couple of years exp with crypto.

HTH.

Best,
Girish

That is not how you compile a 2.6 Linux driver module.


Please try my simple 2.6 device driver examples:

4. Do not top-post:

Link: http://www.caliburn.nl/topposting.html

Example of a top-post:

   Because it messes up the order in which 
   people normally read text.

Always use bottom-posting.

> What is your name ?
  My name is ILUGC.

5. Do not over-quote:

Ubuntu Dapper supports sun sparc architecture (64bit?) and Intel
Itanium processors (64bit?). I'm unsure if intel core duo 2.8 ghz
processors are 64bit processors. But, i suggest you to try the
installation and see if it really works!!

First, please quote only the required text, don't quote the entire 
thread. Also, use a meaningful subject when you mail something from digest.

Second, the thread shows a GLV going on at ELCOT for the past two weeks. 
All are welcome to attend.

Third, If you are studying in a school/college who do't you try to 
organize a FLOSS Introduction Seminar in your college. If you are in any 
of the following colleges, something is happening there already which 
you might not be aware: Jaya engineering college, MNM Jain EC, Jerusalem 
  Engg College.

Fourth, If you keep track of the mailing list you can know everything 
which is happening around ilugc.

If you are doing it for a career you're probably out of luck, especially 
if you fall for some of the "ethical hacking" courses setup by ankit 
fadia and other such fellows .. you can see big advertisements for 
so-called "ethical hacking" courses, dont touch those.

Sure. I had given a talk on IPsec at IIT in March. You
should find the slides on the LUG website. 

I have hands on experience in various aspects of
crypto  but I need to know what topics you are
interested in.

Please collect your thoughts and needs. Whether you
want to do it offlist or otherwise you decide. We also
have to make sure people are really interested.

At least from whatever response I got from IPsec talk
I think people do have interest but it will help me
and you both immensely if you can tell me what topics
are of immediate interest and relevace.

I will get you started by whatever little I can do.

*) Intro to security ( symmetric and asymmetric
crypto, RSA, AES, DH, Blowfish, DES , hashing and
message digests(MD5, SHA*),HMAC, signatures,
authentication etc..)

*) Security protocols(SSL/TLS,IPsec, ssh, VPNs, MPLS,
auth protocols like challenge response, single sign
on)

*) Security toolkits (OpenSSL, kernel crypto, hardware
acceleration) 

*) Security programming (buffer overflows, key
management strategies,password hashing,storage, vm
encryption, cryptographic file systems)

*) PKI (X.509 certificates, web of trust, OCSP, CA,
CRL etc...)

*) Firewalls and spam control ( stateful and stateless
firewalls, TCP scrubbing, port forwarding, reverse
NAT, binat, TCP proxy) and spamassasin, mime-defrag,
vipul's razor ( I have no clue about commercial
alternatives)

*) Security power tools like nmap, nessus, nc

*) Career prospects for security 

Kindly select a subset from the above that is of
interest to maximum number of people. 

Please respond fast or else the interest will get
whittled away. 

We will fix up a date that is convenient for everyone
and proceed. 

What say? :-)

Looking fwd to meeting you all soon. :-)

Best,
Girish

Are you talking about Itanium or Core Duo. Core Duo/Core 2 Duo is not 64-bit.
Not sure if ubuntu has a IA64 port (itanium), they have on for the AMD
64-bit(x86-64) proc's.

Debian has both IA64 and x86-64.

All Core 2 processors are x86-64 capable (or EM64T in Intel parlance).
The debian amd64 port should work without any major issues.

Yes. Core 2 Duo is a EM64T CPU. Core Duo however is not. I stand corrected.

this happens all the time on this list as it is set as reply to  
sender. Unless one remembers to click reply all, the thread goes  
private. Incidently, as far as i know this the only lug list i belong  
to that does this. Result is 90% of interaction goes on offlist -   
and the community loses

Kindly get back to me with a subset of the topics I
mentioned. I know it is very hard to take a democratic
decision here. And I have no idea how these things are
done in LUG. 

Last time Bharathi suggested the IPsec topic. This
time  I gave you a list from which you can choose
based on your needs. I thought this will better serve
your need.

But I really want to know how many people are
interested.

Until now only two people have got back. 

What is the standard procedure and the LUG way of
doing this? 

Kindly educate me. Once we zero in on the topics we
can meet on any convenient day. IIRC Saturday is
convenient for most folks.

Thanks,
Girish

Guys, 

I love to see your interest. But pls pls understand
that it is not humanly possible to cover all of topics
at one stroke. 

Shall I start with the basics and some practical
OpenSSL demo? That will get you started. 

Then much later maybe we can meet again and take it
forward. 

What do others feel?

Welcome your comments.

start talking - and assume a basal level of zero among your audience if 
you need to.  and you can scale up or down from that as you need.

cover the basics first - good systems and network design, and then 
include where you can bring encryption in, to secure the transaction 
further (https, starttls etc for common traffic like http and smtp, to 
start with, ipsec, tunnels, vpns etc for regular traffic ..)

Thanks a lot Suresh. Suresh, can you tell me something
more about
1) good network design
2) corporate VPN use ( I know only VPN theory)

Or do you want to join me in the talk? I am somewhat
weak in those topics. It will be great if both of us
share a two hour slot. 

Do you have the time?

My strong point is OpenSSL.

I shall wait for exatly two days for responses from
people. You are free to stretch these topics anyway
you want. 

Then we shall arrive at a date , time, venue and I
will send you the slides( I will try at least :-) one
week in advance. 

After you get the slides also you can ask for changes.


But I would stick to the general outline suggested by
Suresh. 

Hope it is fine with everyone. Yes, I will certainly
touch upon career prospects. :-)

Bye,
Girish

well - you'd talk about concepts like a bastion host, dmz, etc.

This is a firewall vendor (netscreen)'s whitepaper but does spell out a few
of the concepts in quite clear language. Dates back to 2001 but still ok
http://www.defconpics.org/other/Principles%20of%20Secure%20Network%20Design.pdf

Some cisco press books like this one -
network security basics
http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=170742

and this -
general design considerations for secure networks
http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=174313&rl=1

are also worth a read.

The linux NAG has quite a lot of decent resources in it. 

But by far the best book on this that I know of is "The Practice of System
and Network Administration" by Limoncelli and Hogan
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=tomontime-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%3Fsearch-type=ss%26index=books%26keyword=0201702711>

That amazon link is from http://www.everythingsysadmin.com - the authors'
website, and so I guess the authors get a commission if you buy that from
amazon.  Everythingsysadmin.com has some great articles in it, worth a read

Thanks Suresh. But this much is very clear that there
is no way I am going to be able to talk about these
things just by "bookish" knowledge even if I do find
time to read whatever you sent. 

So whichever weekend you are free we can meet. No
issues. 

Here is a first cut "syllabus" for the talk. Please do
let me know if you find that ok. I am also zero in
spam and it will be wonderful to learn that as well.
Especially Bayesian filtering and stuff. :-)

Security 101

1) What is authentication? 
2) Difference between Symmetric and Asymmetric crypto
3) Threat model and various types of attacks
4) What is RSA? DH? AES? 3DES? Anatomy of ciphering
5) Security on the Internet (securing protocols like
DNS, SMTP, SNMP, HTTP, FTP etc.)
6) Security protocols like SSL,ssh, IPsec

Network Security architecture and design

1) Threat model
2) DMZ, firewalls, proxies
3) Worms, Denial of service attacks on the routers and
TCP/IP infrastructure, discussion about the "Iloveu"
worm(virus?) and few other recent attacks and how you
patched the vulnerabilities
4) VPN design and considerations- implications on
networking, tunneling etc.
5) Spam control theory, architecture of participating
peers and real world examples from Vipul's razor ,
Spamassassin etc...

How you can get started onto the security bandwagon

1) Learn how to use the OpenSSL tool
2) I will demo simple usages of the tool
3) Used for encryption, signing, hashing, keypair
generation, random number generation etc...

Security as a career

1) Where to start and what does the market need?
2) Why security programming will make you a sound
programmer?
3) Need to understand networking very well to
implement security protocols
4) Huge demand for *good* security engineers in the
market. PKI,VPN, networking and crypto knowledge: how
to develop them?

Suresh,

I think I will spend the first 40 minutes intro. Then
you can take over and talk for about 50 minutes. Then
I will demo OpenSSL toolkit and finally wind up with a
light discussion on career options which you should
help me of course. 

Friends,

Have I captured everyone's need? Did I miss anything?

Suresh,

Let us first prepare the slides and send them. That
way at least I will get some time to prepare and ppl
can come knowing what to expect and possibly also come
prepared as security waters are very deep...

My suggestion is let us prepare the slides offlist and
send it as one pdf. 

Bharathi,

Could you arrange sometime this month or at most early
next month when Suresh is free so we can meet? 

Thanks. 

warm regards,
Girish

god, you got the materials for a full 3 day workshop there

no way youre going to cover all this in a 2 hr glv session

probably compress it all into a weekend, morning to evening sessions

do it "at cost" as in people attending it pay a sum thats calculated to 
cover lunch / tea and hall rent if that becomes necessary.  [or at least 
pay for lunch / tea - if they do this in the IIT campus or somewhere 
like that there's no food for miles around]

No I am only going to give intro. I have already done
something similar with IPsec. I did manage to cover
some basics and IPsec and also lil bit about FreeBSD
in about two hours. 

I want to do it for free with no entry restriction.
And within three hours at max.

If you are too busy to spend some time for this I will
go ahead. 

I shall not be able to cover spam and network security
design but I can accommodate the other topics. :-)

Best,
Girish

seriously its a popular topic and one that needs deeper coverage

so - a two day (or at least one day) workshop rather than the usual 2 
hrs session

with lunch, tea etc breaks and assuming 9:00 to 5:00 thats about 4 sessions

1. basics
2. n/w security
3. spam
4. crypto

Hi,
I have successfully  installed Kubuntu dapper 64 bit in my
intel dual core 2.8 ghz Pentium D( Celeron D is different) system.
Actually there was only an X config problem (ATI Radeon Pci Express
200) which i solved now.

well - you'd talk about concepts like a bastion host, dmz, etc.

This is a firewall vendor (netscreen)'s whitepaper but does spell out a
few
of the concepts in quite clear language. Dates back to 2001 but still ok
http://www.defconpics.org/other/Principles%20of%20Secure%20Network%20Des
ign.pdf

Some cisco press books like this one -
network security basics
http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=170742

and this -
general design considerations for secure networks
http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=174313&rl=1

are also worth a read.

The linux NAG has quite a lot of decent resources in it. 

But by far the best book on this that I know of is "The Practice of
System
and Network Administration" by Limoncelli and Hogan
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=tomontime-

That amazon link is from http://www.everythingsysadmin.com - the
authors'
website, and so I guess the authors get a commission if you buy that
from
amazon.  Everythingsysadmin.com has some great articles in it, worth a
read

I may not be able to make it this saturday - out of town. Sometime in

near future hopefully.

Thanks Suresh. But this much is very clear that there
is no way I am going to be able to talk about these
things just by "bookish" knowledge even if I do find
time to read whatever you sent. 

So whichever weekend you are free we can meet. No
issues. 

Here is a first cut "syllabus" for the talk. Please do
let me know if you find that ok. I am also zero in
spam and it will be wonderful to learn that as well.
Especially Bayesian filtering and stuff. :-)

Security 101

1) What is authentication? 
2) Difference between Symmetric and Asymmetric crypto
3) Threat model and various types of attacks
4) What is RSA? DH? AES? 3DES? Anatomy of ciphering
5) Security on the Internet (securing protocols like
DNS, SMTP, SNMP, HTTP, FTP etc.)
6) Security protocols like SSL,ssh, IPsec

Network Security architecture and design

1) Threat model
2) DMZ, firewalls, proxies
3) Worms, Denial of service attacks on the routers and
TCP/IP infrastructure, discussion about the "Iloveu"
worm(virus?) and few other recent attacks and how you
patched the vulnerabilities
4) VPN design and considerations- implications on
networking, tunneling etc.
5) Spam control theory, architecture of participating
peers and real world examples from Vipul's razor ,
Spamassassin etc...

How you can get started onto the security bandwagon

1) Learn how to use the OpenSSL tool
2) I will demo simple usages of the tool
3) Used for encryption, signing, hashing, keypair
generation, random number generation etc...

Security as a career

1) Where to start and what does the market need?
2) Why security programming will make you a sound
programmer?
3) Need to understand networking very well to
implement security protocols
4) Huge demand for *good* security engineers in the
market. PKI,VPN, networking and crypto knowledge: how
to develop them?

Suresh,

I think I will spend the first 40 minutes intro. Then
you can take over and talk for about 50 minutes. Then
I will demo OpenSSL toolkit and finally wind up with a
light discussion on career options which you should
help me of course. 

Friends,

Have I captured everyone's need? Did I miss anything?

Suresh,

Let us first prepare the slides and send them. That
way at least I will get some time to prepare and ppl
can come knowing what to expect and possibly also come
prepared as security waters are very deep...

My suggestion is let us prepare the slides offlist and
send it as one pdf. 

Bharathi,

Could you arrange sometime this month or at most early
next month when Suresh is free so we can meet? 

Thanks. 

warm regards,
Girish

god, you got the materials for a full 3 day workshop there

no way youre going to cover all this in a 2 hr glv session

probably compress it all into a weekend, morning to evening sessions

do it "at cost" as in people attending it pay a sum thats calculated to 
cover lunch / tea and hall rent if that becomes necessary.  [or at least

pay for lunch / tea - if they do this in the IIT campus or somewhere 
like that there's no food for miles around]

No I am only going to give intro. I have already done
something similar with IPsec. I did manage to cover
some basics and IPsec and also lil bit about FreeBSD
in about two hours. 

I want to do it for free with no entry restriction.
And within three hours at max.

If you are too busy to spend some time for this I will
go ahead. 

I shall not be able to cover spam and network security
design but I can accommodate the other topics. :-)

Best,
Girish

seriously its a popular topic and one that needs deeper coverage

so - a two day (or at least one day) workshop rather than the usual 2 
hrs session

with lunch, tea etc breaks and assuming 9:00 to 5:00 thats about 4
sessions

1. basics
2. n/w security
3. spam
4. crypto

Hi all,

I found some sites which shows more information on games available on linux.


http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq/gamelist.php (this site is very good)
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Games

If you already know abt these links, this mail becomes a spam..
If not, it would be more useful
If you know lot more links, please post here.. it would be useful..

I had done some research on gaming options in Linux. I
also read an article about it in linuxjournal. 

I never play any game other than "fortune" which is
not really a game. :-) So my analysis could be wrong. 

MythTV project(www.mythtv.org) has managed to somehow
"emulate" the old graphical DOS games on Linux. I
haven't tried it, only read about it. There are
thousands of them, check it out!

I have seen folks play marvellous games with graphics,
sound effects and all the jazz reqd for game lovers in
Windoze. And multi player games and network based
games are also somewhat successful I think.

I have seen some games like quake and doom work well
in linux with all the sound effects. 

IMHO, it is a hard fact that the variety and richness
of games available in Windoze is a far cry from what
is avail in linux. And they cost lot of $$$$$

Linux does have some BSD games, GNOME games and KDE
games that have good "eye candy". But then there is no
denying that Windoze is a very big step ahead. 

Largely bcoz game programming is difficult and

Hi,

This is my first email to this LUG so, first of all hello to everyone.

Actually I'm looking for some VOIP Traffic generator to test my voip server
and see how many concurrent calls it can support. I have a asterisk server
running in my home and I want to test how many concurrent call it can
support. I'm using g729.

How do I test any link or clue will be great.

thanks

There seem to be some tools here .
http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/index.php?page=How+to+debug+and+troubleshoot+VoIPhttp://www.voip-info.org/wiki/index.php?page=How+to+debug+and+troubleshoot+VoIP

How did you get Asterisk working? Do you have a card
from Digium? Can you buy it in India? Or do you 
have some other multiport serial card too ?

I guess some components of Asterisk will work without
any specialized hw.

Hi Girish.

If you r taking 2 or 3 hours sessions,
you can use Lynus Academy, Anna nagar too.

It is capable of about 20 members.
And, Mr.Saravanan has promised that,
We can use his place for GLV sessions too.

So, you can contact him at 940880558.
current, I hope he has less mail access.

I hope Project is not there.

We can use IIT or ELCOT too.
They have good projector servces.

waiting for you.

dear,
T.Shrinivasan.

Hi,

thanks for reply. I tried all the tools and links from voip info wiki but
none is free to test. Regarding getting Digium card yes you can get in
India. For this setup I don't have any Digium card. Actually I want to test
the load of how many calls it can support. So Digium has nothing to do with
this.
thanks

Arun

You wanted VoIP traffic generator. 
http://sipp.sourceforge.net/ is a free SIP traffic
generator mentioned in the website I sent.

Also SIP is a pure software thingy; so u might 
find it useful especially since u don't have Digium
hardware. 

You mentioned that you are using g.729 codec. Do u
want to stress test it? 

Can u be more specific as to what exactly u r looking
for. Asterisk supports several features. Which ones
do u want to test?

It is possible that with a simple combo of few command
line UNIX tools u may be able to achieve ur goal.

If u tell us clearly what u r trying to achieve then
we may be in a better position to help u out.

Also let me know where Digium cards are available and
at what cost? T1 or E1? Do u get it in Richie street?

Thanks. 

Best,

SMTP is for sending alone. Receiving is done thro'
POP3 protocol or rarely IMAP. It could be port no. 110
or 143 respectively. IMAP is not so popular, so in
most cases it is gonna be POP3.

Try from windoze cmd prompt
C:> telnet 192.168.134.16 110

If it connects and displays a hello message, it is
good news. 

You can also run an interactive POP3 session like this

Good job and keep up the spirit of FLOSS. But.. Just an observation..

Nowadays information is flowing in late or am I missing some mails?
Why is it that people dont intimate to the LUG before conducting a
seminar? I do not want an answer like it has been put up on the
"Events page of the Chennai LUG wiki". Is there any specific reason
for the same? Sorry. Just asked because for the past few events the
mails have come in only after the event has been conducted. Thats why
curious to know the reason behind it.

Cheers.

I normally feel we need to discuss prior when we are in need of
volunteers from LUG. Why disturb all when I can manage?. In this case
Prof.Srinivasan was in the College for some other reason and during
the conversation they hit upon the idea of seminar. He rang up from
there, I agreed for it. As NRCFOSS is arranging for few of their
members, I didn't think it is necessary to call for volunteers. 

There was no other reason, for not keeping the list informed before
the event.

In my opinion prior discussion/information is required only when
a.The event is open for public. In this case the information helps
other to attend/give publicity.

b.You need volunteers

Raman.P

 On the same lines, how does ISP say BSNL achieve bandwidth control for
users (ie they sell 256kbps, 512kbps etc..)? Do they use different servers
for each speed or some thing like that?

They use hardware bandwidth control; not software
bandwidth throttling. 

BSNL and other ISPs achieve it at a "per DSL link
level" or something like that. 

ADSL is a separate topic by itself. It stands for
Asymmetric Digital Subsciber Loop. The word asymmetric
means that the upstream and downstream bandwidths are
no identical. For instance at home I get a downstream
of roughtly 280 kbps but upstream is only around 64. 

This is a limitation imposed by the purity of copper,
the characteristics of the devices at the termination
end points etc.

For instance my modem can even scale upto Megabits.
But it is limited by exchange side equipment.

TCP detects the hardware limit and adjusts
accordingly.

It is a complex topic. So let me stop here. 

I hope I made myself fairly clear.

Girish

In fedora the /etc/fstab contains the LABEL= as the first field
instead of device file name like /dev/hda1. With LABEL=, fedora
searches for a partition with label /. It appears that two partitions
have lable named /.  There are two ways of rectifying

a. Change in /etc/fstab (under fedora) LABEL=/ with /dev/hdan, hdan
stands for the partition where root(fedora) file system resides. 

 Since you are not able to run fedora, run debian mount fedora root
partition somewhere and edit etc/fstab of the mounted partition.

b. Change the label using tune2fs

Dear friends: [Attention :aanjhan /  raman / parthan]

in future, we will make a posting regarding any event scheduled (even if we
have fixed the date & time, and also the speakers). Of course, specific
request will be made if we are just planning the events. This will help
avoidance of multiple efforts.

As Raman mentioned, I had gone to address the Jerusalem IT students and the
workshop got fixed over a phone call.

Will send two separate mails now regarding requests from a couple of
colleges.

Dear friends:
I.F.E.T COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, a member of the NRCFOSS -- Elective
trainging group -- is keen to have a FOSS awarness event on 11th August 2006
(Friday).

If we can find enough volunteers, we can conduct a one-day workshop (basics
-- installation -- a bit of addl exposure to guide them towards FOSS
projects). Would appreciate your responses by Monday morning (at the latest)
so that we could fix the programme with the college by Monday evening.

Otherwise, I am committed to address the students -- inauguration of their
CSE association -- on 11th Aug. If we do not have the workshop on that day,
I will propose to have it at a later date (based on volunteer availability).


For these workshops, we will try to have Parthan and Ashwin (or at least one
of them) to be part of the training team.

With best wishes, Srinivasan.

I think I will have to make myself clear on this thing. I was saying
that if it was given a prior intimation (even if no volunteers are
required), the people (especially students) who are there in this
mailing list can get to know that there is gonna be such event
happening. Beleive me or not, Most of the students inside Jerusalem
itself would not be aware of such a thing happening. If prio post is
done then it could be helpful in us (other passive luggies) informing
those students via our network or something also and could enable the
students make the most of the same. Yeah might increase awareness by a
trickle only or the above suggestion might be stupid and baseless but
we could gain one more interested student by that way!??

Message-ID: <92f9a9560608051247l386ca0c8wcb99adce80a5a321@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to retire CVS as my version control system and move to
something newer.  Can someone recommend a version control
system that fits my requirement below?

My requirement is that I need to store source code, binaries,
and device files.  The system must also store the following file
meta data:  owner/group, mode, and soft/hard link information.
Preserving and recreating hard links is important as I expect
to have several.  Commits and updates need to be fairly fast
as the repository is expected to grow to ~100MB.

I'm considering subversion and gnu-arch.  I would like to hear
from anyone who has used either system.  Any other suggestions
are equally welcome.

Thanks in advance for your time and suggestions.

I am afraid I can't help you much but I will give my
two cents. 

What is wrong with CVS? The wire protocol is not
efficient. It is an aged program with few annoyances.
With all its merits , it still makes difficult things
difficult. 

What is good with it? It is very good at facilitating
code development with developers distributed over
geographic boundaries and time zones. 

It is useful enuf for an average user that needs
version control.

But the wire protocol is not efficient. 

Now let us come to subversion. It is brand new and
nearly every open source project has cut over to it.
Why? It gives you several options for using either
http, https along with webdav or even some other
protocol to be layered below it. 

And it gives u several other niceties too though I am
not sure if it has what you need. 

GNU Arch? No idea.

I can give u a few ideas though.
1)  Normally these tools are tailored for storing
source code. You can of course store binaries but if
you can derive it from the source, pls dont store it.
However things like firmware, pdf doc can be stored.
But it should only be around 5% IMHO. If you want to
backup and replicate binary data u can use several
other protocols like rsync . It will be better to
check the MD5 or SHA1 checksum everytime a xfer
happens. 

2) If you want high efficiency and speed in commits
and updates, you can use rsync as the underneath
protocol. And better make sure the backend DB is an
efficient one, maybe Sleepycat's Berkeley DB or
something. I know it is possible in CVS, dont know
about SVN.

3) You can run a cron job to update the repositories
every few hours using cvsup or something. That way u
can save time and latency when u run update or commit.

Sorry I don't know anything more than that.

But if I were you I would stick to SVN since others
have already made the decision for me. 

Best,
Girish

	Karpagam Arts and Science College, Coimbatore
Message-ID: <20060806022549.23790.qmail@web50214.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

I conducted a full-day "Introduction to Free/Libre
Open Source Software" workshop on Saturday, August 5,
2006 at Karpagam Arts and Science College, Coimbatore,
Tamil Nadu, India.

I covered career opportunities with FLOSS, free/libre
open source software that is available for
students/engineers, the GNU/Linux desktop,
localization with GNU/Linux, and played the movie,
"The Revolution OS". 

You can check out the photos from here:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album33

I would like to thank Prof. E. Karthikeyan, Senior
Lecturer, Computer Science Department to have arranged
for the workshop in one week's time, and for the
wonderful hospitality offered.

* The students were from the CS and MCA department.

* Usually, I prefer to speak in Tamil within Tamil
Nadu, but, because the audience comprised of people
from Tamil Nadu and Kerala, English was preferred.

* The college has recently received autonomous status.
I have given AU-KBC contacts to them to take up FLOSS
projects, and to start taking FLOSS initiatives to
serve the community in and around Coimbatore.

* They _will_ be starting a GNU/Linux Campus Club/User
Group on campus, soon.

* They do require technical support and guidance
(initially, atleast) from ILUGC, AU-KBC members for
FLOSS work.

Regards,

SK

Dear All,

Greetings, All the posters/promotion material we had, is now with ARUNAI
ENGG COLLEGE. Now that we are going to have another LDD at JEC thiruninarvur
,we need these material desperately. We made  good attempt to get those
material  from AEC but not fruitful. As time runs out we need such material
which may be used for the upcoming LDD and as well as for the upcoming any
events such as software freedom day/walk. Though we can print it, we are in
search of nice wordings in the posters. Kindly update This thread with some
good wordings on FLOSS which may be printed and placed in the LDD.


Thanking you,

Message-ID: <20060806060110.71485.qmail@web35606.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear friends,

I did that for my friend. Airtel flatly refused that
it can ever be made to work under Linux. I kept on
insisting and then they conceded that it might be
possible but we don't support it. 

I agree, it was not easy . Anyway that doesn't matter
now.

If any of you folks are having an Airtel USB modem
from Beetel model 100CX and wish to get that working
under linux, get in touch with me. 

Maybe I could write a wiki article on this. How else
can I make sure other folks all over the country
benefit by this discovery? 

Thanks in advance to all suggestions. 

I will try to write a simple shell script to make the
job as easy as possible. But kernel modules are
involved, so it is not so easy.

The interesting thing is I am writing this mail from
my BSNL connection connected with the Airtel modem!
:-)

Under Linux of course.

regards,
Girish

Not sure if this would fit every requirement of yours, but considering 
ease of deployment and use, Mercurial 
[http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/] is my choice these days.

I used subversion for all my projects and I feel that it is one of the
best. Yes of course CVS is also fine. But the versioning and other
stuff in subversion is very cool and lot more flexilble and easy.

Of course to add to the above creating a subversion repository is also
pretty easy :)

I too had the same problem some time back, I solved it by simply
changing the menu.lst. I assume you have installed debian3.1 or less.
The problem with the debian3.1 is the grub is not doing the work
properly. Again I assume that you are able to login into your debian
system, and it should be. If so you just open your menu.lst in your
favourite text editor and then add the initrd image of FCx which you
have, if you want to know what is the initrd your FCx used just open
the grub.conf in your FCx partition and have a look at it.

This is a sample, note I use FC4:
initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.17-1.2139_FC4.img

Add the above line and reboot to your FCx system and it will go fine :)

Hmmm I too meddled with the above LABELs and things when I was stuck
up with the problem but the real thing lies in the initrd image not
mentioned for FCx system in the menu.lst which debian created :) May
be this will be solved in etch...

Some thoughts:

* Please let us know if we are having a hands-on
training session for students this weekend, August
12-13, 2006 to Jaya Engineering College students. If
yes, how and when will the transport be arranged for
NRCFOSS/ILUGC volunteers.

* Having a two-day session is great. But, make sure
students in stalls work in shifts, a team in the
forenoon, another in the afternoon. Talking in the
stalls for one full-day will be extremely exhausting.

* Transportation for NRCFOSS/ILUGC volunteers for the
LDD to be held on August 19-20, 2006. The timings for
the LDD to be announced as well.

* If the stalls are not in an air-conditioned hall,
please arrange for fans for the computers, and stall
students.

* Make sure you do good publicity to other schools,
colleges, and that you advertise in the newspapers.

* If you can upload an electronic copy of the event
poster, we can distribute it through e-mail to our
colleagues at work.

* If you require any additional systems or want ILUGC
volunteers to lend systems, make sure you label them
appropriately so it doesn't get mixed with you college
computers.

* During the LDD if any student is not sure on the
question posed to him/her, they can feel free to pass
it on to any NRCFOSS/ILUGC volunteer in the premises.

* Please keep all communication in this mailing list
as it will be a good learning experience for
new-comers, and we will know the update/status of the
LDD.

Looking forward (as always),

SK

I know Jaya Group has several schools under there banner itself. May
be you can send invites to them as well apart from the list of
colleges that are also under its banner.

subversion. subversion.
There are many commercial and community sites using subversion. It is
not just to store source code but files belonging to different file
type can be stored here. It's more than the improved CVS. You can
access it via http, https, svn, file protocols. The subversion
development team is very active. You can use pre/post hook scripts to
highly customize the repository. The swig bindings for perl, python,
ruby & java are available if you need connectors for Subversion. The
gui client programs like tortoisesvn are available to access the
repository. The web based applications (viewvc) are available to view
the content of repository online.

You can check out[1] link for a comparison chart and you take a call!

It is very much possible to do it using software.

visit www.easybrowsing.com for some details
This guy is my friend and he has developed a ISP billing software.
It is capable of allotting /measuring bandwidth and time usage.
I was helping him in marketing this software to a few people.

I wouldn't know if you ask him how he will tell /help you.
Guy is making some good money by selling the software
and  it is his business secret.

All i can say is it is definitely possible using software.
( may be refer good tech manuals for details on how or even write to him)

We very much need you to guide students on 'Linux Kernel'. I have just 
told them to go through the very basics. Can you tell me the topics they 
need to be aware of/learn in the coming one week, so that when (assuming 
that you meet them next week) you meet them they would have done some 
home work :)

We have around 160 Volunteers, each topic has enough number of 
volunteers to make sure the load is shared between all. I have asked the 
students (under my topic list) in a way that each one learns one part of 
the whole topic, daily interact with one another and share what they 
learn. I hope this will make all of them to be aware of what they have 
taken up, though the overall load is shared :)

Don't Worry. Today the car (sumo) came at correct time. I don't think 
there will be a delay. We have asked to send two or more vehicles, in 
separate routes so that the volunteers can be picked up.

The stalls are (except a few like multimedia which is going to be put in 
a class room) are located in their big canteen/mess hall, which is 
almost to the size of Hanger1 in MIT (a little bit too much exaggeration 
indeed :P). And there are enough number of fans. There is also an 
additional small room, where we can have the intro talks in batches or 
put up some computers for hands-on session to school children.

All engineering colleges and arts colleges are going to be invited

Systems won't be a problem, if the organizing goes as per our plans. 
There enough number of systems as both CSE and IT are collectively 
organizing this LDD, both their machine strength is available for use :)

They have been asked to join Mailing List. I am handling a few 
(fortunately your subject of interest, the Kernel too :D) I will pass on 
all the queries to you, perhaps show them how to contact you apart from 
the LUG-mailing list. I have told them to workout your device driver 
examples (one or two of them, and teach to others) so that they learn to 
do something. I will be mailing them, with your kind permission ;)

I have initialized the communication here.. Hope it continues without a 
fall-off :d

Some Facts:

1. Number of volunteers is large, some 160. More at disposal :D
2. Getting systems is not a issue, as they have very good labs.
3. Our experience with Arunai LDD have thought us some lessons, which 
will be utilized here (for eg. I asked Harish to ensure that everything 
is ready to use, on 18th night itself. Make sure all stalls get power 
supply and all systems are ready 100%)
4. The expected number of visitors is 4000 for 2 days : 2000 per day : 
30 stalls : 4-8 volunteers per stall : each volunteer handles 2000/8 = 
250 : 10 per batch --> 25 batches/volunteer/day :D
5. As the LDD is for 2 days, the load may vary. Also, the 
volunteers/students have a chance to learn on the first day and put up a 
great show on the second day ;)

Anouncement:

As usual we call for *Physical Volunteers*. Atleast for the next weekend 
to train the people. We need volunteers especially for Kernel, 
Netowrking, Development (C,C++,Perl,Python). I hope Shakthi and Anjhan 
are able to make it. I also need some emac'ians :D (Joe? Prashant?)

All ideas/comments/suggestions from dear luggies are whole-heartedly 
welcomed and will be taken into consideration. We have full two weeks, 
so we hope we will be able to train them well and make them put an 
excellent show, making us more happier than what we felt when leaving 
Arunai LDD ;)

Dear all,

I was wondering if any mobile service provider in

instance speaking to A and B in a teleconference. 

I know it is technically feasible and I have done that
within an EPABX setup but I was wondering if any
mobile service provider in India gives that facility. 

Thanks.

I'd appreciate any feedback from other device

this mailing list.

Because, the audience are school/colleges students,
the y can get to know about the Linux kernel features,
basic device drivers, their compilation, usage
(insmod, rmmod), kernel compilation HOWTO etc.

This Saturday, August 12, 2006, not sure yet. Will let
you all know. 

I am available on Sunday.

Anjuta is a Indian Project and should be demoed.. A good one and is on
the Ubuntu repos too ;)

What about Qemu, VMPlayer?

May be we could handle more than one language here. Not restricting
ourselves to TAMIL.

Nah. I still feel GNU/Hurd would *not* be very attractive. EDA tools
is kinda offtopic is what i feel and I am not in for having it as a
seperate stall. Comments welcome

> 17. CVS/SVN

May be this can be demoed with sample projects? Mercurial, bazaar NG??
Some front end for the same like eSVN can also be used?

> 22. Educational Tools

Edubuntu could be useful here I gues.. No flames intended :D


Cheers.

10a. Linux Kernel.

10b. GNU Hurd.

10c. EDA tools.

Everything in one stall will be just too much.

27. FSF-India stall.

28. ILUGC stall (Common, we need one).

Exactly. WE could remove off HURD is what my opinion is and EDA, I am
kinda skeptical.

What do you propose to put in here? May be we can tell about GPLv3 and

1. That was proposed and not yet implemented. SK, your previous mail 
about what to do in Linux Kernel will be conveyed. I too think HURD 
would be too much an ask for n00bs. And EDA tools, I am not sure how 
much CS students will be willing. So, as of now I will ask them to go 
through what you said in the last mail and practise your example programs :)

2. There will be a separate stall for ilugc and NRCFOSS. Thats sure, I 
hope so :)

Both HURD and EDA Tools dropped off.

Linux Kernel will have
1.General idea about Linux Kernel
2. Device Driver Basics
3. Kernel Compliation
3. How kernel can be dynamically loaded using insmod and use of lsmod

Will this be enough ? Are there some more topics they can cover ?

Something to talk, perhaps about ilugc's activities and how to join 
mailing list, how to make use of our help.... can't we ?
May be we can distribute Chennai LUG

CD Burning stall is proposed to be put. There might a small quiz 
competition where a person telling 10 correct answers continuously might 
get a Free CD ;)

Show our LUG wiki  and our

Same as above, why can't we ? We have lots to tell ? We are examples :D

Its very important. 

1. FLOSS is _not_ only for IT and CS students. It is
useful to all other departments.

2. EDA is inter-disciplinary for students coming from
CS/IT/EEE/ECE/ICE backgrounds. Honestly, they don't do
much inter-disciplinary work.

It really doesn't matter whether you are from x or y
department in most engineering colleges in India, as
they hardly learn anything in the first place. So this
will be a good example. Nobody said a student from
CS/IT shouldn't do VLSI in the industry, if he/she is
really interested. Unfortunately it is not flexible
here in India. But, it is very much possible in US
universities. Anyways.

When you come to the industry you only work on
specific domains - Embedded (firmware, device driver,
kernel development) or VLSI (verification,
validation).

Did you know that there are students with a CS
background who also do chip verification?

Just my thoughts,

SK

Thanks to everyone for their suggestions.

Some two years ago, Venki from Collabnet spoke about SVN at the
lug meet.  He remarked that one of his colleagues who was a DB
developer had not only his code in SVN, but also the entire Oracle
installation including a test DB!

My current requirement is similar in that it comprises of part source
code and part binaries.  File permissions, ownership and hard links
must be versioned on the binaries.  I'm running svn 1.3.0 and am
unable to coax svn to version file metadata.  I have the following in
my ~/.subversion/config.

[auto-props]
* = svn:text-time=yes;svn:owner=yes;svn:group=yes;svn:unix-mode=yes

Any help is much appreciated.

I never meant EDA Tools wouldn't be useful. Am a EEE grad and am myself 
in FLOSS. So being my self an example, I won't dare mean that. Perhaps, 
I wish Mech, ECE and EEE could join with these guys and show more which 
will be really useful to the non-IT/CSE students.
I will ask the 6 'kernel' volunteers about the same, i.e. whether two of 
them can work on EDA tools.

Your thoughts are most welcome. :)

Ok.

Because the students have not seen any form of
inter-disciplinary work, and what they know is about
strict course framework in their curriculum, they
usually think its not useful to them. Its just their
ignorance. 

As mentors, it is our responsibility and duty to
provide the necessary exposure to them on the
different avenues that FLOSS can take them to.

Great! Aanjhan should be here this weekend, so he can
guide them as well.

My thoughts on the above is similar. The EDA development is more to do
with Data structures and ofcourse a fair/very strong hold on
Elelctronics. The Industry has reached a stage where there are a lot
of algorithms to improve the design but all these will become reality
only when it is implemented in the EDA tool and this is becoming a
challenging area and IMO has a very good research prospective. For
more on the FOSS EDA Tools you can check on the following

Bandwidth is also controlled by software in the cases like hathway or other 
cable services.
Where a boot file is sent to the modem everytime it starts and logs into the 
network
the boot file restricts the bandwidth from the user side .
no wonder ppl uncap hathway modems to get speeks like 500 kbps  :)

yes you  can  install n number of os in the same hard disk , just make sure
you partition them properly , and also make the root partitions bootable , 
you can use a simple partition manager tool to help you like ranish boot 
manager and if oyou fins it still difficult download one of those easy to 
use gui based boot manager :)

Hi all
Interdisciplinary activities are pretty minimal in most of the
colleges -- even to have CSE and IT together is not an easy job, and
MCA gets left out as a distant cousin.

Will it be possible to catch a few volunteers from Mech dept -- let
them look at QCAD, PythonCAD and Calculix. They can just play around
and give their comments as to the ease of use, plus points and
deficiencies. If we can catch a few guys to work on PythonCAD, it will
be great. To start with, we can work on migration related to Anna Univ
curriculum labs.

Parthan: If necessary, we can think of a discussion session at NRCFOSS
this saturday (12th). We can try to catch some MIT students and
generate specific action plan.

Srinivasan.

I was told the limit was 4, not n. I don't know
whether it is a BIOS limitation. I think you can't
have more than 4 different bootable partitions in an
x86 box. 

Is my knowledge outdated by any chance?

I'm just curious to know why do you need to put binaries under version 
control.  How does it help?

Many of my binaries are not generated from local source, they are
binary only or come from other external sources.  A single release
must therefore contain a particular version of code and binaries.
Hence the fancy version control requirements.

I am sure you must be aware how version control sw
works internally. It stores only the diffs between
multiple versions. This works only with sources that
change thro' versions.

Whereas if you put multiple binaries, the version
control sw will choke since a one line change in the
source that produced the binary will be completely
different.

My binaries come from *external* sources,  ie. not compiled
out of source that sits in the same repository.  Some files
are binary only, and I don't even have the source for them.

I need to ensure that a certain release has all the correct
versions of all these individual binaries as well my own
binaries generated from CVS source.

You can do this with subversion using the propset, propget, proplist
commands. Subversion recognizes set of predefined special versioned
properties but it is not limited to that. It also recognizes the
unlimited arbitrary properties. For example, to version the file
permission you can run the following set of command:
$ svn propset permission '-rw-r--r--' your_binary_file.bin && svn commit

Similarly, to version the file group, you can run the following command:
$ svn propset file_group 'user_name group_name' your_binary_file.bin
&& svn commit

See, propset, propget, proplist, propdel commands for more details.
You can also refer[1] for more details.

Do you really need to store the binary itself?  Couldnt you store the 
binary in a directory / rename it so that it is tagged with its version 
number.  Or find a way to make it spit out its version number on the 
command line (binary --version or whatever).

Have a field in your repository that stores the actual version numbers 
involved.  The binary is not going to change very much .. just maintain 
all the possible versions of your binary like I said.  Call the 
appropriate binary based on the version # stored in cvs / svn.

Dear all,

Thanks for various suggestions from all, specifically Shakthi and
Aanjhan. My thoughts/request on this are

a.Coming Sunday(13/8/06) (Note Saturday is our regular lug) we need
volunteers to train students on the topics already proposed. Whoever
is wiling please update list/me. Transport will be arranged by the
college.

b.Volunteers for actual event on 19th and 20th August. This time we
need more because
     i) It is two day LDD.
    ii)  There will be two lecture halls - for school and college 
         students separately
   iii)  More number of topics covered.
    iv)  The expected attendance will be about 4000
     v)  As rightly suggested by Sakthi we need a separate stall for
         ILUGC.  Here we will tell about our activities. We can also
         use the opportunity to talk to students/faculties from other
         colleges and arrange for events like seminar/ldds etc.
         I wish we can even finalise the dates if the college is    
         willing.

c.If ILUGC volunteers are there we can add extra topics.

Subject: [Ilugc] regarding autoruncd
Message-ID: <20060807073626.22657.qmail@web60316.mail.yahoo.com>

   Hi peter,

I tried the way you mentioned in your website for making autorunCD.But its not working.Mine is Debian sarge system.I want to have a utility disc of my own.So i need CD to run automatically.And also as u mentioned
..
..

Linux
                   Create a file called autorun containing a shell script which will locate and execute a browser on the specified file. In theory it could be as short as this: 

#! /bin/sh
>>> htmlview index.html

   
>> I dont have htmlview command so i am using firefox

   
>> just for testing..but its not working 


   
>>autorun script itself not working
       
However, some systems fail to import the path for                     autorun correctly, or they                     start up in the user's home directory  instead of the                     CD mount-point, so they fail to find                     htmlview; others don't                     implement htmlview at all,                     so it's easier to use something like 

   >>>>>>>>>>>this link is not working....

           http://research.silmaril.ie/autoruncd/autorun

   
this                           script, which tests for different ways to open the file. You may want to edit it to do other things also.

Request to all.

Please volunteer to above topics. Additionally we need extra help
from others.
For each topic we would like a small writeup, Features of the open
source tools we are demonstarting, in some cases like clusters a
simple sketch to explain the configuration/physical layout. 
Hence, please point to links where we can get such documents for each
software.

This makes it easier for students to prepare.

We will soon putup the topics in the wiki page. Once it is done I
will announce it in the list. Thereafter please update the wiki with
above details.

Also please explain me,
is there any difference to do a  java based developement in GNU/Linux
platform and the Sun's own platform. (any Advantages?)

thanks in advance.

2. And from my laptop, as a root user, I executed the following command,
2.a,  /sbin/ifconfig  eth0 192.168.1.2 up
2.b,  /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.1.1
3.And if i do ping my to my modem 192.168.1.1 , it respond.
4. In the browser, I have viewed the modem index,  http://192.168.1.1  and
login as admin, admin, and then in the PV0, I have configured with my
dataone login and password.
5. And do the ping test to modem ( it works fine ).
6. And then do the modem test, it fails. And ping to outside world not
responded.

Can any one clarify me what am i doing wrong. ?  My intension is to
configure my modem in such a way to work wiith my linux in wi-fi.

Any help in this regard is highly appreciated.

Solaris *is* Unix.  See the Unix history chart at:
    http://www.levenez.com/unix/
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix

Last year Sun made the source code for various bits of Solaris 10
(and beyond) available to the community.  Sun released the code
under the CDDL license:
    http://www.opensolaris.org/os/about/faq/licensing_faq/

OpenSolaris offers a few excellent features:  DTrace, Zones, ZFS.


> i got confused, is it a another distro?or any other licenses issue?

Similar to Linux, 3rd party vendors have built distributions around
the OpenSolaris kernel and userland.  IMO, Nexenta (gnusolaris.org)
is the best OpenSolaris distro around. It combines a OpenSolaris
kernel with an Debian^H^H Ubuntu userland.

As far as the development goes, it's the same story with Java:  you
write once and debug everywhere.

Solaris has been traditionally strong on the multi-threading and scalability
end of things.  And this goes well with Java's heavily threaded nature.
I suppose today's Linux has closed the performance gap (if not surpassed
it already) so there's not much advantage in running Java on Solaris as
opposed to Linux.

Your suggestion is better than the quick-n-dirty hacks I had in mind.
Thanks!

I think I'll settle for hacking the missing bits into svn hooks and custom
scripts.  The fact that I can store metada using svn propset/get should
be pretty handy.

I fear that at some point in the future, I'll fail to run "svn propset ..." on
some file and break things in weired and wonderful ways.

Is there some way svn can automatically pickup file mode, user and
group information on evey commit?  Ofcourse, svn also needs to
automatically apply them on a checkout.  Or do I need to handle
them through the hooks?

The SVN doc says that it is as efficient with binaries as it is with
text, by virtue of the algo it uses... and hence binaries are not an
issue at all...

The whole solution is Linux based and uses the  controls of Linux.

Ok to give you some idea of what i know

A Linux system has to be setup with two Ethernet cards
One card should be connected to the backbone ( the 512 k /1 mb  or 2 mb line
you get from your isp)
The other card should be connected to the switch where all other systems are
connected.
now download the trail version of the software from the above site and
install it.
You will have the following options to control

1. restricting bandwidth ( like 64 k or 128 k for each of the client systems
on your network)
2. restricting the time to use the Internet browsing like only between 3pm
to 6 pm
3. restricting the max download ie like 2 mb or 3 mb per day
4 Accounting

different setting can be done for each of the local ip address ie each
system in your local network. it also works based on network login id if it
is dhcp.


This is used by a few isps for billing and some large Internet browsing
centers 250+ systems in india and many countries abroad.
This also works for  wireless isps hot spot / wifi wimax.
It is a c program on  linux os.

mail the developer for more details.
He is selling this package for 300 $.
If you happan to end up buying it , pl let me know.
I get a beer as referal commision from him.

Subject: [Ilugc] regarding pci  vga card output with powerpc
Message-ID: <44D73621.1060809@gmail.com>

Hello All,
I need help regarding the pci vga card output with powerpc.

I am working with a pci based vga card. I have connected the vga card 
next to the  pci slot of my target processor on the baseboard.
I have connected a monitor to the vga card.
When i boot linux from minicom, i could see all the kernel log messages 
on both the minicom and vga card monitor. But on the vga monitor, i 
could not see any messages after asking for login as below:
.
.

Mounting filesystems
Running depmod
Setting up networking on loopback device:
Setting up networking on eth0:
eth0: PHY is Marvell 88E11x1 (1410cc2)
Adding static route for default gateway to 192.168.3.1:
Setting nameserver to 192.168.0.1 in /etc/resolv.conf:
Starting inetd:

login:


Though i am entering my login and passwd at the minicom, nothing comes 
on to the vga monitor. But i am able to write to vga monitor using the 
following commands from minicom:

# echo "Hello" > /dev/tty1
# echo "Hi " > /dev/tty1
My requirement is to get on the vga monitor whatever i am typing on the 
minicom after logging into the linux like .
ls or pwd commands.

Anyone pl help me.

Thanks & Regards
Sudheer

I understand, the requirement is specific to your WC. So, you may not be able to
run the pre-hook scripts from the repository. I see two things to do here:

1) Automate the process of setting these arbitrary properties for a file
2) Incorporate these changes when you commit

Solutions:

1) I guess, the way to go is to write a custom script to set these
properties for a file using propset command
2) You can set an alias for 'commit' (if it's ok) to run the custom
script and invoke the actual 'svn commit' command

Since, your requirement seem to be specific to your WC and no one else
may be interested to have this setup, i guess it would fit in your
need. If others do, set the alias for them as well!

Which one? Does the baseboard also have a keyboard,
mouse input?

You will be passing something like "video=" option to
the kernel command line.

Usually, the hardware is designed such that the
keyboard/mouse on the baseboard functions with the
on-board VGA. Not sure which one you are using or
which Linux kernel you are using.

Because input/output goes to the serial port _and_ is
not redirected to the VGA.

Sure, hardware is visible to all.

My question is "Why?". 

The baseboard is supposed to be converted to an
end-product. Serial port is only for developers. An
end-user will use the on-board VGA, keyboard, mouse to
use the system, rather than the serial port. But, if
you want to do it, you also need to redirect the
serial buffer data to the framebuffer driver.

Regards,

SK

This trick though a dirty hack worked for me. But the
problem is output will go only to VGA and not to
minicom. Is that fine by u?
# exec 1</dev/tty1
After this whatever u type will go to vga

Hello Shakti Kannan,

I think i am not clear in the way i said about the setup.

The setup is
Target - Freescale MPC8360 (Host Mode).
VGA card sits on the pci bus of MPC8360.

The VGA card details are as follows.
Vendor ID=0x1002 Device ID= 0x4752
Name: ATI Technologies Inc Rage XL

MPC8360 is connected to x86 pc with a serial port for minicom.
A monitor is connected to vga card.

I have changed the following:
In the ramdisk file system
1. etc/inittab file, we added
:::respawn:/sbin/getty tty1 115200 vt1002.

 While configuring the linux, we have enable the Virtual Terminal option.

 From minicom, after booting the u-boot,
I have modified the bootargs to:
=> set bootargs console=tty1 console=ttyS0,115200

While booting linux, i could see all the kernel log messages on monitor 
connected to vga card that i get on the minicom, but could not see on 
the vga monitor once it asks for the login. Whatever i do on the minicom 
(after mpc8360 booting to linux), i need to get them on vga monitor also.

In the end product we dont have any keyboard, etc.

As you said, I will try with redirecting the serial buffer data  to 
frame buffer .

Thanks & Regards
Sudheer

Where does it talk about Linux or any other OS stuff ? It speaks all

Hi all,

When asked how Ubuntu takes care for Updates, I was told that the
apt-watch(which is a Gnome applet) takes care of
it.I was searching for an equivalent kde applet but in the apt-watch source
code README, the author has mentioned that there is no support for other
desktop environments than Gnome (didnt expect this!). I asked even the
debian irc channels and they too told me the same.

I have not used Kubuntu. How are the updates being handled with Kubuntu?.
How is User notified with new updates?.Are they using the same apt-watch ?

Thanks.

Thanks for volunteering. We expect the volunteers to

a.If possible spend some time with the student volunteers - educate,
install and train them in the topic - before the event.
b.Be present during the demo days. Students will be the first one to
talk to the visitors. We normally intervene when the queries cannot
be handled by them or if we feel it is not properly explained by
students.

Once wiki page is ready please update your details in it.

We will make announcement about wiki soon.

Raman.P

Literally You can make all your partitions bootable,
The limitation of 4 is for primary partitions , ie the no of partition
entries
 that can be there in the MBR.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record

This is not an X86 limitation but a standard followed .

Well actually this is what happened at my workplace
years ago.

Myself to Boss : So you can install as many OSes as
you want right?
Boss to myself : Yes, any number as long as it is less
than or equal to 4

I found it very hard to agree with him but I picked
myself up and moved on. :-)

There are several factors playing here. The OS has to
support booting from a point beyond the scary 1024
cylinder limit. OpenBSD is notorious for that. Though
I think they have fixed that now. 

In fact I will first make sure that I really am able
to boot more than 4 OSes by making 4 primary and
remaining logical partitions and test whether the nth
OS that is lying way off from the disk beginning is
able to boot. 

Boot loaders also have to support this of course.
These days grub seems to be really popular though grub
also is still lacking in certain things. 

Anyway if any of you are successful in booting more
than 4 OSes pls do let me know. 

But for all practical purposes I think this limit will
hardly hit us.

Girish

Once if you have created 4 primary partition  you cannot create more than
that ,
your logical partition can be created only if you have atleast one extended
partition


Boot loaders also have to support this of course.

Literally it is possible to have more than 4 OS in different partitions,
but presently most of them doesnt consider the other operating system
which lies in the hard disk ,  every operating system wants its boot loader
code to be installed in the MBR ( except linux AFAIK)  , some of them needs
atleast a primary partition (eg MINIX) ,

But for all practical purposes I think this limit will

Thanks for the offer. As you could see, there are no other volunteers
so far -- the action is currently on full swing re LDD at Jaya Engg
College.

I will be visiting the college on 11th -- they are having a 2 hr
function to inaugurate their CSE association, and we have to discuss
re FOSS elective. HoD CSE said she will let us know alternate dates so
that we could plan a comprehensive event.

Thanks once again, Srinivasan.

Well I asked the question on 

freebsd-hackers@freebsd.org.

I was told that the 4 OS limit in MBR still exists. 

We have to live with that depressing reality. :-)

If I get to see an optimistic reply I will let you
know. 

Best,

i dont see any reason to need more than two or three os.
but anyway just to prove to you that it is possible
i posted a link which shows you how a man installed 30+ os in 1 system .
so it is possible but just not needed :)
and as someone else had already stated 4 is a standard not a limitation.

All these limits might  be for just one reason "Backward Compatibilty"

I dont think  this is possible  entirely with OS consisting of only  windows
series or DOS variants , their naming convention restrict them from A to Z,
probably they cant exceed 24 partitions since A and B are allotted  floppy
drives,  I wonder how they name a partition next to Z:  !

Dear ILUGC's  
   I am using Slackware 10.1.I getting the below 
mentioned problems when to log into init level 3 or init level 4(KDE).
              1. I am not able to switch from KDE  to 
konsole(ctrl-alt-F{1,2,3,5,6}) keys.My monitor becomes blank and I am not also able to 
switch to KDE again (ctrl-alt-F7).
              2. Each time I have to type init command to reboot and 
halt the system and also the shutdown scripts  are not visible,ie my 
screen turns into blank.

   
     I tried to solve the problem by passing kernel option "vga=normal"  
during booting but it doesnt work.
                              Any Suggestions .Thanks in advance.
                                                                                       
                                                  regards,

Think your X is not configured properly. Try fixing
your /etc/X11/XF86Config or /etc/X11/xorg.conf (  I
don't know which one is used by Slackware). XFree86 or
X.org? Most likely the former.

If you can get X running you can use the "xf86cfg"
command to fine tune your X installation. Are you
getting a good resolution? Or ugly looking large
windows?

I think slackware will have its own script for X
configuration. Run that.

If you send us the "lspci" output I think someone with
your video card will be able to give you hints on the
right parameters. 

If you can access the machine from the network it will
be best to kill X and access the virtual consoles.

Best,
Girish

Check out auto-props, which is a client-side configuration (
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.2/svn.advanced.props.html#svn.advanced.props.auto
).
It is possible to set the mime-type at import or add time. Set up auto-props
first, though.

There was a proposal for adding server-side configuration as well. From a
quick look at the CHANGES file (
http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/CHANGES), it doesn't seem to have been
implemented yet. But confirm by asking on the svn-users mailing list or IRC
(#svn on freenode). Folks are friendly, if a bit terse.

Is there some way svn can automatically pickup file mode, user and

There is a branch and a patch to handle this last year, not sure if it got
into the general distribution. This email talks about it a little:
http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2005-12/0285.shtml

Note that if you control the working copies area for all the users, much of
this can be done as part of the project configuration. In that case,
Subversion simply uses whatever usernames and groups are already present in
the environment/filesystem.

If you are only worried about execute permission, set svn:executable on
those files or auto-props for regexes that match those filenames.

The primary issue with Subversion and binary files is the client-side
on-disk checkout version copy. It makes offline working trivial, but
increases the network transfer times. As of 1+ years back, svn developers
and power users didn't recommend it for storing large numbers of large
images. That said, Connectiva, IIRC, said it had all its production distros
in Subversion (ISO's, I presume).

You can run xf86cfg in text mode also. Better know about your card, monitor,
etc. before doing this.

That is very good news. On separate partitions? Was
that on an x86 box with IDE disks? What are the
distros? 

Did you create logical partitions and boot linux from
them? Apparently linux can boot off a logical
partition but I think many OSes cannot. 

What is the boot manager you used? 

I was told that gag.sourceforge.net could do it. Did
you use grub?

Thanks.

I have these installed in my laptop,
1) Freespire
2) Linspire
3) Yoper

Grub Bootloader from Freespire is the main.

One partition would be free for remastering Yoper and building the ISO.

I was very impressed with Gopalrathanam's Javascript talk last weekend.

Given sufficient interest, I would like to extend this a bit further and
volunteer to talk about how modern scripting languages are designed
and implemented.

Focus is on 3 areas:
  1. data types, introspection, memory and garbage collection.
  2. symbol tables, namespaces, lexical and dynamic scopes
  3. and end up with how 1,2 are used to implement closures and OO.

All this is primarily based on Perl (ofcourse!), but the most part should
equally well apply to Tcl, Python, Ruby, and (from what I found out
last week) Javascript.

Please let me know if you find this interesting...

I too have the same problem. I use SuSE 10.0. X is configured properly
(init 5). But I am not able switch back to normal terminals (Ctrl +
Alt + F1 - F6). and I am also unable to switch back to X. Mingetty is

I had faced a similar problem on my Sarge(2.6.8) some time back.I have
a hda-intel soundcard and it was not supported out of the box.I
downloaded the drivers and other required tools(libs/utils etc) from
the http://www.alsa-project.org/ site.I built the driver for my card
against the kernel source and it was up and running.
I would suggest you to check the list of supported soundcard's at the
alsa site and the corresponding driver required.If the driver
exists,insert it,else follow the same procedure as mentioned
above.Googling will also provide a lot of info.

Hi,

I was looking for a better tool for the job that
procmail does,e-mail processing/filtering. 

I am more interested in advanced use of vacation
rules, email automation and other interesting stuff.

Any of u know a more user friendly tool that is free?

Thanks in advance for your inputs!

Sorry I really have no idea what SCIM is. Looks like
it is some input method framework or something. What
are you trying to do and what specific problem are you
facing? 

If you guide us a lil bit about what your problem is
we could go further.

Just saying 'doesnt work' doesn't help especially
since I have no idea what SCIM is. :-)

You may find these useful, though I haven't used anything other than

Glad to note that there are more capable people who
can help you.

Can some good samaritan come forward and write a
simple, down to earth Howto on enabling and using
Tamil input and fonts in linux? 

I have been wanting to enter Tamil for quite some time
now. 

Please help as I am lost!

hi,

no apologies for not tagging this as [commercial][OT] because it is  
not. NRC-FOSS at AU-KBC, MIT campus, Anna University Chennai is a  
project funded by the DIT for the pupose of development of FOSS in  
India. In addition to propagation of FOSS, we are now trying to build  
a world standard academic and research programme centred round FOSS.  
Backed by proven expertise of the AU-KBC centre in the fields of  
mathematics, cryptography, pattern recognition, life-sciences,  
wireless and bio-informatics, we are building certificate, diploma  
and postgraduate programmes centred around FOSS on one side and  
building and releasing FOSS applications in these fields on the other  
side. We invite interested people to join us. Details of the posts  
are at:

No, we dont offer multinational salaries. Yes, we believe in academic  
freedom, a relaxed atmosphere, 24/7 working labs and offices, no  
dress code, intellectual stimulation. (And, yes, again, this *is*  
happening in a Govt of India Project). Our goal is to produce FOSS

Message-ID: <9d0602eb0608102335q513f23ccw91a5f62ba417b852@mail.gmail.com>

Issue VIII - 10 August 2006

We are provide to announce the release of LDTP 0.5.0. This release
features number of important breakthroughs in the history of LDTP as
well as in the field of Test Automation. This release note covers a
brief introduction on LDTP followed by the list of new features and
major bug fixes which makes this new version of LDTP the best of the
breed. Useful references have been included at the end of this article
for those who wish to hack / use LDTP.

LDTP developers had the privilege of participating in the Google Summer
of Code contest. Special thanks to the mentors of LDTP in the event
Varadhan and Emily Chen. We also thank Prashanth Mohan ('Casanova') for
his wonderful contributions acting as student developer for LDTP as part
of this event.

LDTP Planet has been set up by Prashanth Mohan ('Casanova') for sharing
information more effectively across the community. You can have access
to the planet through the
following link http://ldtp.freedesktop.org/planet/

About LDTP
==========

Linux Desktop Testing Project is aimed at producing high quality test
automation framework and cutting-edge tools that can be used to test
Linux Desktop and improve it. It uses the Accessibility libraries to
poke through the application's user interface. The framework also has
tools to record test-cases based on user events in the interface of the
application which is under testing. We strive to help in building a
quality desktop.

Whats new in this release...
============================

+ Recording using LDTP
This new version of LDTP features a recorder tool which would help in
generating automation scripts automatically by recording user events.
This would greatly reduce the time required for creating and maintaining
automation scripts. Thanks to Venkateswaran ('whacko'), Harishankaran
('sp2hari') and Theyagarajan ('Taggy') for making this happen. For more

Hi,
I live in Neelankarai and looking for a broadband connection.
My basic requirement is Online video conferencing in day time(10 am to 2pm).
Which connection will suit best to fulfill it?
Pls consider free download(or low charges for each MB download) and 
monthly charges too.
Somebody told me for Airtel/BSNL. But i don't have enough info about it.
 From where can i get these info and whether they are providing 
connection at my location.
What are extra charges?
If any body have the answers, pls reply along with respective contect no 
or address, if he has,
so that i can approach to it.

Thanks in advance.

You can read my and other ppl's reviews at
mouthshut.com. Very good site for figuring out what
ppl feel about goods and services. 

I have a BSNL unlimited broadband connection. I
purchased annual plan by paying a flat 10k ; so now I
never have to bother about paying for Internet. 

I get very good throughput and stability. In fact I
can't ask for anything better. My dl speed is 280 kbps
though it is supposed to be only 256 kbps. I have no
clue how I am getting more than what I paid for. :-)

My upload however is a paltry 64 kbps, that too it the
upper limit. Typical trouble with all ADSL providers.
So it will definitely affect ur ability to
videoconference. It does affect VoIP a bit but I am
sure it is gonna hit u for videoconferencing. 

HTH,
Girish

I have Tata Indicomm 128 KBPS unlimited upload/download limit. The
connection is good and reliable. Earlier days, there was a compliant that
the Tata Indicomm Customer Support is very bad, but now it is better and its
getting better. I got a problem solved with great enthusiasm showed by them.
As far as the connection, its good and well supported by all Linux distros
since its a router based ethernet connection. You are given a static router
ip connection.

The unlimited traffic plans from Touchtel and Tataindicom DSL
offer symmetric 256kbps up and down links.

In all, I recommend Touchtel because their call center staff
are clued in and well mannered.

Btw, TCP is not designed for async bandwidth links, and unless you
implement some QoS to prioritize ACK packets, during heavy uploads
your downloads will suffer.  Eg. On a 2mbps down 512kbps up connection,
running an upload will reduce the download speed to 600-800kbps.

Can someone update me with the plan for this week end. I guess we have a
meet at ELCOT as usual and one more talk at IIT by Raja on Java
Scripting. 
Can someone update the timings and exact venue for all the events over
this week end.  I will be in for both the meets this week end. 

Do we have a python meet at AUKBC ? 

Thanks

No you cannot do it. If you want to play around with a linux mobile, you
should buy a motorolla A- series mobile. It runs linux.  AFAIK nokia

I have absolutely no idea as to what hardware you are
using. 

Whichever is your display, framebuffer/VGA, study the
driver first, and then see how it is used.

when you install a software using rpm or deb u are just copying the
binaries to the specific place without compiling them. This is more
similar to make install. This is has the limitation that you cannot use
a binary for windows in linux or the other way. And a binary built in 64
bit will not work in 32 bit. 

Where as when you get source and do make, make install you actually
compile the source from scratch. 

./configure actually scans your system to find out if all the
requirements for your software are satisfied by your system. 

make compiles the source and creates binaries.
make install copies the binary files and other files to appropriate
place. 

If you want to get a better picture about ./configure , make and make
install you must google for "auto tools". Automake and autoconf are two
important packages used to automate the creation of configure script and
makefiles. 

Hope I answered you question

will tell you all machines up in 10.x.x.x network. It will take a long
time though. 
You can also ping to broadcast ip.

first you must get the port number the host uses
then try to make a connection on each host to that port number
start from 198.58.0.1 till the last in the series
sore every ip from which you get a response
and that list will be the currently live hosts.

  Dear Amit,
   
  A simple script can do the trick ..initialise two varables x and y..run it in a nested 'for' loop,  increment for x and y ...run the ping command (ping 198.58.x.y) and store the output in a text file.I have tried it out(in windows scripting though !!!)...its reasonably faster too..
   
  If you want information on which ports are open then you need to go for tools like nmap or superscan(which is much faster than nmap and gives a good graphical output)...
   
  Thanks and regards

./configure uses the autoconf framework and it works
in conjunction with other "autotools" like automake,
autoconf, libtool , aclocal etc...

Well the above is not strictly true in all cases but
we can assume that in most cases it is true. There are
configure scripts that don't rely on these things
also. Mplayer's configure for instance.

Fundamentally the configure, make , make install cycle
is used for discovering the POSIX compatibility,
building the package with the appropriate compiler,
linker and other flags, linking against the
appropriate libraries, using the appropriate POSIX
facilities avaialle etc.. and finally installing the
binaries, man pages, config files etc. necessary for
the program to work smoothly. 

So the job of configure script is very critical bcoz
though there are a dozen variants of UNIX out there,
you can never be sure what to assume and what not to
for the program to compile and link. 

Many ppl have crticized the overly complex autoconf
framework and most of the time it checks certain basic
things that are available on all UNICes. And sometimes
there are three levels of Makefiles also. Makefile.am
from which Makefile.in and finally Makefile. 

All these lead to tremendous and unwarranted
complexity just for the sake of a lil bit of
portability.

Now, make just recursively traverses down the source
tree and builds the source one after another. If you
have no errors, it is time to do make install. 

make install copies the executables and man pages and
other things like libraries and config files to the
standard locations. 

Contrast this against installing binary packages like
RPM or DEB. 

First of all they are not optimised for your
architecture. Well, they are built with optimisation
flags that run on the same arch but not necessarily
with the highest optimisation that your particular CPU
variant can give. 

That is why you have distros like Gentoo that help you
build your entire OS from source thus getting the
maximum performance. 

Leaving that apart, RPM and DEB have certain rules
about how to package a program. They are also
compressed and they take care of dependencies. 

Unless you obtain an RPM or DEB from an official
source of the distro itself I usually stay well clear
of installing my own RPM or DEB. 

Installing from source with the configure,make cycle
is usually trouble free.

But distros discourage you from doing so if the same
program is available in their package respos since
there is no dependency tracking for packages installed
from source. For instance, in many cases you can't
uninstall cleanly.

FreeBSD gives you both options, building from source
thro' the /usr/ports tree as well as use the pkg_
tools and install binary packages.

Deepan,

Why don't you compile one yourself? 

Seems to be the best solution. Also it will be lean
and mean and fast . After I compiled my firefox just
for fun I am able to now run any number of Tabs and it
never crashes. It is really fast even on my rusty old
machine. 

The instructions are here, I suggested a few changes
since they didn't work perfectly for me but the author
didn't accept my inputs. Anyway should you have any
problems let us know. 

http://linux-sxs.org/internet_browsing/firefox_from_source.html

The specific problems I faced were 
1) I had to create a directory manually
2) I had to run ldconfig after adding the
/usr/firefox-1.5/lib or something to /etc/ld.so.conf
3) I had to nuke the ./mozilla dir under my ~ to get
it working for me. 

Hope this helps,
Girish

Subject: [Ilugc] Bonding and Duplex settings problem
Message-ID: <20060812035533.83429.qmail@web36702.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,
I have two queries.
One:
I had setup bonding in RHEL 3 using 2 interface
connected to the same switch. I had given the bonding
settings in /etc/modules.conf
alias bond0 bonding
 options bond0 miimonfiltered=100 mode=1
 
It is working fine for failover setup (mode=1), but I
want it for load balancing. If I change to load
balance and failover setup (mode=0), I am getting
packet drops, if I do a ping test. How to do load
balance and failover setup, any suggestion. Should I
have to do any configuration in the switch level for
the two ports.
 
Two:
My two 100Mbps ethernet are showing "Half Duplex", in
the ethtool command. I changed to to full duplex using
ethtool
#ethtool -s eth0 autoneg off speed 100 duplex full
#ethtool -s eth1 autoneg off speed 100 duplex full
It is now changing to full duplex. But after restart
of the server, it is reverting to half duplex. In the
switch level, the port has been set to full duplex.
What should be done for the changes to be made permanent.

First of all I don't have experience doing what you
are doing , so very likely I am wrong. However I have
done something similar; so I can give you some
pointers.

I don't understand what you mean by load balancing? Do
you mean link aggregation? As I figured out that is
what is often implied by channel bonding. For
instance, if you have two separate links with
bandwidth 1 MBps each , then by bonding the two
together you can achieve  2 MBps throughput. This was
my understanding of channel bonding. Kindly correct me
if I am wrong. 

If that is indeed the case, then I am even more
confused how come you are getting packet drops in a
simple ping scenario since ping hardly stresses the
network card or even the network. You should never get
dropped packets while pinging inside the network. 

Or by any chance are you running stress tools like
sing or fping or whatever?

Sorry but I think you should not be telling the kernel
whether your card is full duplex or half duplex. The
kernel should figure that out by its own probing
mechanism. Maybe this is why you are getting dropped
packets? 

Hope my inputs help you investigate further.

I  tried  installing RHEL4,Suse10.1 on this machine and was a failure.
It boots from the CD and when i strike the enter key it reboots.And I
was able to install ubuntu 6.06 with grub as the boot loader.But when
i tries to boot ubuntu it reboots at that moment.

Dear friends:
I visited IFET College yesterday -- apart from inaugurating Compass,
their computer science association, delivered a talk -- on FOSS, of
course. The current final year students have already taken FOSS
Elective during the last semester (18 of the 20 cleared the paper).
Their HOD, Ms. Nirmala has been striving hard to keep the FOSS spirit
alive.

My talk centered on
a) FOSS Elective (it is one of our mandatory action item)
b) Student project initiatives -- including our Student Fellowship program
c) FOSS for other departments like Mech, ECE, etc. -- the respective
HoDs were keen to know more on this.
d) employment opportunities (with liberal quotes from the offers that
come in ILUG-C)

They are keen on one-day workshop -- preferably on 26th. The idea is
to take about 4-6 students from CSE, IT, Mech, ECE and EEE, totalling
around 30. HoD and one more lecturer are into FOSS already. Another
3-4 lecturers could join the training. I have suggested that the
workshop could start with the formation of a local LUG group. The
follow up actions could be in the form of projects, LDD, etc. The Vice
Principal (my ex-colleague at Arunai) and a few others are keen on
Tamil Language contributions.

I hope  Antano Solar John <solar345@hotmail.com> is still available.
Would like to receive responses from others (including suggestion
about date for workshop).
With best wishes, Srinivasan.

Adharsh, since you say the system reboots on pressing return, it must be an ACPI problem afaik. Try adding this to the grub menu

1. Press Esc when grub loads
2. Select the kernel entry and edit it by pressing e
3. To the second line of the entry add "acpi=off" after root=
    Eg: kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-23-386 root=/dev/hda1 acpi=off ro quiet splash
4. By most chance, if it is an ACPI problem, the system will boot by this edit
5. After booting and logging in edit the grub entries
    a) Open Terminal from Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal
    b) Type sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
    c) The password system asks for is your password (The Logged in user's)
    d) Search for the kernel entry in the file and add the above acpi=off to it.
    e)Save the file and reboot.

PS: I have pasted my menu.lst at pastebin.de. The link is http://pastebin.de/10675

Dear Girish,
For my 1st query you mean the same. I am doing link
aggrigation only. But as i mentioned, if I put the
channel bonding in load balancing and fault tolerant
mode, I am getting packet drops. But in fault tolerant
only mode, the ping is normal.

In my 2nd query, I had setup the link aggrigation only
after changing the duplex setting of both the
interface to FULL.

What switch do you have at the other end of the links? Yes, you
certainly will have to configure the switch ports for load balancing
over multiple NICs. Cisco switches running IOS supports this feature
(not sure of CatOS).

Your ping test failing is understandable; the switch is confused
because your server MAC appears on several ports ("flapping").

Don't bother. half duplex is what has been negotiated as the best link
for your network. Leave it as it is.

Not too sure if ping failure is deemed ok either due
to flapping or whatever else. Since if your idea is
link aggregation then this will leave you worse off
than having a single ethernet card. 

Also I am wondering what you mean by server MAC. Since
MAC is stored on the NIC and it will be different for
each ethernet card. Also MAC can be changed with the
ifconfig command in many cases.

So I am sure you should be able to get rid of the
problem somehow though I wonder how. :-)

I am guessing that when the machine boots, the
ethernet card neogiates something with the hub/switch
and the kernel gets to know the card capabilites thro'
that. Since I have always observed that when I boot
the first thing that happens is the LED on the
hub/switch starts glowing... I am sure this happens
even before the OS gets loaded. So this is done by
BIOS either on the motherboard or on the NIC...

I had tried this time with two switches in load
balancing mode (mode=0), but still I am facing
problem. This time there is delay in the packet beign
received is more (not too high, but more than what I
receive in mode=1) and few packet drops. But i should
get more performance in mode 0 than in mode=1 as there
are two links working ? the destination which I ping
is a Solaris machine that is using Solaris IPMP with
load balancing.

Well, when you bond together multiple interfaces using the Linux
bonding driver, the resultant bond0 interface gets the MAC of the
first slave interface (typically, eth0). For bonding to work in high
availability mode, the active interface presents the bonded
interface's MAC (remember that the active interface could be any of
the slaves) to ARP negotiations. If the interface currently active
changes for any reason (link failure), then the MAC automatically
switches over to the new, active slave.

Similarly, when multiple interfaces are bonded together in
load-balanced fashion, each of the participating interfaces present
the same MAC (that of the first slave) to the peer device. If the peer
device is not expecting this behaviour, chaos can result (Cisco
switches just shutdown the ports concerned after logging a "flapping"
message).

If you try to ifconfig bond0 to a new MAC, then all the slaves with
get this new MAC - you won't solve the basic problem.

The NIC itself. The NIC's driver can then query the NIC for the
results of these negotiations.

Depends on how you define performance. If you are in load-balanced
mode with correctly configured switches, you will certainly see double
the throughput of one interface. The latency will remain more or less
the same, though.

In high availability mode, theoretically you can pull the cable out of
the active interface and your server should still be live on the
network without a blink (you might lose one ping packet).

Which kernel are you running on RHEL? Later versions of RHEL3 have
several bug fixes in the bonding driver - I have seen very visible
improvements in NIC bonding over successive updates.

Lastly, decide which one you want - load-balancing or high
availability. In most cases, you only need high-availability -
load-balancing/sharing ought to be a design issue only if you expect
your server to push more data than the capacity of one NIC.

If you really want load-balancing, then you should ask your network
administrator to create an etherchannel or trunk for your server
(depending on the switch model and IOS version, I think).

Hello/Vanakam?

This is pretty far off topic, but I figure that touching base with the
linux folks I will be around is a good thing. So, thanks in advance
for any advice.

I am an American living in Atlanta GA USA planning to move to Chennai
(Manapakkam) in jan. 07... I have (and will have) a number of
questions about getting there getting settled, jobs, cost of living,
state of linux and open source there... I am currently a member of ALE
(altanta linux ethuthiast) and do a mix of perl programming, system
admin. and build/release/source code management of a network security
company here in Atlanta...

questions
what is a reasonable salary to expect?
what is the minimum amount of money in dollars i should bring to get
settled (have a wife and 2 small kids)... If anyone has a sample
budget they are willing to share that would be great...
does anyone know of full house filter systems (or what is the best
method for purifying water?)
cost of living? (2-3 bedroom apartment, transportation, food, utilities.....)

this is at least a start....Thanks very much, it looks like you guys
have a great group...I hope to see you soon!

Thanks/Nandri

The salary mainly depends on you experience.
These days fresh gradutates are starting with salaries like 2 - 3 lacks
p.a. (or maybe even more)

And how much is enough depends very much on the person.

That depends a lot on the locatlity. 
Rent could be around Rs 10,000 p.m  - 3,000 p.m depending on the
locality.
I dont know much about water purification. But, you get things like aqua
guard
with costs a few thousand rupees .. not very sure about the price
though.

Just curious, If you dont mind, Why do you want to move to chennai from
USA?

Far cheaper when you translate it to USD - but do remember that local 
salaries are far smaller here (you could earn as much for an entry -- 
mid leve software job here - looking at a straight rupee - dollar 
conversion - flipping burgers at a McDs stateside ..)  [purchasing power 
parity does make a difference though]

Do you already have a job here?  Or you'd have to go hunt for work visas 
and such first.  [and hunt for a job before that, I'd guess]

Dear Lyric,

First off a hearty welcome to you! 

Ppl often speak of a culture shock especially in the
US context since fundamentally America represents the
active West and India represents the contemplative
East! 

So please please come prepared. There are going to be
several things you will find outright stupid or silly
or meaningless. 

By the same token we may also feel that way once we go
to USA.

But over time everything will be clear to you and
things will fall in place slowly and surely. 

So my first advice to you will be to be open minded
and take things in your stride. 

Chennai as a city has got a rich culture and tradition
and is very much representative of the Indian psyche. 

However that said, it does take some time for a new
comer to feel comfy with the city. 

Bcoz what you see outside is not what is inside and as
time progresses you will like the city more and
more...

Coming the state of linux and open source, I am sure
others can give you much more info as I am really not
quite clued in. 

However my two cents will be that things looks very
vibrant and positive now! 

There is lot of perl and sys adm work going on now.

> 
> questions
> what is a reasonable salary to expect?

Well, if what you are describing is a sysadm job then
I am afraid I am not the right guy to comment. Already
Suresh has given you certain figures which should be
somewhat accurate. 

However you should be able to do moonlighting and
consulting and make a lil bit of money. But be warned
that the market here is not so mature that you will
find that easy. I may be wrong here; pls someone
correct me!

India has proven to the world how little a man can
have and still live happily. You wouldn't be surprised
to see folks here having just a morsel of food a day
and still be smiling and happy. 

Anyway jokes apart my advice to you will be to bring a
few thousand dollars liquid cash to take care of daily
expenses and use your credit card for other things.

> what is the best
> method for purifying water?)

You do get Aquaguard water filter for around 5 to 8k
rupees( less than 200$) that do a pretty good job of
filtering water. 

> cost of living? (2-3 bedroom apartment,
> transportation, food, utilities.....)

Ah! Never ask ! You have the entire spectrum here. 

Acco is never a problem though you may run into ethnic
issues. However posh localities with a sea view can
easily be had if you are willing to spend a few bucks
more. :-)

Transportation is quite good here by Indian standards
and even by Califorina standards. US is pretty bad
when it comes to public transport though I know not
about Atlanta in particular. 

However buses are often crowded, you find it hard to
stand even sometimes and with the hot climate here ,
you get out all sweating and worn out. 

Also buses do account for some time loss and
inconvenience anyway , so you cannot rely on them
completely.

The suburban railway here however is top class, close
to being the best in the country. Trains are not as
crowded as buses and the railway network is quite well
designed though there is scope for improvement of
course. Several places in Chennai still don't enjoy
proper train connectivity.

You can easily buy a good small car here by spending
7000$ and you can get yourself a BMW or Merc if you
prefer for a much higher price of course. :-)

Again, you have a choice. You decide.

Looking fwd to seeing you soon too!

Lastly I want to reiterate the fact that India is a
very different country and it is an ancient and deep
culture. Such multi ethnicity and diversity in
everything you cannot find in any nation on earth. 

And Tamil culture in particular is also very ancient
with rich and colorful traditions. So please come
prepared for something completely different. 

Difference always is somewhat painful for the brain. 

That is the only thing I want to point out. 

Yes, our group is always there by your side to support
you and guide you. 

All the best!

Message-ID: <809586140608130226k39640e4ag3be2c51a67f38ae2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a doubt regarding the current web standars.

Why can't Amaya (as a editor and browser) be developed as a reference
implementation of latest Web Standards (XHTML, CSS etc) from which
other browsers (Firefox, Opera, IE & Others) can follow. Why is W3C
not strict about its members not following proper Web Standards? Why
is W3C not caring about this? If browser vendors has to follow the
latest Web Standards then W3C should be strict as in XHTML Strict.

Why can't this happen?
Why can't the Web Standards be brought in line like the J2EE
Standards. In which the J2EE standards are devised by the JCP and the
JCP provides a reference implementation of the standard which is
followed by the Vendors. W3C can also provide such reference
implementation (in form of Amaya). W3C can also provide compitability
certificates as done in J2EE World. Only browsers that carry the W3C
mark can sustain in the browser market as done in the J2EE world.

Since, Amaya is already an Open Source project it is possible to make
it as a reference implementation of the current Web Standard. W3C
should be open and should always provide Open Standards. W3C should
have members from the Open Souce communities to make the Web Standard
a real standard.

I don't understand why W3C has deviced so many version of a Web
Standard before the previous one gets matured. If this is the rate at
which web technologies are developed why don't it be released in a
phased manner (Alpha,Beta,Stable) as done in Software Industry.

When will a web developer get a good soluuon for the current Web Standards?

u cud get in touch with iit or one of tenet companies
like midas or banyan. they do quite a bit of hardware
work though i doubt if they do any work on avr
microcontrollers. 

u cud mail to rtm@banyannetworks.com or

Dont be silly - its a linux server, how's it going to get infected with 
windows viruses?

Viruses typically forge any random from address they find (for example, 
in the outlook inbox of an infected PC) into the from address of spam / 
viruses that an infected PC sends out

So someone reads ilugc on a windows pc, that's infected.

i purchased an O2 XDA II mini , used it for a month and resold it last
week; its uncomfortable to use as a mobile phone. But, my main
requirement of contacts/schedules/appointments was well met cos the
synchronization with my laptop was excellent; i would like to try out
a linux mobile now. I am consulting my friends in this list. Can
someone suggest a good linux PDA which can sync well with my
laptop?(addresses/contacts/tel numbers/appointments/schedules/todos
mainly, some mp3 music of course). Any experiences may kindly be
shared.

You'll feel right at home about some things.

Madras is just as hot, sticky and humid as Atlanta is - and the local 
mosquitoes are good competition for the ones in ATL.  I must admit that 
your palmetto bugs do tend to be rather larger and uglier than the local 
competition

For those who haven't seen these critters (Periplaneta americana aka the 
Palmetto bug) yet, I would suggest not going within several miles of 
Atlanta, Savannah, Tampa .. hell, anywhere in Georgia or Florida.

Here's a pic or two to satisfy your curiosity

our repository and the upstream servers (i just checked against the debian

The problem is/(seems to be) solved now. Earlier, the Packages files
were actually older than the actual packages themselves, which
resulted in "missing" older packages. Now, the Packages file seems to
be in sync (newer, in most cases) than the packages themselves. So, I
think the problem is fixed.

Thanks.

If I remember correctly, Solaris IPMP (at least, up to Solaris 9)
provides only for fault tolerance (high availability) and not load
balancing. Its principle of operation is quite different from that of
the Linux bonding driver - it requires individual IP addresses for all
participating interfaces, as well as what is known as a floating IP
address. It is somewhat similar to VRRP or HSRP/NSRP/several other
proprietary protocols.

Lastly, using the bonding driver for load balancing doesn't make much
sense. Does your server generate so much traffic that it exceeds the
capacity of one link? Are all the devices in the path of this traffic
(including the recipient station) capable of handling such traffic? If
you answer "no" to either of these questions, you don't need load
balancing. My personal experience is that under such high load
conditions, what hurts first is CPU power on the server, memory,

I was as baffled (more but not less ) than the others who had posted their replies. The question itself did not seem to be clear.What is a & b?And if 'a' and 'b' was some macro or a numeric value,it would create what is called a "anonymous structure" as pointed out by "keith thomposon". I am still in the dark about this "anonymous structure". 

However this post led me to an intrsting topic of "structure  alignment & internal padding" http://www.c-faq.com/struct/padding.htm
Also related to this is the issue of structure alignment http://www.c-faq.com/struct/align.html

The question is still though unanswered.

A normal struct would look like:

struct foo {
   int something;
   char something_else;
};

And then you can have:

struct foo hello, world;
struct foo *fooptr = hello;

And so on, wherever you want.

An anomymous structure is one that omits the name for the structure;
here foo. It is useful only for one declaration:

struct {
   int something;
   char somethingelse;
} hello, world;

If you at a later time need another of these structs, you need to
define the struct all over again (for example, the fooptr above). It
is a valid C structure, but its usefulness is dubious. It is so much
easier to follow the first version so as to maintain the structure
definition in one place.

> The question is still though unanswered.

What is the question about the original struct?

I forgot to mention that anonymous structures are used mostly to
define new types via typedefs, like:

typedef struct {
    int something;
    char something_else;
} mystruct_t;

And then:

mystruct_t hello, world;
mystruct_t *fooptr;

etc.

Or multiple disks on the same server initially, if the load is disk I/O 
rather than CPU

vmstat, iostat and such are your friends there

bit fields are expressed this way

int a : 3 or something like that .............

or could be int : 3 ;
so here


int:a;
int:b;

means int:somenumeric value

so a and b are something like real constants ... maybe  macros !!!

and u said the total size is 12

so that maens double(8) + char(1) + int:a + int:b = 12
so a+b = 3 bytes  = 24 bits
the macro values of a and b are such that a+b = 24 :)

This struct

struct x
{
char a;
int b;
};

would be 8 bytes in size(due to padding). 
I am just guessing that the compiler would internally convert this to

struct
{
char a:8;
int:24;
int b;
};

(Try compiling this, you will get an 8 byte structure)

You cant access those 24 bits bcos they are unnamed. 
(ofcourse you could use casts to get to those bytes, but thats not what
we are discussing here)

Mohammed Riyaz

Message-ID: <1cd7e030608140019s2ada5b24m5553d1d513eaefa2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys
We are building our custom messaging application on centos 4.2 with
postfix+ms+sa+jabber. We create our own ISO cd with only the required rpm
packages and send it to clients for installation.

Current status : After the installation we compile a new kernel with
reiserfs support build in and boot into it for migrating an existing
partition in ext3 to reiserfs.  we have added unsupported kernel (from
centos plus packages) & reiserfs-utils rpm's to the install cd which has
reiserfs support by default in it so that we dont have to rebuild the kernel
after install.The current centos CD-boot image does not supports reiserfs
and we need to create reiserfs support during the installation itself. Does
anybody has any idea how do i create an boot image which can support
reiserfs during the installation itself.

You create your own "centos" ISO image and replace
centOS supplied kernel with your reiserfs enabled
kernel. That way you can avoid having to add rpms for
that. 

You have to remaster the ISO. First mount the centOS
iso.

#mount -o loop <cent-os.iso> /mnt
# cd /mnt

Now I don't know the way cent OS stores its kernel.
You have to figure that out. A simple way is to do a
file command recursively and grep for x86 boot sector.


But this doesn't always work. You may be lucky, who
knows? :-)

Or else the kernel may be named vmliuz .

Anyway make sure you build reiserfs into the kernel
and just replace the kernel. 

#umount /cdrom

Burn the CD and you are done!

HTH,
Girish

Thanks for the reply Girish, i think i need to be more clear on boot kernel
part. We need to make the  boot kernel in the CD itslef to support reiserfs.
I have replaced the kernel in the centos Boot CD but that supports reiserfs
only after the installation. We need reiserfs during the installation not
after the installation.

I guess now my point is much more clear pal :D

No I understood you perfectly first time itself.
Follow my instructions and you will get what you want.
:-)

I just figured out there is a file called isolinux.cfg
in the CD. I think it should be there in your CD also.
Locate that file, figure out where it is picking up
the kernel from. 

And replace that kernel and burn the ISO. 

I really don't think I can be any clearer than now.

I tried it dude, but it gives errors about the missing system from which i
have copied the vmlinuz and inirtd.img file. I copied them from a test
system on which reiserfs support is buildin to the kernel.

At what point are you getting the error message? After
booting the ISO? Or sometime before?

Why don't you copy paste the exact text of the error
message? Who is giving the message?

FLOSSAGE?O6 ? LINUX DEMO DAY 

JAYA ENGINEERING COLLEGE

 

 

The Linux Campus Club, Jaya
Engineering College in association with NRCFOSS (The National Resource Centre
for FOSS) and ILUGC (Indian Linux User Group Chennai) will be conducting a
2-day exhibition-cum-seminar, FLOSSAGE?06, Linux Demo Day, on innovative and
informative concepts related to Free and Open Source Software. It is scheduled
on the 19th and 20th of August between 10a.m. and 5p.m.
at the college premises. 

 

Free Software, refers to software
distributed in source form which can be freely modified and redistributed. Open
Source refers to the fact that the source code of Free Software is open to the
world to use, modify and reuse. Free Software is a matter of liberty and not
price. It offers the users, freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and
improve the software. FOSS gives the users the same freedom and opportunities
enjoyed by the developer of the original source code. In developing countries
like India, FOSS distributions has cost-effective deployment of IT
infrastructure. FOSS provides access to excellent primary sources of learning
material for students and has been one of the major reasons for the exponential
growth of Internet, especially in developing countries. Moreover, FOSS allows
tomorrow?s experts and information technology leaders to acquire adequate
competency skills and advance their knowledge rapidly.

 

Further, Jaya Engineering College
has been taking part in various activities of the NRCFOSS and ILUGC for
promoting FOSS. The college has a well equipped FOSS LAB with over 50 computers
installed with different free softwares and operating systems. The students are
allowed to use the lab during free time and make use of these resources in a
productive manner. Moreover, Jaya Engineering College is one of the few
colleges affiliated to Anna University that is offering FOSS-I and Enterprise
Application Development using FOSS as electives for the third and final year
students respectively. The student community also extend their active
participation in various activities by forming a Linux Campus Club, organizing several
events through the club and attending FOSS exhibitions conducted by other technical
institutions. As yet another step for promoting FOSS, the institution has decided
to conduct this 2-day exhibition and seminar christened FLOSSAGE?06. This
exhibition is purely related to free and open softwares. There are about 25 exhibits
on various topics of FOSS. The programme also includes a number of seminars
that are to be delivered by delegates from industries, distinguished members of
the ILUGC and NRCFOSS. The Chief Guest, Mr.Atul Anand, I.A.S, Director, e-governance,
Govt.of TamilNadu, will preside over the inaugural function on 19th
August 2006.


The purpose of this exhibition is to
create awareness and inculcate knowledge among the student fraternity,
professionals and the general public on the various concepts, issues and vast
applications of the Free and open Source software. So, it is a great
opportunity for the general public to get acquainted with the latest in open
source technology.

 

The entry for the exhibition is free and
thus anyone with a real passion towards FOSS is invited to come and quench
their thirst of knowledge. For further details, contact- 9444246644, kumaran.ma@gmail.com,&nbsp; hodcse@jec.ac.in

Hai, Thanks for your suggestions. I had setup my
server  with the HA mode only. I tried to pull out the
cable and did all those tests, and the setup is fine.
I am currently using 2.4.21-32.ELsmp kernel.

i still have one more doubt, can I achive Load
balancing for a server, if the NICs are connected to
two different switches. 

Regards,
Anandh G

I have done some goolgling for u.
http://www.linuxcompatible.org/Install_Fedora_Core_4_on_USB_hard_drive_t34055.html

Bear in mind that installation shud be in expert mode
and that ur USB hard drive will be called /dev/sd*
since USB devices work thro' SCSI emulation under
Linux.

If you don't see a drive letter like /dev/sda or
something, then you can be sure you are screwing up
your IDE hard disk. 

Once you make sure that you are indeed installing on
to the USB hard drive and make sure you install grub
on it, then the next step is slightly tricky. 

Don't end up  partitioning the wrong drive!

Another useful tip is to notice the HDD LED blinking.
If you find your IDE HDD LED is blinking happily
instead of your USB HDD , then it is time to call it a
day and get yourself a cup of coffee...

In any case whenever you are installing anything , it
is always better to take full backup. And be prepared
for the worst. 

In spite of installing a dozen times on different
machines and playing with multiple OSes I still get
cold feet when I am installing something new. Bcoz
there are many ways in which you can go wrong. Most of
the time I get it right. 

But as they say,"Better safe than sorry".

How to boot off the external USB hard drive? 

Your BIOS should support it. Go to the boot menu in
the BIOS at startup and look for items like USB-ZIP
and USB-HDD. I am sure your machine will have an entry
for USB-HDD. Select that. 

I have exp booting from USB key drive. I think USB hdd
shud be fairly similar though not quite as straight
forward. 

All the best!

Girish

As far as I know, no.

You can have load balancing if all NICs are on the same switch.

You can have high availability if all NICs are on individual switches
(it eliminates the switch as a single point of failure too).

You cannot have both.

Message-ID: <20060815213151.98454.qmail@web7611.mail.in.yahoo.com>

A Nokia 6600 ,a assembled PC with FC5 and a local made Bluetooth dongle was all that was required to enable me do with my computer what was a small dream even few months back.I could control the music being played on my computer ,even shut it down when i wanted to and all this without even going at least 10 metres near to my computer.  Bemused enabled me do just that with my mobile phone.  The system is basically a client - server. The client side has to be installed on your phone and the server on your PC. After you have installed the bemused client on your phone , you can control music players like XMMS,amarok,etc( on Linux),Winamp and WMP( on Windows). You can even control powerpoint slide shows with your phone.
 
 Download bemused for S60 phones here
 For linux users who have kde-bluetooth installed you only need to install the client side (.sis file) on your phone. The server is bundled with kde-bluetooth.
 
 Windows users will however have to install the bemused server as well.
For details on how "bemused " works visit the project homepage

removes the blank lines and file1.txt has to be affected by this command.

I mean the file1.txt should contain non-empty lines.

Good question. I thought it was not possible but got
to know that this can give u what u want.

$ perl -pi -e 's/^\s$//' file1.txt

Unforunately I am forced to say that perl is
counterintuitive when it comes to certain things...

Even in regexes where it should have been backward
compatible with flex and sed regexes, sometimes things
just don't work as you expect. 

I mean why say /^\s$/ when it is enuf to say /^$/? 

Anyway hope you got what you wanted...

Good. In this particular this gives exactly what you
want.

But in general for generic in place editing and text
munching the "perl -pi" route seems to be the only way
out.

Otherwise it is impossible to do in place editing. You
always need a temporary file...

You can't blame UNIX for that since command line tools
are kept as simple as possible. 

In fact perl goes thro' multiple hoops to give this
effect.

Ever wondered why there is no undelete? Same reason.

But then UNIX is constantly evolving, so things
change...

Sorry I was wrong. The -i flag to sed clearly implies
in place editing.

Pls ignore the reasoning of my previous mail!

Subject: [Ilugc] help regarding to configure a Squid.
Message-ID: <4367206c0608160514g1d60d2fcs63f5af2d34623b10@mail.gmail.com>

hi everybody,
i have newly configured a Squid proxy for my network. i am using a Fedora 5
server. and all of my LAN PCs are RHEL and fedora.

by using Squid, i want to provide a full time access to all the managers and
limited time access to all the employees.
my configuration is as follows,

acl managers src 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.99/255.255.255.255
acl employees src 192.168.0.100-192.168.0.200/255.255.255.255
acl mornings time 08:00-12:00
acl night time 20:00-22:00

http_access allow managers
http_access allow employees mornings night

1) when i put 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.99/24, it is shown an error.
   one of my friend suggested me to put /255.255.255.255 instead of
/24,after that my problem got solved.
   i want to know what is the difference? and why /24 settings not working?
(he also doesn't know WHY)

NOW the squid is working FINE. but i am facing a problem while configuring a
ACL TIME settings.

All the machines those having a IP range below 100 (ie, 192.168.0.1 - 99)
are working fine. but the other clients could not get connected. and saying
an error ( Access Denied - acl is not allowed to connect this time) and at
the bottom of tht page, it shows a wrong time.
(in the SQUID server i have configured a IST +5.30 format.and its showing a
correct time on the sever)
but in the client machine's error page it shows a wrong time. i have changed
my clock settings many time.
when i post this message, my squid server's time is 5:10 PM. but in the
client's error page it shows 11:40 AM GMT (is it UTC?)

2) is Squid uses a time format from the system clock?
3) why Squid is showing a Different Time in the Error Page.
4) Is my configuration Correct?

thanks in advance.

Yes, but the "-i" option in sed is non standard and is not available on 
all operating systems.

Either Perl works here, or ed(1) can be used.

shell> ed file1.txt
1,$s/^$/d
w
q

If this needs to be written as part of a program, then the following can 
be used:

ed file1.txt <<!
1,$s/^$/d
w
q
!

You got it wrong, probably. /^$/ matches completely empty lines,
/^\s*$/ matches that case as well as lines that are entirely comprised
of whitespace.

Perl regexes are a superset of grep-like regexes and grep -E POSIX
extended regexes - they are called Perl regexes and are far more
powerful that the other types (though resemble modem line noise more
than the other types). Quite a lot of software now support what are
called PCREs - Perl Compatbile Regular Expressions (python/php etc.,
javascript...)

I have always found SquidGuard to be a fast and flexible way to manage
acls in Squid.  I highly recommend using it over the default acl features
that squid provides you.

Try /32 and it should work fine.  Or better, remove the /foo bit and it should
work again.

You can only specify IP ranges two ways:
    1. start_ip-end_ip (eg. 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.99)
    2. ipaddress/netmask (eg. 192.168.0.0/24)

I'm not sure if you use a comma separated list of IP addresses.

If you are using (1), start and end IP must be a single address and cannot
match a entire subnet or multiple IPs.  Using the CIDR mask /24 means the
entire 192.168.0.x subnet.  Note that a netmask of 255.255.255 and it's
equivalent /32 CIDR notation match a single IP address.

Do the following:
    1. ensure that your hardware clock is set to UTC (GMT)
    2. set your timezone appropriately -- Asia/Calcutta should be fine
    3. run "ntpdate pool.ntp.org" hourly to ensure that the system time is
        is always in sync
    4. ensure that the "date" command returns the correct local time
    5. restart squid

it should be

because all the acl taken to be in AND by default. so if morning and

Subject: [Ilugc] [Training]C/C++ Development using Eclipse
Message-ID: <44E400A7.2070000@gmail.com>

Hello Luggies,

We at NRCFOSS have got a request for conducting training  for  C/C++ 
Developers in CRIS (Centre for Railway Information Systems) on C/C++ 
Development using Eclipse IDE. We are looking for someone who can handle 
this. The details of the proposed training session are as follows,

Suggested Course Contents:

1. Getting started with using Eclipse for C/C++ programming
2. Eclipse and CDT plug-in
3. CYGWIN and MINGW
4. wxWifgets
5. Configuring Eclipse to develop and run C/C++ applications
6. Testing the configuration
7. C/C++ Development in Eclipse
8. Running the applications
9. Resources

FAQs:


1. What is the expected duration of the training? 
[Reply] A day or two, I expect. There is no limit to the days. The 
training is not for teaching C/C++. It is for migrating programmers who 
are programming in these languages but today use no IDE.

2. What is the background and number of trainees expected?
[Reply] The number of trainees will be approx 10. They are basically C, 
C++ programmers who do the programming as part of their day to day work.

3. Would this training be  on full time basis (ie, 8hrs a day) , or on
part-time(evening)  class basis?
[Reply] Full time basis.

4. The class/lab would be held at CRIS or at our place?
[Reply] At CRIS, We can provide a training room, with 7-8 PCs and LCD 
Projector

5. What is the training expected to equip the trainees for?
[Reply] The trainees should be able to use Eclipse IDE for C/C++ 
development during their normal work.


People who are interested can contact Mr.Srinivasan - srinivasan@au-kbc.org

Is Mr. Venkatraman an Oracle employee? If yes, why isn't he using an
@oracle.com email address to solicit resumes? The way you post it, I
think he is a placement consultant - you ought to stop shilling for
that sleazy type here.

Use "^V^I", some versions of sed don't understand C-style escape sequences.

So, your command would be:
sed 's/^V<Return>/^V^I/' file

One of my client needs his requirement in the form of a distro and asked us

I think Knoppix and Mepis are good.But am unaware which I have to choose?

Any inputs on this?

Have anybody remastered Mepis?. I just need to have the core (not even X).

Read sed(1).
- p is for printing the output, used in conjunction with -n command line 
option.
- x is for swapping pattern and hold space.

From http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_mono/sed.html#SEC8

`x'
    Exchange the contents of the hold and pattern spaces.
`p'
    Print out the pattern space (to the standard output). This command
    is usually only used in conjunction with the -n command-line option.
    [snip]

So, what this does is, moves a line matching the regex to the hold
space, and puts the contents of the hold space (which is blank) into
the pattern space. Then, it prints out the contents of the current
pattern space, which is the blank line. After this, it again exchanges
the pattern and hold spaces, which causes the line to return to the
pattern space. Finally, since the `-n' option was not specified, the
contents of the pattern space is printed.

I hope this explains it sufficiently. But to read the sed info. It is
an excellent document which will tell you about some awesome stuff
which can be done with sed very simply.

AFAIK no. Bash history is somewhat idiosynchratic.

It doesn't store all commands typed in all ptys...

I think you can configure bash to behave itself though
I don't have the web link handy. 

A little bit of googling can help you avoid this
catastrophe in future but for now I am nearly certain
you can't recover your past commands.

If you think you cannot remember certain commands you
can use this construct.

$cd /usr/share/doc/
Type Control-A
Type "echo"
Redirect it to a file name

For instance, you can store the command in a file
bye

$echo "cd /usr/share/doc" > cd-cmd

Another feature I find useful in bash is the reverse
search a la emacs. Type Control-R. 

In any case it is worth knowing how to expand the
history buffer.

Girish

That is strange. I have never encountered this behaviour. Do you have
any reliable way of replicating this?

The default history size (and stored history file size) is 1000
commands. I usually run several times more than than in a single
session, so I have customized my bash history configuration thus:

export HISTSIZE=50000
export HISTFILESIZE=50000

export command_oriented_history=true

export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth
export HISTIGNORE="ls:l:cd:df:fg:frm:fetchmail:f:eject:mailq:bg"

The first two change the size of, respectively, in-core history buffer
and on-disk history file to 50000 commands (these two are still small
enough for me, since there are times when I wish I had access to a
very complex awk script or something I typed on the command line a few
months ago).

The third line stores multiline commands as a single history entry
(reduces the number of lines).

The fourth line causes bash to ignore these two types of commands:

- Duplicate commands; ie, same command run multiple times in succession.

- Commands that begin with a space. With this, I can manually set a
command not to be logged in history by just prefixing it with a space
(I typically do this for destructive commands like rm -fr, since I
have a tendency to do things like control-R, something, enter without
even looking at what I got).

The last line causes those specific commands not to be logged in history.

You should check this particular job as it is advertised on Oracle's
website (http://irecruitment.oracle.com/ - search for Information
Technology jobs, Bangalore, and then look at IRC787508). You will see
why I have such a low opinion of placement consultants.

What I meant by idiosynchratic is that things don't
work as expected. At least what I expected...

Quite possible my expectations are not as things
should be. 

Assuming that I have five ptys in an X session. I type
different commands in them. Now , I open a new xterm
and then press Control-R. What is supposed to happen?

I should be able to search for all the commands I
typed in the past , right?

This doesn't quite happen. I have not done extensive
research on this but I know several occassions in
which I have found one particularly long command
getting lost. 

You see, I don't use history or reverse search much
but then I do get somewhat miffed at the fact that
when I need it it is not there. 

If I were to design the history mechanism, I would
certainly have made history only time dependent. And
optionally pty or bash instance dependent. 

In which case, if I press C-R at any terminal , new or
existing, I can thumb thro' all the previous commands.

This certainly doesn't happen. 

This is what I meant. 

Maybe I haven't done enough study or configuration.

But bash being so good in all other respects with the
POLA principle, I find this somewhat odd...

regards,
Girish

Well, the history file is written to the disk only at the end of your
session (logout, or control-D, or exit, or click-on-X or whatever).
Newer sessions read history from disk and not via any IPC mechanism.
This is quite likely what your confusion is about?

I am very much an Oracle Employee; I did not give my Corporate ID as I felt that there was a very high chance of getting spammed; and also i use my corp id for business transactions.

Yeah, i could have given the IRC number - missed that!

Nice. Thanks!

I should have guessed that. But there is no reason why
you can't store these things in memory and retrieve
it. A few lines of simple C code can do it. No need
for any "fancy" IPC. Different bash instances could
maintain a shared mem area or some such thing. 

Anyway as a end user I don't get what I want. Hence
the "confusion."

Is there a chance for the history file not to be
written to disk due to a sudden power outage or some
such thing?

Then I hate the fact that it is written only during
normal situations. Maybe this explains why some
commands vanish into thin air.

This can be taken care of by periodically writing to
disk like the emacs auto save feature.

Well, one can argue all this is feature bloat, but
bash is already quite bloated; so nothing wrong in
making it a tad more bloated! :-)

You have just -defined- IPC - mechanisms for different processes to
communicate to each other via memory-based techniques ("Inter-Process
Communication"). Getting it just correct for a given piece of software
is not an easy task.

Well, easy or difficult is purely relative dependent
on one's energy levels and genius. 

Genius is an ability to take infinite pains and with
adequate pains just about anything can be
accomplished. 

In this case however it is not relevant. It is really
simple to do.

First of all let me clarify that we were barking up
the wrong tree. If as per your explanation, the
history is written to disk and read from disk, then
obviously it wouldn't work if you press the up arrow
once you in a shell. I know you didn't mean to say
that.

In any case I am sure this is an area of improvement
for bash and if coded properly GNU should accept the
patch. Too bad I don't have the bandwidth to do it
right now.

Anyway here is the logic for anyone with the necessary
courage and determination. A patch on your resume
wouldn't look too bad, would it? :-)

I have no idea about bash internals but one can guess
reasonably well. 

I think as of now , bash merely stores the command
history in a buffer for each bash process, one for
each pty. Now, all I am saying is that as and when the
user types a certain command in a certain bash
instance, one has to maintain a queue of commands and
each command should get appended to it. One could use
any mechanism to achieve that. 

One simple way would be to have a UNIX domain socket
listen for command lines. Or you could append it to a
file also. After all files are also a very simple and
effective IPC mechanism.

Now, the in core history buffer has to be updated
either from the file or from the socket depending upon
the way you decide to implement it. 

The socket approach has a problem that it has to flush
the queue to a file every now and then. We could use a
setitimer() for that. No need for threads...

Any takers for the patch? :-)

This makes a good student project for those of you
interested in doing something that is going to be used
by others.

However I certainly cannot guarantee that GNU folks
will apply the patch. You never can guess human
psychology.

FWIW this will certainly give you good exposure to
UNIX and to a certain degree programming too...

regards,
Girish

If you work for Oracle, you are not a placement consultant - ergo, it
doesn't apply to you :)

Having dealt with a variety of them over the past several years, I
don't see any reason to change my opinion of them. I am staring at an
obviously doctored resume as I type this (Microsoft Network
Administrator - AD/Exchange etc. - doctored to sound as a Network
Administrator - OSI Layers etc. variety).

I'm not sure if my brain would digest the fact that the "up arrow"
will now show the last command I typed in some other bash window.
I'm not sure how many people's brains will be able to digest it either.

Not to mention the '!' and '^' history expansion characters. I'll be

Btw, if you don't even want X, then you don't want a
liveCD either. :-)

I mean you could do with a dsl on a USB key or
something. I thought the very point of liveCD is that
it autodetects stuff. Your kernel already autodetects
everything except X.

What is it that you want?

I found linuxfromscratch not worth a penny though it
was attractive at first. Too much theory, no practical
focus.

if youdont need x , then you probably need just the kernel which you can 
make bootable probably using rawwrite or something similar and can have the 
the other specific nees compiled with thekernel , i remember looking 
something in the net long time ago which gives you hardware detection and 
network support which can fit in a floppy

Hi,

I read this on RMS's page:

I was built at a laboratory in Manhattan around 1953, and moved to the
MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1971. My hobbies include affection,
international folk dance, flying, cooking, physics, recorder, puns,
science fiction fandom, and programming; I magically get paid for doing
the last one. About a year ago i split up with the PDP-10 computer to
which i was married for ten years. We still love each other, but the
world is taking us in different directions. For the moment I still live
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, among our old memories. "Richard Stallman"
is just my mundane name; you can call me "rms". 

He says "I magically get paid for the last one". Is that a sarcastic
remark?

Mohammed Riyaz

  There must be outfits which will burn data onto DVD-R if you supply
it to them on multiple CDs, but why risk data corruption due to flaky
hardware, buggy and virus-prone OSes, etc.?

  Just get a fairly recent ATAPI DVD+/-RW writer, and any recent version
of mkisofs/cdrecord with a recent kernel should be able to burn a .iso
to DVD-R. I got a Samsung dual-layer writer for <Rs.2k and the media
costs about Rs.25 or so. Definitely a worthwhile upgrade from CD-R/RW
- the speed of writing alone is worth the premium over CD-R.

  It will also play DVDs and write CD-R/RWs, so you lose nothing from
switching to DVD+/-RW.

Sivachander already gave you an excellent reply.

In general it is always good to be self sufficient.
Never ask others to do what you can do yourself. 

This has been the guiding principle of my life and I
have found it very useful. 

Btw, I had a couple of silly questions. 

1) What is the cost of rewritable DVDs? 

2) What is the capacity? Is it 4.7 GB or are there
variants?

3) Do you get the latest Tamil movies on DVDs?

4) If so what is the encryption used? Can I crack them
to make them viewable on other countries? 

regards,
Girish

Don't you feel that way too ?
Computers and programming is a hobby for geeks so it's funny when
someone makes a huge deal about "Software Engineers" and the money
they are paid.

It's a like a stamp-collector being paid for collecting stamps. It's
not work for him, he is going to do it whether you pay him or not. :)

  Not exactly sure, but it isn't cost-competitive with DVD-R. There are
also readability issues - not all DVD-RW media can be read reliably
in older DVD-ROM drives.

   I believe it's only 4.7 GB at the moment - dual-layer DVD-RW
either hasn't shown up yet or is too expensive.

3) Do you get the latest Tamil movies on DVDs?


   I haven't looked, but I imagine that they're probably issued after
a 6-9 month delay. However, the Malaysian pirates probably make
counterfeits immediately after the theatre release.


4) If so what is the encryption used? Can I crack them

   If it is to remain playable on a retail DVD player, it has to use
standard CSS encryption - and this easily handled by libdvdcss
(which is usually used by Xine, Ogle, Mplayer, etc.)

   However, region-coding is an entirely different issue altogether -
this is drive- and player-specific. Not all drives implement it in
the embedded SW for the drive controller - if it's implemented
in the host-side device-driver, then it's not an issue and all the
Linux DVD players simply ignore the region coding information.
If it's implemented inside the drive, then you'll have to look for
updated flashable firmware that removes region coding - which
may or may not exist for the drive in question.

  Most retail DVD players from China no longer implement region
coding - i.e. they are region-free, so any DVD will play on them.
I recommend a unit called 'Scorpio', which has TOSlink optical
out, Dolby Digital 5.1 decoder with 6-channel preamp outputs,
2-channel stereo power amp built-in (useful if you just want a
tiny player that can be connected to a pair of bookshelf speakers-
I use a pair of tiny JVCs, but anything will work, including
homebuilt stuff), a DB-15 VGA output (great for connecting
to monitors/panels/projectors!!), progressive scan, and the capability
to play most MPEG4 files (YMMV, but it depends on the codec(s)
that are used).

   I opened it up, and the electronics are great except for lousy
electrolytic capacitors on the SMPS/audio board. About an
hour of minor surgery ensued, and it now sports a combination
of professional-grade Nippon Chemicon LXZ, Matsushita FC/FK
and Nichicon P* capacitors - which should be good for about
25 years of service. The durability and AV quality are now
comparable to $2000+ DVD players. It's possible to make it
comparable to $25000 professional DVD players with further
surgery, but the point of dimishing returns has already been
reached. Not too bad for a Rs.2500 player with about Rs.50
worth of capacitor upgrades.

-Siva

P.S. If you plan to go this route and do the capacitor upgrades,
stick with non-aqueous, low-ESR, 105c capacitors from one
of the Japanese majors: Matsushita/Panasonic, Nichicon,
Nippon Chemicon, Elna, Rubycon or Sanyo. Everything else
is crap and will fail in a year or two. Avoid Keltron or any of the
local/Korean/Chinese/Taiwanese brands like the plague - ironically,
some of these are priced higher than their technologically superior
Japanese counterparts.

Many thanks Toufeeq. I am hoping I get a good deal if
I buy DVDs in bulk. I think it is time to throw away
CDs and floppies and cut over to USB keydrives and
DVDs...

FYI I got to know you get a 1 GB USB flash for just
1200 or so. 

I expect the price to fall further.

Girish

There are several types of rewritable DVDs, and not all drives are
compatible with all. DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM seem to be the most
common ones.

Cost of Scorpio? Where do you get it? Is that a DVD
player? Software ? What is it? Please  pardon my
ignorance and be gentle. :-)

What is progressive and deinterlaced scanning?

Is MPEG4 better off than flash format? I doubt it. Is
it possible to build flash codec into the thing?

What is DB-15 output? I hear that LCD displays are
digital unlike CRT which uses analog technology. Is
there a straight digital interface that avoids the ADC
DAC convesion and consequent signal degradation and
power consumption?

Is there a move to replace the aging VGA interface?

Coming to audio, is it possible to get a cheap Dolby
or DTS experience at home? I hear there is some
politics and lack of standardisation there. Do you
know anythinga about it?

How to plan the acoustics? What should be the
placement angle of the speakers? What should be the
distance between them? 

Can preamp stage be avoided? Does it introduce any
noise? 

Is it  possible to do some white noise filtering in
software using a free tool like audacity or something?


I have already had success with low pass filtering
with audacity. It works very well.

Can I have high fidelity audio reproduction with a
frequency response that is nearly 20-20k Hz? I am sure
it is not reqd but somewhat close would do.

Can we do AAC, AC3 and other stuff completely in
software itself? 

What will be the cost of such a home theatre setup?

Thanks in advance Siva for bearing with me. Please
pardon if I have asked any stupid questions. :-)

How do I do this hardware hacking? What minor surgery
did you do? Why is the role of capacitors so pivotal?

In this digital world when PLLs can tune FM radio
without any RC circuit why are capacitors still
hurting us?

What do you mean by point of diminishing returns? I
don't get you. I think the bottom line is how much it
would cost.

And how to minimise the costs? There is certainly a
void in the market when it comes to a decent home
theatre product. 

The Sony large screen television and expensive music
systems are all passe.

I think with a little ingenuity it will be possible
for us to make a world class homebrew home theatre.

How to go about it? Any advice?

My dear Siva,

What a genius! It is nothing short of it. 

I really don't want to waste it away. Why don't you
put this up in some website or something? 

I did read about the aging of capacitors in some
electronics book. 

Looking forward to hearing from you soon. :-)

Girish

Binand,

Do you mean to say I should not go for DVD RW media
until the dust settles?

In which case this begs the question what is the cost
of DVD R media?

TIA.

There are DVD-R and DVD+R type single-recording DVDs, with or without
DL (dual layering), as well.

I think PC DVD writers can read/write most, if not all types, but not
all types can be duplicated to an incompatible type. It is one of the
murkier aspects of having multiple groups creating standards (DVD
Forum v/s DVD Alliance).

I haven't explored this much yet, so it could even be a non-issue.

Remastering Knoppix should be much easier. Being Debian, its very easy
to add remove packages from it. I can point you to right documentation

I have no idea how many people are using this modem. I
am sorry I really don't have any time for writing a
wiki right now. It is plain text without any
formatting. If any of you can insert the appropriate
SGML tags and wikify it , it will be great. 

I did try speaking to Airtel to sell this solution to
them. But they wouldn't listen. :-(

If you any of you know any top guns in Airtel maybe I
could make a second attempt. 

This solution hardly took me five days but it can save
Airtel a great deal of money and rigmarole if this
modem is popular and also if linux is popular. :-)

Since the current approach seems to be that they ask
you to give you a request in writing, the service
engineer comes home and fits an ethernet modem. This
approach has several problems.

1) You have to wait until the representative comes
2) It is definitely loss of cash for Airtel since they
have to deploy a more expensive ethernet modem
3) The service engineer's visit does entail
inconvenience for Airtel and yourself
4) Many machines don't have ethernet card and you are
forced to purchase one :-(

But I am a hacker and I have no idea how biz works in
the real world. 

I am attaching the article in plain text. A word of
caution for Windoze folks. Due to CR CRLF problem, you
should open it in Wordpad or vim , not Notepad...

Admittedly it is quite difficult to follow and
somewhat quirky to get it working. I am planning to
make a liveCD image soon, it should be ready in about
a week's time. 

If any of you could host the ISO ,it will be great
too!

I have made every attempt to make the procedure simple
for users, but you need a lot of experience to follow
it. Sorry about that. 

Best,
Girish

-------------- next part --------------
So do you want to be able to connect to the BSNL broadband network using an Airtel's Beetel 100CX USB modem? 

Simple. Just follow this procedure.

First download the latest shiny kernel from 
 ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.17.8.tar.bz2

 You can use any method of course though most of you would use the browser. I being a command line jukie prefer wget. 

 If my link is somewhat unstable I would type this.

 $ wget -c  ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.17.8.tar.bz2

 So I really don't have to bother about broken downloads since wget automatically resumes the download instead of starting from the beginning.

 Once you have the shiny kernel downloaded, unpack it. 

 # mv linux-2.6.17.8.tar.bz   /usr/src 

 # tar jxf linux-2.6.17.8.tar.bz    

 Now you have to obtain the drivers for the Conexant accessrunner chipset called cxacru from 

 http://accessrunner.sourceforge.net/driver.shtml

 And following the instructions there, you have to have the cvs program installed. You could also use TortoiseCVS plugin or a graphical cvs client.

 Type this.

 $cvs -z9 -q -d :pserver:anoncvs:anoncvs@cvs.infradead.org:/home/cvs co usbatm

 and put the files under drivers/usb/atm in the kernel source tree. Precisely this is put under say,

 /usr/src/linux-2.6.17.8/drivers/usb/atm

 Now we are all set to build our kernel driver which is a very critical component of the whole affair. 

 Please ensure that you have built a 2.6 kernel before. I don't want you to figure out unrelated problems and get discouraged. If you are an experienced kernel hacker you may go ahead of course. Whatever it is, you can always email me should you have any problems.

# cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.17.8
# make xconfig (or make menuconfig)

 Go to the networking subsystems and choose all the relevant components to be included in the kernel.

 Please remember to select the top menu item 

    "Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	...
	Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) (EXPERIMENTAL) (ATM)
	...
	Support for Host-side USB (USB)
	...
	USB DSL modem support (USB_ATM)
	...
	Conexant AccessRunner USB support (USB_CXACRU)


Of course you need to select several other modules to be included too especially the USB subsystem drivers. There are several of them. Doesn't hurt to include all of them as modules since you are going to be loading them only when required. 


Then if you are on a Debian GNU/Linux system you are in luck bcoz life is goign to be very simple now onwards since I am going to deal only with that now onwards. Also several distros these days are spinoffs from the Debian project, so my instructions might apply to them as well. 

I will however try if I can help give generic instructions that can be followed on other linux distros too. 

First the easy Debian way.

#apt-get install kernel-package ( If you don't already have it)

#cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.17.8
#make-kpkg clean && make-kpkg --initrd kernel_image

This will ask you a question to which you answer yes and then the kernel will be built over a long time depending upon the speed of your machine. 

In the end, you type, 

# cd ..

#dpkg -i kernel-image--2.6.17.8_0.00.Custom_i386.deb

This will also create entries for this kernel in your boot loader say grub.

Now it is time to reboot into your new kernel and continue our story. But before we get there I will try to explain how this can be done on other linux systems.

type

# cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.17.8

# make clean

# make dep

# make 

# make modules

# make modules_install

# cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17.8

# mkinitrd -o /boot/initrd.img-2.6.17.8

Make sure you set initrd to use cramfs and that you have enabled cramfs support in the kernel.

Now, copy your .config and System.map by

# cp /usr/src/linux-2.6.17.8/.config /boot/config-2.6.17.8
# cp /usr/src/linux-2.6.17.8/System.map /boot/System.map-2.6.17.8

Now it is time to add the entries for our kernel in /boot/grub/menu.lst

Add the following lines 


 title           Debian GNU/Linux, kernel 2.6.17.3 
 root            (hd0,1) # This line may differ if ur root partition is not /dev/hda2
 kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.17.3 root=/dev/hda2 ro 
 initrd          /boot/initrd.img-2.6.17.3
 savedefault
 boot


 Now, it is time to reboot into your flashy new kernel image!

 It is beyond the scope of this article to troubleshoot kernel boot problems. These days it is no longer a black art it once was. So just go ahead and have fun. Should have any trouble please don't hesitate to mail me.

 Now let us assume that you have a kernel with the module cxacru built in.
 Now we want to be able to load it every time the kernel boots. So for that we add the line
 cxacru 
to the  file /etc/modules. Now try rebooting and see if

#lsmod 

lists the module cxacru as being loaded.

Please remember that for the cxacru module to load properly and work properly it requires the kernel's usbatm framework to be compiled. This is present in all kernels above 2.6.10. The usbatm framework exports a generic USB ATM device to the userspace that can be used in various ways. 

If you have an academic interest to learn more about ATM support in the linux kernel take a look at http://linux-atm.sourceforge.net

Ok time to get back to business.

Now it is time to get to something interesting.  I mean even more interesting.

We have to now configure the linux "hotplug" interface to load the firmware into the modem. Normally the hotplug framework is inclded as part of most linux distros.

Time to configure the hotplug framework to load the firmware into the USB modem once it is plugged into the USB socket. 

Note that the USB architecture is fairly complex with multiple layers.
Fortunately we do not have to get into all that level of detail to get out modem working. 

All we have to do is create two files conexant.usermap and conexant under the directory /etc/hotplug/usb.

The content of the conexant.usermap file is just one line but very cryptic.

Here goes, all in one line.

conexant 0x0003 0x0572 0xcb00 0x0000 0x0000 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x000    00000

And in the file conexant , enter this.


#!/bin/sh

# Load bulk/interrupt transfer test firmware into
# various EZ-USB USB devices that will run it
#
# Assumes 2002_04_11 release of fxload (or later)

FIRMWARE=/usr/local/lib/firmware/cxacru-fw.bin

FLAGS="-t fx2"

LOADER=/sbin/fxload

# use "-s $A3LOAD" for firmware that goes into external RAM
A3LOAD=/usr/share/usb/a3load.hex
# missing firmware?
if [ ! -r $FIRMWARE ]; then
    if [ -x /usr/bin/logger ]; then
	/usr/bin/logger -t $0 "missing $FIRMWARE for $PRODUCT ??"
    fi
    exit 1
fi

# missing loader?
if [ ! -x $LOADER ]; then
    if [ -x /usr/bin/logger ]; then
	/usr/bin/logger -t $0 "missing $LOADER ??"
    fi
    exit 1
fi

if [ -x /usr/bin/logger ]; then
    /usr/bin/logger -t $0 "load $FIRMWARE for $PRODUCT to $DEVICE"
fi
$LOADER $FLAGS -I $FIRMWARE


Of course you should make this file executable with the command

#chmod +x conexant

Now it is time to do things that we missed. I am a little contrariwise, so kindly bear with me.

We need a program called fxload to load the firmware. On my Debian box,I just have to type,

# apt-get install fxload

Ok, now the next step is to actually extract the firmware corresponding to the modem from the Modem's Windoze driver CD. Insert the CDROM into your computer and type 
$ mount /cdrom
 or
# mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /cdrom

 And then copy the file CnxEtU.sys from the CD to your hard disk and put it somewhere, say /tmp.

 So now, we still don't have the firmware yet. We have it in some other form. We have to convert it into the form that fxload understands.

 So we need another program called cxacru-fw which needs to be downloaded like we did before.

 $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@accessrunner.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/accessrunner login 

 Type enter when prompted for password.


 $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@accessrunner.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/accessrunner co -P utils. After download you should have a directory with this contents.


 -rw-r--r--  1 girish girish    453 2005-02-07 02:15 README
 -rw-r--r--  1 girish girish  15145 2005-02-07 02:15 COPYING

 drwxr-xr-x  2 girish girish   4096 2006-08-04 09:07 CVS

 Now just type make. 

 You will have an executable called cxacru-fw created there. 

 Now we are all set to extract the firmware from the CnxEtU.sys file we copied to /tmp.

 So now go to the utils directory where you have the cxacru-fw program and type

 $./cxacru /tmp/CnxEtU.sys cxacru-fw.bin

 If God is happy with your deeds so far you will have the firmware safely stored in the file cxacru-fw.bin.

 Now it is time to copy this file to the location mentioned in the conexant file long ago. If you have been following my instructions to the dot , you will do fine by copying it to /usr/local/lib/firmware directory.

 At last I am done with the configuration required to get the modem working. That is, if all goes well now we have the modem communicating perfectly with the computer.
 
 To verify this , just reboot the computer. Or type this .

#/etc/init.d/hotplug start

 This should load the firmware into the modem and your modem LED should start blinking. Congrats! You are halfway thro'.

 Now, connect the telephone line to the other end and you should see the LED blink for a few seconds and glow constantly.

 This means that the ATM link has been established with the modem server.

 To check the status, you can use the /proc interface of your kernel. I am hoping you enabled that during your kernel build process. If not no harm as it is used only for diagnostic purposes.

 Do a cat /proc/net/atm/devices

 You should see a line corresponding to cxacru.

 Also cat /proc/net/atm/cxacru will give you more info too.

 If you need to know what is the bandwidth configured for the link, you can take a look at /var/log/messages by

# tail -f /var/log/messages

 Fine. So now you got your ATM connection established. Now it is time to connect to BSNL; oh sorry Airtel using this modem.

 But the title of the article is connecting to BSNL right? 

 So let us do that first. Later we will connect to Airtel also.

 For that now, we have to get the program br2648ctl . 

# apt-get install br2648ctl

 Once installed just run the command 

# br2648ctl -b -c 0 -a 0.35 

 for BSNL 

 and 

# br2648ctl -b -c 0 -a 1.32

 for Airtel. 

 Other than this and the userid/passwords,there is really no difference in connecting to BSNL or Airtel. 

If this command was successful it will create a virtual nas0 interface. You have to link it up with the command

# ifconfig nas0 up

Now, ifconfig should list nas0 as one of the network interfaces. 

Now, it is time to dial using PPPoE. But wait a minute. We have to configure pppoe first. This is something many of you will be familiar. But I will give you my config file just in case.

The file /etc/ppp/peers/conexant file contains this.

lcp-no-failure 3
noipdefault
defaultroute
user <your user id here>
noauth
noaccomp
nopcomp
noccp
novj
holdoff 4
persist
maxfail 25
updetach
usepeerdns
plugin /usr/lib/pppd/2.4.3/rp-pppoe.so
nas0

And create a /etc/ppp/pap-secrets and /etc/ppp/chap-secrets file with your
username and password in one line. For instance just create a line

girish * ash

for configuring user "girish" with password "ash". 

Make this file non readable for others with the command

# chmod 0400 /etc/ppp/chap-secrets /etc/ppp/pap-secrets

Now, BSNL uses CHAP and Airtel uses PAP auth. But you can easily figure these things out by calling them up if necessary.

Now, let us connect. Moment of truth is fast approaching!

# pppd call conexant

should connect you to the Internet! Wow! It is amazing, isn't it? To be able to connect to the Internet using an Airtel modem to BSNL network? 

Now, let us do some trick to ensure that we connect to the Internet everytime we boot seamlessly. 

Just edit the file /etc/network/interfaces under Debian and add these lines to the end.

auto pppoe
iface pppoe inet ppp
	pre-up br2648tl -b -c 0 -a 0.35 # for BSNL
	pre-up ifconfig up nas0
	provider conexant
	post-down kill $(cat /var/run/nas0.pid)


Now, since broadband connectivity doesnt count the hours or minutes that you stay connected and since there is no such thing as a virus or automatic downloader for linux, you can safely connect everytime you boot up and enjoy life. 

Now, one last tip. Since you will most likely do all these things on a different machine and if you want to set this up on a different PC too this is what you have to do. 

Just copy the kernel and the config files. The config files , you know of course. I will tell you how to copy your kernel to another machine. 

Just insert a USB flash drive and mount it. 

# mount /dev/sda1 /usb

# cd /usb
# cp /boot/*.2.6.17.8 . ( We are copying the kernel image, initrd , System.map and config files )

# tar zcf modules.tar.gz /lib/modules/2.6.17.8 

And we are set. 

Copy these files to ur friend's machine's /boot directory and /lib/modules directory. 

And of course don't forget to add the appropriate entries in /boot/grub/menu.lst file as I mentioned above. 

Boot into the new kernel and Enjoy!

For the electronically challenged, another option is to purchase
a Philips DVP series player.  Region unlocking, DivX playback,
still pictures, mp3, etc are all available either through magic settings
or firmware upgrades.  Newer models support HDMI.  My 4 year
old DVP is still chugging happily.

However, the connectors are rather lacking -- 2 channel pre-amp
coax, optical audio out, composite video, svideo.  The Scorpio
OTOH aces everything with a VGA connector :-)

Nice howto.  Only one point though

I believe hotplug's deprecated for newer kernel versions - udev takes
over the functions of hotplug.  2.6.14 and newer, I think

At least my ubuntu install (latest dapper) has 2.6.15.7 and udev but no
hotplug

I am no kernel hacker as yet. :-) I know, I know udev
is userspace but I believe it doest the job of the
kernel. 

In any case I am a lil dense about what you are
saying. I have a feeling you are mistaken. 

Since AFAIK udev is a new gen devfs framework whereas
hotplug and coldplug are for configuring uPnP devices
like PCI and USB devices for plug and play. It detects
the device connected and takes actions automagically
like uploading the firmware on to the device and such.


I think this has nothing to do with udev which creates
device nodes on the disk depending upon the devices it
finds by autoprobing. 

Please don't take my words as gospel. I am still
learning the multifarious aspects of the great linux
kernel! :-)

regards,
Girish

Hmm, I think you are talking about some bleeding edge
stuff about which nobody knows. I did ask google the
question, "udev hotplug" and the great grandfather
google gave me only one mail that said udev can do the
job of hotplug.

I don't have time to do more digging. It works and
that is what matters. And it works well, so there is
no need to worry. 

As they say,"If it ain't broken don't fix it!"

Girish

Interesting to note that at this very moment I am
having trouble installing gentoo as the kernel
wouldn't go past the "Activating udev" line. It is a
very old crappy hardware, so maybe it is not just a
udev issue.

Anyway I am quite sure udev is somewhat buggy being
new.

And yday I did run into the bash bug we were
discussing. I was downloading this iso, power went
duri ng the nite and next morning I was wracking my
brains to figure out the URL to give to wget...

Such is the nature of things. :-)

Girish

To use plug and play with 2.4 Linux kernels, they
brought out the hotplug scripts. 2.4 Linux kernels use
devfs. So, when you plug in any device, say a USB pen
drive, for example, you will need to look in dmesg
output to see what device file it was, /dev/sda1 or
whatever and mount it manually or use hotplug.

In 2.6 Linux kernels, udev is used. In user-space,
there is a udevd daemon that gets notification from
the udev in kernel-space when devices are
attached/removed.

  ps -e | grep udev

So, all plug and play devices are automatically
mounted.

udev is not new. It has been there from 2.6 Linux
kernels. Please read Grek Kroah-Hartman's paper
presented in OLS 2003:

http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev.html

http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ

I use it on Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu and don't have any
problems with it.

SK

If you use KDE or GNOME, then it is simple. GNOME, I don't recall now,
but for KDE, Go to the Control Center, choose "Regional..." and there,
choose "Keyboard Layouts". On the left, you'll find lots of different
keyboard layouts on ce you enable keyboard layouts. Find the Malayalam
and Tamil ones, and add them. Once you are done, you will notice that
at the bottom right of your screen, there is an icon with the US flag
(assuming your keyboard is a us layout). Clicking on it cycles through
Malayalam, Tamil and back to English keyboards. I am sure there is a
similar way in GNOME. Since you are using Debian etch, do

apt-get install ttf-malayalam-fonts ttf-tamil-fonts

if you have not done so already.

HTH.

In GNOME it is here:

Applications -> Desktop Preferences -> Keyboard

In the above you ll find _Layout options_ in which you can select the
keyborad layout you want and add it.

Are you sure you want the Malayalam keyboard layout? That is for
people familiar with touch-typing in Malayalam. What you probably need
is a transliterating editor - and when I initially investigated this
feature, the best solution I came up with was

Message-ID: <a8f990120608190334x2851e663n910d09cfd031c30d@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,
          Today's talk at IISc was one of the best I've heard from
RMS. He spoke for about 2.5 hours non-stop, and the talk was broad-
ranging, forceful and uncompromising. He spoke about GNU, FSF, DMCA,
DRM, SW patents, Free Trade/WTO, Copyright/Piracy etc. I didn't
necessarily agree with everything that was said, but it was very
clearly enunciated.

   I Also picked up the GNU lapel pin that RMS was selling after the
talk as fund-raising activities for FSF - it's a very nicely made trinket
for Rs.200, gold-plated with black lacquer inlay, with the GNU head in
gold. He sold about a dozen pins, not too bad for about the 10 minutes
they were on display. Also some GNU stickers as freebies.

    I also caused a minor embarrassment - I volunteered to ferry RMS,
Prof. Gopinath (CSA, IISc), and a few others to a lunch appointment, and
the car refused to start just after RMS got into it. RMS and the others
took an auto and went for lunch, while I dropped out and tried to fix the
car. Missed opportunity!

    Anyways, he's going to be around until the GPLv3 conference, so
more updates later (if there's anything to report). Right now, I gotta
go see a man about a car.

  The Scorpio is actually
a DVD player component (a HW box with a DVD drive
and decoder electronics) that you (usually) connect to a TV.

Is MPEG4 better off than flash format?


 MPEG4 is more open than (Macromedia) Flash, and that's good
enough for me. It's easier to implement in a FLOSS stack.

Is it possible to build flash codec into the thing?


 IMHO,  no - it's not  there, and it's not worth it.

What is DB-15 output?


  The VGA connector on a PC.

Can we do AAC, AC3 and other stuff completely in
> software itself?


   Yes, actually Dolby AC3 decoders are usually embedded
systems running some specialized DSP code to implement
the audio codecs, and a bunch of D/A converters, that's all.

     Basically it means that the player
is already good enough, and any further investment of time
and money will only make it slightly better.

Hi,
Changing the keyboard layout and language settings will only enable a 
malayalam in keyboard to you. If you need to get malayalam when you type 
in english, i.e. phonetic keyboard then you have to install 'scim'

Use apt-get to download and install 'scim'. In additional u need 
additional packages to support scim. Important ones are: scim-uim, 
scim-m17n, scim-gtk2-immodule, scim-modules-socket, scim-modules-table 
and scim-tables-additional. The first 3 are very important.

Once you have these things installed, you should be able to get 'SCIM 
input method setup' in your preferences menu.

You have a couple of things more to do, before you can comfortably start 
typing in malayalam. I have written a procedure for making scim work for 
tamil. The same holds true for malayalam also. scim-tables-additional 
provides language tables for all indian languages. Here is my blog for 
you to refer,

Any idea how to do it for Windowmaker? I am sure SCIM
layer should be visible from any window manager, not
only KDE or GNOME...

How do I ensure that ppl who open my document can read
it? I don't want ppl to install any font. 

Do I have to go the unicode way?

In the worst case of course I can send a pdf or jpg of
course in which there is both Tamil and English text.

regards,
Girish

I don't think what you want is possible in the most general case.
Unicode specifies only an encoding which encompasses most (all?) known
scripts in the world. How these characters are rendered will still
depend upon the font used (and if the source document's specified font
is not available on the destination computer, weird stuff will be
rendered).

PDF format addresses this by having a font-embedding system, which
allows fonts to be shipped along with the document, at a size penalty.

An excellent how-to!

This is more convenient for the user.

I have a very simple question. Consider that I am a hardcore linux user who refuses to use Windows at all. Now, how can I get the latest kernel and the driver for the usb modem without booting into Windows? I would stick to ethernet modem rather. It will be worth waiting.

> 3) The service engineer's visit does entail

It is easy for them to install an ethernet modem compared to answering a linux newbies random questions.

I agree to this. In this case it is worth spending some time.

Linux Desktop are out of the box. since mp3, dvd are proprietory
format and are not open sourced. when mp3 format is open sourced, then
linux for sure will be working out of the box.

That is a debatable issue. There are a few people who believe that
Eric Raymond is probably going a bit too far in his dilution of
philosophy to gain acceptability.

Does popularity have to be achieved only by diluting principles?
Maybe, but I don't like it.

Just my view...

My dear brothers and sisters,

Please do not take what people write at face value. If
the guy says that he cannot play mp3 files, he does
not mean that he needs an mp3 codec. He just means
that he is not able to play any audio with linux. 

At least this is what I am guessing. What has Eric S
Raymond got to do with it? :-)

Many of us are spectacularly gifted when it comes to
communicating something wrongly. :-) I mean we want to
say something, ppl understand the exact opposite. Even
otherwise techspeak is Greek and Latin. On top of that
we have a communication gap...

Anyway I suppose he has to get his sound card working
somehow either by loading the appropriate module or
something else. I simply don't have details. 

And he has to use a simple player like mpg321 to test
it. 

Btw, mp3 decoding is open and has always been free. I
myself have worked on the libao and libmad source
code. 

It is only mp3 encoding that is proprietary. mp2
encoding is free I think...

Happy Weekend guys!

regards,
Girish

Noorul,

Please read the complete mail, spend a minute or two
digesting the contents and what the person is trying
to  say. When did I say that the howto is the solution
that  Airtel is going to use? 

In fact this is not a howto even. 

Anyway the surest way I can ensure that Airtel does
not buy this from me is to show them this procedure.
Already there is lot of prejudice against linux. If I
show them this complicated mumbo jumbo, they will
throw me out of the office. 

That is why I am making a livecd that works out of the
box to demonstrate it. Even that will not do. People
may not even want to install livecd to disk. They will
want their own linux distro. 

And each linux distro patches the kernel in their own
way. I cannot patch the kernel simply. For me to make
an install CD that has a point and click interface
like Windoze is a colossal task given the fact the the
linux market is so fragmented with no
standardisation...

So can't you see you were not comparing apples to
apples? I was saying that a Windoze like install CD
for linux can avoid the user the 4 points I discussed
above. 

That is, when software can simply solve the problem
without user intervention, why should Airtel go thro'
the rigmarole of replacing the modem? 

This howto is for hackers who want to learn and have
fun! And for those who enjoy doing things
themselves...

Girish

Message-ID: <20060820061005.18950.qmail@web35602.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dearest friends,

I have not yet started preparing slides for the
presentation I promised. Apropos of that I want some
inputs from you guys as to what topics will interest
you. 

Please remember that my idea is to help you students
and professionals either to get better jobs or to be
better programmers. So think from that angle and tell
me exactly what you want. No offlist replies will be
entertained!

Please get back to me at the earliest as I am running
out of time! 

Details about the logistics are awaited. As of now the
plan is to have a full two day course on networking
and security. Day 1 will be networking. Day 2 will be
security and spam. 

I am planning to screw up a weekend of yours! Hope
your girlfriend will understand! Ha ha! :-)

Here are the topics I have come up with for Day 1. I
am thinking of six hours of talking. This should be
sufficient to cover the following topics.

a)MAC and physical layer(802.3, 802.11, bridging,
repeaters and othe PHY concepts) 

b)TCP/IP stack, header fields, TCP and IP internals

c)IP routing protocols, OSPF, BGP, RIP

d)App protocols like SMTP,IMAP,POP3,HTTP,FTP,rsync,
ssh 

e)ppp,pppoe, pppoa, integration between telephone and
data networks

f)New age protocols, CARP, VRRP, MPLS, QoS concepts
like Intserv, Diffserv

g)VoIP concepts, mbone, Video on demand networks

h)peer to peer protocols, NAT , chat and presence
protocols like XMPP

i)VPNs and tunneling

I think you should start reading up Tanenbaum if you
have not already. Browse Cisco documents for
networking topics. I think IPJ has few good pointers. 

Please please come prepared or else I will be wasting
your time. 

I don't want to commit the date. Logistics will be
worked out later. I think you have a time of at least
three to four weeks. But start now and go to the
bookstore and start reading...

love,
Girish

Dear Sir,

Wikipedia content easily runs into several terabytes
even if you want only the English version. And a DVD
can store only 4.7 GB. You can however choose a few
categories or leave out certain categories. Things
like American history and obscure religious stuff
might not interest many students. 

If you want science, physics, math, computer science,
biology and current affairs, then you need to see how
big this will become. 

I think for math, wolfram.com is much better than
wikipedia. I am no math geek but I think lot of
efforts have gone into it. It is also totally free.

As to the tech part, I think you can go in for on the
fly compression like liveCD and use something like
squashfs that compresses files in the best way. 

Since your objective is a noble one I will gladly help
you out. Please contact me offlist and I will give you
exactly what you want. You may have to get me a DVD
burner though. I don't have one! :-)

regards,
Girish

Dear Thiagu,

What you want is already present and you can try the following URL:  The
entire Wikipedia is 6GB

www.webaroo.com

All the packs including some of the other things which are going to be
useful also can be downloaded using the following URL

http://www.webaroo.com/rooWebPacks.html

Hope this will help you.

Actually, if it had been proprietary SW, I could have tried the usual M$
fix:
Close all windows, and give it a 3-finger salute.

Or maybe the reason why it refused to move was that there were no
Drivers for it in GNU/Linux.

Sorry - lame jokes. Ding-dong.

That is quite some jump. Sure you don't want to insert another topic
in between those which would take a look at basic IP routing via
longest-prefix match, routable and non-routable protocols, network
topologies, policy routing etc.?

Message-ID: <a54a308e0608200302w5356e1a7oa7d270a360e0c00b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Before reading my mail, I would like you all to read Open Source guru
advocates ideological
shift<http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/17/eric_raymond_linux_compromise/>

Thats running in my mind for more than 6 months. How far GNU/Linux is gonna
compromise on the Desktop Market ?

The people who are going to use GNU/Linux as their Desktop arent geeks(like
us). They do not even know what a "command line tool" and no way you can
make him/her to learn, as he/she would tell, why would he/she has to learn
!.

We do know that there are patent rights with Mp3,DVD etc., There are no
support for many plugin formats for the same reason too. If one needs such
things to be done, he/she is redirected to pages like ,

   - For Ubuntu <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats>
   - For Novell/SuSE<http://www.desktoplinux.com/articles/AT7527984757.html>
   - For RedHat<http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/ForbiddenItems#head-480f1c231662c4279ebc75f7298db407ee0a5593>

Dont these have to work out of the box if you really want it to be used by
the normal people ?

Yes, companies need to compromise and thats what M$ had done during the
start (Gud or Bad,one has to admit).

I would say this is one of the reasons, people fear of adopting GNU/Linux
into Desktops.

When companies like Novell,RedHat have decided their target are Desktop
Users, why would they not get exclusive rights like how M$ has ?. Sure,
there should be a way. If M$ is able to do things, why not WE.

Take a GNU/Linux Desktop Oriented Distro, list out things what would be
required to make it still better(in terms of out of the box support), let us
prepare the list, take survey, and submit online the results.This will help
the companies understand that there are quite large number of people needing
these requirements.(I am sure they would know already)

There are many other things also that we need to compromise. There are many
proprietary products in Linux itself (like, CrossOverOffice) which are great
deal for Desktop Users. If we neglect them,and just strive for only FREE(as,
Free of Cost), I think the situation would be the same and sure normal
people would not be able to use GNU/Linux.

Am not at all telling that GNU/Linux is not growing or there are only
pitfalls. These issues are something we need to keep track of.And my kind
advice would be to spread the word FREE as in FREE TO USE/REDISTRIBUTE and
not as in FREE OF COST. That leads into a different scenario.

We are doing a good job in spreading about GNU/Linux by conducting LDDs at
various institutions. Is there any way to conduct LDD for the normal public
?. If so, then , it would be great show and sure our voices will reach the
Public, Media.

One of the main reason for me to be with Freespire <http://freespire.org> ,
is their Vision on how to make GNU/Linux best in the Desktop Usage. They
have legal rights in giving out the restricted
formats<http://wiki.freespire.org/index.php/Summary_of_Proprietary_Components>out
of the
box.Please dont think am here to spread about Freespire. These things are
the basic needs for a Desktop User.

The future of GNU/Linux is good if we make GNU/Linux the best in Desktop
Usage as stated by Eric Raymond.

Subject: [Ilugc] Undelete: impossible on ext3!
Message-ID: <44E8353E.7090007@gmx.net>

Hi,

I am running Ubuntu dapper and I have ext3 file system for my root 
partition. I accidentally deleted a whole bunch of my files, almost 2 
GB. I was looking for ways to restore the files when this one shocked me 
a bit..

http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/1/7/135

<quote>
..in order to ensure that ext3 can safely resume an unlink after a
crash, it actually zeros out the block pointers in the inode, whereas
ext2 just marks these blocks as unused in the block bitmaps and marks
the inode as "deleted" and leaves the block pointers alone.
Your only hope is to "grep" for parts of your files that have been 
deleted and hope for the best...
</quote>

Even assuming grep can help this way, I don't have any idea about the 
'parts' as most of the files are non-text.

Just when I almost felt like crying..I remembered (so much for my 
memory) those files were actually in a mounted fat32 partition and I did 
have a backup of about 50% of those on CDs. To cut the story short, I 
got back all my files using an undelete app in windows.

Call me lazy for not making frequent backups but most of us are really 
that lazy anyway. I just escaped this time but do people like me have a 
solution next time when a file gets irrevocably deleted from an ext3 
partition? Should I always keep my important files on a non-ext3 
partition (prolly fat32 for the number of undelete tools supporting it)?
How would you go about it?

Kumaraguru

IIRC I read some article on the net saying that Microsoft was planning
on shipping ``undelete'' as an option in their FSs (as part of Vista),
but then rolled it back due to security implications...

It was privacy concerns primarily with some security thrown in. And it
was generally, FUD - since the Recycle Bin provides approximately
similar functionality (and there are several recycle bin
implementations for Linux too).

The System Restore feature is another "time-travel" feature in
Windows. I believe Redhat has a similar feature for its high-end RHN
subscribers (part of its provisioning module).

You are painting a incomplete picture. Some users and distributions care 
more about not just the right to use and redistribute but also the right 
to modify and make changes. There several free of cost proprietary 
players and plugins and some of them allow free redistributions but 
patent licenses would make them incompatible with Free software licenses 
which allow modification.

If distributions are willing to license and include such proprietary 
software they could do so and they already do.

correct me if i am wrong, as for as i know, GNU tools are created as
an alternative to UNIX command line tools. Its not targetted to a end
user. its target is that people who are interested in learning the
tools alternative to UNIX

it cannot be done unless the org which possess the copyright releases
the specification.. as an alternative to mp3 format, i guess OGG is
there. for DVD, i am not sure.

not necessarily. if normal people wanted to use, they should first
understand what linux is for and what it is not.

you are correct and they did because thats their business.

you are correct. you said people. whom does this people refers to? if
its includes me, then i am using fedora linux in my laptop for all my
needs.

M$ is willing to pay and get the copy rights of the format and
incorporate the same in the windows OS. Redhat,  Novell decided to
target corporate Desktop users  because they find that they could lot
of money. and corporate desktop users dont need mp3 support and all i
guess and also they wont listen to mp3 music or play DVD while at
work. If they are really targetting at end user desktop, they would
have done everything before itself. since they found that no revenue
would be generated in end user desktop, they are concentrating on
corporate users.

This will not happen and different people will have different

real)

the decision is left to the people whether they want to use
proprietory products or GNU Tools

i use lots of free to use / redistribute tools(for which source code
were available for download). GNU tools are growing and becoming
mature than before. Either way it is possible. the word Free can be
Free to use / redistribute or it may be free of cost. say tools like
GIMP are free to use / redistribute / free of cost. It depends on the
author setting the License for the software he writes.

you are going in a wrong directions. we are spreading about GNU /
Linux to create awareness among school students who are inturn very
much interested in learning stuff. Normal public wont care whether its
linux / windows. they all think about getting their work done. there
are some people who understands GNU / Linux and use them and some not.

Great and good going for freespire. i guess freespire is derived from
linspire. linspire is not free. i guess linspire didnt go well in the
market and that is the reason they have release the freespire version.
also restrictred formats which u have mentioned, source code for those
are available in public? all the tools incorporated in freespire are
GNU tools or comply with GPL license?

Its good if it happens. what are the criteria that makes best in
Desktop usage? Even i could say windows is difficult to use for people
like my father. they find it difficult to understand stuff in it or
even normal operations like opening a file, editing it, saving it etc.

In that case, how he can able to switch to linux? because end users
have different requirement and that is why companies like M$ releasing
versions by versions to satify the user.

Hi !

    For Remastering

If you have more time, Go for

www.slax.org
It's good for Live-cd or Live-USB.
It's based on slacware and it uses unionfs filesystem.
While creating livecd , i have faced the following problem...
It can not be installable.(3 months before... , i think now too.)
If you want to add some more packages, u have to download tar files
and make it as modules.
(They give scripts for this.)

If you have more patients, Go for

http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/Category:Remastering_Knoppix

If you need very urgent, Go for

http://www.pclinuxonline.com
 Download iso and Install pclinuxos.
 If you have broadband, update packages what ever u need.
Finally, give 'mklivecd' command, then get iso ...and burn it.

(If u need help in creating bootsplash, i will give hints.)

Bye

technically when u accidentally delete files , the data is not deleted only 
the link to it is deleted , so it must be possible to recover accidentially

Subject: [Ilugc] Remastering Knoppix or Mepis ?

Hi all,

Thanks for all your inputs.

I finally tried Mepis and the remastering was simple. But, I think I did a
mistake ;(. The Mepis Installer which I wanted to modify according to my
needs is not open source. One needs to ask the author/mepis creator -
Mr.Warren for re-using it.grrrrr.....Mepis Installer is too good and so
simple, but I have no idea why it is been kept closed.

I think I would next shift to PCLinuxOS or Knoppix. The reason why am not
going to SLAX is due to the package management. I am looking to adopt
Debian. If I choose a RPM distro (PCLOS),i would put smart in that
eventhough apt-get is available :)

Proprietary software can get exclusive licenses. Free software licenses 
such as GPL require compatible patent grants.

I dont know why u reboot to windows to listen to music. if u want to
creative zen to play ogg u should ask them and not blame / curse  GNU
/ linux tools lacking it. in that case, u should go to alternative
music system instead of creative. plugin for mp3 which u had installed
has basic stuff that play mp3 and not other effects. and i guess u r
wrong that u r expecting GNU / Linux to provide that. in that case u
do not understood what GNU / Linux provides.  If u need effects
equivalent to windows, then u must go for support oriented Linux / ask
creative to give binary drivers for linux.

FYI, i play these formats in my linux box  - mp3, wmv, avi, ogg, 3gp, mov.
i installed the needed software / plugins that is available in the
internet which are known to me.

for mp3 licensing check below links
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/14/mp3_tenth_birthday/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3
http://www.mp3licensing.com/help/index.html
http://www.iusmentis.com/copyright/nl/mp3/mp3legal/

and u could understand why distros not bundling mp3 supports. M$ have
paid to Thomson for  supporting since its wmv format didnt succeed
much. u could check the "Licensing and patent issues" column from the
url  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3

u could check the licensed companies list here
http://www.mp3licensing.com/licensees/index.asp

more over, till redhat linux 7.3, redhat was able to play mp3 by
default. but during the release of redhat 8, mp3 license have been
changed i.e even decoders have to pay licencse.

now i hope u would understand why winamp, Microsoft were able to play.

Hi Chaks,

 Great to see a post from you on desktop computing. 

My only concern is why does the linux community always tries to eat someone else' pie ? Desktop is/was/will be microsoft's arena - unless ofcourse someone like Redhat/Novell tried to build a worthy linux desktop - Frankly I don't see that happening anytime soon. 

Redhat is nothing short of a traitor - They gained immense popularity due to their free (as in cost & freedom) desktop version. But once they were under limelight, they abandoned their desktop users for their enterprise customers (If you think FC is any good - think again - it could have been the coolest distro - something that could have challenged MS - But not anymore). The truth is many adopt linux because it is free of cost and not because of its ideology.It is only the community that feels that way. To the normal user in India, it is just the cost factor that matters.


>> When companies like Novell,RedHat have decided their target are Desktop
>> Users, why would they not get exclusive rights like how M$ has ?. Sure,
>> there should be a way. If M$ is able to do things, why not WE.

As for this, all that I can say is no company is going to put money into a business that won't pay back. Lets assume Redhat (highly unlikely) buys all the rights for these patented technologies & releases it for no charge to the desktop users. So far so good. But what is Redhat gaining ? A great user base. But what is the point of an userbase that probably won't buy any of the desktop software - as there are free alternatives for almost everything else. 

Or maybe lets say Redhat releases the product and charges for each license (most of the patented techs expect royalties for each copy - so it is only natural)... do you think the average user will buy it ? No way. To him/her it is just  like paying for windows os. To them it really won't matter if it comes with source or not - After all how many average users have you seen who are willing to go in deep to the source level ? Maybe some in the linux community might buy a few copies to show solidarity.... Or maybe redhat could give the os for free and then run advertisements on your desktop :) But that would turn it into another MS.... 

My point is why at all are we targetting desktop computing at all. Linux' strength lies in the server market... and we have credible competitors there - AIX & open-solaris. That is the place where linux can outshine MS, IBM & Sun. 

Linux might become a victim of its own success. Concerted efforts in a specific direction yields better results than trying to progress in multiple directions.


regards,
Hassan

Thats running in my mind for more than 6 months. How far GNU/Linux is gonna
compromise on the Desktop Market ?

The people who are going to use GNU/Linux as their Desktop arent geeks(like
us). They do not even know what a "command line tool" and no way you can
make him/her to learn, as he/she would tell, why would he/she has to learn
!.

We do know that there are patent rights with Mp3,DVD etc., There are no
support for many plugin formats for the same reason too. If one needs such
things to be done, he/she is redirected to pages like ,

   - For Ubuntu 
   - For Novell/SuSE
   - For RedHat

Dont these have to work out of the box if you really want it to be used by
the normal people ?

Yes, companies need to compromise and thats what M$ had done during the
start (Gud or Bad,one has to admit).

I would say this is one of the reasons, people fear of adopting GNU/Linux
into Desktops.

When companies like Novell,RedHat have decided their target are Desktop
Users, why would they not get exclusive rights like how M$ has ?. Sure,
there should be a way. If M$ is able to do things, why not WE.

Take a GNU/Linux Desktop Oriented Distro, list out things what would be
required to make it still better(in terms of out of the box support), let us
prepare the list, take survey, and submit online the results.This will help
the companies understand that there are quite large number of people needing
these requirements.(I am sure they would know already)

There are many other things also that we need to compromise. There are many
proprietary products in Linux itself (like, CrossOverOffice) which are great
deal for Desktop Users. If we neglect them,and just strive for only FREE(as,
Free of Cost), I think the situation would be the same and sure normal
people would not be able to use GNU/Linux.

Am not at all telling that GNU/Linux is not growing or there are only
pitfalls. These issues are something we need to keep track of.And my kind
advice would be to spread the word FREE as in FREE TO USE/REDISTRIBUTE and
not as in FREE OF COST. That leads into a different scenario.

We are doing a good job in spreading about GNU/Linux by conducting LDDs at
various institutions. Is there any way to conduct LDD for the normal public
?. If so, then , it would be great show and sure our voices will reach the
Public, Media.

One of the main reason for me to be with Freespire  ,
is their Vision on how to make GNU/Linux best in the Desktop Usage. They
have legal rights in giving out the restricted
formatsout
of the
box.Please dont think am here to spread about Freespire. These things are
the basic needs for a Desktop User.

The future of GNU/Linux is good if we make GNU/Linux the best in Desktop
Usage as stated by Eric Raymond.

Thats what i wrote in my mail. We cannot ask people. If it doesnt play out
of the box, the User would check for alternates. You cannot blame the User
for this.

I have specifically mentioned that the Companies need to make this happen,
which also tells that no blame is put on GNU/Linux tools.

in that case, u should go to alternative

Thats not the User's concern.

FYI, i play these formats in my linux box  - mp3, wmv, avi, ogg, 3gp, mov.

Are these out of the box once you install?.Will a normal person be able to
do all these stuffs?

Hi,

 I know about Ubuntu. But it is even close to windows - and by the looks of it, it will lag far behind when Vista is released. So either Ubuntu needs to take chaks prescription to be the desktop competitor for MS - but again the cost factor will rear its ugly head.... nothing we can do about that... after all patent protects innovations & the rights of the creator - we cann't really blame them for trying to make money out of their own ideas...

Apart from that I agree with the rest of your post :)

regards,
Hassan

user checks for alternates. i agree. may be the user does not aware of
playing music using GNU tools. GNU tools become popular by word of
mouth i guess or by email / mailling list / usent groups. say for eg.
i am windows user, i want to play videos. if i dont know, i will ask
people who knows windows better. same can be applied for using GNU
tools. i guess there are lots of people in ILUGC who use linux OS for
doing basic stuff.

companies never do that unless they get paid. their aim is not to give
software for free. their aim is to make profit.

its users concern. to say this, u gave VCD player which plays only
VCD. and not DVD. if u r trying to play DVD on VCD  player, will it
play? the user should know that and should go for DVD player that
plays both VCD and DVD. this is what i told

all these format plays out of the box. i am a normal person when i

 i just installed the necessary software.

this will change only if mp3 is open sourced. i guess mp3 will never

by the looks of vista, it lags behind. i guess fedora core 5 some what
resembles vista kind of look. why i am saying about ubuntu is that,
many people in my company who have windows as  background tried ubuntu
and said that they are satisfied with ubuntu linux.

Patent is evil. say no to software patents. :)

This message seems confused.

If organizations change their product strategy to target a set of 
consumers which according to you would make sense better anyway, then it 
should be a bad idea to do just that while contributing to open source

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/RedHatContributions

If the "linux community" shouldnt eat someone else's pie there isnt any 
need for Fedora Core to challenge MS. Note that there is a number of 
people out there who havent ever used computers and that number is 
currently larger than MS users. .

A project's success is evaluated against their objectives and Fedora 
Core's objectives doesnt include any ideas about competing against any 
vendors.

corrct me if i am wrong ........... if i have a mp3 player (hardware one) 
which used to decode mp3 ,manufactured before decoding of mp3 needed 
licensing then am i breaking license if i decode mp3 with this old player 
???? if no , then will i break license if i decode mp3 with a software 
module written compiled and released even before mp3 decoding needed 
licensing ??? if i dont ,,, then maybe we can bundle older decoders that 
supported mp3 with our linux distro :)

Hi,

Patents are evil in the sense that they block further innovations that extend the basic idea without the creator's consent. However they also protect the creator's ownership. So I would say they are a necessary evil :) We cann't untangle ourselves from it completely.

Hassan

by the looks of vista, it lags behind. i guess fedora core 5 some what
resembles vista kind of look. why i am saying about ubuntu is that,
many people in my company who have windows as  background tried ubuntu
and said that they are satisfied with ubuntu linux.

Patent is evil. say no to software patents. :)

Well, simply becoz one needs to buy Linspire, you cannot tell it is bad.

All the GNU/Linux tools have the source and one can download the Linspire
Source Code CD too.And no way Linspire didnt do well in the Market. I have
regular contacts with Linspire CEO. Freespire is the outcome of just another
Business Model.

u could still use redhat 7.3 which has mp3 support by default since it
has decoder before the mp3 licensing changed.

if mp3 format is changed to adopt the new licencse, then u must use
the new players that accepts new license

Sure it is... In India!

AFAIK, we don't have anything in our laws allowing software patents. So, 
anything that Thompson wants to charge us is essentially illegal, because 
India doesn't recognize their patent to begin with! ;-)

Anyway, I have a Creative Zen (beautiful device, all other considerations 
aside), and I use libnjb (libnjb.sourceforge.net) and Amarok (amarok.kde.org) 
to keep it in sync with my system - in fact, I don't even use the Zen in 
Windows anymore, because libnjb and Amarok do everything I want them to do 
with it (well, most things, anyway - and I have only myself to blame for 
other things - I'm supposed to be the guy maintaining the Amarok NJB 
plugin :-) )...

I'd suggest that you use something like Amarok and the Xine engine to play 
mp3s. I haven't had any trouble with that particular front for years now...

Which has absolutely nothing to do with software patents. LMI protects

Well I didn't mean look & feel of windows - In that category I love KDE more than XP... What I really meant was that the usability/user experience that windows provides over any linux desktop to the average non-geek user.

No, that wouldnt work. Patents are not tied to the software copyright 
licenses, authors or time of release. After a patent is filed and 
approved any software that uses the process described in the patent 
would be infringing it unless the implementation has a patent license or 
someone manages to overthrows the patent or until the patent expires.

I agree on this.. I think usability can be measured by the number of
times the user has to reach for the command line. The raw fact of life
is that windows and osx users rarely *have* to use the CLI, whereas
linux users always keep a terminal open at all times.

I realise the power of the CLI (and that is one of the reasons i prefer
linux to windows), but to a more general user, the CLI would hold little
interest.

Greetings!

The photos taken during "FLOSSAGE 2006", between
August 19-20, 2006 at Jaya Engineering College,
Thiruninravur, Tamil Nadu, India can be viewed from:

http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album35

I shall make a CD copy of the photos (high resolution)
and send it to Harish (Secretary, Jaya Engineering
College GNU/Linux Campus Club). 

Thanks to Harish for coordinating and helping us
around.

I must congratulate Prof. Kumaran for doing a very
good job in organizing the whole event. 

Thanks to the management, faculty, students of Jaya
Engineering college for the wonderful hospitality
offered.

Students were very enthusiastic about FLOSS. It was
something very new to them, and they were very eager
to learn it and try it. 

I was particulary impressed by the 'Blender team' who
picked it up so easily, and were doing cool
animations! If we can continue to guide them, they
will definitely make good contributions to FLOSS.

Thanks to the other ILUGC, NRCFOSS volunteers too. I
had a great time!

Best regards,

SK

Binand

I will try my best to be polite in my response. I don't understand what you mean by "Utter nonsense" ? Do you really know the level of importance redhat attaches to FC ? Fedora doesn't get the kind of funding that it requires from redhat. If it had, it probably would be doing a much better job than Ubuntu. Now don't think I'm against Ubuntu - I just believe that redhat had everything to deliver a great desktop distro that might have competed successfully with windows.

As for Enterprise distro, I would be thrilled to see it being used by a desktop user - if that is what you mean. I said pretty clearly that they have alienated their desktop user base - not the enterprise customers - after all who will alienate a base that pays so much ? :) So it is not a surprise that their enterprise version is really cool. What I wanted to emphasize is that they got popular because of their user friendly desktop distro (I loved RH 8 & 9)... But once they had enough corporate customers, they sidestepped their desktop users...

And to become "patriot", they must treat the fedora project on par with their enterprise distro and fund it accordingly... 

regards,
Hassan

Some sources for this would be nice. Do you have any references to the
amount of funding Fedora gets, where it is lacking and how this
compares with Novell/Opensuse?

Hi,

I don't have the exact figures (in $). I have to admit that. But I can provide links that clearly show how redhat alienated their user base. This is not the complete list. I will get back with many more links. For the time being, please check out this link:

 http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/editorial_13
 
 A few interesting lines from the article:
 
 A number of things happened in the following years (1997 to 2005). Here are a few of them, in chronological order: the packaged version of Red Hat Linux flopped (why would anybody buy it, if you can download it? Plus, yes, it was overpriced...). Red Hat went public, and started having a number of investors that wanted to see good, realistic plans to make money?which meant focusing more on the corporate market. Then, the split: Fedora came along, but it was underfunded and the ?community involvement? was patchy and disorganised. Eventually, Red Hat effectively abandoned its desktop audience, to focus on the more lucrative corporate market.....

I am convinced that Red Hat is now starting to realise that losing their desktop users didn?t just mean ?losing the suckers who didn?t pay a cent anyway? (this is not a quote, by the way), because a lot of those ?suckers? were system administrators, who will soon have to decide between Red Hat Linux and Ubuntu Server. And when you use Ubuntu Server as your home system, the choice really can go either way.

Check out the following links where Fedora Project Lead Max Spevack tries hard to win back the user-community by saying that fedora was always production quality (even if not publicly declared by redhat from 2003)... Looks like Redhat is finally facing the heat from Ubuntu - not only in the desktop market but also server market (this is really great news for me - serves them right for sidestepping the desktop users...)

http://asay.blogspot.com/ (Aug 18 entry)...
http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/17/177220&from=rss

And guess what ? Redhat is not planning to release fedora to the community as a separate foundation. They want to tightly keep fedora under their control - ofcourse they cite different reasons for the decision. Looks like they are finally seeing light at the end....

regards,
Hassan

Redhat should take fedora and release that as official version with

Fedora doesn't get the kind of funding that it requires from redhat. If it had, it probably would be doing a much better job than Ubuntu. Now don't think I'm against Ubuntu - I just believe that redhat had everything to deliver a great desktop distro that might have competed successfully with windows.

Fedora now under the control of fedora foundation which has
independend board of directors who control it. fedora community urged
this need and that is the reason why redhat made fedora, a independent
organisation.

I said pretty clearly that they have alienated their desktop user base - not the enterprise customers - after all who will alienate a base that pays so much ? :) So it is not a surprise that their enterprise version is really cool. What I wanted to emphasize is that they got popular because of their user friendly desktop distro (I loved RH 8 & 9)... But once they had enough corporate customers, they sidestepped their desktop users...

Yes, you are right - if they are not overwritten they are definitely 
there.. but the problem is.. I won't exactly know where they are in my
80 GB hard disk. I can try to recover some text files if I know some 
unique words I had used in those files by grepping but if my files are 
binary how would i know if, say.. "0F FF DE 6B 6E 73 76...." is a unique
byte combination that occurs only in my lost mp3 file?

I am learning the hard way. Don't forget to make your backups!

Strongly agree! It is much better to discuss EE topics
here as there is no separate hardware list in Chennai.

So please let us discuss this on the list. Sometime
somewhere google will pick it up and it will help
someone. So think of that!

Girish

Sure! We are all here only to help!

Interesting to see that you attribute slowness or
"hanging" or freezing to viruses and worms. 

I have never heard of any virus in the UNIX world. Not
even once. There are however worms, trapdoors, Trojan
horses blah blah blah. 

Certainly not some Windoze like virus that slows down
the machine. In fact one of the main reasons folks
prefer Linux is for this fact; that it is completely
free of viruses.

Also mischief mongers don't want to hurt linux users,
so the possibility of there being future viruses also
is slim.

Worms are a totally different beasts however. They
usually cause havoc in the network like routers or
cause denial of service attacks. At best I think a
linux "virus" may hog your bandwidth, nothing more. 

Anyway to answer ur question, you should check whether
you have setup sufficient swap space, try using hdparm
for your hard disk(usually not recommended) or use a
lightweight browser like netscape or even galeon if
your machine is an old one. 

HTH,
Girish

It was good experience to spend time with these students. 

On behalf of ILUGC I thank the management,Prof.Kumaran, faculty,
Harish and all students for the wonderful moments we had.

Similar to blender team I am impressed with apache and security 
team. I see future FOSS developers in them.

How is that related to funding? Thats a build system and man power 
issue. If you believe that the security features and the speed of 
updates is not up to par check again.

http://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/Features
http://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/Status

If you want funding details, check http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Accounting

Bandwidth costs alone works out to a couple of million dollars every year.

Wow. The refutal for my claim is the blog of a Microsoft shill.

I suppose he has an explanation for the fact that RHEL3 doesn't have a
single remote-exploitable vulnerability yet in its 3 years of
existence, whereas Windows 2k3 currently has several available
(including the current favourite MS06-040).

All you have to do is set the appropriate keymap. I
think you can use the shell command kbdcontrol or
something similar. Do a "apropos kbd"

Basically what happens is when you press and release a
key, an interrupt is generated and the kernel reads
the scancode from the keyboard buffer(usually 16
bytes). In your case that is happening perfectly. So
it is good news.

However it should be read by a user space application.
There also seems to be a package called hotkeys which
may help you. The version I downloaded is 0.5.7.1.

I have not been there, done that. 

So this is what I can do at best!

regards,
Girish

Tucked in a corner of my (vernacular, online) newspaper was this
interesting bit (which I later hunted up in The Hindu's website):

http://www.hindu.com/2006/08/21/stories/2006082121320300.htm

State IT Mission: Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan inaugurates
seminar on `Free software for the development of Kerala,' Hotel
Residency Tower, 9 a.m.

Remember that VS has been a strong advocate of using Free Software in
governance and a staunch opponent of Microsoft's pressure/bribery
tactics with state governments in India.

Anybody from Thiruvananthapuram knows what transpired at the seminar?

The Apache team were pros. They call themselves
"Revmakx".

They comprise of V.Vinodh David, Joseph John,
M.Karthik, and S.Yuvaraj.

They have coded the following websites:

http://www.checkwithdirect.com
http://www.xlmixtapes.com/citymixtapes/index.php

I am looking forward to seeing their implementation of
jec.ac.in running on GLAMP.

Agreed that it's not related to funding. The point I'm trying to raise
is that of "importance". Fedora hasn't yet received the update to
Firefox, whereas RHEL has. The problem is that there is just *one* guy
who is taking care of mozilla related packages (that includes Firefox
and TB) for all distro-variants from redHat(including FC). Fedora has
a huge community(probably the largest) , why can't the maintainership
of the firefox/thunderbird packages be given to the community members
if RH feels it's being under-staffed and their developers overworked.

The problem is that RH doesn't want to give up control of Fedora.

Guys,

I really don't follow the thread and I definitely
don't want to sidetrack it either. 

My two cents would be that few months ago there was
some big furore over patents and media codecs or some
such thing in Europe and since mplayer is from Hungary
, there was a page citing that unless something was
done things would go wrong or anything. 

As far as I am concerned mplayer is the be all end all
of all media playing in any OS. It is a breeze to
compile if required and you can hack it though the
code is not so well written or organized.

But the bottom line is it can play any damn file on
earth, be it audio, video, television, creating
successive screenshots from videos, or making your own
mng video.. It is simply amazing, mind blowing!

There is no equivalent. 

Another program worthy of mention of course is ffmpeg.
It is so cool , you can convert any format to any
other with a simple command line, audio or video. 

mplayer has the sort of stance that I would take. I
don't care about patents or legalese, I am a hacker
and I can reverse engineer if reqd, I will give users
what they want....

So just read "man mplayer" and also its html
documentation. 

I am yet to find out what mplayer cannot do! :-)

The problem with RMS, ESR today is that they are old-war-generals with
no cause to fight for. When FSF/OSF was started they played a very
important role, but with FOSS becoming pervasive in today's computing
scenario and with the abundance of FOSS developers , the need for
strong-willed ethic/morality based visionaries has decreased.

Is it good or bad ? Well, that depends on what kind of a personality
one is. FOSS today needs more people like Linus, Miguel de Icaza and
Mark Shuttleworth. People who are fighting on purely
business/technological merits rather than on the "ethical" front.

I'm not saying we should compromise on ethics, just that the ethics
argument is now well accepted in the computing world and is no more a
cause to fight for. the GPL has withstood the test of time and FOSS is
no more a activity done by bearded-sandal wearing hippies.

In short, stop harping and stop coding...

I don't know anything about copyrights or licenses. I
will send the slides to the list, you attach whatever
license you deem appropriate. :-)

Btw, slides are dead matter. It is the magnetism of
the speaker that matters, the interaction that goes on
between the audience, the dialogues etc...

So as Hassan requested, it will be great if someone
could arrange for video taping the sessions. It is
important to bear these things in mind.

1) Audio is much more important than video, so make
sure you record the audio clearly

2) Video should focus not only on me but also on the
audience, especially when asking questions

These days professional grade video cameras are
available for a few hundred dollars. Could someone
arrange for one ? Also someone has to hold the camera,
who will do that? Can Bharathi arrange for one?

Once the video is available, I can take care of the
tech part. Like uploading it to google videos or
making a podcast available...

I seriously think video is going to be a 100 times
more useful than the slides since slides will just be
certain bullet points without the details...

Whereas video will be live and it will truly make the
tutorial sessions really useful for anyone interested
in learning these topics in future.

Again I want this to be completely free.

regards,
Girish

I would have to disagree with that. There are few people who understand 
the complete details on either the ethical side or the technical 
arguments completely. Both of these are worth repeating to all the 
constant influx of new people flowing in.

Patents issues, DRM etc have become relatively major issues recently and 
unless you continue to reflect upon those changes in licenses and the 
community in general it has the potential to severely curb what Free 
software can do and it has already has in many instances.

If the industry can work purely based on technical arguments that might 
be a good thing but thats not where the competing interests play. If one 
ignore that they stand to lose.

Actually Firefox and Thunderbird received the updates on the same day 
the "rant" was posted and the updates were being prepared even before 
the mailing list discussion started.

Thats a pretty fair question but it requires you to understand more of 
the details. So here we go.

There are number of related issues.

Fedora Core is Red Hat maintained and has 2000 plus packages which is 
provided in the media (CD/DVD).

Fedora Extras has 3000 plus packages the larger community has access 
towards and maintain. It is not available in media and has a rolling 
updates model.

Fedora Core shares the build system with RHEL right from the Red Hat 
Linux days and the buildsystem happens to be pretty much tied to the 
rest of the Red Hat development infrastructure.

When Fedora Extras needed a buildsystem, Dan William from Red Hat (who 
originally wrote and maintains Network Manager) wrote up a mock based 
buildsystem.

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Plague

Fedora Core recently moved into a mock based build system too called 
"brew" and since it is available on media a release has to be made and 
brew does more than just build packages. It also takes care of many of 
the details around release management and unless the community has 
access to these details, patching and building a new package in Fedora 
Core needs to be done within Red Hat.  Firefox and Thunderbird are 
particularly tricky packages since upstream doesnt work with vendor 
security on many occasions and patches needs to be hand picked and 
rolled out.

Moving Firefox to Fedora Extras is not a option since it is the default 
browser for Fedora and needs to be in Fedora Core for now.


> 
> The problem is that RH doesn't want to give up control of Fedora.
> 

Not really. The real issue in this instance is how to get community to 
do maintenance within Fedora Core? If you read the thread you cited 
further, this was discussed there.

Moving more of the packages into Fedora Extras gets them community 
access and this is being over the last few releases. Moving them is not 
easy since end users using a previous release need a upgrade path. 
Fedora Extras was not available during installation time for previous 
releases. Fedora Core 5 Anaconda switched to using Yum internally. In 
Fedora Core 6, Anaconda will have the ability to access any Yum software 
repository during installation including Fedora Extras so now users have 
a more easy upgrade path even when packages move from Fedora Core into 
Fedora Extras and vice versa.

KDE for example is one of the packages planned to be moved into Fedora 
Extras for better community access

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/UnleashKDE

More work is being done on getting the community to access the build 
system and release management infrastructure so external maintainers can 
work in Fedora Core.  A related thing is moving into a distributed 
source code management into of CVS and the details are available at

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/Schedule
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure/VersionControl

Hang on. We will get there within a release or two.

It is $2500 for 10 seats, or $250 per seat. That is with Satellite integration.

For individuals, pricing starts at $179 for basic edition.

Compare this with the $300 price tag for Windows XP Professional:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00022PTI4/sr=8-5/qid=1156148356/ref=pd_bbs_5/002-9152081-4701642?ie=UTF8

Mind you, you will have to shell out more money for an office suite.

In any case, discussion on the pricing is irrelevant. Nobody in the
know expects Free Software to be "free as in beer".

Ok. Good to know that you have made progress. However
you seem to not want remastering, you seem to want to
make a liveCD. In that case just spend some time
learning about the boot process, the El Torito CDROM
booting specs, initrd, blah blah blah. 

Then you may also want to to for a bootable DVD if
reqd. Use squashfs or unionfs and go for some window
manager like XFCE or Windowmaker if you want to
differentiate yourself. 

Package management? No need to think twice. Stick to
deb...

IOW I am saying you have to figure out how to make
your own Debian based liveCD or liveDVD.

If you end up learning a lot, make a howto available
for us or still better add it to
www.debian.org/documentation website.

All the best!

Girish

The problem the way I see it then is Fedora is tied down to RH's build
system _currently_ . But aren't the software-package versions on FC
and RHEL different ? How does the build system manage this ?

I guess this is where the friction is currently. Isn't it possible to
get (secured) access for community maintainers into Fedora Core ?

* Will community-maintainership be restricted to only Fedora-Extra's ?
* Can replication of package-building take place where a clone-build
is done on Fedora-Extra's for firefox/thunderbird and then placed in a
"testing" zone for the community to try it out. The FC(RH) maintainer
can then use that as the Fedora Core package if he is comfortable with
the test. I guess this was what was suggested on the discussion but
giving community access to the build machines for security-related
packages would also be beneficial. I guess rawhide is there for the
unstable-purpose but I'm not sure if the community is involved there ?

Not all of Fedora. Just Fedora Core. Fedora Core and Red Hat Enterprise 
Linux are just different branches and there are different versions of 
Fedora Core and Red Hat enterprise Linux managed by the same system. 
Heck, managing all the differences in versions and details are what the 
build systems *is* supposed to do anyway. No big surprises there.

Not currently. There is no china wall between Fedora Core and Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux in the way the build system works and it is not easy to 
set that up while not making it more difficult for people who work on 
Fedora within Red Hat. It is not just infrastructure issues. For 
example, Red Hat cant disclose sensitive details like NDA and business 
contracts associated with Red Hat Enterprise Linux to be known to the 
external community (which would be in violation of agreements) and these 
details are associated with the build system since there are very 
complex US laws (Sarbanes-Oxley commonly referred to as SOX compliance) 
that require you to keep a record of say all source code changes 
developed under a contract and things like that.

In short, the easier way out is to setup external build system machines 
for Fedora not associated with other products. It was deemed too 
disruptive to consider with the release of both Fedora Core 6 and Red 
Hat Enterprise Linux 5 in progress. The plan is start tackling this for 
Fedora Core 7.

Beyond bug reports and patches to bugzilla, currently yes.

Wont work out currently since Fedora Core along with Red Hat Enterprise 
Linux is build on more architectures such as IBM mainframes though 
Fedora for mainframes is not a public release. Red Hat does that for 
continuity between releases. The community of course doesnt have easy 
access to large and costly mainframes and the build system doesnt have a 
easy way to exclude architectures.

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.redhat.fedora.advisory-board/352

It is based on the idea that using the exact same source to build 
binaries for all architectures would be better for QA and release 
management but such restrictions would mean that what builds on Fedora 
Extras doesnt necessary build in Fedora Core though vice versa is true.

  I guess this was what was suggested on the discussion but
> giving community access to the build machines for security-related
> packages would also be beneficial. 

In the case of security issues it is thorny because these usually go to 
a relatively closed group first called vendor-sec before the details are 
released to the public after sometime. These vendors then coordinate and 
release fixes. This arrangement is called "responsible" disclosure.

For Fedora, Red Hat acts as the gateway in vendor-sec and gets early to 
security issues. However vendor-sec wont work with random community 
members and the agreements prevent any vendors working within the group 
to let anyone outside it have access to the details for a particular 
time period.

The biggest concern here is about not wanting people to not turn around 
and create exploits with sensitive security issues instead of fixing 
them.  There are ways around that. When Fedora has a history of 
community people working on and fixing security issues these maintainers 
can be setup up to directly work with vendor-sec and take care of Fedora 
security issues.

Some of these efforts are in progress at 
https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/fedora-security-list

Details at http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security

I guess rawhide is there for the

Community people test and report bugs but if we are talking about 
package maintainers,  Fedora development tree (Rawhide) is maintained by 
the same developers as Fedora Core (and even Red Hat Enterprise Linux in 
most cases). Similarly between Fedora extras-devel and extras.

This move would benefit KDE too since the main maintainer taking over is 
Rex Dieter (Primary developer behind http://kde-redhat.sf.net 
repository). He is a also a fellow board member and is in the Fedora 
Packaging and Fedora Extras steering committee's and already maintains 
several KDE related packages in Fedora Extras.

Sending mails are very easy. You can either use a
local MTA or use a remote MTA. Local MTA is easy to
setup.

Figure out how to install exim, postfix or sendmail
for Suse.

Then make sure it is running with 
nc localhost 25

If it greets u u r set.

however receiving mails will not work. 

Sending is easy, get that right first. We will
worry about recving later. 

Best,

Is it a necessity that when a new linux user is born he is told the

These don't effect the joe-desktop-user at all. Today's catch phrase
seems to be "It just works and I don't care how it works!".

There has to be a well defined path on how the battle will be fought
depending on the occasion. If the adversary needs to be conforted on
ethical issues then we need to shift into ethical mode. If the
technology/business mode is required we need to shift into it
correspondingly. The thing is, today's battles on FOSS are shifting
more towards the tech-mode rather than the ethics mode. Basically, we
have played the ethical card multiple times (and at times scared
people away). It's now time to play the tech-cards and those will give
us better results(user-base) than the ethics-cards.

Ok ur wish is granted. 

But who is going to take the video and who is going to

Without that I am helpless.

Great article..
It was interesting article of an M$ user switching to linux..

In the category of user he have given in the article as

*1. The Absolute Novice*

*2. The ex-Windows Power User or normal windows user*

*3. The *nix Expert or Starter unix user
*

I will come under the 2nd type of user. not only me. AFAIK, many people
around me come under 2nd type of user. 1st type of users are people who dont
even use thier systems frequently... so they can use whatever of they
prefer. 3rd type of users are not many. This is what that is given in the
essay even.
Under which user type you come into..

The analogy doesnt fit. Free software and the ideas surrounding it is 
not religious epics. On the other hand if you a student studying 
religions it would be a pretty good to know these epics rather than 
discard them as useless artifacts of age old minds. In general its a 
good idea to understand how things has evolved especially if you are 
directly benefiting from those ideas. We dont study history as students 
for nothing.

Setting aside the fact that every user is affected by different set of 
things and so called "joe desktop user" is a mythical non existent 
caricature, DRM is something that does affect typical desktop users 
playing videos or listening to songs (Why am I being restricted that the 
songs I brought can only being played 5 times in a year?). Patent issues 
do too indirectly (why cant I play mp3 or watch encrypted DVD's?). Our 
value systems are not tied to what typical desktop users care about and 
doing so is a very narrow view point . Linux is flexible enough to a 
broad variety of needs.

Right. It is just that ignoring political issue like software patents or 
trying to solve them technically doesnt work.  Legal problems might very 
well render Free software unusable in several places. If you dont care 
about that you drive yourself into a niche.

In principle if you are scared by ethical arguments then you need to 
understand that aspect better rather than question people whose value 
systems are different than yours. A large amount of the community has 
got involved got into it because of the ethical side of the argument. 
Sure, there are technical side effects of the system and that has its 
place. One shouldnt brush off the technical benefits but its only fair 
to take into other beliefs into consideration especially when there are 
more and more non-technical issues affecting Free software.

The default kernel in sarge is 2.4. For SATA support try to install
with 2.6 kernel by
typing

linux26

while booting from first cd.

Better try debian testing to get newer drivers.

We have been discussing these things in two threads :)

If you ask me, today , people are expecting Solutions. They are more
inclined to the nature that , If they insert DVD/VCD/MP3 disc/Audio CD it
just has to play. They are not even bothered of DRM or patents. They are
asking for out of the box support. If you tell them about DRM and other
stuffs, they are not going to listen to us. I have faced such problems with
many people :(.

But yes, how far GNU/Linux can come down to these patents and other stuffs
is still a mystery.

Message-ID: <a54a308e0608210500m5279c74ar2f9d28ff3318d9f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We host Thick Servers and Thin Clients.We had planned a lot with Linux
Servers but now we have to deploy in Windows Server 2003.However, next month
the same deployment is going to be started in Linux(most probably, we will
be getting SLES).

I was checking in Windows Terminal Services and one point hit me directly
and i dont know how we are going to implement in Linux as we havent found a
solution for this till today.

Here is an extract from Microsoft Terminal Service Document,

Terminal Services is a technology that lets users run Microsoft(r)
Windows(r)-based applications on a remote Windows Server 2003-based computer.
In a Terminal Server-based computing environment, all application execution
and data processing occur on the server. In a load balanced environment, a
farm of terminal servers have incoming session connections distributed in a
balanced manner across the servers in the farm. The session directory (SD)
keeps a list of sessions indexed by user name, and allows a user to
reconnect to the terminal server where the user's disconnected session
resides and resume that session.

Now, in Linux, we do have VNC(with several encoding algorithms) and one
problem is solved.What about the Session Management?. We have not got a
simple solution on this. Its like this,

   - User logs into the Server
   - User gets the login screen and he enters his username and pwd
   - Server checks for the last login and saved session
   - If any saved session, start the saved session
   - If there is no any saved session, start a new session

In Windows we are actually opening Sessions across many Terminal Servers
which are put up in a single Server Cluster with Network Load Balancing
enabled.

I would be happy if people could give me input on the above and I need to
implement this in Linux, mainly Session Management.Somehow, it works
directly in Windows Server 2003 ;(

Thanks.

Products produce "solutions". You are free to cater to such people 
moving into short term benefits but claiming that everyone is expecting 
such solutions or that only technical arguments are the valid ones while 
taking other aspects of the system as granted are going to create *more* 
issues like the above.  There is no way to implement a Free software 
player for a proprietary codec restricted by patents.  There is no way 
to solve issues like software patents in a technical way since it is 
fundamentally not a technical problem at all. If your "solution" is to 
include non-free software, go ahead. Good luck to you.

This thread is too long to resist participating. I think Rahul has
explained things in the best possible way as you can see above.


We need both technical and ethical. They are two sides of the same
coin. For those who don't care about ethical issues please look at
the piracy rate especially among academics. All those who use illegal
copies are technically staisfied with them. What is wrong in talking
about ethical issues and advocating shifting to FOSS?

In the end I feel each user should see FOSS in his/her own angle -
may be cost, may be technical or may be ethical.

Raman.P

i am not sure how it is done but i think you can analyse overheads and know 
which is a mp3 which is a text file ......... or there is pattern and i 
think you can recognize the end of a file by the EOF character ......... if 
its possible in windows its possible in linux also just that one of us have

there is something called interrupt vector table and i think the keyboard 
interupt is either 8 or 9 . you need to place your function in memory and 
change the address to in the ivt to your fuctions address and then when a 
key is pressed check the scancode if it is anything other than the key you 
want to monitor call the function stored in the previous ivt space for the 
particular interrupt  , otherwise perform the function that you wanted your 
key to perform....

interrupt and ivt are bios concepts so i think it must work on linux also  
but i havent tried it.

Though I don't know easy to use software which implements session
management in X with facility to attach/reattach. Few in this
direction are

a.xmove: This software is not longer maintained. But is available in
debian. This can be used to move X session from one host to another.

b.Look at this article: Screen + ratpoison for restoring X session

I think Solaris Sparc machines directly supported
session resumption with a keyboard key in the CDE
desktop environment. One day my friend demonstrated it
to me. I have also been able to save sessions in
Windowmaker. It is trivial to do in others also, but
there are complications like saving passwords for
restarting sessions with remote machines or even for
the root user.

There are also thin client implementations for FreeBSD
and I saw a recent thread in that list. But that is by
exporting the display alone, they weren't actually
bothered by session management. 

IOW, nothing that Windows 2003 server can do exists
tha t linux cannot. :-)

HTH,
Girish

The Solaris Ray clients have implemented it.Storing Window Manager Session
is different from what am trying to do.

isnt thin clients all or mostly abt terminal servers in linux ........... 
anyway windows has AD which makes maintaing sessions easy by having group 
policy etc but in linux i think you can have log in scripts and log off 
scripts ...... which will load and save on logging in and logging out, the 
various session details to and from a simple file.

I don't think this is correct. Linux does its hardware probing on its
own and does not rely on the BIOS to tell it what hardware you have.

why are you talking abt bios here ???
i just responded to a mial where he was not able to get his hardware

ofcourse all hardware are designed to be recognised by the bios

no thats right because though linux does hardware probing on its own what 
assigns the io addresses is the bios ..... so unless bios assigns a irq and 
other stuff like that linux cant probe through but its not the other way 
ruond ...... if bios detects doesnt mean linux has to detect

Maintaining Sessions is not by default provided in GNu/Linux distributions
:(. When i login for the first time, i should get an empty session (please
dont confuse this with the window manager session, like, KDE Session
Management). Then onwards, whenever i log in , i should get my last session.
For example, if i had brwosing firefox and checking the yahoo main page and
suddenly the network fails. Then when the network is up, i log into the
server, the session i should get is where i left, the firefox with yahoo
main page opened.This works like a charm with Windows Server 2003.

Now, this becomes complex when i bring in Server Clusters and Terminal
Servers wherein, the Session can be started at any Terminal Server where the
load is less(Network Load Balancing).Again, Windows 2003 is providing good
support for this.

Is OpenMosix having these features?. Its cluster oriented.

what is your sata controller is it ata 8237 ???/ if its different probably 
you need another driver .......
but also make sure of partition not found means a undetected drive or a 
corrupted partition table , i aint sure.

Hi all,
 
 I am using SuSE 9.3 as a proxy server, i need to check : website name which used by the client machines. 
 Some client machines are windows XP and some client machines are SuSE 9.3.
 All under one network (192.168.0.X)
 
 Is there any command or any solution for this ?

Why don't you try the default kernel ie., 2.4. I had the same problem
yesterday when I tried to install debian in a Dell inspirion 6000
laptop which had and ATAxxx type 80 G harddisk. After going through
many forums and lot of googling I found that debian install without a
glitch if we try the 2.4 kernel ie., the default one, in dell
inspirion and it worked. Also I found from many forums that support
for ATA type hard disks was somehow broken in the development tree
after >2.4.27 kernel development... May be it may be resumed in some
latest kernel development trees.

Also I met with the same problem some one year before while I was in
college trying to install debian in newly procured HP desktop machines
which had SATA harddisks. Then also we used 2.4 kernel from the debian
installer and the installation went smoothly ie., the SATA disk was
detected.

Its always easy to compile 2.6 kernel from this point once you have
your 2.4 kernel installed.

Another problem was when I found it difficult to install debian in a
HP ML350 machine some 4 months back which is a server grade machine.
This time the problem is different everything went fine and it failed
in the last step ie., during the grub installation. This was basically
due to the naming convention which HP followed for naming the raided
disk, they call it something like this /dev/cciss0, /dev/cciss1, etc.
Due to the above naming convention grub searched for /dev/hda which
was unavailable. I was trying hard to get a solution for the above and
I got one which involved getting into the terminal during the
installation changing the device.map file to point to /dev/cciss for
hd0. Some time later the easiest solution I got was to get the latest
installer build by the smartest and fastest working debian community,
which solved the naming convention problem introduced by HP.

So I ll suggest 2 solutions:
1) Try installing with 2.4 the default kernel shipped with Debian 3.1
2) Else go for downloading the latest installer from debian.org

I would recomend 2) because for every new type of hardware that is
available in market debian guys comes with a fix in a month or two. So
give it a try :)

No..no..no! this is not a Linux Vs Windows thing at all. You have 
misunderstood me.. I think you missed the quote from ext3 developer that 
I had given in my very first mail. For your convenience..here it is 
again (from http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/1/7/135)

<quote>
..in order to ensure that ext3 can safely resume an unlink after a
crash, it actually zeros out the block pointers in the inode, whereas
ext2 just marks these blocks as unused in the block bitmaps and marks
the inode as "deleted" and leaves the block pointers alone.
Your only hope is to "grep" for parts of your files that have been 
deleted and hope for the best...
</quote>

As he clearly explains, ext2 will maintain pointers to deleted blocks 
while ext3 will not. That means, we know where the deleted blocks are 
and there's a way we can differentiate them from the unused blocks that 
never had any data before. fat32 has a similar way. So there is a 
logical possibility to undelete. As ext3 doesn't maintain such pointers 
to deleted blocks, there's no reliable way we can know where the deleted 
blocks are. I hope you see the difference now.

Another thing..if your ext3 partition is fragmented then you won't be 
able to retrieve your file completely by reading the partition 
contiguously. One part of your file may be in one place and another 
somewhere else.

Well guys, what I meant was that if the cables are
properly inserted and jumpers properly set, then first
you have to ensure that the BIOS sees the disk. 

Remember that it is the BIOS that assigns most of the
IRQs and detects the hard disk, its capacity etc...

In your case of network card not getting found, what
do you mean by "Not found"? 

Of course, debian will find the network card
everytime, it may not be able to use it either due to
IRQ clash(not likely), or NIC problem or memory not
getting mapped. 

If you try googling for the output of dmesg|grep -i
net

then you may get some hints.

As to the interaction between BIOS and linux drivers,
well once linux loads, it doesn't use the BIOS. But
there are exceptions. Every OS uses the BIOS for
certain purposes though no OS relies on it like DOS.

BIOS is very critical and the dependency on BIOS even
after the OS is running is unlikely to get removed.

This is true with all modern OSes, *BSD, linux and
Windoze...

In principle, yes; BIOS drivers have nothing to do
with linux drivers.

Looks like we were barking up the wrong tree then.
This is a very simple problem easily fixed. Your MBR
has got corrupted. Get a Debian rescue floppy or CDROM
or even a Windoze floppy or whatever and install an
MBR.

It is in Windoze
C:> fdisk /mbr

Under linux you have to use lilo or grub. Though the
particular command I don't recollect. 

Is that a new disk? Or old one? Did you install
something else already? Since in a new disk the odds
of such a thing happening are one in a million.

well u guys r not gonna like this. linux kernel is
buggy. its network drivers don't support many cards.
even FreeBSD has this issue. I found this working
perfectly only under OpenBSD and NetBSD.

In your case, of course both distros used same linux
OS but the built in driver support for cards must have
been different. 

Anyway since you solved the issue it is no use
discussing it. :-)

Let's get to the basics. 

Linux kernel development is separate from driver
development. Network drivers are usually provided by
vendors, even though they are part of the
kernel-space.

Linux is a kernel, not an operating system.

in this context, I used this tool
testdisk(http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk)  to recover
partitions from accidental mkfs on it. testdisk is supposed to be used
for for finding files too. you could actually do your recovery

some intelligent scripting with linux disk editor(lde) could be useful too.

Drivers form the most critical part of an operating
system no matter whether in kernel or user space. And
most of the ethernet card drivers are written by Alan
Cox(or someone like that :-) and are open source, only
for few cards binary blobs exist.

Whereas OpenBSD has taken the approach of never
putting a binary blob and always making their code,
documentation , everything completely open. Remember,
OpenBSD's licensing is one of the most open and
business friendly. They don't distribute their ISOs
but other than that, you cannot point out any selfish
interest there.

In fact I feel OpenBSD is the best operating system
when it comes to cleanliness of design and lack of
politics. It is amazing how much a lone warrior called
Theo de Raadt has achieved with just a bunch of
hackers.

In fact if I get commit access to OpenBSD code base I
will consider myself blessed.

The kernel I know the most is the OpenBSD kernel and I
simply love its coding style, elegance and simplicity.

NetBSD seems to be the grand daddy of driver design
and architecture. They even have portable drivers with
each layer clearly separated. I have not yet seen
NetBSD kernel code, so I can't comment here.

Coming back to linux, which is a kernel as u rightly
mentioned, there is not much cohesion between the
various kernel components possibly owing to the huge
number of ppl working on it and Linus's lust for
control. 

If linux had a set of several committers to take in
changes like FreeBSD, things could have been better. 

Hence many folks who submit patches to the linux
kernel are disappointed since their patch may take
months to get noticed.

Whereas with the BSDs , a patch is accepted or
rejected immediately.

Moreover linux kernel has several design deficiences
to begin with. 

Ok now, I don't want to get alienated from the group
for speaking the truth. :-)

Some ppl attach a certain childish religious fervour
to these things and get offended for silly reasons.

When we get too attached , we become resistant and
defensive when someone points out faults.

Truth suffers in the process. For most of us truth is
what we want to believe. :-)

You can argue that just bcoz I say something it is not
truth and brush it aside that it is just my "opinion"
but then I welcome you to form an opinion for
yourselves.

I am just presenting my observations here.

Girish

Going back to a product line that didnt work out well is not patriotism

Rahul

Well I don't understand what is being implied by "Going back to a product line that didnt work out well is not patriotism" ? Do you mean Redhat 8.0 & 9.0 didn't rock - well I was under the impression that these two were the prime reasons why Redhat gained media glare in the first place. Correct me if I'm wrong. Secondly, "Going back" ? So you do accept that redhat didn't give the necessary attention to FC ? And the very idea of splitting FC from the redhat EL shows that. 

Redhat shot itself in its foot by not capitalizing on the desktop version of RH. They could have with some effort made it a worthy competitor to windows (in terms of usability to the average user). As for the concept of patriotism, I guess thats what they are trying to do now... Now that Ubuntu has become the popular desktop distro and people (sys admins & biz decision makers) are starting to consider Ubuntu for corporate use as well.  http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/editorial_13

However it is amazing to see such support for RH in this forum. I won't loose hope - maybe with the sheer support of guys like you FC might become a quality desktop distro. Hoping for the best.

Hassan

Apropos of session management I got a few new
thoughts. 

For me at least what I care the most when I have a
power outage is losing the open windows in firefox.

It is lamentable that despite being recent, firefox
hasn't learnt from Opera that session management
should be enabled be default. Even galeon has it. 

Anyway with the tabmix plugin everything works like a
charm, even the page offsets are preserved.

Now, if I have ten xterms or wterms or whatever, in
each of them I will have a different state. I will be
reading a man page, "less somethign.txt" , or vim
file1, file2 , file3.

How to save and restore these things? This presents an
interesting problem. I guess you have to go into the
application level and make changes. 

In this context it may not be inappropriate to talk of
journaling file systems. How they support saving and
restoring state also may be explored though I wonder
if it directly relevent to what we are talking.

Girish

You need to provide more information:

Which distro did you try?
There are some issues with SATA drives with old distros, but the
latest ones must support them. And some BIOSes provide a way to
disable SATA and make them look like PATA(IDE). If you have such a
BIOS, enable PATA emulation and retry the installation. If you are
successful in installing the system like this, you may later try and
enable SATA. Sometimes the kernels used in the installers are older
than the ones in the distros that they install.

Dropping a product or creating new products has absolutely nothing to do 
with patriotism in any organization. So lets cut the drama and 
concentrate on the facts.


  Do you mean
> Redhat 8.0 & 9.0 didn't rock - well I was under the impression that

> first place. 

The product line was absolutely good. It just didnt work well as a 
business. Good products are not always good business. There are multiple 
reasons for that in the case of Red Hat Linux. One of them is that the 
retail world simply doesnt not respond well to releases every six 
months. End users would see Red Hat Linux 6.0 boxes on the shelfs long 
after RedHat Linux 8 was released, buy it out for say 40 dollars and 
call up Red Hat for support. Since the customer brought the product 
thats natural however that particular version had a lifecyle of usually 
an year and would have long since been EOL'ed leaving everyone frustrated.

There is also the fact that selling Free software on CD's works only 
when users dont have access to broad band connections which was 
increasingly not the case world over. (FSF made relatively good business 
long back selling emacs on CD's for example).

Fedora is again on a six month release cycle and a year or more worth of 
updates for every release however it side steps the "retail model" 
problem for Red Hat since Red Hat just let local vendors directly 
download redistribute it. It also lets contributors external to Red Hat 
participate and drive  the development of a distribution in various ways 
beyond just reporting bugs.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux isnt a retail product either. It is a 
subscription. You register, pay and download or get it from local vendors.


Correct me if I'm wrong. Secondly, "Going back" ?

I meant going back to a retail model. Like I said both Fedora Core and 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux are not off the shelf products and it doesnt 
depend on retail vendors to play catch up to latest versions available 
solving that problem in different ways for both the consumer and the 
vendor.


  So you do
> accept that redhat didn't give the necessary attention to FC ? And the 
> very idea of splitting FC from the redhat EL shows that.

Fedora Core has a very similar set of engineers within Red Hat to 
product it as much as Red Hat Linux did. It is just developed in a more 
open fashion with community contributors. Like I said bandwidth alone 
for the project costs Red Hat a couple of million dollars every year and 
more resources are being spend every day. So I cant see where there is a 
lack of "attention".

As for the reasons for the split and various other details, see the 
general overview by me at http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Presentations

A few mails back you were arguing that trying to work on the desktop 
market is eating other people's pie, there was money to be made on the 
desktop and vendors should focus just on the servers.  Anyway there is 
both client and server side products from Red Hat. Things will get 
better one step at a time.


As

Again there is no question of patriotism anywhere in this discussion.

I have several systems where the bios is too old to recognize the larger capacity hard-disks now available (pentium III systems) and the hdd's being ~40 to 80GB IDEs.  Linux has no problems detecting these disks once they are labeled as 'none' in bios - i.e. disable bios checks on these disks.  Of course to boot you need a disk which is recognized by the bios (or is there a work around for this?) and so I use older smaller disks for this on the primary partition.  

Regards the original poster's problem regarding sata detection - maybe he could check if the disk is recognized with a live-cd...

I didnt say it has nothing to do with the organization. Sure it impacts 
people but its not a question of patriotism in anyway that I can see.

When did I say anything about markets? I was talking about the problems 
in releasing a retail product every six months and how RHEL by means of 
a subscription model avoids that problem.

Fedora is Free in both sense. Investment in Fedora doesnt directly yield 
any revenue since it is not a commercial product. RHEL is of course a 
completely different question.

hey, If you want to read and believe everything that is written on the

Guys,

This is way OT which is y i put two [OT]. :-) lol!

I am interested in a world map which clearly shows the
countries and states and important cities. 

Looks like my geography knowledge is bit rusty since I
was not sure if Bahrain was in UAE or not. 

IOW I am looking for a clear political world map. 

Thanks. If it is a pdf or website, anything is fine. 

At the same time I don't want something as bulky as
google earth. :-)

All I want is a clean representation of important
place s on the globe, which country and continent they
belong to, that is all.

regards,
Girish

What amazes me more is the antagonism towards Redhat in this forum.
I'd have thought there'd be more acceptance of a company that proved
that Free Software can be built into a successful business model
without compromising on the basic freedoms.

havent been following this thread, but redhat bashing is a popular  
sport in FOSS circles. For some reason people think the company is  
'not quite' FOSS. Shows they dont understand what FOSS is. (I bash  
redhat because of the borked utf-8 in rh9)

Message-ID: <20060822090303.32269.qmail@web35608.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Friends,

I found it very hard indeed to render the e-ticket
booked thro' irctc properly so I could print it. 

Apparently irctc gives you a javascript page with the
ticket. Since I don't have a printer, I want to save
that page and upload it , go to a browsing center and
print it. 

But the issue here is that the javascript generated is
buggy and it doesnt do postscript conversion correctly
as a result. 

At last I gave up and renamed the printTicket.js file
to printTicket.html, adjusted the two train and irctc
logo file gifs to point to a relative path and I was
done. I printed directly from html.

Am wondering what do you guys do? Is there a way we
can inform the railways about this issue? Wouldn't it
be much better if it spat out a pdf that cannot be
edited instead of js or html?

Anyone has any contact with the railways to get this
done? 

Thanks.

regards,
Girish

i guess redhat is not FOSS. FOSS includes redhat. and redhat lives
because of FOSS

How about:

less /var/log/squid/access.log

(or wherever your squid puts its cache access logs in)

        Hi,
 
 I am trying to create a small webservice using Perl. 
 
 I have 2 files : temp.pl and temper.cgi ( as specified in http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/01/soap.html).  When i try calling ,  "$ perl temp.pl" , i am getting the following an error after a gap of around 3-4 minutes: 500 Can't connect to abc:80 (connect: timeout) at temp.pl line 6
 
 Has anyone any previous experience with creating Web-Services using Perl?

abc shud be substituted with the name of the SOAP
server to connect to. i.e., 

print SOAP::Lite>      ->
 uri('http://abc/cgi-bin/pqr/venky_temp/Temperatures')
      ->
 proxy('http://abc/cgi-bin/pqr/venky_temp/temper.cgi')
      -> c2f(37.5)
      -> result;

should read

print SOAP::Lite>      ->

uri('http://www.perl.com/cgi-bin/pqr/venky_temp/Temperatures')
      ->
 proxy('http://abc/cgi-bin/pqr/venky_temp/temper.cgi')
      -> c2f(37.5)
      -> result;  

Of course if you have a proxy you should change that
as well or just leave it out.

HTH,
Girish
PS:- In this case I have used www.perl.com, you should
use your SOAP server.

Just a small python script which retrives the URLs from the access.log file:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import re
import sys

file = sys.argv[1]
myfile = open(file, 'r')

p = re.compile(r'.*\"(.*)\".*',re.S)

for linestr in myfile.readlines():
    m = p.match(linestr)
    if m == None:
        pass
    else:
        print m.group(1)

    linestr = myfile.readline()

myfile.close()
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above will filter only the URLs from access.log and prints. Pass
access.log file's localtion as command line argument to this script :)

Sorry I can't help you here as I have no prior exp.
There are folks out there who are better than me. Hope
they will help you out.

AFAIK SOAP is XML tunneled over HTTP. And I don't
think there is a client server architecture here, so I
think what I meant by SOAP server is actually "SOAP
peer" or something.

Already I am talking thro' the hat, so let me stop
right here. :-)

My advice to you would be to learn the SOAP protocol
by browsing. There are lot of excellent resources on
the web. You can go thro' the official specs at w3c I
think.

I have taken months to get certain things working. For
instance I spent one month to get my TV card working
perfectly under linux. I don't care bcoz I care only
about learning.

The more you learn on your own, the more confident you
become, the younger you get and above all the more fun
you have!

Sometimes I feel that if something works first time I
don't learn much. 

In fact if you take the time to solve the problem on
your own, the advantage is that you can become
efficient at what you are doing and proceed much
faster later. So taking time now is actually an
investment, not a waste of time. The best investment
that you can make is not money but your brain and hard
work. :-)

However if you are in a hurry google is your best
friend and relevant documentation of course.

Sorry again that I am not able to help you any
further.

regards,
Girish

Nice job Senthil. Just a quick question.

Isn't the line "linestr = myfile.readline()"
redundant?

Or am I missing something?

Yes I agree with this. Since most of us use 2.3 and above we can

well, this is the reverse of the problem reported earlier wherein the
packages were new version but the packages.gz file listed the older
versions. i believe the problem is upstream of us and this is now reported
in the debian-mirrors mailing list. you have indicated that the packages
ARE present in http.us.debian.org. actually, they are not. well, maybe.
http.us.debian.org (or ftp.us.debian.org) resolves into several addresses
and one of the addresses has a broken mirror (its the 204.x address that
is broken). this means that anyone mirroring from ftp.us.debian.org (this
means mamy mirrors including ours) has a finite chance of hitting this bad
server and ending up with a broken mirror.

yes, updates run nightly, so things may get fixed overnight. however, this 
does not mean the problem is solved. since ftp.us.debian.org points to 
multiple addresses and one of these is a broken server, it may just 
be that yesterday we updated from the broken server while today we shifted 
to a good server. till the upstream broken server is fixed, this problem 
will continue to periodically show up.

(10.65.0.2 is the on campus address of ftp.iitm.ac.in) the time stamps are
not ours. we replicate the time stamp on the upstream mirror. if everyone
follows this, the time stamp on each individual file will be the same
irrespective of where and when it was mirrored. debian uses the
project/trace directory to store actual repository update time stamps.
this directory will (should) contain files that indicate the mirror path
from ftp-master.debian.org. so, all mirrors should have a file
ftp-master.debian.org. sites that directly mirror from the master site
will have only this file - this would be most of the primary mirror sites.  
we are a secondary (leaf) mirror site - so, our repository will have
additional files and time stamps in this directory corresponding to the
intermediate site(s)  from which we actually mirror. i am also using the 
other common method of putting a last-updated-on file indicating the last 
update (local) time on our mirrored content.

Whoa!! that was helluva gyaan :) . Anywayz, i did lookout at almost all the available resources like w3c , CPAN Perl  and SOAP::Lite docs. My code looks abs fine, but teh setup seems to be messed up w.r.t the libs etc - need to check on this. Once i find the solution, I shall update his thread so that others can benefit.

Thanks for the help B-)

The easiest way is to invoke your perl web services as cgi-scripts from
apache.  Put your perl scripts in the cgi-bin directory and use the Perl
CGI wrapper for SOAP.  The soap-lite modules have the necessary
documentation.

Configuration? Does it mean configuration immediately after the installation?
I have installed NS-2 on RH9 & Fedora 1 but never on FC5.

Suresh,

I am able to appreciate it at a high level that udev can and should perform
the job of hotplug since after udev is a dynamic file system that uses sysfs
for detecting hotplugging of devices.

However several details are missing and I hope to learn that in due course.

It looks as though programs like grepmap and pnp_modules from userspace are
used in place of hotplug.

Anyway what I learnt from this is that you are well ahead of everyone else,
at least google! :-)

Nice to see that! Hope many more luggers stay ahead of the time like you
instead of getting stuck with dry academic theory and what books say...

Maybe you could tell us a little bit about how you are able to gain real
life experience. Something that can help the students in this list.

Thanks.

tell you something - i googled for all that. and i got it.

my field is spam filtering (and that too at a policy level)

re linux - i've used it for several years, but i'm at the most at a
"clued user" level.

i can't program even a hello world program in perl, c, soap or whatever

i can't tell the difference between a resistor and a capacitor (though i
did a bsc in electronics 10 yrs back)

I dont need to have an automotive engg degree to drive a car .. (with my
"soda buddi" glasses i cant drive either)

but I do know to use google.

And what google doesnt supply, something as easy as "find

 I think fundamentally the improvement area for luggies and we Indians in
general seems to be that we should close our text books and go out there ,
get our hands dirty and implement things. Learn from real life experience
instead of talking high sounding theory like professors...

I myself have this defect and I am constantly fighting day and night to get
over this.  A little bit of practical experience can save us a great deal of
argument , heartburns and ego clashes.

How many meetings I have seen in the top corporates of India, MNCs as ppl
call in which people fight over silly issues just bcoz people are talking at
an intellectual level instead of going out and doing things themselves?

Once you do it and experience it, you don't need anybody else's support. Not
even that of encyclopaedia Britannica or wikipedia....

Girish

Just a small python script which retrives the URLs from the access.log file:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import re
import sys

file = sys.argv[1]
myfile = open(file, 'r')

p = re.compile(r'.*\"(.*)\".*',re.S)

for linestr in myfile.readlines():
    m = p.match(linestr)
    if m == None:
        pass
    else:
        print m.group(1)

    linestr = myfile.readline()

myfile.close()
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above will filter only the URLs from access.log and prints. Pass
access.log file's localtion as command line argument to this script :)

Find where is your access.log file generated by squid. In debian I
think it will be in /var/log/squid/

Am not sure about your distro where squid will generate the log. If
you have compiled squid from source and using it am sure you have
edited the squid.conf file. If it is so then just see where have you
specified the localtion for access.log.

Once you got the location of access.log say for example
/var/log/squid/access.log
Then in your terminal run the following:

$ python geturl.py /var/log/squid/access.log

The above command works fine, but I would suggest you to use the following:

$ python geturl.py /var/log/squid/access.log | less

since the access.log file will be fairly huge and if you need to see
the URLs clearly.

I assume that you have copied the above script in a file called
geturl.py. If you dont understand my above explanation please feel
free to ask the question again, am ready to explain it more
elaborately.

Graylisting is well .. kind of effective. But it has some interesting side
effects (that translate to massively delayed email) when it comes up against
another popular spam filtering method called "callbacks" where the receiving
mailserver connects back to the mailserver for the sending address, tries to
send a test mail to verify if the addess exists, before accepting mail.

[that callback thing is one of the defaults on cpanel and i think also plesk -
popular webhosting control panels .. and also used by some large isps like
verizon]

But aside from that, both graylists and "banner delays" are remarkably useful,
and "cheap" methods to cut down spam.

DSPAM, like Spamassassin, is a fairly cpu / disk etc heavy software that
assigns weighted scores to various spam characteristics. Normally - for regular
mailservers where you usually have far more capacity on the server, than you
have users, it should work just fine (you just have to keep tuning it to your
needs, and regularly updating it - its not a hero honda style "fill it, shut
it, forget it" thing). 

For busy mailservers / very large installations you need to do something
different - concentrate on cheaper to implement solutions (well chosen smtp
blocklists, helo checks, banner delays etc)

Long story, that .. and it is not possible to give you a specific answer
without knowing a lot more details - and without your asking specific questions
(more specific than "how effective is technique X and software Y")

Thanks a lot for the quote.I am trying to implement a spam filter
mechanism on a mailserver with abt 300 users and with lots of traffic.
I have tested the dspam stuff in the basic but not statisfied with the
performance(surely due to lack of tuning).

Thanks & Regards

300 is nothing .. when you get to several hundred / a few thousand on a
server, or maybe several million .. then.

Try spamassassin - rather more actively maintained.

Message-ID: <ed2d3c000608231202x21385f34i1c3699839d96ebd4@mail.gmail.com>

This is just a reminder to kick your Software Freedom Day preparations
up a notch - and to make sure that we here at SFD Central hear about it
so that we can give away glittering prizes!

For individual competitors we've got a bunch of SFD T-shirts with
Officially Cool Peoples' signatures on it, including everyone's
favourite millionaire cosmonaut Linux enthusiast, Mark Shuttleworth.
Just imagine what those shirts will be worth on ebay....  And if that's
not enough for you we've also lined up some seriously powerful hardware
from IBM: five POWER5 servers for team entries to the competition.

You can get your hands on a T-shirt by snapping a cool photo of your SFD
event, or perhaps sending us a photo of a Very Important Person enjoying
your SFD event.  For the IBM servers you need to do a little more work,
like
 * get your local/national newspaper to publish an article about your
 event
 * get yourself interviewed on radio or TV
 * write in your blog or podcast about SFD
 * make some interesting "urban art" about software freedom
 * put some leaflets through people's postboxes
 * get some posters up on the lampposts around town

The full competition details and rules (including the categories for
entries) are at http://softwarefreedomday.org/Competition2006.
Competition entries need to be emailed to board@sf-day.org.

Robert.

PS - 24 days left to go.....

I need time to prepare as some of the topics are really deep.

Only if I understand it spending few days I will be able to
talk for few minutes!

I shall let you know the venue and other details once I am
ready!

Dear boys and girls,

I am ready for a cool FreeBSD install demo ; so let us
have some innocent fun for about three hours.

All I need from you is a room with a computer preferrably with Internet
connection but it is not a must.

I am ready this very minute, so please hurry and let us meet up! :-)

You can find the slides here.

http://girish1729.googlepages.com/A-date-with-FreeBSD.pdf

I have made the slides delibrately non technical and
highly informal.

Great guys like Suresh and Raja Superman who have experience with *BSD are
specially invited since you can share your experiences here.

Koushik Narayanan, where are you? You have written some cool program for
FreeBSD pkg management, right? Can u also come?

Of course, more the merrier, But I am more than willing to meet even if it
is only 10 or 15 students.

I want this to be like a party instead of streamlined talks like GLV or LDD
...

If any of you have a house big enuf to accomodate folks, that will be still
better. No mic necessary, nothing required, only a computer.

I will get you involved so you can get acquainted with FreeBSD in the most
practical and easy manner possible.

My house is ok but I don't have a spare computer and my main computer has
got hosed!

Please let us meet up sometime really soon! What about the coming weekend,
26 or 27? Will that suit you?

regards,
Girish

Kindly let the group know well in advance so that people can plan their schedules accordingly - this will highly benefit people who are not in chennai and do not mind coming down to chennai for this :)

Already I am trying to do something very ambitious by trying to give you
everything related to networking and I am finding it lil bit taxing right
now. But I am sure things will be alright in a couple of weeks.

Raja,

Will you be able to help me out with certain networking topics? It is always
better to have different perspectives for the audience. If I were to do
everything, then there will be a certain inevitable bias . It will be far
more convincing to have a third person give their views.

Please don't feel that I am singling out individuals. All of you are welcome
to join me and share my load.

Suresh,

My antenna is able to pick up certain frequencies like grey listing, helo
checks, blocklists, banner delays and callbacks.

If you could spend five minutes giving me an intuitive simple explanation of
these five concepts, it will help me make up for your absence.

I think after all what the audience wants is an introduction and one does
not need to be an expert for that.

Maybe after this talk we can have another session
that covers the advanced topics.

What say guys?

I always like to begin at the beginning. :-)

regards,
Girish

Yes, yes. I will let the group know well in advance. By well in advance, I
mean at least three weeks time.

And this need not be restricted to lug members. Any Tom, Dick and Harry is
welcome. Morever since this is going to be absolutely free, I will not be
able to arrange for snacks or DVDs or tea, coffee or food.

One way to tackle this is by asking some company with deep pockets to
sponsor this. In all likelihood this will not happen.

A practical way of solving this problem is making sure that such things are
available in the vicinity. :-) You pay money and have, that is all.

And again, unless someone is willing to spare their video camera, and get
someone to video tape it, I can't do anything.

Ok now, back to reading OSPF!

Girish

Hi
 
 I followed your steps still i didn't get solution.
 
 The log file is under "/var/log/squid/access.log"
 
if i use "less /var/log/squid/access.log" its showing all the log details.
 
 I have saved the script under "geturl.py" filename.
 
 If i ran "python geturl.py /var/log/squid/access.log | less" it says :
 
 Complete blank page and in end of the page "lines ?-?/? (END)"
 
 Script which i have used :
 
 import re
 import sys
 
 file = sys.argv[1]
 myfile = open(file, 'r')
 
 p = re.compile(r'.*\"(.*)\".*',re.S)
 
 for linestr in myfile.readlines():
     m = p.match(linestr)
     if m == None:
         pass
     else:
         print m.group(1)
 
     linestr = myfile.readline()
 
 myfile.close()
 
 Tell me what to do in this regard

Find where is your access.log file generated by squid. In debian I
think it will be in /var/log/squid/

Am not sure about your distro where squid will generate the log. If
you have compiled squid from source and using it am sure you have
edited the squid.conf file. If it is so then just see where have you
specified the localtion for access.log.

Once you got the location of access.log say for example
/var/log/squid/access.log
Then in your terminal run the following:

$ python geturl.py /var/log/squid/access.log

The above command works fine, but I would suggest you to use the following:

$ python geturl.py /var/log/squid/access.log | less

since the access.log file will be fairly huge and if you need to see
the URLs clearly.

I assume that you have copied the above script in a file called
geturl.py. If you dont understand my above explanation please feel
free to ask the question again, am ready to explain it more
elaborately.

Yeah I understand your problem. This needs some more insight about
your squid.conf. Just open your squid.conf file and see whether there
is a line called

"emulate_httpd_log on"

If the above is present then your log format will be "common log file
format" in squid terms which will look like this

remotehost rfc931 authuser [date] "method URL" status bytes

For the above format my script works.

If you have not enabled emulate_httpd_log then your log file format is
called "native log file format" which is the default for squid.conf
and it looks like this

For squid 1.0:
time elapsed remotehost code/status/peerstatus bytes method URL

For squid 1.1:
time elapsed remotehost code/status bytes method URL rfc931
peerstatus/peerhost type

And for squid 2.0 there is a small difference in the content.

So when it is this case my script fails. Another easy way to achive
the same thing which my script does is by use of a command :

$ tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log | awk '{print $7}'

The above command is generic enough and works fine for both common and
native file formats. So I would prefer if you use the above command
then you will get what you expect.. Just kick it off and let me know..
Still if you are unable to get the output am ready to help you.

PS: Since I used common log file format based access.log so my python
script failed to perform for native log file format.

Sunday is Vinayaka Chaturthi day and may not suit everyone.
Moreover i am engaged on Sun evening.

Unless the venue with just one computer with an Internet connection

Any takers?

Well, this topic was to come up sooner or later. So it is good that I
clarify about this right away.

Understand that I stand to gain by this. I am going to have fun, learn since
teaching is the best way to learn and I will also gain your gratitude and
hopefully some contacts. Moreover I will gain invaluable experience in
training.

If I charge 10 or 20, the question will come, why not 1000,  why not 10,000.

It will be like weighing my 10 years of experience and hard work with
money. No amount of money can ever make up for that.

Another way to look at it is, if everyone were money minded, today
there would be no linux or *BSD and we would not be talking. :-)

Most importantly I owe my entire life to open source and people's
willingnes to share knowledge freely. I look upon this as my own
little way to pay back to the community.

I hope I make myself clear. Please don't get vexed thinking that I am
doing some social service like Narmada Bachao Andolan .

I don't understand what people mean by charity. The best way to keep
yourself happy is to help others. Why make a big deal of it?

I am in it with a strict personal purpose!

I am not burning my pockets here. Unless one of you or some of you
come forward and arrange the following things, the talk will not
happen. Period.

a) A hall large enough to accommodate the attendees (preferrably IIT
auditorium since it is cheap and good)
b) A video camera and a cameraman
c) A sound system that is really good. The acoustics of the room
should be such that it supports a large number of people hearing
clearly what the speaker is saying.
d) A projector that can maker sure that people sitting in the last row
can clearly read the text
e) Other logistics that I don't remember

This is not an individual effort. This is a team effort driven by me,
that is all.

As they say,

"It is amazing how much we can accomplish if we don't care who gets the credit."

regards,
Girish

PS:- I would much appreciate if this thread stopped right here.
Already I had heated discussions on this with my father and
grandfather. I can't take anymore. Nobody can convince me to charge
money for this.

Message-ID: <5ef2113c0608240016w1ef450co71565f01b9aa9cfe@mail.gmail.com>

I want to know how can we make a port be occupied in GNU/Linux.

For example I want to make something listen on port 80, 3306, etc
ports by not actually running a webserver, mysql, etc respectively.

So that if an application which wants to use the port say if I need to
install apache then while doing so it will tel me that the port is
already used by some other application. Is this possible?

Simply stated, "I want to occupy a port without running the actual server."

Brilliant idea! Let me elaborate . What you want cannot be achieved on some
systems bcoz if the app uses the setsockopt SO_REUSEPORT, then it
won't recv the error. However for the majority of apps, you can make do with
just this on the command line.

$ nc -l 3306
or
$nc -l -p 3306

I am typing from my OpenBSD machine. So the second one might be
relevant for u. Also bear in mind that sometimes, it listens at
127.0.0.1 instead of ur NAT or global IP. So u need to explore that as
well.

Kernel has many threads running, each thread has its own stack, and of
course there are interrupt handlers and bottom halves. So kernel as
such has
several contexts and each context requires a stack
though the kernel runs as one single process...

Usually the virtual mem is divided into 1 GB - 3 GB or 2 GB - 2 GB
halves, one occupied by kernel
and one by user processes.

Remember this is virtual and not real mem. Even RAM + swap space is
hardly 3 GB. This is just a
ballpark figure ,that is all.

top output gives you certain idea about user space processes. But
since the system is so dynamic with processes being born and dying
constantly, even top finds it somewhat hard to give u this info.

Maybe Shakthi can tell u how to figure out kernel mem.

I told u about top. You could also use the proc filesystem. man proc.

I think you might get some hints looking at /proc/sys/kernel or
something. I don't have access to linux now.

sysctl -a also is your friend. man sysctl.

Netcat will quit after one connection (I haven't seen any option in
the Linux default one to behave as a forking server), so a better
option might be to use xinetd/discard service on the ports you want to
disable.

Message-ID: <7938ae610608240127v3302eb00p8ca7a22a04a34d7c@mail.gmail.com>

Guys,

I often find that ignorance hurts! Ouch!

Right now the heat is on me since I belong to a certain yahoogroups!
and many ppl use Windoze there.And sometimes viruses goes on rounds.

Last time, someone came up with a retrograde idea of blocking all
forwards after the virus storm blew over. :-)

I suggested that it was stupid to do that and protested vehemently
that viruses don't come everyday. Once the attack is over, it takes a
long time to come back.

And then, nobody listened and everyone sufferred since nobody could
send attachments.

At last after persistent efforts from my side the floodgates were opened.

But now the issue has come up again. We Indians are spectacularly
talented in doing something in the most inefficient manner. For
instance, our IT industry does with 10 ppl what one guy would do in
US.

And there is another interesting anecdote of an airport closing its
gates for aircrafts since they didnt have personnel to man them.
Instead of getting additional personnel, they closed the gates causing
inconvenience to everyone.

So instead of blocking attachments, is there a way by which I can ask
ppl to do something bold and meaningful ?

Moving the mailing list away from yahoogroups! is not an immediate
solution. Anything else?

Remember it is a restricted mailing list , only members can post etc..
So it should be easy.

Thanks,
Girish

man dd

for ex,

dd if=/dev/hda1 of=firstharddisk bs=1024

dd if=/dev/hda3 of=homefilesystem bs=1024

This is a raw copy that bypasses the file system. This is
sometimes called disk "ghosting".

There is a very good chance this is not what you are looking for. In
which case you should be more specific.

IOW, accurate answer for the question, but possibly irrelevant for u.

I got that you are using native log file format.

Again this is simple. Use the following command

$ tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log | awk '{print $3 "\t" $7}'

HTH :)

This might be of your interest, a simple backup manager.

http://www.backup-manager.org/

To get it, you can do "apt-get install backup-manager', provided you 
have apt installed and have an internet connection :D

Yes of course it could be done. I ll let you explain in detail so that
you can do it..
You have native log file format in a squid which is >= squid 2.0, so
your log format will be like the following:

time elapsed remotehost code/status bytes method URL rfc931
peerstatus/peerhost type

If you are using the follwing command:

$ tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log | awk '{print $3 "\t" $7}'

in the above you ask to print the 3rd and the 7th parameter as in the
native log file format. So if you see the third and seventh are remote
host ip and URL respectively as in the naitve log file format. So if
you want to print the time (which includes date too I suppose) then do
the following:

$ tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log | awk '{print $1 "\t" $3 "\t" $7}'

I think that explains how it works :)

>  And, is there any posibility to block the url by using squid proxy ?

Yes this is very well possible. You should install squidGuard to do
the above. Its again simple to install in that you have different
files in a db folder in which you can specify what are the URLs you
want to block.. As simple as that...

I use http://www.nongnu.org/rdiff-backup/.  It provides incremental, snapshot
backups that are space and bandwidth efficient.  You can run your backups
on remote machines, or local/removeable disk.

I have ~3 TB sitting on this stuff, and highly recommend it to anyone who's
looking for a disk based backup solution.

Guys,

A very small problem here albeit easily solvable. There is no Internet
in that place. If any of you have a reliance mobile and a cable that
plugs into the USB or ethernet interface of the PC, I guess we are
done.

The demo will go thro' perfectly even without it but I
much prefer it since we can have much more fun.

Any volunteers please?

Looking fwd to meeting u all day after tomorrow!

regards,
Girish

Good news. Raja has agreed to bring his laptop with Reliance CDMA. I
guess we can use his machine as gateway and communicate with the
Internet.

Hi,

You can do that in the GUI itself.

Go into Applications > System Settings > Security Level

In that, you will have two tabs firewall and SELinux.

Enable the Firewall and whatever configuration you want.

Guys,

Raja has consented to show you guys OpenBSD installation as well as
working with pf - the number one packet filter, firewall, TCP/IP swiss army
knife in the world!

I myself had been wanting to learn pf for a very long time. Thanks a
ton to Raja. :-)

So please don't miss this opportunity!

This will surely help you groom yourself for the upcoming ilugc talk.

pf is pure voodoo! :-)

For simple installations, I find it easy to take a gzipped tar image of the
root directory.
Ofcourse, after booting with a live cd.

look at /proc interface.

cat /proc/iomem | grep -i 'kernel data'. You would get the address range.

Do u mean virtual memory? if yes just check this code


main()
{
   char *ch = getenv("HOME");
   if((unsigned long)ch > (unsigned long)(0x7FFFFFFF))
      printf("3/1 GB split\n");
   else
      printf("2/2 GB split\n");

}



you can enable memory_accounting option in kernel configuration. User space
memory can be calculated using sum of (pmap <each pid from /proc> | grep -i
'total'). U can write a small script to calculate the total user space. But
remind it will not give you the actual size.

If u want to write a kernel module , then u can do like...by manipulating
(task_struct,mm_struct,vm_area_struct). You could pass the PID from /proc
interface
as a parameter and manipulate the total size.



3) How to find the avialable kernel / user space and used kernel / user
> space? is there any shell command to see that?



cat /proc/meminfo


I am also learning kernel programming.  if i do mistake please correct me.

Any idea? Please lets share.

Unfortunately I am not able to try out your stuff since I don't have
access to linux this moment.

However I am very very happy to see more kernel hackers.

I think it is somewhat odd to start with the kernel before
understanding rest of UNIX design and philosophy but one has to get
acquainted with the kernel design and code for sure.

I urge more and more folks to try kernel hacking so you could help me
when I am in trouble! :-)

Yes of course it could be done. I ll let you explain in detail so that
you can do it..
You have native log file format in a squid which is >= squid 2.0, so
your log format will be like the following:

time elapsed remotehost code/status bytes method URL rfc931
peerstatus/peerhost type

If you are using the follwing command:

$ tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log | awk '{print $3 "\t" $7}'

in the above you ask to print the 3rd and the 7th parameter as in the
native log file format. So if you see the third and seventh are remote
host ip and URL respectively as in the naitve log file format. So if
you want to print the time (which includes date too I suppose) then do
the following:

$ tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log | awk '{print $1 "\t" $3 "\t" $7}'

I think that explains how it works :)

>  And, is there any posibility to block the url by using squid proxy ?

Yes this is very well possible. You should install squidGuard to do
the above. Its again simple to install in that you have different
files in a db folder in which you can specify what are the URLs you
want to block.. As simple as that...

The simple solution to this I can think as of now is, can you enable
the coomon log file format in your squid.conf? If so most of the
issues becomes simple. Since I dont have a log with native file
format, I cant check the above.

Try these:

  ps
  pstree

Check their man pages for specific options that you
might need.

Kannan,

The only lasting solution to your problems will be spending a month
or two reading up some man pages and if necessary good books
on UNIX. Browse the Internet. There are plenty of information on
linux, especially the LDP project.

http://en.tldp.org

Specifically the man pages that are of immediate relevance to u r

a) awk(1) ( it could be gawk,nawk or mawk :-)
b) strftime(3)
c) gettimeofday(3)
d) printf(1)
e) syslog(8)
f ) date(1)

Of course you should spend a lot of time browsing the online documentation
available in http://www.squid-cache.org/

Senthil is trying his level best to help you. If I were in his place I would
have lost patience long ago. Kudos to Senthil!

Please don't get me wrong. Nobody can help you beyond a point.

You have to help yourself.

I sincerely apologize if this hurts you but I really see no way out.

regards,
Girish

Thanks Shakthi. I have been wanting to join a linux mailing list for
some time. I read in wikipedia that in the main list there are around
200-300 messages per day. Is that true?

What is the volume on these lists? Are they manageable?

Can you ask stupid questions there and not get flamed?

Anyway I will right away enroll and lurk for a while.

Thanks again. This was great help.

 I have changed the option in " /etc/squid/squid.conf "
 
 Original :
 
 #Default:
 #emulate_httpd_log off
 
 Changes :
 
 #Default:
   emulate_httpd_log on
 
 Now if i ran " tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log | awk '{print $1 "\t" $3 "\t" $7}' "
 
 I am getting the Client IP address, URL no time and date ?

Can't really help with the HA aspect, but I'd take a look at:

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/mail/postfix-policyd-weight/pkg-descr

"Policyd-weight is (as the name says) a weighted policyd for Postfix.
It uses HELO, MAIL FROM and the MTA IP address for scoring their
correctness. It also uses definable DNSBLs and RHSBLs in a scored
fashion."

I've been using that instead of spamassassin (which can be a memory hog)
and very little spam makes it through.  It's nice in that it doesn't even
have to accept the message body to do it's thing.

Also, consider, clamsmtp

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/url.cgi?ports/security/clamsmtp/pkg-descr

for tying clamav into postfix without having ot use amavisd...

And lastly, you might take a look at roundcube for webmail...

I think I ve explained in my previous post more elaborately how the
command works in a way a layman can understand. I ll stop here,
because I think am making you lazy. Dont take it in a wrong sense but
as Girish said, this is how this community works. Try hard to
understand the concept, fight with google dude to ask him to give the
exact link for your problem, if nothing works then come to the mailing
list to ask people. Its a pretty simple thing you can do, read my
previous mails in this thread carefully, you ll get the answer. Do
post that you have succeeded in getting your problem solved to this
thread, at least I have a feeling that I helped you to know this
thing.

PS: Again I repeat no hard feelings :)

i think it depends on architecture. It must fit into two pages of
memory.ifis or 32-bit x86 architecture and also 64-bit x86
architecture,linux
implements 4k page size.So it is 8kb.correct.
But ,linux implements multiple page size for some other architecture like
for arm(4kb,16kb,32kb), for sparc64(8kb) etc...in that case kernel stack
size would  be varry.....

for 32-bit x86
if i see the PAGE_SIZE macro in /include/asm/page.h, it is like
/*PAGE_SHIFT determines the page size */
#define PAGE_SHIFT      12
#define PAGE_SIZE       (1UL << PAGE_SHIFT).

for sparc64
  #define PAGE_SHIFT   13
 #define PAGE_SIZE    (_AC(1,UL) << PAGE_SHIFT)
 #define PAGE_MASK    (~(PAGE_SIZE-1))

http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/asm-sparc64/page.h?a=sparc64

But it could be configurable during the kernel compilation.

No , i subscribed with kernelnewbies. I used to get daily 10 to 15 mails. I
don't know about kernel janitors mailing list. I think u r talking about
linux kernel mailing list on VGER.KERNEL.ORG server.
Which is for mainline linux kernel tree mailing list...

You have to be  soft. Just u can put , i am a new in linux kernel

Anyway I will right away enroll and lurk for a while.

LKML is a mailing list of heavy traffic, sometimes it goes upto 500-600 
mails per day (especially during release of new kernel version). And, I 
don't think its a place where a kernel newbie can ask questions, since 
people there are very much into other expert jobs. I have seen a few to 
ask questions a bit of off topic considering the normal kind of mails 
there, but only a very few get answered (myself have had asked some 
questions related to support for nvidia video card some 1.5 yrs back and 
got no reply :( )

I have tried to learn something by lurking around in LKML, but often 
found things to be too much techy/geeky for a kernel newbie.


One of the things which makes me to still be on the list is to read 
occasional mails and replies from Linux Torvalds, Alan Cox and co.. :D ;)

Yes this solved my problem. But seeing Binand's reply am gonna try out

That's great.  I tried installing FreeBSD 6.1 on my system some months back,
and my very brief notes on the installation is at
http://freeshell.in/~ramanraj/kr_freebsd.txt

A very small problem here albeit easily solvable. There is no Internet

The only reason I am not using the installation regularly is that I have not
yet figured out  how to configure my Tata  LG  usb modem. I would really
appreciate a brief howto configure usb modems on FreeBSD.

Thank You Girish for the post. I have decided to go for spamassassin
since the sytem resources is not a big issue with me. I have tested
squirrelmail with pluggins for changing ldap password and vacation.

For newbies, kerneljanitors and kernelnewbies are good
mailing lists.

Nobody should ask stupid questions. Simple/basic
questions on the lkml are usually ignored.

You never ask support questions on a developers'
mailing list.

For any project, there are usually two mailing lists
(in general). 

A users' mailing list and a developers' mailing list.
All discussions on development, submission of patches
goes into the developers' mailing list.

You should use the users' mailing list for asking
questions how to use feature X or Y with the software
or for general use of the software.

Greetings!

The photos that I took at the International Conference
on GPLv3 on August 23-24, 2006 at IIM, Bangalore are
available here:

  http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album36

Thanks to IIM, Bangalore, FSUG, Bangalore, members of
deeproot.co.in for organizing the conference. I had a
good time. 

The issues discussed on day one were on DRM, Trusted
(we call it "treacherous") computing, patent
retaliation, tivolisation etc. Day two had discussion
on FLOSS in business, and FLOSS in education.

People had come from different parts of the globe.
There was representation from Free Software Initiative
of Japan (http://www.fsij.org) - Niibe Yutaka,
Masayuki Hatta, and Dr. Tashiro
(http://www.ipa.go.jp).

I did purchase a badge which had the GNU logo and FSF
name on it.

Go  with roundcube man and let us know ur findings. I think with its
ajax interface it is going to be much better than the boring
squirrelmail  interface that is all too familiar for everyone now!

nc doing that is intentional, not a defect of nc.

there are plenty others that give u what u want, socat, socket(1)
and so on.

stuff like socketpipe, sockaccept ....

there are too man of them. enjoy!

i know for sure that socket(1) can solve ur problem of dying after
one connection but i expected u to find that out.

anyway enjoy!

Do be careful deploying random scripts .. squirrelmail has a fairly
active user community so very regular security updates.

You are reasonably sure, if you keep your squirrelmail patched, that
theres no cross site scripting or other hole to break into your server
and spam through it, or steal your user db etc.

Thanks to Suman, Shakthi and Parthan for the advice.

The way I plan to go about learning kernel programming is first take
up something that I want done, for instance, right now my TV
remote is not working. I have to get that working first. Since I
have a pressing need for that I will automatically learn whatever is
reqd to do the job. At the same time I take  care not to put any
deadline. It may take a month or two, so what?

Next, I would read the documentation and spend some time reading
websites like what you guys pointed me to.

After that I will use a cscope like tool to index the source and
generally go about getting my feet wet as to what is where and
gain familiarity with the code organization.

Then I would try to get into device driver development solving some
real life problem.

Mailing lists and books may somewhat help but largely I think they
don't fit into the scheme of things here.

Bcoz I have never relied on mailing lists for learning anything.

I will also keep an open ended time frame like six months or so.

I will never force myself.

Do you guys follow something similar or different?

If any of you guys have any problem getting a hardware to
work under linux like TV cards or USB modems or webcams or
whatever else, get in touch with me personally.

I could gladly get it working for you and also write a driver
if necessarily. The only thing I need from you is that you have
to loan the hardware to me for  a while until I am done.

Yes, you guessed it right,  my idea is to learn and hence not
money.

Can u pls tell me the output of "pcitweak -lv" or  do a
"pkg_add -r pcitools" and send me the output of "lspci -vv" or
"scanpci -v"?

I could see if some readymade solutions are already avaialble.

Compiling the kernel in FreeBSD is dead simple. So if it is just
the question of enabling an option in the kernel I could help
you out.

Hi,

Linux has many different flavors  known as  distributions. Examples are
RedHat, Fedora, Ubuntu, Suse, Gentoo etc. First decide which
distribution you want to use. Each of the distributions have some
differences. Some are easy to use for a new user's point of view, some
are very stable to be run as servers, some need to be compiled from
source etc. (this is what I've learned in my 2 month stint with Linux.
The gurus (I see there a quite a few of them here) please correct me if
I'm wrong)

I'd suggest Ubuntu Linux (http://www.ubuntu.com/). It is easy to install
and use. You can download the CD image from any of the sites mentioned
here - http://www.ubuntu.com/download . The site also has torrent files,
if you want to use BitTorrent. You can also order free CDs from - 
https://shipit.ubuntu.com/. They usually take a month or two to reach you.

'make  world'  builds  the  whole system  (userland,  libraries  etc.)
excluding the kernel.

'make kernel' builds and installs a new kernel.

'make release' will  build a release (bootable ISOs  etc.) given a CVS tag
and a CVS repository.

I would also add that freebsd documentation is fairly good and easy to
follow.  man intro, security, firewall, tuning etc are straightforward
guides.

One of the reasons this works is bcoz FreeBSD is a real operating
system with tightly integrated libc, shell, X window etc..

It is not some sphagetti like linux kernel + GNU tools as is the case
with linux distros

IOW, when I say FreeBSD 6.0, everybody understands what
I mean precisely. To a reasonable level of accuracy the versions
of software I run will be identical.

Whereas when I say I run linux, there are 100s or possibilities.

Even say , something like udev and hotplug which is kernel
related stuff, Debian does it differently from Ubuntu which does
it differently from Gentoo which again is different from RedHat
and so on.

I have run into situations when I compile a simple helloworld program
in C which does not run on a different RedHat release
on the same arch.

Whereas you compile a userland app in linux, copy it to a FreeBSD box
and just run it.

It runs. Why? Bcoz FreeBSD has a linux emulation layer that
dynamically detects the ELF header and invokes the appropriate
emulation subsystem...

It works so well that I can run the closed source  skype which
was built for linux perfectly under FreeBSD.

If you don't believe me, come home and you can talk to your
friend in the US.

And remember that my FreeBSD machine is a 233 MHz Pentium II machine
with broken hardware.

If these reasons don't convince u to try FreeBSD then I don't know
what will. :-)

Girish

Hi all,

In the GPL Conference Meet, when discussion on how we can promote GNU/Linux
to the Schools/Colleges and also to the Public, Mr.Shanker,IIMB Professor
suggested that we could take Video tutorials and make them available online.
There is always hype for Video than text. Even, Novell showed the XGL
concept thru Videos so that People could easily come to know what is 3D
Desktop.

Any ideas/suggestions on this ?

Try out more than one flavor of GNU/Linux distros. Start with Ubuntu, 
try Fedora, try Suse, try Knoppix, try Mandrake... after you have tried 
with a few (atleast a two) adopt one. Each one have their own features, 
it depends upon what suits you. We have our Ubuntu Dapper systems as our 
development boxes. So, as far as an average user is considered most 
distros will fit into your requirements.

If you ask people out here, 99% of them don't themselves consider to be 
Linux-Gurus. We are User's with wide range of experience and we are here 
as a Community to share our experience for mutual benefit and for the 
spirit of community. Everyone can be a guru to you at some point of time ;)

Don't waste shipping CDs, we have them with us. Just get me/us an empty 
CD and you will get your own copy of Ubuntu Dapper/Kubuntu/Edubuntu :) 
(For first 5 requests will get some cool Ubuntu stickers too ;) )

This is best???....Well, this method is very confusing and not all the time
we remember this. All other mailing lists do not have this option set by

Subject: [Ilugc] RFC: Grooming new speakers for FLOSS events
Message-ID: <20060826103036.59715.qmail@web50205.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings!

With the rising number of GNU/Linux User Groups in
colleges, there is a very high demand for
workshop/seminars. As much as I'd love to go to the
colleges where I have already been, there is still
more work to be done at colleges/universities where
students/faculty are still unaware of education and
FLOSS. This is the ultimate challenge.

With your help, we can groom more students/faculty
from various colleges who have already enjoyed the
FLOSS experience to speak/advocate FLOSS.

I request the NRC-FOSS members to have a new link in
their wiki, similar to the Mentors page:

http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/FellowshipMentors

for new speakers interested in advocating FLOSS and
sharing FLOSS knowledge. The page can have four
columns: Name, topic(s) of interest, contact details,
availability. Availability is to check if you are
available on a particular day for a workshop or not.

As a speaker, it doesn't matter if you are a
student/faculty/industry person, or if you can speak
good English or not. As long as you know your FLOSS
stuff, you are passionate about it, and you can
express yourself, you should be fine. Grammar/accent
doesn't matter.

Appreciate any feedback on this,

Thanks,

SK

This is a Novel idea.. I was searching for something like this. It
would be very helpful for the colleges to pick a person very easily
who suits their topic of interest. Waiting for such a nice portal :)

There should be additional info given by each speaker what are the
requirements for them if they need to handle a session. Because in my
experience I ve been to college where they take the FLOSS enthusiast
for granted and treat the "Community as 'unpaid' labour", so in order
to avoid the above we need to have such information in the portal too.

As a first step I would suggest to give them the view of the vastness of
Opensource and how they can use it in their day-to-day life. I remember one
friend of mine who was doing a project in speech processing and analysis was
so excited to hear about Perl and its regular expressions. Until then he
used to do all stuff in C which was not much suited for that kind of
project. The point I am trying to make is before trying to teach them
perl/python we should educate them on various tools available and their
usefulness and create an interest in them. Then separated them in to groups
according to their taste and teach the right tool to the right person. How
many c programmers will not be interested to hear about the deadly
combination of "vi + ctags + cscope"?

I don't understand what you are trying to say. What is different in
FreeBSD's integration of libc, shell, X Windows etc. when compared to
say, Fedora Core's? As far as the sphagetti is concerned, do you know
that FreeBSD and Linux distros share quite a lot of code? GNU Bash,
X.Org etc. are all common to both FreeBSD and Fedora Core. Why does
one becomes sphagetti and the other, tightly integrated?

You are comparing apples and oranges. If you are talking of FreeBSD
6.0, then you should talk of Fedore Core 5 or RHEL 4 or Opensuse 10.
If on the other hand, you want to talk of Linux, then talk of the
BSD's in general - not just FreeBSD.

And it happens identical in the BSD world - FreeBSD does it in one
way, OpenBSD in another, NetBSD in a third way and so on.

Anecdotal evidence notwithstanding, I'm curious to hear which two
releases of Redhat you are talking about here. There have been
situations when this might have happened (when they moved from libc to
glibc, or from a.out to ELF), I find it hard to believe that a "simple
helloworld program" could have caused such grief in any recent
Redhat/Fedora versions.

So? Does this prove anything?

On my desktop, I still prefer Windows XP Pro. On my servers, Redhat Linux.

Forgive my Ignorance but aren't each of the BSDs considered a seperate
OS? The kernel doesn't share any code base unlike different linux
distros do they?

hi this is harish from jaya engineering college
i am planning to do my project in foss and i have decided the idea.. so pls
guide me and i want everybodys comment to implement this project sucessfully




*ABSTRACT*



*This is a career counseling software which will conduct an computer
adaptive psychometric test (computer adaptive test here means that the same
question will be asked after some time in different contest, if a person is
true to himself the answers will be same or otherwise the person writing the
test is simply manipulating the answers, in this case some more questions
will be asked and if the answers are manipulated the user will be told that
the test is being manipulated and it will ask the user to take the test with
sincerity) for analyzing a persons nature and attitude. Based on the result
this will suggest some careers, which will suit the person. The career
suggestions will contain the following:*



?         *Information about the career*

?         *Job profile*

?         *Career path (beginning from higher secondary in a flow chart
format)*

?         *Various institutes offering the course (including study abroad
options)*

?         *Details about the course*

?         *Pays and perks*

?         *Video or audio if necessary*

?         *Experts comments or video clippings pertaining to the career*

?         *Application format*

?         *Links in the world wide web (for reference)*

?         *And many more (open for ideas)*



*Buy using this software the user would get whatever details is required in
one place and the other option here will also be getting information even
without taking the test.*

Bah! Don't be apologetic when you know what you are talking. :-)

You are right, though all BSDs share a common ancestry, the kernel
 code is completely different and so is the userland. You will
understand it well if you take a look at a couple of kernel files.

Though the same mbuf networking packet data structure is used by
all BSDs, and a few other common constructs, mainly scheduler algos
and data structures like queues and stacks, the rest is quite different.

I really don't know how much is the similarity and how much the difference
but I am sure of this. That OpenBSD kernel is roughly 1/10th the size
of FreeBSD kernel, both if you compare the source as well as the binary.


As I have mentioned before I have not played enough with NetBSD yet.

For instance, though all BSDs support cryptographic file systems,
NetBSD's cgd is different from GDBE of FreeBSD which is again quite
different from OpenBSD's svnd.

However the ALTQ networking subsystem for QoS and other things must
be somewhat similar. I am guessing this.

A lot of cross polination happens among the BSDs , but the difference
among them is certainly much more than the difference between linux
distros. It is a little subjective, so let me stop here.

Refer to my reply to Binand's mail for further details.

Well, excuse me for using Hindi. I know it is not the lingua franca in
these parts. It was just a poor attempt to pun the movie titled, "Raju
ban gaya gentleman".

Anyway the FreeBSD install demo started off as a disaster bcoz I
didn't realize the simple fact that ppl won't follow what you are
talking if you don't tell them why you are talking that. :-)

Stupid me! But it is never late to learn. It was a good experience
though as none of the problems that affected the presentation were big
ones , notably the lack of Internet connection, not giving sufficient
notice to ppl and not having a  slide projector.

I think a slide projector would have helped but since Saravanan came
forward with such a quick response to freely share his facilities and
Raja agreeing to bring his laptop readily, I really don't think I have
any right to complain.

I got much much more help than I could ever expect. Many thanks to lug
for that.

I think none of us can thank Raja enough for the excellent run down he
gave on the difference between BSDs, on OpenBSD in particular and also
pf .

Most notable was his anecdotal narratives about the bleeding edge
stuff, how he solved certain problems for clients etc.

Truly enlightening.

Girish

First of all I am very glad that there is a healthy difference of
opinion. Let me try to do my best to clear things up. But please
remember that neither Jordan K Hubbard nor Theo de Raadt is paying me
for this. :-)

And regrettably my knowledge of the kernels of these OSes is not as
good as I wished. If that were true then you could have given more
credence to what I am saying.  As such my replies are only based on
"impressions" and not real technical knowledge. That said, I will do
my best to give an unbiased view.

I probably used too strong a word "sphagetti" though I don't regret it
now since it is definitely close to reality. :-)

No, you are mistaken. *BSD OSes do not rely on GNU tools. They do use
GNU tools, yes; but they don't rely on them. BSD has its own libc(very
different from glic), its own make, its own compiler though these days
nobody uses anything other than gcc.

And BSD has true UNIX roots. Games like fortune and tetris existed on
BSD long ago. csh is the default shell on BSD systems. csh is a really
horrible shell, so it is nothing to be proud of.

And tools like tar,cp, ls etc.. all have a BSD version and a GNU
version. Since GNU version is recent, they are usually much better
than the rusty old UNIX versions. But  then it has also lead to a
certain feature bloat and code expansion.

BSD tar doesnt have a -j option, so it is irritating. But then BSD
also gives you GNU tools with a  g prefix. gtar is the GNU tar and so
on.

Ok. This is not my opinion. This was actually told by Jordan K Hubbard
in an interview. I think the biggest weakpoint of linux is its too
much hype and popularity and lack of focus. Different distros have
different things as focus and there is no common regulatory authority.
It has almost become like different OSes. This is not a good thing.

This is what has brought about interoperability problems and market
fragmentation.

Somewhat subjective why I say it is not a good thing since different
choices for the end user is good but then energy is scattered away in
multiple directions instead of collected in one and focused.

So the tendency of bugs and integration issues increase greatly since
developers don't know who to submit a patch to when they fix a bug.

Hmm, they are completely different OSes. Other than the common parts
in the kernel I spoke about above and some parts of userland, they are
all quite different.

Some of the shell commands and man pages are very similar though. I
find a lot of similarity bet NetBSD and OpenBSD.

Well, ask this on a mailing list and they will tell you why this
happens. Though I am not technically competent to comment on this. All
I can say
is that lack of cleanliness in linux design hurts us sooner or later. This
is only one instance in which linux falls on the face. There are
numerous other but then FreeBSD also has several stupid bugs, so I
think we are not comparing apples and apples here.

In general FreeBSD has sufferred in recent times due to the pressure
to compete with linux and hence, it has lost some of its old charm
,but then
I hope things get better. One of the reasons I have decided to dump
FreeBSD and go in for Net or Open for my products...

Btw, one of the main advantages BSDs have is in their performance and
compatibility on any old hardware. You will be quite surprised to know
that the machine from which I am typing this mail is only 350 MHz and
I can do whatever I want with it. Even watch full screen video with
mplayer.

Redhat cannot install , but Debian certainly would.:-)

Yes, it does of course. I wonder why you don't see that cleanliness
and simplicity of design has achieved something seemingly impossible.

I think this is fantastic; I feel it instinctively though I am not
able to substantiate it with reason. I think if you think for a while
you will get what I mean...

Well, Binand, normally ppl prefer to run *BSD on mail servers,
routers, firewalls etc. and run linux or Windoze on their desktops.

But I use OpenBSD on my desktop and I find it eminently usable and
blazingly fast.

It is purely personal choice buddy. Nobody on earth dare comment on
what any of us choose.:-)

Anyway I am not too happy with this treatment and I do certainly
regret the fact that I don't have inside information; I mean kernel
hacking experience and general anecdotal evidence to support my
claims.

I think it is pertinent to mention that ssh came from OpenBSD, that tc
QoS came from AltQ, that devfs was adapted from BSD, that epoll was
adapted from kqueue and so on.

Even when linux copies from the BSD pioneers, linux often gets it
somewhat inelegant and counterintuitive.

Having said all this, nobody can gainsay the fact that linux enjoys
the sort of popularity, mindshare and focus like no other OS. And it
has several cutting edge features and drivers for nearly every single
hardware on earth.

Let me stop here. :-)

Girish

Hi,

In addition to my last post, here comes one more - A very interesting 
thread discussing about a comparison of BSD and Linux, perhaps in the 
early stages of Linux Developments.

This was what Linux commented on the middle of a flamewar :D

Sorry.  I dislike these flame wars intensely, and I just happen to find
the above "concept" one of the more disgusting ones ("Hey, I'm *macho*,
I use an operating system that is PAINFUL because that way I gain

Next I guess you'll tell me "you get what you pay for".  I haven't been

Google mirror popular mailing lists. You can use this Google Groups

Cool idea man! :-)

I am sure there are some Ajax studs over here who will willingly lend you
a helping hand.

How to make the static map first? I don't know. Maybe inkscape, gimp or
blender or xfig? or Openoffice?

I may be offtrack but not orthogonal to what you want.

I would not use a database bcoz the datasize is too small. You are not
changing anything, so you don't need transactions.

KISS. Keep things simple and stupid.

If I were you I would just use a hashtable in C or a file or some such
thing.

For zooming you got to use some cool truetype fonts or something.

Something that doesn't break under the weight of heavy zooming in.

Ok, I have run dry. Someone else should jump in now.

FWIW linux has clearly won the battle though FreeBSD is eating
into its share.

My only fear is that due to the heavy fragmentation and popularity,
linux will suffer since getting pulled in all directions, code quality
and stability might suffer.

But I am no Malthus or Murphy. :-)

I will be very glad if proven wrong.

Actually it was a Usenet newsgroup. Google has been archiving and
hosting Usenet discussions from 1981 and their Google Groups is a web
front end for that
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet#Archives_and_Web_Interfaces).
Google has actually complied some milestone events from its 20 year

http://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html. Pretty
interesting stuff in there.

Dear ILUGC,

I have a few ISO images of various GNU/Linux and BSD installer CDs
(minimal). I was wondering whether I could use GRUB to boot them from
my existing GNU/Linux system, avoiding the need to burn them onto a CD
to start the installation procedure. Is there a way to do this?

Thanks.

if u want to try it on an emulator like qemu, yes u can.. but with GRUB,
AFAIK, no.. or any ways to do it?

How about using Qemu?
http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/

Its as simple as this. If you have a iso image say GnoWare.iso
$ qemu -cdrom /media/hda8/GnoWare.iso -boot d

Definitely possible, I have installed that way many times.
The procedure is like this:
1. loop mount the iso image and copy the kernel, ramdisk image, and the
modules to some partition accessible from grub.
2. Find out the options to be passed to the kernel. Its listed in
isolinux/isolinux.cfg in the dapper iso image, it might be differet for
others.
3. Reboot the system and enter the grub command prompt.
4. Boot the kernel with the options noted down in step 2.
eg:
root (hd0, 6)
kernel /iso/vmlinuz boot=casper ramdisk_size=1048576 root=/dev/ram rw quiet
splash --
initrd /iso/initrd.gz
boot
5. After booting, the kernel will probe for cdrom devices and will fail and
will probably drop you in a rescue shell.
6. From the rescue shell, you can use losetup to link the loop device to the
iso image and then create a link /dev/cdrom pointing to the loop device. You
might require to insmod the 'loop' module if its not already present.
7. Continue with the installation.

This procedure worked for Debian & Ubuntu atleast but it should be possible
with others as well. You can always customize the ramdisk if needed.

Oh ok. You wanted to install things and not just run like a live CD!
Sorry. Did not see your question properly. Yes looping works. I have
also done it quite a few times

You must  install boot image to the floppy disk ( will be available in the
CD AFAIK).
Boot with floppy.
Use the option to install from hard drive .
Point the location of the iso image.

To install image to floppy we can use dd command.
But this will be applicable to Linux I am not aware of  *BSD.

BSD world doesnt use grub, you can use but ppl normally avoid and
moreover only FreeBSD understands grub's command line passing to the
kernel. Since each BSD has its own boot loader, grub is not normally
used.


I use the command,

qemu -m 256 -cdrom freebsd.iso

But bear in mind that qemu is only an emulator and it only shows you
how things look and work. There is no way you are going to know if
things really work on the hardware you plan to install.

Someone gave a lengthy procedure of loop mounting, copying to hard
disk etc. It will be great if the reboot cycle could be avoided.
Otherwise the approach seems to be somewhat fine.

Can u use user mode linux or chroot for it? I wonder.

But qemu seems to be the best way.

Or u can boot it from a USB key. But the iso can't be copied. USB key
boot code is similar to floppy's though I wonder if it is the same. It
might be.

With some minimal change, you can loop mount the iso and run syslinux
to change El Torito (for CDROM) to floppy format and boot from USB.

For BSDs, not much info is there on the web on how to do the USB
thing. I am sure I will figure it out soon...

I may be wrong and kindly excuse my ignorance.

What makes you think Redhat is going to make an ISO available for
download? Has RedHat ever done that? :-)

Guys, plz spare me as I have no idea what Redhat is upto or what it

Dear Friends,

We need our imagination to amalgamate  for  planning & preparing events on
the software freedom day.
I think this time , it will be difficult to organise "freedom  walk" because
of the organiasational constraints and time factor. Correct me if i am
wrong. We have to give proposal to ELCOT, we have to finaliase our agenda.
Mean while i would volunteer to keep a "Joomla Day" on SFD '06.

Cheers,

How about we ask participants to put their creativity in making a good
lively desktop theme and showcase them ?. And also there are so many dekstop
goodies avaialble, so we can see who makes a good desktop stack :)

Cognizant Auditorium (TCO, Thoraipakkam...15 min from IIT-Madras). Seating
capacity upto 200.

b) A video camera and a cameraman


Yes, Not a  professional  grade though.

The auditorium has a very good Sound System.

d) A projector that can maker sure that people sitting in the last row
> can clearly read the text


Yes, comes with the Auditorium.

e) Other logistics that I don't remember


I don't remember them either.

Let me know the dates in Advance (1 week) so that I can confirm your talk.

Hi,

Joomla day is a day to show case "Joomla" one of the most  comprehensive
easy to build website through cms. It has many relevance to software freedom
day. Generally we say "Linux Demo day" as a premier model of any open source
event. Like the LDD , Joomla day is a day where events are organised to
popularise the use of Joomla CMS.

Joomla Day will have lot  of importance for audience for reasons Joomla is a
tool for Non Tech guy to publish maintain his content and  happily run
his/her show , for Tech guys joomla  has many facets one of which is
breading ground for learning MVC style code which may be helpful in learning
the other MVC like phpcake, phpsymfony, rails.. etc.

More info at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joomla


I rest for now

Cheers

Nice Info Thyagu ;) Carry on with your Joomla Efforts ! :)

MIT guys are planning to invite schools around and have a small 
awareness session for students and teachers. The idea was proposed by 
Raman and me to the MITlug and I have reminded them to decide within 
this weekend :)

Message-ID: <00ad01c6ca86$bbd49f20$5c00000a@sripriyan>

Hi all

I am using RH linux 7.1(kernel 2.4.2-2). And i want to enable
Framebuffer(FB) in my kernel. I enabled FB in the kernel as mentioned below,
  a.. Code maturity level options --->
    a.. Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
(CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL=Y)
  b.. Console drivers --->
    a.. VGA text console (CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=Y)
    b.. Video mode selection support (CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=Y)
      a.. Frame-buffer support --->
        a.. Support for frame buffer devices (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIG_FB=Y)
        b.. VESA VGA graphics console (CONFIG_FB_VESA)
        c.. Advanced low level driver options (CONFIG_FBCON_ADVANCED=Y)
        d.. Monochrome support (CONFIG_FBCON_MFB=Y)
        e.. 2 bpp packed pixels support (CONFIG_FBCON_CFB2=Y)
        f.. 4 bpp packed pixels support (CONFIG_FBCON_CFB4=Y)
        g.. 8 bpp packed pixels support (CONFIG_FBCON_CFB8=Y)
        h.. 16 bpp packed pixels support (CONFIG_FBCON_CFB16=Y)
        i.. 24 bpp packed pixels support (CONFIG_FBCON_CFB24=Y)
        j.. 32 bpp packed pixels support (CONFIG_FBCON_CFB32=Y)
      With the above .config file i ran,
      b.. make dep
      c.. make bzImage
      d.. copied the bzImage into /boot dir
Then i included the line ` append="vga=791" ` in my lilo.conf.

After rebooting i found that frame buffer is not enabled.

this additional info could help,

# fbset
open /dev/fb0: No such device
# ls -l /dev/fb0
crw--------    1    root    root    29,    0    Mar    24    2001
/dev/fb0
# cat /proc/fb
#

I understood that the above fbset and cat /proc/fb commands din't respond as
expected. Could it be because of my PC configuration(intel845, samsung
samtron 45Bn)? Can anyone throw some light on it ?
Thanks and Regards

Check the usual suspects... bad cdrom/hdd, incorrectly
installed boot loader, kernel support for your hardware,
and more vague suggestions.

If you don't post a detailed description of your problem
(include error messages and version of suse, hardware
description, etc.) nobody will be able to help you.

IMHO, the Ubunteros in ilugc have shipped enough number of Ubuntu CDs 
(all 3 flavors) and have a copy with them. Those who require these CDs 
may contact any one of them, get them an empty CD and get Ubuntu burnt 
within few minutes. Why to ship the CDs when you have enough resources 
available locally ??

Ubuntu CDs are available with..

1. Parthan
2. Aanjhan
3. Bhuvan
4. Raman

and many more. If you can make it to the next LUG meet, anyone of the 
above will be able to give you a copy, provided they are inform in prior. :)

This is possible in distros like fedora, where u can use the usb to
boot from a USB. Fedora comes with a USB boot image. if such a image
exists just dd the image into a USB and lo u have a bootable USB, by
passing certain arguments to the kernel u can install of the ISO
images on the HDD.

Use fbset like this:

  fbset -fb /dev/fb0

I am not sure if this is necessary since I have never passed a single
option to the kernel so far and I have got my framebuffer working.

Well, what you have enabled are the software abstractions for the
framebuffer interface and fonts. There is no need to choose so many of
them. Just one would be sufficient.

But the main thing is the framebuffer driver that drives the hardware.
That is the tricky part. I don't know if Intel845 is supported by the
kernel you are using. Just google for it.

If that doesn't work then you might be lucky and vesafb might do the
trick. Enable that also.

Also it might be better to run 2.6.x kernel...

Best,
Girish

Well, this page says otherwise.
http://wiki.lunar-linux.org/index.php/Installation:No_CD

With just three commands, you can do wonders.

losetup /dev/loop0 lunar-1.5.1-i686.iso
mount /dev/loop0 /mnt -o ro
chroot /mnt /sbin/lunar-install

Just replace the /sbin/lunar-install command with an appropriate one,
that is all.

chroot is very powerful! In fact you can run linux  inside linux very
easily using chroot
whereas uml is somewhat painful.

Debian also gives a very easy procedure for USB keyflash boot. It is
really very straightforward.

I am looking out how to do it for *BSD.

You are really making me blush.

Since I have a long way to go as regards preparation and I am fighting
between devil and deep sea as my hardware is giving me trouble, my
work is sufferring big time and personal commitments wasted some time...

I don't have words to thank you. That is all I can say. I still feel that
video is a luxury; the only reason I am stressing for that is that it
can be of use for those folks in the US and elsewhere and also for
the general public . If someone sees the video from youtube, eefoof or
elsewhere and gets interested in ilugc, I think it will be great.

You have made me redouble my efforts and get ready fast.
We also have to plan for a date that is convenient for folks to book
their air and bus/train tickets and even for localites to become somewhat
mentally prepared.

I think that is important, since you should be relaxed in order to absorb
the maximum. :-)

Ok, I feel bad again that I have not made enough progress. I am sure
I will get back on track pretty soon.

Thanks again.

regards,
Girish

AFAIK this option is necessary, because the video mode has to be selected
using the BIOS calls and this can only be done before the kernel enters into
the real mode. So the kernel should decide in a very early stage if it
should enter text mode/graphics mode - This decision is made based on the
boot parameter.

Please pardon my ignorance. I cannot afford 64 bit machines.

Please pray tell me how and why this is needed. Won't they
work under 32 bit emulation? Is it a shared lib problem?

Thanks.

May I politely interject here? Thanks.

I know that you are only quoting from an ancient thread but we should
stop talking about or even thinking about Minix.

It is an academic project by Tananbaum. He may be a great teacher and
an academician but one should remember that he is not an engineer.

We are engineers and hackers and we want things that work and work
well in the real world.

So let us safely lock Minix in the old rusty trunk box in your bedroom
and go try, the BSDs and breathe some fresh air.

Nobody is stopping you from writing your own device drivers for these
successful open source operating systems used by large corporations
with millions of dollars.

Don't waste your time doing projects of academic interest.

My two cents.

Girish

Minix was and is used in the real world.  Minix 3 was released this year.

And just to make things clear ... that was Linus' post announcing
Linux (or Freax, as I think he wanted to call it).

U shud remember the ugly row bet Linus and Tanenbaum.

Tanenbaum was suggesting a modular kernel. Linus is not a guy
who minces his words.

He clearly told him to keep quiet. He is a professor and let him
attend to teaching.

And who won the game? Linus or Tananbaum?

One can sit and talk theory and write books. But to make
a product succeed in the real world is an altogether ballgame.

That is what we should be interested in.

Anyway forget Tananbaum.

Understand my idea clearly. I want everyone to get practical.

Close your textbooks, unlearn some of what your professors
taught you, forget stuff like multithreading is the way to go and
that databases should be used for storing records and all that.

Go, look at the source code of well written programs that work
well in the real world. Understand the design. Try to fix bugs,
improve things and experience it.

Experience is the only way to learn.

Girish

Yes, but how was Linus able to come out with a kernel(OS) called  Linux ?.
Without Minix,  today there would not have been Linux. Telling  not to
discuss about Minix is something bad. If you are not sure how Linus started
to build a kernel, do read "Just For Fun" which explains Linus life.


That is what we should be interested in.

This is not practical. What sort of an advice would be to forget the
"databases for storing records","forget multithreading". I dont get what you
are trying to explain here.I respect my Professors who taught me well about
these BASIC CONCEPTS that one must know and keep updated himself. If you are
not strong with the FOUNDATION, its waste.

> Don't waste your time doing projects of academic interest.

This advice is really bad. What sort of an advice is this to a College
student?.

BSD is OK for you and its your choice. For many , it might not.

As far as my small brain remembers, the origin of the Linux is related 
to Minix. Also, we weren't trying to put up anything related to 
Tananbaum here. We were just recollecting something from ancient threads 
which were "init" scripts for some history to happen later. :)

Again, Mine and Roshan's earlier posts where just a recollection of 
Linus's first post, about what later became Linux. It was made to just 
remember what happened almost 15 years ago, when nobody thought 
something called as Linux might ever come :) Its just to celebrate the 
day by recalling how it all started. :)

Does this sound practical --> From tomorrow all KG kids will be given a 
book of Harry Potter and be asked to read a page per day ?

Duh! How can students understand the source code and the logics embedded 
in them without understanding the basics. Learning or knowing about the 
things which you tag as ancient history is a way of appreciating all 
good works and dedication having been put for years, to have what we 
have today. What you mean is like asking to throw out all 'Fundamentals 
of Electronics" books and ask people to open up their mobile phones and 
start developing things... OMG!

if i am not wrong, he is copying the iso on a partition and and using
a boot loader to boot it.  The chroot part is done by the kernel right
after kernel initialization.

Infact this step is done by all the distros that i have come across.
this script is generally placed in the initrd img file that we
genrally pass to the kernel.

remember if u want to do the above, u shouldn't have any other kernel
running. two kernel cannot run at the same time unless u go for  XEN
or UML( both of which requires kernel recompilation.)




my two cents.

Do you have some conf file for squidGuard? Look for it in /etc if you
have a default install. It will be something like this
/etc/squidGuard.conf. In that you ll get the required info where the
default db folder is present. Since I ve made a custom install in
which I ve compiled squid and squidGuard from source I have my own
paths where I have these db and things like that, so I dont know where
exactly the squidGuard db goes for a default install :)

You are absolutely correct Sai and I am also right bcoz this
is exactly what Kumar Appaiah wanted.

Or qemu of Vmware. qemu needs no kernel compilation though
it may help speed up.

I am a lil dense about this bochs, qemu, vmware, xen virtualization
stuff. Seems like a hot topic but never got around to learning it.

Oh my God! I never intended to hurt anyone!

If it happened inadvertently just pardon me and move on.

My apologies to one and all. I think there are too many of
them, so I am not able to enumerate here.

What I am aiming for is a healthy marriage of academia
and industry. The two have differring goals and have to
work with each other instead of one without the other.

Both are required. Without teachers and professors teaching
us stuff, we can never become engineers.

And without engineers doing real world work teachers cannot
test their hypotheses.

And I find too much academic discussions on this list. I
read this here, that there. Few ppl actually talk from
their experience. My humble intention was only that
and nothing else.

I apologize for all the hard feelings. I know I cannot
make up for it, but at least I can try.

And the reason I asked ppl not to waste time on academic
projects is not asking ppl not to do academic projects.

OTOH, take up a real life problem, solve it. Make it an
academic project. Who is stopping you from that?

I never meant to break or hurt anything. I don't believe
in revolutionary approach. Things have to happen slowly
by way of evolution.

Sorry again. I never meant to break anyone's heart!

Are the specs open? In which case some
implementation is possible. I think IEEE charges
 several $$$$$ for these specs.

Or is it too bleeding edge that an implementation is not ready yet?

I think if you have IEEE subscription you can download the specs from
the website.

What I mean to say is that you might have to use a strategy different
from google for this. :-)

Best is to get in touch with an academic institution which usually has
access to IEEE documents.

Thanks for the input.

A few initial blocks that would require addition/modifacation of existing
802.11a/g  port to linux. These would be multiple configuration of MAC
layer(based on Base Station, CPE Subscriber Satation and many others who 
would like to put there existing ass in 4G) and alternative techniques 
applied to PHY modules like OFDMA.

In Linux implementation of [0802.16 + 802.16e(mobile)], what are the
reference for wireless broadband frame header?

I need more input in this discussion..

Raja

Message-ID: <15C2CAD382CB69409395ED4F159BED700AE1E1@mail.esntechnologies.co.in>


Dear All,

While creating the soft link using the command ln -s on the mounted
partition, the following error message is appearing:

ln: creating soft link to target. Operation Not Permitted.

I am able to create the soft link to the same file to the target at the
local disk.

I tried the following way to resolve the issue:
Compressed required files from the mount point, extracted to the local
disk, created the required symbolic links and then again putting back on
the mount point.

In spite of this, the same error is repeating when I extracted the files
back to the mount point.

Can any one provide a pointer to create a soft link on the mount points.

Regards,
Srinivas G.

What sort of filesystem are you mounting? Does it support symlinks?

64 bit versions of  java/flash/openoffice were not available when I last
tried a 64 bit distro, so I had to install 32 bit versions of these
applications. 32 bit applications needs 32 bit versions of the libraries
(libc, pthread, gtk, ...) and multi lib support was not availabe (i.e, 32
bit and 64 bit libraries cannot co-exist) so these applications were
installed on a separate partition along with the dependent 32 bit libraries.
32 bit applications can now be executed after chrooting to the new
partition. All the mess can be avoided when multilib will finally be in Edgy
eft. I guess Gentoo already supports mixed libraries.

strangely enough, although philosophicaly i dont agree with Girish,  
in practice, in the Indian context I do. The problem here is the  
'scratch my itch' philosophy, which implies two things. One is that  
we prefer to start our own project rather than contribute to existing  
projects. And, secondly, we do not look to see if the project is  
useful before starting. Why does government implement so little FOSS?  
One reason is that there is no one available to write FOSS code. We  
have got a govt project to implement completely in FOSS (maybe first  
time in India), but can we get people to code for it? At govt  
salaries it is impossible to get good inhouse coders - and  
unfortunately, those who can do it are too busy scratching their itches.

Hi all,

I would like to do MBA (Technology Management / Systems) in Distance
Learning. Recently, Anna Univ. has started a Distance Learning Centre.
Does any one know about the Syllabus for MBA (Tech. Mgmt.) at CDE,
Anna Univ? How worth is the course? The Anna Univ, CDE site has very
less information and Google returned 0 search result. Or is there any
other better CDE for MBA Distance Learning If so which one?  Please
reply.


Anna. Univ.,CDE is delivering OSS through its Course Materials (Info
from CDE Site).

Thank you,

I understand your concern for FOSS. But if students do implementation
projects as their final year projects, it wont be respected when it comes to
either academia or any *non-service based* companies. Students may do FOSS
projects for their own interest but not for their final year project, which
should be a project of academic interest for the wellbeing of the student.

I don't see any reasoning here. Never make
assumptions.

Because most academic institutions in India don't
collaborate with the industry, the so-called
"engineering student" doesn't know what is happening
in the industry. So, your intention is primarily to do
what your seniors did.

FLOSS is used/developed in the industry in India.

For those, who are not  familiar with CNR, please do read
here<http://www.linspire.com/products_cnr_whatis.php?tab=warehouse>

Its the most easiest way of installing apps in Linux as far as I have seen.

The CNR client's source code will be released soon, so that many other
distros too can use the CNR client with their repos.

Amit,

You have asked too many questions here.

Pls understand that my words were interpreted out of context and
sentimentally analyzed. Nobody took the time to understand what I am
feeling deep inside when I spoke those words.

Of course my words were incendiary in nature and I had taken an
extremist stance which I now regret. Extremism does do good but it
leads to lot of bloodshed in the short term.

I personally have no anathema againt anything or anybody. In fact I
love Win XP for its stability , the applications supported by it and
ease of use. There was a time when I used to hate Microsoft and used
to love UNIX. But after several years I realized that any religious
allegiance or hatred only does harm and no good.

At the same time when MBA folks tell me that technology doesn't
matter, only result matters; I disagree with them vehemently bcoz
unless you use the right technology and the right tools you cannot
achieve your end.

And you cannot become good at something by being technology agnostic.

For now, to answer the most important question as I understand at the
top of your mind, here goes.

By "projects of academic interest" , I dont mean academia or industry.
There are several real life projects developed in universities. google
is an academic project, TCP/IP was developed in UCB and SUN is
Stanford University Network.

So ppl will laugh at me if I say that academia should only teach and
engineers should only do real life projects.

What I mean by "academic interest" are the sort of futuristic research
done by IBM T J Watson research center, AT & T Bell Labs and MIT media
lab projects. No, I dont mean to make a blanket statement here.

What I mean is many of these things dont matter at all to the common
man. They are done for pure research purposes.

This is what I don't like. No, I have nothing against research. But
from whatever I have observed about India and the Indian mind all
these years I feel that everyone goes into R & D mode at the drop of a
pin taking shelter in theory alone.

At the same time I have also met a lot of very good coders who start
coding at the drop of a pin.

What I think works is a proper balance of the two.

You need a solid conceptual and theoretical grounding first. On top of
that you build a product and then, once people start using it, you
will understand that what people want is really very different from
what you started with.

And you will have to make lot of changes for portability, for bug
compatibility, do ugly things like use the sleep statement for getting
it to work or put in hacks to make it not fail under certain
circumstances.

IOW, I mean to say that even if you have the brain of Albert Einstein,
unless your product is proven in the crucible of the real world, when
thousands of people use it in situations that Einstein himself couldnt
imagine(largely bcoz Einstien is not as stupid as an average Joe user
:-), until then, the product cannot be trusted.

i.e, I mean to say that a product should become truly idiot proof and
you should fix corner cases and other bugs that crept in due to your
assumptions which no longer hold good in the real world.

Now, coming to Minix, the statement sent by Roshan that Minix really
gave folks a chance to write device drivers... This might have been
true in the early 90s, when nobody knew about the open source
phenomemon. At that time, nobody had access to any kernel code. Only
employees of Sun , Novell , IBM, DEC etc...

But now, a lot of water has flown under the bridge. Today open source
has moved out of academia and hacker's hobbies and become more
mainstream than any other thing.

It came as a deluge and every single company in the world today should
owe a certain gratitude towards the great people who wrote open source
programs.

Believe me, I have seen some of the best companies in the world taking
open source code, only slightly modifying it, throwing in some masala
and then making products out of it. Very few of them actually follow
GPL laws. In fact many companies don't even acknowledge that they use
open source.

Whereas BSD licensing is very very business friendly. You can use the
code and do whatever you want with it. Moreover BSD code is also rock
solid unlike linux. Linux may have 1000s of features but when it comes
to doing something and doing well , nobody can beat BSD.

So it is only in this sense that I said that talking about Minix two
decades after it was born , especially when Minix has transmogrified
into linux and since Minix is hardly used is braindead to put it
euphemistically.

At the same time if you have nostalgia about something like the TCP/IP
stack or C or basic UNIX shell commands like  cat or vi, then that
makes sense.

Bcoz though equally old, these programs have weathered real life use
and proven themselves. The fact that TCP/IP or cat has hardly changed
speaks very highly of the foresight and the brilliance of the
designer.

Hope I make myself clear now.

regards,
Girish

This is a self-imposed myth which has been made into reality. Students
doing implementation have been accepted by some of the examiners
provided the output is something worthwhile. Most of the time, some
screenshots and simulations are shown which naturally gives further
boost to the notion of "ban on implementation projects".

One major reason is the time factor. In my discussions with variuos
LUG members and academia, we have been trying to work out a via media
: divide the project into two parts -- one part for submission to the
univ and then proceed to comeplete the rest. Of course, the notion is
just a year or two old. Students (and univesity) need time to
understand and nurture this.

However, if we liberalise the definition to " using open source tools"
which could be put in FOSS, the number has been increasing
significantly. Before I joined NRCFOSS, I had 3 groups of students
working in what I could call the FOSS arena. There are a number of
colleges -- TEC, Sona, Kongu, Jaya, Muthayammal, Jerusalem .. under
Anna Univ (and I am sure some more in other univesities) -- who have
already made a beginning.

Should I make a protest of "child labor"? In the college we should
train the student to get used to examples, guided development which
enables him or her to contribute later. The tone of our interactions
here seem to seek only the "Prashant Mohans". While I welcome them I
would also like to seek 20-30 average but enthusiastic & committed
students for each Prashant Mohan.

If the "seniors" who are now out in the industry guide their juniors
with worthwhile ideas, this can change -- and is changing, let me say,
5 to 10 % every year. The students need lot of handholding, but I am
not sure how many mentors have that much time or patience. From my own
experience at Arunai,  guys like Sudarsun (Checkatronix), Nagappan /
Varadhan (Novell) -- I know a few more in the industry but not in FOSS
-- have done this and are doing it.

Srinivasan, NRCFOSS.

I  am only bothered about India right now. There is really nothing
else working in my brain.

How to make India stand shoulder to shoulder with the West is my only
problem today. When countries like Israel and Ireland can do it , then
why not India?

Though we have technical superstarts of International calibre, we are
not able to make a single commercial product or an open source
project.

Why? It is bcoz of several reasons. It is really not possible to
enumerate my thought process in a single email bcoz the problem is a
deep one and I have only begun to find the solution. Most importantly
I really have no practical experience in solving the problem.

And also I have not succeeded in my endeavor. My success lies in your hands. :-)

I will be brutally frank bcoz we are a mature race and we can take any
amount of criticism. I am willing to take any amount of brickbats from
you also. I really don't care as I have no vested interest here, only
love for India...

1) Companies like Infosys, Wipro, TCS and the media attention recd by
folks like Narayana Murthy have done 100 times more harm than good.
Why?

How do you think these companies make money? Is it by intellectual
efforts trying to prove that they have the best ppl or the best
product?

No, no and no.

They go and say, " Dear America, don't worry. We Indians are here to
wash your floor, to wipe your car clean and make you happy. We are not
fair skinned like you, so we cannot create products. We can only obey
you. "

Then HCL goes and says, " Hey , Infosys quoted 100 $ per hour. We in
Chennai get much better ppl than Blore at the fraction of the cost. So
give the project to me"

And so on and so forth and the problem continues.

What happens to you and me? Nobody gets time to build domain expertise
or self confidence. Already we are very low on self esteem. On top of
that you are switched from project to project depending on the needs
of the client. And you are made to work for long hours bcoz the client
puts pressure on you.

Tell me something. How will your brain be creative if you work for 18
hours a day that too doing junk work?

It kills your individuality and you become a vegetable.

What is the way out? You take a H1B visa and go to US or Europe or go
for higher studies? Is that picture rosy?

No. In fact one of the most successful guys is Vipul Ved Prakash,
famous for the anti spam software Vipul's razor.

And is he an IITian? Is he an engineer even? No,he is a dropout from
college. What does this prove?

The best place to do worldclass technical work is India. Today nobody
can say, "Oh India is a poor third world country, we don't have good
infrastructure and access to technology. We have brains and we put in
hard work but then we are at a disadvantage."

Wrong. It is just a lame excuse. The sort of thing that your grandpa
can say. Not you, with the freshness of youth about you.

You , my dear students are the future of our country. Today in what
way are you disadvantaged ? Don't you have access to a computer? Or
Internet? In fact broadband is cheaper than electricity in Chennai.

My dearest students, my appeal to you is very simple. Be bold, have
faith in yourselves. That you have all it takes to brave the world.
Whoever told you that you are second to someone? You are second to
none.

Stand up and work with all your energies and have fun. The amount of
fun you can have solving real life problems that you and I face are a
1000 times more than the fun you have in talking and learning abstract
theory.

Nobody can talk about this but me since I used to be a very very
theoretical person myself. I used to revel in designing, concepts and
flying above 30,000 feet. In fact I used to touch base with reality
only on an as needed basis. :-)

I distinctly remember how I used to feel those days. I always longed
for support. I always wanted someone else to support me. I couldn't
code myself, so my ego grew saying that coders are doing junk work.

And it is after a long protracted battle of around a year and after
facing failure in my career that I really got down to trying small C
programs, exercising the brain to solve technical problems instead of
just read and think.

And slowly as time passed by, month after month, my confidence started
increasing. Without my own knowledge.

Today after five years I feel that I am really second to none. Bcoz I
can very easily verify where I stand. All I have to do is send a patch
to an open source project or develop an open source program myself.

Anyway I have rattled on. I have work to do.

Girish

My dear students,

   Here are the list of practically relevant solutions for issues
   that people are facing. If you come up with good implementations I think
   some LUG members with the right contacts could even put you on to
investors who can turn your prototypes into products for the Indian
and International market. No, I am not an investor. :-)


   First the computer science problems.

   1) Develop a simple, easy to use command line RSS reader for UNIX
systems. By RSS I mean RSS feeds. Don't do it in Java. I want C. Or
perl,python or ruby.

   2) Noorul Islam (noorul.islam@gmail.com also on LUG) is currently
working on developing a new generation split program. Read the man
page of split. It has several deficiencies. If you come up with a good
implementation, I suggest improve upon the existing code if reqd, then
it can have lot of value. Even simple things like splitting at a
particular offset, or at a particular %, or splitting into n parts are
not supported. I have looked for alternatives,  I found none.

  This has lot of application in audio, video processing.

 3) Develop a simple VoIP application that can work across NAT and
firewalls. This is not difficult. Refer to my article in linuxjournal
or LinuxForYou of  Aug month for details. Don't get scared reading my
article, it is not difficult to code it. I have already given the
design and code in the article.

 4) Develop a command line e-mail client that talks IMAP, SMTP and
POP. Remember , there is competition here. If you support SSL also,
this has lot of potential.

 5) Develop a liveCD or liveDVD or liveUSB that is customized with
bare minimum functionality. It will be good if you use a lightweight
window manager like Windowmaker or XFCE. It will be great if it comes
customized with local language support.

 6) Develop a simple instant messaging and presence protocol , not as
complicated as XMPP.  This is cliche and a favourite acad project. If
you do it different, you win.

 7) A simple application to encrypt and decrypt files on disk. User
should be able to select the encryption algo. If you can also lock it
down to USB keys, it will be great. User has a secure date store that
he can plug in to computers. You should also copy protect and make
sure it doesnt leave the keydrive.

8) Develop a stripped down version of mplayer for playing videos and songs.

9) Develop a music jukebox software that plays sounds on different
networked computers with a single mediation server that talks to all
machines thro' TCP/IP. If done well this has great entertainment
potential.

10) Develop a simple download accelerator that opens multiple TCP
connections and downloads a single file in parts and reassembles it.

The above projects take anywhere between 1 to 10 months to do. It
doesn't need more than three or four ppl. In fact all my projects I
have done alone. So if you so prefer you can also do it individually.

Here are the list of electronics projects. I am not quite clued in ,
but some of them may be interesting.

1) Develop a simple PLL based FM radio

2) Use LDR(Light Dependent Resistors) to do something creative. Don't
do what is cliche like counting the number of ppl entering a room or
something. You have to combine sophisticated software proceesing to do
something useful with it. For instance, you could measure the voltage
output to figure out the luminosity of a place or something. Or you
could combine this with temperature sensor and do something. I don't
know. You find out.

3) Develop a simple remote control using lirc and linux. You can
interface with the serial port, use a simple IR diode and learn the
serial interface protocol. It is really simple.

4) Build a simple digital clock that plays polyphonic tones for each
hour. I should randomly play a tune; it will be interesting. You can
seed the PRNG from an array. You don't need much entropy for this to
be interesting.

5) There are several projects you could do with cheap microcontrollers
these days. Need not just be 8051. You could develop a simple sensor
that weighs, one rupee, two rupee and five rupee coins and dispenses a
ticket or something.

6) You can develop a burglar alarm that detects tampering. Once you do
that it will be simple to make it a house security system.

7) You can do some cool DSP based stuff like SDR(Software Defined
Radio).You can do GSM communications or DRM(Digital Radio Mondiale)
decoding using a general purpose computer and some C code.

8) Or you could use real DSP chip to do simple mp3 decoding. With a
lil bit of knowledge of FIR filters, Kaiser windows etc. and FFT , you
can do something interesting. No, I don't know anything more than
this. This project appears somewhat non trivial.

9) You could buy a Nokia bluetooth dongle and develop a simple
bluetooth handheld. May not be trivial but you could learn Bluetooth.
:-)

10) Develop a simple voice recorder with a USB interface.
       	

These are some of the top of the mind ideas I have. None of them have
had the luxury of a protracted thought process. So I can't guarantee
success but it will certainly help you learn and do something
practically relevant.

Understand that success invariably comes after a few failures. Prepare
to fail first. Otherwise your success won't be sweet. :-)

Wish you Godspeed!

love,
Girish

Binand,

I don't think I will ever be able to explain. Just forgive me. That is all.

Tananbaum is a great researcher, all networking knowledge I have is
thanks to him only.He took the pains to write a great book. In fact
it is only his networking book and Richard Stevens book that I got
my first job. How can I possibly feel thankless?

I only wanted to clearly make out the difference between the focus of
a professor and an engineer, that is all.

The world needs both; but the need of the hour right now in India is
good engineers. We already have plenty of great professors.

regards,
Girish

I'm really curious here; what's your educational background? None of
the projects you list can be called computer science projects.

In addition, several of those have working implementations already.

Taking this debate in a more generic level :
Is contributing to Foss good for a IT Professional / aspiring IT
professionals....?

My view on this:

I see this something similar to paying taxes.

Sure , we all have hesitation in paying taxes. Particularly when we see most
of our tax money is going waste in mindless projects.

So naturally any sensible person will raise this question: When my hard
earned money and my hard efforts are only going  waste why the hell should i
pay taxes and contribute ...?

I would not advise a person contribute to a foss project which is either
repetitive or not of any real use and is just of some academic interest.

It is like advising some one to honestly pay his taxes, when no convincing
benefits and envisaged.

Therefore it is very important that the Foss efforts and Foss project
initiatives have to be really well thought ones. Foss projects, at the end
have to  be  addressing real  issues and be providing really
useful solutions to issues.

Having said that i would like to also point out the dangers of not
contributing to common causes like the tax and the foss.

a bit of history :

In the 9/10th century a few ministers to the king of northern India ( fore
fathers of the pritiviraj-samyukda) proposed to build a strong wall,
completely closing the kiber pass.( something similar to the the great wall
of china) .

The ministers advised the kind to levy a special "wall tax" on the people
for the construction.

But the people agitated and refused to pay the "wall tax". After some time,
the tax proposal and the wall project was dropped.


Many years after drooping the proposal Ghajini Mohammed was planning to
visit india  and found the kiber pass  to be the effortless way to enter. He
succeeded and looted  all the wealth and returned .

He used that route to repeatedly visit india in the 9th/10th century. In a
span of 20 years he made a total of 17 visits. Not even once he failed.
Every time he went back with tones and tonne of gold snatched from the
public.

When the brilliant ministers  proposed to completely close the kiber pass by
building a strong wall, all the people should have contributed immediately
and should have completed it .

unlike the thousands of kilometer length of the great wall of china, this
wall needed to be just a few kilometres long . The money and effort needed
to build the wall was not even point  one percent of what was lost for not
contributing the construction of the wall.

The morel of the story : Contribute for the right common cause.
( btw this is not a story.
this is a recorded history of india)

So, both for Foss development and tax payment, after understanding
the dangers to him on non - contribution , one has look for tangible
benefits of his contribution to himself and others, and then contribute
developing the project.

Invite opinions in academic interest :-)

Why most of the projects are aimed at Command Line Tools ?.Except geeks, who
else are using Console to work ?. I would suggest working on both
alternatives, Command Line tool and Graphical Tool, which I think is a good
safe approach.Sticking either with CLI or GUI is not good.

Is sendmail not able to  do the above stuffs?

So, what about Damn Small Linux , Puppy Linux , Elive  ?

How far this differ from Gaim & Kopete & Jabber ?

8) Develop a stripped down version of mplayer for playing videos and songs.


???? Whats the use ???? There are many other good alternatives also
available.

What about Prozilla , DownloaderX ? . Arent you able to do the same job ?

I see, at many places, there is nothing but, recreating the wheel. Instead,
the student can join the respective Community and go on with it.

I would suggest projects related to Desktop Enhancements are the most
important today to make GNU/Linux more effective in the Market.

So, WE engineers arent good enough ?. I cannot agree to this kinda
statement. Out of my 5 years of study, I have only 3 or 4 professors who
have been good and all the rest (may be 30) , not of use at all.

I want you to justify your statement. Complaining is very simple. Anybody
can complain.

sendmail is not a pop server or an imap server. It is a mail transfer
agent - mta.  If you're supposed to be part of a team dveloping a distro
I'd expect you to know at least that much...

For a lovely commandline email client that does this, check "heirloom
mailx" (originally called "nail") - http://nail.sourceforge.net

Who said we have plenty of good Professors. A handful of good professors can
create a great number of good engineers. If the professor can influence the
students well, he can mold them into anything. A good professor who has the
ability to influence the students would definitely mold them into good
engineers.

hmm..

You need to rebuild the squidguard database. Read its documentation to
figure out how.

Me and Raja seem to be on the same wavelength when it comes to hearing
to podcasts.

About the talk above , beware listening to that made me rethink my

According to you 10 percent of the professors / lecturers were good.
Can you claim that 25% of the students are good enough engineers ? If
we start comparing the salaries / facilities / hardships, can I say
that the output from "We engineers" is not good enough.

I am by training a physicist and researcher (theoretical, that too!!),
and I am least interested in judging anybody, leave alone engineers.
But it is a fact that many of the  present day engineers think that
they do not need any of the basics. Unfortunately, that is not the
case. As a physicist, I could produce an idea which can be used by
other physicists and, yes, engineers. However, an engineer has to
create things which are used by "lay" people -- the mantra of
"user-friendliness". Hence more responsibility and more creativity --
and naturally more complaints / criticisms.

Heh., I read the archives and well., I'm quite confused about his claim
on 'Experience in software industry'.

Mr.Girish.,

FYI., Andrew S Tanenbaum., is an Engineer. Not just for his degrees and
PhDs but for the knowledge and command he has in his field. He is one of
the few people who can comment on advanced operating system concepts
which current day OSes dont even have a clue about.

Giving derogatory remarks about such a respected person reflects poorly
on you. Please do your research before issuing comments like this on a
mailing list.

And., Linus is NOT god. Just because Linus makes a statement it does not
mean it is right. The reason for the success of 'Linux' is not because
it was the most kick ass kernel at the time. But rather because., no
other kernel was complete and Free at that time. It was a timing issue
which sparked interest in the project and the community poured in and
made it a success. If Minix was out Free during that time., Linus would
not have even bothered writing another kernel. And so., because the
Linux kernel became popular it does not mean that Tanenbaum's argument
was wrong. Any person who has a little bit of knowledge in that field
(operating systems) would tell you that.

</quote>

I did not quite understand what you are trying to say here. Are trying
to say that 'Databases', 'Multithreading', etc. are theoretical topics
which are just for the book and not for real world problems? If you are
going to dismiss something like 'Multithreading'., I'm sure you'd not
have bothered to even look into algorithms or data structures.

I can imagine the quality of code minted by so_called_engineers of your
vision.

</quote>

Interesting. Where do you think concepts such as "Multiprogramming
systems", "IPC", "real-time responsive systems", "Object oriented
programming", "Orthogonal persistence", "Reliable systems", "Verifiable
software systems", etc.. come from? You think it dropped out of a
fresh-man's head and got picked by researchers to research on?

Subject: [Ilugc] Mail client on desktop
Message-ID: <44F579C1.2020807@vsnl.com>

I've been using Outlook for a long while. In the line of work I do, a 
good lot of information is part of the mailbag. So much so that mailbag 
size runs  up to 1.5 - 2GB despite cleanup and archiving of all mails 
older than 6 months to a different PST file.

Problems I face:
1. slow startup.
2. pretty slow mail search within Outlook. (thus I use google desktop 
search for mails too)
3. crashes which lead to pst recovery the next time around.
4. hangs.

I've used Linux a lot and have played around, installed and implemented 
mailing systems - mostly server end.

I'd like to know if anyone has attempted running a popular graphical 
mail client like Thunderbird/Evolution on Linux that handles such large 
mail files in a decent manner.

Things that I'd like to get feedback on:
1. ability to strip attachments from mails and maintain them in a 
separate directory with a link from the mail.
2. archiving based on age of mail.

Well, today Companies out there need immidiate solutions and never bothered
whether one is good with basics. For example, anybody can start learning
Python even if he doesnt know C or C++. So, in the Industry, they might ask
for Python and he gets going. Later, he understands that the basic C/C++ is
required and starts learning.

Today, I find, me not taking much time in learning a new language. I learnt
many in no time , and also the basics of that particular language and
others. Its like, Professors HAVE to know everything in regard of the topic
, but /Engineers may not. A Good Enginner is one who can be accoustomed to
any field (in his related parent field) he is put in. Am a Software Engg and
I should not say, I can work only with GNU/Linux Platform. If so, I can be
put down very easily. The same, If i tell, I can work in GNU/Linux and also
in Windows and also in Mac, then my strength increases and I have lots of
oppurtunities.Thats how an Engineer lives.

I do agree that all 25% would not be good engineers, but sure, the good ones
would be more than that 10% of my Professors list.

My personal take is, leave those bad ones and MANY things can be done from
the good ones and thats what is happening in India today.

Its just not that Engineers are bad and Professors are not and vice versa.

And one more thing that stops Students to enter into GNU/Linux carrer, as
far as I have seen is the EXPERIENCE column. Most of the GNU/Linux hackers
would be good at their young age itself and many develop their skills during
their College days/projects.Companies want atleast 2 to 3 years of work
experience in the GN/Linux field and how can these people, eventhough they
might be very good, apply ?. They are ignored just becoz of this. This is
what has to change in India IMO. The EXPERIENCE should be, experience in
that particular field which is being asked , but not WORK.

I've used many web based front ends and Zimbra. This is for desktop 
usage. I could used a Linux desktop with local services like Apache and 
use a web based email connecting to the local server. That is not what 
I'm intending. Front end looks nice. Neat work.

A tangential question - does mojo give you the capability to define and 
use windows under the browser? A while ago, I checked mojo and a few 
others and chose qooxdoo for AJAX work as it did give this facility. May 
be wrong or dated though.

Which version of Outlook are you using? I have a close to 3GB .OST
(equivalent to .PST when using Exchange accounts) and I don't face any
of these problems - but mine is Outlook 2003 Pro though which supports
the UNICODE format OST files (upto 20GB).

Message-ID: <72288b670608301016n2311accbie144c01771485607@mail.gmail.com>

I recently installed Kubuntu Dapper Drake(amd64) on my system (specially
patched for my system http://www.ccsl.carleton.ca/~jamuir/kubuntu )
Everything is fine but I can't hear any sound on my system. I've checked for
obvious hardware problems. Sound is working fine with WinXP on the same
system.
I also happen to have my motherboard support CD which has some "Linux
Drivers" for "sound" etc. Can anyone tell me how to use them? Or possibly
give an alternative solution.

My system's configuration :
AMD Athlon 64-bit 3000+
Asus A8V-MX motherboard
80 Gb SATA HDD


Thanking you in advance,

How are you trying it? What is your hardware? What
infrared device? How is it connected to your hardware?

When you try to send/contact, can you check in
/bin/dmesg output for any relevant messages?

Can you also post output of /sbin/lsmod?

True :)

Can you run alsamixer on the terminal and check your
volume, PCM settings? Make sure they are not muted or
set low.

Open a terminal and post output of the following:

/sbin/lsmod
/bin/lspci
ls -l /dev/dsp

Note, you can redirect output to a file:

/sbin/lsmod > lsmod.txt

(Don't send them as attachments, just paste them
inline and send it - they are useful for debugging).

Ouch. I have always seen people having problems with
it.

Friends.

We constantly do more LDD's, workshops on the name of chennailug,org.
We promote people to visit this site and join in mailing list.

But, see the site as a normal person.

The old data, unselling tshirt ads, very old RMS talks data...

Most guys asked me that wether the LUG is active or not?
Did u stopped working two years ago?

we have a lot of Web Admins here.
Please guys.
We have enough time to write long long mails.
long replies, continous replies, flame wars. rants etc.
But, why none of us have time to keep our site updated.

No need to be updated.
Atleast, remove the old data.

This will make more people to come to us.

Think.

I am ready to do the things, if somebody tell me how to do?

Hi Chakkardeep ,

Well your reply to Girishs suggestions for Projects for students was
just a beginning .

As soon as some one as fresh as in college gets an idea about the
projects , his mind will give him more so that he can find his
specialisation and work on that .

So going by your words that why re-invent the wheel , I would strongly
disagree with you because its not re-inventing the wheel , its finding
their way in the new world FS.

I was about to start a project after going through the mail of Girish
and felt bad after seeing your mail . Its not that motivating , but
good to point out the issues but not create a problem in itself.

Never mind , these are my humble thoughts , maybe my seniors or pro
ILUGC members can share their comments on this too .

I would really appreciate if they can shed their valuable suggestions
. Expecting them :)

Thats it for now ,

Bye
-Deva

Hi Shrini ,

I completely agree with you on this .

Site needs improvement.

The first time I visited the site I thought of it as a non functioning
site only 'coz it contained MoM till 2004 , but the page proudly
boasted of having each and every meeting minuted properly .

Well our admin fellas , pls give it a fresh and new life .

Cheerz

Good list of projects. But if Mr. Girish had attended a project review at
any computer science dept(as he calls it a list of computer science
projects) with any one of these projects he would have seen what you call
getting screwed up. All the projects are already done and well documented.
All that the student needs to do is follow the docs and get the project
ready. This curbs the innovation that each college expects its students to
do. Anyone can argue that a good student can show innovation even in this
set of projects. But to do any of these projects, does anyone need to do
Computer Science Engg? May be thats my opinion.

My idea was to join those existing projects, and work along with them. Best
part of GNU/Linux is working with the Community.

When I first tried out Dapper Drake Beta, 3 months ago, I had similar 
problem with sound. I was able to hear at most some sound with a loud 
buzz accompanying the sound. But, when Aanjhan and I were trying things 
out, suddenly it too stopped. We checked at bugzilla and found it was a 
known issue with Lenovo Laptop and but the bug was fortunately fixed in 
the later releases of the kernel from Ubuntu. I then updated my kernel 
for 2.6.15.23 to 2.6.15.25, which got me sound in the headphone but 
still my speakers were dead. I survived with this for a couple of weeks, 
when I updated to 2.6.15.26. After updating, I booted on my computer and 
  surprisingly I was able to hear the login music. Everything got right.

As shakthi said, first check your alsamixer output, especially for the 
PCM value. Generally, it is off by default. It has happened to me 
sometime, when I do some update/install of sound related plugin that PCM 
goes to 'MM' from 'OO'. If I turn it back to 'OO', the sound comes again :)

If this doesn't work, check out bugzilla for any known issues for your 
soundcard and any fixes are offered. If not bugs are found, then create 
a new one and wait for the community to come to your help ;)

Dev,

Sorry that you got demotivated. LUG is always a place where people from 
various backgrounds and ideologies come together, with a similar 
interest rather than calling it single interest. We differ in our 
principles, thoughts, ideologies, philosophies and the way we interpret 
things. So, the chance of flame wars is too high and till now flame wars 
has been an occasional entertainer to many of the luggies. Note 
entertainer doesn't mean that this is for fun, it means we take in a 
positive sense.

LUG is a common place where we share our views and when doing so, 
clashes of interest and ideas do occur. It should be taken in the 
healthy sense, and it has been so far. Otherwise ilugc wouldn't be as 
active as it is now. :)

As far as your motivation is considered, I (though am not a guru or 
expert in any sense, but just an active physical contributor to ilugc) 
will tell you one single advice - Hear what 1000 people say, but do what 
your heart says. Criticism will always haunt you at every part of your 
life, you will hear things which will make you feel the world to be 
ugly, but still if your heart says you can do something then just do it. 
Don't think about the end result, don't get turned down by criticism and 
initial failures. Just keep doing what you feel doing, provided it 
doesn't affect others negatively. Its better to learn by making mistakes 
than being all the way conscious of making none. Every successful man's 
career starts by doing something which they themselves call as "mistake 
I did in my life" and its nothing wrong in doing it.

so, if you are thinking of doing a project just do it and see. Don't 
keep thinking whether it will come out well or not. Trying out is always 
better than thinking out, especially with software ;)

How many of the so-called college students do innovative projects 
otherwise ?? maybe a 10% ?! And, why people always mean final year 
projects when it comes to the term "doing projects" ? what about the 
earlier 7 semesters ? Do you think that the student is not technically 
mature and capable of doing a projects in the earlier 7 semesters and 
suddenly out of nowhere does one "innovative" project on the last 
semester, when he is already placed in some XYZ company and has no 
further interest in putting up a best performance in the last term ?
If your answer is yes, then he is not a Professional at all and his 4 
years of professional educations attains no meaning.

Its not that students are so much engaged during their earlier 7 
semesters. But, I will agree that they had not been given much exposure 
to the opportunities. Most students realize the importance of doing 
projects, only at the end or after the graduation (am myself one 
example, but thankfully I had interest to learn something). That's what 
ilugc is trying to do, give some exposure to students by introducing 
them to FLOSS, taking up seminars, making them participate in LDDs.

We can only take the horse to the pond, drinking water or not remains 
with the horse and we can't force it ;)

I would like to give you my own experiences.

I decided to do a Collaborative Tool as my last semester project and the
project was associated with ISRO. Now, Collaborative Tool is a tool which
would have Video Conferencing(audio&video),Application
Sharing,Whiteboard,Text Chat etc., in one application.

Now,how did we start off ?. We knew very well, the first part - Video
Conferencing can be easily achieved by VLC(Video Lan Client) and modifying
the GUI of VLC should help us a lot.And for others, we got separate
application, made VLC GUI as the main Interface and integrated eveything
with few little tweaks and fixes to fit in our needs.Ofcourse, it was not
that easy and understanding the working of VLC Gui and functions was a major
task and yes, VLC Community did help us.

If I had not chosen VLC and started off from the ground , by writing my own
codecs,drivers for all webcams....do you think thats a viable solution ?

Another example is with my Yoper Installer. As everybody would do, I started
this Yoper Installer (YIS) from scratch. I was very proud to start from
scratch, but was I able to give a good installer till today?. NO.There is a
basic version of the installer available but it wouldnt be that great. I
knew where my mistake was. I tried recreating the stuffs what already others
have done. Then, I tried looking around Anaconda installer,Mandrake
installer,Freespire installer,PCLinuxOS installer,Mepis Installer. I would
be coming up with what installer to use for Yoper very soon.Now, the job is
easier and also it wouldnt take much time to comply the original installer
to fit into Yoper needs.

Still, another example is, I always wanted to create a simple,yet effective
desktop distro. I had my own ideas and thoughts which I had not seen in any
distro. I started off with , Ok- I will create my own distro!. When I saw
about Freespire and Linspire, I saw everything that I thought was already
being implemented and without hesitating I joined Freespire and Linspire and
today I work with them too.

I think I was clear on actually what is "re-inventing the wheel". And
students should choose innovative and creative projects and I would
reccommend projects which would add extra functionalities to the existing
ones or totally a new one.

I've used many web based front ends and Zimbra. This is for desktop 
usage. I could used a Linux desktop with local services like Apache and 
use a web based email connecting to the local server. That is not what 
I'm intending. Front end looks nice. Neat work.

A tangential question - does mojo give you the capability to define and 
use windows under the browser? A while ago, I checked mojo and a few 
others and chose qooxdoo for AJAX work as it did give this facility. May 
be wrong or dated though.

Which version of Outlook are you using? I have a close to 3GB .OST
(equivalent to .PST when using Exchange accounts) and I don't face any
of these problems - but mine is Outlook 2003 Pro though which supports
the UNICODE format OST files (upto 20GB).

I recently installed Kubuntu Dapper Drake(amd64) on my system (specially
patched for my system http://www.ccsl.carleton.ca/~jamuir/kubuntu )
Everything is fine but I can't hear any sound on my system. I've checked for
obvious hardware problems. Sound is working fine with WinXP on the same
system.
I also happen to have my motherboard support CD which has some "Linux
Drivers" for "sound" etc. Can anyone tell me how to use them? Or possibly
give an alternative solution.

My system's configuration :
AMD Athlon 64-bit 3000+
Asus A8V-MX motherboard
80 Gb SATA HDD

How are you trying it? What is your hardware? What
infrared device? How is it connected to your hardware?

When you try to send/contact, can you check in
/bin/dmesg output for any relevant messages?

Can you also post output of /sbin/lsmod?

Can you run alsamixer on the terminal and check your
volume, PCM settings? Make sure they are not muted or
set low.

Open a terminal and post output of the following:

/sbin/lsmod
/bin/lspci
ls -l /dev/dsp

Note, you can redirect output to a file:

/sbin/lsmod > lsmod.txt

(Don't send them as attachments, just paste them
inline and send it - they are useful for debugging).

Ouch. I have always seen people having problems with

Friends.

We constantly do more LDD's, workshops on the name of chennailug,org.
We promote people to visit this site and join in mailing list.

But, see the site as a normal person.

The old data, unselling tshirt ads, very old RMS talks data...

Most guys asked me that wether the LUG is active or not?
Did u stopped working two years ago?

we have a lot of Web Admins here.
Please guys.
We have enough time to write long long mails.
long replies, continous replies, flame wars. rants etc.
But, why none of us have time to keep our site updated.

No need to be updated.
Atleast, remove the old data.

This will make more people to come to us.

Think.

I am ready to do the things, if somebody tell me how to do?

regards,
T.Shrinivasan.

Hi Chakkardeep ,

Well your reply to Girishs suggestions for Projects for students was
just a beginning .

As soon as some one as fresh as in college gets an idea about the
projects , his mind will give him more so that he can find his
specialisation and work on that .

So going by your words that why re-invent the wheel , I would strongly
disagree with you because its not re-inventing the wheel , its finding
their way in the new world FS.

I was about to start a project after going through the mail of Girish
and felt bad after seeing your mail . Its not that motivating , but
good to point out the issues but not create a problem in itself.

Never mind , these are my humble thoughts , maybe my seniors or pro
ILUGC members can share their comments on this too .

I would really appreciate if they can shed their valuable suggestions
. Expecting them :)

Thats it for now ,

Bye
-Deva

Hi all,

For my projects i have to decide on a lcd display which sizes 6 inches x 6.2
inches. When i googled i found that the size is uncommon.
I am going to run an application built using gtk/FB. I prefer reference
display driver code available for the chosen LCD display.

Anyone has idea of any such board? Please share with me.

Subject: [Ilugc] Regarding projects for engineers
Message-ID: <1192.61.247.255.57.1157003964.squirrel@www.songbirdtech.com>

I have been reading Girish's emails and the many responses from different
quarters with much interest.

Girish raises some interesting points which must not be overlooked just
because many dispute his comments about Tanenbaum - I am referring to his
comments that Tanenbaum is a researcher and not an engineer.

I think I see what Girish is trying to say here - correct me if I am
wrong, but I think his assertion was that there are many people in India
with the theoretical knowledge but very few with applied skills and
knowledge. I must say that I am in complete agreement with Girish on this.

The indian education system is geared towards making it very difficult to
get an entry into the educational institution, but it makes the process of
passing out of the institution with a degree/other-qualification
remarkably simple even if one doesn't have the requisite skills.

That is, it is difficult to enroll as a student in a higher education
system (eg: an engineering college), but once you are in, you can walk out
with a degree (even if it is a degree in a professional, applied field)
quite easily without having any of the required skills.

Letting all and sundry get these qualifications just because they managed
to get their feet in through the door is particularly dangerous in the
case of professional disciplines and courses. Someone who claims to be a
civil engineer may have no idea as to how to go about constructing a
building even though he has a degree which indicates that he does.

I personally feel that it should be the other way around - it should be
simple enough to get an entry into most institutions, but only the most
talented, and the skilled should be allowed to walk away with a degree.

Some systems even in India work this way already - for instance, the
Association of Chartered Accountants has strict rules for determining who
is allowed to pass with a certification and they will allow only a small
percentage of people to pass every year.

Another thing which I particularly like about the CA system is that it
mandates that all applicants go through a system of apprenticeship for a
period of 3 year (I think) before they can apply for taking the CA final
exam - and I can definitely say that an accountant with 3 years of
experience working under other accountants in a professional capacity will
really know his stuff rather more than an engineering student will know
engineering at the end of 3 years of study.

The association of chartered accountants wants to ensure that they don't
have someone bearing their certification who will bring their organization
disrepute. They ensure this by making sure that only the most deserving
get it. Sadly, this is missing in other organizations across the country.

(NOTE: I am not referring to the ethical standards of CAs. That is a
different discussion altogether. I am referring to just applied skills
here)

I think the standards of engineering will improve drastically if a similar
system of apprenticeships and very-difficult-to-pass examinations and
mandatory tightly-controlled-and-assessed project system is put in place.

There are just too many people who walk around with engineering degrees
who frankly don't deserve it. I think many of them are guilty of
misrepresentation and misleading the public when they claim to be
engineers/doctors when they just don't know the subject. Its like putting
a "100% Fat Free" sticker on a slab of cheese.

<SHOCKING-BUT-TRUE-ANECDOTE-WARNING>
I interviewed a "Electronics Engineer" a few months ago here in Chennai.
He was a recent graduate and was working elsewhere for a few months. I
asked him to explain the benefits of a NAND Gate. To my shock, he replied
that he didn't know what a NAND Gate is! Only thing worse is a doctor not
knowing what a blood cell/virus/bacteria is! How was this guy allowed to
walk out with an engineering degree?!
</SHOCKING-BUT-TRUE-ANECDOTE-WARNING>

<SHOCKING-BUT-TRUE-ANECDOTE-WARNING>
A highly experience chemical engineer I know told me how he has problems
finding chemical engineers these days with enough skills to atleast
balance an equation.
</SHOCKING-BUT-TRUE-ANECDOTE-WARNING>

Our education system for professional disciplines is a mess - it stresses
theory and does not stress applied skills nearly as much as it should.

I can safely wager that there are many engineers (I am referring to the
electrical/electronics engineers here) even from the premier engineering
schools of this country who cannot assemble even a door bell by themselves
if their lives depended on it.

Thank you and regards,
PK

Message-ID: <7bf1bec50608302300x39c9c528ndfe4456455228cef@mail.gmail.com>

Seems to be high season for project ideas :-) . Here's one from me:

An open source implementation of a solution to the dynamic job shop
scheduling problem (DJSSP). Don't be misled into thinking this only applies
to production planning in manufacturing industries. Thats the classical case
for which much research has been done (surprisingly most research only
covers the JSSP - a 'D" before that is considered one of the hardest of NP
hard problems). Modern applications for this will be BPOs (eg. allocating
froms to be processed to people). It applies to any situation where a set of
jobs are to be allocated to a finite set of resources.

Since it is an NP hard problem, there is no point in trying to find the most
optimal solution. Instead, the focus is to find good enough 'feasible'
solutions. The prevailing view is that genetic algorithms are well suited
for these kinds of problems. There are a few articles about this on the web
but no implementations. So, if you can do this, it can get you academic,
industry as well as hacker recognition.

You have broken your exim4 config - either by hand editing it or by some
mistake you did with debconf

If you are using the debian configuration there's a mailing list for the
debian exim4 package, ask on that

Or else ask on exim-users@exim.org

Post the relevant section of the exim4.conf file

I use a similar board without the TFT.

I started a small program 3 years ago and have been pretty successful.
Identify an worthy apprentice and train one-on-one for about a year.
Aim for excellence, and teach the apprentice everything you know.  So
far, I've "trained" 4 people and they have now found bigger and better
opportunities else where (some of them may be lurking on this list).

Hopefully, your apprentice will imbibe the same culture and start
training others in the same fashion.  If you've seen the movie
"Pay it Forward", you'll understand the philosophy.

Kudos for your effort. Can't we have the URL for chennailug.org there ?

I want your suggestion on good web hosting provider for my personal site.
The requirement is,
1. atleast 20MB
2. Linux based
3. Wordpress support (if any one has installed wordpress on this hosting, it
is well and good)
4. around Rs.1000/- per year only :-)

Hey,

The design is simple yet cool. It has retained its old flavor but also 
is a bit attractive (not sure whether its because of my glossy laptop 
display ;) ). Hope we can make use of the same template for the original 
site too :)

Great to hear that you are doing something like that. It is perhaps the
best way to impart skills - the old gurukul system primarily worked that
way where a senior person with experience and skill taught younger
aspirants the skills. No education system can beat the one you have
described.

In this modern age with the vast numbers of students, we will perhaps need
a more formalized system which perhaps doesn't work as well as the
one-on-one system you are using at present - but nonetheless, one which is
better than the current system. CA is an example of such a system - you
will rarely find a CA who doesn't know his job.

I believe firmly that engineering students must start working in
engineering companies in core engineering jobs starting from perhaps the
third semester (2nd year) and attend classes in the evenings. It won't be
easy working on the shop floor for 3 years straight; and this will keep
out those "engineers" who are there for the glamour but want none of the
hands-on toil. At the end of 3 years, these students will have a far
better grasp of the subject and also an understanding of what
specialization interests them. Also, the experience will go a long way in
making them suitable for employment.

IMHO, the "Site powered by" message and the images could be taken some
where and not placed at the right side of the page.

the template is just a mock up. and while the real conten could be any where.
i suggest drupal / wiki could work really for chennailug.org. i have
asked so many times about the revamp. but i am unlucky to get it.

I recommend dreamhost.com and 1and1.com.  Check their website for
plans/features.  But I don't think they offer Rs. 1000/pa plans
and would end up being a bit more expensive.

Hi.

Looks nice.

But, there are a lot of templates available
in www.oswd.org and like sites.

Content is important in our site.
We need to maintain the content dynamic and current.

any simple cms may be enough.

or else, just HTML pages telling about linux,
LUGS aroung world, chennailug, etc
is enough.

In worst case, please remove the old outdated information.
that itself do a lot.

regards,
T.shrinivasan.

You wont express exactly what you *feel deep inside*, but we should be able
to assume everything in the positive sense, even if it sounds negative.

What is your network setup? Which ISP? Are you using
an ethernet modem or USB-modem?

What is the problem? You probably might missing the
mp3 plugin or your sound is set low. 

Also, let us know of your system specification.
