What exactly you want and what is our problem in configuring sybase 
replication.

Here is a clue there are two types of replication systems available in 
sybase one is the one comes with sybase and other other you will need to 
purchase from Sybase itself.

The one that is available is not a real time sybase replication

hi,

i'm an engineering student. i've been using linux for the past two years. i'm in the final year. i have an idea... i have a CD writer and i'm planning to write Linux CDs and give them for very cheap price (i haven't decided on the price yet - plz suggest). Linux being free, i don't see how GTCDROM and other resellers sell it for 200 rupees. it will take them max 50 rupees per CD (including all costs)....

plz mail me your comments, good or bad - they'll be invaluable. i have almost all distributions... will there be a market if i write and sell the CDs?

plz take a moment to reply me. if possible, plz FWD my mail to your friends.

thanks and regards,

              ^^^^^

As  an engineering  student doing  finals,  it is  important that  you
interpret things correctly.  You should  know that Linux is the kernel
of  the  greater  system  called  as  GNU.  In  Kerala,  most  of  the
engineering students (there are some  listers here) call the system as
GNU/Linux.  The  GNU tools comprise  the major portion and  the kernel
only a  minor but important  18 %  and now you  may ask, I  never knew
about this ?  Please link up and read http://www.gnu.org.in/ for more.

I had come to IIT-Chennai about  5 years back and nobody told me about
the GNU  Project, not  even guys closely  associated with  this kernel
user group, ILUG-Chennai.  This should not happen to you......


>> I have  an idea...  i  have a CD  writer and i'm planning  to write
>> Linux CDs and give them for very cheap price

Do that and you are free to  make and sell copies.  Some of us here in
Kerala have been doing just this,  selling GNU/Linux CDs for as low as
Rs  20/-.  The  Model Engineering  College guys  are busy  this moment
burning  a set  of GNU  CDs, they  are also  making some  cash  in the
bargain and also helping spread the message of the GNU.  Mind you they
are also  learning because the  GNU GPL has  allowed them to  view the
source  code of  the kernel  Linux, the  compiler GCC  and  many other
programs that comprise the GNU system..... 

PS.  Do not forget to sign up as a volunteer at the gnu.org.in site.

Most probably because no one knew -- not out of malice or ill will.
Also, I'm not sure Stallman moved into "advertise GNU" mode at the
time.  Atleast we never heard much noise about it.  **To me** it seems
its only now that much noise is being made about calling it GNU/Linux.

    RB> with this kernel user group, ILUG-Chennai.  This should not
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You clearly have no idea of what you are talking about.  It also
appears that for some, any amount of explaining what ILUGC stands for
is meaningless.  Anyway I'll give it another shot.

ILUGC is *not* a kernel user group.  People have mentioned the Hurd
which has nothing to do with the Linux kernel.  There have been demo's
on BSD.  And so far there haven't been any serious talks on the Linux
kernel -- except maybe how to compile a Linux kernel.  That certainly
does not allow you to call this a kernel user group.  ILUGC is a name.
Like most names its not perfect and does not necessarily spell out
what we do.  Its like the Free Software Foundation.  The meaning of
free there is misleading.  However this doesn't mean that we say the
FSF promotes the use of public domain or BSD software, do we?  So in
truth FSF should be called GSF (for GPL Software Foundation) If this
is true for FSF, why is it wrong for ILUGC to be imperfect in its
name?

Of course, the GNU project is a truly great effort and many folks
(obviously including the FSF) have contributed to make it something
great.  We all appreciate that.  Calling the various distros GNU/Linux
is ok with me -- I myself do it often but changing ILUGC's name is a
pain, and of not much use.

cheers,
prabhu

I was commenting on Roopa's post  of selling GNU/Linux CDs.  No, I was
not requesting anyone  to change ILUGC's name.  You  are posting as if
`the pot calling the kettle black'.

Now that you have raised this issue, permit me to clarify things a wee
bit.  What is Linux ?  Linux is a kernel, a kernel by itself cannot be
an OS.  What is ILUGC ?  ILUGC is the Indian Linux (kernel) User Group
of Chennai.  ILUGC == Indian Kernel User Group, Chennai Chapter. ;-)

If people do  not want to be  free, nobody can help them.   It is said
that if  one does not  yearn for freedom,  they are cursed to  live in
chains for all Eternity. :(

On Debian GNU/Linux you can use pppconfig. pretty nifty. Alternatively
you can also use wvdial.

On Redhat you have "kppp", its simple to setup and connect to the

Hope this helps.

LOL.

Sure, and FSF == Free Software Foundation.  Therefore by your own
logic the FSF actively supports BSD and public domain licensed
software.  Even shareware software is supported, its 'free' afterall!
Whats the fuss with all this GPL and stuff? :)

I've a P4 machine with a ASUS V6600 (Nvidia 256/32MB) graphics card on a
triple boot Win98/Win2000/ Linux and a Logitech PS/2 wheel mouse. I go
over to Linux from DOS using loadlin. I've loaded RH7.3.

My graphics card is detected correctly and am able to set all the
resolutions, colour depth etc. In the graphics mode, I'm not able to see
my cursor pointer! Mouse movement is tracked as Buttons pop up on
mouseover and get selected. Gpm is running and XF86Config-4 - the
startup X config file used has PS/2 protocol and mouse as corepointer
too.

Any pointers (pardon the pun) -:).

In some cases, I've problems in X running if Linux is started thro'
loadlin - maybe loadlin is not able to offload all payload from memory.
This happened on a Savage S3 card machine. Startx would report a X
server crash. However fresh boot from Linux would go thro' perfectly.

TIA
Bye
Mohan

The OS is called GNU. Linux is one of the kernels that GNU can use.
Please call the system as GNU/Linux.

Bus Mice have a 'single-open' limitation which prevents you from using
both GPM and the X Window System at the same time. To over come this you
have to setup gpm as a repeater. My PS2 mouse has the same problem that
you have mentioned and this is what is in my gpm.conf:

**
#  /etc/gpm.conf - configuration file for gpm(1)
#
device=/dev/psaux
responsiveness=
repeat_type=
type=imps2
append=" -R ps2"
sample_rate=
**

Also you have to make XF86 use /dev/gpmdata as its pointer Device
instead of /dev/psaux.

I have an USB Mouse and it works just fine without extra config on a
RedHat box. 

OTOH, the touch pad on my laptop refuses to work. I have no clues
whatsoever to get it to work. Can somebody help ?

May I ask you the make and model of your Laptop ?  Certain touch pads
have `non-free' drivers but they can be made to work.

btw, have you Googled ?

duh? maybe, only some ps/2 mice have this issue? or maybe, with some
graphics cards? my compaq machine has a compaq ps/2 mouse (which says
logitech on the back) and i dont even have a gpm.conf. i am living happily
with both gpm and X. my /dev/mouse points to /dev/psaux and /dev/psaux is

If I try to live by all the proverbs, aphorisms and sayings
that can be thrown at me I will be a sorry person indeed.

It appears to me that many advocates of freedom are often close to violating
my freedom by calling me and my attitude names.

I hope ILUGC stands for freedom rather than some
people's idea of it.

Debate is definitely part f that freedom and having my
beliefs and attitudes questioned is part of that freedom too.
But labelling my attitude is not.

I've loaded RHL many times over on so many different machines that I've lost
count. I've never had a problem with X except in 1MB VGA machines where the
probe does not recognise the card. When it came to my personal machine,
Murphy's law took over.

I forgot to mention in my previous mail that I killed gpm and still the
pointer is elusive. I guess it would then not be a function of gpm.

Another luggie had said he had problems with touch pads. On Toshiba
notebooks, it works well on standard install - have had no problems.

Is there an issue of pointer image being generated by the graphics card in
such high end cards? I'd hate to downgrade it to standard VGA to see if this
works - what a compromise?

I've been following this thread and the one on name change which evoked a
lot of emotion packed mails etc. While I do agree that we can express our
views freely in a group like this, making them personal and remarks about
attitudes do not augur well for the maturity of the group.

If we could avoid such mails or reactions consciously, I guess this will die
down automatically. This is my request to all members to ensure that
constructive ideas get exchanged and members do not exit the group based on
such occurances. Moreover, new members may be misled about the coherence of
the group if they see such mails within days of joining the group.

Hi Luggies,

  If you have already replied to this mail earlier, just ignore
this mail.

   It's high time that you start sending mails to me about your
choice of designs. The voting system will not be used anymore.
This is because there was a sudden increase in the no:of votes
registered for the first design on Saturday. I just had a little
chat with Suraj about this and we decided to send mail to the 
list
and get the votes for the design this way. By doing this it will
help us to know about the exact requirements. Please furnish the
following details.

  Tshirt Designs  Your Choice(Y/N)  No:of T-shirts Needed

  You can even go in for multiple designs. In that case 2 or 
more

reaches 90 or so.

Just reply to this mail giving all the details which will get

well, you can read all this stuff and much more, which i will describe as
"the world according to richard stallman". dont get me wrong, stallman is
very very good and i admire him for many things; however, i also disagree
with several of his ideas. gnu started with the stated objective of "The
GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like operating
system which is free software". some of us have been using commercial unix
since those days (well, there are many who have been using for longer, but
i dont think there are any of those on this list). gnu has been delivering
many wonderful tools, but can anyone show me where is the gnu os?  ahh,
you need the minor but important kernel, eh? after a few years, many gnu
watchers gave up and believed that gnu would deliver only tools which you
could use on your proprietary aix/hpux/irix/whatever box.  interesting
twist to the stated aim, isn't that? then linux comes along and coupled
with cheap intel/amd/whatever hardware, linux suddenly becomes a global
rage. of course, linux depends on gnu stuff. so, gnu folks feel slighted
by the name linux and would like to enjoy some of the fame by insisting on 
gnu/linux. arguments like "the kernel is only 18%" are difficult to 
accept. many people would not consider using linux without X. now, what % 
share would you allot for X? how do you count this % anyway? source code 
size (man, X would score heavily here)? binary size? well, if you want to 
insist on gnu/linux, would you at least extend the same courtesy to X? 
ahh, i see, someone else has to pick up that fight, eh? very nice, i say.

I request all of you to give MDK9.0 a try and feedback
on the tamil support. Just choose Tamil as your

Hi,
	Nice to see that mandrake cds are finally here. As i do not have access to 
high speed internet is it possible for someone to burn a copy of mdk 9.0 for 
me.
Thanks

Oh wait...

Ask any student of Computing Science and you will hear "an OS is one
that manages the hardware resources", or something to that effect.  I
did not do particularly well in the OS course that I took, but I
certainly do not remember any discussion of pine, vi, Apache, or
binutils.  You pick up any classic on Operating Systems and you will
not find a description of Emacs or ls or find.  You will find process
mgmt, file systems, IPC.  Whatever the importance of these utilities,
they certainly do not form part of the OS...

Sigh.  I guess this is what happens when hobbyists outnumber the pros
;) ;)

If the GNU folks wanted a  short-cut to fame, they would have insisted
on calling the  kernel as Stallmanix (in the  US) and maybe Krishmanix
(in India).  Can you deny credit where it is due ?

The hobby kernel by Linux Torvalds is a very crucial component and now
we have  a fully free Operating  System called as  GNU/Linux.  Maybe a
better free kernel (micro/mu-micro) may replace it. 

The GNU folks are slighted only  when they see that the greater ideals
of sharing  and community  being trampled on  and forgotten.   The GNU
folks  are concerned only  because they  see *gullible*  newbies taken
down  a path of  no-return, the  endless blackhole  to which  they are
slipping and falling down when they unknowingly use `non-free' stuff.

calling the kernel as stallmanix or krishmanix would also be known as
plaigarism. if the objective of gnu is so noble and only to ensure credit 
where it is due, why not also propose to have X somewhere in the name? at 
least, one cannot then accuse gnu of being selfish in trying to promote 
its own name (only) and will give a righteous ring to the affair. gnu can 
get visibility without having to tag on to linux. linux would not be 
possible without gnu. a subtle effort to make this point could have been 
done ...

non-free stuff like other open sourced software? or non-free stuff as in 
proprietary stuff like what is put out by microsoft? or are all these 
considered the same?

Subtle efforts should not be resorted to choke the message of freedom.
People would later call us *pretenders* and we would have lost time by
then.  People who  are in positions of influence,  should never resort
to such subtle tactics.  I would not do that !

Ever since the beginning of other threads on this list there has been a
confusion about what this 'non-free' refers to and it lead to a few
flamestarters. 

What was meant by non-free was software that is NOT 'free' as defined by
the free software foundation. A software is considered to be free when
it gives:

  0. The freedom to use the software for any purpose
  1. the freedom to study the source code
  2. the freedom to modify
  3. the freedom to redistribute the source code

so any software that denies one of the above freedoms is considered
non-free. a few examples that I can think of: JDK is non-free. Opera is
non-free too. Apache is Free. X is free. Linux is free. GLIBC is free.
GNU make is free. open source softwares that give these freedoms are free too.
The only difference is that the OSS world talks of technical superiority
and cost-effectiveness, which can be easily defeated (and has already
been defeated in most arenas) by proprietary softwares. When one tells
some one to start using 'open source' softwares because they are
technically good, ppl always end up being disappointed. They always come up
with 'look.. this <free alternative> sucks. I cant do <foo>! I cant open
my .<bar format> files'.

Suraj, dont you mean otherwise ? I think OSS will beat proprietary
eventually. Look at the amount of proprietary code gone open (AFS,

Your premise  of OSS  beating the proprietary  guys is flawed.   If we
mount an  attack on the  proprietary guys on technical  excellence, we
stand to lose.  Anyday, the  proprietary guys are better and they have
the power of the greenbacks to  achieve this.  They can easily out gun
us,  particularly small  time  guys  in Chennai  and  India.  This  is
happening in Kerala.

The OSM  says that everything is  about cost, the  cheaper the better!
If the  OSM goes on like  this a day  is not far off,  when developers
have to eat dirt and stones.  :(

Most of the  licenses of the OSI have got  problems.  The developer is
not protected  and defended for.  How  can you further  freedom if you
are not  able to defend ?   Only the GNU  GPL has got ammo  to protect
both the developer and the end-user freedoms.

I found the answer to this question ... finally.

The trick was to set TERM=dtterm after sshing over.  It turns out that
by default dtterm is the one that delivers colors on Solaris, not
xterm or xterm-color.

hi,

thanx a lottttt for the replies...(for my posting "Linux CDs")

first i'd like to apologize for not calling GNU/Linux by its proper name - calling it as Linux is more of laziness than lack of acknowledgement of GNU's contribution. if everybody knows that Linux = GNU + Linux kernel, then we can stop calling it GNU/Linux.  we can call Linux kernel as Linux kernel and GNU softwares+Linux kernel as Linux; instead of asking everybody to call it GNU/Linux. But Stallman wudn't like it :-) but we clamor for freedom of thought... so i think we can 'freely' call it by any name :-)) .... please mail me your thoughts and opinions ....

yes, definitely, without GNU, Linux would have remained just an excellent student project. 

one small thought on all this. (dunno if it is right.... plz don't bomb my mailbox....). Without the contributions of innumerable scientists who lived and died before Einstein, Einstein would have achieved nothing. He wud have been forced to discover everything from structure of atom to gravity to everything first, before he can even think about quantum physics or relativity or whatever. he wudn't even have had pen and paper to write his theory. but do we call it as: 
"kepler/galileo/newton/jim/carry/.../mom/dad/bohr/einstein's theory of relativity"? 

i didn't mean to be rude... hope you get the point though... plz tell me what u think.

i went home for a few days (coz of gandhi-jayanthi etc)... so i cudn't reply the mails that i got from the members of this group (the mails that i got directly). i'm sorry - i'll reply soon. thanx a lot to everybody....

He wud have been forced to discover everything from structure of atom to gravity to everything first, before he can even think about quantum physics or relativity or whatever. he wudn't even have had pen and paper to write his theory. but do we call it as: <BR>"kepler/galileo/newton/jim/carry/.../mom/dad/bohr/einstein's theory of relativity"? </P>
<P>i didn't mean to be rude... hope you get the point though... plz tell me what u think.</P>
<P>i went home for a few days (coz of gandhi-jayanthi etc)... so i cudn't reply the mails that i got from the members of this group (the mails that i got directly). i'm sorry - i'll reply soon. thanx a lot to everybody....</P>

I don't think you need to apologize for calling Linux.

As rightly pointed by Dr.Sriram,Prabhu and Karra there
is nothing wrong calling linux as linux or gnu/linux.

I don't understand why this 'gnu shouting brigade'
insists on prefixing gnu when all important 18%
kernel, most important X [may be 50%?] and strategic
TCP/IP [may be 20%] and the very basic language C
[what percent left ?] are not from stables of GNU.

  Incidentally, I would like to pointout that GPL
never requires you to recognise the original
authors(s} of a software, when you modify, not even a
reference to the original author. You can take a gnu
software distribute it is as yours without revealing
the source, all that is required is to give the
receiver all the 4 rights.

  I don't understand why they insist on gnu prefixing
as a precondition when nothing of the sort is done in
their licensing terms.

  The cause of freedom will not be advanced by
discouraging people on naming conventions. The real
greatness of freedom lies in software beeing freely
used.

Hi,

I just found that said dtterm trick does not always work - it's only a
q&d h, and that there is a correct and "better" solution.

It is this:  suppose xterm is the terminal emulator on the local linux
box one is using

(a) create a directory ~/.terminfo/x on the remote solaris box.
(b) copy the /usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm file from local linux box to
    ~/.terminfo/x/xterm on the remote box.
(c) Do a export TERMINFO=~/.terminfo on remote.
(d) Start Emacs21 

And there!  it is a pretty colorful world.

I would like to quote that kicha and praveen kannan (who work at
slashsupport and occasionally moonlight at our meets) had made a private
post to *me* asking me to help make SlashSupport a venue for the meets.
I had asked him to post directly to the list so that people on the list
would know that I am *NOT* giving my seal of approval for SlashSupport.

So far ILUGC has never had a venue that could accomodate 40 ppl. Great
thing if SlashSupport becomes a venue. BUT the ppl who have been our
hosts (lateral / Arkin / Focus Infotech) have been nice and never tried
to use the popularity/fame of ILUGC for their own marketing purposes.
ILUGC has been that nice non-commercial group 

<personal thought/rant>
I would love to see ILUGC to remain  non-commercial for the rest of
its/my life.

	That's the way of the world my friend [in case you haven't figured it

Hi all,

Next meet:
Well, Seems like we have one more week for the next meet. I think Mr Bharathi said he will be giving a demo on his IndLinux Prj this time. What else is/are scheduled? What about that kernel talk? And the venue/time?


Request for RHL CD:
Is it possible for me to get a copy of RHL 8.0 CDs (either pre-burnt/returnable, either way), during the next meet. I do not have any fast/permanent net access.



My previous mail (a fortnight back) to the group was "eaten". I do not know if the IndiaTimes Server did that or some other reason was there. But still the gist is....

"Thanks for your valuable comments on the minutes that I wrote. Sorry about the mistakes that I made in it, This could have been avoided, if I had taken the notes on a proper piece of paper (that I left behind in my vehicle), instead of that Kalculate pamphlet :-P. Hope someone (Suraj) has made the necessary corrections to the Minutes before posting it on to the minutes archive."

Hi,
As far as I know, open source gives you the freedom to
make the code propreitary after you make some changes
in the already existing code taken freely by you. But
free software maintains the copyright at all the
stages...

Folks,

I cant bear to see my blunder still continuing. When I
started translating, I came across the text 'The Quick
Brown Fox Jumped Over The Lazy Dogs Back' as the
example text when choosing a font.
In case some of you didnt know, this sentence has all
of the english alphabets, so you get a quick preview
of all the letters.
I couldnt think nor had the skill to come up with an
equivalent Tamil sentence.
Now, could any of you come up with a Tamil sentence
that gives the user a preview of all (not possible,
but mostly used) tamil letters? Any takers.

Regards
Siva

PS: 'yaathum uurae yaavarum kaelir', IMHO, is a
religion by itself. If only everyone followed this
religion, there will be no war/quarrels and no money

GPL never insists on recognising the original author
when you modify and redistribute or distribute without
 modification. 

I didn't find answer why when in the GPL no credit is
given to the orginal author, you insist on GNU prefix
only for Linux.

It is common to call larger entity by some central
point e.g Indian based on Indus river, though we know
India is too large to be identified by, indus river
alone, similarly the central point being the kernel
nothing wrong in calling it by that name.

The difficulty of 'Just kernel and not the OS' can be
realised from  following in the link posted

>GNU kernel back in 1992. If we had realized, then,

 Actually I see mentality of 'missed the bus' in
writings on the link.

	You know, I sure as hell understand the insistence, it is just that I
am tired of the repeated plugs telling people what to call it and making
them appear beyond redemption for having used 'Linux' instead of
'GNU/Linux' 


	I shall not delve into numerous arguments which have already been
presented because I don't see the point in talking about it all over
again but in any case, one thing is clear - the fact that I call it
'Linux' does _not_ mean that I am not aware of or acknowledging the
contributions of GNU. It simply means that I shall call it whatever I
please and I choose to take it easy on my tongue especially when I use
the word a hundred times a day.


	But if you come chasing after each and every one of my mails pulling me
up for not using the term 'GNU/Linux' and making me look like an idiot,
I am not going to be very happy and I sure as hell am going to be
discouraged from posting to the group.


	Regards,

		Ravi

As an "active" member of the group I also share some ethics(atleast as strong as yours ;-)) ) towards the Linux community. 

As an *EMPLOYEE* of the "same" group company, I guess you are very well aware of the fact what kind of field that SlashSupport operates in.

Hi all,

I have a P4. The mother board is an ASUS motherbrd with
Sis650 onboard video card and Sis 7012 audio card.
No linux (or rather GNU/Linux , as some guys would like to have
it) has drivers for these.
RedHat 7.1 -  No X, sound
RedHat 7.2 -     --do--
RedHat 7.0 -     --do--

But the puzzling thing is that Graphical installation works fine in all of
the above. God knows how?

Now i have Mandrake 7.2 running on my system in which the
XF86_FBDev works fine as default. Still no sound :-(
I think i should be the only person in the world using Mandrake 7.2
It must be atleast a century old :(
It doesn't even have wvdial!!

Will RedHat 7.3/8.0 solve my problem? Does anyone have CD's?

bye,
Ram

No I didn't. I was refering to other software companies which have been
helping ILUGC through various means. Obviously IIT isn't going to take
advantage of ILUGC. (-:

praveen> As an *EMPLOYEE* of the "same" group company, I guess you are very well aware of the fact what kind of field that SlashSupport operates in.

Yes. I pretty much know what SlashSupport is into. I know that there are
a few networks / workstations running on GNU/Linux machines and there
are a couple of ppl with GNU/Linux related skills. Here is an excerpt
from the mail that kicha had sent me:

<quote>
Slash is keen on conducting Ilugc meets at its premises.
Actually the proposal was given by praveen and myself during a
discussion with one of the slash member (Ponnurangam).
Now things have gone upto the managment who are also keen on this.

Primarily the management feels that this is a good platform
to attract fresh talents for slash (and yes-  also for CSS).
(You must have noticed the amount of COMMERCIAL mails in ilugc)

I would like you to bring up this issue to chennailug, possibly
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
via a polling at the site. I guess that many might
prefer this place owing to the location. And some may even
figure out the place much easier if they had have come
for the last year's demo day -(Arkins Systems).
</quote>

What do *I* have to do with the decisions here? What right do *I* have
to setup a poll on ILUGC's website? That would be misuse of my
responsibility. When the HCL Aminjikarai guys asked the list that they
were willing to host ILUGC's meets in their premises I had only setup a
vote based on the list's response.

and when I received another mail from you, I replied to you saying that
you should contact the list instead of contacting *me*. I was into the
thinking that if you guys mentioned all that was mentioned in the
personal mail that was sent to me the list would appropriately respond
to it with its own acceptance/denial. But when ponnu contacted the list
he never mentioned about the other things that kicha had mentioned in
the personal mail addressed to me. I was a wee bit worried as to why
your mail (as in kicha's mail) and ponnu's mail were different in their
approach.

praveen> <personal curiosity/doubt>
praveen> Can you please enlighten me on how a problem could be created by conducting a meet at this venue. 
praveen> </personal>

<public's opinion>
Yes, this is the public's opinion because many of us on this list (that
was when zam, thaths, etc., were on this list) decided that this group
should not get commercialised. I hope we still go by that opinion.

I donot want to mention the names of other LUGs that gave way to such a
commercialisation. But all the LUGs that got commercialised only ended
up serving as a passport for finding talents / getting jobs. Ultimately
ILUGC would no longer be the geek's group that it is. 

I was not entirely against SlashSupport becoming the venue. Even now if
ILUGC finds SlashSupport as a good venue ILUGC might as well choose it.
I'm no one to decide things. Nor does any single individual excercise
his/her authority in deciding things. I was a bit concerned that ILUGC
might merely become a place where ppl can recruit 'fresh talents' and
where 'fresh talents' can get jobs. Hence I wanted to voice my views. I
thought this thread would die down gracefully after my reply (assuming
that kicha would pick up a hint that what he expects from this group
isn't correct). but ... you never know what is in store for you.
</public opinion>

Please ask your colleagues on what they had posted before you reply in
frustration. Atleast you can keep up with the 'truth' that way (-;

A couple of questions:

  1.  Could you give us an idea of the number of votes for each
  T-shirt?

  2. If T-shirt 1 has a similar (albeit smaller) number of votes would
  it be possible to arrange for both T's?  I thought the idea behind
  voting and picking for one shirt was that it would be cheaper if
  more folks wanted the same T-shirt.  So if both T-shirts have a
  healthy demand, can both be arranged for?  I hope this is not asking
  for too much of you.

Thanks again!

prabhu

after the boot process is over and  there was no "Display" in the
monitor. I am using "Grub" loader.Could any one give me some pointer
what could be the problem and how to get the Display back.

Thanks,

What is the init runlevel? X is available only in runlevel 5. Check the
runlevel in /etc/inittab. If it is not set to 5, set it and reboot your
system. More details can be found in the same file. Infact in RHL7.3, the
default runlevel is 5, but i donot know whether you made any changes in
your system earlier. Anyway check it out.

oops; that would be http://ftp.iitm.ac.in/LDP

sriram

ps: ok, here is my excuse. the archive is accessed as ftp.cc.iitm.ernet.in 
by people inside iitm campus. it has some more things (windows stuff, for 
example) not available to people outside the iitm campus. the pub tree of 
this site is the root of the ftp.iitm.ac.in site. hence my confusion. hey, 
this is surely better than the famous "late aayiduthu saar"...

Subject: [Ilugc] PPPoE in linux
Message-ID: <3DA14191.2020602@npd.hcltech.com>

Hi,

I want to test the PPPoE setup from linux. In a ethernet LAN, i 
have the access concentrator running ( its IP is 192.168.100.4 
say ) and it provides services of name say "String1" and 
"string2". This is a third party PPPoE access concentrator 
configured.

Now from the same LAN, from a linux machine i want to initiate a 
PPPoE session with the access concentrator. How can i do that 
from linux. I dont have any modem setup to do this ( i dont think 
it required in my case since everything in same ethernet lan. It 
worked from windows too ).

I have roaring PPPoE installed and i did the steps mentioned in
roaring pppoe site for configuration. Also i haven't enabled the 
firewall and dont have my ethernet card configured with a IP address.

When i say "adsl-start" after configuration it is not connecting. 
It is getting timed out. I feel the configuration is the problem. 
How to actually do a connect in this setup.  I have the PPP 
username and password which i have configured in 
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets and sameway for chap too. What i need to do, 
how exactly i can do a connect. I tried adsl-connect too, but it 
didn't worked for me. Kindly help me.

THanks,
Ramesh.

Hi All,

The current method for collating the information of who wants which T-shirt in what size where, seems kind of labour intensive in that it involves the interested ppl mailing Suraj/Somu about the details and then they (S&S?) manually consolidating the information . 

In my college days i developed a lil application to do this very thing :D i.e., enable ppl to order the T-Shirt online, it even had a lil help section wherein you enter height weight age and gender and it figures out the T-shirt size for ya ;). 

Ofcourse this was in asp written for a PWS with MS access as the DB :D (Windozed with capital "W"). So my "idea" is that this can be hosted on (after the necessary modifications) the ILUG page, and ppl can enter the details a-la-online. And it greatly simplifies the consolidation of data of who where which size :D

Any takers?

Cheers,
Venkat

Firstly, I'm not taking orders / processing requests. Its purely somu's
stuff and this business is entire somu's stuff. All losses/profits is
liable only to him ;). 

I'm not into anything with this except that the first design (Debian
Tee) is mine.

If you are interested in taking this up (along with the webmastering)
pls go ahead. The person who first volunteered (Hemant Kumar) hasn't

We cant call the GNU +  Linux as only Linux cause Linux contains only 
the kernel nothing else... other than the kernel all other components we 
find are of
GNU>>


An excerpt from the texts of RMS:

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is not 
the operating system. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system 
that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you 
run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless 
by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating 
system. Linux is normally used in a combination with the GNU operating 
system: the whole system is basically GNU, with Linux functioning as its 
kernel.

Many users are not fully aware of the distinction between the kernel, 
which is Linux, and the whole system, which they also call ``Linux''. 
The ambiguous use of the name doesn't promote understanding. These users 
often think that Linus Torvalds developed the whole operating system in 
1991, with a bit of help.

Programmers generally know that Linux is a kernel. But since they have 
generally heard the whole system called ``Linux'' as well, they often 
envisage a history that would justify naming the whole system after the 
kernel. For example, many believe that once Linus Torvalds finished 
writing Linux, the kernel, its users looked around for other free 
software to go with it, and found that (for no particular reason) most 
everything necessary to make a Unix-like system was already available. 
What they found was no accident--it was the GNU system.

If we tried to measure the GNU Project's contribution in this way, what 
would we conclude? One CD-ROM vendor found that in their ``Linux 
distribution'', GHU Software was the largest single contingent, around 
28% of the total source code, and this included some of the essential 
major components without which there could be no system. Linux itself 
was about 3%. So if you were going to pick a name for the system based 
on who wrote the programs in the system, the most appropriate single 
choice would be ``GNU''.

The GNU Project's aim was to develop a complete free Unix-like system: GNU.

We use Linux-based GNU systems today for most of our work, and we hope 
you use them too. But please don't confuse the public by using the name 
``Linux'' ambiguously. Linux is the kernel, one of the essential major 
components of the system. The system as a whole is more or less the GNU 
system, with Linux added. When you're talking about this combination, 
please call it ``GNU/Linux''.

An excerpt from the texts of <b>RMS</b>:<br>
<br>
</font>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1">  There really is
a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is not the operating system.
 Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's
resources to the other programs that you run.  The kernel is an essential
part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function
in the context of a complete operating system.  Linux is normally used in
a combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically
GNU, with Linux functioning as its kernel.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1">  Many users are not
fully aware of the distinction between the kernel, which is Linux, and the
whole system, which they also call ``Linux''. The ambiguous use of the name
doesn't promote understanding.  These users often think that Linus Torvalds
developed the whole operating system in 1991, with a bit of help.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1"> Programmers generally
know that Linux is a kernel.  But since they have generally heard the whole
system called ``Linux'' as well, they often envisage a history that would
justify naming the whole system after the kernel.  For example, many believe
that once Linus Torvalds finished writing Linux, the kernel, its users looked
around for other free software to go with it, and found that (for no particular
reason) most everything necessary to make a Unix-like system was already available. 
 What they found was no accident--it was the GNU system.</font>  </p>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1">  If we tried to measure
the GNU Project's contribution in this way, what would we conclude?  One
CD-ROM vendor found that in their ``Linux distribution'', GHU Software was
the largest single contingent, around 28% of the total source code, and this
included some of the essential major components without which there could
be no system.  Linux itself was about 3%.  So if you were going to pick a
name for the system based on who wrote the programs in the system, the most
appropriate single choice would be ``GNU''.  </font></p>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1">The GNU Project's aim
was to develop <em>a complete free Unix-like system</em>: GNU.  </font><br>
<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="-1">  We use Linux-based
GNU systems today for most of our work, and we hope you use them too.  But
please don't confuse the public by using the name ``Linux'' ambiguously.
 Linux is the kernel, one of the essential major components of the system.
 The system as a whole is more or less the GNU system, with Linux added.
 When you're talking about this combination, please call it ``GNU/Linux''.

  <p>one small thought on all this. (dunno if it is right.... plz don't bomb

Agreed, a small correction. Not _all_ the components are from GNU.  GNU
aimed at giving a completely free operating system. Whenever the project
found an existing component that would fill in a gap the component was
used. The X-Window System and a variety of other such components were
used in a GNU system for this purpose.

What free software advocates must talk instead is about the goal of this
project. the linux project had no aim of giving a completely free
operating system. Nor does linus torvalds. In a recent interview in
BBC's clickonline he said with a tint of pun: "many people take this
operating system too seriously". We now live in a cyber era where
hospitals, flight control systems and defense systems use computers.
Operating systems are no longer just softwares that control the hardware
of a computer. OSes control the way we live our lives and IMHO it is
serious when we are not able to control the way we live.

Even more worse with this show on BBC: Linus was hailed as the person
who invented a revolutionary 'OS'. He was even asked how he is going to
take Linux to the desktop users. how weird? :)

Hi,

At last yesterday night i have loaded RHL 8.0 IN MY
SYSTEM.

The GUI is too good and this time Linux made common
tool for most of the Applications instated of using
two tools for one aplication.(like Kpagage for KDE and
Gnorpm for GNOME)

We most have three CDs to install all aplictions.

Bluecurve is one of the best Gui in the world.

It is easy to use first time Linux user.Once people
start to work in RHL they never go back to Stupid
Microsoft Windows.



Thanks
Opera.

Open IT: Govt to rewrite source code in Linux
SUDHA NAGARAJ

TIMES NEWS NETWORK   [ WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 09, 2002 01:29:29 AM]

NEW DELHI: If the Chinese have IT, get it. The Indian government seems to
be taking a leaf out of China's operating system, and is planning a
countrywide drive to promote the open source operating system, Linux, as
the 'platform of choice' instead of 'proprietary' solutions.


For proprietory, read Microsoft, which controls over 90% of the desktop
software market.


The Department of Information Technology has already devised a strategy to
introduce Linux and open source software as a de-facto standard in academic
institutions, especially in engineering colleges through course work that
encourages use of such systems.


Research establishments would be advised to use and develop
re-distributable toolboxes just as Central government departments and state
governments would be asked to use Linux-based offerings.


DIT is in talks with leading industry players like IBM and HCL to get a
feel of their work in the area and invite proposals for joint projects. "As
a first step we are persuading all government institutions to offer courses
on Linux and programming for Linux environment. We would also set up Linux
Resource Centres in academic institutes (with co-funding from government
and industry)," said a senior government official.


Though India has made a name for itself selling solutions, software as a
product is expensive within the country. And the cost will bite once India
starts implementing IPR protection in earnest, as it has committed itself
to.


While redistribution of proprietary software is restricted through a
licence agreement, the licensing terms for Linux grants the right to obtain
and redistribute copies. Many analysts believe that China's growing
dominance in the IT space is fuelled by its low cost open source bias.


The Chinese government has consistently promoted its local software based
on Linux, both for cost reasons, and reportedly for 'security' concerns as
well.


The source code for proprietory software is not revealed, and this, it is
believed, has not found favour with the Chinese, especially in defence and
security related applications.


Microsoft, in what many observers and reports say is an attempt to soften
the Chinese government's stand, recently committed to investing $750m in
China in three years to help set up a software college and put its money
into Chinese education.


In comparison, Microsoft has announced investments worth only $75m over a
three-year time frame in India. Howver, the Chinese company Redflag
Software, which was set up by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the
country's most prestigious research institute, has often come out with
low-cost software based on Linux, in direct competition to Windows-based
software.


The Indian government's plan, however, is not driven by security concerns,
but by the far more simple arithmetic of costing. To put it simply, India
being a developing country needs low cost solutions.


Unlike the Microsoft-developed Windows operating system, Linux code is free
and downloadable from the internet. With the addition of special
applications, it can be personalized to meet specific needs.


An industry-government-user-developer conference on the subject would be
organised to throw up ideas for specific initiatives including funding,
reliable sources told ET.


The only issue here is support and services, which Indian government
sources feel is not likely to be an issue in a country known for its
software support and service skills.


Like China, the government is also eyeing the increasingly lucrative global
support and services market for the Linux environment may prove lucrative.
While proprietary support agreements govern only the systems purchased
(with licences), for free software support is independent of the number of
copies owned.


"With applications in security being a focus area, inputs have been sought
from the Defence on their experience with Linux. Indian-language based
solutions, e-governance, embedded and high performance cluster solutions
are other areas. But firstly we want to concretise the position on IPR
issues in the use of Linux," the source said.


DIT is planning a three-tier mechanism, with itself as the first, industry,
user groups and state governments as the second and a national apex
committee headed either by a government representative, an industry expert
or an academician to oversee manpower and skill development, applications
development and deployment and public policy support, said sources.


According to IDC's figures for '00, Microsoft still controlled 94% of the
desktop software market and while Linux is expected to overtake the number
two - Apple Mac OS - by '03, it would still control less than 4% of the
market.


In server software, it fares a little better and is expected to control
around 30% of the market by '03, according to IDC. Linux, which has
established itself in the server space, is an open reliable OS that runs on
virtually any platform and was developd by Finnish technologist Linus
Torvalds.


After developing the initial source code, Linus made it available on the
Internet for use, feedback and further development.

Hi Luggies,

  Atlast it good news folks.Almost all of them had agreed to pay 
135/= for the T-shirts. Just to remind you ,tshirt1(Debian) and 
tshirt2(I USE GNU) are the ones which are going to be 
printed.Thank you for making your selection for the T-shirt 
Designs.

Now we are into the second stage, which is nothing but collecting 
of money and the most important one too.  Here are the PAYMENT 
DETAILS. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY!!!!.

The money will be collected during this month's(OCTOBER 2002) LUG 
meet. Check out this month's meet details at 
http://chennailug.org. It should be updated hopefully by Prabhu or 
Suraj.

1. People residing in chennai can come to the LUG meet and 
handover the money to me in person which will be the BEST option 
or else they can send CROSSED CHEQUES in favour of V S 
Somasundaram. Send cheques if and only if you will not be able to 
make it to the meet. As soon as I receive your cheques I will send 
you acknowledgements through mail.

My address is as follows:

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210111353290.20044-100000@gateway.aero.iitm.ernet.in>

hi all,

courtesy of some kind folks (Suseelan B Sarin <ee98291@ee.iitm.ernet.in>
and Saurabh Jain <ee98290@kaveri.ee.iitm.ernet.in>), redhat 8.0 is now
available on ftp.iitm.ac.in; instead of upgrading to 'gnu/linux 3.0', i
decided to upgrade from redhat 7.3 to 8.0; upgrade proceeded smoothly -
but took way too long (do i hear bloatware?). on my home machine which is
a p3-800 with 192mb ram, it took two hours (i have installed a fair amount
of junk on this machine). even on my p4-1.7ghz-256mb, it took well over an
hour. the binaries are distributed over 3 cd's and chances are you will
need all three for an install. some new packages that caught my eye
include openoffice 1.0.1, squirrelmail and a set of gui config tools for 
many system services like bind, httpd, firewall etc. (have not tried any 
of these yet). the new redhat desktop has a nice look and feel. gcc is now 
the officially stable version 3.2 which was released in august(?). overall 
opinion - look and feel is nice, but feels bloated. like in the windows 
world, unless you have a faster machine with more ram, you will probably 
not be too happy with this upgrade.

Subject: [Ilugc] Situation of Linux in India
Message-ID: <20021011121520.GA1056@plumeyer.homelinux.org>

Hi Linux comrades,

I am a Linux enthusiast from Germany, have tamil friends from Sri Lanka
and a girl-friend from Calcutta.
Excuse me, if my english is somewhat poor, my questions too direct or
simply uninteresting.

Recently I read in the news, that there is an initiative from the
Department of Information Technology to replace governmental software by
Linux. I am curious about that.
Here in Germany in a slow speed we face the same tendency.

I would like to know, if there are good possibilities for Linux freaks to
get work, if there is also a strong Linux community in India, and the
influence of the recession in the computer industry.
Here in Germany the "new economy" bubble lead to a high rate of
unemployment in that area. In the same time, because of the same
recession, Linux is more demanded, but more in a "hidden" way.
There are not many public demands explicitely for Linux guys, but 
it is widely used.
The Linux community here is not as "high" as it was in the years 98-99,
but it is steadily growing. Even elder people are beginning to use it
nowerdays.
The main network magazines are in reality Linux magazines, > 70% of the
articles are about Linux solutions.

And somehow the german mentality is perfect for Linux, because we are
rather technical and "stiff" folks.

Would you be so kind to enlighten a bit my knowledge about the Linux
situation in India?

Many thanks in advance from 

Jochen Plumeyer

We aren't native speakers too, so lets forgive each other ;-)

jochen> Recently I read in the news, that there is an initiative from the

Our political system / attitude of many authoritative ppl in the govt
has been such that no matter how good/bad something is, they always try
and keep things without any change. It is infact something good that we
should appreciate Mr.Pramod for his effort, but people suspect this
could just be an attempt to initiate 'under-the-bench' transactions
between proprietary software companies and the ministers. 

I guess, our govt decided to embrace GNU/Linux because it heard from all
around that it is 'free of cost'. Bad that most of us didn't talk of
GNU/linux as the freedom software, we would repent if the Indian govt
drops the idea of using GNU/Linux on the reason that their _current_
softwares are given free of cost to them.

jochen> I would like to know, if there are good possibilities for Linux freaks to

of late there has been a little but noticeable spurt in recruits for ppl who
have free software skills. Mostly for kernel ppl who can write device
drivers, embedded systems et al. I donot know if this would again be
something like the dotcom burst. *shrug*

I think, government of Kerala has learned it the hard
way. By burning their fingers. Did you know that CDit,
the IT spear head of the State Government is the 2nd
accused in the first criminal case ever to be
registered under the IT Act. This is what happened
according to a report in MADHYAMAM.
 In 1999 the CDit entered in to some MoU with the
Microsoft. ( I am searching the eact text of this
MoU). CDit is the "total solution provider" in IT for
the Government. When the Govt wanted to start a
"Computer Integrated Service Centre" popularly called
'friends' (the place where you can remit all the
government dues under one roof) they constituted a IT
Mission Group. C Dit was requiered to submit a report
on the project. There in the company called
Comteckcomes to the picture. It is said that the idea
was to start a joint venture. It was decided to use
the Microsfot Technology based on the MoU and Comtech
was a company in the "Microsoft Development Forum".
This is is why the company came to the picture at all.
Otherwise we do not know any other major project done
by Comtech. We then find that the pilot project of
'friends' started to function at Trivandrum. The
Software was made jointly by the Comtech and CDit. But
when there was a proposal to expand the project to
other 13 centres, the term "software made in the joint
project" sudenly changed in to "software Comtech
developed free of cost for CDit". As usual CDit was
not slow to accept this and the project was expanded
to 13 more centres at the cost of 13 Lakhs. (Here we
pause to think, does this include the charge of
liceneced Windows version on each computer at the 13
centres. I dont think so. As far as my understanding
goes, many of the Public Sector Undertakings and Banks
are using pirated copies thinking that they are
licence. They do pay for the same. But that payment
does not make Gates any richer because it never reach
him.) After the above transaction the Comtech seem to
have claimed another 12 Lakhs to give the rights to
CDit for expanding the project to other places also.
Instead of this the Cdit entered in to an agreement to
pay Rs. 2200/- per month for each centre every month.
Based on this some 19 Lakhs of Rs. is already given to
the Comtech. It is also understood that the Comtech
had by then changed the codes and the source code was
never made available to the CDit. While so to make
some minor changes to enable acceptance of Fees by the
Kerala University through the Friends centres, the
company claimed Rs. 32000. Frustrated at the attitude
of the Comtech, it seems that the CDit approached
another private company for a new software. When this
was seen as a threat to the monopoly they enjoyed till
then the Comtech filed Criminal Complaints against the
new company and also the Director of CDit.

CDit will for sure accept a change to the free
software in this background. There is a move to make
it mandatory for government bodies to use only open
software in California and Peru.

We must move for a comprehensive legislation in this
regard according to me.

As for the carriculam at schools, I heard there is a
circular to upgrade to windows 98 or higher for all
schools. No funds are sanctioned. The government for
sure expects the schools to pirate it. I think we must
undertake a study of this in the first place and also
go forward with alternatives. We must ensure that the
students are aware of the alternatives.

No. I 'group reply' the mail that I receive on mailing lists OR mails
that have CC lists. Reason:
  
   1. Many Mailing lists like ILUGC's list donot munge the headers. By
   this it leaves the Reply-to intact. So if I <suraj@foo.com> wants to
   receive all my replies on suraj@bar.com, I would still be able to do
   that when munging is not done. There are two arguments to this:

   Munging is useful:
      http://www.metasystema.org/essays/reply-to-useful.mhtml
   Munging Harmful:
      http://www.interhack.net/pubs/munging-harmful/

cm> And the same is tru for 'Prabhu Ramachandran'

because he does group reply too (-:

Hi Mohan,
  pppd is Point 2 Point Protocol deamon. It is needed to help u connect using a ppp connection (which is what your dial up connection is). Check out if there is a how-to for this.

ncftp knows a recursive mode, and has very handy features.

Subject: [Ilugc] Minutes of the Meeting - 12 Oct 2002
Message-ID: <200210121422.TAA28209@WS0005.indiatimes.com>

Hi guys,

Once again, I am trying to bring out the Minutes of the Meeting, for the one 
that was held on 12th October, at "3:00PM". 

It was only after 3:30 that there were some "sizable" number of people in 
the meet. The reason for the thin attendance can is being attributed to the 
less number of mails about the location and timing of the meet, and the 
non-availability of the information in the website till today morning.

First was a small chitchat, about GPGP passphrases, the lengths, bruteforce 
attacks, protecting the files by using "rootsquashing" (not sure about the 
spelling- Prabhu, pl correct me), and so on.

Then Sriram Karra, came up to the stage to put forth his "long dormant" idea 
on an application that could prove useful to most of us.

Command line interface (CLI) and Graphical user interface(GUI) are widely 
used and each have their own advantages (mutually exclusive) and patrons. 
But in CLI, we tend to forget the parameters for many of the commands. One 
of the famous examples is the FIND command. It has too many options and too 
many features, that you forget the commands quickly. In order to find a 
solution to this problem, Karra proposes a new software that will pop-up a 
window, and will have all the options available to us in a GUI form.

Prabhu introdused us to "Kaptain". This has a script of its own, and we can 
tell the command and the different parameters to it, and it will generate a 
GUI for us, which will get us the desired functionality. It looked as if it 
is infringing into the "patents" of Karra, but one difference. Karra wants 
it to generate the command line and put it back on the  console, so that we 
can see the actual parameters also, and we can use the same to repeat the 
same process.

It was Somu's turn (who walked in late), to collect money for the Tee 
Shirts. There was a confusion on the sizes of the various Tees. To what 
sizes does L, XL, and XXL translate to was a major problem while placing the 
orders. I hope he will be able to clarify the same for us very soon.

Mr. Bharathi took us to his "demo lab" to show us the Ind-Linux project. It 
was a really amazing lab. He showed us his Tamil/Hindi inscript typing 
capabilities of his library level software. Since the translation is done at 
the library level, what-ever application we use, will be able to use the 
capabilities. The backspace problem as discussed in the previous meet was 
also shown. The console version of the software was not available as there 
were no ext2 machines available at the demo lab( the kernel which was 
developed with ind-linux capabilities doesnot support ext3).

There was also a small demo on the amazing WLL facilities. Simultaneous 
voice/data transfer and other capabilities were also displayed. It was 
amazing to see HS-DSL at work, with a streaming video image being webcast.

The "server" room (exchange room), of the demo was also excellent. A 
"small"(in size) exchange which can serve 1000 lines is used for the demo. 
Three machines running RHL, (one of them a server) are used to monitor every 
aspect of the exchange, including the CARD status, the users, 
functioning/failure of different nodes etc... elaborate log files are also 
created by these.

The WLLs on display are actually capable for a range of 25KMs (but 
configured here only for a few 100 mts.). A repeater that can extend the 
range base stations was also on display. These people do some really 
excellent work for the cause of the villagers. Presently they are aiming at 
Village level kiosks. This is a huge project with more than 1,500 people, 
and three companies participating, to provide access to rural India. Already 
the system is under experimentation in some villages in TN, and very soon we 
can see it in work in Gujarat. The Indianisation of the display (local 
language), is one of the major parts of the whole project.

I think there will be a repetition of this demo during the next meet, for 
the benefit of those who missed the same.

When we returned to the Meeting hall, Suraj (late comer) was ready to put 
forth is pans for his "School Demo" that he is organizing in a school in 
Chrompet. He has got some 6 volunteers , and two PCs for display. More info can be had directly from him 
(suraj@chennailug.org).

Thanks to the new coordinator Mr. Bharathi for providing that demo, and helping me in getting to Srivathsan to pick up RHL 8 CDs. Thanks Mr.Srivathsan, for the CDs, I will try to return them ASAP.


Thank you,

Natarajan

Dont know if this is of any help but s3 Savage cards are supported by
X 4.1.0.  Just install xserver-xfree86 and when debconf asks you to
choose the card pick the appropriate one (savage is the right driver).
I think debconf does a decent job of handling the setup.  No need to
fiddle with xf86config.

cheers,

If you chose the modern 4.x X-server, try it with

	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86

The dialogue style depends on your selection of debconf (I set "Dialog").
Change it with

	dpkg-reconfigure debconf

"xserver-s3" is not the optimal X-server for modern S3-cards, I think.
After choosing "xserver-xfree86", you should try the "savage" driver.

The rest depends on your monitor etc. Additionaly "xvidtune" helps to get
the right modlines.

Cheers,

Jochen

If its about having a customisable command line completion,
bash_completion (source /etc/bash_completion) on Bash2 does the job.
there are a good stock of bash functions in place already to do stuff
like completing the host names while sshing, etc., Since these are
functions all that we need to do is to write a function that will pop up
some window and then return the strings for insertion into the command
line.

Great minutes once again!

I got to hear from a bunch of ppl (Yourself (nat) and Manikandan P) that
you guys were willing to take up webmastering ILUGC. There was also
kicha who volunteered to be the webmaster. Now its upto you guys to
decide on this and tell me if a vote is necessary.

Hi All,
        Is there any way to make nfs mount
 transparent to the local system, ie) I have
 a user(same UID) in nfsserver and client machines,
 as a user I can create a file and change the
 file access permissions in the nfs partition, 
 but as a root I can't change anything in the nfs
 mounted partition.
 
     In nfserver my export file is,
 
 # cat /etc/exports 
 /usr/local/nfstest 192.168.0.247(rw) 
 
 is there a way?? any help/suggestion!! 
 
 Thanks,
 Bala.

By default (for security), root on the client machine cannot write to
a remotely mounted NFS share.  To allow root to write add a
no_root_squash option to the servers /etc/exports file like so:

/usr/local/nfstest 192.168.0.247(rw,no_root_squash) 

For more details read the man page for exports (man exports).

Hi,

It works with the no_root_squash option, later
I may need to think about security.

It is not really about "completion" in any sense.  Basically, my point
is this: There is something lacking in a command line interface.  

A cli enhances productivity when the user knows exactly what command
to use and the exact syntax of the command.  But consider what happens
when you do not know anything about the command.  Me feels that
pouring over man pages is a terrible waste of time.  Here is where a
GUI rules.  BUt using a gui repeatedly is a bloody Pita.

So, can we come up with a mechanism whereby we have a gui that will
help us become better *cli* users ??

The answer is yes.  When my idea is fully implemented, you will have
the following:

1. You are at the shell and you are about to type a command.
2. You get stuck somewhere because you do not know what is the name of
   the flag that accomplishes your task.
3. So, you type some magic sequence that will bring on a gui version
   for this command.
4. You will click some buttons, choose a radio button or whatever
   based on information present there.  Then you will press "exit".
5. The software will now generate the right CLI and put it at your
   cursor, which you can then execute.

What the program has done for you is this: it has taught you the cli
command you were searching for.  And now that you know the cli flag
for your task, you can skip the gui invocation from next time.  There!
we have just used the gui to help us become better cli users.

Now is this a better approach than pouring over tonnes of man pages?
I say yes!

I took a quick look at Kaptain.  It works *exactly* as I had
anticipated.  The only part that needs to be done is integrate it with
bash and like shells.  And this should not really be very difficult.

Typically bash_completion can be programmed to do the task that you are
looking for. type the following and see what happens:

example #1: 

$ source /etc/bash_completion
$ apt-get <tab><tab>
--assume-yes      --list-cleanup    --trivial-only    -y
--build           --no-act          --version         autoclean
--compile         --no-download     --yes             build-dep
--config-file     --no-remove       -b                check
....
...
$ apt-get install foo<tab><tab>
fookb                  foomatic-bin           foomatic-db-gimpprint
fookb-plainx           foomatic-data          
fookb-wmaker           foomatic-db            

$ apt-get install foo

Example #2:

$ ssh <tab><tab>
171.64.67.68     203.199.197.48   64.38.242.11     freeshells.org
171.64.67.72     209.15.95.192    66.54.4.34       gpasokan.com
192.168.1.1      24.26.85.231     av.stanford.edu  suraj.sytes.net
203.197.130.30   63.194.20.32     symonds.net

$ ssh 

Now is a GUI necessary? (-:

These examples dont cover many things they are very rudimentary.  For
instance do this:

 find . -na<tab> 

and you get -name.  I ask so what?  I also want to see what the name
flag means and how to use it (possibly with an example) etc.  Is that
possible right now?  No!  It can be done with text and there is a very
nice Python interpreter (pure text - no GUI) that does something
similar but not as complete.  Anyway point is the idea is interesting
and useful.

    SK> Now is a GUI necessary? (-:

Yes, very much.  In case you did not realize, the CLI is also a GUI,
its just that its all in pure text.  The point is if you abstract out
everything so that any type of GUI is possible the whole thing becomes
more powerful.  So on the console you use a curses based GUI or if
that is not available just use plain text.  Otherwise you get a nice
GUI where you can select stuff, look at help, search for help, look
for examples etc.

Yes.  

where is the help?  Where is the explanation for each flag?  The bash
completion thing is not a replacement for looking up man pages.  The
use of kaptain and my proposed glue code will do just that.

Fundamentally, you are refusing to acknowledge that a cli, by
definition is a uni-directional information passing mechanism - The
user sends commands to the other side and gets back results.  Any
hacks to improve it are just that - hacks.  A gui, otoh, is by
definition a two way information exchange mechanism.  The user reacts
to information already available in the form of pictures, menus etc.

oh well, I misunderstood your proposal. I thought you were looking at a
way of intelligent / interactive command-line completion.

Brinch hansen - he has written a few books on OS - had a nice design for
this. But I dont recall
the details now.It was specified as details of the book; but this was not as
detailed a help as
Sriram has specified

IN circa 1991 - ne of the most heavily used program in the Unix class
we used to teach was a curses based help for c library functions
and unix commands

This was written by a student as his project and in my memory this was the
only project that continued to be used and even available after the batch
completed.

A bash completion style help system may be quite useful (?)1 - ie if I hit
Meta Tab
I am asking what this option means.

Hello Sriram!

I think, this is a superb, excellent, necessary [etc...] idea.

Also, this can be a HUGE project. I am thinking of the interfaces, to
make that program scalable. A (simple) database will be necessary, that
contains parameters, flags and comments. In the beginning a XML database
perhaps is overkill, but in the long run it should be ok.

When I hit the <TAB> button twice, I got 2354 possibilities.
So, how could we have the chance to feed the database in a complete way?
I ask myself, how to obtain this information automatically. Could this
be extracted from man-pages or the texinfo/ info-files?

I don't know the nroff or info-format very well. But I saw, that command
options appear after an ".IP " nroff-command in the man-pages?
If I knew that, I could write a parser for it.

The good thing about the extraction strategy is, that there is still a
quite complete information source to use. But I don't know the level of
standardization of man-pages.


I also think, that there should be an interface to build different types
of GUIs. For example, it could be readline, Curses::Widgets, Gtk or
QT-based (or what toolkit the user wants). So I think we should build
generic programs, that can appear according to that parameter database.
The only information that they need, is already written command line, to
make proposals.

Let's brainstorm more all around the globe :)

Jochen

BTW.: How do we call the project? 
"SCCL" = SoftCore Command Line ? :)

Sriram,

Thanks for the response. I think this should not

create a set of working CD's,and install the OS, pls
call Anbu and let him decide.

Hello Luggies,

  Once again it's Somu. People who attended this month's(OCT) meet 
paid the money to me for the T-shirts. Someone from the crowd 
raised this doubt "What is the size of L,XL and XXL T-shirts?. A 
valid question, because it differs from company to company.

After which I verified about this with the printer and came to 
know that it is the standard size which most of us use. Here are 
the details:

L - 40
XL - 42
XXL - 44


NOTE: Those who have sent cheques through mail, please send an

Hello Luggies,

  Once again it's Somu. People who attended this month's(OCT) 
meet
paid the money to me for the T-shirts. Someone from the crowd
raised this doubt "What is the size of L,XL and XXL T-shirts?. A
valid question, because it differs from company to company.

After which I verified about this with the printer and came to
know that it is the standard size which most of us use. Here are
the details:

L - 40
XL - 42
XXL - 44

Very much. Please do it now. (: But when you do, use the right terms to
search. For instance if you searched about the linux kernel with the
keyword 'linux', you would hit 'linux.com' which does not talk only
about the kernel but also about all the other softwares that donot
belong to the kernel. When you use the correct term - 'GNU/Linux' and
search you would hit 'gnu.org' and from there you can find out what
_exactly_ this OS is and why it is special / different from other
unices.

sp> >From my understanding..Opensource softwares (be it OS

There are two commonly used terminologies in this regard:

  1. Free Softwares
  2. Open Sources Softwares

  A Free Software is one which gives the following freedoms to the user:

    1. Freedom to use the program for any purpose
    2. Freedom to study the source code (hence source code must be made
    available)
    3. Freedom to modify it
    4. Freedom to share it

    A few examples of such Free Softwares: 

     GNU Bash, Apache, XFree86, the Linux Kernel

Open source on the other hand is a little different. Most of open source
softwares give the above freedoms. Although some donot. Some softwares
(like QTopia) are not supposed to be used for commercial purposes (hence
denying Freedom#1). Moreover ppl from the open source movement donot
talk about the freedom aspect of softwares. Some of the Free Softwares
are 'free' indeed but give 'total' freedom that allows one to even use
it in non-free softwares. Ultimately the efforts of a free software
developer goes into helping a non-free software's development. Some ppl
see this as 'okay, so what? let him use it'. Some say 'no, I wont help a
person who does not help me'. Depends on your mindset. (:

You can sell you software. Only thing is that the source code goes along
with it.

GNU/Linux is different because when the Free Software movement started,
it aimed at giving a completely free operating system. This was not the
aim of HP, Solaris and other proprietary OSes.

What does he mean by 'entire shell coding'?

Free Software is NOT FREEWARE. Freeware might just be free of cost. Free
softwares allow you to do anything with the source code (firstly source
code isn't available for most of the freeware/shareware tools).

It would be nice. (: if MS makes all its products as free softwares, Its
a BIG success for us. But I dont see this happening anytime. I heard
there are even undocumented API calls. Let them document their API
properly first :P

Does that matter? If windows is going to become a free software, do
we have to care? They will no longer be one of 'them'. They will be one
of 'us' :)

That is a very important point you have made.  I think the reason
Kaptain has not got the attention / user base it deserves is because
of the lack of flags specifications for many commands.  And also
because such spec files need to be generated by hand.

If the process could be automated, as you suggest, the software will
meet with greater acceptance.

short answer: cd to /var/yp and run make. this will propagate the change 
to all clients. in future, you can use yppasswd on the server also to 
change password.

long answer: well, nis password change is partially broken in redhat
distros upto and including 7.3 (haven't tried on 8.0 yet). using nis,
since the passwords are on the server and not on the client, the
'classical' way of doing password change was to use yppasswd command
(instead of the passwd command). this would communicate with server and
make the change in the proper manner - in the passwd file on the server
and also in the nis database. every time a user changes a password thusly,
the server has to rebuild the nis database so that the change is seen by
all clients. if the passwd command is used on the server (not the yppasswd
command), it will update the passwd file but not the nis database - so
clients will continue to use the old password that was in the database.
this would appear to be the problem in this case. this can be fixed by
cd'ing to /var/yp and running make (which will rebuild the databases). the
permanent fix for this is to not run passwd on the server but only
yppasswd so that the database is rebuilt automatically. however, this
would need the server also to be a nis client. also, admin users like root
cannot use this method since traditionally these passwords are not part of
the nis database. enter the well known kludge of making passwd a link to
yppasswd and saving the real 'passwd' command for use by admin users only.
with newer version of nis and redhat, things are done better (through pam)
and invoking passwd command on the nis clients correctly invokes the yp
call to the server. as of redhat 7.3, invoking passwd on the server does
make the change to the database and the file but an error message pops up
claiming that the change has not been made (maybe, there is something in 
my config file that is wrong; i dont think so).

if you are running an rpm based distribution (redhat etc), i would 
recommend getting the rpm and installing it. as of redhat 8.0, 
squirrelmail is part of the distribution. the will help you in future if 
you upgrade to a newer version of squirrelmail (file locations vary 
between tar.gz version and rpm version).

squirrelmail works just fine, so you could stick to it. check the file 
permits - the login.php script should have rx permits for your web server 
(all scripts should have this, in fact). using the rpm also takes care of 
this file permits business.

'rx' permission is not necessary if you have compiled php as a module
for your webserver. But when it runs as a CGI app (using a php
interpreter) the execute permission is necessary and also the ExecCGI
option should be given for the directory in question.

Hi,

I am trying to use ldap authentication module for courier imap. 
Every time I try to connect  (thru authtest ) i get the error 
"chdir: No such file or directory" though the authentication 
succeeds.
I have included authldap schema and used the same to set up the 
user details in the openldap server.
The default mail directory ie Maildir does exist and i am able to 
set up the authentication using PAM.
It's just the ldap authentication that's giving me the 
creeps.........

Hello,

I am looking at Zope with ZEO and WebDAV (I need more than just PHP or ASP or

The last redhat alpha port is 7.1. Redhat has stopped supporting the
alpha port since then. By choosing redhat, you will be left out on
future upgrades.

Can I recommend Debian instead? I run three alpha server 800s at work
all running Debian and it has much to recommend.

On the same note, I've also tried debian on several sun hardware, sgi
indy and a titanium macintosh with great success. Debian is the linux of
choice on non-x86 platforms.

Debian network install (boot using dhcp/bootp + tftp) on an alpha is very
easy. You'll only need a single 4MB tftpboot.img file to get the
installer started, and the base debian system is about 30MB.

See the installation instructions for alpha at -

Dear Friends						17-10-2002
	
	Thanks for Raja and Surya narayanan. 

	I will try installing Debian version but the problem is that, the 
commercial software in our office runs basically on Redhat
versions. Thats the reason behind my search. 

	I will try to download the Debian version as Raja had quoted and
try installing the commercial software in it.

	I once again thank you all for sending me an immediately reply.

short answer: cd to /var/yp and run make. this will propagate the change 
to all clients. in future, you can use yppasswd on the server also to 
change password.

long answer: well, nis password change is partially broken in redhat
distros upto and including 7.3 (haven't tried on 8.0 yet). using nis,
since the passwords are on the server and not on the client, the
'classical' way of doing password change was to use yppasswd command
(instead of the passwd command). this would communicate with server and
make the change in the proper manner - in the passwd file on the server
and also in the nis database. every time a user changes a password thusly,
the server has to rebuild the nis database so that the change is seen by
all clients. if the passwd command is used on the server (not the yppasswd
command), it will update the passwd file but not the nis database - so
clients will continue to use the old password that was in the database.
this would appear to be the problem in this case. this can be fixed by
cd'ing to /var/yp and running make (which will rebuild the databases). the
permanent fix for this is to not run passwd on the server but only
yppasswd so that the database is rebuilt automatically. however, this
would need the server also to be a nis client. also, admin users like root
cannot use this method since traditionally these passwords are not part of
the nis database. enter the well known kludge of making passwd a link to
yppasswd and saving the real 'passwd' command for use by admin users only.
with newer version of nis and redhat, things are done better (through pam)
and invoking passwd command on the nis clients correctly invokes the yp
call to the server. as of redhat 7.3, invoking passwd on the server does
make the change to the database and the file but an error message pops up
claiming that the change has not been made (maybe, there is something in 
my config file that is wrong; i dont think so).

Hi,
	I changed from KDE 2.2.2 to KDE 3.0.4 on a Debian Woody. The font sizes 9, 10 
dont seem to differ in their sizes. Moreover there is a big increase in size 
from size 8 to size 9. This happens for quite a few pairs. What could be the 
problem??

	Remove netgroup from the list of makefile targets. I wonder why this
hackery is needed but I remember having to do it myself too - but that
was a long time ago.

	Edit the makefile you see in that directory.

Hi all,

I'm facing problem in installing Redhat 7.3 in Intel845GV board.  After the 
installation, the booting is not getting completed.  It hangs, after the USB 
hardware detection. Anybody faced the same kind of problem.  Yeah, that VESA 
display will work with Inten 845 chipset, but I don't know why is it 
hanging.

Yes I also faced the same problem.  What I did was commented out the line in
the modules.conf that was loading the EHCI module and now it is boots fine.
I think in RH7.3 EHCI built into the kernel that's problem.
Has anynody tried with RH8.0 on this board.

Thanks

Gopinathan posts :

I am really going to throw a stone to get your issue fixed.....
Maybe the real issue would lie in the Xserver configuration.


>> VESA display will work with Inten 845 chipset, but I don't know why
>> is it hanging

It is maybe due to the fact that the framebuffer is not being setup by
the default value in /etc/lilo.conf or /boot/grub/menu.lst

Try passing  this option to the  kernel while booting up  via the boot
loader, `video=vesa:800x600-16@60'

YMMV.

There are a good number of partition editors under GNU/Linux. 

There is the standard fdisk program. A little more menu driven
(text-only) partitioning program is cfdisk. If you want to create
partitions without losing data consider using GNU parted. For
non-destructive partitioning of windows partitions try FIPS. 

General tip: create the swap partition at the end. With my little
knowledge of harddisks and their physical organisation I think when the
swap is at the edge of the disk the access time would be faster and it
helps a lot when your machine is low on primary memory. so making swap
as the last partition might improve performance.

Given that seek time outweighs rotational latency of HDDs by a wide
margin, it could be argued that placing swap in the middle of a disk
would offer better performance (since it minimizes head movement on
average).

But ofcourse, this is subject to where the disk head spends most of its
time. The Linux Partitioning Howto and the Multi Disk System Tuning
Howto discuss partitioning in more detail that anyone would ever care to
know :-)

The FreeBSD tuning(7) manpage also offers some insights -

The passwords are checked using the IMAP server.
The IMAP server should run on port 143. If some other port
is used, it can be specified in the config.php file of squirrelmail

Hi,

This mail is for those who haven't paid the money yet. Please 
ignore this mail if you had already made the payment.

I haven't received cheque or cash from you till date. I think most 
of you are aware of the deadline which is 23/10/2002(for chennai 
people) and 25/10/2002(for outstation people). I am a litte 
disappointed. Anyway, even if you are not willing to take any of 
the T-shirts which you had previously ordered please do send a 
mail stating about your order CANCELLATION. This will atleast give 
me a clear picture as to how many T-shirts should be ordered.

Cheers!!!

Hi,

    Another good location for info on hard disks and partitioning is

Hi,

  In case if u r using system() function inside ur
perl script u cant get the path bcoz. system function
returns the return status of your shell command.  If
the command is successful it returns a zero otherwise
a nonzero value.  U should execute the command using
`(back tick) like this,
 
 $filepaths = `fine /user/prakash -name "ad*"`.

  the above command will redirect the output of the
shell command into the variable.

  Hope this helps.

Regards,
Prakash.

hi,

Here is the script which does what you require....

#!/usr/bin/perl
eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
if $running_under_some_shell;
 
require "find.pl";
 
# Traverse desired filesystems
&find('/');
exit;

sub wanted {
   if (/^monitor$/)
   {
     print "File ->$File::Find::name<-\n";
   }
}

__END__;

There is no magic in it. Actually, this script is
generated by find2perl script. For further details, go
through "perldoc File::Find" and
/usr/lib/perl5/find.pl. I hope this would suffice your
need.

Regards,
Guru Prasad.

Your command returns an array. I suppose you are assigning the result to a 
scalar variable, instead assign to an array variable.

 $x = `shell_command`;
will do the work. 
The quotes ` ` will execute the program and output will be
stored in the variable $x.

Hi Somu,

Thank you for your mail. Please could you let me know more details about
this
Ethernet cable modem? Will Dishnet people give that along with their
connection?
Or we need to buy that? If so what is the approx. cost? Could it be used
with other OSs too? What brand to buy?

I have seen in the list many people reporting Dishnet DSL is not
supported by
Linux (that some driver files weren't available or so...). So I got
confused. Sorry for too many questions but I feel Linux users are
privliged to get support/answers from experts and that is how open
source has been risen upto this level and it's going to take up the IT
scenario to it's boundaries in the days to come.....

Regards,
Franklin

What type of Dishnet connection? If it is commercial they charge around
Rs 5K. They will terminate it at Network card level. then linux will
not have any problem. If it is home they supply Aztech modem which is
supposed to work. I am not able to setup Aztech 100 DSU modem even
though some other driver is supposed to work with it.

Hi,

<? Could someone tell if Dishnet DSL supports Red Hat Linux? ?>

<flame>
Try calling their helpdesk, do not be amazed to find them being clueless about what we talk.
</flame>

If its an usb connect that you have opted for, its going to be hectic, not even trivial. If its a connect using any router ( aztech / te4megabit gear / Lucent,  thats all they have ) its not going to be a trouble.

<? We are going to install a server (Red Hat 7.3) and 6 nodes (win-98). Can we do this networking? ?>
yes you can.

Try the linux box as dhcpd or use squid / oops =)

Why winblows when you can nuxify ?

As said, if its usb, bad luck, else yep you can get it all up and running.

cook book is good only if you have specific questions. It may not
be good idea to start from it. Learning perl is good for starters.
(which is Camel book? Learning perl or programming perl? )

Hi
 this will not work because .the perl interpreter spawns a new shell to
run all ur export commands which will only be available  to the 
sub-shells spawned by ur process.in your case u r trying to access the
variable that is exported in a child from a parent.

It is not possible for a shell script to set environment variables in a
parent process. This is true for any process/program and not just perl
and shell.

In perl, the current environment is stored in the %ENV hash. You can
change your enviromnent by assigining keys/values to this hash.
See perlvar(1).

I have read Programming Perl 2nd and 3rd Ed., the Perl Cookbook, and a
few others (and own some of them too).

IMHO, Programming Perl 3rd Ed (aka the Camel book) is the by far the
most complete resource for Perl (it will be a while before you can out
grow this book). The 3rd Ed has a lot more content than the 2nd Ed and
I highly recommend buying it.

If you do not have any programming experience in any other languages,
you may find Programming Perl daunting. "Learning Perl", by Randal
Schwartz, Tom Christiansen & Larry Wall may be a good option if this is
the case.

Btw, I recently purchased "Object Oriented Perl", Damain Conway, Manning
Press and found it a good read. But you need to be comfortable with Perl
before you can grok this.

Happy reading!

The cookbook is an excellent resource, it provides into other ways of doing 
tasks.

"Learning Pelr" by Randal L. Schwartz is definitely te place for starters

Camel == Programming Perl

  try the perl man pages. they are simple enough to
start with and pretty comprehensive. you can do a lot
of stuff with that alone. Then to progress on from the
baby talk perl try and check out Joseph N Hall's
"Advanced Perl Programming". It gives you a lot of
idiomatic Perl so you can compactify your code and
make it pretty powerful. Anyway for starters try man
perl. Most of the stuff you want is there, and after
playing around for an hour you shold be on your way.
Another good book is the Little Black book of Perl.
That again tells you a lot abt. the language. 

cheers,
Ramesh

hi,

depends on what level of clustering you want to do. for a simple setup,
you can use nfs, nis (to share userid and userfiles) and add mpi (lam) to
give parallel job capability. all these can be selected during normal
installation and when you are done, you will have a beowulf cluster. you
can make the cluster more complex starting from that. at the other
extreme, you can have all (except one) as diskless machines and shared pid
space. you will have to write your code using mpi to get parallel
operation. this is for a beowulf cluster that can run scientific
applications. if your application is oriented otherwise (database,
webserver etc), then i wouldn't know how to go about it...

Message-ID: <200210232125.g9NLOxl22933@mailx1.iitm.ac.in>

 Now, a branded PC for less than Rs 15,000

Our Bureau

NEW DELHI, Oct. 23

YOU can now buy a branded personal computer for under Rs 15,000, 
provided you are not very fastidious about Intel processors and 
Windows Software. Esys Distribution Ltd, a global IT component 
distributor, today launched its `ePC' at prices starting from Rs 
9,990, excluding the monitor.

The ePC is powered by VIA C3 800 MHz Central Processing Unit (CPU) 
and runs the free-cost Linux operating system. With a monitor, the PC 
would cost below Rs 15,000 only, company officials said here.

"This PC is for a totally new segment and we are not competing with 
other branded computers," said Mr Vikas Goel, Chairman and Managing 
Director of the Singapore-based Esys Distribution Group. "We are 
introducing this product as a concept in the market," he said.

Apart from the basic, Internet-ready model, two more versions of the 
ePC are available: One at Rs 11,990 and another at Rs 16,990. Both 
come without monitors.

Hi all,
I' ve a problem on my mail server (Redhat Linux 5.2, MTA:sendmail) that 
outgoing mails are not going to domains like Yahoo.com, Rediffmail.com and 
Hotmail.com only. Other mail services are OK. The mail server is behind a 
firewall and I checked that there is no reule governing this problem. What 
could be the problem? Is there any way to check this?
One more thing, is there any way to activate the mails in the queue to send 
again without shutdown the server?

Thanks in advance

Hi

i have configured a VPN in Redhat 7.3 with ipsec and i give you the
steps

1.get these rpms from www.freeswan.org 
freeswan-1.98b_x509_0.9.15_2.4.18_3-0.i386.rpm        
freeswan-module-1.98b_x509_0.9.15_2.4.18_3-0.i386.rpm  
 
these rpm are prepatched with x509. 

2.install them

3.u need to know u r  u r IP ,default gateway  and IP of the peer and
its default gateway in ipsec terminology thay call this as
ur IP              		--> left/right
ur default gateway 		--> leftnexthop/rightnexthop
ur subnet/internal machines     --> leftsubnet/rightsubnet        

leftsubnet ->left->leftnexthop-(web)-<--rightnexthop<-right<-rightsubnet

right and left are your VPN gateways
the documentation in freeswan is good and exhaustive.
but the following link can help u out.
http://www.caldera.com/support/techsupp/vpn.techsupp.html
there are lots of configuration examples in the above site

try this and do revert back ASAP in case of any issues

There are two worlds 1) free and 2) non-free.  In the `non-free' world
of which SCO is a part  of, sharing or rather lending the distribution
CDs is compared to `boarding a  ship and killing guys'.  They say that
sharing is a crime and copying  is theft.  Why do this and further the
evil of not helping anyone ? 

Enter the  world of Free Software  by using GNU/Linux.   You can learn
and this mailing  list would help you help  yourselves.  Free Software
is about sharing and learning how a program works, do visit

I've looked at a few options a while back and AFAICT OpenAFS
(http://www.openafs.org) seems the most robust, stable and documented.
It is heavy duty and not trivial to use but should work.  I think that
at this point its your best bet.

Coda still seems to be experimental and the one thing it offers over
OpenAFS is disconnected operation.  However, Coda still warns you
saying its experimental.

Hi

Nice to know about low cost PC. However, I have a couple of queries. 
Before hopping on to this new machine, is there any measure / 
study that was done using this machine. I mean as far as machine
performance is concerned, how is it going to be reliable?.. 

We can compare by running a program (that incorporates iterative 
functions/procedures/modules) and comparing the CPU time / Elapsed 
Time with the with the normal Intel / any processor of almost same clock 
speed. That would show up whether this is reliable or not. 

If anybody knows , please throw light on this area so that it could be 
beneficial for people to assess the performance. 

The numbers associated with price seem to be cogent.

Expecting feedback on this!

Thank you

Inviting Enthusiastic volunteers from chennai...

The Demo@Schools project aims at demoing GNU/Linux and other free
softwares to schools in chennai and hence make them adopt free softwares
as a subject in their syllabus. The advantage we have to our side is
that Matriculation Board Schools draft their own syllabi and hence we
see a great opportunity in giving freedom to school children in more
easier ways.

The path you see in your shell needn't be the path 
that glade started with. This can happen if you
have set your path in your bashrc and use xdm/gdm,
then your windowmanager starts with default path
(which is also passed on to glade). 

Check /etc/profile to see whether the path for glade
is included in PATH.

	Anyway, if you read his mail carefully, he said he was willing to pay

	None of which of course, give you a complete OS. He probably wants to
start off with a Linux distro which ships the _kernel_ without which you
have nothing :-)

Subject: [Ilugc] REVIEW: An Indian newsletter on 'software freedom'
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0210252244280.1226-100000@localhost.localdomain>

REVIEW: An Indian newspaper-style newsletter dedicated to 'software freedom'

By Frederick Noronha

DEHRA DUN? Where's that? 

If you're reading this somewhere outside India, you could perhaps not help
wondering where this place is. But Dehra Dun -- a city in the new Indian
province of Uttaranchal, not far from the Indian border with Nepal and China
-- is where the country's first GNU/Linux newspaper-type newsletter comes.

'Software Freedom' (http://www.Software-Freedom.Org) is an eight-page
tabloid. Its first issue has just been released, and editor-publisher Sharad
Kukreti (indiahills at vsnl dot com) was prompt in sending across a copy 

Dehra Dun, literally meaning the camp in the valley, lies in a wooded valley
in the Shiwalik Hills. Tourists see it as a pleasant and relaxing stop on
the way to the hills, known for its mild climate and being a popular
retirement town in North India. 

Priced at one rupee (approx two cents US... it might seem like an
unbelievable price abroad), the publication focuses on an interesting range
of news from the Free/Libre and Open Source Software world. One of its few
adverts announces Kalculate, an Indian product that claims to be the first
financial accounting solution for GNU/Linux in the Asia-Pacific.

Reports comie in from regions as remote and distant as Venezuela to Finland.
In a post-Internet world, this is no big surprise, of course. The news does
travel fast. 

In fact some of this news came up on the Net quite some time back. But this
does not mean that there's no scope for a print-based publication. In
black-and-white, one tends to take it more seriously. Many of the articles
published here brought home their point much more clearly than when read
online. Having a print-based product also helps to share information in an
effective way, in ways which the Net cannot always achieve... despite its
advantages. 

There are updates from overseas (Preu Congressman Dr Edgar David Villaneuva
has become the "darling of the Open Source software community"; want to know
how to break Windows?; some quite-funny GNU/Linux humour... depending which
side of the Free/Proprietory fence you're on; etc). 

But there are also interesting reports from India.

o In the IBM Linux Scholar Challenge, two Indians names figure among the
three internships at IBM for Summer 2002. The three who made it to the top
25 were Shreeram Jaswanth of IIIT (India), Muthukumar of PSG College of
Technology and Sachin Shah of GLS ICTech.

There's still time to register (uptil Oct 31) for this year's Linux Scholar
Challenge.

Contest info: http://www-3.ibm.com/software/info/students/contests/linux/
Complete rules at: http://www-3.ibm.com/software/info/students/pdfs/

o Ganesh Prasad, a self-defined "true capitalist" argues in favour of Open
Source. See http://www.osopinion.com/perl/story/9749.html

o Ajith Kumar BP of New Delhi's Nuclear Science Centre puts forth his idea
for setting up affordable Linux Terminal Server solutions in schools. ks

o The Sir George Everest Research Society has launched FLOSS-related
activities, and claims to be among the first -- if not *the* first -- Indian
society to do so. It promises the "biggest bank" on open source and Free
Software, a wide range of e-books, e-journals and e-research papers. "The
society aims to share its collection so that a big community benefit," they
say. Email: research at soccer dot com

One interesting feature is about how top global firms realise the importance
of Free/Libre and Open Source Software (in whatever shape). Some big names
who have embraced include IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq, SAP, Computer
Associates, Sun Microsystems.

It was really nice to see big names of the Free Software and Open Source
world "stand together" against Microsoft's attempts to discredit this way of
creating software. In fact this was about the best read in the publication.
Perhaps one wonders why it didn't strike one as hard when seen on the
computer screen....

All in all, a useful product. Interesting work. Deserves support... FN

Please read the mail carefully before you flame^Wreply. Ragu isn't
talking of ways of obtaining a free OS.  He is only talking of how
franklin can understand more about what he means by sharing. period.

well, maybe then, raghu should have talked only of gnu and not of
gnu/linux.  if you say gnu/linux, then you should have the courtesy to put
out some linux distro sites and not just gnu sites. or just say gnu and
not gnu/linux. this is what raghu's post had.

According to this (spanish) message, choose the "vesa" driver, when you
do a

	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86

Message-ID: <3DBB8EE8.EE2CDE5B@netshooter.com>

This PC is definately an interesting piece of combination of the available
low-cost hardware and software.
Since it is using the standard Hardware, there is no quetsion about its
efficiency.
It can be seen like this:

What is the normal use of a desktop ? : Office suite (writing letters,
worksheets and some presentation), Browsing, email and some related things
like a messenger etc., Audio and Video players, Games, Grafics-creation and
Accounting package.

All these functions can be easily done by this PC because it has:
1. Fairly good speed CPU (Let's not forget that till the other day,
everyone was using a PI, or a PII for all these things and the software
that did it is still there and working fine.;
2. Reasonable RAM - starter PC is 64MB and then the next one at 128 MB and
then at 256MB - the RAM being standard, can always be upgraded.
Similarily, the rest of the Hardware being  used is very much the standard
Hardware that is available even otherwise in the market and is already
being used by thousnads of users across India apart from other parts of the
worls.

I don't see the resons of having any doubts about its performance.
Yes, if someone wants to insist buying a P-IV for writing letters, it is
his money to burn.

We are heavily promoting LINUX with KALCULATE (http://kalculate.com) and
the response tells us that we are in the right direction.
LINUX actually helps you reduce the cost of PC and this is further reduced
by this kind of Hardware. It is bad that INTEL has stopped producing its
earleir chips (486 onwards rght through to P-II), otherwise even they could
have had a good share of this growing market. But then, good for the users,
companies like VIA are there to offer the necessary hardware.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] running perl
Message-ID: <3DBD5C2F.3050701@qpackets.com>

hi,
       i have replaced a shell script by a perl script.
       Now instead of running the shell script my team mates have to run 
the perl script.

       so, my team mates have to remember whenever they run it that they 
have to
       give the command like

       "perl perl.pl argument[1] argument[2] argument[3]" instead of the

       "shell_script argument[1] argument[2] argument[3]"

       I want to make this transition easy and smooth.......
       so i want to name the perl script same as the shell script and 
execute the command the same way as the shell_script.
      
       i mean i don't want to give "perl perlscript.pl "every time 
rather the old way....
       any suggestions?????

       thanks for ur reply.

You can set the perl path in the header of the file as:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

and then give excecute permissions to the script..Now u can run it as 
<Script_Name> arg1 arg2...

If u donno where perl is u can try 'whereis perl'
or 'which perl' in ksh.

Thanks.

Subject: [Ilugc] MDK9.0 - dhcpcd problem ?
Message-ID: <3DBCB9B4.44EAE056@vsnl.net>

Hello everyone,

    I installed Mandrake 9.0 in 3 machines in our network.  All 3 (let
us call them A, B and C) machines are configured to use dhcp (while
installing itself).  But in 2 machines(B and C), the IP address changes
now and then (nw also restarted).

    In all these 3 machines(A, B and C)  a "ps" shows 2 dhcpcd s running

$ ps -aux |grep dhcp
root       762  0.0  0.0  1292   84 ?        S    10:36   0:00
/sbin/dhcpcd -Y -
root       795  0.0  0.0  1292   88 ?        S    10:36   0:00
/sbin/dhcpcd -Y -
prasanna  2940  0.0  0.4  1672  604 pts/2    S    12:48   0:00 grep dhcp



    In machine A, both the files /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-eth0.info and
/etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-eth0.info.old are same.  That is, they are having the
same IP addresses.

    But in machines B and C, both the above files are having different
IPs - one the current IP and another the IP address that the particular
machine had some 10 minutes back.  Both these machines will alternating
between 2 IP addresses each (one in dhcpcd-eth0.info and other in
dhcpcd-eth0.info.old) until after sometime when suddenly a third IP
appeared.


    The following are few lines from /var/log/dhcpcd.log file:

    In my dhcp server the default lease time is set as follows :

default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;


    It seems like the 2 dhcp clients are competing with each other !

    If I manually kill one of the dhcpcd daemons, then the machine
continues with a single IP until the next reboot.

    Is this problem because 2 dhcpc daemons are started ?  If so, why
are they started twice ?  I just did a default installation.

    Or is also a problem with the dhcp server - since it gives 2 or 3
different IP to the same MAC address.

*****

    Now, about machine A.

    It is also 2 dhcpcd daemons.  The dhcp server's logs shows that 2
request come at a second's interval (but the same IP -192.168.2.20 is
assigned both the time).

00:01:02:93:00:10 via eth0

    Anyway, the damage is done since network is also restarted sometime
when the alternate dhcp clients take control.


    Someone, please kindly throw some light on this problem.  This kind
of problem didn't happen for any machine/OS before.

regards,
Prasanna David

General Info: The first line #! interpreter directive is called
"She-Bang". 

A portable way of writing this instead of hardcoding your interpreter's
path is:

#! /usr/bin/env perl

env will execute the first binary matching the argument in the PATH
variable. This means if you have two versions of perl (say, one in
/usr/bin and one in /usr/local/bin) all that you need to do is change
the PATH environment variable instead of changing each and every
script's shebang.

Hi all,
I have win2k on hda and RH 7.0 on hdc, sometimes i get the error "hdc:unable to find interrupt" when linux boots other times, linux just hangs!!!. 
I tried changing the interface cables but i still ended up getting this message. 

Is it because my hdc is a 4 year old 4 GB disk? can this sort of problem occur if the hard-disk isnt okay?

Cheers,
Venkat

Running perl:

1) perl some_program.pl (as Bharti said put #!/usr/bin/perl -w as ur 
first line, infact this should be the there always)
2) if ur perl program is an executable u can run the perl program like this:
    ./some_program.pl

The switch "-w" enables the warnings.

one solution i can offer Sivanandam

1) in your shell script put the line for perl some thing like this:
    your_shell.sh
   
    #!/bin/sh
         perl urperl_prg.pl arg[1] arg[2] arg[3]

here u can directly run the shell script the shell script will in turn 
run the perl program

your_shell.sh arg[1] arg[2] arg[3]

Hope this is what u want.

Hi,
   Are you using mod_ssl? If yess pls visit www.cert.org.
    You can check /tmp directory carefully with hidden files.

Yes of course it is possible to come in thru the http port. There was a recent buffer overflow exploit for Apache which was released (i think by cert, check em up). 
It is also possible to attack other servers thru this server, but again it depends on the attacker knowing your n/w architecture. I guess it would not be very difficult to guess something like that, but if you are securing your data server then the chances could be minimal.
If you are looking at some strange text then the first place to start would be the apache logs. check em up. May be u can sanitize the IPs and post a snapshot of the logs. Ppl might help you out.

Subject: [Ilugc] routing in Red Hat 7.3
Message-ID: <3DBE2940.6B37CA24@ncoretech.com>

Hi,

I am trying to connect a remote system onto a network through PPP.  I
can establish the PPP interface from the remote system (with ip address
x.x.x.90) to the Linux box (with ip address x.x.x.130) on the network.
>From the
remote system, I am able to ping the linux system (x.x.x.130) but not
any other
system on the network.

I had this working when I had my Linux system running on Red Hat 7.1
(and it still does on machines with RH 7.1) , where I had to just enable
routing
(using the netconf utility).  Unfortunately, the netconf utility on 7.3
doesn't have
options to enable routing. How do I enable routing on a 7.3 machine?

Thanks in advance,
Regards,
Kanagesh.

Dear Fellow LUG Coordinator,

Greetings from the Bangalore Linux User Group!

Last year, the BLUG had organised India's first national level Linux and
OpenSource event, with stupendous success. Have a look at
http://linux-bangalore/2001 to get a taste of how it went.

This year, we are back again!

Linux-Bangalore/2002 is a three day conference on understanding and using
Linux and OpenSource technologies, to be held on December 3, 4 & 5 2002 at
Bangalore. 

This is a one of a kind annual Linux event held in India and we would like
to invite you and the members of your LUG to participate in this event as
delegates and (if possible) as speakers as well.

Detailed Information on how to participate as well as  news and updates can
be found on our website for the event at http://linux-bangalore.org/2002/

We have a mailing list where you can give your views/inputs about the
event and it also allows for interaction amongst the various participants
and the organisers. linux-bangalore-2002@yahoogroups.com (Subscription
instructions at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/linux-bangalore-2002/)

This is a community driven event and we would *really* appreciate it if the
members of your LUG would participate in the discussions and (if possible)
at the event itself.

Please forward this note to your members via your mailing list.

Looking forward to your LUG's participation in the event.

With warm regards,

Kingsly John
Coordinator
Bangalore Linux User Group

As some of you might have noticed the section of the website listing other
LUGs is totally broken and mostly contains outdated information.

I'm compiling a database of LUGs in india and contact information and
websites etc.(I have some of the popular LUGs info already) but would
appreciate it if you could mail the details of your LUG to kingslyj@vsnl.net 
with subject line containing "[LUG-Details]" (Just replying to this mail
should be sufficient unless SF chomps out my Reply-To setting.)

And with your responses to the form below.

One all the details are received I'll put them up for public access and the
website maintainer can update the details on the LI site.(What happened to
the planned website update by the new maintainer ??)

No updates to the site as Kingsly pointed out :(

So, who's next in the queue to be nominated webmaster of
Linux-India.org and subsequently shot, vilified and flamed?  (Don't
worry, you'll be shot, etc even if you do a wonderful job -- that's
the job description).

If you have ideas of what to do with the site, the energy and skill to
do it and enough experience in maintaining web sites, please send your
CV (<g>) to me in PRIVATE e-mail.

Thanks,

hello there,

        i switched over to the gnu-linux platform only a coupla months
back... now i want to go in for some new extra stuff for my comp...ie... a
cd-writer and a printer...but i have my doubts of whether these devices do
function as well as they do in windoze... or do i get a set of drivers from
the manufacturer, so that i dont have to run around in the net to download
them all...

        and... it wud be nice if someone who is already using these(most of
u) can let me into the intricacies of the trade, just tell me what i shud
look for... btw, how about the samsung and sony cd-writers, do they come
along with drivers for linux, or shud we hunt them down...

        and what other feature shud i look out for, comparing cost wise,
most of them seem to differ only by a marginal sum... so tis the
"linuxability" of the devices that am looking for...
pls help...
cheers...

Sure, they do.  The fun is  the freedom to experiment and learn, maybe
at the cost of a couple of coasters.

Would recommend if you could get  Sony instead of Samsung.  Get an IDE
interface writer, some of the USB models are yet to see drivers in the
Linux  kernel.   I  have this  IDE  Acer  drive  which is  doing  very
well. You can think of buying a Plextor or Lite-On writer.  You can do
some digging at these links,

Agenda for the Next( Nov 9th 2002) Month Meet:

Title    : Intrusion Detection With Linux - An Introduction  

Date     : 9th Nov 2002 (Sat)

Time     : 3.15PM - 4.00PM

Venue    : Aerospace Dept, IIT-Madras.

Speaker  : Mr. R Deepak, M.S, DON Lab, CSE Dept, IIT-Madras.

Abstract :

With the current state of networks, security becomes a very important
thing. There are many aspects to network security. One such thing is
"Intrusion Detection".
 
However well a network is secured, and however well it is maintained, it
will definitely be compromised if we are offering any services. The only
way to guard against this is to detect the attack in real-time and deal
with it when it is happening. We will be looking at ways of doing this.

The Free Software Movement as we know it was founded in 1985 by 
Richard M. Stallman.  The basic tenets of free software are -- 
freedom to study, freedom to change, freedom to share or 
distribute, the right to sell free software, and the principle 
that the software 'source' has always to accompany binaries.

Nothing much:

   1. Attend every possible ILUGC meet
	2. take attendance
	3. Write minutes (and include the head count in your minutes)
	4. Update the meetings.php page (well, pure HTML work now)
	5. update a file which appears on the right of every page containing
	a link to your minutes
	
	and finally, before each meet update the same file to reflect each
	meetings's agenda.

	Pros:

	 * You get to learn a lot
	 * You have a better chance of actively participating in ILUGC's
	   activities

	Cons:
	 * Minutes writing is, ughh... well... wont seem time consuming if
	   you enjoy it :)
	 * You'll get a lot of spam from spammers

	 Overall, its worth taking it up :) please come up with a response.

hi,
thx for the info. Are you in chennai by any chance? 
Maybe I could pick up the cd or make a copy of it, if
its ok with you?

We had problems with 7.2 when we tried it out for a
class. Had to do reinstall few times thanks to
x-server
crashin. used 7.0 before but did not have much
problems. did crash the x part few times but not as
much as on 7.2.

I did not apply any patches. other thing is the
package manager. applyin third party packages was bit
difficult. dependencies was bit difficult. had to
install each one and then the sub-dependency

maybe I  was doin something wrong. 

Thanks,
Sanjay Chigurupati

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10210311921380.29584-100000@peacock.iitm.ernet.in>

Hi,

I had recently installed RH 8.0 on my home machine (P-II 336 with 160MB
RAM). This was a fresh install (Though I had 7.3 previously, i had to
overwrite it because of a lot of small problems that kept cropping up).
Initial impression of RH8 - Very Good. 

Lot of work has gone into the GUI. The new look GUI looks clean, with neat
icons. The programs are arranged
into neat logical groups. Another good thing probably is the integrated
interface provided both in GNOME and KDE. This is due to BLUECURVE,
RedHat's UI initiative. The menus appear in the same order and sport the
same captions in both. "CD Player" in Gnome starts GnoCD while in KDE, it
starts KonCD. 

Another cause for cheer is the integrated administration tools that come
under the redhat-admin-* and redhat-config-* banners. The old commands
still work though! Configuring
the system is now an easy task even for beginners. Just click at the right
tool in the menu and ur into it. No need to remember "printtool" for
configuring ur printer etc. However, Iam still a great fan of yast2. RH
will have to pull up its socks to match yast2 in terms of pure ease of use
and its functionality.

The package manager has also been integrated now. The packages are grouped
logically into
different categories and easy hints come up to say what each package does.
On the downside, though, your flexibility for choosing individual packages
is now gone. You select a group, and thats it. All the *requisite*
packages for that group will be installed. This shows up during the
installation itself, where you dont have to worry about cryptic package
names. Package selection at installation is now a peaceful affair, however
managing individual packages cannot be done from the GUI. The RPM command
line is there, though!

On the flipside, the full installation is a Whopping 4.5 GB!! After having
installed all these packages, the system ought to be slow, and it is! But
I found it a bit faster than the RHL 7.3 that was previously installed on
the same machine. I have not checked the package manager that much. I am
not sure how adding new packages would be. If they had an easy way of
automatically downloading and installing packeages to resolve dependencies
(like in woody), it would be nice. Have to check it out though.

Legacy sound card configuration seems to be a problem. My Yamaha OPL-SAX3
sound card wasnt properly detected, both by RH's new Sound Card
configurator program, and also by sndconfig(!surprise!). Had to manually
change
/etc/modules.conf to load the correct driver for the sound card. Also, MP3
support has been pulled out of XMMS due to some vague copyright reason! :(
One can download the MPG123 plugin for XMMS to play MP3's though!! Also,
Netscape is gone, Mozilla is in (good news for some!). Evolution is in,
along with a whole lot of goodies like gaim, galeon etc. No wonder the
full install takes so much space!

Final verdict:

Slick, fast GUI, more *non-geek* oriented. Could appeal to general junta.
Good set of administration tools, but yet to match up with the rest.
Package management leaves much to be desired (A package policy on the
lines of Debian is in the works???). Otherwise good old linux kernel with
the latest releases of all other goodies to go along with it, slickly
packaged! Are we seeing Linux slowly going the way of Windows?

Anyway, GO FOR IT!!

Hi there,

	Would just like to add one more thing :
	
	The entire release has been compiled using the new and improved gcc
3.22 which means that the binaries are better optimized and therefore
faster :-)


	Regards,

		Ravi

Hi,
I am not sure but I thought I saw an article that said
that APT could be added to RedHat and there was also
contribution for third party from FreshRPMS. 

I found the article while doing a google search. This
had to do with rpm manager. I did not read the article
completely and cant provide any more details.

Try apt-get. Its a front end to the rpm package manager and is quite 
powerful.

Indeed, apt-get is a powerful tool originally written for the debian
project. apt4rpm was ported for the connectiva project and is seen to be
used by a variety of other distros. good that RPM-based distros aren't
as handicapped as they used to be :P
