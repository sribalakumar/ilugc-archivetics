Sorry, the software I am talking about is still alive on MainFrames. 
Infact FOCUS was/is the First database to run on PC/AT with 640KB RAM

and also on Mainframe. Tilldate I have not found better reporting

Rajendran/Riyaz-

Its possible to develop free software (free as in freedom) and make
money, afterall MySQL, MandrakeSoft, Trolltech and quite a few companies
do this through their dual licensing scheme.  Go through their web site
and find out how!

If we take something from the community, we should give something back
in return, thats what the GPL is all about.  It enforces it!

Hai friends,

No i just don't flame Mr.Sriram. May be my single line mail,made to think
you so.If you think its flaming, let this mail be in lighter tone.

Mr.Sriram or anyone has every right and freedom to think or to become a
billionare or even to become a Bill Gates. Our government has given that
right and freedom to do so. I just wonder whether he or anyone will get
the same amount or atleast half of that rights and freedom under
Microsoft. Even if he or anyone become a billionare by developing a
software product with microsoft technology, he or anyone would still be
under the discretion and grace of Microsoft.

If anyone creates an innovative technology with microsoft, which if
microsoft thinks that it will improve their domination, either his one
will be bought or will be stolen by sheer arrogance and let your
technology become obsolete. Been said against microsoft, i am still not
against proprietry softwares and i know the importance to the economy of
the country.

I don't want to become a linus or RMS, but still their creations
(softwares, not particularly linux) allows to me become another one like
them. I am not against Microsoft, but only against their attitudes.

I am in this group not just because linux or some thing is
opensource(this is secondary thing to me). Primarily i am here for some
of the following reasons:

1. I felt Microsoft really needs a good competitor, which could not be
destroyed by any means(IP or any marketing tactics) or should not become
obsolete by itself(either it has no supporters or there is no money or
ideas to further improve it). I find Linux as good one. Only this kind of
competition can make a product better. Look at what happened to Internet
Explorer,it didn't have any feature improvement for the past five years.
Suddenly there is an announcement that they will introduce new features
in the next version, like tabbed browsing, pop-up blocking and an option
to uninstall plugins. I think this is possible only when there is a
competition(though the market share for other browsers were negligible).
I don't like microsoft to have monopoly in software market.

2. Second thing is i am here beacuse, i am concerned with the softwares
like linux which has some importance to the society and also importantant
for the country like ours.

The business model dosent work like that. You make a program., you
sell it for any price (even a million)  or give away free of
charge. You promise to give support either in the form of programming
or hand-holding for a price. this is how money should be made in `Free
Software development'. The income made by selling software is not a
primary/only means of making money with software. You can provide
service for you. 

When you develop a software and sell it for Rs.100 along with basic
support., if another person sells it for Rs90., the support provided
varies. If the required support is to add a customisation to the
software, definitely you can do it better than your competitor because
you are the author.

Cheers,
Joe

The license is not flawed. It protects the social freedom of a person
who _values_ it.

So, if I write software SO GOOD that it doesn't need support at all,
OR
if I write software, get done with it, and move on onto a different product,
closing the previous one down, or onto a different field itself like
beekeeping or horticulture,

this funda doesn't work at all, then.

Right?

The license is not flawed. It protects the social freedom of a person
who _values_ it.

On examining our server, I found /var/log/apache/error.log belonged to the
group "adm".
What does that group refer to.

Suppose if the scrips (PHP, ..) want write access to certain location, to
which group-id should I chgrp that location?  Is it "adm"
I never see groups "apache" and "httpd" in /etc/group

M$ is interested in Rotor/xyz/* .NET implementation just because it is
its creation. These communities that you talk of are driven by
M$. So., basically these communities you talk of are nothing but
marketing playgrounds for M$. 

OK., I dont know anything about .NET. But i've seen a fraction of how
this community of your's is being driven by M$ and other related
corporates. Definitely, the community will not survive until there is
something like this., coz.. the monopoly is not the community but the
corporate driving the community.

Joe

Well., its true that the desktop themes of today are targetted more
towards making the GNU/Linux desktop look more like a XP desktop. But
that was not the motive when `X' came around. The Mac people thought
of graphics and pointing devices first. They brought it to the
desktops. The UNIXers wanted a graphical frontend to communicate with
the UNIX servers., and the `X window' project came up. The design of
the GUI on Mac and on `X-Window' are totally different. May be we can
say that the UNIXers got inspired to use GUI after seeing the Mac
desktops. But the implementation ideas were totally different. Its
like pizza and burger. Both are fast food. but definitely not the
same. 

Cheers,
Joe

What abt the users who are stuck with your software and don't have enough
money to upgrade to a different software? Atleast if it were OSS then 
somebody
else can continue development on your software once you have moved to 
horticulture.
As long as you were in the business you were able to earn and give service 
to users.
Once you are out someone else can continue the good work.

>So, if I write software SO GOOD that it doesn't need support at all,
Replacement of damaged CD's?
New hardware(there will always be new hardware)? 
Enhancements?
Support does not mean just helping to install and use the software.

One more thing, no 'Business Model' works if the company isn't a 'Going 
Concern', ie, if
it is known that it is short-lived. In other words, you can't technically 
apply the term
'Business Model' if you already plan to close down after writing the "SO 
GOOD" super cool
software.

If we approach the software freedom purely on commercial grounds it
will be difficult to digest the freedom aspect. But since, software
has far greater role in our life, we need to take broad look and
realise the advantages of Free Software.

Look into

http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html

to see the total perspective of software freedom.

Hey Ram, (both an address and an exasperation!)
You didn't get me first time...

I am talking about OSS only.

>>>>>>What abt the users who are stuck with your software and don't have
enough
>>>>>>money to upgrade to a different software? Atleast if it were OSS then
>>>>>>somebody else can continue development on your software once you have

If I can't make money from the OSS I develop, I might be FORCED to go
beekeeping, like Sherlock Holmes...

>>>>>>One more thing, no 'Business Model' works if the company isn't a

>>>>>>Concern', ie, if it is known that it is short-lived. In other words,

>>>>>>apply the term

It is NOT NECESSARY, though useful, for a company to promise
forever-existence. Borland was a good company. Starfish was too. So, just
because Philippe Kahn (wasn't that his name?) did that twice, will I lose
trust in him?

Hey, let me restate my question ya.

I love the Open Source Spirit of community development, I would like to make
a living SOLELY OUT OF IT, for I think that is as ethical as it gets, and as
clean as it gets. I am afraid though, that I can NEVER SELL software and
make REASONABLE money. You talk of hardware-support and stuff like
enhancements. But, what if my software doesn't even use much hardware other
than the core processor, which anyway is mostly backward-comp nowadays, and
what if I don't intend to do any enhancements to my product/tool unless I
make some money for its current status? I really don't get it guys. Please
help me.

Rajendran.

Point well taken. But I only fear that we play around with words so much
these days that "will be difficult to digest" is actually a euphemistic way
of saying "is impossible to digest". :-(

blogs, etc...  I even saw xhp.sf.net, but it is not mature.

See, See, See you again talk about "protecting the customer" using the GPL.
Man, I am talking about ensuring the survival of the vendor too! (Even the
Graboid was protected by extinction-prevention-laws! Check out:-
http://www.movietome.com/movietome/servlet/MovieMain/movieid-25956/Tremors_3
_Back_to_Perfection/ )

Is it that I don't know how to ask this question, or that you guys don't get
my question, or that there is no proper answer to it??

I rephrase my question here:-
Can I or can I not SELL (for a nonzero price), software (and not
support/service over that), to a customer, along with sourcecode (basically
opensource it), without fear that today's customer will turn tomorrow's
competitor by just repackaging my stuff for a lower price?

Don't send me URLs, don't talk about philosophy, don't tell me it is not
about the money. Just tell me, Yes, or No, and if Yes, give me the name of
that company. I want to work for it, or better, emulate it (or even better,
outsell her to extinction).

Rajendran.

  This GPL license is there precisely to protect this kind of action. You
make a software and sell it to a customer at a big price. Later when the
customer faces problems and approaches you - and you say you just dumped the
project and wont support it anymore.
  GPL is there to see that the customer isnt at the mercy of software
creator.


  The other thing is that there is no "software SO GOOD that it doesn't need
support at all".

Essentially whole business model should from 'selling product' to
'providing service'. Actually software should not be considered like
any other physical product.

We better think the way professionals like Architect,Auditors,civil
engineers do. All the services(or product) are there for all to see
and copy, improve. Still, these professions thrive well.

If we take Proprietory Software companies as role model and try to
fit that model in Opensource, it may not work.

Dear Raman,
Architects, Auditors, Civil Engineers, Great analogy, but wrong placement,
in my humble opinion.

Mckenzie, Accenture, PriceWaterhouse, provide services, only, too.
Ask them to open out their Body-of-Knowledge.

Or, like Suresh recently asked, ask Pepsi/Coke to out with their formula.
After all, it is in the mixing, ain't it?

At the same time, as an aside, even if I videotape my mom cook (what is it
with programmers and their moms? They seem to draw her out of the kitchen
way too often!!) and try the same dish the next day, I don't think I will
get it... But, then, even if SHE tried the same dish the next day, it
mightn't be as good (only better?).

Rajendran.

Look at what MySQL, Trolltech and other companies do, they have a dual
licensing scheme whereby they make money!
>From MySQL.com web site:

Why does MySQL offer two licenses?
...
The dual licensing creates a circle that sustains both innovation and
growth: MySQL channels the revenue from this viable open source business
model back into support for its open source user community that, in
turn, supports MySQL AB's commercial business.
...

There are quite a number of links if you do some "googling" for "open
source business models"--read them.

Software can be copied (not manufactured) for zero cost.  Hence, if you
were to sell it like proprietory software, you can make money at the
extreme.  But... wait ..., you were making money without input (except for
the initial effor).  Yes.  You wrote the software once.  You incurred a
cost for that.  You fixed a price for that software.  Now you are starting
to sell it `n` times.  Here `n` tends to infinity, and you get prize X n
== infinite amount of money for the software you wrote once.
When talking about SERVICE, you can definitely make money.  And that
software may not be a general purpose one.  You write software for a
particular customer, who needs the software to suit his own specific
needs.  You are servicing him, and you are getting money.
But coming to PRODUCT development, you may make money, but still that can
be made only by providing support.  Look at MySQL, Evolution for example.
Hope that helps.

Note: In Microsoft world, things go differently (opposite).  They develop
products and sell them repeatedly but with poor support (no flames please,
first do googling)

Anybody else can acquire knowledge like them. After all knowledge in
Business world is available openly. Essentially it is the quality of
manpower you recurit.

As long as you see software as physical product, it will not be
possible to openup. If you start looking it as knowledge to be shared
  then things change. We start thinking like the professions you
don't want to be compared to.

This is fundamental beauty of software. You can replicate it without
loss of originality any number of times and more importantly at
nearly zero cost. You can enhance it from where it is without
restarting from scratch. That's why do not consider/equate it with
physical products. Shift focus to service away from 'selling product'
model.

A possible response to the answer....

Assume, after seventeen years of Zen meditation, I come up with a neat
little clay-cast that will take clay as input and give a beautiful Buddha
statue as output.

Now, my question:-
I would like to go opensource by letting the world know the inner design of
the claycast, because I like the concept of no-patent and
free-knowledge-sharing.
Dumping the clay in, and getting the statue out is negligible in both time
and effort.
So, can I charge for my clay-statue-making, given that I have publicized the
inner design of the claycast?

Answers please?

Rajendran.

While what you say it is the Undeniable Negropontian Truth, I fail to see
the beauty as well as you do.
Probably, it will grow on me, but not yet.

I feel that is the fundamental reason why software piracy is rampant, a
video CD of even the yet-to-be-released "Passion of the Christ" is available
on the roadside for 50 bucks, and no training company in Chennai that I know
of (correct me if wrong) ever has original legal purchased copies (what an
oxymoronic name!) of BEA Weblogic or Cognos datawarehousing software.

    X does Y.  X is human and Y is action.  X cannot claim for money for
    each Y he/she does.  He can do a subset of Y in order to get money.    You can innovate.  You can become popular, hence.  But it doesn't make
    sense to ask for money for that innovation.  As I said before, service
    your customer and they will pay you.    As a general principle, by going ILLEGAL, one can get lot of wealth. 
    But the amount of wealth he gains will be limited in a legal path,
    though he may gain good feelings by GOD.  But it should be still
    enough for him.  (Now, you may come to know why Mr. Gates is the
    richest person in the World).
Is that a possible answer for your question?

Another divine answer:
Time is divided into four stages ... and we are in the fourth stage .. In
the fourth stage man do many sins, in the first stage, everyone is
considered to be GOD. It is believed that GOD will one day bring back us
to the first stage from this dirty fourth stage.I consider Free Software Founders as a descendents of GOD.  They were born
to notify us that this transition may not be so far.

Provide service, support.  Write Free Software.  Enjoy your life?  Why
think about Mr. Gates?

Hmm.. support is not just setting up things for running., it is also
setting up things to show a good performance. Now., no matter how good
the software is., when it reaches the market.. it hits a wide variety
of people. In that case, each one looks at the software at a different
perspective. Hence there is no way to make software which dosent need
support.

In that case., it simply means you dont want to make money with
software.. that you are not interested in it anymore. 

Cheers,
Joe

"paste"d. Tried but no luck, on KDE running on Knoppix/Debian.

b) Which is the best GUI (okay, there is nothing called the best, I hear you

learn that well. (Learn a GUI?? Yeah, unlike Windows, I already see the
Linux GUIs oozing with power and productivity-boosts if only you know how to

c) If you don't want me to waste your time with questions like a and b,
answer d at least.

d) Is there a website for Linux-Newbies (particularly winusers in previous

Thanks in advance.

The coolest  thing (cool for the software  :) maybe not you  :) ) with
open  source/free software is  that the  software becomes  better even
without your  (your == the  author of the software)  knowing.  Someone
might  have added a  performance enhancement  fix. Someone  might have
added a nice new feature that the author never thought about.

BUT, there will as well be someone who *wants* a new feature. That new
feature  might not be  a part  of the  roadmap that  you plan  for the
software you write.  But if he  badly needs it written, he will pay it
and get it done.

Most such LAMP  related work in India happens  this way. Someone wants
to have  a CMS for their  company's whatever.  If they  are happy with
merely a drupal,  well and good for them. but when  they are not, they
either come to a "professional"  open source software company that can
hack drupal to  work the way they  want it. OR they can  simply hire a
free lancer.

Its more like plumbing your water supply system. :) Just because every
other non-open-source comapny makes a  hell a lot of cash, dont assume
your open source business should do the same as well. 

cheers,

  -Suraj

As per the README file, kernel image `bzImage` will be found in
arch/i386/boot/bzImage (or somesuch) directory.  Just copy it into any
directory (prefereably /boot) and configure lilo/grub to use it.
simply read the REAME file given in kernel source tree completely

   More advanced solution.Use GIMP.  From their you can chose.
   File->Acquire->*

   (Or)

   Simple solution. If you are running GNOME, try Action->Screenshot.

   Most people prefer KDE, but it is bloated and a memory hog (though I
   heared KDE 3.2 is better in performance).  For me (who is a developer)
   GNOME is really a better desktop.  If you (in future) want to develop
   linux applications, then you may find GTK+/GNOME libraries a lot more
   better option than QT/KDE.  So choose your desktop by considering all
   the options.

   Atleast for you first question, Google can answer, why not try it?  I'm
   quite sure that you may end with lot more results than posting it in
   mailinglists.

  Checkout the desktop websites
   http://gnome.org http://gnomedesktop.org
   http://kde.org
   google for x window managers

  And the most important one
   http://tldp.org (The Linux documentation project)

   Use IRC (XChat)
   http://www.linuxquestions.org/
   http://www.google.com/search?q=linux+newbies

  At last,
   http://google.com/linux

  If you want you can get Mandrake 10.0 - 3 CDs from me.

You can go for 'snapshot', which is a tool to take screen shot of
entire screen or a particular window.

If you are using GNOME, you can use 'print screen' key as in
windows.

All the GUI's are best and it is in the point of view and usage.
You just try the different GUIs and take the useful and
convenient one for you.

Again., this depends on taste. People migrating for Windoez find KDE
to be easy to adapt to. However, the desktop is totally a matter of
taste. 

I personally have a unreasonable liking towards GNOME.

  I didn't say that writing proprietary software is illegal (either
  implicitly or explicitly).  May be I was (somewhat) going offtopic.

   Sorry, Neither RMS, nor Linus is considered to be GOD or like.
   The term I used when talking about GOD refer to only GOD.
   (May be descendents of GOD should have been replaced with appropriate
   phrase - in fact if we considered that way all of us are descendents of

You can use gimp also. Use File->acquire->screenshot.

Hi,

Did anybody come across PostNuke and PHPNuke.  We are planning to setup a
portal for our department of CS at CEG.  PostNuke is being talked about
security.  From the PHPNuke-howto, it seems like PHPNuke people claim that
they are not second to PostNuke in anyway.  Did anybody tried them?  Which
one of them seems to be most appropriate for you?

You make software:

Hallo luggians,
      Sorry guys, I`m just resending my second post to
the Are you serious thread, as it came out in HTML
from Rediffmail. I`ve just added myself to Yahoo. But
kindly reply to: sudharsan@rediffmail.com

That is what is changing!! I mean that 'percentage'!!

>you want your bootloader on your MBR? 

The question of installing the bootloader in the MBR
is for people like us who wud want a better
organization of our hard disks and not for our moms
who wud want to get simple jobs done. Your mom wud
obviously be worried abt operating it after its is
being loaded and not abt how partitioning being done.
If you leave ur mom with a fresh hard disk and a
windows CD same wud be the case!! Considering it`s a
fresh hard disk and a Linux distro it is very much the
same.

The problem comes only when there is an exisiting
windows platform and u install Linux on the free space
u have, and once again ur mom wud have to be worried
only abt working on the OS than trying to install the
boot loader. Well, I`d presume u cud install it for
her!! Any user like ur mom or even my mom wud only be
worried how simple the OS works and once you/me going
to teach her it doesnt really make a difference
between windows and linux. 

Trying to say she is going to find Windows easier and
Linux worser, makes a difference if u r going to teach
her Linux.  As for her experience, if ur going to
start with the basics, trying to explain things on how
to work - it doesn`t really make a difference and
trying to say windows wud be 'superior' is not to be
assumed. As I very clearly said the availability of
code does not matter and the ease-of-use point is also
not to be taken considering the visual interfaces in
both make it simple. You cud have showed me earlier
Linux versions but presently the thing that really
drives Linux distros is not all these OSS stuff
entirely......they r really focussing on making it
really simpler and they have made it really simple
than what it used to be.

>BTW, I'm not the only one ranting about poor

Trying to say UIs are bad in all OSS is a spurious
argument in itself. It all depends upon the user, and
present day if u consider proprietary Windows and OSS
Linux the UI does not differ to the 'bad' extent.
Your ranting isnt going to make a difference in the
quality of the UIs. CUIs are amazing in UNIX/Linux and
hardcore programmers know that better.

If you try to compare the CUI MS-Dos with UNIX/Linux,
ur joking!! When it comes to GUIs there isn`t a big
difference!! GUI is a concept and a technology in
itself and trying to say that GUIs in OSS are 'bad'
very well applies to Windows which also believes that
GUI is the best thing promoting it`s 'quality'. Trying
to compare two OSs on the same technology of GUI and
saying one is 'bad' isn`t a healthy argument in
itself.


>The day the OSS community

As I had said above when it comes to CUIs, try to
conduct a honest survey amidst programmers, the CUIs
in Unix/Linux are the best. When u talk abt GUIs - Pls
read the previous paragraph abt the concept of GUIs.
When trying to compare CUIs the OSS community has
hardly had a threat from MS and I doubt if they have
ever considered MS as a so-called 'threat'. When
talking abt GUIs, that was what stood between Unix
entering personal desktops - Anyway, Linux made the
difference.

I have very clearly mentioned only one statement
talking abt costs and I didn`t go too much into it.
But there was one more post in the group abt trying to
migrate to some other hardware just to run ur OS and
getting the best out of existing hardware. The factors
involving hardware use in MS and Linux is very clearly
elucidated there. Kindly refer to that, it has been
CCed to you too!!

>If OSS says that all their software has to be

>would run away screaming.

Let`s take the example of charges for certain editions
of Linux. The distros too do not charge for the OS but
for tech support and the service charges. Try
downloading all programmes required to run Linux and
try compiling and executing them to be written onto
the boot loader. What the distros do is do that work
for you and provide tech support.

I think IBM and Sun know better abt this than both of
us do - They r talking abt freedom to tweak with ur
code and not free, like the bit notices we get when
going to Home-Life exhibitions. They are not giving
free(as in beer and bit notices) distributions but
free(as in sspeech) distributions.

My argument abt 'giving everything' was in reply to
your statement abt the 'wealth of documentation in
MSDN' and not abt 'problem at hand' stuff. Freedom is
what is the maximum you can do as a programmer and not
the maximum you can do with .NET alone. You feel
having the source code as an Engineer it`s a luxury
but the whole of the OSS community and even the
programming world wud consider it as a requirement.

This is the easiest thing anybody can do!! The whole
point is abt doing things by yourself, if you can. An
engineer is a person who does things by himself in the
truest sense with integrity. "Trade secrets",etc, come
later.

By debugging other`s code u can see what`s essentially
wrong, what is right, what can be done!!

Anyway OSS programmer are not debuggers. They dont get
error reports and debug their previous versions and 
re-release them under a new 'jilpans' name. 

All people in the OSS community are rightly credited
and they r as famous as the tool they have developed
or contributed to. They get their due share of name
and fame and r not unpaid programmers. They get their
share of fame and are paid well. 

Getting ur shiny new car is about being able to
contribute so much to create an improvisation so that
u get ur car faster than an OSS programmer. Everybody
is going to get a car anyway, being able to do it fast
is what is required(unless otherwise). 

Kernel developers(debuggers, as u wud call them as)
can get themselves shiny new cars faster than most
others. If u can do something radical enough to be
called a 'contribution' send it to the OSS community,
u will get ur name-fame and if it`s good enough - ur
shiny new car. It is ur skill that will get u
anywhere!!

> Hobbyist programming we all do and enjoy...but in
the end,
>it's not viable as a full time profession(unless

>or RMS). 

OSS programmer are not people in Tirumala Tirupathi
Devasthanam who do honorary work - they r very much
programmers who program every day for their daily
bread. Linus and RMS aren`t the only ones who r paid,
people working on OSS projects are well paid. As u
said hobby programmers, need not be paid, but will get
their due credit. 

Linus was very much like that - he didnt develop an OS
because somebody was waiting with keys to a shiny new
car or to appear in TIME magazine cover, or to counter
MS. But that became his profession of releasing
kernels and trying pack more punch into his OS.

What r they going to do with the several TBs of errors
resulting due to OS problems? Trying to say Win is
error-free wud be a big joke!! Linux handles almost
all such things u have mentioned with a simple msg
which prevents u from carrying on further than let the
whole platform on which all the applications r resting
to crash and having to do the 'holy' act of restarting
the system.

The outcome of the race will be determined by how well
we know our operating systems than the OS in itself.
If I lose it does not mean Linux is hopeless or vice
versa - it will just show that we have not been able
to use our OS effectively. Well, dont talk abt
hardware meant for proprietary Windows that  take time
to get working in Linux with additional plugins!! If
ur talking abt Linux/Windows compatible hardware I
only see myself restarting services and running Kudzu
and then than restarting the whole system one million
times!!

Anyway we can have a race, maybe I can get my job done
before restarting ur system, and as I had said not
with hardwares which provide windows compatibility CD.

> Or is it unthinkable that Linux users will
>want to listen to music and see pictures that they

Haven`t u heard of XMMS with mp3 plugin and the
so-many picture seeing and processing tools in Linux?

Source code. In fact,

Well universities have them, fine!!What abt you and
me, the programming community? The Godforsaken code
had to be leaked and not given out fairly to the
programming community. This seems to prove the point.

>My original argument was that you don't need access
to source code to be
>efficient or to innovate 

When I say innovation I very specifically mean what
lies beyond the available domain. What can you do with
Windows if u want to add a feature to it? What can u
do with .NET if u want to add a functionality to it?
Mail Bill gates?? I`m not talking abt implementing
what lies within your maximum limits such as .NET
dcomunentation or MSDN which might help you add new
things. But let`s say u have a new concept which u
might atleast try to implement, u cant even try that
in MS. MS talks about the dome of St.Paul`s cathedral
and says u can do anything in it, but I`m talking abt
the world that lies outside St.Paul`s dome. You r
fascinated by the biggest dome, but the argument
against MS is that there is a well-defined limit
within which u can 'innovate'. 

As an Engineer and a developer access to source code
is a must, and as I had clearly said in my previous
mail - "developing it or using it is absolutely upto
the skill level of the engineer or anjaneyar using it.
" Maybe u have never needed it, there are people who
need it and who r constantly working on it.

>Hmm...do you really need access to the source code to
type out a
>OpenOffice document. Or does my mom need access to
Photoshop's source
>code to touch up a few photos?

U r repeatedly trying to compare the skill level of
the users to use the code or not. U r mom does not
need source code, but as an Engineer u 'might' want it
if u really believe in improvising. Okay let`s take
the example of a person who has a really good thing to
improvise upon, as one of our fellow luggians said -
trying to meddle with the lens filter in Adobe
photoshop - wud u be able to do it? In the OSS
community he wud be given his due credit!! But in the
MS world his suggestion(error report) wud be taken and
incorporated(not sure) and somebody else takes credit
and gets name,fame and shiny new cars. 

>Err....that's why a majority of the Fortune 500
companies run Windows ,
>is it? :-) Seriously, do back up your statements with
benchmarks.

Well, I sure presume you know that most of them r
migrating to Linux and in this process a new field
called migration technology has emerged. If u have
people doing it as a regular professional job, then
just imagine the sheer extent to which actual
migration is happening. Well, in simple terms ur
talking abt history and I`m talking abt the future.


>Ok, the point I'm trying to make here is that a
debate on Linux vs
>Windows is pointless. 

I shud infact thank you for the "Are you serious?"
thread that u had started. A very good quality
argument from all fellow Luggians has come out which
has undoubtedly been trying to prove things as they
are and not as how you and I percieve it to be.'

This is not something which you and I can end, it will
go on and has been going on for quite a long time,
ever since Linus sent his first mail about the OS code
which he had developed from Minix. Trying to say that
this argument is 'pointless' is comical and conveying
the msg that they have diff target audience is
baseless. You , me, our fellow Luggians  and the
programming community is the target audience. 

>Windows has a different target audience...Linux
>has a different target audience. 

What do you think? OSs are not tamil/bollywood movies
which are made for village subject,city subject,etc,.
They r meant for the world. I don`t really understand
what u mean to say by the word "target audience".
C`mon wake up!! You, me and whoever reads this mail in
their computers are the target audience. 

> Let's say that Microsoft
>suddenly ceases to exist one day....then what
happens. Who are you gonna
>target next? Apple?
>The only thing that
>irritates me about the OSS community is their
perpetual obsession with
>Windows and MS.

OSS is not against MS company and Bill gates` fortune,
it`s against the "MS policies" which does not allow a
user/programmer to do what he wants. Well, that just
sums up 'our' OSS policy.


>Do understand that Microsoft has a huge bunch of very
talented people
>who produce some great software. You want to impress
me..do so with
>software.

I very honestly accept that MS has great programmers
and also moth eaten company policies!! But be
magnanimous enough to accept that the OSS programmers
are also 'great' programmers and not 'debuggers' as u
had said. 

>You want to impress me..do so with
>software. Make Linux do stuff that Windows cannot do.
Make OpenOffice do
>stuff that would kick MS Office's behind. Make
FireFox so good that you
>give the IE team in Redmond sleepless nights. Forget
about the
>MS-bashing...its just a huge waste of everyone's
time.

The point is the OSS community impressing the world
with quality software which is already doing the
'kicking' activities as u have mentioned above, or
else nobody wud be migrating to Linux and have Linux
project test labs which produce amazing results. 

It is only bcos somebody has not been content with the
performance, a migration to Linux has come out and
that has wlays been succesful. Tell me one company
which has reverse migrated bcos it hasnt found the
performance of Linux/OSS satisfactory!! But as for all
the other migrating stories, u`ll be hearing it all
over!!

We r trying to compare the pros and cons of things and
not bashing,thrashing,trolling,flaming.........

Anyway this has definitely been a good quality
argument where newbies have come to know so many
things!! Honestly speaking, I myself got a good
comparison of MS and OSS due to the so-many posts
trying to give the correct picture.

The comparison given does not fit.

1. People don't do anything with the statue. It would just sit in a 
corner.
   No maintanence required.
2. It doesn't have any output and the only input is that it occupies 
space.
    Not so with software.
3. In the case of software, fortunately and unfortunately, there is no 
difference
    between the cast and the statue. The software is both cast and statue.

In the case of the cast like most scientific inventions, you can patent 
your cast design
for some period of time and collect royalty from anyone using it within 
that time frame.

Software is not something like that.

The Buddha statue was not cited here to bring in any divinity.
Please don't go to the level of God. It would be way out of topic.
It also colours the discussion in a different way.

for the question a), as for as Redhat 9 with GNOME, you can take a
snapshot of the whole screen  with just "printscreen" button, for taking
a snapshot of a window use "alt+printscreen" combination. you can
customize the shortcuts with mainmenu > preferences > keyboard shortcuts.

If nothing works use GIMP. It has nice utility to capture the screen shot
use file > acquire > screenshot.

I've been thinking about my replies to this thread and I think I've been
guilty of confusing two separate things - Linux as a product and the
whole philosophy behind OSS. So I thought I'd split my arguments from
now on....

First of all, Linux (the product)
----------------------------------

>Trying to say UIs are bad in all OSS is a spurious argument in itself.
It all depends upon the user, and present day if u consider 
>proprietary Windows and OSS Linux the UI does not differ to the 'bad'
extent.

Usually, sweeping generalizations are bad form. But in this case , I
think I'm more than justified. Apart from the Mozilla guys, I can't say
that there is a single OSS project out there that dedicates itself to
usability. Do understand that usability does not mean adding a bunch of
wizards to your software as an afterthought. People like Microsoft and
Apple have whole labs (buildings with hundreds of people) working on
usability....measuring,testing,imporoving,etc. Do you think Google would
be where it is today without the help of Jacob Nielsen?

I find it interesting that you say that the GUI doesn't differ from
Windows to Linux. Though MS licensed a lot of GUI concepts (like
overlapped windows) from Apple and Xerox, stuff like the start button is
solely a MS innovation. And what do I see today? Both Gnome and KDE
shamelessly ripping them off...In fact , nowadays, both KDE and Gnome
look like a skinned version of Windows. Where is the innovation? Soon,
MS will come out with Longhorn(which has a mind-blowing interface...I've
been lucky enough to see sneak previews which are not available on the
net). Where is the corresponding OSS plan? 


>GUI is a concept and a technology in itself and trying to say that GUIs
in OSS are 'bad' very well applies to Windows which also believes >that
GUI is the best thing promoting it`s 'quality'. Trying to compare two
OSs on the same technology of GUI and saying one is 'bad' isn`t >a
healthy argument in itself.

Why not? I was comparing the ease-of-use of both Oss and I found the
GUIs as the easiest barometer. As for CUIs, you're right...Linux kicks
Windows' behind. However, that'll soon change with Longhorn (google for
Monad)

>I think IBM and Sun know better abt this than both of us do - They r
talking abt freedom to tweak with ur code 

Tell me...has IBM released the source to DB2? Or Sun its Java
implementation? Sun and IBM want to get involved with Linux purely
because that's the only hope they have of competing with MS. You would
be deceiving yourself if you though they really believed in the
principles of OSS.


>Tell me one company which has reverse migrated bcos it hasnt found the
performance of Linux/OSS satisfactory!! But as for all the other 
>migrating stories, u`ll be hearing it all over!!

I didn't have to look far.Just read the thread titled 'Success story' on
this group a few days back :-)


>What r they going to do with the several TBs of errors resulting due to
OS problems? Trying to say Win is error-free wud be a big joke!! 
>Linux handles almost all such things u have mentioned with a simple msg
which prevents u from carrying on further than let the whole 
>platform on which all the applications r resting to crash and having to
do the 'holy' act of restarting the system. 

They analyze the errors. They figure out what is causing the errors.
They look at ways of fixing it ( a lot of which is making its way into
SP2). Saying that Win is error-free is a joke...but so is saying the
same thing about Linux. About the error message, I'm not sure whether
you've seen XP. XP pops up a message box about whether you want to
report the error(and users have the option of turning off this
notification) and then shuts down the app. You get the 'Abort,Retry..'
message only if you have a debugger like Visual Studio installed on your
comp. When was the last time you saw a blue-screen with XP(mind
you...you should have MS-certified drivers. I don't think even Linux can
do much about bad kernel-level stuff). I once wrote an app to allocate
over 2gb of memory(in small increments). It took a long time ...,but XP
was stable once I shut down the app. Don't compare the 9x series with
2k,XP or 2003. These new Windows based on the NT kernel are rock-solid.


Now, for Linux - the process(FSF,GNU, Bazaar et. al)
-----------------------------------------------------------------


>You feel having the source code as an Engineer it`s a luxury but the
whole of the OSS community and even the programming world wud 
>consider it as a requirement.

The OSS world - yes. The programming world - no. Tell me, why don't you
ask Intel or AMD to give up their processor making technology? Why apply
a different barometer to MS? Or why don't you ask IBM to give up the
source code to DB2? Why go after MS alone? 


>By debugging other`s code u can see what`s essentially wrong, what is
right, what can be done!! Anyway OSS programmer are not debuggers. 
>They dont get error reports and debug their previous versions and 
>re-release them under a new 'jilpans' name. All people in the OSS
community are rightly credited and they r as famous as the tool they 
>have developed or contributed to. They get their due share of name and
fame and r not unpaid programmers. They get their share of fame and >are
paid well. 

Now, you really got me wrong here. I never called OSS developers as
'debuggers'( if I did,a couple of friends of mine in the Bangalore LUG
would chop my head off :-)) . I'm saying that the scope for employment
developing so-called proprietary code is much higher. I want to ask the
people on this group...how many of you make a living by *developing* OSS
software? No, administering a Linux network/server doesn't count. How
many of us can be like Miguel Icacza and get paid by Novell?

As for people making money of OSS, I want to point you to another raging
thread on this very thread....where someone asked about making money off
the GPL...and people advised him to use some other license ! Say you've
spent two years with a team of 20-30 people developing an app. You make
it open-source...and then bang! Some one else comes along....takes your
code...makes a few modifications and starts making money. How do you
prevent that?


> The Godforsaken code had to be leaked and not given out fairly to the
programming community. This seems to prove the point.

What point? That code has now been in the open for almost a month and
I'm sure thousands of people have looked at it. And all they've found is
one vulnerability in IE which had been fixed 3 years ago. In fact, there
was an article on www.kuro5hin.org reluctantly admitting that the code
was of very high quality. 


>When I say innovation I very specifically mean what lies beyond the
available domain

Do plug-ins or the hundreds of other extensibility mechanisms. You
mentioned the Lens filter in Adobe Photoshop. Well, Photoshop exposes a
plug-in mechanism which lets you write your own filters and what not.
And I could go on for years about .NET's extensibility and flexibility.
Yes, I'm sure that there are a few fringe cases where the extensibility
mechanisms won't be sufficient. But I perfectly understand Microsoft not
wanting to expose their work(which has cost them a LOT of time and
money) for this miniscule minority ( If you disagree, I would like you
to show some stats proving that this is not miniscule).


>OSS is not against MS company and Bill gates` fortune, it`s against the
"MS policies" which does not allow a user/programmer to do what he
>wants. Well, that just sums up 'our' OSS policy.

Ok....2 things here. One, like I've already repeated ad nauseum, why not
ask IBM to let you work on the code to one of their software? Or ask AMD
to let you help out with their technology? Why pick on MS? If MS is so
evil, why haven't they sued the Mono guys yet? (who implement not only
the ECMA part of .NET but also a lot of MS - patented stuff)

Two, I would really like some examples of *mainstream* Linux
modifications not possible with Windows not possible due to the lack of
source code. This is the core disagreement...whether the source is
necessary for the average user/programmer or even if it is necessary for
the majority of the users.

>OSS programmer are not people in Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanam who do
honorary work - they r very much programmers who program every day >for
their daily bread

Please see the other thread on this group regarding making money using
the GPL.


>But be magnanimous enough to accept that the OSS programmers are also
'great' programmers and not 'debuggers' as u had said. 

I never said that!!! If I met Eric.S.Raymond on the street tomm, I would
be too speechless to even pull out my autograph book :-)
OSS programmers are just as good as any other programmers. The question
here is on philosophy...not on skill or talent.

>Anyway this has definitely been a good quality argument where newbies
have come to know so many things!! 
Finally,...something we both agree on :-)

Anyway, I think a debate between Windows vs Linux is pointless. The
answer always lies in how good the user is and what the task required
is. You are right when you say that you and I are not going to end this
debate here. Anyway, I'm not comfortable with talking about Windows on a
Linux user group...off-topic posting is never good. If you remember,
this thread started because somebody posted some wrong information about
MS presence in Chennai colleges...I never wanted it to get into a
traditional MS vs Linux debate. If anybody feels offended, I apologize..

As for the argument regarding the philosophy, I believe the core
question is one of IP (Intellectual Property ) rights. MS believes that
you use what you've developed however you want...make money if you want
to...keep it to yourself if you want to. That's  the core difference
here.

So how does that matter? (BTW, the communities have direct access to
Microsoft employees working on .NET....just thought I'd mention it).
I've seen happy groups of vintage car owners...people who collect
toy-trains...people who are brought together just because they meet at
the same gym. Do these people 'own' the stuff that ties them together? I
don't think so.

These communities (the ones around Microsoft technologies) have existed
for years. What makes you doubt their longevity ?

I totally agree. The IE team has been asleep ever after they rolled
Netscape into the ground. I'll be really happy if Firebird can give
those guys a run for their money...in the end, we (the consumers) will
be the winner. I'm not saying Microsoft is perfect...they have done a
lot of bad stuff and have abused their monopoly too. But they don't
deserve the kind of criticism they constantly get (especially since
they've improved tremendously in the last couple of years). You know
what really excites me right now? Microsoft vs Google? Two companies
...both of which I really admire. Google is no Netscape or WordPerfect
or IBM (OS/2)..they won't sleep. Its gonna be a pretty exciting
battle...lets get the pop-corn and watch this battle :-)


BTW, the upcoming WinXp SP2(which is a free download) adds a bunch of
features to IE (including pop-up blocking). I'm waiting for the
flame-wars regarding Longhorn to start....for then, expect to see some
really long mails from me:-)

What principles? A lot of universities and companies have access to
Windows code as well as a lot of governments. I'm surprised that you've
heard some derogatory comments about FSF/GNU...can you tell us when and
where this was? And even in the case it actually happened, do you mean
to say that there are no derogatory comments about MS here? Do
understand that MS consists of over 55,000 people...a lot of different
viewpoints. However, let me tell you...EVERY SINGLE MS employee I've met
runs some Linux distro at home without letting his employer know. Do
read what I just said...those guys are just as much hackers as anybody
in the OSS community. If MS didn't support these principles, how do you
explain www.gotdotnet.com workspaces or www.sscli.net. Or all the .NET
projects on SF?


>Just count  the number of bugs/problems/vulnerabilities and viruses let

Like what? For every single Windows vulnerability that you can point me
at, I can point you to a Linux vulnerability. I'm not sure you guys can
take the high-ground here...after all, if I remember correctly,
www.debian.org (supposedly the most cutting edge distro),
www.gnome.org(last week) and www.gnu.org (twice) have all been hacked.

No, they're not supported. But the community around them will more than
be willing to help out. Now, let me ask you something..let's say I own a
business running on RH8. Now,as you all know, I won't be eligible for
support very soon unless I shell out some cash. Now, whom do I call for
help when something goes wrong? Like the saying goes, people in glass

And if your answer is gonna be that they'll turn to the community,
please do realize that the same applies to MS products. If you feel that
there isn't a community surrounding MS products, you are deceiving
yourself.

Don't be so sure...I've seen people answer doubts regarding
VB5..sometimes, even Win 3.1 (a guy wanted a browser). Those are
technologies that MS does't support anymore...but our "corporate-driven"
community(as you put it) is more than happy to help out. What is the
definition of a community? A bunch of people tied together by a single
theme? In our case, it is Microsoft technologies. However, this does not
mean that we are dependent on MS. MS has never tried to influence our
group in any way...I'm free to start asking users to install Linux and
MS won't even question me about it.

Please do realize that just because this is a MS -related community
means that people are not programmers and hackers. These guys are just
as good as any of the programmers in the OSS domain and just as
committed to the community. Even if MS were to shut up shop tomm, the
community would still survive. Why? Because we'd still have a unifying
theme...and we'd all be in the same boat.

Now, let me ask you this...let's say SCO wins its case against IBM and
the existence of SCO code in Linux is proven ? Then what happens? Does
everybody go start work on Hurd? Or do they pay a lot of money to SCO?
What happens to the OSS community then when their kernel is yanked from
under their feet? Now, I know that the answer is a resounding yes..that
the OSS community would still survive. Now, how doesn't this apply to my
(and related groups)?

<Disclaimer>

I think SCO's allegations are total nonsense and bull**** and have no
doubt that IBM would win. I'm just asking you to explore a hypothetical
situation

Dear Raman,
Architects, Auditors, Civil Engineers, Great analogy, but wrong
placement, in my humble opinion.

Mckenzie, Accenture, PriceWaterhouse, provide services, only, too. Ask
them to open out their Body-of-Knowledge.

Or, like Suresh recently asked, ask Pepsi/Coke to out with their
formula. After all, it is in the mixing, ain't it?

At the same time, as an aside, even if I videotape my mom cook (what is
it with programmers and their moms? They seem to draw her out of the
kitchen way too often!!) and try the same dish the next day, I don't
think I will get it... But, then, even if SHE tried the same dish the
next day, it mightn't be as good (only better?).

Essentially whole business model should from 'selling product' to
'providing service'. Actually software should not be considered like any
other physical product.

We better think the way professionals like Architect,Auditors,civil
engineers do. All the services(or product) are there for all to see and
copy, improve. Still, these professions thrive well.

If we take Proprietory Software companies as role model and try to fit
that model in Opensource, it may not work.

You will simply have to write  to a mailing list like ILUGC (yes, with
a 'commercial' tag) asking people who know $software to do the fix for
you. Either some enthusiastic college student who has been reading the
code in his free  time will be  able to help you  (who knows? maybe he
would be happy if  you took him out for a lunch  at GRT grand days) OR
someone  who  has been  contributing  to  $software's  CVS might  come
forward with a fix. All because there is the source code. 

(note: it could just  be that you will have to hunt  for people at the
right mailing  list. Its far easier  to find someone who  knows how to
fix a software that has the source code)

You are likely to need extra codecs as well. They are available at

But note that those are not Free Software.

I'm not sure whether I would want my business to depend on how much free
time a college student might have. Especially one who is not answerable
to me..what's to stop him from ditching me one fine day? Here, I can sue
MS or some other vendor. With the GPL, I can't even hold anybody legally
responsible.

I don't see anything other than  trivial difference. Both of them know
their areas of expertise really well. Both know how to trouble-shoot
problems. Both are really passionate about the stuff they do. And people
here DO know how most stuff works on the inside...just because you don't
have access to source code doesn't mean that you don't know how a system
works. So tell me...where's the difference?

You are absolutely right...it is a perfectly meaningless argument. I was
trying to show you the pointlessness of saying that 'Windows is insecure
because there are viruses written for it'. If users are willing to opn
email attachments which run executables, I'm not sure MS can do to
prevent that.

BTW, how is that whenever some Microsoft site gets hacked, people here
snigger and say ' Windows vulnerability' but when a Linux site gets
hacked, they say 'Err..the sysadmin must have known better'. Are you
saying that www.gnu.org, www.debian.org, www.gnome.org (probably some of
the biggest OSS sites along with www.kernel.org) all have bad sysadmins?
I know this is a silly argument...the point I'm  trying to make here is
that no one gives Microsoft a fair hearing or rating.

<P>Hi Sriram </P>
<P>i really appreciate your patience for posting&nbsp; your opinions . what do u mean by the following line </P>
<P>"When was the last time you saw a blue-screen with XP(mind you...you should have MS-certified drivers." Who is MS to certify the drivers. why should MS certify a driver which has already passed the test done by the developer of that driver under windows. This shows that MS likes Monopoly (Dont Flame me )&nbsp;and ppl who dont have the hardware certified by MS face problems when installing Operating Systems like Windows 2000 and Windows XP especially. My friend also faced the same problem when he brought an original copy of XP Prof which did not accept the driver and as you said i saw BSOD which is of course not due to MS but due to the fact that the driver was given a "force install "and once that happened we saw BSOD in XP but it was quite different from 98 :-)). An Operating System should be developed keeping in mind that the customer might use any branded hardware and once if the customer installs the driver for that hardware the Operating system should support it thats
  it .Assume that u want to install Windows longhorn in your system that u currently own . Mind you Long horn will be shipped only in 2006 so no&nbsp; one knows about the hardware compatibility issues. So will u just ditch ur sound card or your video card which is working perfectly with XP to satisfy Longhorn ???? . What does this mean !!!!! This is what ppl hate with MS . The freedom should be given to the user !! .Put yourself in the shoes of the developer and think !! U ll get an answer </P>

<DIV></DIV>&gt;for the question a), as for as Redhat 9 with GNOME, you can take a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;snapshot of the whole screen&nbsp;&nbsp;with just "printscreen" button, for taking 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;a snapshot of a window use "alt+printscreen" combination. you can 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;customize the shortcuts with mainmenu &gt; preferences &gt; keyboard shortcuts. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;If nothing works use GIMP. It has nice utility to capture the screen shot 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;use file &gt; acquire &gt; screenshot.

<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; Hi, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;=20 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; a) How do I take a screenshot of anything in Linux? (Gui I mean)... In 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; Windows, I would just hit printscreen and go to an image editor and get 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; it 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; "paste"d. Tried but no luck, on KDE running on Knoppix/Debian. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;=20 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; b) Which is the best GUI (okay, there is nothing called the best, I hear 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; you 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; say, so which is the most popular?) for Linux? I wanna stick to one and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; learn that well. (Learn a GUI?? Yeah, unlike Windows, I already see the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; Linux GUIs oozing with power and productivity-boosts if only you know how 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; "do" it right). 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;=20 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; c) If you don't want me to waste your time with questions like a and b, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; answer d at least. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;=20 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; d) Is there a website for Linux-Newbies (particularly winusers in 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; previous 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; avatar)? Where they explain answers for stuff like a and b? 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;=20 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance.

<DIV></DIV>&gt;Date: Thu, 1 Apr 2004 20:05:53 +0530 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I've been thinking about my replies to this thread and I think I've been 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;guilty of confusing two separate things - Linux as a product and the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;whole philosophy behind OSS. So I thought I'd split my arguments from 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;now on.... 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;First of all, Linux (the product) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;---------------------------------- 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;Trying to say UIs are bad in all OSS is a spurious argument in itself. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;It all depends upon the user, and present day if u consider 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;proprietary Windows and OSS Linux the UI does not differ to the 'bad' 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;extent. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Usually, sweeping generalizations are bad form. But in this case , I 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;think I'm more than justified. Apart from the Mozilla guys, I can't say 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;that there is a single OSS project out there that dedicates itself to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;usability. Do understand that usability does not mean adding a bunch of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;wizards to your software as an afterthought. People like Microsoft and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Apple have whole labs (buildings with hundreds of people) working on 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;usability....measuring,testing,imporoving,etc. Do you think Google would 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;be where it is today without the help of Jacob Nielsen? 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I find it interesting that you say that the GUI doesn't differ from 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Windows to Linux. Though MS licensed a lot of GUI concepts (like 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;overlapped windows) from Apple and Xerox, stuff like the start button is 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;solely a MS innovation. And what do I see today? Both Gnome and KDE 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;shamelessly ripping them off...In fact , nowadays, both KDE and Gnome 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;look like a skinned version of Windows. Where is the innovation? Soon, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;MS will come out with Longhorn(which has a mind-blowing interface...I've 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;been lucky enough to see sneak previews which are not available on the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;net). Where is the corresponding OSS plan? 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;GUI is a concept and a technology in itself and trying to say that GUIs 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;in OSS are 'bad' very well applies to Windows which also believes &gt;that 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;GUI is the best thing promoting it`s 'quality'. Trying to compare two 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;OSs on the same technology of GUI and saying one is 'bad' isn`t &gt;a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;healthy argument in itself. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Why not? I was comparing the ease-of-use of both Oss and I found the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;GUIs as the easiest barometer. As for CUIs, you're right...Linux kicks 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Windows' behind. However, that'll soon change with Longhorn (google for 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Monad) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;I think IBM and Sun know better abt this than both of us do - They r 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;talking abt freedom to tweak with ur code 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Tell me...has IBM released the source to DB2? Or Sun its Java 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;implementation? Sun and IBM want to get involved with Linux purely 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;because that's the only hope they have of competing with MS. You would 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;be deceiving yourself if you though they really believed in the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;principles of OSS. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;Tell me one company which has reverse migrated bcos it hasnt found the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;performance of Linux/OSS satisfactory!! But as for all the other 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;migrating stories, u`ll be hearing it all over!! 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I didn't have to look far.Just read the thread titled 'Success story' on 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;this group a few days back :-) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;What r they going to do with the several TBs of errors resulting due to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;OS problems? Trying to say Win is error-free wud be a big joke!! 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;Linux handles almost all such things u have mentioned with a simple msg 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;which prevents u from carrying on further than let the whole 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;platform on which all the applications r resting to crash and having to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;do the 'holy' act of restarting the system. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;They analyze the errors. They figure out what is causing the errors. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;They look at ways of fixing it ( a lot of which is making its way into 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;SP2). Saying that Win is error-free is a joke...but so is saying the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;same thing about Linux. About the error message, I'm not sure whether 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;you've seen XP. XP pops up a message box about whether you want to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;report the error(and users have the option of turning off this 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;notification) and then shuts down the app. You get the 'Abort,Retry..' 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;message only if you have a debugger like Visual Studio installed on your 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;comp. When was the last time you saw a blue-screen with XP(mind 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;you...you should have MS-certified drivers. I don't think even Linux can 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;do much about bad kernel-level stuff). I once wrote an app to allocate 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;over 2gb of memory(in small increments). It took a long time ...,but XP 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;was stable once I shut down the app. Don't compare the 9x series with 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;2k,XP or 2003. These new Windows based on the NT kernel are rock-solid. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Now, for Linux - the process(FSF,GNU, Bazaar et. al) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------- 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;You feel having the source code as an Engineer it`s a luxury but the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;whole of the OSS community and even the programming world wud 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;consider it as a requirement. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;The OSS world - yes. The programming world - no. Tell me, why don't you 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;ask Intel or AMD to give up their processor making technology? Why apply 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;a different barometer to MS? Or why don't you ask IBM to give up the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;source code to DB2? Why go after MS alone? 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;By debugging other`s code u can see what`s essentially wrong, what is 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;right, what can be done!! Anyway OSS programmer are not debuggers. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;They dont get error reports and debug their previous versions and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;re-release them under a new 'jilpans' name. All people in the OSS 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;community are rightly credited and they r as famous as the tool they 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;have developed or contributed to. They get their due share of name and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;fame and r not unpaid programmers. They get their share of fame and &gt;are 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;paid well. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Now, you really got me wrong here. I never called OSS developers as 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;'debuggers'( if I did,a couple of friends of mine in the Bangalore LUG 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;would chop my head off :-)) . I'm saying that the scope for employment 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;developing so-called proprietary code is much higher. I want to ask the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;people on this group...how many of you make a living by *developing* OSS 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;software? No, administering a Linux network/server doesn't count. How 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;many of us can be like Miguel Icacza and get paid by Novell? 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;As for people making money of OSS, I want to point you to another raging 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;thread on this very thread....where someone asked about making money off 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the GPL...and people advised him to use some other license ! Say you've 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;spent two years with a team of 20-30 people developing an app. You make 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;it open-source...and then bang! Some one else comes along....takes your 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;code...makes a few modifications and starts making money. How do you 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;prevent that? 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt; The Godforsaken code had to be leaked and not given out fairly to the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;programming community. This seems to prove the point. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;What point? That code has now been in the open for almost a month and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I'm sure thousands of people have looked at it. And all they've found is 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;one vulnerability in IE which had been fixed 3 years ago. In fact, there 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;was an article on www.kuro5hin.org reluctantly admitting that the code 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;was of very high quality. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;When I say innovation I very specifically mean what lies beyond the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;available domain 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Do plug-ins or the hundreds of other extensibility mechanisms. You 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;mentioned the Lens filter in Adobe Photoshop. Well, Photoshop exposes a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;plug-in mechanism which lets you write your own filters and what not. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;And I could go on for years about .NET's extensibility and flexibility. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Yes, I'm sure that there are a few fringe cases where the extensibility 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;mechanisms won't be sufficient. But I perfectly understand Microsoft not 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;wanting to expose their work(which has cost them a LOT of time and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;money) for this miniscule minority ( If you disagree, I would like you 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to show some stats proving that this is not miniscule). 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;OSS is not against MS company and Bill gates` fortune, it`s against the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;"MS policies" which does not allow a user/programmer to do what he 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;wants. Well, that just sums up 'our' OSS policy. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Ok....2 things here. One, like I've already repeated ad nauseum, why not 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;ask IBM to let you work on the code to one of their software? Or ask AMD 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to let you help out with their technology? Why pick on MS? If MS is so 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;evil, why haven't they sued the Mono guys yet? (who implement not only 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the ECMA part of .NET but also a lot of MS - patented stuff) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Two, I would really like some examples of *mainstream* Linux 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;modifications not possible with Windows not possible due to the lack of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;source code. This is the core disagreement...whether the source is 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;necessary for the average user/programmer or even if it is necessary for 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the majority of the users. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;OSS programmer are not people in Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanam who do 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;honorary work - they r very much programmers who program every day &gt;for 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;their daily bread 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Please see the other thread on this group regarding making money using 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the GPL. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;But be magnanimous enough to accept that the OSS programmers are also 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;'great' programmers and not 'debuggers' as u had said. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I never said that!!! If I met Eric.S.Raymond on the street tomm, I would 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;be too speechless to even pull out my autograph book :-) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;OSS programmers are just as good as any other programmers. The question 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;here is on philosophy...not on skill or talent. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;Anyway this has definitely been a good quality argument where newbies 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;have come to know so many things!! 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Finally,...something we both agree on :-) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Anyway, I think a debate between Windows vs Linux is pointless. The 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;answer always lies in how good the user is and what the task required 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;is. You are right when you say that you and I are not going to end this 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;debate here. Anyway, I'm not comfortable with talking about Windows on a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Linux user group...off-topic posting is never good. If you remember, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;this thread started because somebody posted some wrong information about 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;MS presence in Chennai colleges...I never wanted it to get into a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;traditional MS vs Linux debate. If anybody feels offended, I apologize.. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;As for the argument regarding the philosophy, I believe the core 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;question is one of IP (Intellectual Property ) rights. MS believes that 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;you use what you've developed however you want...make money if you want 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to...keep it to yourself if you want to. That's&nbsp;&nbsp;the core difference 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;here.

<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt;But the focal point of the community namely .net is not owned by the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;community. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;So how does that matter? (BTW, the communities have direct access to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Microsoft employees working on .NET....just thought I'd mention it). 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I've seen happy groups of vintage car owners...people who collect 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;toy-trains...people who are brought together just because they meet at 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the same gym. Do these people 'own' the stuff that ties them together? I 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;don't think so. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;These communities (the ones around Microsoft technologies) have existed 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;for years. What makes you doubt their longevity ?

<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;&gt;Mr.Sriram or anyone has every right and freedom to think or to become 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;a billionare or even to become a Bill Gates 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I really like this group...people keep saying that I'll become Bill 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Gates :-) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;1. I felt Microsoft really needs a good competitor, which could not be 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;destroyed by any means(IP or any marketing tactics) or should not 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;become obsolete by itself(either it has no supporters or there is no 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;money or ideas to further improve it). I find Linux as good one. Only 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;this kind of competition can make a product better. Look at what 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;happened to Internet Explorer,it didn't have any feature improvement for 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;the past five years. Suddenly there is an announcement that they will 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;introduce new features in the next version, like tabbed browsing, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;pop-up blocking and an option to uninstall plugins. I think this is 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;possible only when there is a competition(though the market share for 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;other browsers were negligible). I don't like microsoft to have 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;monopoly in software market. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I totally agree. The IE team has been asleep ever after they rolled 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Netscape into the ground. I'll be really happy if Firebird can give 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;those guys a run for their money...in the end, we (the consumers) will 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;be the winner. I'm not saying Microsoft is perfect...they have done a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;lot of bad stuff and have abused their monopoly too. But they don't 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;deserve the kind of criticism they constantly get (especially since 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;they've improved tremendously in the last couple of years). You know 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;what really excites me right now? Microsoft vs Google? Two companies 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;...both of which I really admire. Google is no Netscape or WordPerfect 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;or IBM (OS/2)..they won't sleep. Its gonna be a pretty exciting 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;battle...lets get the pop-corn and watch this battle :-) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;BTW, the upcoming WinXp SP2(which is a free download) adds a bunch of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;features to IE (including pop-up blocking). I'm waiting for the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;flame-wars regarding Longhorn to start....for then, expect to see some 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;really long mails from me:-)

<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;The cheap trick is using rotor as a facade as if they support the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;principles behind; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;while actually calling the ideas behind the the community names. For 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;example, in a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;.NET presentation I attended (one of the very first) rotor demo was 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;preceded by very 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;nasty comments on FSF/GNU. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;What principles? A lot of universities and companies have access to 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Windows code as well as a lot of governments. I'm surprised that you've 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;heard some derogatory comments about FSF/GNU...can you tell us when and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;where this was? And even in the case it actually happened, do you mean 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to say that there are no derogatory comments about MS here? Do 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;understand that MS consists of over 55,000 people...a lot of different 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;viewpoints. However, let me tell you...EVERY SINGLE MS employee I've met 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;runs some Linux distro at home without letting his employer know. Do 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;read what I just said...those guys are just as much hackers as anybody 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;in the OSS community. If MS didn't support these principles, how do you 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;explain www.gotdotnet.com workspaces or www.sscli.net. Or all the .NET 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;projects on SF? 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;Just count&nbsp;&nbsp;the number of bugs/problems/vulnerabilities and viruses let 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;loose because 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;of the various design choices they made. You will see the funny side of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the above yourself 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Like what? For every single Windows vulnerability that you can point me 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;at, I can point you to a Linux vulnerability. I'm not sure you guys can 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;take the high-ground here...after all, if I remember correctly, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;www.debian.org (supposedly the most cutting edge distro), 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;www.gnome.org(last week) and www.gnu.org (twice) have all been hacked. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Like I said in some other post , people in glass houses....

what do you mean?

suppose I contribute a module to the linux kernel for (say) some sort of 
USB camera.  and suppose I am the manufacturer of that usb camera.

if I submit that module to the kernel, do you think it will be accepted 
on blind faith, without any quality control / checking by the kernel 
maintainers?

Try installing a linux module for say ethernet card that the 
manufacturer shipped in the install CD.  Even if it is source code, you 
may well have problems setting that up on any kernel other than the one 
the guy developed the driver on.

Free software  gives the freedom to  use both the object  code and the
source code.  Disclosing  the source code under a  tight and stringent
copyright  license is  quite different  from distributing  source code
with freedom to study, copy, modify, and redistribute.
 
You are  a Student Ambassador  of Microsoft and an  Official Microsoft
representative, and one  need not expect you to  understand or support
free  software  licenses or  principles,  and  instead,  you could  be
expected to  promote the  profits and business  of Microsoft  in every
possible by even writing non-stop  nonsense to a gnu/linux user group.
One  can know  about principles  from  the licenses  and other  public
reports, and misstatements don't help anybody.

You won't  have heard of FreeBSD,  NetBSD or OpenBSD.
 
You  won't have  heard  of the  European  Commission's recent  rulings

well, for out  of the box support, yes many  open source companies are
trying to give good support. Redhat  is one such company that comes to
my  mind. Agree, the  support quality  is far  worse than  what larger
companies like Microsoft  can offer. Support would improve  (at a much

Hallo, 
     Read this!! Sriram, Read this and try to help me
out with what I`ve written in the last section of this
mail, but kindly don`t miss out what lies in between. 

-S.N.Sudharsan.

============================================================================================================

>Apart from the Mozilla guys, I can't say

>usability.

What do you mean? Take a good look at all the other
great tools!!

What r u trying to say, the "My computer" and "Network
neighborhood" make u feel so good and nostalgic abt
MS-Windows GUI and it`s so-called monopolised
usability!!

>Both Gnome and KDE
>shamelessly ripping them off...In fact , nowadays,
both KDE and Gnome
>look like a skinned version of Windows. Where is the
innovation?

I`m trying to tell u that GUI is a concept in which
you have a visual interface comprising of
icons/buttons/windows,etc..........and ur trying to
tell me all of them belong to windows. I`ve studied a
subject called Computer graphics and multimedia - you
have all these visual interfaces well illustrated
there and there is no mention of Windows/Linux. 

My friend, the concept of GUI and all the stuff that
go into it does not belong to Windows. 

Trying to say GUI belong to windows is like saying the
gifts of nature like Basmati/neem belongs to america,
it does not belong to anybody!! It belongs to nature!!
The concept of having a visual representation is GUI
and it cannot belong to people of Microsoft just bocs
they did a wonderful GUI. They might have contributed
but not own it.

You cannot copyright/patent basmati-neem,etc,. They r
nature`s products and trying to say they r yours is
very much of an illegitimate claim. Basmati/Neem
belong to nature and not to india/america/germany.
Even if history wud have been different
someone-somewhere(non-MS) wud have started something
called a GUI only with a menu/pop-up
window/icons/buttons; that is what the subject says
irresptive of the OS used.

Even Solaris has a GUI with menus/buttons/windows, r u
trying to say they copied it from the famous Ms
again?? Forget the wallpapers.......and all those
"jilpans"  screensavers.


>Soon,
>MS will come out with Longhorn(which has a
mind-blowing interface...I've
>been lucky enough to see sneak previews which are not
available on the
>net). Where is the corresponding OSS plan?

You argument favoring MS seems to come more out of
fascination than facts!! You might have to dump ur
processor/monitor/graphics card in the not-so-distant
future, I sure presume u will do that to see the
"Long-Horn". No counter-plan for OSS, just design a
much more friendlier GUI, constant improvisation -as
we call it!!

>Why not? I was comparing the ease-of-use of both Oss
and I found the
>GUIs as the easiest barometer. 

My argument trying to explain ease-of-use was well
illustrated in first reply thread. Ease-of-use depends
on where u start, Windows or Linux!! A person who
starts with "My computer" might find "Home" and the
entire inverted-tree structure annoying and
vice-versa!! When u say ease-of-use, whose
ease-of-use? I dont find any big difference in both
except for some new icons and features in Linux which
r obviously different and difficult, but not because
they r so implicity, but bcos I`m new to them!!
Similarly for u, who must be obviously used to c: and
d: might find '/' and '/root' annoying. 

The difference is perception!! Both r excellent GUIs.
As I had mentioned trying to say GUIs in OSS are bad
is very much spurious in itself!!


>Tell me...has IBM released the source to DB2? Or Sun
its Java
>implementation? Sun and IBM want to get involved with
Linux purely
>because that's the only hope they have of competing
with MS. You would

>principles of OSS.

They r not talking abt releasing all their codes of
products which they have released so far, but they r
talking abt becoming open. They r not going to give
away all their past codes( i presume so), but if they
release a product under the banner of OSS(which they r
trying to do) they wud obviously have to release it!!
My argument is not supporting Java/IBM,etc,........My
argument is abt supporting the philosophy of OSS and
not to keep a check on whose releasing it and whose
not. I`m preaching for the doctrines of OSS and not
for Sun/IBM.,etc,.

>They analyze the errors. They figure out what is
causing the errors.
>They look at ways of fixing it 

They have been doing it for decades together!! What is
that going to result in? 
The most-perfect-creation-of-mankind-the-magnum-opus
called Longhorn?? We`ll see that!!

>I once wrote an app to allocate
>over 2gb of memory(in small increments)

Send the code to the group!! Or is it 'taboo'?

>The OSS world - yes. The programming world - no. 

What r U talking abt? The real world/matrix stuff. A
code is a code be it in the "OSS world" or the
"programmers world", a code is a set of lines that
does a specific function.  All r programmers, when
they program, it is essentially lines of code for the
computer to understand. It is only when it comes out
and is shaded with policies such as MS/OSS it becomes
the way u call it!! Essentially speaking, both r lines
of code. What do u see, two different factions??
Programmers do the same work, be it in Red Hat Inc,.
or Microsoft Inc,.,- code!! 

The problem is how it comes out, or whether it ever
comes out or not!!


>Tell me, why don't you
>ask Intel or AMD to give up their processor making
technology? Why apply
>a different barometer to MS? 

When  ur talking abt Intel processors ur talking abt
hardware components and not something u can change the
way u want it to work(of course u can!!). There is a
specific functionality to a device like a processor.
You write assembly language to modify the
functionality not change the design of the processor.
We r not talking abt open source hardware but about
OSS.

>I want to ask the
>people on this group...how many of you make a living
by *developing* OSS
>software? 

What r u trying to say? only people working in MS r
paid. As u urself had pointed out, there r people who
need OSS as a hobby and who r essentially very good
programmers who want to do things or make things
happen with their system. But what r u trying to tell
me, there arent anybody involved in 'paid' OSS work.

>You make
>it open-source...and then bang! Some one else comes
along....takes your
>code...makes a few modifications and starts making
money. How do you
>prevent that?

Let`s analyse the thread that`s running abt this
carefully. Let this "Are you serious" thread go
on.........but keep a watch on that. It is only when a
flower blooms u actually see the beauty behind it!!
(That`s my saying - not the proprietary 'my' - I meant
that I framed it!!) 


>What point? That code has now been in the open for
almost a month and
>I'm sure thousands of people have looked at it. And
all they've found is
>one vulnerability in IE which had been fixed 3 years
ago. In fact, there
>was an article on www.kuro5hin.org reluctantly
admitting that the code
>was of very high quality.

You say programmers shud have IP rights and u say Ms
supports it and u once again say MS is "in" for OSS!!
What r u trying to say MS is an open source
organisation or is it the MS, most people in the OSS
world know? We r not talking abt code quality anyway!!
We r talking abt code availability!!

My favorite game is still "Age of Empires-Rise of
Rome" and is possibly the best ever; so what??

That MS code was anyway 'leaked' and not bundled with
ur CD!! Anyway I have a question to ask, is ur Windows
XP bought, or just simply 'loaded and installed'? Have
u bought ur Windows XP CD from a "Windows certified
vendor" or just one of ur friend`c CD like almost all
others(including me) and most of them who open this
mail in their "Windows".If u say u bought it for 6000
odd rupees...:)) haha. I`ll be waiting for a honest
answer from you!!

>But I perfectly understand Microsoft not
>wanting to expose their work(which has cost them a
LOT of time and
>money)

What do u mean 'expose'? ur not exposing the Odessa
file!! ur supposedly 'exposing' the code to ur own
community and most importantly to the person who has
paid u money to use ur software!!Forget the
community.......MS doesnt even respect the customer!!
Let me send an "error report" saying I have bought
Windows XP, pls give me the source code because I`m a
developer who will need it!! Are they going to
incorporate this suggestion and make the
most-perfect-creation-of-mankind-the-magnum-opus 
Longhorn an open source model!! 

As to why code is necessary........there r so many
posts.....pls read them............!!

>this is the core disagreement...whether the source is
>necessary for the average user/programmer or even if
it is necessary for
>the majority of the users.

This is the core point indeed!! the average user/avg
programmer  might not need it, but what abt those who
need it?? Is Ms going to conduct a survey amongst prog
on whether they need code or not? I`ve given a
comparison between a layman/normal user/Engineer, pls
read that again!! 

What abt an Engineer/developer? What abt you? I think
u might not need them............I can c that ur
extremely happy with all that u`ve got from MS, anyway
that`s good news!! Atleast u can R-I-P!!


>Please see the other thread on this group regarding
making money using
>the GPL.

As I said I`m following it very closely!!


>The question here is on philosophy...not on skill or
talent.

That is what I`m also talking abt...........


>Anyway, I think a debate between Windows vs Linux is
pointless

What do you mean? Pointless. Why do you make it a
point to respond to all the threads?? Bcos u want to
prove a point!! So do we!!


>If you remember,
>this thread started because somebody posted some
wrong information about
>MS presence in Chennai colleges..

If it`s wrong information that Ms is spreading it`s
word on seeing somebody else spread their 'gospel'
then the point can be accepted. As again, it wud have
been seen the other way around!!

What if OSS followed MS there in MIT?? You wud have
said OSS guys r trying to counter MS with their
"shameless rippings"(as u wud call them). I`m sure u
wud have.......


>As for the argument regarding the philosophy, I
believe the core
>question is one of IP (Intellectual Property )
rights. MS believes that
>you use what you've developed however you want...make
money if you want
>to...keep it to yourself if you want to. That's  the
core difference
>here.

Ms does not believe in that choice "if u want to", it
says make money and keep it to urself and don`t treat
the customer as a customer but treat him as a person
who has walked into a dead-end. I know that MS firmly
believes in this!!

The 'best' part abt MS is it doesnt give u too many
choices!!  There r people happy with their choices and
as it goes - "Ignorance is bliss!!" and for the others
they aren`t and Ms obviously does not allow u to even
look at other choices!! The only choices I see are
"Abort/retry/ignore", "Illegal Operation"(the only
allowed choice being 'close'), "Send/Don`t send error
report" and finally "Are you sure you want to
restart?"
I dont mean these choices!! Nor does OSS!!

OSS says, if u believe in the "Ignorance is bliss" go
on just run my programs!! Or else u also can look
beyond what u have, it gives u a choice!! Linux/OSS
does not believe in an outright charity show either!!
Mind you Linux-EL is 99,000/-



>Actually,my mom wonders what in hell I spend so much
time in front of my

That`s bcos ur busy restarting MS!! :-)


>Anyway, I guess I'll
>let the whole world use my wonderful Pepsi/Coke
analogies under the
>Creative Commons License...;-)

Alas ur coming in terms with OSS!! Welcome to the
club, my dear friend!!

Summary:  Okay, I`ll put this question to you!! What
are you trying to say thro` repeated threads?? You
said u use Linux and u find a lot of 'cool' stuff and
u flay the UIs and their functionality!! You said MS
is against OSS policies but u say that they release
their codes too(to elite thieves, who leak
them)!!Contradictions a plenty!! 

What suggestion wud u like to put forward to the ilugc
which is in a way a representation of the OSS
community itself?? I`m not asking this bcos I did not
understand what u had said, but since this thread has
gone tooooooo big, I feel at times u r missing the
point(As u had confessed-confusing b/w the product
Linux and OSS) and sometimes we respond to points that
have been posted simply bcos we find it unacceptable
as members of an OSS supporting mailing list. If u
feel u want to support Ms, it`s very much of ur
choice, but we r people(most of us) very much
convinced by ideologies of OSS!! 

I subscribed to this not just to get some knowhows and
howtos and keep answering and questioning but bcos I
find this concept fascinating in itself!! So in the
process get to know more abt the concept of FSF and
interact with fellow likers/lovers/admirers.

I repeat, try to summarize ur views on the "Are you
serious?" thread, bcos a lot of times we r busy
flaying each other`s products and missing the
difference in each other`s philosophies. I`m asking
this only bcos this thread has assumed monstrous
proportions and has in many ways reached saturation!! 

Your question abt the core difference is answered
above - OSS gives u choices, Ms believes in sealing
those choices!! The question is abt 'Choice'!! (I`m
not bald headed and I`m not searching for "The One") 
:-) :-)

Hi,
  Finally, we get to the end. Well, I would like all of you to read the
last section of my mail carefully. But first, let me get to responding
some of Sudharshan's points

>Trying to say GUI belong to windows is like saying the
>gifts of nature like Basmati/neem belongs to america,
>it does not belong to anybody!! It belongs to nature!!
>The concept of having a visual representation is GUI
>and it cannot belong to people of Microsoft just bocs

You know what? Frankly , I think Windows GUI su**s when compared to
Apple's. However, I think it is better than what Gnome or KDE currently
has to offer. I was talking about the lack of a 'usability' culture in a
lot of OSS products.I'm a big usability/HCI buff...so trust me, I find
Windows bad on this front quite often too. Trust me, if Gnome or Kde
work together with people like Jacob Nielsen (www.useit.com) or Bruce
Toggazzini (www.asktog.com), you'll be giving Bill Gates sleepless
nights :-)

Having said that, I'll be surprised if someone tells me that KDE or
Gnome totally ignored Windows when they developed their GUI. If you look
at the history of GUI, Windows is quite different from Mac (common menu
bar). I find Gnome /KDE (and do I need to start on Lindows) eerily
similar to Windows...especially stuff like the taskbar, start button
which is very much MS specific. If this is a coincidence, fine. But I
really doubt it. However, the Gnome /KDE guys have innovated on MS
GUI...well..for that atleast, kudos to them. However, what's the shame
in admitting where you got your inspiration from? Don't be like Deva or
Anu Malik....:-)

>You argument favoring MS seems to come more out of
>fascination than facts!! You might have to dump ur

Very true...I find MS fascinating. But unfortunately, this thread never
gave me the chance to talk about other companies of which I'm a bigger
fan , namely, Google and Apple.However, I've tried to back up my
arguments with facts whenever possible...unfortunately, when we get into
philosophical debates, it isn't possible for me to link to
surveys/stats, is it?

As for Longhorn, yes, I wouldn't mind upgrading my comp. I'm sure my
current comp would be in a unusable state by then. I'm sure very few of
you would be using the same config three years from now as you're using
today.

Regarding IBM and Sun (sorry, couldn't find something small enough to
quote)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--

With IBM and Sun, I agree with Eric. S. Raymond when he says Sun needs
to make Java open-source. You can't pay lip service to a set of
principles and happily ditch it when it suits you. For example, the
members of this group have been prepared to defend OSS very passionately
just as I've tried to defend the 'other side'. However, I really don't
agree with people supporting one side when it suits them and then
happily forgetting about OSS when it comes to their cash cows.

I say make Java open source. Make it a project on SourceForge. Stick it
to MS and .NET :-) Then , we can all have fun.


Regarding Intel and AMD
----------------------------------------

The principles of GNU extend beyond software . I remember reading of
some Open Hardware projects recently but I can't find the link on
slashdot. Anyway, the point I was trying to make is...by your argument,
Microsoft doesn't trust its customers with the secrets behind Windows.
Ok...point taken. Then, why don't you say Intel doesn't trust its
customers with its processor technology? I'm sure AMD would like to look
at how hyper-threading works. Maybe one of us can improve it. How does
this argument relate only to Microsoft? All I'm saying here is...don't
blame Microsoft alone of something. There are a lot of companies who
believe in the same stuff as MS does but doesn't talk about it openly.

>They have been doing it for decades together!! What is
>that going to result in? 
>The most-perfect-creation-of-mankind-the-magnum-opus
>called Longhorn?? We`ll see that!!

Hmmm..the first Windows OS came out in 95. Error reporting came only 2
years ago. So I don't see the 'decades' timeline. As for the results,
they're coming in the form of service packs and upgrades. Do look at
what's coming in XP SP2.Longhorn is over 3-4 years away.



>Anyway I have a question to ask, is ur Windows

answer from you!!


I was waiting for this question :-). Anyway, let me say that atleast for
the last 3 years, I've been running genuine copies. The truth is, I get
Windows from 2 places. One is from my college which has a MSDN Academic
subscription which lets students install software at home(which means I
have legal copies of Visual Studio.NET,Office,etc). Another one is the
copy I've got from Microsoft for my Student Ambassador-ship.

>The OSS world - yes. The programming world - no.

Sorry, my mistake here. What I meant was 'OSS World - yes. Non-OSS world
- no). I was basically trying to make the point that in the non-OSS
world, people don't feel that they need access to source code. Now, I'm
saying this is what they 'feel' . Feel free to flame me on whether
they're right :-)

>But what r u trying to tell
>me, there arent anybody involved in 'paid' OSS work.

Absolutely not. But are you sure that there are more job opportunities
with developing OSS than 'proprietary' software? If you say 'yes', then
you're sadly mistaken, my friend.I'm saying that compared to
closed-source, OSS has far lesser employment avenues (I'm talking of
hardcore development - not administration,etc). However,a caveat
though...I find it interesting that no one replied to my open question
on whether they make money by developing OSS software. I'm very curious
to know of possible employment avenues through OSS...so I'll be really
happy if some professionals on the group could tell us about the cool
OSS work they do . (I'm being sincere here...after all, I'm a geek too
:-) )

>What do u mean 'expose'?

When I say 'expose', I mean taking the risk of people copying your code
and making money of it with you ending up with nothing. As you say,
developers might need it. But how do you protect yourself from
plagiarism(I'm not sure what the correct term is when it comes to
software).? Is copyleft good enough?

Ok..one small request. I've been trying to Google and see incidents
where the GPL has been brought up legally. Does anyone know of any
incidents where the GPL /copyleft has been brought to a court of law
other than with SCO? 


>What if OSS followed MS there in MIT?? You wud have
>said OSS guys r trying to counter MS with their

>wud have.......

Come on...you can't guess at what I would have said. And, please, like
I've already stated, MS at MIT was due to the students of MIT.If the
students want MS there, why deny them?


>>That`s bcos ur busy restarting MS!! :-)

Fine ...fine. I'm trying to think of something funny to say regarding
recompiling your kernel to get sound from your computer.....but anyway,
I'll stop myself :-)

>If it`s wrong information that Ms is spreading it`s

I'm happy to see that you're actually admitting that there was wrong
information in the first place. However, it is not possible to
contemplate the 'would-have-beens'. I'm not saying that it is totally
out of the question...If the roles were reversed,I'm sure there are
clueless people on my group who would say that LUG is following
MS....but I guess they exist everywhere , don't they? (And no jokes
about me being one of those clueless people :-) )

>Alas ur coming in terms with OSS!! Welcome to the
>club, my dear friend!!

Signs of me spending way too much time on this group. I'm probably going
to do badly in my sem labs today because of these mails...I think I'll
blame OSS. OSS is evil...look...it made me flunk my exams ;-) I wonder
whether my examiners would take kindly to the idea of the other students
in the exam hall 'sharing' their knowledge. ;-)

<disclaimer> Ok..that was a joke. A very bad joke..but a feeble attempt
at one nonetheless</disclaimer>


Ok...this has gone on long enough. Let me try and summarize as
Sudharshan has asked me to.



First of all, I've not been clear as to MS's attitude with Open source.
Let me try and explain. 

When you guys say 'Open Source' , you mean the GPL. However, when MS
says open-source , they mean anything but the GPL. Basically, its like
this. MS believes in releasing parts of their code to selected people if
they believe that the act would be mutually beneficial. Some times, they
chose to release it to the public as well. However, MS is very staunchly
against the GPL..especially what they call the 'viral' nature.

However, what they do believe in is that not ALL code should be open
source. MS wants to have a choice as to which code can be made visible
to the public and which code stays secret. This choice doesn't exist in
the OSS world(as that would go against the very tenets of the FSF).

So please do understand, when MS says 'open source', they mean the act
of releasing source code and giving you the ability to do anything with
it (without having to make public your changes as well). If you offer
suggestions /improvements, it is upto MS to take it in or not. However,
you're free to make money out of it...and keep your modifications
secret.

I hope I cleared up some of the confusion surrounding MS's principles on
OSS.If you still have any doubts, please do post questions about that
only (MS views on OSS licenses) in a separate thread and I'll try to get
people more informed than me to reply.


Now, like Sudharshan said, I've both said that I use Linux and at the
same time , criticized parts (the GUI,etc). Now, criticizing does not
mean that I don't like Linux. At no point have I actually said that I
don't Linux. My criticisms stem from my views on flaws that exist in the
current-day Linux world(whether they're perceived or real is left to
you). As for my act of criticism, I would like you to read
http://aroundcny.com/technofile/texts/kde_react99.html. I genuinely want
Linux to do well. I don't want to see Microsoft as the only OS vendor.
If they don't have competition, they won't bother innovating (like with
IE). Competition is always good.

Now, as for my suggestions to this group. Well..where do I start? How
about how I got into this group?

Basically, even though I run Linux at home, I'm still very much a Linux
newbie. It took quite some time for me to get familiar with stuff...and
I still struggle with simple things such as installing dependencies to
rpm files. So I thought'Hey...just as my .NET group helps people with
.NET, maybe a Linux group can help me out'. A friend of mine in the
Bangalore LUG had once mentioned this group. After a bit of Googling, I
managed to sign up.

I've been very much a passive observer (I believe the appropriate term
is 'lurking'). And trust me, I've learnt a lot.However, when I saw that
there were some false facts being spouted about my group about the stuff
my friends have been doing in other colleges, I decided to clear up a
few things. Little did I expect that it would spawn off such a monster.

Frankly, I was overwhelmed by the respnse I got. I strongly considered
not replying at all..in my early mails, I had specifically asked whether
people wanted me to stop. However, since people here seemed to enjoy the
discussion(and I've enjoyed it tremendously too), I started replying to
this thread. Pretty soon, I was replying to any thread criticizing
Microsoft or closed-source group. This was probably a mistake and I
should've stuck to this thread alone.But anyway...

 Its not for me or you to decide who's going to win in the long run -
closed or open source. Ultimately ,it's the consumer who'll decide. But,
I want to see a nice fight...I want to see competition for MS. A
monopoly can never be good anywhere. However, what does pain me is the
obsession around MS in the OSS world. Guys, if you're gonna forever
think of MS as the enemy and celebrate whenever they trip up, then
you're wasting your time.

GNU/OSS is an intriguing concept by itself. Yes, I'm not convinced of it
today...maybe someone else will make such a compelling argument one day
that I'll switch over too. But whatever the case, the principles of Free
software are rock-solid and they need no MS-bashing to help them. For
every minute you spend talking about Microsoft trying to brainwash
students here in Chennai...is another minute that MS spends tirelessly
innovating.

Nowehere in all I've read about OSS does it say that closed software and
OSS can't co-exist. We're gonna be using both for a very long time to
come...so might as well get used to it.

My suggestion is this. This is a 'Linux user group'. Not a 'Lets bash
Windows' group or a "M$ s**ks' group. Like I've already said, lets talk
about Linux and other OSS software. Lets talk about GNU ideology. Lets
talk about RMS meeting Kalam. Lets not talk about Microsoft getting
hacked...or Microsoft opening up a group in some Chennai college.Do
understand that not all the people here necessarily agree with the GNU
principles (such as me). However , we do want to try out Linux(the
product)...such constant talk around Microsoft turns us away.

Let me try to answer the 'core question' to the best of my ability.
Microsoft believes that GNU/OSS belittles the concept of IP(Intellectual
Property). You feel that OSS gives you chice...fine...fair enough. MS
believes that GNU takes away the ability to make money and profit from
your work though the GPL says this is not the case. Whether they're
right or wrong is not for you or me to decide...its the consumer who'll
decide .

Anyway, I hope this is the last mail on this thread.I've had immense fun
and learnt a lot. I've made mistakes and have been corrected
appropriately too. However, I'm pained to hear that a lot of people here
don't really find this thread useful (my posts have been called
'constant rubbish and nonsense'. I'm all for open debate...if not here,
I invite you all to sign up in my group at
http://groups.msn.com/cnugstudent

I think both our sides have done our fair share of 'point-proving'. I
only regret the fact that MS had only me to defend
them...unfortunately,I couldn't get more informed people to sign up to
this mailing list in time. So all of you only got to hear my
opinion..while I got to hear a lot of people's opinions. 

Well, this brings us to the end (hopefully). I've to admit I thoroughly
enjoyed myself and I don't regret signing up at all. I unfortunately
missed out on the last LUG meet in IIT but I'm going to make it a point
to attend the next meet.  I would also like to request one of you to do
sessions on Mono/dotGnu for my group's meets. What say? 

In the end, as geeks, such competition between MS and GNU is good as it
means that not only do we get opposing view-points...but we also get
some cool software and technology in the process. And I guess, in the
end, the end-user is the ultimate winner in this battle...as he should
be.

Once again, thanks for such an enlightening discussion. I'm sorry if I
offended anybody...you won't see anymore mails from me unless
specifically asked for.


Regards,
Sriram Krishnan

Sad but true. MS definitely has a bad rap on the security front
(especially with IIS).And deservedly so. But anyway, they're improving
(no known exploits yet for IIS 6 in over a year). However, MS has a long
way to go before they lose the stigma over security issues. But do trust
me when I say they are working hard at it. In the end, viruses help
nobody....

Ok...the truth is I kind of screwed up there with my phrasing...I kinda
meant them openly talking about in public forums or evangelizing Linux
or OSS in some way. But anyway, you're rigth. MS has made some mistakes
but its attitude is changing massively. Just check out sites like
http://blogs.msdn.com . However, I'm not sure any employer would take
kindly to you openly admitting to using a rival's products. But yes,
this is definitely an area MS needs to improve upon as a company...being

<P>I think you have taken my argument in the wrong sense. I am not talking about drivers that&nbsp;are written by&nbsp;small companies which&nbsp;may have lot of problems when installed&nbsp;. I am talking about companies like Lancer , SIS and the others who have been writing drivers for&nbsp; a pretty long time.I&nbsp;faced problems when i tried installing a SIS 6215&nbsp;Video Card driver&nbsp;in XP. XP&nbsp;didnot detect&nbsp;my&nbsp;Card nor did it&nbsp;allow me to install SIS&nbsp;6215 Driver from the&nbsp;original Driver CD. I accept that the&nbsp;card is not&nbsp;very new but still my&nbsp;Card was&nbsp;working perfectly&nbsp;with Linux, with Windows 2k so just for installing XP should i ditch my&nbsp;Video Card&nbsp;So i am not talking about&nbsp; small companies writing a driver . I am talking about well known&nbsp;companies who ve been supplying drivers for many of their products which were previosul accepted by MS in their products like 98 and even in 2k.But now si
 nce they are not not currently listed in the Microsoft Hardware Labs which signs the drivers The end user is unable to install the Driver.</P>

Hi,

Did anybody come across PostNuke and PHPNuke.  We are planning to setup a
portal for our department of CS at CEG.  PostNuke is being talked about
security.  From the PHPNuke-howto, it seems like PHPNuke people claim that
they are not second to PostNuke in anyway.  Did anybody tried them?  Which
one of them seems to be most appropriate for you?

What I say:

Hey, I thought up a groovy new algorithm for Process Scheduling. I want to 
implement
it and see it working in real time. How do I do it?
I have choice:
1) Implement in Windows.
2) Implement in Linux.

Choice 1:
Implement in Windows - Er, but, I don't have source code for windows 
kernel to compile.
What do I do? Choice again:
1) Join Microsoft.
2) Join a company which has  been given access to MS Windows Source Code.
3) Get admission into some University which has access to MS Windows 
Source Code.

Now,
Choice 2:
Implement in Linux.
Good - We have all we need. Sit at home. Download source code.
Write my code. Compile. Run. Simple. :)

Now, What they say:

Hey, I have got this groovy neat algorithm for Process Scheduling.
I want to sell it and make money out of it. If I give away the source,
someone else will make money out of it.


I believe that this is the basic difference.

One sees Software as Knowledge.
Other sees Software as Product from an assembly line.

What I feel is we can see Software as Knowledge and still earn money as 
long as
we keep pace and try to be the best in what we dish out. That, I believe, 
is OSS.

ignorant about the  plans of MS for you?  Or, are  you ashamed of your
role?  Your diabolic rants only  waste time and space in the archives.
There is no need to reply  to every meaningless accusation, and may be
it is better to ignore rants for good.

The concern is that the student community should be alert and alive to
the emerging trends, and analyse objectively the benefits derived from
using free  software over non-free software.  Suraj  recently posted a
link  to  http://zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl/~nikodem/linux4chemistry.html .
I  downloaded  garlic and  tried  using  it.   One can  visualise  the
molecular structure  of vitamins,  protiens, and many  other compounds
with great ease  using Garlic, which is a free software.   I am not an
engineer  but  I  do  envy  the resources  available  to  the  student
engineers  of the  day  to  learn and  improve  their knowledge,  made
possible through  the free software  movement.  There are  better ways
students  could use  time available  to  study and  use free  software
programs, and think of using or improving them for the benefit of all.

Well, I guess it was only a matter of time before this came up. But
anyway, let me clarify. I'm NOT an official representative of Microsoft
by any stretch of the imagination. The reason I became a Microsoft
Student Ambassador is because I find their technology cool and love
talking about it. This is no way means that I'm talking for Microsoft.
In the same way, I do not expect you to talk officially for the FSF.
This is just an informal (and a quite fun)discussion between a bunch of
people who believe in different stuff..and who're trying to get stuff
clarified. So far, I've been happy with the way this discussion has been
conducted vis.a.vis no personal attacks, name-calling,etc.A lot of
people have come forward with their opinions (I admit, quite a few of
which I don't agree with) and it is understandable. The views and
opinions in my mail are very much my own (I'm not sure MS would take
kindly to me saying that the IE team has been sleeping for the last 3
years)

But I would never say that this discussion was bad. You always need open
debate in a free(no pun intended) society.. There can be no 'winner' or
'loser' in this debate. However, the important thing is what we all gain
from the process.

Again, back to my student ambassador thing, my only job is to educate
students about the Microsoft technologies already available. I'm not
here to sell anything...I'm sure I have counterparts evangelizing OSS
among students here in the LUG as well. If any of you want to talk to me
in person and figure out ways of working together, you are free to mail
me at ksriram@gmx.net


 >>by even writing non-stop  nonsense to a gnu/linux user group. One  can
know  about principles  from  the
 >>licenses  and other  public reports, and misstatements don't help
anybody.

Ok...this I object to. I really don't think I was writing 'non-stop
nonsense'. I've made mistakes on a few occasions and have been aptly
corrected by the members of this group. However, I'm sad that you think
that I'm in some way bringing disorder to this group. So, I've decided
to end the thread 'Are you serious' with a final reply to Sudharshan.

Do read my post to Sudharshan for my final take on the various issues
discussed. Hope you guys had as much fun as I did and learnt as much as
I did. If any of you were offended, once again , I offer my sincerest
apologies.

Sriram

Atlast a great news. Microsoft represenative in Linux User Group. 

Hope, one day Microsoft will join OSDN.

Mr.Sriram Krishnan has not purchased copy of any M$ product sofar. I
pray God that he will stay loyal to M$, once his student days are
over and starts paying for his software out of his hard earned money.

He is talking about sue MS. If you read EULA carefully it says
'No liability for consequential damages..... including... incidental
loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business
information....... In any case .... liability under any provision of
this agreement shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you
for the SOFTWARE and/or Microsoft hardware'

So you sue MS, at the maximum you can get cost of software back,
nothing else. Go ahead try to sue for each vulnerability discovered.

The dialogue here so far have been very civil and open, but I think this
is unfair :-( Sriram's rants has not been diabolic - rather, it gave us
a view of the "other side."

I'm all for free software, I believe the existence of free software and
GNU project has made computing (and the world in general) a much better
place than what it could have been without it. And that is the important
thing. But free software is not perfect, and Sriram does has some valid
points - that he's a Microsoft Student Ambassador doesn't change them at
all. I mean, we should be more concerned abbout improving ourself as a
community.

so  does your  argument. It  stems from  a fascination  about  the OSS
philosophy. The  point of this  entire thread is whether  source being
open  is really  necessary  (and advantageous)  than  a closed  source
system (which  in our example is  Microsoft -- a bad  example since an
operating  system that has  its roots  from DOS/Win3.1  will obviously
have  difficulty scaling to  the modern  day security  / extensibility
requirements). Let me bet that IF GNU was not based on Unix and say it
was based  on some  other fancy  idea, it might  not have  become this
successful.

Let  us  consider,  SAP  for   example.   Its  almost  going  to  beat
GnuEnterprise hands down. The point being, SAP has been in development
for ages.  Its  become perfect over X years  with an N-thousand people
working / giving  feedback / fixing it. Given  the closed source model
SAP uses, its refinement cycle is not faster. But with a free software
/ open  source development cycle,  GNU enterprise will reach  the same
level of 'maturity' in less than X years if N-squared-thousand+ people
work  on it.   (ok, dont  bring in  the million  monkeys jumping  on a
keyboard analogy -- A large fraction of Open Source developers work on
a  said project  because they  are interested  in it  and  they almost
certainly would  know what they  are doing). Take emacs  for instance,
its  older  than   me!   I'm  sure  the  man   hours  that  went  into
writing/refining emacs is *huge*.

The disadvantages I see of the  open source model is when:

a.  the  software  needs  not  just  programming  expertise  but  ALSO
functional knowledge (like SAP for example)
b.  the  software  is   considered  "uncool"  by  the  majority  (like
'accounting packages' for example).

There are over a hundred  different types of audio-player software and
shoot-em-up  types  games.   Why  aren't there  that  many  Enterprise
software or say an Encyclopaedia encarta thats got flashy animations?

The technical stabilitiy /  excellence argument will almost always see
most  proprietary software  as advanced  / better  than  the Free/open
source equivalents simply because lots of man hours have gone into its
making (although, things have changed radically now (especially on the
server side)).

Certainly I do see a lot of  good (good == software gets better. Not a
single individual's pocket) due to Free/Open Source software.

Cud be cached pages!! But anyway check the document
root and NamedVirtualHost directive just above the

Cached pages can be deleted by deleting history and
offline content and i u use opera just hit File-->
delete private data.

Restart system+service and try again!! -

Why won't you let this go? Anyway, ad nausem, let me point to the very
first mail I sent to this group where I introduced myself in the very
first paragarph. Or in my latest summary mail to Sudharshan where I
spoke about where I got Windows XP from.I definitely haven't been trying
to hide. It would have been easy for me to hide...just remove my email
sig and post from a different id. In fact, all throughout, I've been
exhorting people to sign up in my group. If you were one among the
people who had taken up my offer, you would have seen me sign mails
there as 'Microsoft Student Ambassador' .I only talk of myself as an
ambassador when I'm doing work for MS (as in going to other colleges and
talking for MS or talking in MS events).

As for the 'official' thing , I meant that I'm not talking for Microsoft
here. They do not edit or influence anything I say. And please stop
trying to make me out as some sort of MS lackey...I'm definitely not.

When I'm fulfilling my role as a student ambassador, I'll be exhorting
students to start learning .NET and get in touch with other students
learning .NET. I'll talk about where you can get access to various
Microsoft technologies. I'll talk about how you can get the resources
you need from MS. Have I done any of this in any of my mails?

Please do realize that I've a brain and I think on my own...just because
I'm involved with Microsoft does not make me a 'diabolical ranter'. If
you have an issue with any specific point I've raised, do reply on that
thread rather than resorting to personal attacks.

Ok...if I go on any longer, I'll definitely be wasting archive space.


>Your diabolic rants only  waste time and space in the archives.

Diabolic? For god's sake...come on.

Alas!!

We r not comparing 'ur' Windows with Apple but
comparing Windows and Linux. You didnt get the point I
had made abt visual interfaces having features which
wud obviously be similar and not 'copied','pirated' or
'shamelessly ripped'

>I find Windows bad on this front quite often too. 

Great, that`s wonderful!!Maybe that`s the only front u
have seen,have a look at other fronts too!!

>you'll be giving Bill Gates sleepless nights :-)

OSS is already doing that and nowadays he is busy
trying to stop people from migrating by giving counter
strategies to Linux!!

>Having said that, I'll be surprised if someone tells

C`mon, how many times do u want me to repeat it? Even
if there was some other compnay which wud have started
something called GUI it wud have had these
features.....the concept of GUI is not copyrighted to
Windows...........What do u expect KDE or GNOME to
have...functions/buttons that pop out of the monitor??


>However, what's the shame

Don't be like Deva or

I`ve given over 27 programmes in the All India Radio
and Doordarshan, well I can counter your "musical"
opinion. Deva and Anu malik can compose music taken
from the basic seven notes, that is not copying. Only
if they recycle from boyzone and BSB stuff people call
it piracy!! GUI and music are similar, but u say music
belongs to Boyzone and deva cant` copy it!! Ultimately
music doesnt belong to anybody, they r only the same 7
notes, modified,refined and fine tuned. So is GUI!!
The same iconic representation, user interaction using
input devices,etc,...........

Well, please dont start that, there r user groups for
apple and google. This is meant for Linux/GNU/OSS/FSF.

Quite obvious!!

It goes without saying that when u release a product
under GPL/OSS model the code has to be released,
that`s innately understood!! It applieas to
Sun/Moon/IBM.................and Mannar & Co. too!!

>The principles of GNU extend beyond software .

The thread was about OSS and not abt OS-Hardware, well
u must know that better, you started it!! Don`t switch
to other options because it deviated from the topic.
You very clearly said, the topic is abt availability
of code!!


>Do look at

Let me start an "Are you serious?" thread for Longhorn
or XP SP2 in the not-so-distant future!! We r watching
it and we r obviously not interested in finding faults
with it, if it`s good-it`s good. A spade has to be
called a spade, whether u and I like it or not!!

You havent paid for it anyway!! All r copies u got for
ur MS loyalty, maybe the company might be urs one
day!!

>I was basically trying to make the point that in the

That is the world comprising only of MS loyalists and
people who start "Are you serious?" threads in OSS
groups!! No flaming here,don`t get me wrong.It is just
a point being made abt the non-OSS world which
comprises only of MS loyalists.


>I'm saying that compared to

That is what is really changing, take a look at the

started taking their jobs seriously!!

That is what the group is trying to explain to you.

>Come on...you can't guess at what I would have said.
And, please, like

There were students who wanted OSS too.......I guessed
it seeing the repeated words u have been using when
trying to talk abt "Who-came-first?" and
"Why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-road?" statements!!

>Fine ...fine. I'm trying to think of something funny

My computer plays Rahman`s music and my songs very

I have to tell that to you.You have in a way made our 
stand on OSS stronger!! Try to start a
"why_go_for_oss_when_there_is_MS@yahoogroups.com" and
I`ll be glad to be the first member there!!


>when I saw that
>there were some false facts being spouted about my
group about the stuff
>my friends have been doing in other college

What u said is acceptable, but what ur doing is just
the same, flaying OSS with false claims. 
But ur was a benevolent act indeed, why dont u make a
compilation of all the arguments u have posted and
send it to Ms and billgates@hotmail.com, I`m sure u
will get a job immediately, considering ur loyalty!!

>Its not for me or you to decide who's going to win in
the long run -
>losed or open source. Ultimately ,it's the consumer
who'll decide.

Alas u`ve got the point. OSS let`s u decide not MS.

>Nowehere in all I've read about OSS does it say that
closed software and
>OSS can't co-exist
 
Indian and Pakistani politicians do co-exist,
absolutely no problem!!

>I'm sorry if I
>offended anybody...you won't see anymore mails from
me unless
>specifically asked for.

Take my word for it......you haven`t.


My summary:

You see it`s very simple, u dont accept this
philosophy. Well, no problem there r no forceful
conversions(in TN) and we havent been trying to do
that too. You follow what u want to, use XP, watch
videos and all that 'coooooooool'
stuff.............Pls dont try to convert us (or
atleast me) into ur MS world or keep
flaming/ranting/trolling abt OSS stuff!! That`s my
point.

Replying to this thread is very much of ur option, but
this is what I have to say. ILUGC is already linked by
some common interests and I dont have to summarize my
point of view as such, bcos I find it already matching
the majority in the group abt the OSS.

Well, source being open is very much necessary. It

As u have said, the serious work is because they r
full time professionals working on SAP, whereas the
OSS 'community' as we call it comprises of a majority
of hardcore hobby programmers....the most known one
being Linus, as to what he was, when he started it!!

Agreed!!

I sure presume it will change!!

Because of the extent of people who r involved in it
seriously and as I have elucidated above the sheer
extent of "hobby programmers" than "employees". But
anyway as u have said, things r changing radically
now!!

every time or is there a mechanism for that?? Kindly
illustrate!!

The best way is to download the tar.gz or tar.bz2
mplayer files, extract them and install. While
installing, it will say "I want this package to be
already installed, ERROR" and then it will exit.
Download those packages (compressed tar) and install
them first. For to know more about installation,
configuration and codecs u just look at the README and
INSTALL files given along with mplayer installation
files. 
Remember, for to have the gui support u have to use 
configure --enable-gui while installing.
This is what I did, and Mplayer is playing
fantastically.

Hi,
We are planning to have a demo for mixed crowd in our bombay office on
Linux:

The audience would consist of developers, administrators, project leads and
managers as well as senior management.
There will be one person workin on installation over a period of 2-3 days.

This is the software I am thinking of on RH 9:

Message-ID: <20040402132429.23080.qmail@web21113.mail.yahoo.com>

It seems that there is a bug in MD5 hashing algorithm.
I found this thing when I was playing with echo
command. When I echoed some randomly typed letters, It
gave the current users decrypted password partly.
Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. Check
whether u get it or not. 

echo '82 43/25 43+65P80P82P73P76P32P70P79P79P76P10P'|
dc

 If it works for anyone u plz reply me atonce.

If you are using Debian then switch off or uninstall cadium.
THis is a know issue and was caused by cadium.

Otherwise a simple restart would probably do it

I had also attended the brief  but in depth lecture at ilugc by Brian,
who gave several instances how  having the source code and the freedom
to modify it has helped.  He gave the instance of how he looked up for
help in mailing lists and recompiled a module to support his new Nikon
Digital camera.  It  would be nice if the text/notes  of the speech is
made available at the ilugc site.

   Hacking is good thing my friend.  Probably you mean by `cracked`. 
   Nobody is perfect.  But we(OSS) strive to be the most perfect of all.
   Anyway the arguement Windows (till XP) is *less* secure than any UNIX
   is **certainly** TRUE.  You can't false it.
   I was browsing in a Win2k system in our college library.  Seems like I
   had downloaded a mail-virus, from that point I was unable to do usefull
   things with that computer (even when I was using guest account).  Is
   this possible with Linux (without root access, of course)?

'lilo' should be run as super user (root). If you are root, '/sbin' will 
be in your default path.

Three possibilities for this error are

1. You are not logged in as root.
	Soln: Log in as root and try running 'lilo'.

2. If you logged in as root and still you don't get it, then '/sbin' is 
not in your default path.
	Soln: Run '/sbin/lilo'.
	PS: If this is the case you will not be able to run any programs in 
'/sbin' just by their names (eg: ifconfig). To avoid this add '/sbin' to 
your path ($PATH).

3. If you logged in as root and have '/sbin' in your path, lilo may not 
be installed or not in '/sbin'.
	Soln: Try to locate 'lilo' using 'locate' or 'find' if you are sure 
that lilo is installed (Normally source compiled installations allow you 
to put in the directory you want. If you installed lilo binaries, it 
should be in '/sbin'). OR GRUB is there instead of lilo.

HTH.

`----

I did not want to reopen this  thread, but for Sajith's sake, I had to
write  this.  Any rant  advocating MS  is diabolic  in this  list when
as per the jargon  dictionary  at:
http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/m/Microsoft.html

<quote>
Microsoft: The  new Evil  Empire  (the old  one  was  IBM). The  basic
complaints are,  as formerly with  IBM, that (a) their  system designs
are horrible  botches, (b) we  can't get source  to fix them,  and (c)
they throw their weight around a lot. See also Halloween Documents.
</quote>

Some of the rants are sick:

,----[ a rant somewhere in this thread  ]
| Though MS licensed a lot of GUI concepts (like
| overlapped windows) from Apple and Xerox, stuff like the start button is
| solely a MS innovation. And what do I see today? Both Gnome and KDE
| shamelessly ripping them off...In fact , nowadays, both KDE and Gnome
| look like a skinned version of Windows. Where is the innovation?
`----

Cars  have had start  buttons for  a long  time.  Computers  also have
power start buttons on them and booting software follows after pushing
on the  power start  button.  It  is only logical  to have  a starting
point for software and there is always a main function that starts the
processes  in software.   To say  that `start  button is  solely  a MS
innovation' is a tall claim  and saying that Gnome and KDE shamelessly
ripped them off makes no sense.

The X Server was designed to  be used in a networked environment, with
a client/server model in mind  in 1980's, before MS Windows came.  The
concepts behind  X Server  are original and  not found in  other other
operating systems.   It is  the X Server  concept that  makes possible
several  very  different  desktop  environments  -  like  KDE,  gnome,
failsafe,  fvwm2,  icewm,  mwm,  olwm, twm,  DyDe,  Enlightenment  and
others, with each  environment having their own wide  range of themes.
This  is  an  innovative  idea  that  makes a  lot  of  sense,  giving
flexibility and usability  to support a wide range  of users and uses.
Making imputations  against KDE and Gnome developers  accusing them to
have shamelessly ripped off is to say the least, a diabolic rant.

The final rant could only be called BBDR==Big Boring Diabolic Rant

   FYI,

    At CEG, for the auditorium they charge Rs. 3000/- apprx per day.  But
    I think audi. is more than enough.  May be an examination hall kindof
    thing is enough?  Well, anyway I will contact the concerned persons
    about the availability.
PS: If we have many choices, let's try to spread FLOSS in different

1.Any place where we have to pay for hall etc. should NOT be
considered.
we have very meagre resources and it is not worth spending on rent
alone.

2.Ideal will be a school/college situated in a convenient place. It
is if we get three or four class rooms.

3.At present I don't think we have many choices, but it comes it is
most welcome.

4.If you can get few class rooms/small halls from CEG that will be
great.

   Ok.  I will gather information regarding available classrooms in CEG.

   Also, most of the students will be busy with their semester exams this
   month.  So Install-Fest cannot happen this month.

Very true, the concept of decoupling the display from the application
is/was really a very novel idea, if not a stroke of genius.
So too is the X protocol.

   Ok.  There will be no problem regarding the Venue.  We can have it on
   an examination hall at CEG, at no cost.  I have got the permission from
   the President, Computer Society of Anna University for conducting
   Install-Fest for free of charge in CEG.  Class rooms will be provided.
  1. First of all it is difficult to conduct IF this month, as the
  students will be having sememster exams.
  2. Even the subsequent months will be semester holidays.  Still difficult.

Other than those days, I'm sure that the students will provide the
computers for IF.

try it out. it is a little too late (two days too late) for you to catch 
the joke ... reminds me of the sardarji who laughed a whole week later

Gopalarathnam V.



	One of the questions that comes up all the time is: How enthusiastic
is our support for UNIX?
	Unix was written on our machines and for our machines many years ago.
Today, much of UNIX being done is done on our machines. Ten percent of
our
VAXs are going for UNIX use.  UNIX is a simple language, easy to
understand,
easy to get started with. It's great for students, great for somewhat
casual
users, and it's great for interchanging programs between different
machines.
And so, because of its popularity in these markets, we support it.  We
have
good UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.
	It is our belief, however, that serious professional users will run
out of things they can do with UNIX. They'll want a real system and will
end
up doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.
	With UNIX, if you're looking for something, you can easily and quickly
check that small manual and find out that it's not there.  With VMS, no
matter
what you look for -- it's literally a five-foot shelf of documentation
-- if
you look long enough it's there.  That's the difference -- the beauty of
UNIX
is it's simple; and the beauty of VMS is that it's all there.
		-- Ken Olsen, president of DEC, DECWORLD Vol. 8 No. 5, 1984
[It's been argued that the beauty of UNIX is the same as the beauty of
Ken
Olsen's brain.  Ed.]

Hello Biju
           I accept that this is a serious discussion
group. Do u know y this group is for ? We are here to
promote linux, discuss our problems and for helping
each other. The main thing that we gain totally  is 
we r learning, learning, learning ...
Am I right ?
I will not accept that the thing I sent was completely
rubbish. U can learn from it but in an indirect way.
Remember that I sent a joke based on Linux and not
some other ... I think u can understand what I mean.

Now Mr.Ramkumar has enquired that how the command
works ? He learns. Think everything in a positive way.


Correct me  If Iam wrong .

This is a calculator based on stack concept ( Last in
First out , LIFO ) i.e pushing and popping.also it
employs a parenthesis free logic invented by a polish
mathematician before second world war. 
Here are some examples ...

echo '65p'| dc  --> pushes the value 65 to a stack and
then as it encounters 'p' it pops out the value as an
integer.

echo '65P'| dc  --> pushes 65 and pops out as a
character.
as the character corresponding to 65 is A it is
printed.

echo '+' | dc  ---> says stack is empty. coz when it
encounters + it pops out last two values from stack,
calculates the sum and it pushes the result to stack.
same applies for *,/ etc.

echo '5 5+p' | dc ---> prints 10.
so 
echo '65P80P82P73P76P32P70P79P79P76P10P' | dc
is enough for printing APRIL FOOL. the other things
are redundant just for confusing.

Looks Pretty good :-)

You can try with my college (SRM Engineering College). As college is not
working now (exam/holiday season), you might be able to get the seminar
hall easily. Just make sure that you tell the Principal/HOD that it is
an event for the students too...and get the college students to attend
too.

One problem might be the distance...my college is some 20km from
Tambaram.

My apologies to everyone for replying to this though I explicitly stated
that I won't reply. I felt that I shouldn't take these personal attacks
lying down. Anyway, I'm not going to do any Microsoft / Windows vs.
Linux stuff...just defend the extremely ridiculous accusations brought
forth by Ramanraj.

>>Any rant advocating MS is diabolic

Hmmm...so much for an open-mind from a proponent of open-source.
However, I'm happy that the rest of the group has been more open to
debate and more tolerant to opposing viewpoints.

Hmmm...ok... I remember Mr.Ashokan Pichai talking about the difference
between our two communities. So, I would like to ask Mr.Ashokan
Pichai...is this the difference you were talking about? That the people
from my group are willing to learn Linux(and a lot of them are here in
this LUG) but the people of your community view an invitation to come
and see my group (and I had invited you guys to come and do a session as
well) as diabolic and evil? Well, in that case, then you're
right,Mr.Pichai and I was wrong..then there is a difference between our
communities.

BTW, Mr.Ramanraj, if you had actually bothered to take up my invitation,
you would have seen that my group meet at MIT was an event organized by
the students where you had a person from Polaris come and present. No
Microsoft presence.

To the members of the group, I would like to say this. We may
disagree...fine.We have opposing viewpoints ...fine. What I take as
fact, you may dispute...and vice versa....that's fine too. But I'm not
sure how any of you can justify going after someone solely by virtue of
where he's from rather than by what he says. Personally, after seeing
this mail, I'm very disappointed..because the discussion we have had had
been very civil and friendly (and sometimes humourous...)but of late it
has become personal.

Sorry for yet another...and hopefully my last Big Boring Diabolic Rant.

Message-ID: <406EFF77.9060508@ntc.net.np>

Abstract:

Licence fees and GDP per capita: The case for open source in developing 
countries by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh

There is a strong case for free software (also known as open source or 
libre software) being deployed widely in developing countries. As argued 
in this note, the open source development community provides an 
environment of intensive interactive skills development at little 
explicit cost, which is particularly useful for local development of 
skills, especially in economically disadvantaged regions. Further, this 
note argues that the controversy over total costs of ownership (TCO) of 
free vs. proprietary software is not applicable to developing countries 
and other regions with low labour costs, where the TCO advantage lies 
with open source, and the share of licence fees in TCO is much higher 
than in high labour cost countries. The note concludes with a table 
comparing license fees for proprietary software against GDP per capita 
for 176 countries.

I was wondering if anyone on the list knew whether or not wireless
setups have been de-licensed. I'm looking to set up a wireless
transmitter in the middle of my city to beam a community living a little
far away access to broadband internet, because touchtel doesn't reach
that far out. I want to find out where or not it is legal. I think it
has been de-licensed for internal community usage, but whether i would
be allowed to do it for this particular purpose is what i would like to
find out.

Internal community usage as in "you can get an internet connection in by 
other means, like broadband, leased line or VSAT, and then set up WiFi 
access points inside your community to share the connection"

Setting up transmitters and repeaters in the city would surely mean that 
you are going to run into ISP license issues.

And another thing you really must take into account is that what you 
propose requires line of sight between your tower and the destination.

During the course of this thread, many members raised several issues -
RamanP pointed to portions in the  MS license in reply to the `go sue'
approach,  and  many  other  members  raised issues  pointing  to  the
disadvantages in using proprietary software, for which there have been
no replies till date and they remain substantially unanswered.  If the
advocates of  proprietary software have been searching  for answers in
their favour, and failed to find any, then they have already taken the
first right step, by joining this  list and I sincerely wish and bless
them to soon become full fledged  free software users. It is better to
stop cringing and crying in the darkness and seek light. Free software
gives the  freedom to free  the mind.  It  is never too late  to whole
heartedly join  the movement to work towards  better programs, greater
freedom and profits for all :)

Mr. Mohammed Riyaz, is that site you sent really true/credible?
If yes.
That was one of the most frightening things I have read. Frightening
becos it could affect you and me. I feel eerie and spooked when I think
that I might be subject to subliminal messages, all the time. If
Free Software has such *intentional* harmful tactics. How could one 
believe
propreitry ones? And I have lost respect of RMS.
He says, "Free Software is the freedom to express opinion", as a 
justification
of his act. He can express his opinion. But he should not try to influence
free will of individuals. Sending subliminal messages is like hypnotising
or mesmerising you into doing something. Its far more evil than trying to
monopolise the software industry.

I stand for Free Software. But, I hate RMS.
I shall never use emacs.

If you want to know more about the usefulness/harm of subliminal messages
and mental suggestions google for "Alpha Mind Power".

Ram

Hi Ram,

Didn't you read what my mail said, it said two things,
1. Also read the viewer comments on that page.
2. It also said if you are going to mail me  back that this group is a
serious one, then dont read it.(which i think makes things a bit obvious)
:)

But i fell for it 2, till i read the viewer comments, so join the club 
:)

On April 1st, Google said that it was lauching Google mail [beta] with a 
1GB mail box, cool search features etc.  I signed up promptly to reserve 
my name there.  Later, a lot of news came that it was an April Fool 
thing, and I had a good laugh :-D  Recently, The Hindu reported about 
Google mail.  Is Google serious or joking?

 Searching through Goole is much faster than searching the local system 
for most of us- because google using more than 100 networked computers 
[that run using gnu/linux. see: 
http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html ] to answer a single query.  I 
really wish Google launches a real GMail portal soon [using the email

Thanks for the good news, and yes, I meant the free software Gnu/Linux - 
please use the name Gnu/Linux because

Standing  by the  ideology  of  Free Software  is  very nice.   Asking
everyone  to use  the  term  'GNU/Linux' works  against  it.  From  my
experience  I notice that  people tend  to move  away from  using Free
Software  because of  this "perstering".   I learnt  it the  hard way.

Secondly non-free software  isn't as evil as the  illiteracy / poverty
that  exists  in this  country.   so if  ASHA  wants  to use  non-free
software, i think its fine, but well, I'm speaking for myself :)

Well, thats a different thing -- here is the history:

RMS  was  about to  visit  ILUGC  and we  had  to  quickly change  all
occurences of  'linux' to 'GNU/Linux'  fearing the after  effects. (at
that point  I was the web  master of chennailug.org and  I didn't know
much about the GNU project, so  I changed to make sure ILUGC stands on

"LUG". so he visited MIT instead.

So ok, you did a quick sed s/linux/Gnu\/Linux/

There's every reason that I can see to just rename the LUG back to its 
correct name - ilugc.  What was sed can now be unsed I guess.

Very feasible - but there was some mention of doing a linux and gnu 
advocacy talk at the demo.

Right now, advocacy is a good thing, but it must not include long 
lectures on philosophy.

I prefer to let things like Unreal Tournament linux version on a radeon 
/ GeForce type card speak for themselves (as well as stuff like open 
office, sylpheed / thunderbird etc)

They kind of speak far louder than a dozen people saying GNU, GNU ...

I beg  to differ. Its important  to tell people about  the history and
why its important for a software to be free. but well, me sitting here
far  away from  ILUGC and  chennai and  doing all  the talking  on the
mailing list  without doing  any real help  makes me... umm...  a mere
chatter box.  I would rather  let the people  who do the  demo (namely
Raman, Bharathi and all the others) decide what they want to do.

if I were a part of the demo, I would make sure there is a talk on the
history / philosophy, though.

I agree that  too-much-philosophy might end up boring  them.  Maybe we
just have to frame a nice way of narrating it all.

We do both philosophy and technology. I think they are inseparable.
Off course I would like to do/talk more technology and less
philosophy (may 80:20).

Why do you think they are inseparable ? I usually stay out of GNU 
related issues (I'm  agnustic :) but this intrigues me. Do mail me 
offline if this is getting OT for the list...

I think they are inseparable in public shows where we propagate, in
private conversation or in using the software we don't need to think
about philosophy if we don't wish.

When we go and talk in public they cannot be separated. Many ask
questions like 'what you gain out of this', 'which company sells
linux' , 'today it may be free after some time you will charge'.

IMHO had Linus not released Linux under GPL (instead released under some
other license like BSD/Apache style), it would not have become this
popular!
I'm not saying non-GPL software are not popular though...

Hi all,

PCQ Linux === the cds are scratchy most of the time.. At least one scratch
at least in one CD.
We had to buy three copies to get one installable set.
Anyway, some say, if you do a media test before installing, and return it to
the company, they might return / replace with good ones.
Try.

hi all,
 
i have configured a squid proxy server  which uses one static ip which was provided by the ISP....we have a iptables configured which controls outward and inward traffic on the this machine.
 
my question is that i want to install a mailserver , but whether to use the same static IP and configure in the same machine or....go one for another machine and configure a mail server with a differnt static IP?? and route all incoming and outgoing traffic for the second IP through the first machine in which the firewall in configured.
 
which is a better way of implementing it?

If you do install a mailserver and a proxy on the same machine, please 
make absolutely sure that the proxy doesn't pass HTTP CONNECT requests - 
something like

CONNECT localhost:25 HTTP/1.1

could just make it very easy for spammers to proxy smtp commands through 
your proxy server.

Hi,

More at http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/category/4625.aspx and 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/

It's released under the IBM Common Public License or CPL The CPL is a 
'copyleft' license, just like the GPL. The main point of difference is 
that the CPL has a software-patent protection clause, which the GPL does 
not.

(However, Eben Moglen has indicated that this may be included in the 
next version of the GPL, which would make it compatible)

Linus: I think that's a load of bull.

Yes. By using nCurse Lib you can do Graphics in TextMode and for X 
mode you need Qt/ GTK/ Python/ Tcl/TK/...

You need to install ltsp_sound modules and lts.conf file.Look at full

Use the One True Editor (tm) -- FSF Emacs
You can convert between Unix/DOS file encoding using C-x RET f followed
by either dos or unix.  Of course this would work if you haven't
modified the default keybindings in Emacs.

`Lasu' Releases SAG 0.3 -- Freeware Book Takes Paves For New World Order
by staff writers

	...
	The central Superhighway site called ``sunsite.unc.edu''
collapsed in the morning before the release.  News about the release had
been leaked by a German hacker group, Harmonious Hardware Hackers, who
had cracked into the author's computer earlier in the week.  They had
got the release date wrong by one day, and caused dozens of eager fans
to connect to the sunsite computer at the wrong time.  ``No computer can
handle that kind of stress,'' explained the mourning sunsite manager,
Erik Troan.  ``The spinning disks made the whole computer jump, and
finally it crashed through the floor to the basement.''  Luckily,
repairs were swift and the computer was working again the same evening.
``Thank God we were able to buy enough needles and thread and patch it
together without major problems.''  The site has also installed a new
throttle on the network pipe, allowing at most four clients at the same
time, thus making a new crash less likely.  ``The book is now in our
Incoming folder'', says Troan, ``and you're all welcome to come and get
it.''

As far as I know you can install it over a network... and they say its
not possible to download those files and use it from a CD. If someone
has taken some initiatives to make it installable it would be
great.. I might do that this summer vacation if someone else hasnt
done that already.

This is used to copy a Huge data.
In this case, it will take lesser time than normal
copying process.

It tars the files in current folder (.) and
untar it in the /marathi/marathi folder.

The command is normally used by sysadmins to copy (uproot) an entire
directory tree under the current directory to a different location.

For example, to copy all files (and directories) from /usr/src
to /usr/local/src, you would do:

(cd /usr/src && tar -cf - .) | (cd /usr/local/src && tar -xvpf -)

Commands executed between () parantheses are executed within a sub-shell
(so that they don't change the path for the current shell).

Subject: [Ilugc] Problem with GNOME!
Message-ID: <407253AB.40104@symonds.net>

I am running Debian GNU/Linux Sarge (22 Mar 04) with GNOME 2.4. My 
motherboard runs on nVidia nForce 2 chipset which has nVidia GeForce 
IGP. To enjoy accelerated graphics, I installed the XFree driver 
provided by nVidia from their website. When I was running Quake III from 
GNOME, it crashed. Since then I have problems with GNOME. GNOME failed 
to start next time. So, I swithced to Failsafe GNOME session and it got 
started. After that even if I go into the normal sessions, the GNOME 2 
window decorations are gone. I am getting the "Crux" window decoration 
(GNOME 1) as default. Even if I try switching between GTK 2 themes, the 
same window decoration (Crux) remains persistent and only the UI look 
and feel changes. What could be wrong? Should I force install GNOME 
components again to recover?

PS: Now, almost all the games are running without crash. Also, the 
system seems to be pretty stable.

Did  you try  debugging the  problem by  moving your  .gconf, .gconfd,
.gnome* away?

The best thing would be, in  my opinion, to use something lighter than
GNOME. GNOME is  just too complex and fragile  (atleast from the GNOME
1.4  I  used  to   use).  Sawfish  is  my  always-recommended  choice,
especially if you love customising things :)

cheers,

hi,

i was watching the cricket match and in between
the overs, saw an IBM ad .. on LINUX !! this is=20
the first ad i have ever seen on LINUX on TV.=20
and it had a very _geeky_ appearence.

it showed a small child. He went east, then west=20
then south and then north and .. well you should
see the ad urself.

the ad ended with the lines - "Linux is everywhere,
the future is open"

great ad!! soon coming to a TV near you ;)

Nice thing Suraj, but I would simply do:

scp -r . remote.host:/path

Also, unlike the most popular belief tar doesn't restore permissions
unless the -p option is supplied.

Sorry to reply to myself... looks like the transcript below is a different
ad; what Saha is referring to is probably the one in the third link above.

Oh, and BTW, I hope the people who usually go "COMMERCIAL == TEH EVIL!!!" 
will reconsider their position.

  Or just try creating a new user to see if it works.  If it works, then

If there are a lot of small files, then it would save time as well.
Copying each file would have a significant latency if one of the

the tar writes directly to stdout, not to a file. So the saving time
is not possible. You can see the glitches when the files are off-site,
only when you tar to a local file the time saving is achieved by
transfering the tarred file.

Yeah., this has been around a while., but when corporates do this it
really makes me scared about their motives.. 

IBM opening up the Power5 chip design (selectively) looks like a good
sign., but we've to wait to see how things are coming up.

Are you doing it as root?? Are you getting the "Operation not permitted 
message"? I am assuming that you are doing it as root because of the $ 
in the prompt. It would be helpful if you could post the exact response 
of the system. When I try to insert a module as a normal user this is 
what happens.

[net in nataraj@nutsbox]$ insmod ./8139too.ko
insmod: error inserting './8139too.ko': -1 Operation not permitted

Yeah i too watched this ad. Even though that clipping appears less than a
second, it seem some people like you and me are watching those things
very carefully, like, where linux is coming? and where there is any open
software coming on TV?. I am really frustrated to see the microsoft
softwares shown on TV. Whenever they show sites they simply show it on
IE. Sometime I see Mozilla in some technology programmes in BBC (in
"ClickOnline").

Hi,

The '&&' in the command is a very useful feature.
It is used in the following format...
command1 && command2 && command3 && ....
In the above example, command2 is executed if and only if
command1 is executed successfully. command3 is executed
if and only if command2 is executed successfully.
This feature is really useful while writing shell scripts.

I'm sure you can as long as there's a GUI or web based interface that 
you test it ...

I've seen it used to test mainframe based apps, at any rate (or at least 
my wife uses it - I'm not into QA)

Is your 2.6 kernel installation correct and complete. Does it support
modules? Do you have the required version of module-init-tools? Compile
and load the same module in a 2.4 kernel and check what happens.

Why? What do you think they will do to linux? Make it proprietary?
Control it? Buy it out? 

They can't do any of these things. The code is out there, its free.
No one can control it. The GPL ensures that. There's nothing to 
wait and see.

Obviously IBM's motive is monetary profit. No one thinks they're doing
this out of philosophical conviction. But nothing they can do can
harm linux. And so far, whatever they have done has greatly helped
it.

This kind of anti-corporate paranoia/zealotry helps no one. Please
desist.

May I remind you that IBM spent a billion dollars on linux in 1999?
Yes, billion. And that it employs > 100 kernel hackers? Dozens in
India. And of course hundreds more in linux-related jobs. I think 
many people on this list were wondering how one makes money from
Free Software. Well, this is how. Please don't bite the hand that
feeds you.

Thank you.

You can convert the pst to an mbox file and then import that mbox into 
evolution.

Plenty of converters available online, or easiest way would be to import 
outlook mail into eudora (which stores mail as mbox) and then open that 
in Evolution.

Produce logs, grab mail from the spool etc.

Very likely that either your clients are spamming (running bulkmail 
scripts on the server) or their passwords have been stolen.

Message-ID: <LAEEKJKAGLFCOHMNNIINCECJCPAA.rajendran@xerago.com>

I got unsolicited mail today, about (closed)software sales at a website
called ratedoem.
http://ratedoem.info  is the URL.

Just wanted to know if you guys have ever been to the site, whether what the
site does is above-board and legal...

And, interestingly, they say, a product, for example, MS Windows XP 2002 is
271 dollars (shelfprice) and not 40 dollars (their price) only because of
the promised tech-support, the beautiful box package, and the printed
manuals. Could that be true?

Thanks in advance.

Rajendran.

It is called OEM software - software that is distributed with something 
else (like when you buy a motherboard, or a new PC etc)

Redistribution of that sort of thing is not always legal - if it was 
microsoft software being advertised in spam, fw it to piracy@microsoft.com

Till now, I used to push my pst on a rewritable or zipdisk and take them
home during weekends. Now that I have moved to Linux at home............

Leaving mail on Server is not an entertainable option.
Nor do I think a Windows port is available for Evolution.

Excuse me? The current version of GNOME is 2.6. How can you judge it 
based on what it was like some 4 years back? Especially considering that
Gnome2 was a complete about-face and change of philosophy.

Arvind, you haven't seen Suraj's GUI setup. But I have seen it. His 
setup is more efficient and user-friendly than GNOME 2.6 or whatever. 
GUI not only needs that Windowish look but it should do a lot more than 
that. If you look at Suraj's box, you will change your sig to "A window 
manager can do more than a desktop environment".

Evolution is much faster than Mozilla Thunderbird and uses lesser
memory.  Also, Evolution is more integrated with GNOME while Mozilla
uses its own widget set and essentially stands out from the rest of the
applications.
Evolution 1.5.5 now has Junk mail control too!

By just looking at the IP address, you can't say whether that box is 
Windows or Linux or whatever. But doing a portscan can reveal it. For 
instance, you can use nmap with OS detect switch (-O). This is usually 
done by TCP/IP fingerprinting. This will work out for major OSs.

A portscan of my PC (Runs Windows 2000) gave...

# nmap -sS -PT -PI -O -T 3 praveenk.xxx.xxxxxxx.com
Starting nmap V. 3.00 ( www.insecure.org/nmap )

Wow. Email client war :-) I've trouble connecting to the SMTP server
using Gnus, otherwise could have joined with the Emacs pitch :-)

Regarding Outlook-to-mbox, this HOWTO might be useful:
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/text/Outlook-to-Unix-Mailbox

Question: anyone know how to do SMTP AUTH with Gnus?

Hi,

Certificates generated using openssl are x.509 standard complaint. So it 
doesn't matter in which platform, you are going to use that. Using openssl 
'ca' cmd, you can setup your own root CA certificate.

If you using windows, You can also get OpenSSL binary for windows from this 
url.

hi
 
well i am trying to make some of my dll's which have been compiled for web serivces  using the compiler which comes along with the .net framework.
 
I am trying to use Apache as my webserver, authenticate each users by OpenSSL win32 release....Now some reading has made me aware that Apache has some webservice projects going on and support ASP with perl as the preferred scripting language.
 
Say, i have the user authenticated and then using the ASP perl scripting  run the dll to access the database and publish the query on a browser? 
 
will all this be possible using the win32 binaries and excute a dll which has been compiled usisng the .NET framekwork?
 
i might be worng with the concept...just in the researching phase...
 
looking forward to suggestions...
 
thank you

When you run conventional mail servers (without virtual hosting), then 
adding normal UNIX users will create a mail account for them. For 
instance, if your server is bar.com and you add an UNIX user named 
'foo', then his e-mail id is foo@bar.com (Should have an MX entry in the 
DNS server). If you are using virtual hosting, you are most likely 
running ensim (widely used). If so, goto the ensim control panel and 
create users.

I think that tripwire is capable of doing it. Why don't you check with 
the tripwire manual?

Yes. We need some volunteers. Presently Dosai is trying to keeping it 
alive. If possible someone can develope the site in off line and 
upload it in single short.

Message-ID: <1081355694.23930.184063531@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hi,
 Basic doubt. if i need riyaz.com.. i check if the domain name is
 available and then when i register the domain, who allocates the IP for
 my domain?

Now if i have uploaded the webpages to a server somewhere, and
considering i want to run a webserver from my house for a change, now can
i run registered domain from my house directly.

what i am trying to ask is how does this IP thing work in this case. if
ip is allocated to the system where the domain can be found , then do u
have to register for a new ip when u change the location of the website?

I know my questions arent very clear but i could figure out a better way
to put it. morever i do not know exact meaning & usage of the word
'domain', so bear with it C:

Mail me off list, since it's off topic.

Thnaks

No one allocates IP for your domain. You just own your domainname. You
go to some webhosting service provider (or your home) and host your
domain there.

You own the domain. You would have registered your domain with someone
like namecheap.com or verisign, etc. You can tell them which DNS server
handles your domain. So you have to set up a DNS server which maps the
domain name to IP.

 Thanks for the response all of u , but the sad part is that even in text
files there is no compatiblity between vaious systems
only html & pdf seems to be the near perfect modes which offer compatibility
across diff systems. what abt latex ????
i dont know much abt it ?????

Actually you can also buy dedicated IP's for your domain, ( more
expensive) in case the need requires. However most of the services use
virtual hosting to host multiple domains to the same IP

you go to any webhosting provider (say http://www.pair.com) and get hosting
from them - hey provide you with IP and dns records.

set up free dns at http://www.granitecanyon.com and then if you have a static
ip at your house, point the domain to that static IP.

if you have a dynamic ip or a slow link it might be better for you to just
get it hosted at a webhost.

I am using redhat9.

i want to keep track of file changes. Any tools that can track the 
files(under specific directory) and send mail automatically.

i read about tripwire. Is there any way i can tell tripwire to track 
changes of all files in a directory recursively.

Any help Appreciated.

Since the whole point is to give the Gnu project due credit and remind 
us about the project goals, mentioning about RMS and Gnu/Linux  in the 
.sig  partly fulfills the objectives :)

I can manage creating (new) ilugc website.  That's what I was trying to
explain about using CMS.  After 2 weeks my semester exams will get over. 
I can work during the holidays for site creation.
How about that?

Message-ID: <39810.203.197.138.167.1081352982.squirrel@cs.annauniv.edu>

I am workinig on a client/server project.  Now I have planned to write a
corresponding webclient.  In my system, when a client requests, the server
won't reply back immediately (except for ack), instead it will notify the
client sometime back..  and for this the client will run another server,
that will get the server responses.
The problem comes when I tried to think this in terms of webclient.  How
is this ("event-notification") possible from client browser. (Oh, no I am
not taking about refreshing the browser window repeatedly).
I remember the interface of Yahoo! briefcase fileuploads.  It displayed a
animated progress bar.  No contest was loading at that time (i.e. the
browser progress bar was idle).  But after sometime (after the file got
uploaded), a new page got loaded (finished uploading).
The restriction is, I shouldn't open/connect to any port other than 80 on
client side (so no socket stuffs in javascript?!).

I think the real problem is that it is necessary to ssh to the webserver
rather than having a web-based interface. What about setting up a wiki?
That way everyone can contribute as much time as they are willing to spend.
Note: A wiki *is* a CMS.

Use
dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
to reconfigure the server. Before that make sure that
u hav installed all the required packages for X. 
or else open ur /etc/X11/XF86config file and edit it
by hand.

We are having a RAS server in Win NT with 4 modems conntected to com ports and 4 global IPs. But I don't know how this had been setup in NT. I want to switch this setup to Fedora.
 
I found mgetty, but I am not sure about configuring it. Should I assign 4 global IPs for 4 modems and if so how. can you give some help on configuring it.

Take off encryption,
enable wins and then try with any non-root user and see if that works

Why not try something like postnuke ??

It would make life for the administrator very very easy
There is nothing wrong in going in for a CMS 

We can add or remove modules later
There are several sites which are using PHP nuke 

They have far far far more increased functionality including poll
engines, SMS engines, address books, comments, email interfaces, wiki
etc

what kernel have you chosen ? bf24 ?
by the way i810 has 4MB video and it is growable to 16MB
so if it makes any difference change that in the config file

Try using a less outdated kernel and XFree86 version (well, try using a 
less outdated distro - say slackware 9.1) and it should help.

What is the model of your monitor? 800x600 @ 60 Hz is pretty low end. 
Your's should be atleast 800x600 @ 60 Hz (If Samtron 45B 14'') or 
1024x768 @ 60 Hz (If Samtron 55E 15''). Try changing this. It should 
definetly work out.

Try going for 16 bit color depth instead.

See none of your 800x600 is supported because your monitor doesn't 
support it (You informed it that way).

Don't use kernel's framebuffer interface. It sucks in I810. (By defualt, 
the kernel don't have I810 framebuffer, you have to path it instead). 
So, disable 'fb' module.

To sum up, try

1. Set you monitor parameters properly. Better read the monitor manual 
(or it will be displayed on the monitor box) and go for advanced mode to 
be more precise. Or atleast set it to 800x600 @ 70 Hz.

2. Decrease color depth to 16 and give a try.

3. Remove 'fb' module.

Things should be fine then I hope.

PS: Kernel shouldn't be matter at all for this error. Don't change your 
kernel. But kernel 2.4 is always advisible over 2.2. Kernel 2.4 binaries 
are present in Debian 3.0 itself.

HTH.

I fixed the problem. The broblem was 'sawfish' was starting instead of 
'metacity'. Since 'sawfish' is GNOME 1's I got old window decorations. I 
don't know how it happened. I changed the window manage to metacity by 
editing the session configuration. Now this are pretty fine.

  As said by Arvind, it should also be better to go for something like
  Wiki, though there is a little about the funtionality (like that in
  Postnuke) with WikiCMS.

MediaWiki (http://freshmeat.net/projects/mediawiki/) is currently
far ahead of the others in terms of features and ease of editing.

  So finally I used,

  wget -p -r -np http://gentoo.org/doc/en

  * -p: also download any images,.. linked from the pages downloaded
  * -r: recurse - default depth is 5
  * -np: Download from the directory given, no parent files

  Well, consider this scenario.  I have downloaded files using the default
  depth (5). Now I wish to download from mutually exclusively levels, say
  6-8.  How to do that?

  Another thing I am worried about is, I am downloading the docs in our
  server.  The remaining space is little (~0.8 GB).  I hope files in
  www.gentoo.org/docs/en won't exceed this size!  Is their anyway to calculate this size before?

While configuring the X server, a question like "Should I use the 
kernel's framebuffer interface?" will be asked. Say no to it. Or else, 
unselect 'fb' module in the list of modules to be loaded.

what happens when new mail arrives inbetween your 'cat' and your 'echo'
commands?  You end up clobbering it.  Were mailbox updating this easy, I
would be writing MTAs/MDAs/MUAs ;-)

Updating mail boxes requires carefull file locking to avoid simultaneous
updates (by mta/mda, mua, etc).  Add NFS with it's broken file locking
and it's a HUGE headache.

Since the OP has root access, it's best to shutdown the MTA for a few
seconds and ensure other precautions before performing this procedure.

Procmail can be put to work if the above is infeasible.

Also note,
    echo "" > mbox
creates a one byte file and creates a possibly invalid mbox.  To
truncate a file to zero bytes in bash, I typically do -
    :> filename

FAM may not be the tool for the job.

Think of a file manager like application that needs to refresh its
display automatically when the currently viewing directory changes.
FAM is primarily aimed at supporting such applications.  Here is what
the SGI website has to say -

 GUI tools should not mislead the user; they should display the current
 state of the system, even when changes to the system originate from
 outside of the tools themselves. FAM helps make GUI tools more usable
 by notifying them when the files they're interested in are created,
 modified, executed, and removed.

On a personal note, the original SGI famd has poor security track
record.  I would strongly recommend against famd whenever possible.

Tripwire is the perfect tool for the job.  Read the manuals.

If you are using xdm add the following line to /etc/X11/xdm/Xstartup.

    xmessage -file /etc/motd -geometry 640x480

For xdm clones (gdm, kdm, etc) adjust appropriately.

Thanks for the link.  I've used Twiki and phpwiki, but MediaWiki beats
everything.  I'm downloading it now!

More than the wiki engine itself, the content is equally important.
Good content is very valuble not only for our own lug, but also the
greater community at large.  I have found answers for several of my
problems at the Wellington Lug Wiki -
    http://www.wlug.org.nz/

The "User Submitted Notes" section is outstanding -
    http://www.wlug.org.nz/UserSubmittedNotes

I request for a similar section in our Wiki.  I'm happy to contribute
whatever I can to such a section.

Yes, thanks for the link, Arvind!  MediaWiki sure has an amazing
featureset!  I've only used MoinMoin.

My only concern with the Wiki is that someone has to keep a watch
ocassionally and make sure vandals (if any) are banned.  The content
also needs to be watched so nothing egregious is said or nothing with
a strong personal bias. 

Good luck!

Easy to do in a distributed fashion! I'll volunteer. I have some 
experience with that, being an admin on wikipedia. I'll also 
volunteer to do things like summarize mailing list traffic on
the website, etc.

  Well, I am not sure whether that has CLI.  But I am comfortable with
  wget now!
  I tried searching for web interface for wget downloads - got one - and
  the package was corrupted.  So I am planning to write one myself,
  probably using my favourite programming language, Python.

I got introduced to Free Software at the Banglore IT.COM 2000, and for
what it is worth I share that experience here.

The IT.COM event  was given very wide publicity  in the newspapers and
magazines.  At  the show entrance, volunteers  registered the visitors
through terminals,  and gave  an ID  Card that could  be worn,  a jute
carry  bag  and a  CD  titled  IT.COM  upon registration.   Well,  the
Registration fees was Rs.  100/- or  so [no free lunch].  The show was
many times bigger  that what Meera Dynamic does every  now and then in
Chennai,  but size  hardly matters  - there  was just  one  large Free
Software pavilion with the banner `Linux', where demos, talks, selling
cd's etc were  all happening at the same time.   The Pavilion was like
this: [please use emacs/vi to view]

+                   +================================+   
                    +

The entire pavilion was literally free and open, with light partitions
to demarcate areas.  The terminals were showing off the nice tools and
games available on KDE.  Some  neat drawings were displayed on the CAD
terminals.  Rugged hardware machinery running the clusters were on the
floor,  unlike the  dainty PC's  that  sat on  desks.  The  volunteers
explained things  crisply, allowed  me to try  a few things,  and gave
pamplets.   This was  the first  time I  came face  to face  with free
software, and was immediately convinced  about it, and wanted to start
using it.  While walking out, I purchased a few distros - Mandrake and
some others for about Rs.100/-.

I  came back home  and tried  installing the  distros.  I  could never
install X  with the  hardware I had  then, and  could only get  to the
command prompt.  I  meanwhile got `Setting up a  Linux Server - Visual
Black  Book- Step-By-Step  Visual  Guide' by  Hide  Tsuji and  Takashi
Wantanabe, published by dreamtech Press  and got a good picture of the
things possible.  Simple commands like  cat *.txt and grep thrilled me
to no end.  Later, I had another occasion to visit Bangalore, and this
time went  in for  the SuSE  7.0 box, which  met all  my requirements.
With help from the book and the box, I set up a usable server.

Over the past 4 years, I  have downloaded sources from the internet or
got  CDs  to update  the  tools I  use.   Learning  and updating  free
software is virtually without limits, and so we are here, I guess.
 
HTH :)

My experience with servers is limited, so take whatever I say 
with a pinch of salt.

That said, my opinion is defintely NO. First, Fedora is not intended
to be used for servers. They focus more on getting the desktop to
work right. Further, I'm not sure they iron out all the bugs before
shipping. I've seen weird behavior with the panel in gnome, for example.
On the server side, I know of one particularly horrible bug in grep
in Fedora, for that matter in RH9 as well: it takes exponential time
when the encoding is UTF-8 (default in RH9/Fedora). I've also been on
the Fedora mailing lists and IRC, and frankly, the QA process doesn't
assure much confidence. They're kind of working out the organizational
structure and things like that, and it looks like it will take another
release cycle or two before things fall smoothly in line.

On the other hand, to get bleeding edge releases of desktop software
with supremely sane defaults (I hate wasting time customizing things)
I'd go with Fedora any day.

those are minor buglets - and setting the encoding to anything other 
than utf-8 is a "better idea" for various other reasons, such as at 
least some perl scripts.

fc-1 has a solid kernel, a solid fs.  Those two are the basics.

Hi,
Well, regarding the internal modem, it is difficult to set up. I have
tried a lot but it never worked. If ur bent upon making it
work..google.com or http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/ shd help.

also read
http://www.pcquest.com/content/search/showarticle.asp?arid=37911&way=search
for internal modems.

The external modem shdnt be a problem at all. Its like plug and play.
Read

And please google before u ask. Most of the info can be found on the
internet

IMHO the grep issue is no 'buglet'. You do realize that it could
cause scripts to hang, right? It happened to me, that's how I
came to know of it.

Perhaps, but in that case they should fix the bug in grep. It was
reported before FC1 was released.

Incidentally, defaulting to utf-8 also messes things up for apache 2.
(Although I think that's largely apache's fault.) See
http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2004-January/007643.html
for an example of how this affected a 'production server'.

Sure, but there are sooo many other things that could go wrong (gcc 2.96 :-).

Twofoxes, a South African company, has announced the release of

The company says the Open Source construction kits, which can either be
downloaded from the website or ordered, contain all the software
required for an NGO's operation. Dror Eyal, founder of Twofoxe, says
the collections are the starting points for companies wanting to shift
to, or start running an Open Source solution. "You will obviously want
to tailor them and/or add various bits and pieces to them as per your
specific needs. However these kits are the basic building blocks to get

Are there programs or scripts that can routinely check and evaluate the 
usability of a distro?

My sys runs on an AMD Duron, and when I try installing Fedora Core 
supplied with LFY, I always end up with the `kernel panic error' in the 
middle of the installation, as was the case with Shirke.  Once I was 
able to complete the installation - but invariably the system hanged in 
the middle for the same reason.  The omnious sign of the kernel panic on 
my sys is a frozen screen  with the NumLock and ScrollLock leds flashing 
on the keyboard.

Regards,
Ram anraj.

I did run the media check on both the cds before installation when asked 
by fedora and no errors were reported.  

I had the same symptoms and trouble with the previous distros and when 
installation is done on the text mode,  installation breaks after 
sometime with this:

CPU 0: Machine Check Exception 0000000004
Bank 1: b6000000000181 at 000084314bc0
Kernel Panic : CPU Context Corrupt


I was thinking if the kernel is ok and if it is possible to compile the 
kernel everything else should work fine.

search the redhat / fedora bugzilla - you should find something relevant

Message-ID: <1081658877.3404.78.camel@RameshKumar.altosys.org>

Dear Friends, 

Installation of Oracle Application Server 10g (9.0.4) On RedHat Advanced
Server 3.0 RHEL is a diffcult job. 

This is a Small helpfull notes and documentaion for the above needy.



      Oracle Application Server 10g (9.0.4) Installation On RedHat
      ============================================================
                        Advanced Server RHEL 3.0 
                        ========================


In this article I'll describe the installation of Oracle Application
Server 10g (9.0.4) for Portal, Oracle's standards-based portal
development and deployment solution, on RedHat Advanced Server 3.0. 

The article assumes you've performed the standard advanced server
installation including the development tools.

Download the following software:

      * Oracle Application Server 10g (9.0.4) Software
      * Patch 3006854

Unpack Files: 
=============
First unzip the files: 
======================

        gunzip ias904_linux_disk1.cpio.gz
        gunzip ias904_linux_disk2.cpio.gz
        gunzip ias904_linux_disk3.cpio.gz
        gunzip ias904_linux_disk4.cpio.gz
        
Next unpack the contents of the files: 
======================================

        cpio -idmv < ias904_linux_disk1.cpio
        cpio -idmv < ias904_linux_disk2.cpio
        cpio -idmv < ias904_linux_disk3.cpio
        cpio -idmv < ias904_linux_disk4.cpio
        
        
You should now have four directories (Disk1, Disk2, Disk3 & Disk4)
containing installation files.

Editing the Hosts File : 
========================

The /etc/hosts file must contain a fully qualified name for the server: 

        <IP-address>  <fully-qualified-machine-name>  <machine-name>

Set Kernel Parameters: 
======================

Add the following lines to the /etc/sysctl.conf file: 
        kernel.shmall = 2097152
        kernel.shmmax = 2147483648
        kernel.shmmni = 142
        # semaphores: semmsl, semmns, semopm, semmni
        kernel.sem = 256 32000 100 142
        fs.file-max = 131072
        net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 20000 65000
        kernel.msgmni = 2878 
        kernel.msgmax = 8192 
        kernel.msgmnb = 65535
        
Run the following command to change the current kernel parameters: 
==================================================================

        /sbin/sysctl -p


Add the following lines to the /etc/security/limits.conf file where ->
represents the tab character: 

        * -> -> soft -> nproc -> -> 2047
        * -> -> hard -> nproc -> -> 16384
        * -> -> soft -> nofile -> -> 2048
        * -> -> hard -> nofile -> -> 16384

Add the following line to the /etc/pam.d/login file, if it does not
already exist: 

        session    required     /lib/security/pam_limits.so

        set -o emacs

Infrastructure Installation: 
============================

Log into the oracle user. If you are using X emulation then set the
DISPLAY environmental variable: 

        DISPLAY=<machine-name>:0.0; export DISPLAY

Start the Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) by issuing the following
command in the Disk1 directory: 
        
        ./runInstaller

During the installation select the appropriate ORACLE_HOME for
infrastructure (904_infra) and select the infrastructure installation.

Post Infrastructure Installation: 
=================================

On completion of the infrastructure installation connect to the
Enterprise Manager Website (http://<fully-qualified-machine-name>:1810)
using the username "ias_admin" and the password you assigned during the
installation. If EM is not available start it with the "emctl start
iasconsole" command. Check that all the components are started before
proceeding to the portal installation. 


Portal Installation:
====================

Log into the oracle user. If you are using X emulation then set the
DISPLAY environmental variable: 
        
        DISPLAY=<machine-name>:0.0; export DISPLAY

Start the Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) by issuing the following
command in the Disk1 directory: 

        ./runInstaller
        
During the installation select the appropriate ORACLE_HOME for portal
(portal) and select the application server installation, with the portal
and wireless option.


Post Portal Installation: 
=========================

On completion of the portal installation connect to enterprise manager
and check the portal components are all started before you proceed to
test portal.

Portal Usage:
============

With all the services running you can start using portal at the
following URL:

http://<fully-qualified-machine-name>:7778/pls/portal

The port number for portal can vary depending on the installation but it
is recorded in the "portal/Apache/Apache/setupinfo.txt" file.

Once at this page you can login using either "portal", the portal DBA
user, or "portal_admin", the portal administrator user. The passwords
will be the value assigned during the installation.

Starting and Stopping Services:
===============================

It is recommended that the services are always started and stopped using
Enterprise Manager Website. If this cannot be done for some reason they
can be started and stopped manually as follows: 
        
        # Start everything
        dbstart
        lsnrctl start
        agentctl start
        oidmon start
        oidctl server=oidldapd instance=1 configset=1 start
        dcmctl start -cl
        emctl start iasconsole
        
        # Stop everything
        emctl stop iasconsole
        dcmctl shutdown
        oidctl server=oidldapd instance=1 configset=1 stop
        oidmon stop
        agentctl stop
        lsnrctl stop
        dbshut


I hope that the above notes helps and find easy to install Oracle
Application Server 10g (9.0.4) for the Portal On RedHat Advanced Server
3.0.

Both Drupal and wiki sound good to me. How do we decide?

Message-ID: <7FA74F140B180D478F3E5942BDFBADAC28695A@chnmsg02.gavsin.com>

hi,

i have installed a new VIA C3, a MAXTOR 30Gb HDD and=20
64 Mb SDRAM in my PC. The PC hosts a secondhand 810e=20
motherboard.

Problem is that the PC sometimes unexpectedly reboots.
i am not able to find the reason. My initial observation
is that it reboots when load is high on the HDD. Like,
while i was installing Fedora, it rebooted when the=20
installation was 7% complete. I ran the PC for 5 hours
on Knoppix, after disconnecting the HDD.=20

However, i was able to successfully install the Debian
3.0 base, which took some 15 min to install. And i can=20
boot into it now. But after login in, while i was=20
installing gcc, the PC rebooted halfway thru the=20
installation.

Any tool to know if there is any defect in the HDD,=20
which would make it trip the PC ? Any other clue ?

Apache can run over ipv6 if that's what you are asking.

Setting up IPSEC links - that's at the network level, not at the 
application level.

  Excuse me.  But how do actually specify a range of levels.

            o
         1      1
        2  2      2
      3  3   3   3   3

   I know the URL for level 0, and if I only want the files at level 2 and
   3 refered (indirectly) from level 0, what should I do?

  Not quite heavy.  With wiki, (I think) we can only go on add/remove/edit
  pages.  What about a real modular CMS.  We should evaluate both CMS's
  and Wiki's.

Do you hear beeps upon high activity?  If so, check the temparature
control setting in your BIOS settings.  Set it to saner values or
disable it.

Doesn't make sense. How can you even find the URLs at levels 2 and 3 without
downloading the pages at level 1?

   I does, bcoz I have downloaded the files till level k before, and now I
   want to resume my action from level k to some other level say m.
   Well, seems like a solution exist, just recursively list the downloaded
   files and wget from them using level m-k-1

Hi all,
Debian 3.0rc2, XFree86 comes with < 4.4.x . It is known that XFree 4.3.x has some problems with i810 motherboards. This has been reported to be fixed in latest 4.4.x versions. just initially download Xinstall.sh (xfree86.org) script and run it,which will probe ur box and  tellu which version to download and install. but pls try to install the latest version AFAP. then u can install either binaries or compile it urself. both are well documented at Xfree86.org. Now i run debian 3.0rc2  with Xfree 4.4.2 with gnome - and its cool.

This month ILUGC meet some intresting "flavours".
 
We had 2 talks. 
Talk 1 :: Network Scanning  
         By  Mr. Phani Kumar, DONLab, IIT-M and 
Talk 2 :: SubVersion 
          By Venki and CollabNet Team.  <But, the team had only one person!> 
 
We discussed about INSTALL FEST '04. We discussed about the topics to be INSTALLed.We just decided to have that FESTival on 2nd week of May,of course '04.
The Venue and exact date have to be decided. Probably, we will decide it in the next month meet or before that...

 
Then, we had our regular 'Introduce YourSelf' stuff. Some of the old members of the group had a chance to remember their name and their position. And, of course, Freshers introduced them to the group.
 
Then, we had something called Queries section. 
We had some intresting doubts from the freshers and it had been answered by experts.. Just one doubt and the answer given is available at the end .. 
 
Throughout the meeting, we had some delicious "chats" and "snacks"  <But, no one washed their hands before entering the Tenet Seminar hall.>, ooopss.... just read the next line....
Bcaz, we had food for thought!
 
Then, everyone rushed to sign their "autographs" in a magic paper called Attendance sheet. 
 
Then, 
We will meet in the next month ILUGC MEET.

Subject: [Ilugc] [OT] How to unblock e-mail address??
Message-ID: <20040412183210.6617.qmail@web60610.mail.yahoo.com>

Hallo all,
         I`ve mistakenly selected all read mails in my
Rediffmail inbox and instead of clicking on "delete" I
clicked on the "Spam" button and now the e-mail
addresses are blocked and that includes ilugc digest
too!!

The godforsaken server does not seem to be responding
to the unblock request, is there any other way of
unblocking it??

I set a filter to redirect ilugc digest mails to my
inbox, but even that doesnt seem to work!!
The rediff customer care is just a dummy service and
has never ever responded!! Is there a way out??

Reply individual mails to: sudharsan@rediffmail.com

Kindly help.

Hi!

I am a new member to the Chennai LUG. I have few
distro CDs with me:

SuSE Linux 9.0
Gentoo Linux 1.4
Red Hat 9.0
FreeBSD Unix 4.9

I don't have the option of adding them in:

http://www.chennailug.org/cds4grab.php

If the moderator can add them with my email-id:
cyborg4k@yahoo.com, it will be useful to members.
Maybe we can make one copy for the LUG and members can
make copies from it? We can work that out.

I will be returning to India in June and will like to
attend the meetings and discussions (if I am stationed
in Chennai). Even if I am not present in Chennai, I
would like to contribute to the Chennai LUG mailing
list.

I've been using Linux for over 6 years and now I have
completely moved to Linux/Unix,

Cheers,

K Shakthi

Maybe those are the wrong permissions?  You typically shouldn't make any 
webserver accessible directories 777 anyway.

 hi i have made it 777 both the directory and the files under the 
directory......i am wodnering..say when i type on the browser 
http://192.168.0.30/mantis it gives me the error, i checked the 
httpd.conf file ServerAdmin root@localhost DocumentRoot 
/root/vinoo/mantis-0.18.2 ServerSignature email DirectoryIndex 
index.php  index.html index.htm index.shtml LogLevel debug HostNameLookups off 
and 


 also checked the mantis app conf file 

$g_path =  'http://192.168.0.30/mantis/';

 $g_absolute_path =  '/root/vinoo/mantis-0.18.2'; still i get the same error...... 

Maybe those are the wrong permissions?  You typically shouldn't make 
any 
webserver accessible directories 777 anyway.

Subject: [Ilugc] Directory Tree Utility
Message-ID: <1081850868.3229.21.camel@ppe>

Hi,

In the process of learning to use/program under linux (still
learning...), i wrote a small utility to list the tree structure of a
given directory. I found it quite userful (as a linux newbie) to
visualise the directory structures of the OS and other apps in my
system.

Anybody who thinks it might be useful to them can download it from
 
http://www.ppeindia.com/tree/tree-0.1.tar 

The tar contains the source and the makefile. The binary is also
included.

use it like...

./tree [directory name]
to list the tree of files and directories.

./tree [directory name] -d
to list the tree of directories alone.

./tree -h
to show the help file.

Please let me know of any bugs and suggestions!

Arun

How about http://pinzet.sourceforge.net/ ?

You can find some other alternatives from http://richtech.ca/seul/

Im sure you  should be able to hire some  freelancer and customise one
of these as well :)

This would be a highly customised application, depending on the rules 
framed by the institution for evaluating performance of students.  I 
guess, this would also involve study of the Education Code to generate 
forms as prescribed.

If you can hack and work with the scripts I have written for my Calpp 
project, that is still in the _BETA_ stage, it might help you.  Calpp is 
for executing rules and procedures in general.  My last four summer 
vacations were spent writing the code, and I do hope, this summer I can 
finish writing the code and documentation.

Calpp runs on systems installed with Apache, PHP 4 and PostgreSQL. 
 Calpp basically provides a framework for storing procedures and 
executing them as proceedings.  Forms could be generated to collect, 
validate and store data for generating reports or doing analysis.  Calpp 
is licensed under the GPL and if some procedures are written pursuant to 
this for your school, may be other schools could also get to use them. 
 I do spend some part of my vacation at Salem, which is my native too, 
and would be glad to get involved in developing procedures that could be 
used to run schools, according to the TN Education Code.

Please do visit my personal home page at 
http://personal.vsnl.com/ramanraj for links to the Calpp project.

Regards,
Ramanraj.

All that they can do is charge lot of money for
products that don't work or have lot of bugs in it:
"Failure is not an option, it comes bundled with your
Micro$oft product" :)

Move to open source. Freedom at last. You can find lot
of projects from:

To access hard disk file, you just have to do basic
file operation. All devices are treated as files and
hence you should open the device as a file. Check this

There is always flash support for linux. I use Firefox
and I can view flash on it. There are also open source
flash for linux projects:

Subject: [Ilugc] MDK10.0 ok for production server ?
Message-ID: <407C186A.1000801@ntc.net.np>

Any notable security/stability/reliability issues with Mandrake 10.0 ? 
I am thinking about using it for our intranet server (since that is the 
latest disto I have apart from RH9.0 and MDK9.1).

The server will basically run sshd, apache, ftpd, NIS, NFS(all /home NFS 
mounted from the server), squid, pppd, and may be samba for our college 
lab with 40 PCs.  Also, it will be routing between 2 of our labs and the 
Internet (will have some IPTables scripts to filter).

Will MDK10.0 ok for this ?  Any other suggestiongs ?

Another question:

Did anyone notice any problem with reiserfs in MDK9.1 ?  In 2 of our 
machines, the file system got messed up (some files missing, some with 
unrelated content, etc.) after few power-cuts.

Message-ID: <1260.220.226.46.72.1081877217.squirrel@220.226.46.72>


hi!!!

i am using debian woody.

this is the error i most often end up in, when i try to install few
applications.!! for eg..!! i got this error when i tried to install
mozilla-firefox.

... depends on libc6 (>= 2.3.2-1); however:
      Version of libc6 on system is 2.2.5-11.5

Now

1. I googled regarding this, and i found that upgrading libc6 is not a
wise thing to do, coz it has lots of complexities. Switching over to
Debian sarge might help!!! does that mean that for working with firefox,
or for the installation of ymsnger, i should upgrade to sarge or sid??

2. Is there any other means I can make these applications to work in my
current system, without upgrading the libc6. I read something about the
backport. Can anybody help me in this?


Cheers!!!
R K

Debian Woody is completely outdated so you are definitely going to have 
problems compiling anything that requires newer libc6 etc.

Search for a debian package or backport - or better still ditch debian 
woody, move to debian unstable or better still get a more modern and 
usable distro like slackware / gentoo / fedora core 1 etc.

Dear Shaks,
I don't think you can speak thus, on behalf of the open source community.
Friends or foes, it is important to know what is happening next door.
Particularly, when we are talking about a standard for small-foot-print but
visually-rich web-based applications.

About your boast that there is always flash support for Linux, just imagine
what might happen if Micro buys Macro and closes the file-structure of the
next-gen Flash? :-(

Rajendran.

my problem is strange. I am running redhat9. Its acting as NIS, NFS, 
firewall for a network of 15 systems. All systems have individual UPS. 
When there is power failure all systems are working but the server hangs 
and doesn't respond to anything. Nothing in logs. UPS is working ok.

What may be the problem. Any help appreciated.

it is the program for reading from microphone and to

Basically the EU is going to legalize software patents with no
restrictions on what is patentable.

The "ageing/outdated" Debian Woody will do a unbeatable job.  Infact
your installation would typically consume <200MB of disk space.  Contact
me off-list if you need a custom Woody CD that contains all the software
you need.

You should also plan for a bit more redundancy and scalability by
offloading some services to another machine.  Also from a security
standpoint, it would be better if you delegated routing/firewalling
to a different box.

Btw, consider adding a local DNS cache to your list of services and
invest in RAID or atleast mirrored HDDs.

Sending messages in CAPS means you are scolding at the
person reading the message. Try to avoid using CAPS.

There is good documentation online about learning

Hi!

A majority of the development of open source w.r.t. to
interoperability is the splendid work of reverse
engineering. One example is writing device drivers for
various external products. The programmers only know
the brand name, model and chipset. It is the work of
reverse engineering that tells us about the protocols
used by the devices to interact with the systems.

Were the numerous bugs in windoze found (which
continue to exist and are being found) by seeing the
source code? or knowing the internals? No. It was all
simple reverse engineering :)

Now thinking about that (debian) also.  The main problem here is, I am 
not the sys admin and the sys admin doesn't know much about any *nix es. 
  (I have my teaching job and hence cannot spend much time)  So, I want 
to quickly put something in place and then make him learn - he 
definitely needs some GUI.  Do you think webmin would be a good idea ?

The main reason I asked my friend to send me MDK10 was, I want to 
introduce to the students some GNU/Linux & free s/w stuff (They are 
really pathetic - using some unauthorised copies of old TurboC, etc.)  I 
thought that would be the best choice.  So, I mostly will be installing 
MDK in the clients.

The problem here is, we are facing shortage of h/w.  Thats why I am 
constrained to put everything in one machine.  Anyway, I am planning to 
get atleast one more HDD on my own.

I am also trying to move routing to a PII machine - but the CPU fan is 
dead.  Still looking for it.

Yes, named is also on the list.  Mirroring in on the TODO list after I 
manage to get HDDs.

Actually, here we definitely need redundancy, etc. since the h/w we get 
here is so sub-standard.  But at the same time, there are some 
organisational constraints.


Thanks a lot,

Actually, I'm really bad at hardware so hats off to these guys. I'm
really in awe of someone who can reverse engineer this stuff and write
device drivers. I think it'll be sometime before all manufacturers open
up to the idea of supporting Linux..especially, as a lot of them are
still queasy about making their device drivers open source. However,
people like Nvidia and Ati are pretty good in this regard.

Actually, that's the same technique a lot of people use, irrespective of
whether they have access to source.If you're good at assembly, you can
do wonders with software like SoftICE. So, in a way, you do have the
code.

BTW, its Windows and not 'Windoze'. You know, the OS which had less CERT
security alerts than other..ahem...operating systems. :-)

Hi!

A majority of the development of open source w.r.t. to interoperability
is the splendid work of reverse engineering. One example is writing
device drivers for various external products. The programmers only know
the brand name, model and chipset. It is the work of reverse engineering
that tells us about the protocols used by the devices to interact with
the systems.

Were the numerous bugs in windoze found (which
continue to exist and are being found) by seeing the

Does anyone what the current state of affairs in India is? I remember

traditional Indian products. Does anyone have any info on India's legal
situation regarding patents?

Detailed info. at

Basically the EU is going to legalize software patents with no
restrictions on what is patentable.
 

Today there is a protest march in Brussels.

Currently a whole lot better than the US/EU. Both wrt. copyright and
patents. But the key word is currently. I remember reading that in 
2005 India is set to enter into some WTO agreement which would require
implementing the same ridiculous and draconian laws that the US 
pioneered.

Try to make the default policy DROP and open only those ports u want ( 
22 in ur case).

iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

Make sure to open them for ur LAN too.

   That's an appreciated work.  I think now you should look at some of the
   scripting languages available like,  1. Perl
  2. Python (search google for "why python esr" without quotes)
  3. Ruby
  4. ... (even bash)

   A scripting would have achieved this job with few lines of code and few
   minutes of development ;)

Hi,

I have some problems with the user authentication. I have added this to
the httpd.conf (apache-1.3) file.

<Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin/downloader/>
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "Restricted area"
        AuthUserFile /etc/apache/passwd/passwords
        Require user downloader
</Directory>

But on accessing this
http://cs.annauniv.edu/cgi-bin/downloader/index.py

location, it doesn't ask for username/password.  Apache error log was
clean.  What might have gone wrong.
Before that I have created the password file using `htpasswd`.  I followed
everthing given the documentation.
Here is my httpd.conf file

# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://www.apache.org/docs/> for detailed information about
# the directives.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
#
# After this file is processed, the server will look for and process
# /etc/apache/srm.conf and then /etc/apache/access.conf
# unless you have overridden these with ResourceConfig and/or
# AccessConfig directives here.
#
# The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections:
#  1. Directives that control the operation of the Apache server process as a
#     whole (the 'global environment').
#  2. Directives that define the parameters of the 'main' or 'default' server,
#     which responds to requests that aren't handled by a virtual host.
#     These directives also provide default values for the settings
#     of all virtual hosts.
#  3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to
#     different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the
#     same Apache server process.
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "logs/foo.log"
# with ServerRoot set to "/usr/local/apache" will be interpreted by the
# server as "/usr/local/apache/logs/foo.log".
#

### Section 1: Global Environment
#
# The directives in this section affect the overall operation of Apache,
# such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where it
# can find its configuration files.
#

#
# ServerType is either inetd, or standalone.  Inetd mode is only supported on
# Unix platforms.
#
ServerType standalone

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept, unless they are specified
# with an absolute path.
#
# NOTE!  If you intend to place this on an NFS (or otherwise network)
# mounted filesystem then please read the LockFile documentation
# (available at <URL:http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#lockfile>);
# you will save yourself a lot of trouble.
#
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
#
ServerRoot /etc/apache

#
# The LockFile directive sets the path to the lockfile used when Apache
# is compiled with either USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT or
# USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT. This directive should normally be left at
# its default value. The main reason for changing it is if the logs
# directory is NFS mounted, since the lockfile MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL
# DISK. The PID of the main server process is automatically appended to
# the filename. 
#
LockFile /var/lock/apache.lock

#
# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.
#
PidFile /var/run/apache.pid

#
# ScoreBoardFile: File used to store internal server process information.
# Not all architectures require this.  But if yours does (you'll know because
# this file will be  created when you run Apache) then you *must* ensure that
# no two invocations of Apache share the same scoreboard file.
#
ScoreBoardFile /var/run/apache.scoreboard

#
# In the standard configuration, the server will process this file,
# srm.conf, and access.conf in that order.  The latter two files are
# now distributed empty, as it is recommended that all directives
# be kept in a single file for simplicity.  The commented-out values
# below are the built-in defaults.  You can have the server ignore
# these files altogether by using "/dev/null" (for Unix) or
# "nul" (for Win32) for the arguments to the directives.
#
#ResourceConfig /etc/apache/srm.conf
#AccessConfig /etc/apache/access.conf

#
# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
#
Timeout 300

#
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
#
KeepAlive On

#
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
#
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
# same client on the same connection.
#
KeepAliveTimeout 15

#
# Server-pool size regulation.  Rather than making you guess how many
# server processes you need, Apache dynamically adapts to the load it
# sees --- that is, it tries to maintain enough server processes to
# handle the current load, plus a few spare servers to handle transient
# load spikes (e.g., multiple simultaneous requests from a single
# Netscape browser).
#
# It does this by periodically checking how many servers are waiting
# for a request.  If there are fewer than MinSpareServers, it creates
# a new spare.  If there are more than MaxSpareServers, some of the
# spares die off.  The default values are probably OK for most sites.
#
MinSpareServers 5
MaxSpareServers 10

#
# Number of servers to start initially --- should be a reasonable ballpark
# figure.
#
StartServers 5

#
# Limit on total number of servers running, i.e., limit on the number
# of clients who can simultaneously connect --- if this limit is ever
# reached, clients will be LOCKED OUT, so it should NOT BE SET TOO LOW.
# It is intended mainly as a brake to keep a runaway server from taking
# the system with it as it spirals down...
#
MaxClients 150

#
# MaxRequestsPerChild: the number of requests each child process is
# allowed to process before the child dies.  The child will exit so
# as to avoid problems after prolonged use when Apache (and maybe the
# libraries it uses) leak memory or other resources.  On most systems, this
# isn't really needed, but a few (such as Solaris) do have notable leaks
# in the libraries. For these platforms, set to something like 10000
# or so; a setting of 0 means unlimited.
#
# NOTE: This value does not include keepalive requests after the initial
#       request per connection. For example, if a child process handles
#       an initial request and 10 subsequent "keptalive" requests, it
#       would only count as 1 request towards this limit.
#
MaxRequestsPerChild 100

#
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, in addition to the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.
#
#Listen 3000
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80

#
# BindAddress: You can support virtual hosts with this option. This directive
# is used to tell the server which IP address to listen to. It can either
# contain "*", an IP address, or a fully qualified Internet domain name.
# See also the <VirtualHost> and Listen directives.
#
#BindAddress *

### Section 2: 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# <VirtualHost> definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.
#
# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
#

#
# If your ServerType directive (set earlier in the 'Global Environment'
# section) is set to "inetd", the next few directives don't have any
# effect since their settings are defined by the inetd configuration.
# Skip ahead to the ServerAdmin directive.
#

#
# Port: The port to which the standalone server listens. For
# ports < 1023, you will need apache to be run as root initially.
#
Port 80

#
# If you wish apache to run as a different user or group, you must run
# apacheas root initially and it will switch.  
#
# User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run apache as.
#  . On SCO (ODT 3) use "User nouser" and "Group nogroup".
#  . On HPUX you may not be able to use shared memory as nobody, and the
#    suggested workaround is to create a user www and use that user.
#  NOTE that some kernels refuse to setgid(Group) or semctl(IPC_SET)
#  when the value of (unsigned)Group is above 60000; 
#  don't use Group nobody on these systems!
#
User www-data
Group www-data

#
# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
# as error documents.
#
ServerAdmin webmaster@cs

#
# ServerName: allows you to set a host name which is sent back to clients for
# your server if it's different than the one the program would get (i.e., use
# "www" instead of the host's real name).
#
# Note: You cannot just invent host names and hope they work. The name you 
# define here must be a valid DNS name for your host. If you don't understand
# this, ask your network administrator.
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
# You will have to access it by its address (e.g., http://123.45.67.89/)
# anyway, and this will make redirections work in a sensible way.
#
#ServerName new.host.name

#
# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
#
# DocumentRoot /var/www
DocumentRoot /home/webmaster/public_html/html

#
# Each directory to which Apache has access, can be configured with respect
# to which services and features are allowed and/or disabled in that

#
# UseCanonicalName:  (new for 1.3)  With this setting turned on, whenever
# Apache needs to construct a self-referencing URL (a URL that refers back
# to the server the response is coming from) it will use ServerName and
# Port to form a "canonical" name.  With this setting off, Apache will
# use the hostname:port that the client supplied, when possible.  This
# also affects SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT in CGI scripts.
#
UseCanonicalName On

#
# TypesConfig describes where the mime.types file (or equivalent) is
# to be found.
#
TypesConfig /etc/mime.types

#
# DefaultType is the default MIME type the server will use for a document
# if it cannot otherwise determine one, such as from filename extensions.
# If your server contains mostly text or HTML documents, "text/plain" is
# a good value.  If most of your content is binary, such as applications
# or images, you may want to use "application/octet-stream" instead to
# keep browsers from trying to display binary files as though they are
# text.
#
DefaultType text/plain

#
# The mod_mime_magic module allows the server to use various hints from the
# contents of the file itself to determine its type.  The MIMEMagicFile
# directive tells the module where the hint definitions are located.
# mod_mime_magic is not part of the default server (you have to add
# it yourself with a LoadModule [see the DSO paragraph in the 'Global
# Environment' section], or recompile the server and include mod_mime_magic
# as part of the configuration), so it's enclosed in an <IfModule> container.
# This means that the MIMEMagicFile directive will only be processed if the
# module is part of the server.

# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
# e.g., www.apache.org (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off).
# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people
# had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that
# each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the
# nameserver.
#
HostnameLookups Off

# Note that Log files are now rotated by logrotate, not by apache itself.
# This means that apache no longer attempts to magically determine
# where your log files are kept; you have to fill out stanzas in
# /etc/logrotate.d/apache yourself.

#
# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>
# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be
# logged here.  If you *do* define an error logfile for a <VirtualHost>
# container, that host's errors will be logged there and not here.

Besides, there already exists a program called tree. 

$man tree

   Tree is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth
   indented listing of files.

We do have stabiliser and UPS.  Suddenly there will be a lightning 
strike somewhere (or some strong, very-quick fluctuation), and the PC 
will just reboot.  Even if the PC is behind a stabiliser and a UPS, this 
happens many times.  I have seen this behaviour with many brands of UPS. 
  Thats why I am worried about this problem.

Do you think it is a better idea to say "yes" when it asks "do you want 
to check the fs.." while rebooting ?

Is there much difference between the journaling implementation in the 
various file systems ?


(The place I am living in is sometiems called "Nepal's Chirapunji".  The 
sky will be clear and the sun shining.  After 10 minutes, you will be 
having thunder strikes and heavy showers.  And after one hour, you can't 
say that it rained some time back.  So, one can't do anything about it 
as it comes and goes very quickly.)

The problem is that the power does not cut over to the UPS fast enough.

You need a surge suppressor as well - most high quality commercial grade 
/ isp grade power bars / power strips will have these.

> Do you think it is a better idea to say "yes" when it asks "do you want

depends - use a journalling fs like ext3 and you should have less 
problems wrt lost data from power cuts.

that is the character set your email is being sent in

sometimes because of browser related issues when typing in stuff you 
might get some weird high ascii characters inserted into the name ..

just reset your browser's character set to iso-8859-1 or us-ascii and 
then change your name to S.N.Sudharshan again.

Oh! I did not know that.
My system (Fedora core 1) does not have that program. Is there any
standard list of programs which are supposed to be present in a
distribution? Where can i get it from?

Subject: [Ilugc] Kernel Upgrade
Message-ID: <200404151124.QAA09461@WS0005.indiatimes.com>

Hello All,

I know this a topic discussed with high reverence in the list recently. I just have a small doubt.

I have RedHat Linux 9.0 installed on my system and I tried to upgrade it to kernel 2.6.

The steps are pretty much clear thanks to the previous mails. But as soon as i reach the make config (xconfig, menuconfig, oldconfig) things get little confusing. Confusing for me that is not for the system.

I tried with oldconfig but still some of the new features are asked for configuration and i dont know which ones to select as there are really many and which of them should i select to optimize my system.

I am ready to use menuconfig or xconfig but then i would like to know which all modules are currently loaded (how do i come to know this) and would like to retain them. Somebosy please tell me in general how to choose the options. Or please give some valuable pointers.


I have a standalone machine with the following hardware : 
->Intel Pentium 4 1.7 GHz 256 KB Cache
->Intel Original 845 GLAD Motherboard
->128 MB 266 MHz DDR SDRAM
->Samsung 5400 rpm 40 GB IDE HDD
->Samsung 32-10-40 CD-RW Drive
->LG 500V 15" Color Monitor
->Logitech PS/2 First Mouse+

I need the system to do the following :
->Programming, Programming & lots more Programming in C/C++, Java, PHP, Python, Perl & of course the almighty Bash shell
->Running an Apache Web Server with support for Databases and Server Side Scripts.
->Running Database Servers (MySQL & PostGreSQL)
->Running an X Server

Currently my system is in a stable condition (I normally shutdown/rebbot infrequenly only to play some games in Windoze but i have had uptimes of upto 7 days without any problems. On the whole no big prob upto now.) but is a bit slow (using KDE) because of 128 MB ram only. I think the undue requirements of more ram are unjustified by new OS. Is it really necessary to upgrade to at least 256MB for kernel 2.6.

3 cheers for OSS.

i gives me the pop up window for entering login and
passwd and then i get this erros message

This server could not verify that you are authorized
to access the document requested. Either you supplied
the wrong credentials (e.g., bad password), or your
browser doesn't understand how to supply the
credentials required.

Hello All.

I would like to know if any body on the list could help me out in undertaking my In Plant Training at Bangalore, Chennai, or New Delhi.

I am going to complete my B. Tech. VI Semester Exams on the 4th of May, 2004 & would be free for the months of Mya-June. I will mail my resume later and have not attached it here as it would waste valuable space and most probably it would get filtered of as an attachment.

Any help is deeply appreciated.

3 cheers for OSS.

get hold of the .config file of your current kernel. that
will tell you all about which features were built statically,
which features were built as modules, and which features
were not built.

the .config file can be found at the top level directory
of the source. i.e. where you have, among other files, the
README file.=20

that's that, given that your current kernel conf is stable.

A programming language is low level when its programs require attention

Why IP addresses are represented in 32-bit patterns? Why can't we have more bits?

Take a look at CD-Writing HOW-TO from tldp.org before your start.

You have to turn on SCSI emulation of your CDROM drive if you are using 
an older version of cdrecord which doesn't suport ATAPI writers. (Note 
that SCSI emulation is deprecated in Kernel 2.6). For enabling this your 
have to pass "hdc=ide-scsi" to your kernel (Assuming CD writer is /dev/hdc).

An example cdrecord command string to burn an iso image (on my system) is

# cdrecord -v dev=0,0,0 speed=52 driveropts=burnfree sarge-i386-1.iso

that is the address scheme in ipv4

look at ipv6 for "more bits"

www.ipv6.org.           1H IN CNAME     shake.stacken.kth.se.
shake.stacken.kth.se.   1H IN A         130.237.234.41

What is going wrong. Please shed some light on it. And forgot i am using 
redhat9 with the 2.4.20-8smp.

You can use my own project. Let me know if you are interested.

http://www.devforge.net/kibunch/

The thing is, it can be extensively customized.


I have orders from a few companies/colleges/polytechnics already. I'll
be too glad to customize it for you.

But this kind of data loss happend with reiserfs !  Well, I haven't 
tried with other distributions, but this kind of mess up happened in MDK 
9.1 reiserfs partitions atleast twice.

Some other systems are also running MDK9.1 but with ext3.  Nothing like 
that happened (so far).

I wanted to use reiserfs since I felt that would give better performance 
for our pattern of files/usage.

Can somebody who has a PC + CD writer contact me?  I have an old hard 
disk (with freebsd installed) where i have a lot of old files (mail, 
mp3s etc) that I want to write to a CD.

Two problems I have is that my CD writer has some problems, and my 
current PC is a tiny mini atx cabinet that's so crammed with stuff that 
just taking it apart to plug in this HDD as a slave is going to be 
painful :(

The bsd install on this hdd doesnt have a cd writer software installed 
though .. have to install something like cdrecord I guess.

The stability of a server depends on various factors. 

* Operating System running on that
* Latest Security updates
* A clueful Administrator

Essence: Whether it is RHL or  Fedora or Debian, stability of a server
depends on the person and the way he handles it.

Message-ID: <c5vvjs$5b4$1@sea.gmane.org>

I have shared some directories from my redhat 9 system thro' NFS.
Is there any way i can see which client is accessing file in the share.
Normally logs show only who is accessing which share. i need to know 
about the files currently accessed by the clients.

Thanx

Today I wrote a script to send all  users about their account Info.  There
were about 500 users.  But in the middle, error messages came
"Resource temporarily unavailable"

So the mail is reached only to small group of users.  I am wondering why
this happens.

The mail will be queued for another attempt, if you have injected all
these into local sendmail.

you are essentially calling 500 instances of /bin/mail?

anyway that calls the local sendmail.

do a "mailq" and see - the rest of the mail will be queued for later
delivery I guess.

  `mailq` doesn't returned anything usefull.  Seems like it has flushed
  the queue. But I didn't get the mail to my mailid for example.

  Now the problem is not there, as I removed sources from ISOs from

  Now the problem is not there, as I removed sources from ISOs from
  sources.list, though that is dirty hack, but it seems like a bug in apt.

Hi,
you might want to look at the apt-howto. Google for the apt-howto.

There is a tool called  netselect-apt.

I am attaching the information as text file. I did a copy and paste from
the debian website for using it at home. I havent tried it yet.

(See attached file: apt-howto.txt)

This  file is only a partial version and covers netselect which can help u
set up your sources.list

Regards,
Sanjay

Most Indian internet providers (dishnet/touchtel) are very well connected
to Singapore.  The NUS mirror is pretty quick on my touchtel line.

   Are you using the modem being now-provided by touchtel?  Seems like
   there are not linux-drivers for that ... how u are going about using
   it?

I am running

 $ apt-get dist-upgrade  (~250MB)

now.  I am running it through GNU screen (in case if the client get
crashed).  But what would happen if in the middle of setting up packages,
the server crashed.  What would happen to the state of debian?  Will it be

Did anyone find a suitable Internet connection provider?

I tried these

1. Hathway - http://www.hathway.com/bci/packages.htm
2. Touchtel - no support under linux (they won't provide/support old modems)
3. dishnet - NOINFO - dishnetdsl.com is not loading at all

Hathway is cable internet, so trusting that is in doubt. Any happy hathway
customer?Anybody have any info on dishnet?

I need internet connection that has no time limit (buy may be data limit).
 Can anyone suggest a good one?  ... and I feel difficult to pay more than
Rs. 1000/- per month.
Any thoughts?

touchtel and dishnet will both give you USB modems which do have third
party linux drivers - search at http://eciadsl.flashtux.org (that page
is in french, click the uk flag on the top right hand corner of the site
to get the english version)

Dishnet also has a (more expensive) "broadband router" option, which
does PPPoA (at least in dishnet's case) and gives you an ethernet port
that you can plug into your linux box.

Dishnet has a data limit of 1 gb per month.

IIRC, You can get 500 MB per month at 128 Kbps (no time limit) 
for that price (better to verify with them.)

My touchtel provided dsl modem terminates with ethernet and is setup to
work as a network bridge.  I have not tried the touchtel USB modems
under Linux (which I suspect will be a major pain, getting the my
earlier Dishnet USB modem to work was also a huge headache).

Btw, I heard rumour that Touchtel is planning on abandoning the USB
modems in favour of the ethernet ones.  Good news for linux-ers.

It's highly unlikely that your box will crash due to software problems.
But it still depends what you are upgrading to.  Upgrading between
stable releases (eg. potato -> woody) is *extremely* robust.  IIRC the
potato to woody update did not even require a reboot!

I've upgraded several boxes from woody to sarge without any major dramas
(expect XFree86 to fall over, but that's pretty much it).

Recovering from hardware problems, or a power failure depends on the
filesystem you are running and a number of other factors.

In any case, your upgrade session can be resumed with -
    apt-get dist-upgrade  # this will pickup where it left off
    apt-get -f install    # finish installing any pending debs

Note: Apt stores its downloads in /var/cache/apt/archive so you can
      easily save your downloaded files for future use.

Oh it would? I'm just saying my experience has been positive, other
people are free to decide for themselves and my opinion is not
based on their experience.

Anyway the complaints below don't make much sense, because the
question of how much you "actually" downloaded is meaningless.
The metering is done right in the modem, and it counts everything
that comes in, applying no intelligence. They told me that right
at the beginning. If you're fine with that, go for it. Otherwise
there's no deal. 

Anyway I spend hours online everyday, and I don't even exceed
300 MB. And calculations starting with "say you download 2.5
KB per second" are utter nonsense, because your sustained BW
is going to be far less than that (unless you're downloading
mp3s etc. If you want to do such things you're definitely going to
get screwed.) My usage pattern is mostly browsing and ssh (typing
this over ssh, BTW; almost unnoticeably low latency, which I 
never got over dialup) and it suits me just fine.

Tell you what, this person probably had a windows machine which
was infected with spyware/worms which were downloading god-knows-what.
That's how they'd have got 2GB.

FYI the guy is using linux, doing no more than downloading standard
updates and patches (which on slackware tend to be few and well thought
out) ...

Try downloading a lot of mail over imap, just for instance.  I download
close to 40..50 megs of work related email (all of it spam, given that
my job is spam filtering) every day :)

Message-ID: <20040419182858.D94237278@sitemail.everyone.net>

Hi,

I have an Intel 865GLC motherboard with onboard graphics. I first tried to run X in redhat9 and then in fedora core1, but in vain. Finally I tried installing mandrake 10 community and i didn't even get the graphical installation. but the installation was successful. it asked for the third disk, i dont have one, so skipped that. whenever the GUI is starting up it shows up as totally glarred or something weird. madrakesoft.com says it 10 supports 865GLC.
Some of you please help me have a look at linux. This is my new computer and I just upgraded my old computer to this one to work in linux faster and better. but now it is not all working. I need help.

Thanks in advance,
Mahesh.

Hi,

There are a few things that you have to check and
correct before making x work correctly.

1. go to your BIOS and check how much memory it has
allocated for VIDEO. if it is 1MB or lesser, then you
have no chance of making X work in a resolution
greater than 640x480(8 bit).so, change it to  8 MB. if
the 8 mb option is not available, upgrade your bios
from the motherboard manufacturer website.(since yours
is new, it must have that option).

2. Choose your graphic driver as VESA in xf86config
file or any other utility that you might use. The
other things must be same, just change the driver
feild alone to VESA.

now you have a very fat chance of making it work. IF
not mail me with full details at
shriram@hcl.teradyne.com and iwill try my best to help
you. ( i myself faced these problems a month ago).


shriram

ps : PCQLinux derived from red hat fedora core-1 works
like a magic on i845/865 motherboards so why dont you
try that!!!?.

My tariff is 995 per month, 128kbps, 350 MB free download (up and down).
(Well, it is a different matter altogether, that ever since I went Linux, I
haven't been able to hook my comp on to the net, and hence, this month, I am
going to pay Touchtel 995 bucks for free!)
:-(

        Touchtel charges minimum 2495/- per month, though. Plus service tax
for 1.25 Gb transfers at 512 kbps. You pay extra for more usage/transfers.

        My touchtel provided dsl modem terminates with ethernet and is setup
to
        work as a network bridge. I have not tried the touchtel USB modems
        under Linux (which I suspect will be a major pain, getting the my
        earlier Dishnet USB modem to work was also a huge headache).

        Btw, I heard rumour that Touchtel is planning on abandoning the USB
        modems in favour of the ethernet ones. Good news for linux-ers.

        - Raja

Touchtel's 995/- per month is for the USB connection (no known Linux drivers
for the Zyxel Prestige 630 USB modem they ram down your throat with). Min.
2495/- per month + ST for the ADSL Router which (when setup as a bridge)

My tariff is 995 per month, 128kbps, 350 MB free download (up and down).
(Well, it is a different matter altogether, that ever since I went Linux, I
haven't been able to hook my comp on to the net, and hence, this month, I am
going to pay Touchtel 995 bucks for free!)
:-(

My touchtel provided dsl modem terminates with ethernet and is setup to
work as a network bridge. I have not tried the touchtel USB modems
under Linux (which I suspect will be a major pain, getting the my
earlier Dishnet USB modem to work was also a huge headache).
 
Btw, I heard rumour that Touchtel is planning on abandoning the USB
modems in favour of the ethernet ones. Good news for linux-ers.

Try to download the driver (binary) from the nVidia Site. I did the
same for the nVidia VCard. But NOT sure abt the NW Drv. :)

Hi,
first of all, is your driver compatible with Kernel version 2.6.3. Check if
Nvidia has a driver for that kernel.

I too had the same problem with my nForce chipset on Linux 2.6. I don't 
think nVidia sources work for Linux 2.6. I saw them working for Linux 
2.4. Better we should look for a binary driver I suppose. Since I didn't 
need it I left it alone. If somebody know the solution, that would be 
helpful.

Subject: [Ilugc] hotplug multiple device support
Message-ID: <20040420091530.720.qmail@web8007.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I tried plugging in one usb smartcard reader and 
hotplug first loaded the kernel module and also called
the startup script without any hitches. I then plugged
in the second device (usb smartcard reader). since the
same driver supports multiple device instances, the
driver successfully enumerated and created a new entry
in /proc/devices. since the module is already loaded,
the corresponding script in hotplug is not getting
called. i have written the script to create an entry
in /dev directory for my reader. is there anyway to
achieve this without modifying the souce in the
hotplug.functions script?

thx in advance
Joe

These are ludicrous prices!! Hathway is perhaps better. Rs 1000 gets you
128kbps and 750 MB. Rs 1500 gets you 1 GB.. but then again this doesnt
include modem which is another 300 I think... But these prices are all
terrible - cant keep a sid box updated enough :)

The prices are for touchtel's "broadband router" option - where you get 
1:4, 1:2 or even 1:1 shared ports for a dsl.

Touchtel's usb modem options are far cheaper, and closer in line to 
Hathway's prices - btw, hathway doesn't say how many people share that 128 
kbps pipe, I notice ...

To be fair to Touchtel, the 995 I told you about, included 200 free
land-line calls. :-)

These are ludicrous prices!! Hathway is perhaps better. Rs 1000 gets you
128kbps and 750 MB. Rs 1500 gets you 1 GB.. but then again this doesnt
include modem which is another 300 I think... But these prices are all
terrible - cant keep a sid box updated enough :)

Dear Vasudevan,

Where do you live/work? I would like to airlift you to my place, and get
your help setting it up.
Have lost half-my-weight, without a net connection for the past 30 days.
For my kind of work, a 0.2 difference in the kernel is no big matter. :-(

I get 128kbps almost always - its not shared bandwidth - Cyberwave used

Hi!

I am looking for a good ISP. Right now with VSNL
dial-up, but, wanting to move to cable. Problem is
hathway doesn't provide services in Gopalapuram, only
Dishnet DSL.

DSL said they will provide a modem that does not have
an ethernet port. How lame is that? You can't even
connect that to a router. It has to be directly
connected to USB. of a windoze machine. Atleast if it
had ethernet port I can connect it directly to
Linux/Unix machine with rp-pppoe client. Heard that
Tata is going to take over Dishnet soon, after a
month. Not sure if they can bring any positive moves.

I am still looking for other options,

Shaks

http://eciadsl.flashtux.org has linux drivers for their usb modems.

if you pay them extra, you can get an adsl router that does pppoa.

Thanks!

DSL can be my last option. I am still looking at other
ISP options, but, I would definitely need a router.
Have quite a few machines that I would like to connect
to the Internet and router/NAT protection is very
important for me :)

Does anyone have any PCs that is sitting idle in their
homes? I don't need keyboard or mouse or monitor, but
if you want to dispose off them, I would be happy to
take them for free :)

I am also looking for web hosting services running
Linux/UNIX servers. Do you guyz recommend anyone? Even
a 30MB space for a good deal will be great!

The dsl router that dishnet gives you is a crappy aztech 906e - but it 
certainly does NAT, port forwarding etc, and can be telneted into if you 
want to configure it by hand.

Just pick up a simple 10/100 switch and connect the wan port of the 
switch to the ethernet port on your broadband router.

If you want, pick up a small $75 wireless AP from somewhere - especially 
if you have a laptop with wifi.

http://www.pair.com is good.  They are not the cheapest around, but 
still quite ok.

set up sendmail to relay for your lan ip address space.

in /etc/mail/access -

192.168.0 [press tab] RELAY

Then save the file and do this -

Then suddenly I realized that for all the goodwill that Google seems to have
garnered, it is not open, and hence, by default, suspect.

Searched (using Google, talk about irony!) for an open source search engine,
a community-developed effort where we know what we are searching AS WELL AS
how we are searching.

The only risk/disadvantage would be the computing power and the
storage-space needed to host this decidedly non-decentralizable behemoth.

Found this though:-

Ideas for an Open Search Engine Index

If you're interested in the idea of a community-built search engine, you may
want to wander over and investigate the offerings at Open Index (
http://www.openindex.org/ ). This site is not a specific project for
building an open search engine index, but more a gathering place for ideas
and pointers to various information.

At the moment this site offers discussion forums (not very active), an
overview of the Internet and indexes (how about sourcing some of these page
estimates?) thoughts about defining and designing an ideal index, and some
links. As I said, there isn't much here yet. But I hope this site stirs up
some interest in the search community and maybe some responses from its
leaders.

Hi,

I guess what you have in mind in running a script to
create inode-entries is to map the devices to user's
static view-point of the device namespace. If that's
the case, consider a mounted-pipe / STREAMS device
and a daemon combination to invoke your script
functionality. This would make your device-interface
non-generic, but cleaner and more effective than a
post-install script ( which will be called only on
module load ).

DevFS would do the job if you provide library based
API for implementing identity-mapping using your
proc data. Somewhat like the ALSA model for sound.

unless I am mistaken, I think you have to add an MX record in your DNS
server  which qualifies your mail server.

ex if 192.168.0.1 is the mail server, you have to add an MX record for the
same in your DNS machine and only then it should proceed.
I maybe wrong....srs would be able to help you better.

mx records are for receiving email from the internet.

they have no relation on who / who isnt authorized to send email through 
a particular mailserver

While 'open source search engine' has a nice ring to it, it isn't
very meaningful, any more than 'open source house' is.

Suppose google published what they claim to be their source code
and said its GPL'd. Now what? How do you know that its actually
what they're running? Duplicate their 100,000 machine server farm
and verify it? (yes, 100,000.) And if you're not happy with google
what do you do? How does the source code help you?

Wake me up when hardware gets cheap enough for hobbyists to buy
enough memory to store the whole web.

You say this is "decidedly non-decentralizable", yet the website
you've pointed to below says that it is concerned exclusively with
distributed efforts. I think it might be better to get some idea
of what we're talking about first.

This is an issue of trust, not sofware; a social, not a technical
concern. The only way out of your problem is for everyone to operate
their own search engine. Duh.

There is no reverse dns (PTR) entry for the ip 10.1.14.73

You (or rather whatever random script you used to configure sendmail) 
has gone and set sendmail up to refuse mail from IPs without reverse dns

   So what should I do? (edit /etc/mail/sendmail.mc? how?).

   Well, this is very urgent, as our deparment staff are having trouble

What did you do now, that you did different from the previous setup?

Yes, edit sendmail.mc by hand (dont waste time with debconf when you are 
configuring daemons). Then rebuild sendmail.cf.

Well Arvind,
I don't know why you are picking on me like this for an innocent post.
Anyway, now that you dragged me into it, some more "thoughts"...

>>>>>>>>>While 'open source search engine' has a nice ring to it, it isn't
>>>>>>>>>very meaningful, any more than 'open source house' is.

I don't know how you got the idea that I searched for an open source search
engine,
by typing in "open source search engine". :-(

>>>>>>>>>Suppose google published what they claim to be their source code
>>>>>>>>>and said its GPL'd. Now what? How do you know that its actually
>>>>>>>>>what they're running? Duplicate their 100,000 machine server farm

You are talking about correctness verifiability here, I guess. That has
always been
a tough nut. But, I am not talking about that. I am talking about those
strange things
that happen... Like what happened to George Bush, the word jew, etc, and
Page couldn't
explain why it was happening. (or didn't want to).

>>>>>>>>>and verify it? (yes, 100,000.) And if you're not happy with google
>>>>>>>>>what do you do? How does the source code help you?

Those 1 lac only store data. I am not talking about data. I am talking about
the softbrain
that sifts through it. I don't need to replicate their server farm, to do
that.

>>>>>>>>>Wake me up when hardware gets cheap enough for hobbyists to buy
>>>>>>>>>enough memory to store the whole web.

Yes, I agree with you. But, didn't you read that recent post where Bill
Gates went on record
saying Hardware will soon hit Zero Cost? And, by the way, that line is
self-negating.
You can't EVER have enough memory to store the whole web, because,
semantically analyzing
your sentence, the web is nothing but what is there in a million odd boxes
around the world.
And, so how can a box ever aspire to have everything including what it has
inside itself? :-)

>>>>>>>>>You say this is "decidedly non-decentralizable", yet the website

Yes, they only talk about it though. I said it was decidedly
non-decentralizable because,
like you say, it was hardware INTENSIVE, to make any sense. Software, being
the vapour
that it is, is so easily decentralized. Look at how Nasa is down to its
knees begging for
free-cpu-cycles from homepc guys for its seti search and protein folding?

>>>>>>>>>This is an issue of trust, not sofware; a social, not a technical

I beg to differ here. I don't think that is the only way out. (Correct me if
I am wrong).
I feel, once Google gets its game right, launches IPO, makes enough money
for three generations,
and sets up an exceptionally good file system and hardware-mirror-around the
world, it surely can
do a great good turn to the whole world (cyber/physical) by giving its
algorithm out! (Thereby
ensuring that no other search engine comes any nearer!!)

Don't you think so??

Rajendran.

Sridhar,  you  are running  Debian  unstable  on  your production  box
!!.  You could  have better  run stable  and then  install  the latest
version  of  sendmail from  source.  Running  apt-get update;  apt-get
upgrade can some times create problems in unstable release.

we listed all classes (1...255) in `Relay Domains` of webmin sendmail

Mr barani enable the following entry in httpd.conf,then it will work
1) <IfModule mod_perl.c>
  Alias /perl/ /var/www/perl/
  <Location /perl>
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Apache::Registry
    Options +ExecCGI
  </Location>
</IfModule>

2.another thing whatever your scripts copied into appropriate httpd home 
directory.
you will do above 2 tasks,it will work.

Hi Friends,
  
    I am Madhan from Chennai. I need to know info
about network and system in the following 

scenario.Because I have been given the responsibility
to design the network and implement it.

At present In my company we are having 15 systems and
1 server. All systems are running 

Windows 2000 Professional.We have ADSL account. Net
Connection is shared to the other 

systems through wingate proxy from the server. Other
than Net connection there is no work for 

server. We donot run a mailserver.

   Now management have decided to buy 40 systems. Some
20 systems would be specifically 

used for working in Business Objects under Windows
2000.So I that 20 systems I have to make 

19 clients and 1 Server. The Remaining 20 systems
should be operated as a separate LAN.

   So Now I have to make Existing 15 system grouped as
one LAN. THen 20 Business Objects 

systems as One LAN. THen other 20 Systems as one LAN.
There LANs should be connected. I 

need 1 mail server for all machines.

    Hope You understand. This is my plan. I have to
know wheather this would be correct. How 

Should I  design a mail server. Where should I run
Linux machines and Windows machines. How 

to configure all systems. 

   If anyone can help me then It would be great for
me. If anyone is in chennai, give me your 

contact no. so that I can meet you regarding this
issue. 

  Waiting for response.

                      Madhan

I wasn't picking on you, just criticizing the idea. Approximately 
1,350,200 people have had the same idea before, and as you found out,
none of them has as yet progressed to fruition.

But perhaps I was not very polite, in which case I apologize.

Oh, I was laboring under the impression that when someone searches for

all along. I'll be more careful in the future.

Excuse me, but I'm not quite sure you have any idea what you're talking
about. The existence of googlebombing is the greatest testament to the 
NON-EVILNESS of google, and is free speech at its finest. Far from nobody
being able to explain how it happened, it is extremely well known how
pagerank works. The fact that google won't deviate from their published
algorithm even under political or other pressure says a lot about their
integrity. I'm sorry, but I'd suggest you read about these things before
spinning conspiracy theories. http://www.webmasterworld.com/ is a good
place to start.

And as I said in my previous post, the softbrain or whatever is useless if
you aren't able to replicate the server farm.

Amazing logic. First, I didn't say a single box would have to store the 
entire web. Second, most of those zillions of webservers, which are 
hobbyist sites, have only a few megs of web content. Third, google already
has enough boxes to mirror the web, so I don't know what you're trying to 
prove.

Hi,

There are two kinds of cryptographic algorithms: single-key, or
symmetric algorithms and two-key or assymmetric algorithms. They
have different properties and are used for different purposes. 
There is no relation between the key sizes of the two.

Currently the standard for the former type is 128 bits, and for
the latter it is 1024 bits. I think that's the source of your
confusion.

I'm not familiar with the movie in question, but 128 bit symmetric
keys are currently *not* breakable (assuming, of course, that the
algorithm itself doesn't have weaknesses. But then any crypto 
algorithms shown in movies are unlikely to be more secure than rot13 ;-)

Hmm..if I remember, Page said that he didn't mind such Google bombs. 

Now, I have to go with Arvind here..how are we gonna gain out of knowing
Google's PageRank algorithm? This is not a Linux kernel which you can
download and play around with. Lets say you do get the code..how is
anybody going to understand it without Google's data? We can just make
educated guesses..but that's what it'll be at the end of the day -
guesses.

But Google, on the other hand, stands to lose a lot. People like MSN,
AltaVista who have access to the same type of data can easily profit
from Google opening up its algorithms..and no one would know about it.


On a slightly unrelated note, I have always wondered whether it would be
possible to build a P2P search engine..basically have millions of users
spidering and indexing all the time. I guess that sounds more like a
grid-computing initiative, but I'm sure you understand what I mean.

Those 1 lac only store data. I am not talking about data. I am talking
about the softbrain that sifts through it. I don't need to replicate
their server farm, to do that.

Yes, I agree with you. But, didn't you read that recent post where Bill
Gates went on record saying Hardware will soon hit Zero Cost? And, by
the way, that line is self-negating. You can't EVER have enough memory
to store the whole web, because, semantically analyzing your sentence,
the web is nothing but what is there in a million odd boxes around the
world. And, so how can a box ever aspire to have everything including
what it has inside itself? :-)

Yes, they only talk about it though. I said it was decidedly
non-decentralizable because, like you say, it was hardware INTENSIVE, to
make any sense. Software, being the vapour that it is, is so easily
decentralized. Look at how Nasa is down to its knees begging for
free-cpu-cycles from homepc guys for its seti search and protein
folding?

I beg to differ here. I don't think that is the only way out. (Correct
me if I am wrong). I feel, once Google gets its game right, launches
IPO, makes enough money for three generations, and sets up an
exceptionally good file system and hardware-mirror-around the world, it
surely can do a great good turn to the whole world (cyber/physical) by
giving its algorithm out! (Thereby ensuring that no other search engine
comes any nearer!!)

Don't you think so??

Subject: [Ilugc] Volunteers? New man page doc project
Message-ID: <20040424023613.40086.qmail@web40103.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi!

I am working on a man page documentation project (on
my own) and would like to know if anyone would be
interested in joining me. Basically man pages don't
provide sufficient examples for the different command
options and I am writing illustrative examples for
each option with as many examples as possible.

This is basically for system/network administration
commands, but, we can expand the idea to other
commands as well.

For example, download at.1 (man page for "at" command)
file from here:
http://www.rit.edu/~sak5991/at.1

To view the man page, do:
#nroff -man -Tascii at.1 | less

Let me know if anyone will be interested in rewriting
the man pages with examples,

Thanks,

Shaks

Given the  fact that  gmail wants  to read your  mails (or  atleast it
intended to read your mails at  some point of time before this privacy

measure. Infact  they would be spamming  me! (ok, its  not "spam". its

Thats exactly  my point.  Google certainly does  some cool technology.
Its not  logical to assume that  google is NON-EVIL  because its doing

They've done a lot of work on building a superior web e-mail interface. Their surprise at the tempest is not inappropriate. Many of the issues raised here are subtle and known only to full-time privacy lawyers. In addition, many of the debated features in GMail are already present to some degree in competing products like MSN Hotmail, Yahoo Mail and AOL. And indeed, some of the reaction has been silly and a bit paranoid, and some of that has gotten a lot of the attention.

> The thing many people reacted to the most was the idea of displaying ads keyed to words in your mail. We think of our mail as fairly private, and we do a lot of private stuff in e-mail. Google's ad-linking is all done by computer, they promise not to have human beings look at the mail (almost all the time). If only a computer "knows" your deepest secrets, is there a concern? I certainly let my own personal computer contain all sorts of private information, ranging from my finances to private e-mails with my family.
> 
> Even so, people have a reaction to a 3rd party computer doing scans like this. If you were offered a service that saved you money by having your paper mail opened by robots for scanning, which then inserted new junk mail in your box based on what it found, you might get a bit creeped out. Go further and consider a service that gave you free phone calls if it could have speech-recognizing computers listen in and barge in with product offers related to your conversation? It's easy to imagine an unpleasant situation where you get invited to a gay wedding in Vancouver, and find with it in your mailbox brochures for gifts, Vancouver hotels and a free copy of Out magazine. People have extended that fear into the e-mail realm.
> 
> Of course, webmail is an optional service. Those afraid of these sceneria can simply not use it, and that's an entirely reasonable answer. But it ignores an aspect of the privacy fears we have. In the modern era where computers threaten privacy, we are as afraid of outside computers knowing all about our lives as much as we are outside people. Even though we might trust the people running the computers today, or the human health insurance clerk who learns we have cancer, we are uncomfortable with both of those things. We are not quite as uncomfortable about the computer knowing, but it's hard to ignore the fear that, in spite of the best of intentions, information on external computers (and even our own computers) sometimes makes it out into the world.
> 
> People's fears here are sometimes irrational, but still real. And irrational fears often affect privacy and freedom, even when they are irrational. Consider the amusing Wall Street Journal story some time ago headlined, "Help, my Tivo thinks I'm gay!" (The Tivo suggests shows to you based on what you have watched before. Tivo says that this does not leave the box associated with your identity, though they do collect data on all Tivo use, stripping off the identity along the way.) People became annoyed at or scared by their video recorders.
> 
> Google is not ignorant of this issue, of course. They plan to work hard to not do something so bold as sexual ads on your salacious e-mails with your husband. They know that even irrational freaking-out generates a real consumer issue.
> 
> And it's not to be ignored that well-targetted advertising is itself a useful thing. If you take as a given that you're going to accept ads to subsidize an activity, few wish to have their time wasted by ads that are irrelevant. In addition, well-aimed advertising costs advertisers more because it is more effective -- which means you can get the ad subsidy you are seeking with fewer ads. Clearly many users find themselves buying products from these ads, products they might not have known about without them, so good ads can be a service unto themselves.

This isn't the first time this will happen, but for millions it will be the biggest such jump. Particularly if one's searches and social network can be correlated with this information. My e-mail contains the story of my life, and what's not in there is often recorded in my searches.

As usual, we don't plan to do so, and the people building it would oppose it being used that way. But they build it nonetheless. We make it so that having that surveillance becomes a "logical" step -- changing a law or a policy, or in some cases just pushing a button, rather than a physical step -- going into somebody's house to grab their papers.

Our networked computers at home are not very secure, of course -- probably less secure than Google's against unauthorized intruders. But they must be broken into a million times -- though possibly by one giant virus -- and those outside machines must be compromised (by the law or by system crackers) only once.

Installing, running and upgrading software on your home computer is hard. A remote computer is professional maintained, and almost surely a lot faster too. It can be reached from anywhere. In many cases, where you want to roam all around and access your data, or have servers receive data for you while your home computer is off, it's the only way to do things well. I won't pretend that such centralization is not quite useful, or imagine it is something we can stop from happening.

I wonder, for example, about what it means to the people of China that we have built our instant messaging infrastructure and some of our E-mail infrastructure entirely with centralized servers and no encryption? Their government can and does routinely listen to internet traffic. When we build our systems, how often do we think of what it will mean when they become popular in China, or Saudi Arabia? Or what it means when they are sold to other companies whose policies are not so benevolent.

(Of particular importance, you authorize them to scan your mail for these purposes, and that authorization is the act that risks stripping you of your rights.) All the other webmail companies who don't already do this will, I'm sure, quickly have offerings to compete with GMail. As noted, not only do they search it, but they scan on viewing to provide ads that match the content, making it not just a database but a shopping service. Should you click on those ads, the merchants will see your IP address, and know somebody from that address (or with their cookie) was reading a page, search result or e-mail related to their ads.

> Unfortunately, a database and shopping service doesn't look as much like an e-mail delivery service as it should according to the legal definitions in the ECPA. Thus, while Google promises not to peek into your e-mails or hand them to others, the danger is that this is now solely their contractual promise. With an e-mail delivery service covered by the ECPA, the law, not just Google's terms of service governs when your mail can be handed over.
> 
> Google also has some work to do on their privacy policy, because it does allow them to look at or release your e-mail in circumstances where they would be forbidden to do so if it were ECPA protected, such as a law enforcement "request." But even if it bound them as tightly as the law does, it still contains the ubiquitous clause letting them change the policy at will, without your consent -- so it's really not a strong restriction at all. The policy should state at a minimum that changes to it which would reduce the privacy of your mail can only take place with your explicit and informed consent at the time of the change.
> 
> A lot of privacy policies should say that, of course. They don't, because doing this in general is a logistic nightmare. However, with work, one can fine-tune such policies to dictate what can be changed and what can't, to do at least as well as what the law requires of e-mail delivery companies, if not better. This is not easy, it's hard. But it's worth doing.
> 
> When you use network services, you need a contract, and that contract will be written primarily to protect the interests of the service provider. When you run software on your PC, you may agree to terms when you install software, but as far as your own data is concerned there is usually no question of contract at all. The data is on your PC, and there don't have to be rules governing what others can do with it.
> 
> Without the ECPA protection, your e-mail (now just a database) can be seized against Google's will with an ordinary subpoena (vastly less involved than a wiretap warrant) or in the discovery phase of a lawsuit. With warrants, and in some rare cases even without them, your mail can be grabbed without you being informed that this has been done. Worse, Google has retained the right to hand it over in the case of a "request" from law enforcement, rather than a court order.
> 
> Of course, these legal techniques can be applied to the data you store yourself. However, short of a secret warrant to break into your house and seize your computer, it can't be done without your knowledge and involvement. You have the chance to fight any attempt to grab your mail. You have the power to get a lawyer and appeal any order in front of a judge. You give up some of that power when you put your e-mail database in somebody else's hands. Google is a good company that wants to please its users, they don't want to be subject to all these subpoenae. But they won't fight as hard as you would.
> 
> It's also important to note that most of these webmail providers are global companies, with servers around the world. The ECPA is a U.S. law, only protecting mail in the USA. Some other nations have protections but they certainly all don't. Unless care is taken, your mail could end up stored in another country without legal protections you were hoping for.
> 
> Now, after scaring you like this, let me add that this is an entirely new situation, and the courts have not yet ruled whether the ECPA covers your mail in a searching/advertising database service. It's possible they might, but from the text of the law, quite possible they would not. Past history suggests it is highly likely the Department of Justice will take the position that the protection is lost.

> In the hoped-for event that your webmail archives are protected by the ECPA as what it calls an ECS, they lose some of that protection after 180 days. This is not news, but a product like GMail, which encourages long-term archving of e-mail with the web mail provider brings the question to the forefront. After 180 days your e-mail archives can now be fetched without a warrant, through a special ECPA court order or a subpoena. (In most cases, but not all, you will get notice of such seizures.)
> Expectation of Privacy
> 
> In the USA, privacy from government intrusion is defended by the Fourth amendment, which requires a warrant be issued by a judge for many kinds of searches and seizures. Over the years, court precedents have required that warrant when you have a "reasonable expectation of privacy" over what's being searched. The definition of when and where you have this expectation of privacy has been in flux. Court decisions have sometimes sustained the expectation of privacy, but often eroded it.
> 
> The higest standard of privacy has been "the privacy of your own home." For example, the courts have ruled you to not have as much expectation of privacy in a car as you do in a home. Not as much on your open land as inside your house. Not as much in an RV as in a house. Your day-guests don't have the same privacy in your house as you do.
> 
> When technology changes privacy, there is always a battle over this expectation. The police want to reduce it so they can do more without warrants. The public wants to keep their privacy. Recently police made a number of arrests over the years by using infrared scanners to look for signals coming from inside a home. The court eventually told them no: That even though the IR was emitted from the house for view by "anybody" with the right equipment, what went on inside was still private. Often we lose privacy, as a man who lived in his motorhome discovered when the police were able to search it like a car because he was parked in a parking lot rather than an RV park.
> 
> Others have learned that what they say in front of baby monitors is not private, even though it is said inside their homes, because it is transmitted "in the clear" outside your home. (Cell phone calls, also often sent that way, have statutory protection of your privacy.)
> 
> E-mail privacy is in crisis because most e-mail is sent without encryption. That means that almost all e-mails are like postcards. Anybody with access to the wires (or airwaves) they travel over can read them. Because of this, arguments are being made that you should have no more expectation of privacy in an e-mail than you have in a postcard, or worse, a postcard you hand to a 3rd party to carry. This question will remain in the balance for some time.
> 
> GMail and its competitors may tip this balance, particularly if the e-mail managed by the webmail companies loses its ECPA protection status, the risk of which is described above. I send my e-mails from my own private machine, and that part is private. But I send them anywhere, including to webmail users where they are stored in a 3rd party database for searching. Of course, that database has password-controlled access and I would like to hope it's private, but there are those who will argue it's a step below the privacy expectation one has for one's own home computer. With a home computer, somebody has to break into your home or the computer to read the mail. On a 3rd party server, they can do that, but they might also see it due to a change of policy.
> 
> Sadly, we can also expect arguments that e-mails read from a database over an open wireless network might be akin to the cordless phone or baby monitor situation.
> 
> One can hope such arguments will not win. But what is true that the more e-mail that is sent unencrypted, the more it is stored in private but external databases, the greater the arguments will be that you no longer really can expect that your mail is secure and private from being seen by parties other than yourself and the recipients. If the courts ever become convinced this is true, e-mail could lose the protections it currently has, designed to parallel the protections of paper mail and phone calls.
> 
> My hope would be that Google's design should not reduce that expectation of privacy. But all e-mail vendors should work hard to ensure they don't even raise the risk, let alone pitch us over the edge. What a terrible thing if we were to lose the cherished expecatation of privacy we want in our letters in the name of convenience. The ECPA is just an ordinary law protecting e-mail privacy, not as strong as a constitutional protection.
> 
> The expectation of privacy issue is important because it has a bearing not just on users of GMail but on those who send mail to a GMail user. Since many people will alias other addresses into GMail, you may not be aware you are mailing GMail.
> Search correlation
> 
> You've probably noticed that a lot of your web searches contain private information. I often type into Google things like the names of prescription drugs I have been given, to find out more about them. I use search engines to research the stocks I buy and look up my friends, or see what people are saying about my family. Very private stuff.
> 
> Largely we treat our searching as anonymous, though in fact it's not nearly so anonymous as we might like. All the major search engines use a cookie that allows the to correlate together all the searches we do. If like me, you have broadband, your computer's numeric internet address is also fixed -- either permanently like mine, or effectively permanently as it is for all those who don't turn their computer off or who have a network gateway box.
> 
> All of the companies providing e-mail and search together create a troubling risk that the private matters in our e-mail can be combined with the things we search for. It's no surprise that this potential is there. Search companies are all eager to find ways to improve the relevancy of their search results in order to please their users. It's what we want them to do. Learning things about you is one obvious technique to do that.
> 
> Again this is part of a trend toward creating a giant dossier of all your private information in a central place. Because users will demand more accurate search, this trend won't be stopped. However, companies can be encouraged to anonymize data they collect, making it hard or impossible to link back to the real person
> 
> Google has said they are not correlating search and e-mail (or their social network prototype called Orkut.) That's good, but for business and user interface reasons they are not likely to say this will always be true. The browser cookie system allows the e-mail and search systems to share information about your identity unless you go to extreme lengths to delete your cookies or use cookie-washing software. Even then, unless you are a dial-up user, your IP address is almost as good as the cookie, perhaps better. Of course, once you have a common login for e-mail and enhanced search services your activities will be fully linked, as they can be on Yahoo today. You can only wash this through the extreme step of using a web anonymizer which bounces your requests among cooperating servers that hide your address.
> Global Search
> 
> The war on terrorism has rewritten the rules on what's possible in civil rights. Consider the idea that the government might come with a warrant or new law to an e-mail provider and say, "Search all your customer's e-mail to see if anybody was talking about planes and the World Trade Center before 8am on Sept 11."
> 
> Under traditional 4th amendment rules, such a broad fishing expedition would be unthinkable. But some people are finding it more thinkable. Some might even think it's a good idea, and proclaim they don't mind if this were done to their own mail.
> 
> Without large webmail archives, the idea wasn't even possible. Now it could be.
> What can Google Do
> 
> Google is proud of its reputation as a good corporate citizen that tries to keep its users interests at heart. It has done this even against the wishes of its customers (the advertisers) by putting restrictions on ads that other sites wouldn't place. This has actually been a good business decision, but Google espouses a philosophy of not doing any "evil" while building their business. It's a good philosophy.
> Encryption
> 
> The most obvious step Google could take would be to encrypt a user's e-mail, searching index and other associated data, so it can only be accessed using the user's password, and of course that password should not be stored when an e-mail session is over.
> 
> If need be, the mail can be held temporarily unencrypted before delivery to the user (because then it has ECPA protection) and thus indexed and tied to ads. Then it can be encrypted. Both the index and the mail contents must be encrypted so that they can't be read without your password. Police could get a wiretap warrant to watch you type in your password, so this is not as private as doing fully encrypted mail to your home PC, but as noted the warrant process defends your rights much more than the subpoena or contractual system does.
> 
> An overseas escrow system would allow recovery of your password if you lose it, and in the inevitable event of your death.
> 
> GMail could also encourage the use of encryption in sending mail, both by doing SMTP-over-TLS (a standard technique for encrypting mail as it moves from server to server) wherever possible for your incoming and outgoing mail, and also supporting standard e-mail encryption formats like S/MIME and PGP, as well as new opportunistic encryption systems. This would be a giant step forward.
> Resist correlation with search
> 
> This should be resisted as long as possible. If business needs -- which means pleasing the customer -- demand it, ways should be developed so that it's hard to tie the correlated data back to a particular user. If need be, it might even be better to have an explicit login (with password) so that the correlation data is also encrypted and only available when the user is logged on. Though frankly, I use Google search hundreds of times a day -- I'm always logged on.
> 
> Think about whether you can make such correlation opt-in, requiring the user's agreement. You might be able to create more accurate search doing this, but if customers want that, is it too hard to add the step of getting them to knowingly agree to it?
> Lobby to strengthen the ECPA
> 
> Google, Microsoft, AOL, Yahoo and others should join with us in pointing out that the ECPA is now outdated, and not providing enough legal protection for all the new technological innovations in e-mail delivery. Fight in court cases where the DoJ and others try to expand their powers to grab user e-mail.
> 
> All these companies could also push for similar and stronger protections in the other nations where they do business.
> Continue to refine policies and educate the public
> 
> Much of what Google is doing with GMail is innovative and worthwhile. It would be ridiculous to see it banned, as Senator Figueroa would suggest. It's not a lot different in kind from all the other well established webmail services -- but this doesn't mean those services didn't also have issues. There is not at this time, for example, a reason to be afraid of GMail and not afraid of premium Yahoo mail. Within months, the competitors will also release products with large archives and other features to keep up with Google.
> 
> So Google needs to refine their policies and contracts. Any policy that can be changed to protect user privacy that does no business harm to the company's plans should be changed. Even ones which do impede possible business plans should be evaluated and some of them done.
> What users can do
> 
> The hard truth is if you are concerned about your privacy, 3rd-party hosted web based e-mail may not be right for you. There are tools that will let you search the e-mail on your PC.
> 
> You can also be more careful about how cookies are used to track you on the web. Most browsers can help you control this. I recommend the absolutely free Mozilla browser which lets you easily turn on and off what cookies go to what sites. Google is a good site that lets you use it without cookies; not all sites are so kind.
> 
> The problem with privacy is that nobody cares about their privacy until after it's been violated. Only when Bill Gates discovered that his e-mail could be searched for a message about cutting off "Netscape's Air Supply" did he realize the danger in logging it. Many people only realize the danger in their records when they enter a lawsuit, or a custody battle. They all thought it would never happen to them.
> 
> If you are concerned there are a variety of resources, including tools for anonymous web surfing, fancy cookie-management and more.
> 
> Most importantly, tell companies that you care about your privacy. Because others, not yet finding it violated, are not giving this message even though they do care if they think about it.
> On the appearance of surveillance
> 
> To close, let me add one other rule about privacy. It is not only important to have your privacy. It is important that you believe you have your privacy. If you even suspect that you are being watched, it changes your behaviour and you become less free as an individual.
> 
> Are you the same person at your mother's house for holiday dinner as you were your first year on your own at university? How much you think you are being watched affects your freedom. How much a society thinks it is being watched affects the freedom of the society.
> 
> The fear that computerized scanning of our e-mails (to display ads or filter out spam) will result in actual harm is largely baseless. But even irrational fears affect our freedom, and this should be considered in software design.

	Patents and copyrights are totally different, and the way to help
	people understand them is never to mix them up or lump them
	together.... Software patents bring nothing to our community except
	danger. I am glad that Red Hat is getting some patents to use to
	defend against Microsoft's patents.  (I hope Red Hat never turns
	around to use them for aggression.) But the only help these patents
	give us is to block part of the danger of patents -- and only part
	of it! They have no positive effect. Taken all together, the patents
	do not play any role in the vitality of our community. Most patents
	threaten us, and a few may partly defend us from the threat of the
	rest.  We would be much better off if nobody had any software
	patents.

	India has wisely refused to allow software patents.  Every supporter
	of free software in India should be helping to support that policy. 
	Would you please help?  Please don't invite people to lump together
	a hypothetical future Indian law (software patents) that can kill
	our community and an existing Indian law (copyright) that has no
	such power.  -- Richard M Stallman <rms at gnu.org>

KDE, KPPP AND INTERNET DIALERS: Guntupalli Karunakar <karunakar at
freedomink.org> is working on the KDE live CD, and is planning to have kppp
("the cool KDE Internet dialer") to include some prominent ISPs across India
configured for it -- e.g. VSNL, BSNL (Sancharnet), Satyam, etc. Says he: "I
need their dialup numbers and any other setting that are used for them.
Ideally you one could just send me /home/user/.kde/share/config/kppprc (of
course with the username / password removed ). We will have an internet
dialup icon on desktop or panel, clicking which will make the kppp dialog to
come up. All the user would then need to do is select his ISP number and
give the username and password, and dial. At present it would work with
external modems only." Please do help, if you can!

THREE CHEERS TO KERALA: This input is from linux_schools at yahoo.com
(Herald), who writes: Kerala is leading in Free/Libre and Open Source
Software front. 200 schools multiplied by 100 students on an average gives
20 thousand GNU/Linux users. Children are very curious and fast in
experimenting and learning new things. When they go home and talk about it,
the elders also will be automatically interested in checking what this
software is. Similarly the Engineering students will start getting interest
in Free Softwares.... In Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh there are only the
private schools to harvest as the government ones have been captured by
Microsoft. Check  http://in.groups.yahoo.com/group/linux_schools/

MAHESH T PAI added earlier: About  200  schools in  Malappuram  district
installed GNU/Linux. The driving force behind this initiative, AFAIK, is one

SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVING GNU/LINUX: Shrave <shrave1 at yahoo.com> who does
much to keep active the mailing list
http://in.groups.yahoo.com/group/blore-linux/ comments:

The following I feel are the top three areas that need to be addressed for
moving Linux into the massive consumer and small office markets.

	1) I would suggest students to try and target one critically
	important piece of the Linux desktop puzzle: USB synching of
	OpenOffice documents and a cross platform PIM such as Chandler. This
	would allow Linux notebooks and tablets to be deployed en masse in
	most Windows based offices. Market share would then likely be built
	very rapidly as the case with Palm Pilots and their USB connected
	strategy. With market share, follows developer support, and a
	relatively quick destruction of the Microsoft desktop monopoly.

	2) Adding a GOCR module to OpenOffice should be another high
	priority goal.  GOCR is the open source optical character
	recognition project (OCR). For those that are not familiar (with the
	concept), OCR is used to convert paper based documents into editable
	word processor documents using a scanner.  GOCR is currently command
	line-based, but works very well. Developing this into a GUI version
	that could become an optional add on module for OpenOffice would be
	very useful for small offices and home offices considering a Linux
	desktop. Unlike developers, most end users live in a sea of
	paper-based documents and adding a bridge to access these documents
	digitally allows businesses to go to Linux desktops much more
	confidently.

	3) Adding a photo-editing module to OpenOffice similar to Apple's
	iPhoto.  This would tend to really help in promoting uptake of
	OpenOffice and Linux desktops in consumer market.  Digital cameras
	are now outselling film cameras and this is going to get even more
	important in the next few years.

QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ASSAMESE LANGUAGE: Jyotirmoy Saikia <jyotirmoy_saikia at
yahoo.com> of Picopeta, the Simputer guys in Bangalore, asks an interesting
query:

Can I type Assamese from Yudit using Inscript? Assamese and Bengali scripts
are same except two consonants: (i) Consonat RA (this is character U09F0 in
Assamese and character U09B0 in Bengali) (ii) Consonant VA (this is chracter
U09F1 in Assamese, which is equivalent of Devanagari character U0935). As
far as I know, there is no consonat VA in Bengali.

I have looked at the Open Type Akaash bengali font and found that the
characters U09FO and U09F1 are present in the font. But using the Inscript
keyboard layout for Bengali, I can't type these characters. I believe we
need a seperate Inscript keyboard map for Assamese. What is the suggestion
from other people in the group? Similarly, we'll need a Assamese keyboard
map for the Milan release also; am I wrong?

OFFICIAL SUPPORT FOR LOCALISATION WORK? Jitendra Shah <jitendras at
vsnl.com> reports that it is now "certain" that he will be working from
C-DAC Mumbai (formerly NCST) on a Central Government Localisation project
with the objective of localising Free/Opensource (GNU/Linux) in indian
languages with three angles: development of localised software (OS and some
applications for SOHEdu), deployment, and building a community of developers
and users.

Says he: "I think the objective is broad enough." Sometime back, Shah
started the work with a volunteer team. "It is heartening to see that there
are souls in the government who can identify and support such noble causes
too. While I believe such work will have to be done by dedicated people
without a pre-condtion of government support, there can be no doubt that
progress can leapfrog when there is official backing, particularly when such
support includes support for community participation rather than excluding
it."

Shah has a team of "good people who may want to contribute". But he's also
looking out for others who could get involved and help. He adds: "Since the
work is at all three levels -- system level, application level and (only to
some extent) content level, many people can contribute." Shah and team have
also been working on the conversion of legacy documents to Unicode. 

He adds: "I am trying to convert the silos of legacy data from
ISFOC/Akruti/ShreeLipi/whathaveyou to unicode. This has been welcomed by the
(Maharashtra) State government as well as Central government and corporates.
I propose to use the programs to help generate sustainance for the
developers through services rendered and eventually all programs will be
free/open source. I have now converted the Rajya Sabha webpage into Hindi
and also IITBombay pages."

Given the  fact that  gmail wants  to read your  mails (or  atleast it
intended to read your mails at  some point of time before this privacy

measure. Infact  they would be spamming  me! (ok, its  not "spam". its
"ADs". Whatever,  I wouldn't  be comfortable with  an AD  on body-part

Actually, I'm going to say...why won't you be comfortable? Now, think
about it for a second. No other human being will ever read about

would like to remind you that Google actually does guarantee that no one
reads your mail. So if some human does read your mail, they would be
breaking the law.

Fine..if you think its evil, don't use it. They're giving you a LOT of
features that no current web mail provider can even hope to match. If I
were Google, I would be looking at what I can get in return. There is no
such thing as a free lunch...

As for the ads, I would like to say 2 things

1. Going by Google's track record with Google Ads, I'm willing to bet
that these ads are really,really targeted. Say that you get a mail from
your friend about the Matrix Online...and lets say you see an ad for
cheap Neo/Matrix sunglasses/t-shirts at a shop near you. I definitely
won't mind such ads...and even more since the screenshots do show that
the ads are REALLY unobtrusive.


2. All the beta-testers who have blogged about it say that the ads
appear only for a few emails and they're really not annoying. Google is
not dumb...I'm sure that they'll be careful not to piss users off...as
they always have been. Google has an amazing track record of keeping the
users interests in mind...no reason to doubt them now.

As for me, I would definitely sign-up for a Gmail account. So what if I
get ads related to the mail I read? I'm getting an unbelievable set of
features for free.

Sriram

Hi!

Thanks for the reply. Basically the man pages have
already been written in the default file format. We
only have to add as many examples as possible to
illustrate the usage of the command.

1/ 
First, you have to read on how to write a man page and
become familiar with the tags. Check these links:
http://www.justlinux.com/nhf/Miscellaneous/Creating_Your_Man_Page.html
http://www.schweikhardt.net/man_page_howto.html
http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-mini/Man-Page.html
http://gmanedit.sourceforge.net/man7.html

The man pages are already present in /usr/share/man,
and in the directories within. To find out where the
documentation page for say "less" is, just do,
#whereis less
For example, in my system it is in
/usr/share/man/man1/less.1.gz. You can use online man
pages, but, it will be a pain converting them to the
standard man page format. So, let's just use the
existing man pages and add the examples.

2/
Extract the .gz file using:
#gunzip less.1.gz

3/
You can then edit the file (using any editor, vim or
emacs or any other) with examples for each option and
wherever necessary. You can use online documentation
or examples from books to provide the necessary
examples.

4/
Check the newly modified man page using:
#nroff -man -Tascii less.1 | less

We will then make a schedule and work on the commands.
We can move the discussion to private email from now
on. This will be a continous work-in-progress. We can
each do like 3 commands/week depending on work and
time.

Cheers,

Shaks

Hello,
         I want to learn Linux, Apache, Mysql, Php.
Where can I find good tutorials. Google did not
yield the desired results.
Any book for the beginners ?
I hear there is PHP forum in Chennai. Do they have
any mailing list or email ?

Thanks

Hi Varun,
   Slow. One by one. Linux means user level? Shell, generic working on 
Linux?
  Unix programming environment by Kernighan and Pike Prentice Hall India 
book

 If you are through, some amount of networking and protocols, http in 
particular.

 Apache is next extenstion after this.

 Why is database, how to work etc first question and then mysql or
  any other database.

 Yes google is great to find some problem - solutions but not replaces
 traditional book reading.

 My grain of salt is first purchase some books read and work. If you get
 any problems, search google. If you do search google for your material,
 humm it may not be good idea.

The point is  not about some human reading  my mails. Obviously nobody
would  (unless  there is  a  psychopath  of  an employee  who  derives
pleasure by  reading others'  mails).  I work  for Yahoo!  and  let me
explain (trying to not touch as much  wood as I'm not supposed to :) )
what it means to be using such a service. 

When you are on Yahoo! search,  only your unique browser (a cookie) is
related  to  the  keywords  you  search  for. Your  login  ID  is  NOT
associated with  the search queries  you make. so, clear  your browser
cookies and poof!  you become a new individual (practical uses: if you
are looking for jobs from your home, you wont get ADs at office :) ). 

Now, what gmail  proposes to do is to process my  mails, figure out my
"personality" and keep  targetting ads based on the  keywords found in
my mails. so  if I'm applying for jobs through GMail,  I'm sure to get
job  ADs at office  (and if  my manager  / employer  is smart,  he can
figure out that I'm finding a job!).

(I  guess,   more  serious  "family"  situations  can   arise  out  of
GMail... I'm thankfully unmarried :> ).

  Info pages are not well suited for quick references, but they come handy
when reading them as tutorial.  Shaks' idea is a welcome one, but
cluttering up a man page shouldn't be fruitful.  May be examples can be
added at the end of the manpage.

  Still getting the same problem!  BTW, I did it both in XServer(RH) and
client (Debian).  Do I need restart X in RH?

I think  by default, RH has  tcp listening enabled. However  if it was

Yes..he probably can. But think for a moment as to how me might be able
to find out. He might have
 (a) done some funky packet sniffing
 (b) Looked at your browser cache
 (c) Looked over your shoulder

Now, if you are applying for a job in Hotmail (since you say you work in
Yahoo :-) ), any one of those methods can get you caught with your
existing mail account.Say you open up an offer letter from Bill Gates in
your Yahoo account in your office...any one of those 3 techniques will
get you caught.

Now, Google only shows you ads related to a few emails..and that too
only when you open them. So as long as you don't open your job-related
mails in office...you're pretty safe..or as safe as you can be with any
current day service. Gmail doesn't try to "figure out your personality"
as you say..it only tries to show some ad relevant to the current mail
you have oepn.


As for the question of your search terms being associated with your
mail, Google has said that it only associates your email with you. So
even if you search for ...err..Britney Spears pictures at home, there's
no way Google is gonna know about it when you're at work...because
Google (the search engine) is separate from the Google searching through
your email.

As for ads, I really don't mind the targeted ads. For example, I see
tons of ads in Yahoo and Hotmail...and so far 0% of them have been
useful. I mean...MSN Groups shows me lingerie ads whenever I log
on!!(Yahoo isnt better...it keeps showing me ads for Yahoo
personals...now how did those guys figure out that I don't have a social
life? :-) ) So if Google can actually do something useful with all that
screen real-estate...and do it in a tasteful manner as they've been
known to do in the past, then why not.

Do remember that we're talking about Google's engineers here..not
exactly the dumbest people on the block. I'm sure these guys are
thinking of these problems as we speak (say you get spam related
to...err..Britney Spears pictures..you shouldn't start seeing ads on
Britney). So far, all the people I've spoken to say that not only are
the ads really, really unobtrusive (something you can see in the
screenshots)...but they only appear for a few mails.


I haven't personally tried out www.spymac.com but I'm pretty sure they
must have some sort of ad-based service. Instead of watching irrelevant
ads, why not watch ads that might actually interest me?

Sriram

Hi!

Once we finish a handful set of man pages, we will
give you the link and you can check them out and give
your valuable comments on how we can improve it.

We'll try to make it as legible as possible.

Adding examples at the end of the manpage doesn't help
because one has to keep scrolling back and forth. This
becomes difficult when you have a man page of 1000
lines.

Isn't that one of the reasons we have info pages?

I think you should be considering DocBook XML for documentation - you
can choose man, info, HTML, rich text format or plain text output after
preparing the documentation proper and marking them up (or mark-upping
them?)

Message-ID: <16525.25582.411351.668715@monster.linux.in>

Greetings,

Every day I receive several bounces from subscribers of ilugc whose
mailboxes have become full or have some problem or another.  I
currently have a ruthless policy.  I wait for a while and if I receive
more than 25 bounces from a particular subscriber, I unsubscribe the
offending address.  So if you find yourself suddenly receiving no
email from ilugc, it was probably me.

I could set the user on vacation (via the no_mail option) but that
leads nowhere since I have no way of knowing later that the subsciber
has lost interest in ilugc.

Also note that this is the only reason for a subscriber to be bumped
off the list.  Thus far no one has been (and hopefully will ever be)
unsubscribed out of a difference of opinion (or "bad" behavior).  So,
if you do find yourself at the receiving end of this treatment, please
remember this and feel free to re-subscribe when your mailbox
stabilizes.

While I'm at it, I'd like to bring to your notice that some of the
threads on ilugc are quite off-topic.  Please remember, this is ILUGC
which stands for Indian Linux Users Group - Chennai and not
I-Love-Using-Google-and-my-Computer.  Atleast have the decency to mark
these threads OT so people with real work can safely delete them. ;->

"Isn't that one of the reasons we have info pages?"

info pages don't give you examples, only an
explanation for the options. We are more concerned
here about giving illustrative examples.

"I think you should be considering DocBook XML for

You can configure mailman to do VERP (variable return paths) so that 
this unsubscribing is automated for you.

It will save you the headache of parsing through a lot of bounces.

We are still using Mailman2.0.  I know, 2.1 is a lot better but I
haven't had the time to do much about the upgrade and would rather not
do it now.  VERP apparently also has the problem of increasing the
load on the server.

I have a procmail recipe and a script which avoids much of the

Thanks.

No!  If you tune your fs not to run out of inodes you should be ok.

Mail delivery is speeded up so that you really dont have too much load.

My frodo machine is a celeron 2 ghz box with 512 mb ram .. and runs 
lists for ilug-delhi and some other people.  Load hardly goes beyond 1 
or so even with about 500 exim processes being forked.

I think what he asked was about loop back interface (network) and not 
loop devices if I am correct.

Anyways, if it is about loop devices, you can increase the number of 
loop devices by passing 'max_loop=n' where n=desired number of loop 
devices (I have 64 at present) to the kernel command line in case you 
are running a kernel >= 2.4 and you have loop device support compiled 
into the kernel. If you are running a kernel <= 2.2, you need to 
recompile the kernel changing the loop.c file in the kernel sources. 
Also you need to create the devices needed in the /dev directory with 
correct major and minor numbers and apropriate permissions. I created 
/dev/loop8 to /dev/loop63

You should make the XServer accept connections from the client. First
portscan yourself and check whether X-Server has openened a
port. It'll be usually 6000. Then., use 'xhost' to allow the client's
incoming connection.

Network loopback interfaces are similar to normal network interfaces. 
You can have multiple loopback interfaces and call them with :n prefix. 
For instance, if I need 6 loopback interfaces, I will configure lo, 
lo:0, lo:1, lo:2, lo:3, lo:4 with different IP adresseses such as 
127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3, 127.0.0.4, 127.0.0.5, 127.0.0.6

For achieving this in Debian, you need to edit /etc/network/interfaces 
and add lo:0 to lo:5 to the 'auto' line and add seperate sections for 
each loopback interface.

HTH.

hi,
well i had similar problems even after giving chmod as 777 for the sub....
then tried giving minimum settings
The minimum permissions of your public_html directory should be as follows: 
chmod 701 $HOME
chmod 701 $HOME/public_html
chmod 604 $HOME/public_html/index.html 

good luck 

cheers

   There is a debian linux server with X and some X programs (like xchat)
installed.  I am working from node (running RH7.3) connecting with that
server.  Since IRC, FTP, etc can be used only from the debian server I
wanted to run xchat in debian, but the display should be on RH7.3.

   The problem is nothing is happening when typed this

 $ DISPLAY="ipaddressofRH:0.0" xchat

  (No bash prompt back!)

  Where does X logs everything?

Sridhar-

Check the server log (usually under /var/log/XFree86.0.log) on the
server you're trying to connect to.

Most likely you might need to give permissions for the client that tries
to connect using `xauth' from the server.

shell# xauth add client.host:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
<cookie number>
shell# xauth list
client.host:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 <cookie number>

Meantime, in the slums below Ronnie's Ranch, Cynthia feels as if some
one
has made voodoo boxen of her and her favorite backplanes. On this fine
moonlit night, some horrible persona has been jabbing away at, dragging
magnets over, and surging these voodoo boxen.  Fortunately, they seem to
have gotten a bit bored and fallen asleep, for it looks like Cynthia may
get to go home.  However, she has made note to quickly put together a
totem
of sweaty, sordid static straps, random bits of wire, flecks of once
meaniful
oxide, bus grant cards, gummy worms, and some bits of old pdp backplane
to
hang above the machine room.  This totem must be blessed by the old and
wise
venerable god of unibus at once, before the idolatization of vme, q and
pc
bus drive him to bitter revenge.  Alas, if this fails, and the voodoo
boxen
aren't destroyed,  there may be more than worms in the apple. Next, the
arrival of voodoo optico transmitigational magneto killer paramecium,
capable
of teleporting from cable to cable, screen to screen, ear to ear and
hoof
to mouth...

  Well, seems like VNC itself is not working for me.  In display 1
(ctrl+f8) though active, no xterm is being displayed.  But `ps` shows
Xvnc running!!

  I am still looking at some way to get X apps running in (displayless)
server.

  Oops, I forgot to invoke the viewer. Now VNC desktop window is being
displayed, with xterm in it.

  The server was started like this
  # /usr/lib/X11/bin/vncserver :1

  And from the debian server (Xclient), I did this

  $ DISPLAY="<rhip>:1" xchat

   ... still getting the same problem ....!!

  Fine I have already tried that as I said in my previous mail.  xterm is
displayed in a new virutual X window.  But how to connect the Xclient
program (xchat) from the server (debain) to this virtual X server.

  debian$ DISPLAY="<rhip>:1" xchat

  is not working anyways!

   I tried that.  But vncserver fails regarding some font error (from X). 
But why should vncserver start the local X server.  What it is supposed
to do?   Coudn't I use vncviewer to connect with the running vncserver
from some other machine?

You should be logged in as root when using `xhost +', merely doing a `su
-' doesn't work (atleast for me)!

Don't give `xhost +' simply as somebody said on the list, unless you're
trying to say everyone can connect to my X server!

shell# xhost +a.b.c.d

should do the trick where a.b.c.d is the ip address of the client.

This URL might be of help to you:

Well, the Mailman FAQ said that it might be a problem, which is why I
thought it might be an issue.  Anyway, thanks for the information.

I dont think this is necessary., my woody box didnt complain.

Sridar: I use Emacs every day like this., i.e it runs on a remote
machine by the X display on the local terminal. I dont have a
problem. 

1. First make sure., the XFree86 on the local client (RH) is indeed
   listening for incoming network connections..

   $ nmap localhost 
   
   should help you with that.

2. Then., run $xhost +a.b.c.d where a.b.c.d is the ip address of your
   debian box.

3. Login to your debian box for the RH box using ssh or telnet. Then
   set the variable $DISPLAY =e.f.g.h:0.0 where e.f.g.h is the address of
   your RH box. After that., anything else you run should open the X
   window on your RH console.

Cheers,
Joe

At least, their govt has taken a quick decision on that,
unlike our politicians who have kept circumventing such
issues for quite some time now. Our President stresses on
OSS and Free Software but our politicians are behind
Bill Gate$. Its high time we take some such decision soon,
like China and Pak have done.

hi,

today read this article in The Hindu, about a linux=20
cluster which was deployed at The Institute of=20
Mathematical Science, Chennai. (www.imsc.res.in)
It is running RH8.0 and will be competiting for gaining
a place in the world's top 500 computer list=20
(http://www.top500.org/) this year.

Interestingly, as the report says, the cluster was ready
just two days earlier than the last date for any=20
supercomp to be eligible for this year's top500 chart.

great going!

Hi,
had a couple of friends from Pakistan, during my. M.S from U.S.  They liked
hindi movies and wanted the conflict to end and were against terrorism.
One cannot generalise like that.  Most of the nonsense is due to  politics
and fundamentalism.

lets leave politics out of this as srs said and just remember that there
are people like us everywhere. It might be just that
their views might not be so visible on the outside and unfortunately the
media pays more attention to the scandalous and spectacular.

In the same way, that the fundamentalist organizations from India got media
coverage for the wrong reasons, in International media.

Every place has different kind of people.
Lets leave it with that, I dont want to start a flame war.

Regards,
Sanjay

Hi all,
We are planning to deploy a VPN at our office.
If anyone has already worked on this before, please suggest me the VPN
softwares to be used.
I could find openvpn as a good OSS. Any other packages that you recommend?
Its a very simple setup that we need to go in for.
 
Thanx

Hi,
I am not getting you clearly. Are you looking for something like an
e-learning course where the course  can be taken online and quizzes created
and students can take the questions?

Hi,

I saw something on freshmeat the other day:
http://freshmeat.net/projects/quizshock/

"QuizShock is a Web-based quiz management system which uses PHP, MySQL, and Flash."

Yes, flash. Also note that it's proprietary.

I have written something vaguely like what you're asking for
which might be of interest to you. Gretools 
(http://theory.cs.iitm.ernet.in/~arvindn/gretools/)
is a vocabulary quiz program and it has a web-based
version at http://gretools.sourceforge.net/20questions/
Just a barebones thing, don't expect any features.

Hi,
    The Course may be Online / Offline ,  It can be
independent, but the Quiz / Test need to be conducted
online where students can answer multiple choice
questions.
  
Thanks ,

Probably you could try the SQLDump tool which dumps a MSSQL database as
a text file.  Mostly it should work with MySQL except for a few
modifications to the SQL.

  I found that in my /dev directory loop0 ......
loop15 files existed. So to create loop16 ..... loop50
use this script 

for i in `seq 16 50`
do
mknod /dev/loop$i b 7 $i
done

that's it. loop devices 16 thru 50 are created in the
/dev/ directory. Then u pass a kernel boot argument
(if loopback support is compiled in the kernel)
max_loop=50 or insert the module with the same
argument ( if it is compiled as a module) to use all
the 50 loop devices. 

Now u can mount upto 51 (0 .... 50) iso images to see
their contents. To mount an iso image file u use 

mount -o ro,loop fedora-core-1.iso /mnt

/mnt is my dest dir and fedora-core-1.iso is my iso
img file. This uses the first available free loop
device, in my case it used the /dev/loop0 and mounted
the iso image. Got it ???

Message-ID: <20040428165424.9584E3945@sitemail.everyone.net>

Hi everybody,

I have a Intel865GLC motherboard. I tried installing Mandrake10. The installation itself was text based. After it started, X is distorted. As one of our friends in the group suggested, I ran the command, xf86config, and after running that, the screen was readable, but I had to move the mouse pointer to the ends of the screen to scroll thro the desktop. After I rebooted my computer, once again I got the same distorted(I mean, I was able to guess what was displayed there, but it has overwritten lots of times) screen again. 

I upgraded my old computer to run Linux in a better way. But unfortunately, from RedHat 9, no distro is support my onboard 865G chipset. Please help me use my linux box.

Iam not a Linux pro. I rarely used Linux, so pls give the information in detail.

Thanks a lot,
Mahesh.

I do. When perl is not feasible (uClibc based RFS and stuff like that).

mostly play with bash and go sed. awk no. I dont have any specific
reasons for avoiding awk or something, just havent used it yet.

do `info libc` and see how many examples you get. Just for an
example. Info pages are giving you almost the complete details (usage,
specifications, limits etc). 

Its inappropriate to say that info pages dont give you examples :)

its the `man` which gives you the explanation for the options, which
is how it should be. I dont want to be shown the examples each time I
want to have a quick look at the list of options a command gives me.

May be you should work on man2 or mane (man with examples). And people
who want to see examples in man pages can use your version of 'man'
pages. I wouldn't want my man pages to have example code, please!

I think we need to refine our terminologies. loop!=loopback. What Sriram 
is talking about is loop devices and what the discussion about is 
loopback interfaces (Network lo interface).

We developed a project (and are still constantly adding further
updates) for exactly the purpose you are looking for.

1. 65000+ users can take test simultaneously (more can be allowed if
   need be but I dont see the point).

2. Different "subjects" can be configured and managed.

3. "Students" get induvidual login/password.

4. No two students get same set of questions, atleast are randomly
   ordered. Randomness depends on number of questions given in
   database.

5. Option to use mysql/postgresql.

6. Uses jsp, mysql or postgres, and C (servers).

7. Client is web-browser.

8. Limits on number of questions, etc are the usual limits imposed by
   the databases. Depending on your need we can choose either of
   mysql/postgres based on this factor.

9. Modularised, new featurees can be added as and when required
   without affecting other modules.

More features are there but am too lazy to type for the 347th time.

If you are interested, any of you, let me know.

Its free (GNU) software costing Rs. 5000.

Dear Friend,

I am extremely interested in knowing how well your approach to selling free
software works out.
Please don't assume that the interest is morbid.
I am genuinely interested in how you face competition, beat it, survive,
etc.
If only I were looking for a software like this, I would immediately buy it,
but not the case now.
I am ready to provide any kind of support that you might need, if and where
possible.
Keep in touch.

Rajendran.

Platform


We developed a project (and are still constantly adding further
updates) for exactly the purpose you are looking for.

1. 65000+ users can take test simultaneously (more can be allowed if
   need be but I dont see the point).

2. Different "subjects" can be configured and managed.

3. "Students" get induvidual login/password.

4. No two students get same set of questions, atleast are randomly
   ordered. Randomness depends on number of questions given in
   database.

5. Option to use mysql/postgresql.

6. Uses jsp, mysql or postgres, and C (servers).

7. Client is web-browser.

8. Limits on number of questions, etc are the usual limits imposed by
   the databases. Depending on your need we can choose either of
   mysql/postgres based on this factor.

9. Modularised, new featurees can be added as and when required
   without affecting other modules.

More features are there but am too lazy to type for the 347th time.

If you are interested, any of you, let me know.

Its free (GNU) software costing Rs. 5000.

I think you haven't read my previous reply to another mail. Anyway I 
will quote that here again.

<quote>
Some guidelines for the members receiveing digest are

* Change the subject tag to that of the post you are replying to.
* Don't quote the entire digest for posting three or four lines of message.
* Avoid top posting (Your message over the original message).

No hard feelings.

I think you have to look into your system's clock as well. The date is 
set back.

Be more elobrate on the problem. This information is not enough.

Praveen.
