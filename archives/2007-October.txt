Isn't the "na" for that kanimozhi and the kaNimozhi we are speaking
about different ? I am not sure about which "na" is for what (???????)
One is kani as in fruit and the other is kaNi as in kaNidham or
mathematics, right ?!

KaniniMozhli - I hope, this will not raise any problem :)

But the main problem is, they are not very happy with words like,

In my case too, I can read (that is view, I can't read tamil :) ) in
the kenneth's post, but not in any of the other posts in this thread
(and some of the recent threads). I'm using gmail on firefox.

I appreciate ELCOT's effort. Most of the fonts are looking good. I am not
expert with fonts but I have few questions regarding their fonts.

   1. Since Lastech has created the original fonts, I believe they might
   have used some windows based font creating software. I think these fonts
   have some source format (other than TTF). Does ELCOT provides the fonts'
   source freely?
   2. Most of the fonts look ugly and unreadable at size less than 12
   pts. Only "ELCOT-Kanchi" seems good. It seems font hinting is missing in
   their fonts. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting). What is
   standard font size used in government documents?
   3. If source is available, there is a possibility that other variants
   of these fonts can come out. Somebody can even provide hinted fonts.
   4. What happened to TSCII & UNICODE? Suddenly for me it seems TAM/TAB
   looking like a standard. Am I missing something here?

dotgnu uses C# - mono doesnt. And there is also a big idealogical  
fight between the two groups. Basically the dotgnu group feels that  
Mono is property of Novell, and that it's restrictive acceptance of  
code contributions does not auger well for it to remain open source.

Hello Friends,
             I have developed this website with aim of using Free Softwares
in minimizing E-waste and collaborate with GNU/Linux users in developing
educational videos.

About OPENMaRUN.org and intension behind developing it :-

-->"Learning through videos" The videos will try to teach new users about
open systems. OPENMaRUN.org will seek collaboration of GNU/Linux users to
contribute to  in the video. Aim is to provide high-quality knowledge at a
low cost.Thus resulting in a community that will define a new learning
technique for open systems.

-->"Reuse and Recycle" "Fee Software Foundation aims at keeping the society
values intact. These attempts should not be restricted to software
development. I have extended the FSF philosophy in safeguarding the
environment, with the initial start of cleaning the Ewaste.

To build up a community first step is to find the persons having same
mindset and then motivating them to do good for the community..Through
OPENMaRUN.org I will try my level best to find people trying to save the
environment and who believe in spreading GNU/Linux literacy through videos.

Seeking suggestions and collaboration...

Regards,
Ambuj A. Thacker

I am thankful to Prem,Anoop,Nity and Shakthi Kannan. They visited my site
and gave good  suggestions on improving the site.

P.S. : I have created different threads on mailing list over

Hello Friends,
              GNU/Linux can be used to reduce the Ewaste. There are many
small Linux, LTSP that can help in doing so. But sadly these distributions
are not popular. Old computers can be used as ThinClients too, there are
LTSP packages for almost all the major distribution.Ubuntu has a separate
LTS edition for ThinClients.  Through OPENMaRUN i intend to popularize the
methods of increasing the life span of.

A question that comes to mind is "Where can these OLD computers be
used??"Use thin clients of office work which does not require high
processing,like using OpenOffice.
We can Cluster them.There can be lots of thing that can be done with
GNU/LINUX on old computer.

How can I Contribute?
->By trying out GNU/Linux on old computers and making a list of compatible
hardware.
->If you have old computer and want to reuse it send its hardware
configuration to OPENMaRUN.org.

Contribution in cleaning Ewaste will be acknowledge on the OPENMaRUN.org
website.We all are responsible for our environment and should take all
possible steps to save it. Once gone it will never be the same again.

Hello Friends,
                There have been lots of requests and discussion over
learning Linux in local/native language.Through OPENMaRUN.org I intend to
solve it with collaborating with all the GNU/Linux users.
Screencasting is Video+Audio. Video is same for everyone all that differs is
the Audio. The Audio in the educational videos can be in Local/Native
language. There are software that can add audio to a video.

How can I contribute?
-> By providing audio in your Local/Native language.
-> By making videos on Free Softwares.
-> By teaching the members on HOW to CREATE videos.
-> By pointing out the mistakes in the Videos.
-> By giving valuable suggestions on Improving the Videos.

GNU/Linux is for everyone. Language should not be thought of as a barier in
spreading GNU/Linux.Contribute in making Videos and Audios to overcome this
barier.

Hi
Will anybody point out a software which can read AUTOCAD Drawings (.dwg format) in LInux? Like OpenOffice which can read all MS Office format files, edit them and save them back in .doc or .xls format itself? I would like to read .dwg drawings , edit them and save them in in .dwg format itself.

Guru, Thanks for the feedback. Here is the reply from ELCOT.

We own the fonts but not the source. If needed we can get
the source. No issues. But the source cannot be distributed
freely. We have an agreement for free hosting of the fonts
and not the source.

Our standard font size is 12 points. We did not evaluate
below 12.

We will look into this area.

TAM/TAB is the standard as of now. The Government may come

It would be good to have the source available too. This in effect can
actually provide impetus to those who wish to contribute towards
improving the fonts. Additionally, along with the source, the
redistribution (including packaging) rights should be available and the
statement provided publicly

> Our standard font size is 12 points. We did not evaluate

It is normally desired to check till around pt 8. Indic fonts have been
traditionally not so good at below 12 pt - if one can get good fonts
that handle till 8 pt then it would be nice.

One suggestion - instead of sending 5 or 6 informational emails about

Being supported by VLC does not make a format open any more that the 
Microsoft office formats are made open due to Openoffice.org support. 
The format is still proprietary and has patent encumberances in several 
regions.

If you want to use a truly open format, there are several good choices.

Do you know the most surprising thing???
In last mail, i told that, i have configured my sound card. But, the day
after that day, i started my machine and surprisingly watch that, "NO SOUND
AGAIN!!!!!!!"

Now, i am using Ubuntu 7.04. 8-(

So, again, i wants to know that, in kernel-2.18; is there any way to
configure the REALTEK sound card?

Zico

Hello,

Thank you for the suggestion all the videos at OPENMaRUN.org will be
converted to openfomat.

I created different threads to ease in discussion..

Rather, why can't the list have a bogofilter or something to filter
out such obvious spam? After all, to err is human. Kicking him out is

Worse,he might not be even aware that the spam is spent out by the
service he signed up.

These services ask for the gmail (or yahoo or hotmail) password and
email everyone in the address book.

Thanks Bharathi, Kenneth, Amachu, Thyagarajan, Raman for the responses.

I spoke to the Jaya TV personnel again.

Every week one day will be on IT, computer related topics.

A comment from producer:
'???????????? ?????? ???? ??????????????? ???????? ????.
???????????????? ?????? ?????????????? ????????? ??????. ??????????
??????????? ????? ?????? ???????? ???????.'

'The audience are mostly from outside Chennai. Make it simple for them
to understand'

Looking at the program timing (12 noon to 1 pm), most likely viewers
are Home makers, elders, Students and Unemployed youth.

We should decide whether how we can present Open Source to such an
audience? Do they need exposure to Open Source principles now?

anbudan,

Tech Tip: Checking the Integrity of a Transfer

There are situations in which we have to check the integrity after a
transfer. This could be from the network, a CD/DVD, USB or hard disk.
In such cases, errors can creep in and partial transfer or corrupted
transfer is possible. When faced with the necessity to ensure the
integrity of critical data, one could use one of these approaches.

  $ sha1sum

Executing this command at both ends should result in identical
outputs. This works for all files, text or binary. You could also do
the same thing with OpenSSL or GNU Privacy Guard.

  $ openssl -sha1
      or
  $ gpg --print-md sha1

You could also use diff or cksum for this but the above approach is
better. Or if you have the luxury to execute sha512sum at both sides,
it is even better!

HTH :)

Which manual? Anyway its lots easier to use wvdial or KPPP. Its been
discussed quite a few times before. There may be minor variations in
instructions depending on the model of your phone.

Eh ? Does the Shelfari's spamming any way similar to Janani's post,
which IMHO was a journalist trying to get the views from the people in
this list (as well as many other LUG lists in India). It was just a
single post requesting for people who are interested, to reply.
Remember we also get multiple post on things when it could have been
put in brief in a single mail, aren't they as bad as a troll ?

And am not sure the Sriram:M$ thread you are mentioning was a series
of arguments and counter arguments or a troll.

Anyway, I did the same mistake with Shelfari too but rather used a
separate mail id. But still, it sends mail to every one in your
contact list even when you unselect them and ask it not to send mails
to them. My personal experience thought me at some point one might
also think something to be genuine and fall prey to it, but at least
make sure you use a mail id that you do not use for mailing lists (or
donot have your mailing list email id in the contact list of the mail
id you use for such things).

Send it to them, and what? You need to think twice before you fling such 
baseless statements at a straight-forward and principled journalist!

If I like a new feature in a M$ product, I will write about that. If I do 
not like some aspect of GPLv3, I will write about that as well. I will write 
what I believe in, as long as I have the knowledge, facts and expert-backing 
to comment on it. But I will make it clear what I plan to write about and 
what I plan to do with the inputs I collect from the community. If you 
noticed (which I am sure you didn't), I clearly stated the reasons for 
seeking inputs from mailing list members. That added context and meaning to 
the discussion -- unlike THIS unjustified statement of yours.

And sir, I might run Windows on my laptop (which is probably the next thing 
you'll point out in your pointless discussion) and I might not contribute 
code to FOSS projects, but in my profession, I practice the philosophy of 
freedom as much as possible -- which might even be more than what you do or 
can do in yours. Publishing most of my work (including my articles, photos, 
blogs, cookbook content etc) under Creative Commons is just one of them.

If you want to discuss this further, do so offlist with me, please, without 
wasting everybody else's bandwidth!

Cheers!

Dear Ilugies

I run an email server in office which also acts as a proxy server(using squid). Of late i am facing problems with squid. What is happening is that the proxy server suddenly stops working then again starts working after say 5 minutes. I thought there must be something wrong with the net connection but my email server operations is not disrupted. Have attached a snapshot of the error message. Hope somebody can help.

Check if DNS was reachable at those times. Your mail log will also show 
errors resolving domains then. Internal emails will work but outgoing 
would have problems.

If you are using DNS servers of your ISP, most likely this is the issue. 
If the log shows that as the problem, use the likes of OpenDNS servers 
for DNS resolution.

What does anyone think of MS allowing people access to the source (to
view, not to add/edit) for the .NET framework?

For me that sounds like a setup - if there is anyone on this list who is
working on developing code for Mono, Rotor etc, may I caution you against
looking at the source code for the MS's .NET framework? Because if you do
look at the source code, then MS can claim that you are stealing the code
for Mono/Rotor.

all the files giving this 404 error have the same time stamp of early morning 
on oct 2 (and are available now). this would appear to be a transient issue 
with attempted client update while the archive was still updating. 
ubuntu@ftp.iitm is having a problem with this because daily updates are 
approaching 1 gb. with this kind of volume, the archive update is taking 
almost all day - and anyone updating is prone to this issue. one can easily 
verify if this is the problem by looking for the archive-update-in-progress 
file at the root of the ubuntu tree.

God knows I have had my share of flamewars when I was younger. But this one
is entirely silly, and Diraivam is entirely wrong to compare Janani's
articles to spam, and to badly setup social networking sites like shelfari.

I was impressed by Janani's reply, personally speaking.

Subject: [Ilugc] Announcing Fedora 8 Test 3 (7.92)!
Message-ID: <470503C3.4020000@fedoraproject.org>

Fedora 8 Test 3 is here! This is the last test release before the
development freeze and a great time to test all those packages that you
know and love. Test 3 is for beta users. This is the time when we must
have full community participation. Without this participation both
hardware and software functionality suffers.

Fedora is a Linux-based operating system that showcases the latest in
free and open source software. Fedora is always free for anyone to use,
modify, and distribute. It is built by people across the globe who work
together as a community: the Fedora Project. The Fedora Project is open
and anyone is welcome to join.

Up-to-date release notes for Fedora 8 Test 3 can be found at
http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes.

== Changes from Fedora 8 Test 2 ==

  * Online Desktop provides a desktop experience designed around online
services. A preview of Online Desktop is provided via BigBoard, which is
a optional sidebar in GNOME.

  * KDE 3.5.7 is available in the KDE Live image as well as the regular
DVD. The KDE 4 (Beta) Development Environment is available in the
repository.

  * Live installations are faster and require a smaller root filesystem.
The file system layout has also changed somewhat.  System files for the
Live images are now under `LiveOS/`, and a new `README` file has been
provided as a short introduction to the live image.

  * Package management now features much better performance via `yum` and
friends.

  * The completely free and open source Java environment called Iced Tea
is installed by default.  Iced Tea is derived from OpenJDK, includes a
browser plugin based on GCJ, and is available for both x86 and x86_64
architectures. GCJ is still the default on PPC architecture.

  * CodecBuddy is now included, and promotes free, superior quality, open
formats to end users trying to play multimedia content under patent
encumbered or proprietary formats.

  * Bluetooth devices and tools now have better graphical and system
integration.

  * Laptop users benefit from the "quirks" features in HAL, including
better suspend/resume and multimedia keyboard support.

  * There is now improved power management thanks to both a tickless
kernel in `x86` and `x86_64` architectures, and a reduction in
unnecessary processor wakeups via `powertop`.

  * Eclipse 3.3 (Europa), a new release of the great IDE and development
platform, is available as part of this release.

  * The `pam_console` module has been removed in favor of access control
via HAL, which modernizes the desktop.

  * NetworkManager 0.7 provides improved wireless network management
support. It includes support for multiple devices and provides the
capability of system-wide configuration, among many other enhancements.
This transition may induce some regressions temporarily, and more
testing and feedback is appreciated.

  * Secure remote management capability is now provided for Xen, KVM, and
QEMU virtualization.

  * Transifex provides a web-based translation interface to allow users
to contribute translation work for Fedora hosted projects as well as
being able to provide translations to upstream directly to any upstream
project.

  * Integration of unique build IDs into Fedora's software building
infrastructure now provide enhanced debugging capabilities and core
dumps.

  * Fedora now offers easier rebranding of Fedora derivatives via a
`generic-logos` software package. Changes in Fedora's mirror structure
also make creation of derivatives easier.

  * Fedora now includes support for Nepali Language, extending its reach
to many more users.

=== What's New in Fedora 8 ===

  * A major list of features is available at
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/8/FeatureList.

=== Release Schedule for Fedora 8 ===

  * The Fedora 8 release schedule can be found at
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/8/Schedule. Fedora 8 is scheduled
for general release on 8 November 2007.

=== How to Get Fedora 8 Test 3 ===

  * Fedora 8 Test 3 can be installed via Live image, regular DVD, or via
network installation.  You can find the DVD images as well as the
primary live images at:

http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/publiclist/Fedora/7.92/

  * You can also download the DVD and Live images via bittorrent at:

http://torrent.fedoraproject.org

  * More information on the various spins available with the release of
Fedora 8 Test 3 is available at:

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/F8Test3/Spins

People who are already running the rawhide (development) branch of
Fedora or any of the previous test releases can simply run `yum update`.
(Some current Rawhide packages might be newer than Fedora 8 Test 3
packages.)  We also appreciate new installation testing for feedback on
changes to the Anaconda installer.

== Known Issues ==

  * [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=302381 Bug 302381] If
you are installing via DVD or also possibly NFS-mounted ISO images, the
Add/Remove Programs application (`pirut`) may crash when run, with a
traceback about HAL. Running `yum update` or using `yum` to update at
least `pirut` should resolve the issue.

  * [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=298991 Bug 298991] The
KDE NetworkManager frontend `knetworkmanager`, a graphical interface for
switching between networks easily, is currently broken. This is intended
be fixed before Fedora 8 release. The KDE Live images have `nm-applet`,
which works with KDE, enabled by default as a workaround.

  * Other Common issues can be found at
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bugs/F8Common.

=== Bug Reporting and tracking ===

You can follow the procedure outlined in
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugsandFeatureRequests to report any bugs
found in your testing.

The Release Engineering and QA teams keep track of bugs that are
considered release blockers. To see that list, visit:

  *http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/showdependencytree.cgi?id=F8Blocker

To see a list of additional non-blocker bugs that should hopefully be
fixed for Fedora 8, visit:

  *http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/showdependencytree.cgi?id=F8Target

Please check these lists before reporting new bugs!

I don't see what good the .NET framework source can do when it can only 
be viewed. Certainly sounds like a setup.

Doesn't matter whether Mono, Rotor developers look at the source or not.

Actually it does matter. Right now Mono and Rotor developers can claim
that theirs is a clean room implementation of the .NET framework (that is,
it is not contaminated by any code borrowed from MS's .NET framework).

It will be difficult in the future to make that assertion now that the
.NET framework code is available for viewing.

That's what I meant.
Now that the source of .NET framework is open for viewing, M$ will go 
right out accusing the open source developers irrespective of the fact 
whether they have actually taken something from .NET source or not.

Hi
 
To upgrade my home system I have already purchased  an AMD Anthlon 64 X2 4000+ AM2 processor and Asus M2A VM motherboard. I am planning to dual boot Windows XP and Ubuntu 7.4. I understand that the onboard integrated graphics (a Radeon X1250) don't work with the free linux drivers (neither xf86-video-ati nor -avivo). Before installing ubuntu 7.04, I would like to know whether anybody in the group have successfully solved this problem. I shall appreciate any useful tips / links.
 
Thanks.

I found that QCAD opens the AUTOCAD Files which are saved in .dxf format. But it only opens, thats all ....... No hatching lines are seen. Dimension lines are grotesque ..... Dimensions are in miniscule font size........

I am yet to download BRL CAD and use it. Does it offer smooth transition like Open office offers for MS Word files ( no loss of formatiing, fonts not getting distortrd etc.,)?

Airtel? I believe you have to add the line:
Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","airtelgprs.com","",0,0

in your /etc/wvdial.conf. I'm not sure about motorola. And if not
airtel, you have to replace airtelgprs.com with you IPN for your
provider.

Secondly, why are you dialling *99***3#? Do you have multiple
connections on your mobile? Try *99#.

And yes, you have to run it as root.

Why as root? Having correct permissions on the dev files wont help? I
think in ubuntu, this is by adding yourself to the group dialout.

On tata indicom data card that I use, I usually see this when the signal
connectivity is very low. I move to a better place and then it works
fine. I do not know if there is a way to see the signal strength similar
to the UI they provide on windows. But since you are using a phone, you
can check that on the phone.

I have faced the same problem changing the number between any of this
3 should solve the problem.

*99***1# or *99***2# or *99***3#.

You need to switch mail clients to something like Eudora (dead now being
reinvented on top of t'bird as "penelope") or Pegasus Mail (dead after
being developed for years as its developer David Harris ran out of cash to
continue developing it)

I've read about these and did not want to go that way as it was not 
supported. Was wondering if Thunderbird had plugins that I do not know 
that can munge headers based on rules, pipe mails thro' a program etc....

Definitely is. Looks I'dve to wait for 3.0 beta win binary release. Do 
not have VC and so cannot patch and compile 2.0.

It should work . But you will be limited to the accelerations available  with r300.
You can try the fglrx , I am not sure about fglrx for this model though,

Dear ILUGC,

We know Dr. Kalam was a FOSS advocate, and as soon as he was told that
his own (President's) web site was powered by non-free technologies,
he had it switched to a FOSS based server. But I think the
de-Kalamization (read de-FOSSization) has started with his exit:

Hey,
	The default fglrx driver supplied as a part of Restricted Drivers
repository in Ubuntu 7.04 is version 8.34.8 (Very old). The new OpenGL
codebase based fglrx (8.41.7) driver supports your card (X1250). Download
this driver and build the kernel module using Module assistant. All will
work fine except for TV/out, some slight video tearing when using Xv, and no
AIGLX (wait for 8.42 for possible support).

Regards,

Why is using Microsoft IIS likened to "sugam"? I disagree.

Another example: it is a kind of sugham that the dynasties of India

While my views may seem controversial, I really don't think people
controlling the web affairs of the President of India are as aware or
are willing to take any initiative like Dr. Kalam. In short, I don't
think they care for principles like Freedom.

Message-ID: <20071008141001.GA14745@lakshmi.susmita.org>

Dear all,

My friend's company in Mumbai has a need for a person who can develop 
a linear programming model with constraints.

The idea is to develop an algorithm to solve problems like inventory
allocation in which the effectiveness is determined by various
constraints.

I don't think the math will be too complicated. If you have enough
common sense and a basic aptitude in math and algorithm design you can
do it.

If you feel you are upto the task get in touch with me.

For the right person, as far as I understand money is not a constraint.

Thanks for your attention.

Best,
Girish

well, 'working for iit' does offer some non-monetary benefit - and it usually
translates into monetary benefits a year or two later when they seek jobs
elsewhere. in the last seven years, we have managed to find three candidates in
a series of replacements.

well, if that file wasn't present, then i dont know where the problem is. we are
syncing from the master mirror and if the sync was successful, we should have a
replica of the master site. anyways, i have upgrades to a newer version of rsync
so that delay-updates is supported. this should take care of parts of the tree
being mutually out of sync. lets see if the error goes away.

Why will the server software change if the Prez changes? This seems very
strange. Doesn't it? I mean, it is not the Prez who is the sysadmin.
Was the earlier software not as good as the new one? Or have commercial
interests penetrated the Rashtrapathi Bhavan?
If the server software there has been changed, can we safely assume that
this process has been replicated across all government websites?

+1.

I have directly experienced this; way back in 1995, I started working
as a customer support engineer with most of my clients being the
various departments in IIT, Madras.

And the experience gained from such client interactions has proved to
be quite invaluable -- such exp carried weightage with prospective
employeres, and personally to me, IIT, Madras was one among the first
places, where I got to work on GNU/Linux and SUN Solaris systems :-)

working for AU-KBC at MIT also offers the same sort of benefit, but I  
still find that the candidates who turn up need to be trained - and  
usually leave at triple the salary the moment they are trained

Mr. Karthik Ramgopal, thanks for your suggestions. I
am still a newbie to Linux. I have decided to wait for
the release of ubuntu 7.10 and fglrx 8.42. Hope both
will be available soon.

he is the embedded guy - but I dont think he works on RTLinux. AU-KBC  
has done a lot of work on RTLinux, but it is not opensource work

It is alike and kicking. Thank you.  More details at

http://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page

It is a long term effort and a number of patches are already merged in 
the upstream kernel.

Dear Ilugies
 
I have built a file server using ubuntu 7.04 server edition. I have created a samba share in the name of dwg for which i have listed the configuration below. The problem i am facing is that I am not able to see any files present in the subdirectories when i open the share using windows xp client. For example there is a directory called 1 which is present under dwg. This directory has got some files and some more directories. But when I open 1 all i see is a blank screen
 
[dwg]comment = Drawing Folderbrowseable = yespath = /home/dwgcreate mask = 0664locking = nodirectory mask = 0775writable = yeswrite list = @design
Am not able to find out where i am going wrong.

Subject: [Ilugc] Wiil GRUB on Debian ETCH or FC7 dual boot WIN XP?
Message-ID: <000a01c80a90$e993b900$0201a8c0@DATAONE>

Hi all,

I saw recently an installation of Ubuntu 7.04 in PC with exisitng WIN XP in which  GRUB  installed on the MBR recognised the existing WIN XP OS and dual booting was going on smoothly.

This was one of the reasons I did not venture to install Linux on my friends' machines which had WIN XP  though they wnated to try out linux.

My question is, whether the GRUB bootloader of the DEBIAN 4.0 DVD's supplied with LFY of AUG'07  or the FC7 (JUL 07) does also recognise WIN XP  and dual boot ?

Has any of the list members done it ? If you give me a confident yes, a minimum of 6 friends are waiting on whose machines  I will install Debian 4.0 over the weekend.
Pl give some leads.

NS Srikanth

I dont see any reasons, why it will not. During the normal
installation, it will ask you for the dualboot options. As long as you
are careful that you dont install debian over your windows partition,
you are good.

Please google on "howto grub" [without the quotes] on more options on
how to add more operating systems to your grub menu.

No direct help here. But this article could help.

http://www.linux-mag.com/id/785/

(You only have to create a free userid to view it)

I am also attaching my code to browse samba shares. I did not write it
completely; I got hints from the samba code base.

All the best!

Fedora 7 recognizes Windows and shows that in the boot options. You need 
to enable it in the boot options during installation if you prefer a 
menu by default.

>>>The problem i am facing is that I am not able to see any files present in
the subdirectories when i open the share using windows xp client


With Ubuntu the usual problem is  file sharing  permissions. It is not the
same as Redhat as far as i remember.
Try changing the permissions of the directory in which you are holding the
data . , try giving umask options for all, then try restarting the service.
this should work. if it works then you know that the devil is in the details
of your permissions.
The default mask for the directory is 0755.
Remember always GNU/Linux file system permissions are of a higher priority
than that of the samba file permissions.
Also  do make sure that your work group name is the same Windows Network
Neighborhood Work group .please edit the line for work group accordingly in
the smb.conf file.please make sure that you do not have any access
restrictions in the same file preventing the access using ip addresses.
Hope this helps.

But a caveat, i worked with ubuntu a longtime back during 5.10  since then i
have gone back to Redhat /Debian  as my favorite distros. so  i might not
actually be up to date.

Regards
Raj

Dear ILUGC,

I give up on the Wiki spam issue. The page I am interested in is Find
Your Distro, and I removed all spam on it yesterday evening, only to
fidn that the spam is back this morning again.

This won't do. PLEASE install some captcha and/or disable unauthorized
edits. Something MUST be done immediately!

Thanks.

add the spam control stuff also into that.

Yes Debian does recognised Win XP. I have done not less than 25 such
installations. I have never faced problem with it.

Subject: [Ilugc] The Linux Delhi Hall of Shame: resurrected.
Message-ID: <20071010091422.GA15104@localhost>

Dear ILUGC,

I am working on resurrecting the erstwhile Linux Delhi Hall Of Shame,
which lists a set of (typically Indian or useful to Indian) websites
which are not standards compliant, in the sense that they are designed
to work with specific proprietary software applications or operating
systems. Full details of criteria and current list of sites in the
Hall of Shame are available here:

http://wiki.linux-delhi.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Main/HallOfShame

I would request you to familiarize yourself with the criteria which
warrant additions to the list, and add relevant sites to the list as
well. If you do not want to edit the Wiki yourself, please mail me and
I shall add the site to the Wiki.

I appreciate your comments and suggestions. Please help in making this
effort a success.

Thanks are due to Raj "Raju" Mathur for his advice in helping me get
this done.

Thank you.

Kumar

What about sharekhan's site - www.sharekhan.com?

Did you verify the permissions of the file system for the  directories. not
under the smb.conf. but the file system  permissions

One general comment I got from the people who are using the file server is that the present file server running ubuntu 7.04 is faster than the previous server(It was an ibm e-series server running windows 2000 server edition). This comment has boosted my spirits and am slowly planning to convert all the servers and some desktops to linux based so that the cost incurred in upgrading them can be reduced.

It would be better to use liberation fonts rather than the restrictive 
licensed fonts if you need metric equivalents

http://www.redhat.com/promo/fonts/

Also the display of fonts in many cases is affected by font rendering 
engine (freetype) differences rather than the fonts themselves.

Hi,
Glad that it helped, one suggestion  is go to the samba official site -- you
have a book from Oreilly which can be viewed online and many more tips and
tricks about samba.if you want some thing really fast -- try Free NAS-- it
is based on Free BSD and has a very small footprint. Mind you this is
dedicated for file serving and does not do any thing else

This is the 1st time, we interacting with them. I hope, now only
they are started understanding What is FOSS? During the preshow
discussion, I req them include Linux in some of the Q to bring
discussion to my ctrl. But they said, No company(!?) name in Q. Then
I took 5 more min to explain what is Linux. But No use.

I hope, after few more interactions, we can make one spearate
program with Linux or FOSS as a topic. During the ILUGC meet, We
will talk more about my funny exp in Jaya TV.

In freenas is it possible to give rights according to groups. The main reason is that i want to restrict file access to certain users based on the group they belong to. In the freenas server site they had mentioned that right now it is not possible to give rights on a group basis

Thanks for all the responses.

After trying over phone for more than 20 days with customer support
today one person came and solved the problem. The sim card was
inserted in the wrong direction!. (I also did not bother to check that
:-( He put it back properly and everything is fine.

For the record, here is the procedure to connect this modem to
internet (Open Suse 10.2)

1. Insert the Modem in USB port (USB drive is loaded and modem is recognized)
2. run wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf to create the configuration script.
3. Edit the script to :
[Dialer Defaults]
Modem = /dev/ttyACM0
Baud = 460800
Init1 = ATZ
Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0
Init3 = AT+CRM=1
ISDN = 0
Modem Type = Analog Modem
Phone = #777
Username = internet
Password = internet
stupid mode =1
4. type wvdial

and start browsing. The speed is pretty good.

Thanks for all the help. I learnt a few useful commands (route, arp).
Sorry for the trouble.

anbudan,

Ma Sivakumar

rotfl - but messing up the hardware is the best way to learn. You  
have to try everything under the sun and nothing works, but in the  
long run you have learnt a hell of a lot of things. I once worked 2  
days trying to get sound out of my machine, and I finally realised  
that I didnt have speakers attached ;-)

Here's the reply from #awk@irc.freenode.net

[23:31] <karolisl> floyd_n_milan: awk '1' file
[23:31] <karolisl> try this one.
[23:31] <karolisl> it would work the same as cat.
[23:32] <floyd_n_milan> so what exactly does it do?
[23:33] <karolisl> floyd_n_milan: IMO, it works as : or true in shell
[23:33] <floyd_n_milan> hmmm
[23:34] <floyd_n_milan> same as print then?
[23:34] <karolisl> (in this case)
[23:34] <karolisl> floyd_n_milan: one can omit print
[23:34] <karolisl> awk '/foo/'
[23:34] <karolisl> awk '/foo/' file
[23:34] <karolisl> would work as a grep/.
[23:34] <floyd_n_milan> it does :
[23:34] <karolisl> because, if a pattern/an address/a condition is specified, 
awk defaults to print as an action for that block

are you giving a prize for the list that gives you the best answer?  
If not, what is the justification for x-post of something off topic  
anyway. For what it's worth I use Tektonic.net, stable - practically  
no downtime. Costs are on the website.

 Oops forgot to put [OT] along with [x-posted] purpose is to Identify
the vendors in linux based VPS and evaluate the QoS.

 Thanks for the suggestion and for pointing out the mistake.

Dear Readers,

To begin with apologies for posting the October 2007 Sneak Preview
rather later.

Now, were were we? Yes! I'm sure you know that virtualisation is the
latest buzz. And therefore we've dedicated our October 2007 issue to
detailed articles on various Free and Open Source virtualisation
technologies to give you an idea of what's the reason behind the "buzz".
Following are the five articles you can check out in this special issue:

* A Hitchhiker's Guide to Virtualisation, where we briefly cover the
technology and how hardware assists come into play. Then, we try and
analyse how Xen can take advance of a virtualisation-capable processor.

* Xen Live Migration Using iSCSI Target: Here we show you how to
successfully migrate a live Xen virtual machine from one physical server
to another, without interrupting any service.

* Virtualise with Bochs and QEMU: In here we try and analyse how to use
two easy-to-follow technologies, and have tried to avoid too much
technical jargon - it's as simple as follow the instructions and set up
a virtual guest OS in no time.

* Spartan Virtualisation with Lguest: So, who's heard of Lguest? It's a
mare 6,000 line virtualisation solution that has been integrated into
the mainline kernel, and you can get a sneak peak once Linus releases
keenel 2.6.23. However, since we couldn't have waited that long, we
straight away went ahead with an RC release to give you a an idea of
what's coming.

* High-Speed Virtualisation with KVM-How it Works: Well, KVM was the
first solution that was added to the mainline kernel back in the days of
kernel 2.6.20. Here we try and find out wot's ...uh the deal with it.

The October issue of LFY has already hit the stands! So if the concept
of virtualisation intrigues you, then we can assure you this issue won't
disappoint you.

Also in this issue you'll find:

in that case, it is not OT - but you should have been precise, saying  
that this was a survey of linux hosting

Hi,
thats interesting. dint know cud use irc for that.

are there any forums/ user groups where one could get
feedback on code?

sometimes while coding, we get mistakes and fix it.
But the reason for mistake is not clear and the
information is not clear in books either.

thanks,

Hi,
this sounds interesting. Will the speaker be using any
presentation slides? If so, could you distribute them?
or would it be like just discussion?

Which "this"? Please do not top post!

Akarsh has prepared slides, which he'll make available later today.

I use IRC for that.

Btw, `dint know cud' would not be welcomed on IRC, the same as here on this 
mailing list. :)

Message-ID: <3c52da3c0710130347j6d7f400cy42f5663492f5acb4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm having some trouble with my HP nx6110's screen... I am finding it
quite dull/dim... the white is not like proper white, its more of the
whiteness of a faded old white shirt...  (even on maximum brightness)

So firstly can someone suggest me some software solutions? I tried
xgamma and displaycalibrator, but got poor results.. and the white
remained a bit dull...

A post on HP's forums, and I get the suggestion that I should not
compare my screen with another monitor... and that I should compare it
with an nx6110's screen... does anyone have an nx6110 or similar
model? Does anyone have any similar problems with it? Is it the case
that you're perfectly satisfied with its whiteness?

And just to be certain... this issue can't be a software issue can it?
(I don't want to install windows just for the sake of testing that:) )

Thanks,
--Arnold

Something should run in the background that'll search
for subjects such as "orkut", "facebook", "myspace"
"Yaar!" in the subject line and bounce them, instead. :)

It would be a big burden on the moderator. If he does not moderate 
within short intervals, messages will get queued and be delivered late. 
Distribution of load by each one of us deleting a few mails daily, IMHO 
is faster. Remember this is honorary work and so will get attention 
during spare and not prime time.

I'd loathe a moderating job if all I was doing was deleting spam mails.

Yup. Please shift to Bangalore and join the BLUG list if you need moderation

if you notice one thing we dont get spams from the good ones be it facebook
or orkut or linkedin for that matter..
all these not so good ones are the ones that actually create so much fuss.

In such a case wouldn't self service be a good idea?
I believe almost all mail clients/services allow you to
set up filters. So, you can probably filter out such
unwanted stuff yourself rather than relying on others.
Thus, you'd get your way without over burdening the
moderators.

I am sorry if you don't feel that this is constructive, but here is my
view on this:

1. The mailing list's policy (followed by all, even if not presented
in writing), is to write clear English and not SMS speak.

2. Mrugesh advises you to use similar language in IRC because IRC
users follow strict etiquettes rules. I think this is reason enough.

3. I would request you to avoid top posting. And here's the reason:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting
:-)

Hope this clarifies matters. Have fun on the list!

I use VPSland reasonably , they are good.
You can also consider slicehost .
Slicehost is really good but its hard to get a slice from them and often 
requires advance booking !

 Now this gives birth to another question. Which is more stable
virtualization technology Virtuazzo or Xen ? Those using
virtualization might be able to throw some light.

Most of the service providers out there seem to beusing virtuzzo  ! 
Maybe its the admin interface on top of it which makes it attractive :)

Message-ID: <e977d4310710132122q1051a5afme3932a7efcca12ca@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have got Kubuntu FF (7.04) on my PC. When  I try to play VCDs, the
player crashes, but DVDs work fine. When I try to copy the .DAT file,
it gives me an IO Error. The same VCDs used to work fine on Dapper.
Google doesn't seem to give any workable solution. Has any one of you
used VCDs on their Feisty Fawns or should I wait for a week to get
7.1.0?

PS: It has been some embarrassment for me when I was showing off Linux
to some newbies.

Natarajan

http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML-single/en/MPlayer.html#vcd

This is the reason you are not able to copy the DAT file also.

I have experienced the same problem with mplayer.

I have no idea how to solve it but my experience is that gentoo linux plays
VCDs properly but OpenBSD doesn't.

However with DVDs, there is no such problem.

You will have to install w32codecs, add the repository from
debian-multimedia.org and the usual apt-get stuff follows

wmv = Windows Media Video. It is a container that can contain either 
older version of video codecs or the newer standard codec (VC-1) for 
HD-DVD, Blu-ray discs.

wmv decode was added to ffmpeg libraries only sometime this year. The 
version of ffmpeg in Sarge and hence the Mplayer, VLC or any media 
player that is in Sarge and uses ffmpeg wont have the decoding 
capabilities for wmv.

If you are using the debian-multimedia.org repository you will find all 
the components for playing back any video file. But I am not sure if the 
version they have for Sarge has all the latest improvements. Your only 
choice may be to install the legally dubious w32codecs package from there.

Senthil

I had never tried to use mplayer earlier. I tried with mplayer
"vcd://2" and it works now. But Xine reports that "no input plugin
available for....". Now that I can watch the VCD using mplayer, i
don't have a control panel in mplayer to adjust the
contrast/brightness/ or fast forward. The video out of mplayer is too
bright and very little contrast.

xine used to work just fine for me when I was with dapper.

Try gmplayer with the same arguments. It might work, and has a
semblance of a GUI.

This is easily taken care of.

Start mplayer with -vf hue and use the keys 1,2 for brightness
decrease/increase, 3,4 for contrast decrease/increase and so on.

Everything is of course documented very well in the mplayer man page.

I have never had to use any media player other than mplayer.

Only problem with mplayer is it does not grok dvd menus. Other than
that, there is nothing that mplayer cannot do that some other software
can. :)

Yes, xine needs plugins and other stuff and its DVD decryption can
sometimes be very slow. mplayer has no such problems.

I have played every playable format with mplayer. In fact there is no
player on earth that can play more formats than mplayer.

You have to download the Win32codecs binary and unpack it under the
right location.

I think it is 

/usr/lib/win32

More details here.

http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML-single/en/MPlayer.html#codec-importing

If you take the time to read mplayer's documentation you will never look
any further.

You are also welcome to read my article on the same in the current issue
of linuxjournal.

Obtaining the magazine in India is hard, so you better wait for a month
when they will put it up online. 

Best,
Girish

And while you are about it you may care to install the Real codecs as

I had hosted on a Xen machine, until the guys running the machine  
finally got fed up and said that Xen doesnt cut it and shifted to  
virtuozzo - note: I know nothing about either of them.

Thanks Girish. I have  configured mplayer plugin in Kaffeine  through
KMPlayer. It now gives me a brightness contrast menu when I right
click. But the problem is that it doesn't autoplay. I have to select
vcd://2 instead of vcd:// for mplayer to detect my CD.

XINE documentation says that vcd works out of the box, and it used to
work for me earlier. I have got xineplug_inp_vcd.so and vcdo.so
configured, but still couldn't get it working. I will wait for a week
to get my hands on the new Kubuntu before experimenting further.

Moderation is for all or none - cannot be done selectively. You atleast 
need to glance a mail for recognising spam even if you do not moderate

All the messages which come from the so called "Social Networking
sites" can be found out by reading the subject line. So I do not think
that the whole mail should be read.

If things were so simple, filters in email clients would do; reiterate 
again the fact that we need to keep load on a select few volunteers 
minimal. What you suggest involves reading subject line -  the intent I 
also wanted to convey but failed perhaps.

Spammers rarely send mail with real addresses. One thing leads to 
another and we will have users asking for good spam control. Guys make a 
living out of spam control and it is not a simple thingy.

I volunteer for reading subject lines and deleting mails. Because in
the office I have internet. I can devote around 10 minutes in each
hour to do this work

the list is not moderated - even if you volunteer as moderator, first  
it has to be decided to moderate the list - which I dont think will  
happen. However you are free to spend 10 minutes a day and flame all  
top posters, spammers and the like.

to explain a little more, there are two types of moderated lists:

1. all posts are moderated, which means the list admin has to  
specificaly approve every post, which means that we will all have to  
wait for you to come to your office and approve posts

2. posts of *some* members, who are on the 'rowdy list' are  
moderated. The moderater decides who these people are, and if you get  
on the wrong side of the moderater you are in deep trouble. I have  
experienced this and have sworn never ever to join a list of this sort.

I think what we need is selective censorship as outlined in point 2.
People who join the so-called social networks and have given their
email id and password to the website i think should be put in the
rowdy list.

Dear Ilugies

Once again thanks for all the help provided while i was setting up the
file server. It is going to be nearly 1 week since the fileserver has
gone live and till now no complaints. The general mood among the users
of that server is happiness. They say that the fileserver is faster
than the old windows server.

yes, thanks, i dont want to. besides, i wouldn't know how to play god until it 
is too late. we have a handful of people who thoughtlessly allow these junk 
postings in their name - and i am yet to see any one of them justifying or 
repeating it. people suggest 'use a filter' - if anyone wants to contribute a 
filter that will intelligently catch these, i am game to install it. it should 
put trapped messages in the moderation queue and since i clear it almost every 
day, it will at most mean one day delay if there was a false positive. we use 
postfix and mailman, in case someone wants to contribute this filter.

some corrections here:

1. The first conference will be in Chennai. What I said about II tier  
cities is that the majority of foss people today are coming from a)  
second tier engineering colleges and b) two tier cities - and we must  
focus on getting such people to speak and attend the conference

2. NRC-FOSS will faciliate the conference by giving logistic support,  
handling finances etc, but the conference will be planned and run by  
the Chennai lug (along with other lugs in tamilnadu)

3. The focus of the conference will be at the State level - as we  
feel that it is at state level that real work can be done. However we  
will try and get speakers and developers from all over the country,  
and maybe have miniconferences for them. As far as python people are  
concerned, I am very keen on having a python subconference along with  
the main conference

IMO, it is better not to explicitly state hierarchy when there is an
attempt to create public awareness, and provide knowledge to all.

Mentioning as city, town, or village is ok.

Today, I spent quite a bit of time trying to remove spam only to find
that the Spam was getting re-introduced at the very minute I submitted
the removed version :(.

PS: I have not removed the spam from all the talk pages, but have
cleaned up almost all other pages.

Bala(webadmin) is facing some issues in upgrading to new version, I
hope, it needs PHP5. He is looking into this issue. If we are unable
to upgrade that, then the spam filters will be added.  Bala, Plz
update the list also about the progress.

So it stays on the Linux Delhi Hall of Shame[1].

BTW, Anna University has been removed from that list because someone
acted on the basis of that list, and mailed me to remove it. Impact!

Message-ID: <47140F5B.1010808@gmail.com>

Hi folks,

Please excuse me if this way OT, but I wanted to measure the general 
satisifaction with Dell systems. Currently I'm looking for only one 
desktop system, but it might increase to many in the future, and I am 
keen on standardizing on one vendor. Yes, all the systems will run Linux 
(Ubuntu series in particular) - if you can throw light on some of the 
related issues too, it will be great.

In general, I'm looking for info how long they take to deliver a system 
in Chennai if I order it online, how good their after-sales support is 
and if their general sales strategy is small-business friendly. If you 
know other vendors you would rather recommend/had a good experience 
with, I would be glad to hear it.

Thanks much,
V.

I bought Dells at work and for my personal use. I find their interface 
good and efficient. Service calls for me have been part replacements and 
they went off smoothly. These were not issues that brought the system 
down and thus not critical failures. I got decent next day support at 
work too for desktops. Here too we had spare desktops and daily backup 
of code/pvt repository etc so switching desktops was not difficult.

I like the sales strategy as there is no negotiations and waste of time 
in face to face interaction. That is me and others may feel otherwise.

Overall: very painless to deal with and if one is a knowledgeable user, 
can get work done fasst with Dell.

My motive to purchase first m/c: Complete flexibility in building 
configurations yourself - works well on the web.

I am not sure how it is for businesses, but on a personal plane, Dell's 
service is quite satisfactory. The average delivery time for online orders 
is around 8-14 days but our machine was delivered even earlier. Online 
support for software problems in good. For hardware fixes, they pickup the 
computer the day after you lodge a complaint and return it as soon as 
possible -- and they indicate a time when picking up the comp (We have not 
experienced this personally, but heard so from a friend.)

Cheers!

I apologize. To make up for my goof up in part, I searched and found
this:
http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-159039.html

According to that, the driver got loaded automatically, and thread that
leads to another thread about a different modem which shows similar
problems but lead elsewhere...


Sorry again.

Hi,
     Kenneth is right, there are no "off the box" working USB drivers for
any of the modems. I wrote a site http://modembsnl.blogspot.com for UT-300R
Modem of BSNL, but that too focuses only on Ethernet based connection to the
modem. I would suggest the OP to get a cheap ethernet card for say 150-300Rs
and use the modem. Thats what I recommend for those who have issues with
their USB modems in Windows as well (if it also has an ethernet port).
Ethernet is easy to connect as well and works off the box on Mac, Windows,
Unix families..

and if the modem doesnt have an ethernet port, return it and get one

On the face of it, a good strategy but if systems are purchased over a 
period of time then don't expect same configuration.  The likes of Dell 
purchase in huge volumes so the components may vary from batch to batch 
in the same model line.  Unlike, your local system integrator you do 
not have a choice in specific components in the system.

On the server side, they have a good offering and I have found their 
sales staff more responsive compared to IBM and HP.

I have also found the opposite to be true.  People take out of station 
trips on such occassions.  Expect only the uber geeks.  I think this is 
what happened on a recent conference @ Delhi.   Also keep in mind that 
Linux Asia is around the same time (don't know the exact dates).  You 
may be able to get overseas speakers if you can align your dates.  

My 2 cents :)

Thanks everybody for your comments. No, I'm not expecting the same 
configuration to be available all the time - I just don't want to 
interact with ten different people when I have ten systems. I'd rather 
go with one reliable vendor and stick with him, even if it's a little 
expensive than other options. I don't mind paying more for prompt service.

This is not true. I have been to configure this particular modem (I
think it was this one) over USB for Dataone itself. All you need to do
is plug in via USB, a new ethernet device gets created. Now run
pppoeconf and configure your username/password for that ethernet
device. [Ubuntu Feisty]

Hi,

I just noticed this on the Bombay Stock Exchange's Training Institute
'About' page -http://www.bseindia.com/training/about.asp .

"BSE Training Institute, which is famously known by its acronym BTI,
enjoys the patronage of the entire spectrum of financial community in
India. Recently, BTI has expanded from ? Floor, to 1 ? Floor at

Subject: [Ilugc] [Commercial] Invite suggestions for Open Source India Week
	(LinuxAsia)
Message-ID: <15d601c8108f$a7a7aa10$6401a8c0@JANANI>

Hi all,

LinuxAsia is now morphing into a bigger avatar -- Open Source India Week --  
a three city event that will start on a Monday from Bangalore and end on a 
Friday at Delhi, with a stop at Mumbai on a Wednesday.


How is it different from LinuxAsia as it was?
---------------------------------------------

1. OSIW will be held in three cities: Bangalore, Mumbai and New Delhi

2. The tech track will, almost entirely be, 'by the techies, for the 
techies' (and that's precisely the reason for this email: to request you to 
shape it!)


What is the goal of the event (what sets it apart from other FOSS events in 
India)?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. OSIW is not focused on specific projects, but on the technologies and 
concepts behind these.

For example, workshops on technopreneurship through FOSS models, embedded 
systems, developing applns for mobiles, the future of Web programming (hmm, 
maybe even more power in the user's hands!), etc. What's more, it is not 
just about software but spans the entire gamut of IT solutions that qualify 
as free/open source. For example, technologies like the T-Engine also find a 
place.

2. Also, OSIW aims to foster entrepreneurship through FOSS models.

If any of you run companies based on FOSS, please come forth and encourage 
others. Perhaps it would also be a good idea to bring in venture capitalists 
and get to know their views on FOSS companies, how to pitch to them, etc. It 
would also be nice to highlight what is hot and what is not in terms of tech 
domains so that those with start-up dreams know where to invest their 
energy. Also, I always wonder
how some projects like Ubuntu rose to fame much faster than others, maybe 
others would like to know that too.

3. Companies can also come forth to conduct customised workshops for techies 
and users.

4. The FOSS India awards have also been launched and will be given away at 
the event. Entries are invited (http://www.openitis.com/openitis/index1.php)

I am launching a discussion on behalf of the non-profit FOSII 
(http://fosii.org) to seek the suggestions of the community on workshop 
themes, preferred topics of discussion/talks, suggestions for the event as a 
whole, possible help to link up with keynote speakers, etc -- these will be 
compiled and discussed with the OSIW/LA team.

The wiki is up at http://www.linuxasia.net/twiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome --  
look forward to your suggestions. If you have any nits about the past LA 
episodes to dig up, I am not the person to discuss it with. But if you have 
any suggestions for the upcoming event, I am all ears. So, even if it is 
criticism, disguise it as suggestions please!

I request you to please share your thoughts on the Wiki, and please spread 
this message across the community, so we get more suggestions (already 
posted on Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi and Goa GNU/Linux user group mailing 
lists). Perhaps you can also discuss this at your respective LUG meets and 
share your collective suggestions with us.

Cheers!
Janani

Hi to all,

I want to configure network with srcd in a windows lan network. In windows,
the system is configured with the below configureation.

Description . . . . . . . . : NDIS 5.0 driver

Physical Address. . . . . . : 00-E0-7D-7B-A4-7C
DHCP Enabled. . . . . . . . : Yes
IP Address. . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.3
Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1
DHCP Server . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1
Primary WINS Server . . . . :
Secondary WINS Server . . . :
Lease Obtained. . . . . . . : 10 17 07 12:55:14 PM
Lease Expires . . . . . . . : 10 17 07 3:43:14 PM


the windows route table is as follows:

    Network Address Netmask Gateway Address Interface Metric  0.0.0.0
0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.3 1  127.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 1
192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.3 192.168.1.3 1  192.168.1.3
255.255.255.255 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 1  192.168.1.255 255.255.255.255
192.168.1.3 192.168.1.3 1  224.0.0.0 224.0.0.0 192.168.1.3 192.168.1.3 1
255.255.255.255 255.255.255.255 192.168.1.3 0.0.0.0 1

Here the command I performed to cofigure srcd for network

# dhclient eth0 -s 192.168.1.1

But dhclient failed to configure. After that, I gave te below command

# ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.0

I also put the default gateway as follows

# route -v add 192.168.1.0 gw 192.168.1.3
# route -v add default gw 192.168.1.1

after that I ping the server as

# ping 192.168.1.1

but It failed to detect the server.

but the local loopback is working correctly because when I ping for
192.168.1.3 it gives the correct output. I think this is not a network
driver priblem for srcd. But I am not able to connect the net through srcd.

I am a beginner on network with linux. I will be thankful if anybody help me
to solve this problem.

thanks,
Mohan.

Does your DHCP server assign IP addresses based on MAC addresses? What
if you just did:

    dhclient eth0

-----
| But dhclient failed to configure.

How can you tell? Post output of:

  /sbin/ifconfig -a

Are you sure eth0 is the correct interface?

1. What do you mean by "failed"?
2. Never describe the end result! It doesn't help in troubleshooting.
Post the output/error/log messages.

Is there any interface other than 'eth0', 'lo', 'dummy0' or 'bond0'? because
dhclient used only these three interfaces.. the output of dhclient is here..

Urgh! Please don't send attachments to e-mails sent to mailing lists.
Not everyone is on broadband.

1. From ifconfig output, eth0 is assigned 192.168.1.3 IP address.
2. How come you have 2 gateway (G) entries in "route -n"? Please correct that.

Hi All,

I was trying out kgdb for my development. The test machine I am using
has a Cent OS 5 installed and development machine has a Debian Etch.

KGDB - 2.4 for Kernel version 2.6.15.5.

I compiled the kernel at development macine and installed it target
machine. When I connect the target machine through the serial console
and do a "continue" it is stalling with the following machine,

Warning: unable to open the initial console.

There are lot of such problems reported for vanilla kernel in the net,
but no defnetive solution has been mentioned. I think this has nothing
to do with kgdb, but with some kernel selection option.

Can someone give some directions??

regards,
siva.

Why -s? What does it do?

There should not be a need to use it.

dhclient eth0 alone will suffice.

There is a problem here.

The first route add command is superfluous. The moment you assign an 
IP address to an interface  along with a subnet mask, the reachability
to all the hosts in that network is implicit.

The basic idea of routing is very simple.

Rule 

#1 ) You can only use directly connected machine as the next hop. 
     Which is to say that the gateway should reside on the local
     network/networks and should be reachable without any route.

    The next hop in linux is specified as the argument to "gw"
    parameter.
#2) There should not be more than default route

#3) Any router has at least two interfaces

There are more but this is sufficient for now.

No problem. Routing is hard to understand.

Keep trying. You will succeed.

1. Remove this above route entry and check. 
2. Is pkt or byte counts are increasing in eth0?

Since you said "serial console", do you have a /dev/ttyS0 or
/dev/ttyS1 file on the host system?

Forgot to add that DHCP is a very capable protocol. You can do N number
of things with it.

And it is mainly used not only for dishing out IP addresses but also to

1) configure the default gateway

2) the nameserver

In other words, you don't have to do anything and the whole thing is
automated.

You should never have to diddle around with manual route additions or
anything like that.

Best,
Girish

it is /dev/ttyS0 - I have configured it as 0 in the kernel option.
Just for debug when I pass the parameter console=tty0 during the boot
up, the target system displays the bootup messages in it screen but
hangs at the same point.

Since the conversion is to a proprietory database it better to get
support from the vendors who are paid for supporting you.

My take on this, dump the SQL using mysqldump and run a script on top
of it to convert and slap into MSSQL.

If you can save the MySQL database in csv format, then
MS SQL may be able to read it.

I find kflickr is a nice tool to upload multiple images into flickr.
But, flickr does not supports more than 3 albums.

is there any free web hosting which supports
1. free hosting
2. unlimited albums.
3. an upload tool for linux.

Will picassa and picassaweb.google.com address these? Am not sure
about the number of albums, but it surely has an image editor, viewer
and uploader for Linux and yes it does offer free hosting....

Buzilla is one of the most widely used issue tracker. but its implementation
is bit complex. best tool to use. You could customize it based on ur use.
you need mod_perl , apache & mySQL or postgreSQL for this

XOOPS, CMS has a issue tracking issue tracking module. implementing XOOPS is
very simple.  we  used XOOPS in my our office. You need PHP, apache & mySQL
for XOOPS

codetrack, is a one file issue tracker, for medium size project you can use
this.  very very eazy to implemtent & use. requirement PHP & apache, their
is no need of DB.  since  data's are managed in XML file.

Try trac -- http://trac.edgewall.org/ trac is a ticket tracking system with a
wiki and subversion interface. A lot more features can be added using plugins.

Try Mantis and if you are using subversion, you could also look at Trac.

I guess you ca do this using the update policy. I found this in the Bind
ARM.

( grant | deny ) identity nametype name [ types ]

The last types should be equivalent to types of RR's that can be
updated. I haven't tried it before... so not really sure... If you try
please let us know about your test.

Using TSIG is highly recommended & No point in using IP address if you
need such fine grained access controls in update policy. 


My 2 Cents

You can do this in two stages.

Step 1:
You can use a tool like PhpMyAdmin (or Toad for MySQL) and connect to your
MySQL database and then generate a SQL dump.

Once you have this dump, you can edit the file using a text editor and
make some minor changes in the DDL (create tables statements) to handle
the case of autoincrement fields. MySQL and MSSQL deals with autoincrement
fields a little differently. MS SQL uses something called Identities.

http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mssql/article.php/3307541

Once you have edited this text fields, you can use tools such as Toad on
windows to setup the tables on MS SQL.

Toad for MySQL:

sorry sakthi Kannan.. I have no choice but to attach the output file to give
the exact route table..
The table output goes unordered when I paste it in gmail.. sorry..

Could anyone tell me how windows configure network using dhcp?

1)Why it is configures as 192.168.1.3? I think it is same as Windows
IP. try configuring 192.168.1.4
2) whether ARP is resolved? what is the output of the command "arp" ?

If the ping still fails, i doubt your cables. are you sure it is a
good cross cable? are you able ping from windows using the same cable?

Why was IIT Madras mirror not listed at

Surely its just a case of setting up rsync do its business.

I am involved with the CentOS Project, and we would really like to get
more mirrors in India. Is CentOS something you would consider as well ?

Interestingly, no one has mentioned roundup as yet... its perhaps one of
the most functional issue trackers around at the moment. Well worth a
try. And it has multiple interfaces as well ( which most developers like
) and can do hooks into things like cruisecontrol and conventional build
services.

Interface of a bug tracking system to a source code control and build 
system goes a long way. Larger projects are far easier to manage by 
switch to such systems. Finally a trade-off call between expertise 
available vs complexity. Systems like bugzilla have a lot more 
consultants than others.

Take a look at the output file..   the eth0 is configured as follows

eth0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:E0:7D:7B:A4:7C
          inet addr:192.168.1.10  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

          Interrupt:11 Base address:0x6000

could you tell me what is the use of arp?
and why u suggested not to use 192.168.1.3? because I booted that system
with srcd not with the windows..

Mainly because bugzilla has traditionally needed the consultants, while
most other issue trackers were ok for the $itstaff to setup and manage.
Ccomplexity of the issue tracker itself does not directly imply
functional gain to the user.

here is a url to roundup ( that I should have, but forgot to, include in
my last email ) http://roundup.sourceforge.net/

Because we're not an official mirror, and will probably never be. We
don't mirror everything Ubuntu has got (in terms of architecture),
neither do we want to. Ubuntu does not accept such mirrors as
official.

We are, however, official for Debian, as you can see here:

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0710181529240.965-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

TECH TIP: Use Vim as a Chat Client
This tip comes from the book Hacking Vim by Kim Schulz:

Many IRC clients exist, and in 2004, the Japanese Vim user Madoka
Machitani started implementing an IRC client in Vim. He called the
client VimIRC, and what he constructed was a very feature-rich client
that supports chatting in multiple channels on multiple networks. You
can even use your normal Vim commands like I, /, ?, etc.

There is, however, a small problem when chatting from within Vim
(besides the fact that it takes time from your actual project). In
order for the chat to stay online, it has to create a loop that keeps
updating everything. When you move to another buffer that has nothing
to do with the IRC client, then this loop is stopped and you are
eventually disconnected from the network. So the trick to get this
chat client working optimally is to start it in a Gvim or Vim of its
own. This can be done directly on the command line with:

gvim -i NONE -i .vimircrc -c VimIRC where .vimircrc is the path to a Vim
configuration file with VimIRC-specific settings.

You can find the latest version of the VimIRC script at this
address:http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=931

Look in the top of the script for a thorough description of how to
install and configure it. You can chat with other Vim users if you use
the IRC network irc.freenode.net and join the channel #vim. See you
there!

This is an excerpt from the book Hacking Vim: A Cookbook to Get the
Most out of the Latest Vim Editor by Kim Schulz and published by Packt
Publishing; ISBN 978-1-847190-93-2. Reprinted with permission. For

I think there is no upper limit on the number of albums, but there is
a limit on the number of photos per album "Maximum 500 photos per

See the RX errors. It was 4 in your prv mail. Now it is 13. 
So I hope, the NIC is not supported in Linux. Check.

There will be a hardware address (MAC) associated with a NIC. For the
NIC to accept the packet, the packet should have its MAC address in
ethernet header. So the sender will try to findout the hardware
address of the destination IP using the ARP packet. Basically an ARP
packet will be asking the hardware address of the NIC which uses a
particular IP address.
So here, before sending the ping packet, srcd will send an ARP packet
to find out the MAC of 192.168.1.1 and ping packet will be sent only
if ARP is successfully replied by the destination. That is why I asked
you to dump the output of arp command.
But the output provided by you looks like it is before issuing the
ping command. If it is so, please issue a ping command and let it
fail, after that issue arp command to see whether ARP is resolved.

> and why u suggested not to use 192.168.1.3? because I booted that system

I thought windows is running on different machine. If so, an IP
conflict will occure which will result in inconsistent output.

By the way have you checked the cable? are you able to ping using the
same cable when booted on Windows?

If the ARP is not resolved and the cable you are using is perfectly
OK, then I think there is some problem with the NIC support in your
Linux.

Message-ID: <d5c9fe000710180625m67d98048tc9844f28f929b067@mail.gmail.com>

Guys,

I had an opportunity boot puppy linux today. Man it is damn fast. Any
application
is getting opened in second. I tried opening multiple apps like
Abiword, conosle, browser,
and some others, everything opened at the same speed. I think this a
potential Desktop
Linux. The interface is very simple and really attractive. Just give
it a shot sometimes, you might fall for this one.

siva.

(1) if you install netbeans or eclipse a pre-built apache tomcat comes with 
them... while running the application this apache tomcat can be used...

(2) This is old:

Is it using ext3 file system now? And is it still single user?
I am considering installing it on my cousin's PC. Earlier
I had installed the old one version. But, since I have
downloaded a new version I may as well install it. Just
need to know if it's worth installing the new version.

Hi,
  The latest and greatest version of Ubuntu has been

download.
http://www.ubuntu.com/

  I have been using the prerelease version of Gutsy

Guys.. thanks for your support..

take a look at this page..

http://gentoo-wiki.com/HARDWARE_RTL8168

In that old machine this is the NIC (RTL8169) I used and the windows did the
damage. I report this problem in srcd forum and Got this information link.

Finally I said to my friend "machan.. this time your machine escaped from
me... Let see after the next kernel release"

Thanks friends.. My first linux Network adventure is somewhat failed but I
learned a lot..

ps: (I wrote this mail from srcd, configured in that same windows network
but in another new machine).

Thanks,

Do you know if the Bluetooth problems are resolved especially bluez-pin/ 
bluepin, pin_helper, default passkey declaratives and registration of 
passkey-agent?

Feisty had btsco userspace tool but not the kernel module etc.

I've a Motorola HS805 and a Moto L6. Having a horrid time getting them 
to work with Feisty. Has anyone else had better luck? Looks like these 
worked in Dapper.

Sir,
     I also tried it.
      1. It is configured as single click operation.
      2. One more amazing thing,it is running pentium 100mhz Zenith PC. Only
problem is video card driver problem during installation not at as Live CD.
      3. It has inbuilt iso image editor.
      4. easy to use as rescue  CD. because of  easy network configuration,
Hard Disk access. It is also able to configure the rights
(read/write/execute)
      5. Main drawback is Installation in common

Please have a look at this article by Joel Spolsky
http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000052.html (Let Me Go back)

some Quotes:

"When you're trying to get people to switch from a competitor to your
product, you need to understand barriers to entry, and you need to
understand them a lot better than you think, or people won't switch
and you'll be waiting tables."

Microsoft products are dominant in the industry. When you try to
advocate someone to switch to the open source alternative, you should
give them an option to "Switch Back", in case they found out that
something did not work as they expect.

"The most important thing to do when you're in this position is to admit it."

If someone wants help with switching from MySQL to MS SQL and he gets
it from Open Source mailing list, he will be more inclined to
recommend/use open source software in future ('One can try and if it
does not work out, can always go back').

Yes, no one is obliged to help. But it is good for the open source
software community if someone gets this kind of help also.

best regards,

Ma Sivakumar

Sir,
    In my RHEL4 server, I wrongly configured DNS server name, primary server
name through GUI mode.
ie  Hat----> System settings ----> Networks

It is not necessary an  Server name. Hence i  deleted it in the same manner.
But during every time of startup httpd startup display the following error
message.
        httpd: could not determain the server's fully qualified domain name,
using 172.20.16.2 for server name.

I thought  that it is required to edit dns name config file. but not sure.
due to the above problem i could not open the webpage ofthis machine. please
help me.

I tried 'http://localhost/' this displays the Apache webserver welcome page.

Sorry, I am not exactly familiar with GUI tools in Red Hat but
you can change the DNS servers by editing the file
/etc/resolv.conf
Or just run the tool in system settings again and enter the
right DNS.

This is not related to your DNS error AFAIK.
Check the output of hostname and hostname -f commands
Your hostname hasn't been set properly.
I believe you will find this too in Networks or you can check
the file /etc/hosts.

more than being open source or proprietary, i think any tech enthusiast would be eager to help if he has the necessary knowledge. To me Open Source is more of a philosophy than mere shouting about it and going astray.

I like Windows but i prefer Ubuntu (though my FF also hangs sometimes) etc etc. Even if M$ has a problem and I am the only person on earth who knows the solution, then i wouldn't mind giving it away for free.

Upgraded to Gutsy from Feisty yesterday. Took a few ticks over 10 hrs
and thankfully my Internet connection and power held on.

Good Ones:
1. Bluetooth headset works out of the box now. Gnome BT manager is
umpteen times better than what it used to be.
2. Pidgin looks much better than GAIM and has out of the box Google Talk
support.
3. Nice themes and appearance controls.
4. Bluetooth protocol analyser.
5. Desktop Search.
6. Fonts are much better now.

Issues (very minor):
1. Only other issue was Thunderbird 1.5 to 2.0 did not migrate setting
and mail. Location changed from ~/.mozilla-thunderbird to
~/.thunderbird. Took a while to figure that out.
2. Virtualbox driver had to be recreated. Data intact.
3. Some desktop icon links were broken and had to be recreated.
4. Menu needs reorganisation if it were edited earlier. Broken links and 
wrong grouping for a few entries.

Still need to see if kmobiletools supports Moto L6 on BT.

Subject: [Ilugc] bluetooth Ubuntu - Moto L6
Message-ID: <4719B0D3.8080403@vsnl.com>

I've been using Moto Phone Tools in Win. Moved over to Ubuntu and one 
thing I'm not able to do is get kmobiletools to work with the phone on BT.

I've googled, RTFM, looked at Ubuntu wikis etc but still have not been 
able to move forward. Obexpush to mobile works. Cannot get serial modem 
link going.

So far:
1. hcitool scan and inq return the bdaadr.
2. sdptool browse shows DUN on channel 1.
3. I've bound rfcomm0 to the bdaddr channel 1.
4. hcitool cc bdaddr does not return anything but prompt.
5. hcitool con shows no connections.
6. hcitool auth bdaddr says not connected.

The Moto phone brings up a screen asking conf for connect even though it 
is set to always connect. The screen pops up and goes away immediately 
not allowing me to hit the confirm key.

I was struggling with a headset similarly but 7.10 had out of the box 
support for headsets.

Has anyone waded thro' this before?

Sorry, please check with google or m$. This is not the correct place
to ask. You can do this in many ways (converting to csv and dumping to
m$sql) or use third party tools as mentioned by others or write a
program on your prefered language that supports both the dbs to do the
convertion.

Wish it did. I do not seem to have permissions on std dev entry. But I 
reckon distros come with proper permissions thus msg may mean something 
else.

root@smohan-laptop:/home/smohan# rfcomm
rfcomm0: 00:17:84:85:5C:1E channel 1 clean
root@smohan-laptop:/home/smohan# rfcomm connect rfcomm0 00:17:84:85:5C:1E
Can't connect RFCOMM socket: Permission denied
root@smohan-laptop:/home/smohan#

Newer docs do not talk of pin_helpers (declared in hcid.conf). I found a 
place where a guy had installed his own script to echo "PIN:abcd" for 
giving a fixed PIN. Did that too. No avail.

Newest kmobiletools 0.5 does a search thro' all rfcomms for a DUN 
connection. My phone does pop up a screen that vanishes immediately. 
Wonder if these guys tweaked firmware to respond to MPT only. Can never say.

I'm getting stuck on the PIN exchange.

<quote>
When connecting the two devices for the first time you might be asked to 
enter a PIN-Code on the phone. Enter some numbers and press 'Okay' 
rfcomm will ask you to enter the PIN-Code for the mobile phone. Enter 
the same numbers and press <Enter>/Click Okay. Both devices will now 
connect to each other.
</quote>

Does not happen for me. Pin_helpers are supposed to provide the pins. In 
feisty, passkey agents had to be manually invoked prior to connection in 
an open shell. Then the dialog stated above happens. pin_helpers 
declared in hcid.conf did not work. In Gutsy (BlueZ 3.0 upwards), all 
pin_helpers are deprecated. Positively frustrating.

Hi all,
I tried installing  yesterday. It started off alright. But during base installation itself it started that this package is corrupt, that package is corrupt, not downloaded. It gave up after some time saying installation stopped. I think it is media problem. But before installation I ran media check, but it reported no problem. Has anybody faced similar probs with LFY DVD's?

Hi All,

Before the debate began, four student pranksters dressed in ninja garb
jumped in front of Stallman as he prepared to
 take the stage. After posing for pictures with him, they ran out of the

depicting a failed assassination attempt on Stallman by four masked men from

Dear Ilugies

Due to certain operational difficulties I am forced to run  an email
server using a dial-up connection. Does anybody have any prior
experience in running such a setup. I am planning to use ubuntu 7.04
server edition. Are there any particular points I have to take into
account while planning this email server

1. Setup dynamic dns for your domain
2. Set your mailserver to "smarthost" through the ddns provider's server or
through your cable / dsl ISP's smtp server. Don't try to deliver email
directly out through your server, most ISPs wont accept such email.

I have run an email server for about 4 years on dialup - and dialin.  
The key thing is balancing mails to be sent and frequency of dialing  
up. I had two modems for dialin and one for dialup. And perl scripts  
to check when there is enough pending mail to justify a dial. The  
other problem is duplicate mails - you will be using fetchmail, and  
if the dialup quits, you get duplicates dowloaded. You need perl/ 
mysql db to look after this. I had great fun doing this - and I  
suggest you use perl and mysql for finetuning - nothing like using  
antique tools to handle antique situations.

Fetchmail is great fun to use - I suggest also to make extensive use  
of procmail recipies. The greatest tool to learn linux admin is  
running a dialup mailserver.

I feel one project should essentially be on setting up and maintaining a 
website using the L.A.M.P. solution stack. Basic as it may seem to experts, 
I find many Web developers are not comfortable with that yet.

More ideas,

* An exercise of installing a working insallation of GNU/Linux with a
specific user setup and permissions. There can be more than one distro
used such that it will give more exposure to various distros present.
* Setting up of a mail server, proxy server, Samba server
* Remote access of machines through ssh and use of tools like scp
* Setting up SCM like svn repository and create, manage a repository
* Setting up of Apache server for a virtual host setup, along with
mysql and php5
* Building and Installing from source, with a custom configuration
* Example program(s) in one of the scripting language (Bash, Perl or
Python)

more ideas,

instead of creating an application from scratch, we could ask the student to
study the exisitng open source System like CMS, supply chain management,
smilarly many more open source e-commerce applications. like Drupal, Joomla,
XOOPS, Docebo, OS commerce, Trac, bugzilla, many more applications.

this could help them to study the exisiting implementation,  customizing  it
  & contributing back the community. this will spread the awareness &
exposure of the open source Products.

please a kind request never ask to student to do a project . ask them to
come out with an innovative product that help one another.

Adding to this and my earlier suggestion... another practical problem I've 
seen is when a developer is asked to 'fix' or 'add to' an existing L.A.M.P. 
setup! So, yes, why not get them to tweak an exisitng system -- to some, 
this is more difficult to do than create a new website (which I've seen some 
people do by copy-pasting code!)

Cheers!

yes, i agree with you , but here the my objective is to give a student to
explorer much about open source system. i apreciate student copying the
code. their is no harm in copying exisiting with crystal  clear
understanding. as same idea as in open book test.

show the code ask them how to write in more efficient way...

I was doing this too for a long while. Duplicate mails were not an issue 
as my dialup was stable. In fetchmail, to minimise duplicates, you can 
expunge using the -e option every x msgs thus limiting duplicates. I 
have not used it but I'm guessing the -b option probably send a quit 
flushing retrieved msgs.

You'll also need to set up a catch-all email bag for your domain at your 
ISP and pop it using fetchmail in multidrop mode. Make sure the bag is 
big enough to avoid bounces. Function of expected mail sizes, frequency 
of arrival and frequency of pickup. No set rule. If you get to use Gmail 
for domains, then probably this will not be an issue.

Config requirements have come in various mails.

Not a howto but a brief scheme:
1. Test you PPP connection. Try to establish a connection every 5 mins 
and drop it after a minute.
2. Once this is done, try invoking sendmail -q (dequeuing sendmail smtp 
msgs to smarthost) on the ifup of the PPP connection.
3. Modify this to drop the connection once sendmail -q returns success.
4. Add fetchmail pick up to this loop.
5. Schedule this using cron with controls of outgoing queue size and 
also check if an earlier instance is running.

Hi,

Suddenly something glowed in my mind. I hope there is FOSS Elective (I
or II) offered in this College ? Then we need to have a practical
stuff which corresponds directly to their theoretical curriculum so
that they can utilize this lab to practice what they learn in their
theories. This is very helpful in understanding the theoretical part.

We should be careful to choose the experiments and level of it, as
throwing things which they do not have a theoretical background will
not help in making them grasp things. Rather the lab should be an
opportunity for them to explore what they have read in their books.
This is at least necessary for first few batches as it will give them
a start as what to expect and what to do. Also, we can also know what
is their grasping level and interests, alter the curriculum according
to it.

Just my additional 2 cents :)

Is using sendmail a better option because i am more conversant with
sendmail settings than postfix. I did not see any option for
smarthosting in the sendmail for ubuntu.

Areas normally missed out apart from those listed:
1. Basic TCP/IP networking, routing, filtering etc. One exercise should 
be set up 3/4 small LANs, route and filter traffic between them.
2. Definitely LAMP - in a secure fashion using iptables, apache config 
and directives.
3. I believe many colleges do not have machines where OS installations 
can be tried out. A separate set of machines dedicated for this practice 
helps. Can be yesteryear h/w condemned from M$ labs.
4. Eclipse IDE to move away from M$ Visual Series.
5. Create familiarity with the FOSS ecosystem, do reading seminars with 
papers from RMS, ESR, Bruce Perens etc, discuss licencing options, 
repurcussions, Forum usage/etiquette, personal progression and 
navigation in a collaborative FOSS community etc.
6. Use of good scripting tools/languages for testing Tcl/Tk, Expect etc.
7. Doc tools like Latex, Docbook etc.
8. A course on discussions and practice of FOSS alternatives for popular 
commercial options, migration, compatibility etc.

Postfix uses sendmail config files (postfix is a drop-in replacement for 
sendmail). SMARTHOST is defined in the sendmail.mc file. You'll get a 
lot of stuff on it on the Net.

Use define(`SMART_HOST',`your.smtp.server') in the mc file.

Slightly more complex than that if you want better performance

Replying to my own post as I finally got my stuff to work. Not very 
scientific as it was a trial and error method. Will try to give a 
sequence which I think works. If someone else can check it out, it would 
be great.  *Warning: Long post*

Preamble:
A lot of changes have happened in the BlueZ utils recently. Bluetooth 
was broken in Feisty and Edgy as per ML. Feisty has btsco user space s/w 
for headsets but no kernel module btsco.

My experience:
*Headset HS805:*
1. When I shifted to Gutsy, the first thing I noticed was direct headset 
support. System >> Preferences >> Bluetooth headset.
2. My Moto HS805 worked first shot in pairing. Subsequent connections 
took some learning.  Invoking the BT headset and check for new devices 
shows the headset when headset is in pairing mode and the HS button was 
clicked a couple of times. No pairing beeps as I would hear if it paired 
with my Moto L6.
3. Once it appeared on the list, choosing it as the active headset made 
it the second ALSA and OSS device.
4. Once done, I was able to pick the BT headset in Skype sound devices.

       Happy, thrilled and felt something was accomplished fairly fast.

*Moto L6:* Wanted to use Wammu/Kmobiletools for phonebook/ SMS etc.
1. When I installed Gutsy, I also installed the kobexclient. 
Gnome-obex-server came in the gnome-bluez utils pack and got installed.
2. I set the laptop to automatic connect on my MotoL6. Obex push from PC 
  worked well. Invoked gnome-obex-server on PC and obex push from phone 
worked well.
3. I setup rfcomm to bind to the address and l2ping worked well. "rfcomm 
connect 0" refused to connect. /dev/rfcomm0 had 600 as rights and I was 
root. As I'd read someplace, I set the permissions to 666. Still pairing 
did not happen.
4. /var/log/syslog showed passkey-agent registered. I set default to 
0000 and still no avail. I wrote a pin_helper script that  echoed 
"PIN:0000" and called it from /etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf. Still no avail.
5. Did some more RTFM and read in blueZ architecture that auth uses the 
dbus architecture and a interactive dbus-send command was listed. I used 
that to send a PIN to the device and it paired.
6. Went to the bluetooth paired devices config and set both the headset 
and phone as trusted devices.
7. Tried rfcomm connect 0 and it worked. Fired up cutecom and tried AT+C 
commands. Disconnected. Moved down from 115200 to 19200 bauds and they 
worked.
8. Wammu and Kmobiletools were a breeze after this.

Hope this is useful to others. Most documents I read did not deal with 
the PIN auth problem solution that I tried. Most list pin_helpers which 
were deprecated in blueZ 3.0.

Forgot to mention some important stuff here:
1. What I did was to create a bond. This is called by the service which 
leads to PIN exchange. Since the PIN exchange was not happening, I was 
forced to go lower and create the bond myself. This is a one time 
exercise per device.
2. URL http://wiki.bluez.org/wiki/HOWTO/Bonding
3. command used: dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply 
--dest=org.bluez /org/bluez/hci0 org.bluez.Adapter.CreateBonding 
string:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF

This caused the PIN box to pop up on the PC. Once keyed in, the MotoL6 
asked for the same key. This was timing out pretty fast. I had to do a 
one hand per device act to beat the clock. Got it after a few tries.

if you *must* torture yourself - add a line for smarhost in

Right now i am running a fc6 server box where sendmail looks after
sending mail while i use fetchmail for downloading the mails from my
email service provider's server. Can the same behaviour be repeated
with the combination of postfix+fetchmail

yes - default install of postfix plus a line on smarthost will do the  
trick - aswill default install of fetcmail

Dovecot is an imap server. Fetchmail is a (badly broken and now insecure, at
least the original ESR version) imap / pop client.

If you want a replacement for fetchmail try getmail, or try

Agree. I'd assumed he did not have that option to define and manage 
umpteen mail ids on the ISP server. Definitely having individual a/cs on 
the ISP server for every a/c receiving mail from the Internet is 
desirable. Controlling bag size per a/c is a key factor in preferring this.

I can create any number of email ids I want in my email service
provider's server. I am right now being forced to use dial-up because
BSNL is refusing to give a dataone connection giving some stupid
reason that they are having some technical fault.

Here, i want to add that, apache2 is running. I ran /etc/init.d/apache2

This is happening because your server's fully qualified domain
name isn't being resolved.
In case you aren't sure of what fully qualified domain name is

Then if your provider offers smtp authentication, let your users set their
outlook express up to send through the provider's mailserver. Or set your
local sendmail, postfix etc to smarthost through the provider's mailserver.

The actual server has been setup. Now the only thing I have to check
up is whether it works on dial-up connection

even services which give limited no of IDs usually give unlimited  
aliases - so the more important people get IDs and the rest get aliases

these are just warnings - the first means that you have installed php  
twice and the second shows that you dont have a name (like zico.web)  
for your machine. They wont create 404 error

Hi,

One experiment should be there to explore/learn atleast basic set of
functionalities of  vi / emacs(any editor, no gedit/kedit please) as this is
base for editing any file and is very much essential. Can be the first
experiment as it will be simple.

Can include awk / sed also and some simple excercises on regex(they learn
regex in Theory of Computation without any practical exposure)

I have its variant (SC420 & SC430) running with CentOS 4.x for 2 years

Message-ID: <9d3184460710230534q3c9fc87bw851c1e98bd1cdbc2@mail.gmail.com>

hello luggies,


I am trying to install Fedora core 7, from this afternoon.  but mechine is
behaving strangely.
this is  my system configuration.

Intel pentium D core
Gigabyte 950 series
512 DDR2 Ram
80 GB SATA

I completed installing . the mechine reboots,  X server started. Systems
boots into first boot screen & it hangs up no
response. i never seen linux mechine hung before.

Here the worst case is, i was demonstrating the linux installation to the
window users.

what could be done now?  how could i proceed from here.


cheers

I had 4 DELL servers with RAID controllers running Redhat for 3 years. 
Did not have any issues. Servers have very few driver issues as devices 
are Intel/ Adaptec etc which are normally supported by all distros.

That should be just Fedora 7 (core and extras repository has been merged 
for this release)

Neither the keyboard nor mouse works?  What display card and monitor is 
this? Have you tried booting into runlevel 3?

I hope, it is video driver issue. Boot the machine in init 3 level.
Start the X thru startx command and debug the problem.

Is F7 provide option to select init 3 during the installation itself?

IMO this kind of advocacy is in bad taste. In a number of such 
instances, instead of attempting to troubleshoot a problem which 
includes hardware issues, people tend to use that as a opportunity to 
pimp up their favorite thing. Distro hopping doesn't grow the base for 
Linux.

Unplug and re-plug your keyboard, change it to a different usb port if usb,

        Actually, the advice to have a live cd around (of whatever
 distribution you want) is a good one -- whether or not you want to
 never install the distro the live cd is built around.

        The idea is to rapidly rule out hardware issues -- if it works
 with the live cd, you know that the problem is in software
 configuration.

        You should not get so thin skinned about your favorite
 distribution that you start attacking people  offering diagnostic help.

Always use $insert_favorite_distro would be inappropriate here. Just 
advising people to use a live cd would indeed be good idea.

I don't believe the point here was use of live cd but the nature of 
advocacy in LUG's which tend to revolve around specific distributions 
rather than promoting Free software.

Ok...the funny thing is, there is no docroot or DocumentRoot in my apache2
directory. But, what i  got from /etc/apache2/sites-available/default  is:

 DocumentRoot /var/www/
        <Directory />
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride all

:)

if you *do* carry a livecd, it should be knoppix - which will help  
you get the proper hardware settings in case the distro of your  
choice does not detect the hardware properly.

I didn`t set anything. Even i didn`t touch the configuration file. It did it
by itself.
And there is *no* htdocs in /var/www/ directory.
htdocs is in /etc/apache2/htdocs/

My personal opinion is that when one joins a community, one abides by  
the rules of the community. If one does not agree with the rules,  
there are only two choices:

1. abide by them and work to get them changed
2. leave and start your own community

Civil disobedience is not an option, because joining the community is  
a voluntary act.

Top posting is something most of us do (and hell, in a work context it is
something I do all the time, it just works easier - especially when the rest
of the people in the thread all top post). And you can read the entire reply
right at the top instead of having to scroll down through a lot of context.

Seen the mess a really long thread can get into, with quotes from multiple
different people?  Try some long threads on usenet and see what they look
like, especially when some are using quotes, others pipes, still others
gnus/emacs' supercite mode name> for quotes ..

That prohibition basically started out back when everybody was on string and
tincan modem connections, slow uucp links etc.  Not really "applicable" now.

Go after people who send one liners in sms-speak, with my blessings. This
objection to top posting is an anachronism, though.

        Without context, it is mostly meaningless drivel.  It might work
 for people who rare,y deal with email, and either retain the context,
 or do not mind reading from bottom to the top.  I, for one, usually
 just skip top posters.

        Which is why one trims.

        Sure it is.  Lots of knowledgeable people will not respond to
 the rudeness implied in top posting; and thus the top poster will miss
 out on any help they could have offered.

for the purpose of this argument, posts can be divided into two  
categories - archived lists and unarchived posts. In the case of  
unarchived posts, say between 4 or 5 people, one *should* top post  
and not trim content, so everyone can see the context. In such a  
situation, interleaved posting and trimming posts soon leads to an  
unreadable mess.

in the case of *archived* lists, the context is always available in  
the archive, threads are clearly available in the archives, hence  
only enough content to make sense should be retained. Imagine a  
thread of 50 messages, all top posted. The result will be:

message no 1 will be archived 50 times
message no 2 will be archived 49 times
message no 3 will be archived 48 times
I leave the computation of how many times the remaining messages are  
archived and how much duplicate matter is stored to the reader.

this goes against the fundamental principle of DRY, pollutes  
cyberspace with junk and goes against common sense.

you are free to launch a campaign to change the rule - but until it

Which is worst? top posting or discussing the things out of topic? I
fear in future some body struggling with installing Fedora and wanted
help will come across this post. I can't imagine what he will think
after reading about top posting :)

        I think discussions of rules of conduct of the mailing list
 _are_ on topic. Without concepts of decorum, and nettiquette, online
 discourse rapidly descends into chaos.

        So, a newbie looking for help ought to realize this that this
 not just a unpaid help desk, but a community of people -- and with any
 community, rules of decorum need be followed.

        The context to which I am replying is preserved in my reply --
 without resorting to top posting, and even with trimming. Even
 if this list were not archived, the posts are not so far apart as to
 require re-sending the entire thread for every response.

        Top posting merely scrambles the dialogue, and makes it hared to
 discern exactly which point was being responded to.

Not a campaign as much as trying to police the list.  And ilugc is a tiny
list, by most standards - and not all that much traffic in a day, certainly
not lkml level. You'd barely strain a 486 running some variety of barebones
linux and a webserver .. 

But the merits or demerits of top posting aside, those are for the admin to
enforce. Or not. As he pleases. Last I checked, Prof Sriram is the list
admin, not you, not me.

So, if you want to tell someone not to top post, do so. But answer his
question at the same time.

no, no and no again. This is *not* a moderated list - it depends on  
peer pressure. And Prof Sriram has many better things to do than  
educate newbies on the niceties of etiquette. Unless you want to  
outsource admin to a person who would delight in doing this?

I moved out of Bangalore 7 years back, haven't felt the need to live there
since then. So I will probably take a raincheck.

An admin liking or not liking his job isn't really the issue.  The issue is
where he likes it too much for his own, or the list's good.  

I admin a list myself (ilug Hyderabad), but well.. peer pressure has its
limits, and I am someone who looks at the content of a post rather than
whether it is top posted, full quoted, bottom posted, etc etc.

Now I am bottom posting. But Still I don't care about trimming the 
unwanted text before sending it to list. Just scroll down and see how 
much unwanted text added. This is also NOT good.

Is it still that you need to learn about quoting or is it something
wrong with the mail client ? ;)

Please check before you press the send, whether you have quoted
correctly and chopped off unwanted parts (esp, the signature part in
the mails) :)

I have noticed hanging of keyboard+mouse some times when X starts in
redhat based distro. Please check if keyboard works fine in single
user mode. If it works post the following details to debug

1.Details of mouse,video card chipset, monitor details
2.post xorg.conf file
3.If possible look at xorg log in /var/log and post the errors

This happened to me with ubuntu dapper some time back. Disabling usb
keyboard in the bios solved the problem.

I love slax liveCDs.

http://www.slax.org

Site is down right now but it usually works...

There are 50 MB downloads that do a great job.

Even the gentoo install CD is pretty good at hardware detection and that
itself is a liveCD.

Hi there,

I've got some doubts in the /usr/include/ folder. there some subfolders 
like the following,

arpa
asm
attr
bits
c++
curl
et
gdbm
linux
ncurses
net
netash
netinet
netpacket
openssl
pppd
protocols
rpc
sys

when i want to learn about these folders and the libraries available in 
those folders i couldn't find any information, or i couldn't infer any 
details from the files in those folders.
albeit i could find some in the internet, also being a programmer i can 
get some like c++, net, inet ( by using some libraries ) in my coding.
But i need a clear specifications of these folders like
-    what corresponds to these folders
-    what are include files available in these folders, and
-    what these files provide

Also, the include files in this folders couldn't provide the information 
what i need. All the header files starts with the Copyrights, 
Redistribution and warranty. Then they directly comment about each 
functions and variables available, instead of giving a brief 
introduction about that header file in whole.

Where can i find these information, about these folders and header 
files, to have an indepth knowledge of the libraries available in the 
include folder.

Please help me in this. I've started exploring linux only now, after 
getting interest in it.

Most mail readers are set by default to top post.
Extra effort is required to bottom post and delete
footers,etc.
People in their enthusiasm(hurry?) to give their 2c
might not bother.

And they might even forget about that other mailing list sin - fullquoting
and bottom posting, that is quoting a 25..30 line mail and adding two lines
of reply under it so people have to scroll all the way down for the reply.

we dont need people who wont take extra effort to be polite and  
helpful. When I was in Mumbai, I was amazed to see people Queueing up  
for buses. Unlike in Chennai where there is a mad rush for the bus.  
The Mumbai people take 'extra effort' to Queue up - please go to  
Mumbai and teach them Chennai ways - if you, in your enthusiasm 
(hurry?) want to get on the bus, why worry about Queue?

        As a professional, are we not supposed to know our tools? And
 in this day and age, isn't MUA illiteracy not something to be pandered
 to?  Should the right anser now be that one uses a better MUA, or, at
 least, one sets up the tool of choice to adhere to nettiquette?

        Or are people no longer aware of nettiquette, and so do not know
 they are coming across as boors?

        Woah. There is no context in this message at all -- and no
 reference headers, so I can't readily get back to the actual problem
 you are having.   I even went back and looked at the last 300 messages
 in the list (thanks, gmane), but could not readily discern which was
 the parent posting.

Find out the pacakge, the header file came from. To find the package  use the
following command.

Debian: dpkg -S /usr/include/your/header.h
Fedora: rpm -q --whatprovides /usr/include/your/header.h

The package description should give you some information about the header files.
To get the package description use the following command.

Debian: dpkg --print-avail my-package-name
Fedora: rpm -qi my-package-name

To check if there is any associated documentation files

Debian: dpkg --listfiles my-package-name
Fedora: rpm -ql my-package-name

Hope this helps.

Regards,
Vijay

        Boot with a liveCD. Mount the root directory on /mnt. Clear out
 the password field in /mnt/etc/shadow. Reboot into the machine. Log in
 as root, and set the password.

hi all: I hope you understand that the request was for a set of experiments
-- means the students will have a lab course during one semester and there
will be an EXAMINATION at the end.

w.r.to Parthan's query, Arunai is not offering FOSS Elective, but his
suggestion to provide FOSS Elective I (and a bit of Elective II) oriented
exercises for the FOSS lab should boost the chance of elective.

one should avoid repetition of experiments already done -- the students have
an OS lab, mostly done using Linux but providing very minimal exposure.

a list sent to Prof Chellatamilan is available in the following link:

If you have physical access to the system,try booting it in the single
mode, (from grub, append single to the kernel line), it automatically
logs in as the root.

hi,

In recent threads there have been complaints from members that  
posting according to list guidelines is difficult and time consuming.  
Although this problem has been addressed umpteen times on the net,  
once more wont hurt anyone. So here goes:

step one: read the post

step two: check whether anyone else has answered the post. Use  
threads in your mail client to be able to check this

step three: with your mouse, highlight the paragraphs that you want  
to respond to

step four: press reply - you will find the paragraphs you want to  
quote are displayed in the message and all other matter has been trimmed

step five: move below each paragraph you want to reply to and press  
enter to create a blank line. THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE A BLANK LINE  
BETWEEN QUOTED MATERIAL AND YOUR REPLY.

step six: type in your reply after each of the quoted paragrapns

step seven: reread everything to see if there is still material to be  
trimmed

step eight: click on send

Just pulling your leg. :)

But it seems that discussions on how to carry out discussions take up
more space than the actual discussion themselves.  Not taking sides,
just making an observation.

A friend of mine recently commented that he didn't want to join the

Not playing list police, and not taking up too much time in meta threads
like this does help improve SNR.

Like I said - Dr.Sreeram is free to appoint someone (say Bharati) to do the
"actual" admining of the list, and he can strive to keep discussions on
topic, as well as unsubscribe (say) people sending social networking emails,
recruitment and body shopping posts completely unrelated to linux etc.
Egregious violations.

Wasting everybody's time chasing after top posters and sms speakers is just
not on.

        Sure. You have to decide on the mechanics and policies before
 you can get on to serious work.

        Incidentally, even the people who are "taking sides" are just
 making observations, in a sense.  This pretending to hide behind the
 guise of an "observer" merely makes people take your statements with
 less gravity, and does nothing to reduce discussion.  It just makes it
 sound like you do not want to stand behind your own statements.

        Only on the surface. If the content of the list degenerates into
 hard to read posts, and postings that come across as rude because they
 do not observe common nettiquette, then the signal will also
 drop. Better to get it fixed before we lose the quality of the list.

        It is better if _someone_ does play list police; ideally
 off-list, to get the message across, and yet not clutter up the list.

        The solution is to take the gentle reminder off-list, not throw
 the baby out with the bath water by letting the list degenerate.

        Umm. This is not how most mailing lists and USENET groups
 work -- they are governed by the charter, and by people sharing the
 burden of meeting the charter. The people who created the mailing list
 or group does not become a de-facto or de-jure god.

        Are you suggesting we just silently ignore top posters and
 people who do not know how to ask questions smartly[0]? I will
 reluctantly do that, if the people on the mailing list are so resistant
 to nettiquette. Presumably the signal will not drop because of this.

Hi,

        I have been asked to provide details. Ok,  here goes:

a) try booting into single user mode. On my machine, it seems to still
   ask for the root password, so that solution, proposed by others, does
   not work for me. However, since it works for them, you might get
   lucky. 
b) As an ordinary user, run dh, look for where root is mounted. In my
   case, it is /dev/sdb2
   Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
   /dev/sdb2             16126420    688952  14618156   5% /
c) Boot into a live CD (Knoppix, morphix, Ubuntu, whatever)
d) Get a root shell (depends on your live cd; (knoppix has a menu on the
   bottom left that allows you to create a terminal window logged in as
   root) 
e) Check to see if your live cd has helpfully mounted your root
   partition for you, read-only
   # mount
   /dev/sdb2 on / type ext3 (ro,noatime,errors=remount-ro)

f) Mount your old root partition under /mnt. If it is already mounted
   for you, mount it read-write.
   mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt

    or 

   mount -o remount,rw /mnt/sdb2 (or wherever knoppix mounted things
   read only)

g) Go edit /mnt/etc/shadow

I have seen examples of aggressive + offlist list moderation .. the blug
lists, and then nanog (www.nanog.org), which was run for years by Susan
Harris from merit.edu, the org that operates nanog .. her policies caused a
near universal revolt, a special session at a nanog meeting and then the
formation of what was basically a mailing list committee chosen / elected by
the community.

And nanog typically has senior systems / network admins at tier 1s all the
way to small offices with a T1, rather than students sending sms-speak
email, so the challenge is more preventing topic drift than anything else.

By the way, nobody on nanog seems to bother flaming top / bottom posts,
posts in html, etc .. the prohibitions against that are a legacy of usenet,
and then of various *nix / geek type mailing lists. You grow out of trying
to enforce it on everybody, at least once you get to looking at the post's
content and topicity instead

Like I said - usenet is a special case all by itself (and if you see the
other usenet groups around, not the comp.*, prog.* groups I mean.. even that
gets modified a bit). 

As for "most" mailing lists - especially the large ones that aren't totally
geek oriented, they get a totally different set of priorities.  You stop
trying to enforce posting styles, to start with ..

If you don't wish to answer a question on a mailing list, you are completely
free not to. Whether it is because you think your clue levels (admittedly
high clue levels) will be wasted on the guy because he top posts and appears
to have failed his sixth standard english exams, or because you don't agree
with him, or because he hasn't bothered to google even when the first link
would have brought him to the answer .. 

It is a free country. Personally speaking, I would try to answer it. If at
all I can read the email and if I have the time to answer it / like the
question (I can't read tamil so that percentage of ilug* posts is more or
less a closed book for me)

        It is not merely a matter of preference.  English is a lanbguage
 read from top to bottom. Putting later responses on top causes readers
 to have to revert the natural flow of reading the response, and makes
 it harder to follow the discussion; as does untrimmed useless clutter.

        I have a limited amount of time to follow lists, looking
 for people who might have issues with software that I can help with
 (usually Debian, but also SELinux and common UNIX issues).  Evolving
 the list culture so that the posts are mostly in logical order (answers
 coming _after_ the question , not before), with extraneous matter
 trimmed, would help everyone -- including other users who are trying to
 follow the conversation.

I agree with you so far. Where I disagree is on the productivity of actually
trying to enforce personal preferences on others who don't care a shit about
top, bottom, sideways etc posting .. they need help.  

If they get it, great. If they don't - well, they'll call a friend, ask on
another list, etc. Or dig around on google some more. Or maybe just wait
till someone replies.

        If one cares about having them get help, though, we should steer
 them towards practices that actually enhance the possibility of them
 actually getting answers.  This means everything that is in the asking
 smart questions essay.

        So think fof this not as policing, but gentle reminders how to
 maximize their probability of getting answers, reminding thewm that
 such behaviour comes across as boorish -- they are making extra work
 for people from whom they need help.

        In any forum, even face to face, you do not step up to a person,
 slap them on the cheek, and demand they help you. Such rudeness will
 not be tolerated in any civilized community.  What is so wrong in
 expecting a modicum of etiquette (which is what netiquette is all
 about) on a mailing list?

Hi!

My two cents...

You do tell people right when they join the list that these are the
etiquette rules expected out of the mailing list. Even a monthly
reminder is sent about the rules which are expected from the members.
If they still don't follow the rules, it only means, as srs says, that
they don't give a damn about it. I think we should go ahead and reply
to those who do follow the general principles, rather than allocating
list traffic to educate such people. Well, as was said earlier in this
thread, if you are *really* care about the person who has "offended",
post him an personal message, as the message you would be conveying is
anyway supposed to be known by most in the list (and there's a monthly
reminder in place as well). On the lighter side, I think the offender
is more likely to correct himself/herself if he is flooded with
individual mails rather than those sent to the group ;)

it moves on...

On a personal note, I love the flaming that goes on when someone steps
on the "holy grail" of list etiquette (especially replies from kg ;)
). Provide quite a bit of entertainment when you have free time ;)

it moves on...

ask him to join and raise the ratio - or is he the type who needs  
everything to be served to him on a platter?

typical Indian copout - if someone spits in the elevator, dont scowl  
at him, and if anyone else scowls at him yell at them. And file a PIL  
to demand that the government put a policeman in every elevator in  
the state to prevent people from spitting there. This is feudal  
thinking - we need someone to police us. I personaly am quite  
confident that due to this thread, the SNR ratio of the list will  
improve and more and more people will abide by list etiquette.

I hope, the list in the file is more then enough. Only
I like to add some exp to Understanding the GCC options
and writing small Makefile, which covers most of the BASIC
options.

Next is, we need to identify the list of expr for each
point, that will help students to understand the concept.

Please note that the students have an OS Lab in the 4th semester contents of
which are given below. hence we should take care not to replicate it.
Srinivasan.
------------
OS Lab :(Implement the following on LINUX platform. Use C for high level
language implementation)

1.             Shell programming

- command syntax                    - write simple functions               -
basic tests

2.             Shell programming

- loops            - patterns                 - expansions            -
substitutions

3.             Write programs using the following system calls of UNIX
operating system:

                fork, exec, getpid, exit, wait, close, stat, opendir,
readdir

4.             Write programs using the I/O system calls of UNIX operating
system (open, read, write, etc)

5.             Write C programs to simulate UNIX commands like ls, grep,
etc.

6.             Given the list of processes, their CPU burst times and
arrival times, display/print the Gantt chart for FCFS and SJF. For each of
the scheduling policies, compute and print the average waiting time and
average turnaround time

7.             Given the list of processes, their CPU burst times and
arrival times, display/print the Gantt chart for Priority and Round robin.
For each of the scheduling policies, compute and print the average waiting
time and average turnaround time

8.                 Implement the Producer ? Consumer problem using
semaphores.

9.                 Implement some memory management schemes ? I

10.                Implement some memory management schemes ? II



Example for expt 9 & 10 :

Free space is maintained as a linked list of nodes with each node having the
starting byte address and the ending byte address of a free block. Each
memory request consists of the process-id and the amount of storage space
required in bytes. Allocated memory space is again maintained as a linked
list of nodes with each node having the process-id, starting byte address
and the ending byte address of the allocated space.



When a process finishes (taken as input) the appropriate node from the
allocated list should be deleted and this free disk space should be added to
the free space list. [Care should be taken to merge contiguous free blocks
into one single block. This results in deleting more than one node from the
free space list and changing the start and end address in the appropriate
node]. For allocation use first fit, worst fit and best fit.

If you have livecd with you, you could use that. Open a terminal from
the livecd and as root issue the following..

# grub-install /dev/<insert_your_harddisk_node>

Subject: [Ilugc] Re: how to recover root password
Hi,
I have been asked to provide details. Ok, here goes:
a) try booting into single user mode. On my machine, it seems to still
ask for the root password, so that solution, proposed by others, does
not work for me. However, since it works for them, you might get
lucky. 
b) As an ordinary user, run dh, look for where root is mounted. In my
case, it is /dev/sdb2
Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sdb2 16126420 688952 14618156 5% /
c) Boot into a live CD (Knoppix, morphix, Ubuntu, whatever)
d) Get a root shell (depends on your live cd; (knoppix has a menu on the
bottom left that allows you to create a terminal window logged in as
root) 
e) Check to see if your live cd has helpfully mounted your root
partition for you, read-only
# mount
/dev/sdb2 on / type ext3 (ro,noatime,errors=remount-ro)
f) Mount your old root partition under /mnt. If it is already mounted
for you, mount it read-write.
mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt
or 
mount -o remount,rw /mnt/sdb2 (or wherever knoppix mounted things
read only)
g) Go edit /mnt/etc/shadow

Hi,

 Grab the CD which you used to install the fc4
 boot from CD and in the prompt type 
     linux rescue
 Go through the screens till the screen says it has mounted the system
under /mnt/sysimage

 It will give you a shell
 type 
 # chroot /mnt/sysimage
 
 You will get the prompt back 
 From this prompt issue the command 
 # grub-install /dev/hdX

 replace X with the drive which is supposed to have grub on MBR
 you have now re-installed grub

A name with a better recall value would be nice - FossConf 08? Rather 
simplistic shortening, but I don't see it being claimed by other 
conferences.

Are you sure the linux partitions are intact after you reinstalled Win XP?
Am asking because (I think) Win XP by default tries to occupy the whole
disk!

A generic name would be better which can be used over the years since
(I think) this is not going to be a one-off conference

a ruby subconference, and we can also have a python vs ruby flamefest

Oh noes, you make me out to be a total Ruby fanboy ;-). Sure it's a 
sweet language, but I also mess with others like Lisp and Erlang just to 
keep perspective. Actually, there's an introductory Erlang talk by me in 
the Chennai.rb meetup today.

I have nothing against Python, and probably would suck at the flamefest, 
coz I just don't know Python that well. Perhaps somebody who did both 
for a while would be better qualified :). But yes, a Ruby sub-conf 
sounds nice, because there are already a considerable number of local 
companies working on it, and I believe there will be a good turnout.

Acer sells laptops loaded with something called
'linux' which is an insult to linux as we know it.
But then you don't have to pay the Microsoft tax.

Dell 1420N laptop comes loaded with Ubuntu but I don't
think it has been released in India.
 
Low end nvidia and intel chipset systems will run
compiz if there is enough memory,ati chipset systems
may do it in near future.

TPD.

Sure. And get someone who is really really good at lisp (Karra Sriram I

Subject: [Ilugc] A short networking tutorial
Message-ID: <20071027145518.GA620@saraswathy.susmita.org>

Hello all,

I had a very interesting experience last night.

I went to an upcoming business quite obviously with a massive investment
but they did not take care to ensure that their systems administrator
was competitive.

It is laughable that someone who shells out crores and crores of rupees
on infrastructure including IT infrastructure like computers and
telephones and Internet cannot spend a mere 40,000 rupees as salary on a
competent sys admin.

It is also true that people sorely lack experience and finding good
quality systems administrators and programmers is a difficult task
indeed.

Anyway I got so moved by this that I decided to write a short tutorial
on the basics of TCP/IP networking and routing.

This is by no means comprehensive, complete or instructive. It is merely
indicative and attempts to clear certain myths and put things in
perspective. That is all. You are always welcome to correct me whenever
I am wrong.

You can refer to http://www.sirsasana.org/seminar 

for the slides of day I. Unfortunately even the slides are not
comprehensive enough. In any case let us get started.

Before we start I request you to go through the excellent IP addressing
tutorial here.

http://www.sirsasana.org/seminar/papers/IP_addressing.pdf

It is not written by me, so you can trust it. :)

First of all certain basics.

a) Every IP address has a network portion and a host portion and the
network portion always starts at the left end (prefix) and the host portion
starts at the right end (suffix). This has nothing to do with little
endian or big endian arithmetic.  ( Hope this does not confuse)

For instance, in 192.168.1.5 , the network portion starts with 192...
and the host portion starts with 5 backwards.

And you should learn to use subnet masks well. According to RFC1918,
private addresses in the range 192.168/16 can be used for private
networks. Also 10/8 and 172.16/12.

This means a subnet mask with the first 16 bits set to 1. Subnet mask is
nothing but a special form of IP address in which the bits that are set
to 1 indicate the network portion of IPs in that network.

I shall try to give as many examples as possible to illustrate the
concepts. Perhaps it will help you a bit.

So in this case, 192.168.0.0/16 or 192.168/16 means every IP address in
that network has the network portion constant: the prefix of every IP
will be 192.168. All IPs will have the form 192.168.x.x where x stands
for any integer between 1 and 254.

And the suffix stands for the host portion.

The IP address dished out by most DHCP servers behind NAT dole out IP
addresses in the 192.168.1/24 range.

It is really easy to construct a subnet mask with this convention.

What is the IP address mask with the first 16 bits set to it?

Obviously it is 255.255.0.0.

What is the mask for /24 networks?

It is 255.255.255.0.

But things get complicated when the masks cross the IP address byte
boundaries. But the underlying concept is the same.

For instance, a mask of 255.255.255.240 has  a network portion of /28.

If you have trouble figuring this out, just type out the BCD hex
representation.

For instance in my favourite pdksh shell,

I type

$ printf "%0x\n" 240
f0

So the first 4 bits of the 8 bits are set to 1. This network can have a
maximum of 2^4 or 16 hosts. Of course you have to give allowance to
broadcast addresses but we are discussing basics now. Let us ignore that
for the moment.

Now you have a grasp on how to interpret IP addresses and the network
they reside in with the help of subnet mask.

Subnet masks are usually represented in the 255.... form but it helps to
think in the other form I used above /bits.

Onto the second important concept now.

b) Gateways are required only for conveying packets between networks. It
is never used for "routing" packets within a network.

So for instance in a 192.168/16 or 192.168.1/24 network, there would be
no need for a gateway to reach any host/router within 192.168 or
192.168.1 network.

It is meaningless to configure a route/gateway for reaching any host
within the network portion of the IP address.

A good rule of the thumb is this.

Any IP address  with the network portion same : i.e, 192.168 in the
first case and 192.168.1 in the second case does not need any explicit
route.

The moment you configure an interface for instance,

# ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.5 netmask 255.255.255.0

the kernel figures out that a routing table entry for this network has
to have the form

# netstat -nr

Kernel IP routing table
Destination Gateway   Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
192.168.1.0  0.0.0.0   255.255.255.0   U        0     0    0  eth1

Can you interpret this line?

It says that for all destinations in the network range 192.168.1/24, the
default gateway is 0.0.0.0.

Which is to say that no gateway is required.

Let me give you a very simple and interesting analogy.

For going to Bangalore or Kashmir you do not need a visa or passport.
Since they belong to India. Gateways are the people at the
boundary of a region to help you cross network boundaries.

The main point that many people miss is this. You do not have to specify
any route manually for this. 

It is obvious to the kernel. If you configure an IP with a subnet mask,
all hosts in that network automatically become reachable and you can
ping them. If you cannot ping them, something is wrong somewhere. 

You can ping? Good. Now let us move on to the next topic.

c) Adding gateways for hosts and networks

You can add entries to the kernel routing table in two ways. You can add
host specific routes or network specific routes. And then you have a
default route. It is like a fallback. Almost like the error condition
in a C program. If nothing else works, take this route. Hence it is
called "default". 

It is very instructive and interesting that most packets on the Internet
actually take the default route most of the time. :)

This is because very few sites run dynamic routing protocols and all
static routing relies mainly on the default route.

You can inspect the default route entry very easily.

Train yourself to identify the same since you will be seeing it often.

Default route line :

0.0.0.0     192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0         0 eth1

This seemingly innocent line does all the work for you.

It says that for a wildcard destination of 0.0.0.0, the gateway is
192.168.1.1.


The way to interpret routing tables is this.

Ask this question: Which is the destination host/network?

The first field of the netstat -nr output on linux boxen.

Which is the gateway to reach that host/network?

The answer lies in the second field. Then you should ask: Can I reach
the gateway directly? I can only use IPs that are directly reachable
from my machine as gateways.

Now I got this from my home BSNL network and 192.168.1.1 is the IP
address of the BSNL modem.

On the public interface of the modem, the phone line has a PPPoE/PPPoA
allocated public IP. So the modem simply acts as a two port router which
dumbly ferries packets both ways.

Now, I want you to focus on a key concept.

All the entries configured as "gateways" in the kernel routing table
have to be directly connected.

What does this mean?

You should be able to ping them without adding any route.

Which is to say that the moment you assign an IP address to an interface
or an alias, the kernel automatically adds the routing entry for all
hosts on its network.

You can only add a particular host on this network range as gateways.

It is impossible to use as a gateway a host which is not accessible
without adding a route. This is like the proverbial chicken and egg
problem. So this will not work.  All gateways have to be reachable
without a specific routing entry.

Now, let us see how to add a host specific route. Usually host specific
routes will not be needed but sometimes this facility comes in handy.

#  route add -host 10.1.1.5 gw 192.168.1.1
# netstat -nr
Kernel IP routing table
Destination  Gateway      Genmask       Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
10.1.1.5    192.168.1.1  255.255.255.255 UGH       0 0          0 eth1

Simple eh?

Yes indeed.

You can quickly spot a host specific route with the subnet mask
"Genmask" field. It will be all 1s.

This is the case for all point to point links like PPP over dialup
links.

To add a network specific route, it is again simple.

# route add -net 10.1.1.0/24 gw 192.168.1.1
# netstat -nr
Kernel IP routing table
Destination   Gateway     Genmask        Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
10.1.1.0     192.168.1.1  255.255.255.0   UG        0 0       0 eth1

I have snipped out the relevant entry for you.

You could also use the subnet mask method if you prefer for the route
add command.

d) Subnets and physical interconnectivity

A router is any device with more than one interface on which you are
running the IP protocol ( don't get academic on this). For all practical
purpose Internet has only IP today.

This interface could be a physical link like an ethernet interface, a
USB NIC, a Wifi interface, a bluetooth dongle or a serial port running
PPP.

Please don't get confused with the details.

Break the problem down into its logical equivalent.

An interface has an IP address. Every IP address has a subnet mask. So
every IP address needs a network portion and a host portion.

So now, a device with multiple physical interfaces running IP will
obviously belong to multiple subnets.

Why?

Reason is simple. It is stupid to have two interfaces have the same
network address/subnet mask. Why would you do that? You can eminently
use aliases for adding as many IP addresses in as many network ranges
you want on a single physical interface.

The basic purpose of having multiple interfaces is to route packets
between networks. So obviously they should belong to multiple networks.

And there is a very good correspondence between the physical
interconnectivity and the IP address allocation.

I think you got my idea. If you don't please read again. It is not so
hard to understand.

It used to be that case for several years that only routers had more
than one interface.

But nowadays every laptop has a Wifi interface and an ethernet interface
and the even mobiles have internet connectivity. So the term router has
assumed much larger significance  now and perhaps lost its original
definition.

Oops!

My tutorial became really long.

TCP/IP networking is tremendous fun and a source of joy if you spend
effort and time understanding the basics.

There are plenty of tools in the UNIX world all free and open source for
you to play with and learn networking.

I am by no means a tools guy but the niceful ping command, traceroute,
hping, socat, netcat, iperf, tcpdump, sing, fping and so on come to
mind.

But you really cannot do anything much without spending sweat and blood
understanding how the Internet works.

You can apply the above logic to even logical interfaces exported by
hypervisors like Xen or emulators like qemu. Even on pseudo interfaces
like tun/tap, bridge or most other, the scenario is very similar.

Networking is by no means simple: so take your time to play with it and 
learn. All you need is a linux PC you can get for a throwaway price.

You can also buy an ethernet hub on the cheap in Richie street. Get
another PC and you are all set to do network hacking.

You could of course use virtual machines for learning the same. 

Hope you enjoy reading this the same way I enjoyed writing the same.

Thanks!

Best of luck!

I can now just forward this mail to those who ask basics of network
questions to me.
The material was  a quick summary , not really basics but rather the
fundamentals.

I am sure many would benefit from this effort of yours.

Keep up the good work.

Today I got a chance with puppy.. its just an amazing ride.... everything is
right out of the box..

Thanks for introducing this to me.. I heard before about puppy.. but I
didn't get the oppertunity..

the latest version puppy 3.01(SeaMonkey) I don't know why they put the
name.. may be because It got the Seamonkey browser..

It also have ntfs-3g.. for filesystem.. alsa for sound.. what else do you
want in a memory linux?

So Keep Exploring the linux world with puppy.. (Puppy.. grow quickly because
we need you..)

Thanks,
Mohan.

I think a fast distro need not be a shiny distro.. But puppy is lot better
than any other small distros.

I used dsl previously, but It failed in some machines with sound and Video,
frequently.

Compared to dsl, I can say puppy is dam good..

I don't know about slax,FeatherLinux. If anybody know, put something about
it..

Thanks,

This is not always true. It is not "stupid" to do this if you know what
you are doing.

In which case you will not have to read this tutorial. :)

bridge(4) interfaces work this way.

trunk(4)  on OpenBSD work by assigning two interface the same IP
address.

carp(4) on OpenBSD again relies on this.

What is the common thread?

All of them provide redundancy/load balancing in some form. A good
example would be a wired and a wireless link. Or a costly and an
affordable tariff.  In such cases you want fail over or something
similar.

Exactly. Its far better than any other *small* distro. And, i have also used
DSL; that was really *old fashioned* than puppy.
Puppy is also good for live one.

One area where I used this prior to DNAT arrival in iptables was to 
assign the same IP address to two interfaces, creating different routing 
tables for packets that arrive at different interfaces, iptables for 
filtering thereby creating a routed pseudo bridged firewall with a DMZ 
carrying public IP addresses.

ebtables arrived pretty recently (2003) till when that was relevant. I 
do agree that it has lost most of its relevance in recent times and 
avoiding this makes for clean segregated networks.

ebtables was important for use edge boxes where we used proxies behind 
firewalls and NAT helpers did not exist for many protocols. Still corner 
cases. Many of these were also addressed by tunneling as most of these 
interactions were between trusted sites.

Hello,
        Please post the hardware on which you have tried puppy
linux..I have tried puppy linux on P-3 with 128Mb ram..It worked
fine...And in my P4-2.4 with 512MB RAM it was really very fast...But
small linux are made with the thought that they will be used in old
computers.. Puppy linux and many other small size linux can be used to
rEuse the old computers..Thus reducing Ewaste..If we can make a h/w
list on which puppy/small linux works fine then it would be very
helpful to those who want to reuse their old computers..

One more useful site is http://www.leenooks.com..It has the list of
Linux Incompatible hardwares. I used before I got my digital camera :]

The Emacs tutorial, the one you get by starting Emacs and typing C-h
C-t (that is Ctrl-h followed by Ctrl-t) is pretty good.  You should
try that out before you attend any Emacsy Howto-Talk.

I would not call that sheet of key bindings a "tutorial" :-)

The dead tree version of the Emacs manual comes with a detachable
three fold reference card. It is available online, of course, and is a
little more comprehensive than the one at the link above. Google for
"emacs reference card version 22"

A small info..

the Realtek RL8139 ethernet problem is solved.. the below commands will make
the 8139too driver work correctly..

ifconfig eth0 down
rmmod 8139too
modprobe 8139too media-0x01
dhcpcd

thats all.. dhcpcd(or dhclient) will take care everything..

I found that the best way to learn emacs is to use it in anger - resolve 
to use only emacs for a week or so for all your editing needs, and by 
then you should "get" it's magic :). I found the same aversion to it 
from a colleague who is more used to vi - luckily I'm in a position to 
mandate it's use, and I'm happy to report she's picking up :D.

Emacs has taken big strides in user friendliness over the past 12
years. I'd be very surprised if you have made serious attempts to
learn Emacs in the past dozen years and not made any kind of headway.

I can tell you how I went about learning to use Emacs. If it works for you...

1. I learned to the do the basic stuff using menus
2. I learned to use the help system. C-h v, C-h f and  M-x apropos  ->
these three commands are worth their weight.... hm, in well written
lisp code
3. I was given a basic .emacs by my sysadmin. Digging into it and
messing with it started me on a joyful journey of programming and
tinkering... You should do the same. Start with the site  emacs file
that comes with most distros these days
4. I read the Emacs tutorial
5. I checked out Eric Raymond and Debra Cameron's book from a library
and read through most of it:
http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Emacs-Third-Debra-Cameron/dp/0596006489.
I read the second edition, and it was very good. For a beginner
learning to use a new editor, this book works much better than the
Emacs Manual. I would expect the 3rd edition to be similarly
gratifying
6. Get more sophisticated in your tinkering - start learning features
of Lisp. Start looking up the Elisp Manual
7. More tinkering... reading the emacs sources.... more tinkering..

Repeate 6 and 7 till you stop programming. :-)

And add your new found knowledge to emacswiki.org so that

my current problem is that I cant get the Meta key to work on my mac.  
So anger is no use unless I solve that

If you ever need to sort a file by IP
address, this little command  will
serve you well:

sort -t . -k 1,1n -k 2,2n -k 3,3n -k 4,4n

It will correctly sort IP addresses from
the first octet numerically, then each
following octet.

Message-ID: <d16b1c80710290036x7275b2at88d4bae4dc7046e1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I conducted a one-day Free (/Open Source) Software workshop for
Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University of
Hyderabad, Gachibowli, Hyderabad in association with IEEE Student
Chapter, Hyderabad, on Saturday, October 27, 2007.

Photos are available here:
http://www.shakthimaan.com/Mambo/gallery/album37

Students were mostly from the Masters' programme.

Thanks to Dr. Vineet, Prof. Anupama, Dr. Madhav Negi (IEEE), Dr. Atul
Negi for their help, coordination in planning this workshop, for
almost a month.

Forenoon included technical discussions/presentations: system,
embedded, device driver concepts; Linux device drivers; introduction
to OpenMoko: build, development for OpenMoko; demo of Neo1973.

Afternoon included non-technical discussions:
i-want-2-do-project.tell-me-wat-2-do , mailing list guidelines, Free
Software communication guidelines, and brainstorming sessions.

All presentations are available from:
http://shakthimaan.com/downloads.html

Regarding UoH:
More than half of the faculty have had their MS/PhDs abroad. The
university and the faculty have the freedom to implement whatever they
like, which is cool.

Students, the usual so-called "engineering students". They were quite
upbeat after the workshop. Only time can tell.

The labs use Fedora/RedHat/SuSE versions. They run their own mail+web
servers, and use NFS. There are few professors who give assignments
with Makefiles, gdb, Linux kernel compilation, but, they are just
starting, and experimenting with these.

It was announced that INR 20,000 will be alloted each year for
Free/Open Source events.

If anyone is interested in working with this team, contact me offline,
and I shall provide the contacts.

The following day, Sunday, October 28, 2007, I gave an introductory
talk on OpenMoko to TwinCling (http://www.twincling.org/), at
Department of Astronomy, Osmania University. There were about 35
people, most of them newbies. Minutes of that meeting available here
(follow the thread):
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ilughyd/message/19675

Feedback/criticisms/suggestions on the presentations welcome, as always.

SK

And moreover much more information with explanation is provided within emacs
.
For anyone who would like to learn I would also recommend icicles as it
given apropos type completino and shows the shortcuts for menu items ... etc

But ofcourse reading the emacs tutorial itself is a must !

This is called as "Thread Hijacking". Please use proper subject line
and tags when posting [commercial] and [job] related mails. This will
help in keeping your purpose of mail intact and the thread proper.
(Or were you intentionally hijacking the thread about next month's
meet so people look at your mail ;-) )

Most domain registrars let you register .in domains. And once the domain is
registered you can take that domain and host it, and its dns, on any
webhosting provider that you like. You aren't tied to whichever place sold
you the domain.

All,
I have been interested in this discussion with many people
in the past.

But my basic question remains unanswered.
When you say unix, you say vi  but not emacs
So if i want to be efficient in quick work in unix then i rather
put more effort in learning vi rather than emacs

are there any other views on tis ?

Yes. While I don't take sides on which is better between vi and Emacs,
I can assure you that Emacs has definitely helped me boost my
productivity a lot, and spending time learning it was well worth the
effort.

And the reason why I like Emacs and use it over vi is simple: I
started going through the Emacs tutorial and kept slogging through the
Emacs Info files and emacswiki.org. So, I really didn't have a fair
look at the capabilities of vim, to be frank.

And, for everyone, while I won't discourage anybody's attempt at
giving a talk on Emacs, every Emacs user has his or her own style of
use, and adapting to others' styles may be difficult. But there's one
thing common to all Emacs users (provided they adhere to the advice in
the tutorial); their left Control key's label rubs of really quickly!
:-)

HTH.

My take on this, master one and atleast learn the basics in the other. But I
have a sneaky feeling you asked this on purpose to start a long flamewar :P.
But afai's', more sysadmins use vi (..or is it vim) than emacs. Bah, I
really think I should stop here.

In case if you were wondering, I am a vim -> GNU Emacs convert and use it as
an IRC client, shell and almost configured it to run gnus if it werent for
the crappy fetchmail overhead. Oh, by the way modes exist in both the
editors which emulates the other..
e.g, viper emulates vi keybindings in emacs..

But yes emacs, does seem to give me that "pinky" problem. First time I used
it, I kept hitting [ESC] to change modes..heh

You can try amarok / rhythmbox if you want a full featured audio library management software.
Or if you prefer lightweight software, mpd + any mpd client would suffice ( I recommend sonata or ncmpc ).

For video, vlc or mplayer would play any format you can think of.
mencoder is a powerful command line conversion utility.
If the manpage of mencoder is too overwhelming for you, there are gui options available.

Maybe its because vi is present in all Unix based operating systems,
as guaranteed by the POSIX standard.

I am an emacs fan and used to hate pressing the esc key and 'i' key
when forced to use vi.

        I have been using UNIX and Emacs since 1987.  I am not sure I
 agree with the statement above:  TECO Editing MACroS , or Emacs, was
 first created in 1976, and inspired by TECMAC and TMACS, a pair of
 TECO-macro editors. TECO was first written in the 1960's.

        Incidentally, vi was also first released in 1976, so they are
 equally ancient, and neither can claim precedent.

        That is your choice.  I tend to start a background emacs under
 screen when I log in, and then emacsclient -c file.c is actually faster
 than running vim on it.

> are there any other views on tis ?

        Of course there are.  Did you think the whole world was just
 black and white?

emacsclient -c sounds like emacs 23 :)
I am long awaiting its release especially for the multitty feature !

Hi,
	Firstly its GRUB (GRand Unified Boot loader) and not grup :) . To  
restore it, insert your Fedora  DVD/Rescue CD and boot into rescue mode.

You will be in a root shell soon.. Type the following

chroot /mnt/sysimage

grub-install /dev/sda (This installs grub onto the MBR master boot  
record)

exit

System will now restart. Remove the DVD/CD and you should see grub  
loading. If you run into issues, with the above method, post the  
error message generated by the grub-install script and I'll get back  
to you.

Note: Replace hda with sda if you are using an IDE hard disk and a  
Fedora version<F7.
In F7 even if you are using an IDE hard disk use sda
If you are using a SATA/SCSI hard disk always use sda

Regards,

Karthik Ramgopal

I have been staring at that for 2 days. I finaly figured out that I  
need a .emacs file. So I put
set-mac-command-key-is-meta =1
did not work, then tried:

(set-mac-command-key-is-meta t)

did not work

 How about having a conference name without the words "free", "FOSS",
"GNU" ? Enough of (un) conferences are happing in India with word
Free/FOSS . Organizers should try an avoid using these commodity words
but at the same time come up with a name which is
a) simple ( we dont like Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious names)
b) makes some sense ( no weird acronyms or remixed words please,
FOSSCHE will not make sense to any newbie)
c) Preferably newbies/end users should be able to associate herself
with the name (read "branding")

Also, having a mascot for the conference will be cool.

Check this eweek article titled "The Web's 12 Scariest Applications".
http://www.eweek.com/article2/0%2C1895%2C2208185%2C00.asp

According to this article, bit9 (
http://www.bit9.com/news-events/press-release-details.php?id=63) has placed
firefox as no:3 in the list of top popular applications with critical
vulnerabilities.

Does it mean as opensource applications become more popular, their
vulnerabilities are also becomes visible?

        So what exactly is the goal of the conference?  Just some people
 getting together to have fun? (in which case, why bring it up on a
 Linux mailing list?)  For it to be discussed on this forum, I would
 have thought that freedom would have been an integral part of the goal,
 so free software is not just a commodity phrase -- it is a foundational
 cause of such conferences.

        Are we beginning to lose sight of what drives free software?

I recently had the "Kodak moment" where a leading expert over an
informal discussion opined that since a large number of Indian
e-Commerce websites are IE compliant (?) it means that Firefox and other
browsers are insecure. While in that particular case
http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/phishing-protection/ and
http://www.mozilla.org/security/security-announcement.html did provide
information, it appears that this FUD of IE being "more secure" is going
to take time to be killed

You are not getting my point. What i want to say here is "Why every
free software based conference has to use the word FOSS" ? Cant we
think out of the box ? Also, why FOSS conferences come up with such
ugly names. What is wrong if we come up with a name which has some

when the product is good, packaging is irrelevant. We are not selling  
toothpaste here - where the only difference between on brand and the  
other is in the packaging. We are doing FOSS, so why not call it a  
FOSS Conference? The name is not important - what we do is important.

Hi,

My thoughts below:

\--

To those who have already tried the product, and know it is good?

It depends on who your audience is.

1. People who are already familiar with FOSS. They are not particular
about the name, and just come to learn new stuff, and meet people.

2. People who are new to FOSS (school, college folks, general public
et. al.). They need to know about FOSS, and also require branding.

Most of the conferences/unconferences use a FOSS name, and get
sponsors for branding, so it meets all the requirements.

?????? (synonymous to "thirst" couldn't quote appropriate word in english. "??

???????????? ?????? :-) (thirst for freedom)

my suggestion is not the translation "thirst" but "??????"

My LAN has 192.168.0.0/24 behind the shorewall.
I have forwarded the ports in my modem by portforwarding.
i.e i have forwarded the port 3389.
and I DNAT this to  one of my particular machine in my LAN.
But I am facing following problem, 
i.e. I use the RemoteDesktop through SONICWALL which has given to work.
(I think the sonicwall is run the RDP @ random port numbers)
The sonic wall is allowing the RDP through https & some activeX controls.

can any Luggi suggest how to solve this?

just to reiterate with some clarifications about venue, scope and  
organisation:

1. The conference will be conducted by Ilug Chennai with logistic  
support from NRC-FOSS. Basically this means handling the money as the  
lug does not want to enter into those complications. So why does nrc- 
foss not want to conduct it? Simple, nrc-foss is a national body, and  
could be drowned with requests to conduct conferences all over the  
place. Hence we have the policy of giving logistic support to any lug  
that wants to conduct a conference.

2. Chennai was chosen for the first conference since both the lug and  
nrc-foss are headquartered here. Since it is the first for us, it  
makes it easier to iron out any bugs before moving elsewhere.

3. We had originaly proposed Anna University Main Campus as the  
venue, but at the meeting it was felt that MIT is more accessible -  
Railway station at the gate, on the national highway so all buses  
pass that way, airport 15 minutes away, less traffic problems,  
compact campus, and, most important a large and active local LUG.

4. All these decisions were taken in open meetings - first of the LUG  
and later of lug and nrc-foss members at MIT.

5. The focus of the conference will be on newcomers to the FOSS arena  
and encouraging first time speakers. We hope also to get good number  
of speakers from the academic world who are working with foss tools  
in areas like NLP, geo-spatial computing, bioinformatics, embedded  
etc, where a lot of work is being done, but none of it so far  
available to the FOSS community.

Call for participation will be coming out shortly, which will seek to  
crystalise these ideas.

Subject: [Ilugc] LiveUSB booting problem
Message-ID: <72288b670710310412v6d71c237he3c145d74c32e3dc@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I recently downloaded the Gutsy liveCD iso and tried my hand at making a
live USB out of it.
This is what I followed,
http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/09/28/usb-ubuntu-710-gutsy-gibbon-install/


The guide uses SysLinux as the boot loader. It worked well. However, I
wanted to try with GRUB as boot loader.
I used the liveCD (VMWare-d the live iso, actually) and ran grub-install.

My usb drive (/dev/sdb1) was mounted to /media/disk (fat32 format, single
partition)

# grub-install --root-directory=/media/disk /dev/sdb1
and got no errors (except for one xfs error, which is not fatal and caused
by a bug).

Device map :
(fd0)    /dev/fd0
(hd0)    /dev/sdb

Then I added a menu.lst with the following contents:

default 0
hiddenmenu
timeout 3

title Gutsy LiveUSB
root (hd0,0)
kernel /casper/vmlinuz root=UUID=0341-9F80 ro quiet splash
initrd /casper/initrd.gz
quiet
savedefault
boot

After Grub, I get the Ubuntu logo and the orange progress bar. The bar
doesn't show any progress for sometime and then I get a prompt which says
(initramfs).

What am I missing?
I've checked that the vmlinuz and initrd.gz files are where menu.lst claims.
Also, I was able to ls -l the files in the USB drive. Thanks in advance.

Subject: [Ilugc] [Commercial] Why not enroll in FOSS India Awards?
Message-ID: <47288B1A.9040009@efyindia.com>

Hi,

Are you working on any free software or open source (FOSS) project? Do 
you know anyone who is?

There's a great opportunity for all Indian FOSS contributors to showcase 
their work at the national level, and perhaps global too! Plus, the 
development team (or individual) can get a minimum cash prize of Rs 25,000!

But, there's more to it than just cash prize. The winners will get 
exclusive coverage in LINUX For You magazine, and openITis.com (aka 
linuxforu.com). Which in turn could mean: (a) more media coverage for 
the project and its developers, (b) publicity amongst targeted 
customers, and (c) more contributors getting attracted to the project.

Launched with an initial kitty of Rs 5 lakhs, the FOSS India Awards aim 
to recognise India's top 20 FOSS projects. The LINUX For You team is 
working with FOSII (Forum for Open Source Initiatives in India) on this 
venture.

The registration for FOSS India Awards is FREE! All one has to do to 
register is to visit http://www.openitis.com/awards/ and fill in the 
two-minute form. Registration for FOSS India Awards is open till 15th 
December '07. The awards will be announced during Open Source India Week 
(aka LinuxAsia 2008) during the 2nd week of February '08.

Please do forward this message to anyone whom you believe is working on 
a FOSS project, and is a good candidate.

Let's prove to the World that India contributes to FOSS too...

Best Wishes!
LINUX For You team

It would be a bit more helpful to troubleshoot, if you describe where
the error pops up, etc.
