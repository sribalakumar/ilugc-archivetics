The following forward gives information about the upcoming FreeBSD 7
release.  It is also interesting to note in the paper that PostgreSQL was
35% to 45% faster than MySql during the tests.

Howdy all,

Here is a nice summary of the performance characteristics (and new features)
of the upcoming FreeBSD 7 release:

   http://people.freebsd.org/~kris/scaling/7.0%20Preview.pdf<http://people.freebsd.org/%7Ekris/scaling/7.0%20Preview.pdf>

Per the graphs in the paper,  on the MySQL benchmark, Linux 2.6.22 is 15%
slower than FreeBSD  7 (using the ULE scheduler).   Linux v2.6.23 with the
much
publicized  "completely fair" scheduler turns out to be much slower than
v2.6.22, at approx 75% of the performance of FreeBSD 7+ULE.

Koshy

Hi  Ramadas,
Any domain registrar will allow name server changing option(and other domain
control options), else they cant host their site at all :)
In domains.webspace2host.com also all the standard options are there.

But what Sam Sharma asks is Managed DNS option i.e. option to add A record,
CNAME record etc... and domain forwarding options.

These are additional services which are usually charged extra by any domain
registrars.
These options will generally be available free thro CPanel/WHM by the web
space providers.

Regards,
Mugunth

 To change K3B Temp directory, click on the icon on the bottom-right
of K3B main window.

        If this is a one time thing, why not change root password, give
 the new password to the temporary root, and change it back when the
 regular admin returns?

        If it is an ongoing thing, sudo can achieve similar things -- the
 difference is that you give and take away sudo rights as needed. Or
 consider trusting the junior admin (I mean, if they mean to do harm,
 they can do so when the cat is away).

you can try netdomains.in

If I am right he has the rs.200 offer for .in too.

It allows for members in registered group to get discounts on the apress

Though, I should refrain from saying this, it is a
careless behaviour by the OP. You aren't supposed to

Message-ID: <1193978102.8633.4.camel@appu>

Hi,

When I log into kde session, I am able to see only the desktop
wallpaper. There is no panel or windows or desktop icons visible. When I
do Alt+f1 I get the kmenu but once i select an application, only the
wallpaper is displayed. 

I was able to work with kde for sometime. I was trying to install and
run screenlets on kde when I suddenly lost (only wallpaper display) the
kde session. I am also running compiz (not sure if it crashed). compiz
was running for atleast 10 days without any issues.

I tried to re-login/restart but the same result. When I login I am able
to see panel and all the desktop icons, then the screen goes blank and
comes back with only the wallpaper. Alt+tab does not work too.

When I login to gnome everything compiz+screenlets works well.

I am using gusty. Any pointers would be helpful.  kde is currently not
usable at all!!

hi,
While hosting a website they specify a term "Data Transfer / Month" is this
the memory i use while uploading/downloading the website content via a FTP.
hope that is correct . And what about the traffic i.e, does this "Data
Transfer / Month" specifies to memory utilized by others in
viewing/downloading my site and its content(Browsing).
Since a webhost provider provides me with a 0.5GB free monthly transfer and
my website size is  13MB +mysql (max 5MB)
when the site traffic increase should i pay and get a higher "Data Transfer

 welcome to real world. Give some one the best of teh products without
branding/packaging for free, chances are they will throw it in
dustbin. Gift wrap a bad product and charge a premium people love it.
Todays world is driven by packaging and this is a mistake every FOSS
conference makes.
 If only good products were to succeed  winblows would have failed to
see the day of light. Good packaging is equally important.

Not exactly a proper solution but try renaming ~/.kde folder to something

Dear Friends,


I have an xml file and my requirement is to build a mysql table and
push the value of the xml file into the table.
I would request a pointer on how to build a table at run time after
look the xsd file. Is there any straight way tool for solving the
problem, I heard xmlspy solves the problem. Any pointer is much
appreciated.

Thanks and best regards

Message-ID: <51702CA7-38C6-407A-B7F9-C543E489ECE0@thenilgiris.com>

hi,

I had a bunch of postgres databases on my server which were (as far  
as I know) set to unicode. They were happily accepting tamil, telugu,  
finnish etc characters. Recently I got complaints that the databases  
were barfing on non-ascii characters - so they were. I looked and  
found to my horror that most of them were in Latin1 encoding. Is it  
possible that a dist-upgrade could change the encoding of the  
databases from unicode to Latin1? An example is http:// 
nrcfosshelpline.in/code/. This database was all along accepting tamil  
characters. After the dist-upgrade it is no longer doing so.

XML Spy costs a fortune.

How often do you get new Schemas and how often do you want to create
these tables? Once during design time or is it in run time? How big is
your schema going to be? Looks like you are doing some B2B stuff?

If you are in the Java world, I would create convert the XSD into a
set of Value Objects (POJO alias beans alias Records/Struct in the
C/C++ world). I would then manually create the tables that map on to
the beans. Java Hibernate does have an option to create the tables
from these beans. But still we do have to code a little. I haven't
tried the last part yet, myself.

I don't prefer to use an automated tool to create a DB Schema using an
XML Schema.  I consider that risky. Consider the different name spaces
and some in-efficient  XSDs that can be given as inputs.  You might
end up creating redundant tables due to a bad XSD. The Table naming
conventions would take you for a ride if you do it
automatically.Sorry, if I sounded a little discouraging.

OOPS... I remembered just now. You work on PHP right? Sorry, I don't
have a direct answer for your question. But the answer that I gave
might help others (may be?). But if you want to understand how to get
a pointer on how to do some "intelligent and manual" mapping between
XSD and DB Schema, I can send you a detailed mail on that?

Is it possible to call a C++ code from Java?
Yes it is possible using JNI API (you have to do some coding here).
With this you can call functions and APIs written in C++ into Java.

Is it possible to call a Java Class from C++ ?
Yes, you can using a system call to invoke the JVM and then passing
the MAIN class name as a parameter

Is it possible to call a particular java class's method alone from C++?
I don't think so.

Did I answer your question?

Thanks!! I backed up my .kde and removed the .kde file.  Now I am able
to get into kde.  Is there logs that I can check for the error?  I am
positive it about logging but not sure which one to go after.  I want to
understand what happended so that I dont get into the same problem
again.

Subject: [Ilugc] [JOBS] Designers and developers
Message-ID: <472B6476.7000709@gmail.com>

Hello All,

At Serendio, we have all been busy developing our core framework for the 
last couple of months and now we find that we have outgrown 3 folks in a 
garage product team. So I am looking for a few not too normal UI 
designers, hardcore developers and other assorted "services is boring" 
kind of people.

Our goal is to push the extreme and as a result, I am only looking for 
people who are willing to push the limits. If interested, please send 
your resume to me  and we will take it to the next level.

Regards,
Vaidhy

PS: Spamming the list by sending reply to all is a sure way that I will 
not look at the resume :)
PPS: I will be at the Open coffee club meeting if you prefer to talk to 
me before sending the resume.

ok, maybe I put it a bit harshly, but it is not good for a mailing  
list to subscribe to another group/list - the problem being, where to  
stop? which ones to subscribe to? In short, a huge can of worms.

Your kdm probably crashed so that your background is visible but no
windows.  Switch to another terminal, or see if you can open a new terminal
with a right click and see if dcopserver is running or not. Try restarting
that, or restarting kdm.

For a moment I read Antano asking about if the LUG (and not the list)
can be registered (and not subscribed). If I recall O'Reilly still runs
a similar program off http://ug.oreilly.com/register.csp.

But I may have comprehended the original mail wrongly

Sir,
     In my Acer PC (AMD athlon), System date is frequently changed abruptly.
To synchronize the  RTC(hardware) with system date and time( software), I
edit grub as

kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.9-22.EL ro root=LABEL=/ rhgb quiet *noapic acpi=off*
Now system will not switched off automatically during shutdown.

Any other Idea to set an RTC date and Time with system date and time?

 And what is wrong in that ? Toothpaste is used by millions every

Any offence, if every person on this earth use FOSS daily as they use
toothpaste ? Any dreams broken, if FOSS becomes a household entity ?
 You got any problems with wide spread of FOSS ?

I am sure many of us are ready to write reviews on books.

Hi,

Today, I tried to use GmailFS in puppylinux. I follow Instructions
given in the below page,
http://richard.jones.name/google-hacks/gmail-filesystem/gmail-filesystem.html

But I couldn't succeed. Is there any better weblink that gives more
details about mounting gmailFS?

Also I need to know what are the dependencies for GmailFS? What is
mean by FUSE-PYTHON bind. Is there any need to
download FUSE-PYTHON package?

Thanks,
Mohan R

1. There is a berkley xml embedded database  (opensource) by oracle . Needs
no setup , has binding in most language. DB is stores in flat file similar
to sqlite.Very efficient and fast.Supports xpath and xquery.

2.You can try the traditional method of having something map the xml to
conventional DB. as usual you have 101 ways to do this in perl . One of
which would be . DBIx::DBStag  ->
http://search.cpan.org/~cmungall/DBIx-DBStag-0.09/DBIx/DBStag.pm<http://search.cpan.org/%7Ecmungall/DBIx-DBStag-0.09/DBIx/DBStag.pm>
.
By the DBIx in the above module is a database abstraction layer which
supports any database type.So you can theoritically take the xml file and
store it as tables in conventional DB or to ldap or to xml file system or
even to facebook.
Besides that , even a perl paranoid programmer can use it , as like almost
all perl modules on cpan , there is working code in the synopsis section of
the documentation . You will have to just take the code change 1 line - the
db connection string. Then you can use it as a stand alone program which you
can invoke from other programs.

Tramp uses FUSE?  You sure of that?  I couldn't find anything with a
quick google ... but am curious about this.

Also has anyone gotten tramp working (with ssh) on Windows?  (That
might be OT, but hey the emacs/tramp part of it is free software.) :)

I should have stated similar thing instead of same. Sorry about the
misguidance.
For all thats is tramp predates FUSe by over many years :)
sshfs uses fuse though.

Probably not - I can imagine the thousands of teeth it saved, which

While thinking about titles, a phrase popped up in my mind. Perhaps too long 
for a title but you could consider using it as a caption or whatever if you 
all like it -- "FOSS"tering Freedom.

Rishab Aiyer Ghosh (if any of you remember him from mid to late 90s editions
of PC Quest) didn't forget it.  Some very interesting work he is doing on
open source related policy includes coining the term FLOSS - Free/Libre and
Open Source Software.

(unless we are doing a copyright or trademark violation for the beer company)

Trademark violations?  You might just be able to get the beer company
to sponsor this with free beer.  That will take care of "popularizing
FOSS" too.

Sounds good, like "Foster's FOSSTER '07" ... and we can subtitle it
"Think free beer, and not just speech" ...

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

The Indian Linux Users Group, Chennai[1] Chapter, in association with
NRC-FOSS[2], Chennai take great pleasure in inviting you to
participate in the FOSS Conference to be held at MIT, Chromepet,
Chennai from noon on Friday Feb 1st 2008 to noon on Sunday Feb 3rd
2008.

THE ORGANISERS

ILUGC is one of the oldest lugs in the country and has been
continuously active since it was founded. It keeps a low profile and
specialises in grass roots work all around Tamilnadu (and in the
neighbouring states too). Under it's guidance, many lugs are active in
colleges and towns all around Tamilnadu. At the same time, ILUGC
members are in the forefront of the FOSS movement both at the national
and international level.

NRC-FOSS, a Central Government Project, funded by the DIT and jointly
run by CDAC and AU-KBC, Chennai, for the past two and half years has
been actively promoting FOSS in the academic domain. It's main focus
has been getting FOSS introduced into the curriculum of Engineering
Colleges in the country. Also apart from encouraging student projects
in FOSS, it has been active in encouraging academia to release it's
work under FOSS/Creative Commons licenses. AU-KBC Research Centre,
MIT, Chennai has strengths in NLP, Bio-informatics, Wireless,
Cryptography and Embedded computing, much of which uses FOSS tools 
and has released some of this research as FOSS.

SCOPE

The conference will focus on new users/contributors to FOSS.

As Audience: First timers or newcomers.

As Speakers: First time speakers.

As contributors: Students who are doing their projects, academic
personal who have worked with FOSS tools but are yet to release their
work, and, of course, the huge surge of new users in the government
domain. At the same time, provide a forum for interaction for more
experienced developers who will be coming to the conference.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

We invite participation in the following areas - in order of importance.

1. Delegates to the conference. There is no fun in having a conference
if there is no audience. Our primary focus is on audience. Please
register as a delegate and encourage your friends to do so. We cannot
guarantee transport and accommodation, but if you have a group of
people who want to come and let us know early enough, we will try to
get your travel and accommodation sponsored.

2. Volunteers. Volunteers are the lifeblood of a conference and will
be treated as privileged persons. Volunteers are needed at the
conference venue for myriad tasks. But, more important, are volunteers
from outside Chennai who are needed to contact students, teachers,
government employees and get them to come for the conference. We
envisage holding training camps for teachers and government employees
- and will do so if we are able to convince enough of them to come. We
can send people to address meetings to motivate people to come - if
you organise the meetings.

3. Sprints. A FOSS conference that does not contribute documentation/
code is worthless. A sprint is where a group of people sit together
and finish a task. We have had sprints before, once in Loyola college
to do translation, and again, last year at MIT to do translation. A
sprint can be for translating applications, mass fixing of bugs, doing
long pending documentation, writing code etc,. Sprints need to be
carefully planned, tasks laid down before hand, participants fixed,
facilities arranged. If you are interested in organising a sprint,
please register and attend the meeting in January for finalising
proposed sprints. Since this is an entry-level conference, please be
aware that you may need a day to train volunteers for the sprint
before actually starting it. Some ideas: making a comprehensive list to
be uploaded to the ILUGD Hall of Shame websites, completing a list of
all lugs in India, making a directory of FOSS contributors in India,
contribute to the OpenMoko project ...

4. Student projects in FOSS. We will give special place to student
projects in FOSS - past, present and future. Now is the time for your
project - register and exhibit it at the conference. Prizes will be
given for the best projects.

5. Formal academic projects using FOSS tools. There are a huge number
of these lying unsung in university and government archives. We invite
academics to present their work here.

6. Talks. On any aspect of FOSS except installation issues. Talks will
be of 30 minutes duration with 15 minutes for discussion. note:  
installation demos will be arranged anyway

7. Mini talks - one hall will be reserved for this. 10 minute talk
followed by 5 questions.

8. Cultural contests - drawings, paintings, skits, dances ... with
FOSS as the theme. Prizes will be given for the best performances

9. Sub-conferences and BOFs - these will largely be left to be
organised by those who propose them. Facilities will be provided as
needed.

10. Workshops for teachers and government employees will be organised
by the conference organisers depending on demand.

11. The registration website will be up in a day or two. Kindly
forward this CFP to all LUG, GLUG and FSUG mailing lists.

I would request that you have at least a place holder page and then get
to word spreading - that allows bookmarking of an URL or using it in
signature. Not having any rudimentary page means that entire mail needs
to be passed around

If you want an audience solely from TN - use tamil.

If you want people even from other parts of south india, let alone north
india - to come in, stick to english.

Language chauvinism is not practical here. It is even a little silly as all
those unreadable tamil posts to the list show. They all show up as ???? or
otherwise mangle my shell display, and  as I cant read tamil anyway I just
dont bother :)

this is about FOSS and not languages. lets stop the thread here. what ever
name you would like to keep you can suggest, and let people decide. its not
about single user. its about a community.
As a ILUGC member you have all the rights to ask. but in the spirit of
community, you should be ready to accept what community decides. i am here
not to say that u didnt accept. give your suggestions. who ever organizes,
will take into consideration.

 And did I ever mention anywhere in any email that I will not accept
the name decided by the community. Or did I write any where that I am
the one who will decide the name ? Dear, please spend 30 seconds to
read the thread carefully and spend 10 seconds using the 250gms
hanging above your shoulders. I think you should be capable enough to
arrive at a conclusion that "I am only suggesting that we need not
stick to English names and not engaging in any kind of language
chauvanism".
 As for stopping the thread, why should we stop ? When members are
suggesting good and creative names you are asking them to stop ? IMHO,
it will be stupid of us to stop right now. BTW, may I ask what right
you have to order the thread to be stopped ?

 My suggestion for coming up with Indian language name was to aimed at
adding another dimension to the creativity and not add some kind of
chauvanism.
 Also, it is a good idea to read the whole email and not just few
lines before arriving at a conclusion. The reply you quoted in this
mail was originally aimed at SRS because he was thinking that a name
in local Indian language will not be cool enough.

>> And what make you think that a tamil name will prevent from people
>> around the country to participate ?

It won't actually prevent them from participating, but the naming process 
becomes complicated, because you not only have to come up with a name but an 
explanation for it as well, since it will not be self-explanatory to those 
who don't understand Tamil.

Plus, there is a basic rule for branding -- the name should be simple, 
easy-to-pronounce and have a high recall potential. If an Indic language 
name is adopted, it might not be easy for others to pronounce or remember. 
My name is just three syllables - ja+na+ni, but I have heard it pronounced 
in the worst possible ways by people unfamiliar with it! A similar fate 
might befall the event's name if chosen from Indic vocabulary.

Also, how then will the event be publicised by word-of-mouth? It will 
become, 'the name that begins with <some alphabet>', or 'the event organised 
by Chennai-LUG and NRCFOSS', or 'the event for new-comers to FOSS' etc, and 
the actual name of the event will hardly get propagated. That is not good in 
the long-run.

Ironical though it is, today, choosing an Indic name seems more chauvinistic 
than choosing an English name -- because more people seem to be able to 
read/write/pronounce English better than the language of their neighbouring 
State!

Cheers,
Jan

Unless your exhibition is very well known, it is best to stick to commonly
understood names in a common language (English). Some one from the north
or other parts of south india won't be able to figure out what the
exhibition is about if the name doesn't make any sense to them.

For instance, the FLOSS conference held annually in France has the name:
"Rencontres Mondiales du Logiciel Libre" or RMIL for short. How many
non-french speaking users will even think that this is a IT related
conference let alone a FLOSS conference?

Technical terms are quite difficult to understand when written in a
different language than what they are normally communicated in.

No one becomes a better person because of knowing one language or the
other .. or by promoting one language or the other. So lets leave all this
linguistic chauvinism at the door instead of flooding this list with all
the linguistic flag waving.

Regards,
PK

I think "FOSS Conference @ Chennai" is by itself a good descriptive name.
This could be prefixed with the year - so it could be "2008 FOSS
Conference @ Chennai" - perhaps over time it will get shortened to "FC @
C" or "FCC".

 bah, what chauvinism. I cant understand while lugs will wave the
indic computing flag everywhere, why they have  problem in Indic name
? Everyone wants to have an International conference no one is
interested in having a local conference.

Hello All,

Very good timing; It falls on week end, hence I can take off easily. 
I've few questions.

1)Do you use any open source conference management system ?  If needed I 
can volunteer to install CGPublisher and maintain it for the conference.
Please take a look at  http://www.cgpublisher.com/
2)If you want to use other publishing system, then I'm ok with.
3)Is the conference multi threaded ?  If so what are the different 
streams ?
4)We have to add information about  venue,  travel, accommodation.
5)Please not that CGPublisher is only for managing paper submissions. We 
have to use CMS for other (user independent) content.
6)Do we need a separate mailing list to discuss conference related 
activities ?
7)Is there a registration fees for conference ?
8)What does a speaker package include? 
9)Are we inviting any big shots like Rasmus ? 

I don't stay in Chennai, but I do like to contribute as a volunteer and 
speaker.  Hence I volunteer to do the paper submission management system 
remotely from Singapore.  Please note: I only want to manage the software. 

Regards
Deepan

as you may have noticed, the format of this conference is a bit  
unusual. It is not following the standard 'call for papers' -  
'deadline' - 'review' - 'suspence: is my paper chosen?' -  
'acceptance' method. Also, we are giving priority to audience,  
outstation volunteers, student projects, sprints which most standard  
software doesnt handle - so we will be rolling our own software for  
that. We probably will not have a deadline, and hope the papers,  
sprints, projects etc, will be self-selecting.

no formal streams - lets see what is submitted first, then we may  
make it into streams

yes

I am not clear what 'a speaker package' means.

I was not aware that there are big shots in the foss world - I  
thought one contributor is as good as another - but we *are* inviting  
lots of local contributors/potential contributors

thats probelm with english.. when "put" is pronounced ???? and "but" is 
pronounced ???

in indic language what you write is what you pronounce...

i am sure any one who knows tamil will not pronounce ???? as something else..

i know one and only way of pronouncing it and hope every one else too :-)

while i definitely can think of pronouning "amachu" is several possible ways.. 
???????, ?????? etc., 

not ???????.. its has to be pronounced as it is written..  similarly in hindi 
and other indic languages :-)

so the point is that, the problem is with english and not indic languages :-)

Sigh. So you think this conference is targeted only at Tamil people? Did 
the organizers state that as their intention?

Because it is their *goal* to enable computing in local languages. I 
haven't seen anywhere that this conference is only limited to 
localization. So create a track on Tamil localization, and give it a 
tamil name. No harm done.

A local conference need not be local in it's aspirations. There is 
nothing wrong in bringing international perspective to a local 
conference. It informs and inspires. When you bring such diverse 
perspectives to a conference, it helps if the language is commonly 
understood. So stop arguing for the sake of it, and try to understand 
what others are actually saying.

Dear all
  We are digressing too much. I request all to

a)Only suggest name. No discussion about reasons behind name. Let us
choose best among the names.

b)Simply do not post vaguely like why not name in xyz language.
Instead suggest some names.

c)At present whole organisation is in verly early stage. So all your
thoughts may go into
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/ChennaiConference

d)Please bear in mind that it going to be first big conference/event 
to be organised by ILUGC. It is going to be learning experience to
all of us. Treat yourself as part of the organisers.

e)Let the discussions not hurt anybody, we need all.

I was waiting for this white flag ;)

My Few Cents..

[1] Name : FOSS Conference 2008 @ Chennai.

Simple as of now and we can change the year and place next year
provided we are going to move over to Tier 2 cities.

[2] As Vamsee said, Localization can be a track or sub-conference
under this main-conference and we can have a localized name for it.
This will also enable other enthusiastic groups to have their own sub
conferences, such as ChennaiPy group.

[3] As Raman said this is the first time that we are organizing such a
big event. Though we have very good experience in organizing things
like LDD and workshops, conferences are really different. Hence we may
miss some points and we may over look certain things. Bringing it to
our focus will help us in correcting them :)

We expect all our members to offer a supporting hand and help us make
this a success, but still constructive criticisms are welcomed please
forbid from growing the thread and digressing too much.

@Bharathi,

Please close this "name hunt" soon so we can proceed discussing other
things. Else this is getting into a tail with no end. :)

So, do you plan to print the name of the conference in banners and all other 
documents in Tamil script? I can read but I don't think even Vivek Khurana, 
despite his suggestion to have an Indic name, can read it!

certainly not.. i know where to fight and where to give up :-)

i would certainly be happy if its a name indigenous to tn but won't feel bad
if its the other way around too..

i have nothing to win and nothing to lose here...

but would certainly be a "bit" more happy if its a name in the language of
this land..

Dear ILUGC,

When you get the time, please watch Linus' talk on Git at
Google[1]. It helps if you have an idea of what Git is and why it's
different from the other source (version) control systems around,
though not necessary. This is a very informative discussion. It's
about 70 minutes in duration.

Not in tamil at least.  Not when you can't differentiate (and most people in my home district of tirunelveli, and parts around it, just won't differentiate) between Pa and Ba ... Prema getting pronounced as Brema .. and see how badly mangled sanskrit slokas can get when they are transliterated (that is written in tamil script) and then read out

[horrors, even MS was susceptible to that little failing in her renditions of Sanskrit songs and shlokas, not that her voice didn't compensate for it millions of times over..]

[OT]

i analysed this quite a bit and there are two possible reasons that came to me 
from sources i approached..

1) the four "ka" etc., sounding should have existed in tamil and letter 
representation for them should have gone in the medival ages.

2) non native tamil words have such problems and such words should have been 
derived from sanskrit etc.,  

there are rules in tamil grammer as to where it should be "ka" etc., and where 
it should be "ga" 

practise makes it perfect or knowledge of grammar helps...

like a "ka" as in "kalvi" is pronouced as 'ka' and 'ka' as in 'vaanka' is 
pronounced as 'ga'

when some one mis-spells as in case of "Brema", its root as it is clear in 
this case is sanskrit

remember this is not the case 
in 'pavalam', 'paarthiban', 'pani, 'pallavan', 'paar', 'parisu', 'pattiyal', 'pendatti', 'pillai', 'pasumai' 'pari' 'pazhi' 
etc.,

while its 'ba' is the following,

'panbu' 'anbu' 'thembu' 'kambu' 'thambi' 

when its its own 'mei' that comes before its again lighter

'thappi', 'seruppu', 'appavi' etc.,

there are set of rules defined..

3) grantha letters are even now in use sa, sha,  ja for this purpose and the 
script of grantha is south-indian.

and it goes on...

foss-conf in chennai.
way to go!
wish you all the best of luck and hope to be there.

what i've discovered over the past few years,
even the word 'foss' is difficult to explain to non-foss people,
even if those people are otherwise techies.
nevertheless, 'foss' as a word is gaining traction.

am sure your event is a national event, so you need to present that in the name.
a name that is clearly understood in english would work better for
this event, but you know better what works in chennai.

a web-search shows me only 5 results for fossconf, one already
pointing to your mailing list. so i would strongly recommend you just

Message-ID: <1ab22a4b0711061213p639134b1wfdb3c607114d62d1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
          Google's Open Source Mobile Platform :
As expected, today  Google took the wraps off of the gPhone (as the
media have for months been referring to the rumored project). Google
is "leading a broad industry alliance to transform mobile phones into
powerful mobile computers," and will be licensing its software to all
comers on an open source basis under the Apache license. (The Wall
Street Journal's Ben Worthen demonstrates a miserable grasp of what
"open source" means.) Google's US partners include Nextel and Sprint,
but not AT&T nor Verizon. Phones will be available in the second half
of 2008 ? not the spring as earlier reports had speculated. News.com's
analysis warns that Google won't take over the mobile market
overnight, though they quote Forrester in the opinion that Google may
be one of the three biggest mobile players after several years of
shakeout.

good stuff balanchadar. a few suggestions:

a) am quite uncomfortable about using an 'anon' quote. what if 'anon'
one day steps forward, no longer anonymous, and claims some copyright
or moral rights over the quote? or what if the anon quote had a
totally different context? why can't we just be original.

b) am therefore suggesting a new slogan. from my interactions with all
my wonderful friends in chennai, i feel this may just resonate with
all of us and has a indic flavour in its thought:
"True Knowledge Brings Freedom."

c) the logo needs improvement. it is merely text, and is dependent on
the use of color. also, is the name final?

d) shouldn't the sentence read "ILUGC & NRCFOSS Present"? note the
singular 'present', even though i understand you wish to use an
ampersand. janani could perhaps correct this.

forgot to add, you may just find these simple 30 points, of some help
in further jazzing up the logo:
http://creative.linux-delhi.org/?q=node/440

i wrote the above book 'Art of Logo Design', published under a
creativecommons license, so those interested may find it useful.

sorry, the site may misbehave at the moment. some outage happened recently.

Looks nice!

Some suggestions:

a) If space allows, I suggest changing the '&' to 'and' -- technically 
speaking, & is used only for combining designations or two components of the 
same organisation etc. But, that's not a hard and fast rule. So, you can 
retain '&' is you so wish.

b) It should be 'Present' and not 'Presents'

c) I agree with what Niyam has pointed out -- that using an anonymous quote 
as the sub-caption could lead to copyright issues. So, perhaps we could use 
what Niyam da suggested if the others like it too.

Plus, if you need any text (perhaps notifications or whatever) edited for 
language, I will be more than happy to help.

Warm regards,
Janani

That anon quote might also not play properly when printed in a small space -
like in a newspaper ad. How about 'Free your mind' as the sub-caption? That
song can be played in the conf venue :-)

hi

We have decided on the name: FossConf. The name will be in three parts:

Name: FossConf
City: Chennai (this time)
Date: feb08 (this time)

This leaves us a choice whether to hold it once a year or twice a  
year, and also to change the city each time. The city and date for  
the next FossConf will be announced at the end of the previous  
FossConf. However, regardless of where and when it is held, the scope  
of the conference - newcomers to foss, new speakers, new contributors  
- in short 'Foss for the common man', will not change. So now we move  
to stage two - publicity and getting the common man to come to our  
conference - ideas/action please

Please forward this info to other lists

How about distributing ubuntu 7.10 desktop version during the
conference. I feel that that is one of the most user-friendly linux
distro available.

iPhone :P. The reason is simple - people don't go out and buy a 
platform, they want a phone that rocks. Of course, a foss-phone is cool, 
but I think an open mobile platform won't take off for the same reason 
that desktop Linux didn't take off - regular people just don't care. 
They simply want something that looks nice and works well enough. For a 
more irreverent take on this, refer to what Fake Steve Jobs has to say :

http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/11/its-not-phone-its-alliance.html

P.S: Warning - some of the folks here might find FSJ's blog close to 
offensive - he calls us "freetards" :D.

at this stage we can stick to #linux-india, unless there is such a  
huge volume of traffic to necessitate a separate channel

Forbid Disto Wars Please :P If any of the Distros or their Loco teams
are interested in distributing the CDs, let them do this Off
Conference. Let it not be associated with the conference so as to
maintain Distro-Neutrality in the Conference :)

I do not think that we are starting any distro war here. The only
intention is to make people use a linux distro which is user-friendly.
Because the general impression among people(atleast with whom I have
interacted) is that since linux is very difficult to operate. Since
this conference is going to be about linux for the common man. It
makes more sense if we distribute linux cd's.

Just my 2 paise

Solved the problem. Localised problem to the better gmail plugin which 
is a greasemonkey based add on.

You probably meant "distribute ^^ Ubuntu Linux CDs" :P
... 

I think, you can probably give a "choice" to the
"common man" and ask him to try out a few before he
settles for one. :)

Maybe a poll on the distros will help to decide which distro to distribute.

        This is subjective. I personally find Debian far more user
 friendly, by allowing me to make my own choices more easily (hit: I do
 not use KDE, Gnome, Exim, or postfix).

        I also find the larger number of packages integrated and tested
 in a release more user friendly, and the fact that  Sid has new
 packages, and not old ones like Ubuntu releases do.

        Of course, this list hates voicing of opinions, under the guise
 that any opinions whatsoever are  "divisive" or somehow unfriendly, so
 I fully expect to be flamed for voicing an opinion here.

Ubuntu being more or less a debian clone, and largely using a common set of
packages and a similar packaging mechanism, I find that a bit strange.

Could you expand on that?  Debian runs stable + testing + unstable, with
completely outdated packages in stable, while ubuntu has a six month release
cycle, more or less, and as far as I can see, a reasonable correspondence to
debian testing.

In fact, on a ubuntu box recently updated to the new version (gutsy) I get -

suresh@frodo 22:44:55 <~> $ cat /etc/debian_version
lenny/sid

Any criticism applied about "outdated packages" might well be applied to all
other debian versions other than unstable, come to think of it.

You are missing the most important - Linux from Scratch !! I mean,
*from scratch* ! You have an editor, POSIX manual and gnu tools to
start with ...
oh! .. and an old x86 machine ...

;) ;)

Ok, that's a nice list. Probably you would like to throw in couple of
Live CD distros - Knoppix, dsl ...

I used MailScanner for anti-virus/spam and that has an archive option 
with rules to select mail, if need be. Archives can be maintained per

        Not quite.  Ubuntu snapshots Sid, and then sits on it fora few
 months while they do their thing.  Ine the meanwhile, testing has moved
 ahead (barring bugs and library transitions, testing me 10 days behind
 unstable).

        That proves nothing.  You can have a 6 month old Lenny/Sid
 snapshot.

        Even though testing scripts only hold packages for less than 2
 weeks before migrating to testing?

there isn't need for making copies. we can manage.

We can have the approach we followed at Chennai bloggers camp.

We are planning to have the same approach at Pondy Bloggers camp to be
held next camp.

and we indeed had copies of FC7, gnewsense etc., as CDs & Ubuntu DVDs
too. and few people  indeed requested to burn DVD for them and got it.

it can happen the same way.

Subject: [Ilugc] [fossconf08]Distros which can be distributed at the
	conference
Message-ID: <727912d50711080535n6f44e9d1x135f1333da1b7ff5@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Team

The following is a list of distros out of which we can choose(based on
majority voice) which to distribute in the conference
1) Debian
2) Mandriva
3) Suse
4) Ubuntu
5) Knoppix
6) Fedora (I do not have much idea about this distro as a desktop
because I have used it only for my email server).

Regards
Vinayak

We are planning to have the same approach at Pondy Bloggers camp to be
held next month.




" We are planning to have the same approach at Pondy Bloggers camp to be

Yes!

Ubuntu's sisters: kubuntu, edubuntu.

5)Ubuntustudio. this literally rocks.
6) fedora.
7) knoppix

what about centOS? that appeals to a different sort of core audience.

since this is a foss event, you may wish to involve sun microsystems,
and you could even talk to them for opensolaris.

finally, please do not forget desktopBSD.

just suggestions.

Why don't we start a separate thread for each topic with respect to
the conference instead of combining everything in one single thread.

        Again, this is subjective.  I find they make Ubuntu _less_ user
 friendly, by restricting choices and making choices for the user. I
 gave up trying to configure Ubuntu for my machine; and ended up by
 wiping it out and going back to Debian. Not that the task was
 impossible; it just took too much work to undo all the choices made.

 Unless you are looking for  a Debian clone, every other distro is
_user_unfriendly_

Yes, and in my case I had to rescue my exim config from debconf - either on
debian or on ubuntu - and stick it all in one monolithic file the way exim
originally works.

I would probably spend time doing that for a few other things too, rather
than have the configs, spoolfiles etc scattered all over the filesystem,
quite frequently in entirely non default places that are totally debian
specific. Just not bothered to do so yet.

Which then results in debian specific mailing lists for various pieces of
software (such as exim) getting created after exim-users@exim.org got
cluttered with debian users asking entirely debian specific config
questions, referencing debian specific config variables,  that nobody other
than debian users could answer. Irritating to say the least.

        Err, config files do not live in debconf in Debian.  Do you have
 a better example?

	Every single configuration file in Debian lives under /etc.  Are
 you sure you are talking about Debian?

 Please be more specific with your requirements. I have used mail
archiving systems which archive emails as files as well as wrote an
archiving system whcih will archive emails in mysql database (as
archived emails need to used by another app).
 Throw some more light on the requirements.

Yes. It was fairly late and I was talking about the way debian splits
configuration files (and in some cases renames them so "configure" becomes
"exim.conf"..

Standard way debian does things, but "the debian way" tends to differ in
weird and wonderful ways from the way things usually work or get
configured.

It was fairly late so I perhaps didnt express myself correctly there.
Referring to the way debian splits configs across multiple files, and in
several cases simply renames main config files into completely debian
specific names and locations (well, subdirectories of /etc/packagename)

Standard for debian, irritating and non standard for users of other
linux distros or other *nix.

Dear all

   Regarding distributing CDs, I wish we do the following

a)Have one stall to distribute CD. Certainly not free of cost.

b)Stall can have all distributions and all versions of it, few copies
pre burnt and also dumps in systems with burners.

c)Depending on the need additional copies can be burned.

d)Distro fans/fanatics provide copies to the stall in iso and/or cds.
May be they can give extra copies also. 

e)Most importantly we need atleast 5-10 volunteers to manage the
stall. Please volunteer. Every time we fail here.

f)The conferene is distro-neutral. All distros welcome and should
be treated as equal.

h)As a debian fan[atic] I will give 24cd/4dvd sets of lenny to the
stall.

If points a to f are acceptable let us freeze the topic and make it
official position of the conference.

And let us move on the next topic about the conference

May I recommend a stall where those who work on embedded stuff
(Shakthiman? ) can perhaps demo some of their embedded hardware running
interesting apps?

A lot of people are not aware that a lot of the embedded applications
these days do use Linux at the core. So demoing some products like that
may pique some interest.

for user registration on any websites related to fossconf.in, can we support
open ID instead of writing new registration stuff?

Write what new stuff? Chances are, if it?s a ticketing system it?s a ready to use ticketing + project management software of some kind that nrcfoss installed, and if so it already comes with its own userdb / registration code.

Message-ID: <68ddcb070711091623m6fdfa340tb5d9459479e0e5a4@mail.gmail.com>

dear all,

a new logo suggestion for fossconf:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/40299872@N00/1938577522/

beneath the logo you will find a description and further info in a comment.

the copyright and license terms [a modified cc-by-sa to make it more
flexible] are mentioned in the second comment,
which am sure you will find more agreeable for your event use.
used the same exact license for the freed.in event logo.
however, as always, the event belongs to the community,
so if you wish me to change the license to something even more
suitable, will be happy to do so.


please respond and comment on the logo-design, on this mailing list.

wish the fossconf.in wiki allows uploads of artworks and files with descriptions
so may share the source files with you.

fyi, authored the logo in inkscape, exported as png, and flattened in gimp.

:-)

you dont need to register to file, accept, handle a ticket. It is  
advisable to add your details in the preferences page so that the  
spam filter doesnt think you are a bot. The site gives errors now and  
then, but this is a known issue with multiple trac instances on the  
same server - I am working on that. Refresh usually works when there  
is a 500 error

keep a check on the tickets, make sure they are in the correct  
categories, get rid of spam tickets and irrelevant tickets. Try to  
find people to accept and work on tickets.

It would be a shame if this logo can not be used due to this reason. Niyam's
reasoning and design are impressive. Conveying the spirit of the event is
important in a logo design.

Perhaps Niyam can come up with a better logo.

I thought that foss is based on choice of a person. We should choose
what we want to use. As far as i see the logo does not hurt anybody's
sentiments

There are many ways to do that , template.el and skeleton.el might be
helpful from emacs wiki.

One of them takes an argument interactively and performs uses that as a
variable replacement inside a pre defined skeleton/template.

http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/CategoryTemplates has many listing of
such add ons , few of which are already a part of emacs.

The following elisp function will mark the string under cursor with 
_(...). It will not work for one special case in which there is a double 
quotes within the string.

(defun mark-i18n ()
   (interactive)
   (save-excursion
     (search-backward "\"")
     (insert "_(")
     (forward-char 1)
     (search-forward "\"")
     (insert ")")))


Put this definition in your .emacs and bind the function to the key of 
your choice.

Regards,
Vijay

black and red - dravidian party colours
rising sun - dmk symbol
hand - congress symbol
left hand - yuck

Black and Red combination will be immediately associated with
something else, especially in Chennai. Otherwise it doesn't closely
relate to the "rising sun" or "the hand" symbol used be the political
parties at first sight.

Btw, left hand is nearer to the heart and it is a custom amongst
African tribes to use left hand shake to denote that the wish comes
from the heart (which is also adopted in the Scout movement). Its we
Indians who associate left hand with something else and consider it yuck.

Niyam, can you come up with an alternate logo with a different color
than red or something replacing the red dot but still keeping your
idea intact ? That would be great :)

An artwork in reverse for printing on black will also be nice. Black 
Tees and dark grey folders/bags look good.

Orange is a colour that in some countries connotes adventure and in some

Hmmm ... I'm assuming you have the string in a buffer/file and need to
convert it from:
  foo
to:
 _("foo")

You can use keyboard macros for this.  Unless you are going to be
using this often, in which case you can use the function given.

C-x (   start defining the macro
C-x )   stop defining
C-x e  to use it

 I wouldnt say inspired since rumours of something from google have
been floating around for a long time. It would be interesting since it
will feature Java extensively in its stack. Infact there was even a
rumour that gphone will have openmoko for its software part. Which of
course turned out to be false, since android is a software platform
which other manufacturers can use in their devices, much like
openmoko. Another thing is the apache license associated with it (whch
is GPL2.0 incompatible?). IMO, some GPL compatible license would have
been wonderful which would have provided smooth sharing of code
between the "linux phone platforms", openmoko, moblin et all.
I am also wondering about the degree of openness of the devices
running android, it would be quite cool if you could hack around and
make them run openmoko or moblin.
All in all fun times ahead,

hahahahahahhaah! kenneth, you are such a delight! must remember to hug
you when i meet you!
your thinking startles me and makes me ponder on how color and
symbolism are interpreted further. inspired by you will add another 2
or 3 pages to my book 'the art of logo design' once the creativedot
site is up.

meanwhile, to address each point:

black & red is also used by airtel, and not just thousands, but
millions of brands. this because red creates a high neuro-cognitive
response in the human eye, when in contrast with black. so no, that
combination cannot be owned by any one political party, or corporate
brand, or spiritual movement, or whatever. it is universal and
popular.
for instance, it is the color combination of goddess kali, and revered
in west bengal especially.
in some countries, using the same color combination for a
*directly-competing brand* in the *same market* may be a violation.
but lemme see, so far, no other foss event in chennai or india uses
red, black, white. so we're ok. in fact, splendid!

o'reilly uses black red white for their branding, but it is distinctly
different from ours.
their event, which is oscon, uses blue and white.
again, we're distinct and different. no overlaps.

heck, both linuxasia and freed.in use black, orange, and white, and
there are no legal, moral, ethical, or any other issues about it. the
two are still very distinct. EFY also supported the event.


therefore, we can use it, as we are not trying in anyway to evoke any
other party or individual that may use that combination, directly or
indirectly in our symbolism.

then, the hand. congress? blimey! no way! the hand belongs to, well, humans!

i just found 12,300,000 results from the image-search of google for 'hand logo'
please take a look here:
http://images.google.co.in/images?hl=en&q=hand+logo&btnG=Search+Images&gbv=2

please note how the hand is also a universal symbol. again, i can only
think of the mudras depicted on buddha's statues, when i think of the
hand as a symbol.
puting the red-dot on the open hand is exactly for the reasons i
mention in the description: bharatanatyam allusion for tamil nadu's
cultural sharing with the world + openness expressed in an open hand.

incidentally, while researching on bharatanatyam for this logo design,
i learnt with joy that bharatanatyam takes multiple mudras and
gestures, combining or adapting them, to further express more ideas.
so the open hand with a red dot is just to express the ideas mentioned above.

rising sun:
japan, tibet, holiday resorts from around the world, diverse business
brands, creative movements . . .

kenneth, i urge  you to click on the link below. this is my google
search for image-results, for the key word 'rising sun logo'. i found
168,000 results
http://images.google.co.in/images?gbv=2&svnum=10&hl=en&q=rising+sun+logo&btnG=Search+Images

please note quite a few of them are also using red and black in their
color combinations.
so again, our logo is not politically-charged, but culturally,
symbolically, to capture the essence of the foss movement in tamil
nadu. in a sub-continent blessed with abundant sunshine.

left-hand:
bharatanatyam uses both hands, for a sacred and creative purpose. i
allude to that in my logo.
the logo initially had a right-hand, then i flipped it to smile at the
visual pun on 'copy-left'
again, everything goes with out ideas and values of foss.
copy-left is not yuck, but awesome! :-)
i can give a whole researched talk on the importance and understanding
of the left-hand, off-topic, over a nice cup of south indian filter
coffee, some sunny day.

http://www.geocities.com/srikrishna_innovations/fossconf.in_ellipse.jpg

hmmm ok, looks good too, but i'd like to stick to a perfect circle for
the following reasons:

a) bharatanatyam uses a perfect circle, though hand-drawn. here is my reference:
http://www.noopur.com/students.html

b) in bharatanatyam they also paint the finger tips red. i tried that
with the logo, but it looked too garish and harsh as the logo is well,
a logo, and not a photograph. so dropped it to just fingers/digits,
and the perfect circle.

c) the perfect circle also evokes the CD, DVD, and disc media.

d) works for the rising sun imagery.

e) contrast visually, of the perfection of the circle to the rough
organic brush strokes of the fingers/digits.

even then, i am okay with the use of an ellipse circle if all of you
strongly prefer an ellipse.


finally, use of other colors:
have noted in events, a lot of the collateral is screen-printed, such
as teeshirts, some banners, etc. every color adds to the cost. so i
decided to stick to one color (red) plus black. the typical background
color for the use of this logo would be black, white, grey, or even
any other color. it adapts perfectly well for that.
as kenneth notes, the red is not exactly pure-red, but a slightly orangish-red.
i could also change it to another tone of red, the hex values are: ff334cff

this is the tone i find that matches the tone of red used in bharatanatyam.

just tried it in the logo, looks good. my only worry is that getting
it to match in digital prints, teeshirt prints, etc will take some
effort at your end. but hey! we can live with that. :-)
here's the logo with the new red tone:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/40299872@N00/1946471801/


i must share with all of you that i spent a considerable number of
hours trying to find a unique mudra to draw as the logo. however, at
low-resolutions, at small sizes, the mudra becomes quite squished.
plus, each mudra in bharatanatyam conveys a variety of meanings. i
found the 'mukula' mudra the most suitable as it signifies 'bud'.
further research showed this mudra combines or adapts to form several
other meanings as well.

the open-hand mudra just conveys everything, and most importantly,
scales to form a distinct favicon in your browser. a logo that can
scale to such a small size is a pearl in an oyster. :-)


over to you guys!
hope you finalize in a day or two,
then will find time and create the banner for the websites.

please share: what is the slogan of the event?
i remember taking part in this discussion a week ago, but do not know
if this got resolved.
had recommended a slogan as well.

finally, will later add the details of the typography of the logotype as well.

:-)

 I think they are going to use _standard_ devices and not going to
manufacture the devices. So, it should be posible to run any
openembedded based distro on these devices. You can start trying it
today itself instead of waiting for Android platform to be released.
 Moreover, if this idea succeeds it can turn out to be turning out to
be a turning point for the indutry. First of all Google has announced
that the software stack will be under APL. Secondly instead of
creating there _own_ mobile handset, _own_ mobile distro and another
ecosystem, Google is creating a consortium of manufactures, service
providers and software companies. Such a consortium, if works out,
will definatley be benificial for the consumer as well as small to
medium sized players.
 So lets see what comes out. May be we are looking at the unification
of mobile industry ?

I feel a more personal touch is needed. Those who personaly know the  
people in each of the lugs please contact them personaly and sound  
them out as to whether they could send representatives to the  
conference so we could have a representative lug meet. (And keep  
nagging them until they agree). I volunteer to approach Hyderabad and  
Indore LUGs. And I'm sure we have enough Mumbai and Delhi LUG people  
to volunteer for those.

I know I'm so late in joining this discussion (which is probably closed 
already). And I also saw a lot of emails in this thread (which I didn't read 
because I wanted to see the logo through my eyes without any explanations, 
which is how anybody outside of this mailing list will see it), and here is 
what I saw...

(a) Left palm with the marudhaani dot in the centre. Very indigenous. Nice.
(b) Rising sun (but very low risk of being mixed with DMK symbol as the dot 
is organish).
(c) A bharathanatyam symbol which (to my layman knowledge) means both stop, 
as well as 'be calm, I am there' (reassuring)
(d) A longish ring finger, which (going by the cliche) means somebody 
skilled in the arts.
(e) Slender fingers usually characterises those who work hard.

I understand the left hand was chosen to link this with copyleft, but I so 
wish this were the right hand, because an open right hand signifies somebody 
who is happy to give.

Cheers,
Janani

it depends on perspective. The way I see it is that this is *our*  
conference so the hand being extended is our hand and we are looking  
at the back of the hand - which would be the right hand. So those who  
dont subscribe to the copyleft theory can also look at it this way.  
Now if only we could find a way to add a couple leaves ...

 Solve the matter, use two hands one left and another one right. A
human has two hands.

Er, the marudhaani circle is usually kept in the palm, so it is a bit 
unlikely that this is the back of the right hand that we're seeing.

Have you tried booking tickets with it? I have booked tickets with it in firefox and it is just fine.

Maybe you want to try that first?

yes..

but, http://wiki.linux-delhi.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Main/HallOfShame says,

"When the website puts up an explicit notice that the site will
look-good/work only with a specific proprietary web browser like
Internet Explorer. These will be put up on the list right away without
notice, because these notices are tantamount to policy decisions."

also have a look at,

does 'best viewed' fall under this rule? I dont think it should -  
only when sites advertise that the only work with IE - or when we  
find they only work with IE do they qualify.

I think some time back there was a talk in the thread that there will
be a python subconference during fossconf 08. Is that subconference
going to be there. If so can somebody take ownership for subconference
and file a ticket for it.

Well I have no idea about appliances or commercial software. 

I can however tell you what I know. I have never tried these things but
I can tell you what I have understood.

First and foremost you can only shape outgoing traffic. You cannot do
QoS with incoming traffic. You might be able to manipulate things a
little but you have far more power when it comes to deciding how you
want others to receive packets from you.

This is the basic idea. You can only do traffic shaping with egress
traffic. Not with ingress traffic.

Now, pf + altq can do very sophisticated traffic shaping.

There are three categories of queuing disciples supported by pf.

a ) class based queuing (cbq)

b ) priority based queuing (priq)

c ) hierarchical fair service curve (hfsc)

Each of these mechanisms have pros and cons and you have to pick one of
them based on your requirements.

The configuration for basic QoS management consists of three steps.

1) The altq statement ( which interface to work on , how much bandwidth
you want to play around with and also the queuing discipline (one of
the above)

2) You have to define the "queue" rules to determine how the total
bandwidth in the above line has to be split amongst the various
categories. Typically they are split into multiple queues based on port
numbers but other possibilities also exist. For instance you will want
to allocate bulk of the bandwidth for important mail traffic and
browsing but you want to restrict p2p and other protocols. It is the
"queue" lines that also determine what to do when there is congestion. 
 (IOW most of the tweaking happens here :)

3) Next step is to use the pf filter rules to allocate which queues to
use for handling which traffic

I shall illustrate with an example. This is not my own. I am taking it
from the pf man page.

  1)  altq on dc0 cbq bandwidth 5Mb queue { std, http, mail, ssh }

  2) queue std bandwidth 10% cbq(default)
     queue http bandwidth 60% priority 2 cbq(borrow red) \
           { employees, developers }
     queue  developers bandwidth 75% cbq(borrow)
     queue  employees bandwidth 15%
     queue mail bandwidth 10% priority 0 cbq(borrow ecn)
     queue ssh bandwidth 20% cbq(borrow) { ssh_interactive, ssh_bulk }
     queue  ssh_interactive bandwidth 50% priority 7 cbq(borrow)
     queue  ssh_bulk bandwidth 50% priority 0 cbq(borrow)

 3)  block return out on dc0 inet all queue std
     pass out on dc0 inet proto tcp from $developerhosts to any port 80
\
           keep state queue developers
     pass out on dc0 inet proto tcp from $employeehosts to any port 80 \
           keep state queue employees
     pass out on dc0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 22 \
           keep state queue(ssh_bulk, ssh_interactive)
     pass out on dc0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 25 \
           keep state queue mail

As you can see the first line is the altq directive. You have defined a
list of queues (std, http, mail, ssh) and also mentioned that you want
to use class based queuing.

Then the queue rules determine how individual queues should share the
bandwidth amongst themselves. But we are not quite done yet.

The most critical step is the filter rules that determine when to queue
traffic and which queue to assign to.

That happens in 3). 

It should be self explanatory.

Please note that we have used "pass out" which corresponds to my main
idea of determining how traffic leaves our network.

Once data arrives on the interface, it is already too late to do QoS
manipulation.

This is not completely true (you can do bandwidth throttling) but at
least relatively speaking this idea appears to be correct.

Hope the above explanation suffices.

Can you clarify your needs a bit more?

	(Enumeration)
Message-ID: <15C2CAD382CB69409395ED4F159BED7050EFE9@mail.esntechnologies.co.in>

Dear All,

 

We are looking into the EHCI driver source code in Linux kernel 2.6.14 version. Actually we want to know the function flow at the time of the device connection (i.e. at the time of enumeration phase). For this, we built the Linux image by including the debug statements through printks in EHCI related files in Linux source code (drivers/usb/host). We found that the ehci_start callback method is invoked from usb_hcd_pci_probe method at the time of initialization (when we run modprobe / insmod command). The same we tried to know the name of the method which invokes the ehci_urb_enqueue callback method of the EHCI. We have noticed the following function flow in the /var/log/messages file / through dmesg command after inserting the device into a USB port.

 

ehci_urb_enqueue?qh_urb_transaction ? qtd_fill

   ?submit async ? qtd_append_tds

   ? qh_link_async.

 

We have also noticed that qh_link_async moves filled qheads into asynchronous list  by writing  the command into the EHCI operational register's command register. 

 

We are not able to find the function name that which invokes the ehci_urb_enqueue method. So, could any one please tell/suggest us the function name OR procedure to find out. 

 

Thanks and Regards,

Srinivas G

1. What is your platform?

2. Learn to use lxr.linux.no:

http://lxr.linux.no/ident?i=ehci_urb_enqueue

Depending on the bus to which the host controller is connected, the
corresponding functions are registered. For example, PCI based (2.6
Linux kernel):

http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/usb/host/ehci-pci.c#L354

Follow:

Sorry, this should have been:
http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/usb/core/hcd.c#L921

When you connect the device, root hub port status changes, and
generates hub interrupt request, so usb_submit_urb() should have been
invoked from hub_irq():

hub.c - hub_irq()
http://lxr.linux.no/source/drivers/usb/core/hub.c#L338

Ownership and permissions. Depends on where the php files for squirrelmail
are

Did you install this by hand or did you use an rpm / deb etc?

I know zilch about php, but usualy 'you are not permitted to access  
directory /foo/bar/' error is solved by putting an apache directive  
like:

<Directory /foo/bar/>
       Order deny,allow
       Allow from all
     </Directory>

If he installed squirrelmail from the rpm, it usually adds the right
.htaccess and apache entries for it to function.

Message-ID: <72288b670711120837m4fd78857me3877b54f9c17cd6@mail.gmail.com>

 Hello,

I am using Ubuntu 7.04. I usually keep all my big files in a fat32 drive.

My fat32 paritition (/dev/sda2) is mounted at /media/Media.
here's the fstab entry:
/dev/sda2 /media/Media vfat rw,user,sync 0 3

(my / and /home, both reiserfs, are mounted 1,2)

/media/Media has 3 directories:
Downloads, My\ Music, Videos

In my /home/lvshankar I have 3 sym links to the above 3 directories.

Now, here's my problem. When I mount /dev/sda2 manually from terminal(w/ and
without -o ) or when after the systems boots (which runs mount -a, i guess),
I am not able to write/delete anything in the newly mounted filesystem.
But, when I (re)mount through GParted (right click on /dev/sda2 and say
mount), I am having proper rights. And the owner is show as my user
(lvshankar) account too.

Can anyone help me? And what is GParted exactly doing?

Here's my /etc/fstab
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.

Add 'noauto' and 'users' to your fstab entry.
And if dbus/hal is running, your favourite file manager should automatically mount the storage device with rw permissions
for normal users.
If you want to manually mount the device, check out 'pmount' .

I have been discussing this with various people, potential patrons  
and sponsors. The consensus - and a very strong one - is that the  
left hand is considered inauspicious and should be replaced with a  
right hand. Secondly red and black is too closely identified with the  
Dravidian parties - the whole of Tamilnadu is plastered with red and  
black material - and should be avoided. Orange and black would be ok.  
So i am a very strong -1 about left hand and red/black combination. I  
suggest right hand and orange and black.

 Sir, Did you asked the local priest weather the date and time for the
conference is auspicious or not ? Hope you are avoiding Rahu kalam,
Kal Sarp Yoga, Grahana or any other inauspicious timing/symbols etc.
Also, please announce the Shubh Mahurat for delegates, speakers and
volunteers to enter the venue.

It's not just about auspiciousness. We don't shake hands with the left hand, 
we don't give with the left hand, etc -- except left-handers, common 
practice is to use the right hand!

Ahem - inauspicious? I personally have no problems with a left or right 
hand when it comes to the logo - but I am bothered about the reasons for 
choosing it - we are engaged in spreading science, knowledge and reason 
- as Vivek points out, whether it has any religious significance, 
auspicious/inauspicious ought to be irrelevant.

Are we starting a political party? If not, why should we bothered?

sigh. I used 'auspicious' as an euphemism - it has nothing to do with  
religion. It is based on hygiene. The left hand is used to wipe one's  
bottom, so is unclean. It is an insult to give/receive things with  
the left hand and unhygienic to eat with it

because large number of people will think we chose the colours to  
curry favour with the ruling party

Let us not forget the fact that NRCFOSS is funded government i.e. at
the whims and fancies of politician. The is no point in inviting
petty controversies and loosing our objective - promoting foss. There
is nothing wrong in adhering to some common sentiments shared by
majority - like avoiding left hand etc.

not high time that we start discussing about other things pertaining

Unless the hand is accompanied with a graphic representing a bottom lets not
draw all that kind of imagery

Most people's first inclination will be "cool graphic" - without bothering
about free association with buttocks or political parties, unless someone
drags their mind into that thought stream.

Subject: [Ilugc] LJ Tip: SuperCat
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0711131152390.1017-100000@bharathi.midascomm.com>

LJ Tip: Supercat Text Colorizer

The application Supercat colors any input text based on the type of
file and a set of rules associated with the file type. The rules are
used to match strings found in the input text and can be specified
using simple characters or strings, regular expressions and special
time-formatting rules. Supercat is flexible and extensible; new file
types can be added without software development.

You can download Supercat (at the time of writing the latest version
was 0.5.3) at http://supercat.nosredna.net. Supercat is also available
in Gentoo's portage system and Ubuntu's to-be-released Hardy Heron.
Installing Supercat is fairly straightforward -- the only thing you
need to specify is the --system-directory 'configure' option. Once
installed, you can run Supercat on numerous files. For example:

$> spc file.c

This presents you with a colorized listing (similar to how Vim colors
text). Supercat tries to figure out the file type based on the file
suffix or, in the case of files with the extension .log, Supercat
removes the suffix and looks up the file name (e.g., error.log is file
type error). The user can explicitly override the file type on the
command line.

All rules for colorizing text are stored in files with names of the
form spcrc-ext, where "ext" is the file type. These files are stored
in the configured "system directory" or else your private ~/.spcrc
directory.

All rules for colorizing text are stored in files with names of the
form spcrc-ext, where "ext" is the file type. These files are stored
in the configured "system directory" or else your private ~/.spcrc
directory. For example, the rules for a C source code file in spcrc-c
might look like:

# HTML COL COL A N T CHARACTER, STRING or REGULAR EXPRESSION
########## ### # # # #############################################
Red        red b     ([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)[[:space:]]*(
Yellow     yel b     (while|for|if|switch|main|return)[[:space:]]*(
Yellow     yel b   s else
Cyan       cya     s case
Cyan       cya     s return
Cyan       cya     s default
Cyan       cya b     [[:space:]]*(include)
Green      grn       (do)[[:space:]]*{
Green      grn       (break|continue)[[:space:]]*;
Magenta    mag       (int|char|short|float|double|long|unsigned)[[:space:]]
Blue       blu b     [^[:alnum:]_]([[:digit:]]+)
Yellow     yel       "(.*)"
Yellow     yel       <(.*)>
Magenta    mag     c :;

Matching is performed using the information in the pattern at the end
of each line in the configuration file. If a portion of a line matches
the pattern then the matching characters are given the specified
color. The type of matching is specified in the 'T' column and
defaults to REGEXP.

The other columns specify the video coloring attributes to the used.
"COL" indicates the console color; "A" is an optional video attributes
(e.g., bold, underline); "N" governs the number of times a match is
applied to a line. The "HTML COL" column is there because Supercat
supports outputting its colorized text in HTML format for viewing with
a Web browser.

Supercat provides flexibility and extensibility without requiring
programming. There are numerous other options and goodies that
Supercat has to offer, but I'll let you find them as they are
extensive and out of the scope of this short HOWTO.

Black is considered inauspicious by some people and
the color is only worn during funerals.So I suggest
orange and dark maroon .
If you want to be politically correct in all respects
then we might not be left with a logo at all.

 Bang on, Use left hand to clean the dirty proprietary crap from

on left hand plus suggested color change.

in my project i need to create the executable file in the static library file to be share instead of dynamic ,

iam compiling like this , this is not creating the file with the static library for the file server 

  [root@redhat unix]# ldd server 
            libmysqlclient.so.14 => /usr/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.so.14 (0x00294000)

            /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x009a6000)
    [root@redhat unix]# 
    
    can any one tell how to compile the file to be in the static library files instead of dynamic linking files .

because i need to use the this file , where there is no gcc compiler .

Hi,

I have booked domain linuxsupport.org and install smf forum on
http://www.linuxsupport.org/forum . 

The idea for creating this forum to is to support newbies who are in
desperate need for support. Also I am thinking of online help [ chat ]
support system like HCL , Crafty Syntax Live Help
[http://helpcenterlive.com , http://www.craftysyntax.com/] to be hosted
on this site to support the linux users.  I need volunteers to act as
operator who can provide support to the linux newbie users. 

It's just my thought, if you guys have any better thoughts, ideas please
let me known. 

Also I have booked linuxsupport.in and co.in domains and have sufficient
space and bandwidth to host anything related to Linux/Unix. 

I am not a developer and have little time to spend on web development
and things like that. If anyone has interest to develop and maintain
these sites please let me know. [I will take care of paying $ for the
hosting] 

If anyone need free hosting space of max 50 MB with own cpanel for any
linux / Unix / Open Source Related projects please contact me.

Hi, 


It's the same + online chat help provided by operators [volunteers']. 
Operators will login on their spare time and provide online chat support
for any linux / unix users. So Assuming we have people around the world
volunteering as operators [as support person] we have 24/7 support place
where linux user will get quick support.

Message-ID: <b2600ec40711130210l66364e5fue44b9113933c0ab9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi ,

This is to share my experience with a company called netdomains near guindy
run by Mr.Santhosh.

It is written with just the intention to help the open source developers not
get fooled into certain work practises .

I joined this company as a consultant. It had nothing to call  its business
except for a 3rd party service which they were buying and selling , a
designr who knows html  , no css and no javascrit and one .net developer for
small web contracts that they take.

I was assigned the job to complete 4 projects.

1. Train a new recruit fresher with no idea of opensource  , not any  mvc
framework , no javascript  to make a personal information manager with the
feel of outlook express online.

2.Developement of a control panel which is more user friendly and fully
functional as cpanel from scratch.

3.Develop a website builder

4.Develop a system where all the above integrates.

And besides that , help the .net developer with every doubt that he gets
stuck at.
Make technical documentation(proposal) for new contracts the company
pursues.
Provide solutions for every small project they pursue.

Lots of work . And it was clearly mentioned each one will be done
consequtively.

I was on a payroll.

First month he pays me half of the money and says in few days he will pay
the rest as he is financially week.

Second month , not even half the money.

Then he bring a sorry state and gets me to work without payment for the
remaining months.

The developer whom he recruitted quits  , leaving PIM half way.
She was paid 3000 a month obvious she will quit once she got the knowledge.

Sales guy quits

Front desk lady quits

.net developer quits

I rebuke the .net developer ,asking how can he be so unethical to quit
without prior notice and proper handover.

He informs that his salary was just 4000 rupees and even that was not paid
regularly.
The same guy now works for 32k a month in a different company.
The same guy brings me to light of the companies former practises , how
before me someone else was doing things and they were not paid too.


A new sales guy was recruited  for 30k a month who quit his job in NIS.

End of the month he is not paid too.

When I ask my payment , the man says I am expensive for him .
So he would like to put development  on hold till things turn good.

Then after 1 week he makes a peanut 5k payment and says you have to help us
finsinh the projects , so that we can pay your pending amounts.

Now he wants me to help him for free , not even as debit .. for me to get my
pending payments.

Out of pure pity I accept to dedicate 4 hours every week to just give
guidance to his new recruit  developer for free.
He  sends a statement saying he owes me 75k and wil be paid soon.

After 1 week , he calls me and says something has to be done to develop
things.

I tell him , anymore support from me would require payment in advance .

He currently mails me saying that I dont deserve the money and I need
to complete the above mentioned projets to get payment.

I was  on  a payroll .
Few of the projects were done more than once and totally scrapped off ,
becasue he came up with totally new requirments.

I have an agreement signed by him before I joined work.

Should I pass it on to my family lawers is still something I am speculating
on.



Moral of the story:

1. When on payroll and a salary is not paid in full on the appointed date -
QUIT. th first month.

2. Kindly consider and get payments in advance for your own good before
doing anything for netdomains.

ok - thats done. The next priority is to produce a brochure. Why a  
brochure? Because we are planning to approach people who have never  
experienced a FOSS conference before - government employees, college  
lecturers, research scientists, systems administrators. Also we need  
a brochure for getting sponsors and to submit to the Ministry to get  
funds. I would suggest a three panel A-4 thing that can be printed on  
a desktop printer also. We will be printing in a regular printer too.  
A draft of the brochure is up at:

http://registration.fossconf.in/code/wiki/ConferenceBrochure

please polish this up. And it is not necessary that Niyam does  
everything. Once the logo is out and the colours known, everyone can  
make posters, brochures, banners etc.

And by tomorrow everyone will be back from diwali vacation, and we  
can get down to serious work.

Thanks for the info and making us more aware.
And good luck to you, hope you get your payments and that unscrupulous
person gets his due punishment.

We also found that the flow is almost same in 2.6.14 version. As you said in your mail, the invoking flow is same.

By the way, please let us know the procedure for building the ehci-hcd.ko file whenever there is a modification to the files existing in the USB/CORE directory. We want to put some debug statements in the hub.c file for reference purpose and then build & load the ehci-hcd.ko file.

That is Linux kernel version. By platform, I meant target platform -

Well, you can setup lxr locally on your 2.6.14 code base.

If you enable them as module (M) in the kernel config, simply doing
make in the kernel sources will re-build them, and you can transfer
just the modules on the target platform, and test them.

If you make them built-in to the kernel, you will need to re-install
the kernel, and use it during every test.

I have used cscope extensively on massive code trees. I am curious to know
how it compares to lxr - apart from the obvious difference of graphical user
interface.

Can someone who has used both critically comment on the strenghts of the
two? For the Linux Kernel, does lxr offer any special benefits?

Friends,

I am the culprit here, for giving intro of Santhosh, Net Domains to
Antono. I alarmed Antono to stop the work after hearing that santhosh
never paid him right after the second month of the contract.  I
believe the deal went on with ice candy words and the castle on the
air promised by santhosh to antono.

Any way i also learnt a lesson for dealing with such painful
customers. Guys black list these kind of companies as they take our
time and effort for a happy ride.

Not so simple.

I am not defending the behaviour of Netdomains. However, I guess it is
more to do with incompetence of the CEO/Owner than deliberate
cheating. The guy really did not know how to convert the work of
employees into useful software/service for the clients and collect
payment and pay salaries.

My point is, it might not have been a happy ride for Mr. Santhosh.

Having said that, I agree that at the end of the day, it is the
management's responsibility to pay the salary as agreed. If the above
revenue stream is not there, the promoter/owner has the responsibility
to beg/borrow and pay salaries on time in full.

Well I am also part of the circle in bringing out this. Mr.Santhosh
contacted me few days back, I asked Raja and in turn Raja suggested
Antano, then I asked Antano. And well the world is circular after
all.

It is written with just the intention to help the open source developers not
get fooled into certain work practises .

I joined this company as a consultant. It had nothing to call  its business
except for a 3rd party service which they were buying and selling , a
designr who knows html  , no css and no javascrit and one .net developer for
small web contracts that they take.

I was assigned the job to complete 4 projects.

1. Train a new recruit fresher with no idea of opensource  , not any  mvc
framework , no javascript  to make a personal information manager with the
feel of outlook express online.

2.Developement of a control panel which is more user friendly and fully
functional as cpanel from scratch.

3.Develop a website builder

4.Develop a system where all the above integrates.

And besides that , help the .net developer with every doubt that he gets
stuck at.
Make technical documentation(proposal) for new contracts the company
pursues.
Provide solutions for every small project they pursue.

Lots of work . And it was clearly mentioned each one will be done
consequtively.

I was on a payroll.

First month he pays me half of the money and says in few days he will pay
the rest as he is financially week.

Second month , not even half the money.

Then he bring a sorry state and gets me to work without payment for the
remaining months.

The developer whom he recruitted quits  , leaving PIM half way.
She was paid 3000 a month obvious she will quit once she got the knowledge.

Sales guy quits

Front desk lady quits

.net developer quits

I rebuke the .net developer ,asking how can he be so unethical to quit
without prior notice and proper handover.

He informs that his salary was just 4000 rupees and even that was not paid
regularly.
The same guy now works for 32k a month in a different company.
The same guy brings me to light of the companies former practises , how
before me someone else was doing things and they were not paid too.


A new sales guy was recruited  for 30k a month who quit his job in NIS.

End of the month he is not paid too.

When I ask my payment , the man says I am expensive for him .
So he would like to put development  on hold till things turn good.

Then after 1 week he makes a peanut 5k payment and says you have to help us
finsinh the projects , so that we can pay your pending amounts.

Now he wants me to help him for free , not even as debit .. for me to get my
pending payments.

Out of pure pity I accept to dedicate 4 hours every week to just give
guidance to his new recruit  developer for free.
He  sends a statement saying he owes me 75k and wil be paid soon.

After 1 week , he calls me and says something has to be done to develop
things.

I tell him , anymore support from me would require payment in advance .

He currently mails me saying that I dont deserve the money and I need to
complete the above mentioned projets to get payment.

I was  on  a payroll .
Few of the projects were done more than once and totally scrapped off ,
becasue he came up with totally new requirments.

I have an agreement signed by him before I joined work.

Should I pass it on to my family lawers is still something I am speculating
on.



Moral of the story:

1. When on payroll and a salary is not paid in full on the appointed date -
QUIT. th first month.

2. Kindly consider and get payments in advance for your own good before
doing anything for netdomains.

I recently bought an acer laptop which comes preloaded with linux. I
had spent 38000 on the laptop. But the linux which came preloaded is
just a simple version. You can format the harddisk and install ubuntu
on that.

I too have one.. But the hardware is very cheap, and not reliable..
After some time my optical drive stopped working, and my cpu fan
developed problems.. I plan to replace it with a Thinkpad. If you can
afford a bit, TP's are the way to go...

Message-ID: <4739C447.6030700@efyindia.com>

Hi,

Are you working on any free software or open source (FOSS) project? Do 
you know anyone who is?

There's a great opportunity for all Indian FOSS contributors to showcase 
their work at the national level, and perhaps global too! Plus, the 
development team (or individual) can get a minimum cash prize of Rs 25,000!

But, there's more to it than just cash prize. The winners will get 
exclusive coverage in LINUX For You magazine, and openITis.com (aka 
linuxforu.com). Which in turn could mean: (a) more media coverage for 
the project and its developers, (b) publicity amongst targeted 
customers, and (c) more contributors getting attracted to the project.

Launched with an initial kitty of Rs 5 lakhs, the FOSS India Awards aim 
to recognise India's top 20 FOSS projects. The LINUX For You team is 
working with FOSII (Forum for Open Source Initiatives in India) on this 
venture.

The registration for FOSS India Awards is FREE! All one has to do to 
register is to visit http://www.openitis.com/awards/ and fill in the 
two-minute form. Registration for FOSS India Awards is open till 15th 
December '07. The awards will be announced during Open Source India Week 
(aka LinuxAsia 2008) during the 2nd week of February '08.

Please do forward this message to anyone whom you believe is working on 
a FOSS project, and is a good candidate.

Let's prove to the World that India contributes to FOSS too...

Best Wishes!
LINUX For You team

I used Acer Aspire 5602 with Debian Etch and Ubuntu 7.04. Acer Aspire`s
soundcard didnot work with the default kernel ( 2.6.18) of Etch; but 7.04 of
Ubuntu was good enough. I sold that some days ago and bought a Sony Vaio
VGN-C50HB and loaded and running Gutsy here; and believe me or not...it is
some sorta super computer. :)
I really love the combination of Vaio+Ubuntu 7.10.

Because it was put forward as installing cpanel initially , then a change in
the look and then he brings out his intention of a totally new control
panel. Anyway what I finally agreed with him was to install ispconfig - open
source control panel and modify source to meet his requirments in phases and
at later stages he will have to add people to further modify  ispconfig.
Infact we have already done some of that . I had helped him s et up a
reseller setup with ispconfig on a vps. Customized to the way he wanted it ,
branded it with netdomains logo and such.

companies website address is www.netdomains.in

The work which I was doing and the sites hosted after that were done with
www.instantsitemagic.com

I told him he can pay it to me even next year.
Or he can pay me his debts as 5000 each month.
But I got irritated when he changed his commitment.
He agrees he owes me so much expecting that he will get work.
He is reluctant to give post dated cheques even for the next year or as
minimal installments.

And when insisted he says he needs help to raise funds .

When declined he says I need to complete all the above mentioned projects to
justify payment.

dear all,

a) please tell me where may i publish the source files for your free use.

b) have noted the brochure ticket. while all of us try to do that,
would also like to create buttons and banners. so for that, may i
request a slogan/theme. since this is my third reminder, perhaps i
should start by recommending a slogan. if you don't like it, recommend
changes. if you don't, i'll author the buttons and banner with this
slogan:

"Share Knowledge With Open Hands"

looks ok to me. No harm in having more than one slogan. btw, can the  
thamizh guys please create tamil version of all this?

re copyright. As far as I know, the copyright to a conference logo  
should belong to the conference. Further, it cannot be 'shared' under  
some license as the use of the same should be restricted to  
situations relevant to the conference. That is, the logo can only be  
used for conference publicity materials, and if it is used on any  
website, the same must link back to the conference website.  
Similarly, no one can modify or distribute the logo without approval  
of the copyright owners - and such modification and distribution can  
only be done to further the aims of the conference. As such the only  
possible modifications would be changing the city name and date for  
future conferences or changing the language of the text. You have  
much more experience in these fields, so how would you like to deal  
with this?

I disagree - what about startups where you join two other guys in a  
garage and it winds up as google? Writing is irrelevant (I *am* a  
lawyer), work with people you trust. Who to trust? That comes with  
experience

He who never takes risks never gets anywhere. Learn to whom to give  
extended credit.

Er, Larry / Sergey knew each other from Stanford (correct me if I'm wrong).

If J.Random "Webhost" with a hole in the wall office comes to you on the
basis that he is a friend of a friend of a friend .. you do need to be more
careful than that.

it's binding - even if it is not in writing. But in practice, in my  
career as a lawyer, I have almost always advised clients in these  
situations to cut their losses and move on. Take the most common  
contract - you take a newb and make him sign a bond undertaking to  
work for at least two years after his training is over or forfeit  
some sum of money. He gets trained and scoots. What do you do?  
Legally you can sue him - practically speaking its better to cut the  
losses and move on. In the instant case, although the OP has a cast  
iron case, the employer doesnt have the money to pay him. So if he  
sues, the only people who will profit are the lawyers.

By saying that whether the contract is in writing or not is  
irrelevant, I mean that in the last analysis sincerity of the parties  
and their willingness (and ability) to keep to the agreement are far  
more important than mere promises - whether written or oral.

I could not update the contents of the brochure wiki, tried twice and
on both occassions, evan after waiting for ~05 minutes, no updates.

Hence, am posting my changes below. Would someone, kindly update the
wiki accordingly.

==========================================

= FossConf Chennai feb08 =

The Indian Linux Users Group, Chennai Chapter (ILUGC), in association
with NRC-FOSS, Chennai takes great pleasure in inviting you to
participate in the FossConf to be held at MIT, Chromepet, Chennai from
noon on 01 Feb, 2008 to noon on 03 Feb, 2008.

== THE ORGANISERS ==

ILUGC is one of the oldest lugs in the country and has been
continously active since it was founded. It keeps a low profile and
specialises in grass roots work all around TamilNadu (and in the
neighbouring states too). Under it's guidance, many lugs are active in
colleges and towns all around TamilNadu. At the same time, Chennai LUG
members are in the forefront of the FOSS movement both at the national
and international level.

NRC-FOSS, a Central Government Project, funded by the DIT and jointly
run by CDAC and AU-KBC Research Centre, Chennai, for the past two and
half years has been actively promoting FOSS in the academic domain.
It's main focus has been getting FOSS introduced into the curriculum
of Engineering Colleges in the country. Also, apart from encouraging
student projects in FOSS, it has been active in encouraging academia
to release it's work under FOSS/Creative Commons licenses. AU-KBC
Research Centre, MIT, Chennai has strengths in NLP, Bio-informatics,
Wireless, Cryptography and embedded computing, much of which utilizes
FOSS tools and has released some of this research material as FOSS.

== SCOPE ==

The conference will focus on both, new users / contributors to FOSS.
It will help improve their skills and give them experience in speaking
and presenting on their subject.

efficient servers and networks
 * For academic researchers: a new arena to present your research and
contribute back to the people who gave you your FOSS research tools
 * For FOSS developers: a chance to share your knowledge with the new
generation and to interact with your friends around the country

== Programs ==

 * Talks - 45 minutes each on every conceivable foss related topic
 * Mini talks - 10 minutes each, on some aspect of foss
 * Tutorials - upto 2 hours of intense instruction on a particular subject
 * Sprints - groups of people working to achieve some target - coding,

If it's not too late to suggest changes, I think "chennai" can be done 
in flag-color green. Gives a little bit of India flavor to the logo. 
Kindly consider capitalizing 'c' in chennai and 'f' in feb.

this is good - I suggest it be printed as a supplement to the  
specific conference brochure. I have created a ticket - http:// 
registration.fossconf.in/code/ticket/10. Can someone with DTP  
knowledge accept the ticket and do the job? Once the english version  
is ready, we can translate it. For those who do not know the history  
of the brochure, it was developed over a period of months by the  
Mumbai LUG after intense debate to accomodate all schools of thought.

I thought  bonds to work for x years are not valid in India.

Anyway for my case , I have my appointment letter and was on payroll and not
on contract and we had one month notification agreement.And I agree with
kenneth that even when you are legally strong, it is at most times not worth
the effort(from the cases that I hear from a few lawyers I know).

there are two types of bond - one, you join a company and sign a bond  
saying you will work for at least three years - this was never valid

two - join a company where they quantify the training they are going  
to give you and you undertake to work for X years or refund the money  
spent on you - valid. They still cant make you work if you dont want  
to, but they can sue you for the money spent on your training - if  
they can prove they spent it. And prove they trained you.

tell me this,

i put papers and they told me that they can relieve me only after 90 days 
simply citing some company rules..

and there was no work also.. i quit on my own in a months time..

and many of my friends are waiting for 90 days to complete.. 

is it valid?

i can tell them if it is not possible.. they can raise their voice..

just some guesses,

what is http://localhost returning?

are you running it as a normal user? 

why not try starting the browser as a root user and try http://localhost/mail

what does it return then?

What's your relieving period mentioned in the employment agreement? 

If it 90 days you have to wait till that time. One exception is take count of no of leaves that you have and minus it with the notice period date. 

You will get the exact days which need to spend or calculate the basic salary for those days and pay it and get relieved on the same day.

Vijai .G

tell me this,

i put papers and they told me that they can relieve me only after 90 days 
simply citing some company rules..

and there was no work also.. i quit on my own in a months time..

and many of my friends are waiting for 90 days to complete.. 

is it valid?

i can tell them if it is not possible.. they can raise their voice..

Hi all!

I am a Computer Sc. & Engineering Undergrad student and will graduate in
June, 2008. I am interested in working for a organization which has
*Open Source* on its agenda. Its not necessary that the employees
eat-drink-sleep Open Source , but yes, they are encouraged to spend
their time on Open Source software. Ideally, there should be a link
'Open Source ' on the organization's homepage. Positions I am interested
in :

* Developers/Programmers
* Consultant
* Technical Writer

or all three :-)

Okay, this does not sound like a job seeker;s preferences. But, its
actually the kind of organization I am looking for. Sun, Google are
still distant dreams for me. 

My homepage is available at [1] and my blog at [2]

Please contact me off-list at amitsaha.in@gmail.com

I would really appreciate any kind of help!

Thanks. Nautilus automatically mounts the partition when I try to open it.
But, all my media is in this parition. W/o me mounting it, my audio player

Hi All ,

I have a triple boot system (Win98, Debian 4.0, Ubuntu7.10) with 80GB HDD, 256 MB RAM.

I purchased a Sony DVD Writer today (technical name recognised in windows given above). I did not have any hope of this DVD RW being recognised in Win98. But when I booted into Debian, through the messages scrolling I could see the DVD RW message scrolling (/dev/hdc).
When I put a Dual layer DVD into this drive , the DVD was not reading. ( mount /media/cdrom1 ---- no medium found ) Since it was not reading, I did not venture into burning a DVD with this. I googled for Drivers for this DVD Writer. All I got was the shopping details of this DVD Writer without any driver details.
Same case in Ubuntu 7.10 also. I thought the  linux distros being very recent, the DVD writer should work out of the box, but it did not. What is wrong ? 
Is there any hope of reading dual layer dvd's in linux with this drive ? Or should I consider Rs 1400 as gone down the drain?
Any help is welcome.

Sidux is also a very nice variant of debian , which I have been using lately
and found it to be very food.It install in 7 minutes in a single core pc
with full kde applications.And the live cd boots faster than any other I
have tried.Sidux is debian unstable made stable.

You can add a mount command to your autostart file.
A simple 'pmount <dev> MMEDIA' would be sufficient.
The location of the autostart file is dependant on the desktop environment you use.
I am assuming you use KDE - so check in ~/.kde .
If you want an environment agnostic solution, add the mount command to /etc/rc.local .

HTH.

Is that a SATA drive?

I have it working wonderfully under gentoo.

But under OpenBSD they do not work.

I am surprised that linux distros you mention do not work.

Have you tried downloading and compiling the latest kernel?

I don't think your money went down the drain. Definitely not.

Even I don't think so. :)

I plan to fix the OpenBSD drivers some day...

And of course pretty soon hardware support will follow in the open
source world.

HTH,

join NRC-FOSS. Why join when the pay sucks?

1. We eat-drink-sleep Open Source
2. You get to choose what projects you want to work on
3. You can concurrently do your MS by research or PhD
4. It looks damn good on your resume
5. Just after graduation is the right time to take a couple of years  
off to do what you *really* want to do before pursuing the god of

6. And, although it sounds old-fashioned and uncool, your country

I have already secured a job in one of them and kind of well acquainted with the _great_ work they 
dish out for freshers. Hence, I am seeking such FOSS opportunities and with God's grace will be able to find one.

Hi,

I feel, approaching Colleges is the need of the hour.  I have some of my
friends working as HOD in an engineering college in Karur.  I have already
conveyed to them.  If necessary, we can push through them, through
appropriate means.
Regards,

excellent - that *is* the need of the hour. Colleges, both students

 Looks like there is some problem with your touchpad. Try disabling
the touch pad and login to X.

 Also, i think some extra packages are required in ubuntu 7.10, for
the touch pad to work properly.

Is that an exam question?  If so grep sed and awk if you want to replace
stuff INSIDE the file with some other text.

Are we going with the name FossConf.in ? I ask this because I can see
the logo (top left) in this http://registration.fossconf.in/code/ page
which says so.

If we are not going to call this event FossConf.in, I suggest we can
better remove the logo from the wiki for the time being, till we get
the completed logo.

First impressions:

1. Not sure who/why they are running, but, on first glance it looks
like a banner for some marathon!

2. Always use sans-serif for headings. Title/headings should not have
styles or features that make it difficult to read.

Imagine a conference poster put-up on the back of a public bus. While
the bus is moving, at first glance, people should be able to grasp as
much info as possible from the poster; not spend time just trying to
decipher the name of the conference.

3. Avoid regional languages, unless it is a focused conference only to
a particular region or group of people. People who don't understand
the phrases may not give in to it easily, or simply won't care.

4. Keep it simple.

Why we should avoid Tamil (or any other language) at all cost? After
all the language of this place is Tamil.

If we are only worrying about people who don't understand Tamil, what
about the population who does not understand English? I guess no of
students able to understand Tamil will be far greater than those who
can understand only English.

I am not trying to start an argument. But just letting out my
frustration. Thanks.

anbudan,

before answering a mail, please read what Shakthi wrote. If you want  
only people who know a particular language to attend the conference,  
then use that language. If you want outsiders to come, then avoid  
specific languages.

I read that Kenneth. Is the conference only meant for those who know
English (a particular language)? Then fair enough.

I think there could be 2 versions of the banner. One in tamil to
attract the local crowd and another 1 in english.

ahh. You may have noticed a request on this list to translate the  
logo and slogans into tamil. No one has responded to it so far. In my  
opinion, the logo on the website and posters as well as slogans etc  
should be in english for the english version of the site/posters and  
in Tamil for the tamil version. The registration website is  
bilingual. Talks can be in either language, and, if we want to reach  
our target audience, most of the publicity material must also be in  
Tamil. The whole problem is finalising the logo. We thought is was  
finalised, but again apprehensions of physical danger from wearing a  
conference T shirt have been raised, so the logo is still not fully  
finalised. But even then, we need lots of slogans both in English and  
tamil. We need the conference brochure, both in english and tamil -  
none of this work has even been commenced in Tamil though we are well  
on the way with the English versions.

The Mumbai brochure mentioned in ticket: http:// 
registration.fossconf.in/code/ticket/10 is the result of nearly two  
months of hard work balancing the viewpoints of both the OSS people  
and the GNU people, and many people from Chennai participated in  
formulating it. It is an excellent piece of work and needs to be  
urgently translated and made part of the conference publicity  
material. So let's move on

Name of a conference is the first impression that people get.

If I were to conduct a conference in Chennai with the name "FOSSConf

know about either.

Similarily, if I were to conduct a conference in Poland with the name
"FOSSConf ?????? ", nobody will attend for the same reason.

When you go global, marketing and localization are two separate entities.

I understand we are conducting this meet in chennai. And official language
for Chennai is **Tamil**
Its pity that so much argument has to happen even to include the states
official language :(

If the conf is in China or honkong, definitely some chinese letters will
creep in.

If English is the business language, do you think we can scrap all the other
languages from this world ???

Or do you think technology should not be given in Tamil.
Why do you think now organisations like ICANN promote international domain
names.?

I think we are unnecessarily creating issue out of this.

 If you want to search files and replace content inside files then
search for a perl script named "rpl" (it is available as package under
debian though.

This kinda popped up into my head while listening to Pink Floyd's Echoes:

``As illumination through reflection, knowledge is nurtured by sharing.''

In no way does it make a good slogan yet. Needs modifications. But the idea is 
to have some kind of a link to the `Sunny' side of the logo and mix it up 
with the knowledge sharing part.

Cheers.

the name is:

Chennai feb08  <--------- second line

this will not hurt anyone's feelings. Only question is, will it scale?

1. Sorry about my outbursts. Yesterday was a long day and I was fed up
with more than one thing :-).

2. I did not take up any responsibilities, for the conference date
directly clashes with the most significant day of the year for the
industry I am involved in.

Since no one has taken up the translation task, I volunteer to
co-ordinate translating all the publicity material into Tamil for the
conference.

3. Shakthi, I know how much you want Open Source to spread into the
schools and colleges of Tamil Nadu. You have more experience dealing
with students than many of us.

In our company, I work with CS graduates from small towns, whose
biggest barrier to becoming a good software engineer is language. They
are no less in problem solving or analytical skills, but English
comprehension is a barrier. Should we not give students like that the
exposure?

My point is, since the focus is on local participation, let us have
Tamil banners, promotion material also. Come to think of it, with
volunteers for other languages joining in, we can have banners etc in
Telugu, Malayalam and Hindi also. Number of Telegu speaking students
is significant in Chennai.

4. Amachu, in my opinion having a Tamil sub-conference will be
counter-productive. Communicate the message to the students in Tamil
and have them take part in the main conference.

anbudan,

Ma Sivakumar

it is unfortunately true that english fluency is a must for a foss  
programmer. Windows people can get away without english fluency - at  
the cost of writing crap. I dont like this, the French dont like it,  
but it is inevitable. We can use local languages for publicity, but  
in the last analysis, unless a person masters English, he will not  
excel as a programmer. The problem is that when people master  
English, they forget their local language and become strangers in  
their own country.

I agree here. A tamil subconference can talk about foss, can  
contribute documentation and translation - but cannot contribute  
code. And if our conference does not produce code, and coders, it  
will be a failure.

Is the conference only going to be about how to code and develop foss
packages. Are we not going to target endusers also.

enduser of foss is not a passive monkey - he is an active participant  
in the development of foss. If you had taken the trouble to read the  
call for participation, you would have noticed that we *are*  
targeting the endusers, with a view to bringing them to the next  
level. And now someone is going ask - 'is the conference only going  
to be about endusers? Are we not going to target the developers?'

I thought the decision to use niyam's logo was taken already!! Or did I miss
some intervening communication?

looks good. One tree is enough. Make it bigger with the penguin  
underneath. At present there is no shade for the penguin. One, nice  
big Indian tree that extends into the sky would be good. Rocks are  
not needed. Uniform colour for the sky. (we have to cut down on  
colours). And the lettering should be:

FossConf    <------------first line

Chennai Feb08  <---------- second line, the width of the two lines  
should be the same. It is looking good in small size.

the problem is many more people are worried about the closeness of  
the logo to various party symbols and are nervous about the effect on  
the conference and attendance. Logo is not all that important, so it  
would be better to have something totally free of controversy. This  
is especially true for the interior parts of TN where we want to do  
the most publicity.

try this - create a table in a database with name as varchar of  
length 5. And try to insert ???????? into it - it will  
fail. Please also check the length of the same word in c, c++, perl,  
java, lua, haskell, php, visual basic, C# and see what comes out.  
Also try similar words in kannada, telugu, hindi. Then investigate  
how these languages calculate the length of a string. You will find  
that you will also need Tamil hardware to make your logic work. You  
are trying to make the sun rise in the west ;-)

This the price we pay for the broken implementation of Tamil unicode.
Indic rendering is a battle to be won application by application.

AM sorry to say it, but IMHO the objections are frivolous. And to think this
will affect conf attendance is stretching it too far. One can always find
some fault with any logo.

In trying to please everyone a nice logo is being given the go by. Am afraid
something insipid will replace it. That will surely affect attendance.

 Well good point you have raised here and this is not first time I am
seeing such a frivolous excuses are given by guys in this country.
 On one hand organizers claim that they are trying to build a
*national* conference and on the other hand they are giving stupid
reasons for not selecting a logo. First the left hand was
*inauspicious* because it is used to clean the bottom. Now the right
hand has issues because   it remotely resembles some political party.
 Man is there an end to such kiddish skepticism ?

Moreover, it makes me wonder is it worth doing any hard work for any
lug or FOSS group ? Even if you do good work, some idiot will come and
throw water over it, citing some superstition.

 I dont know when FOSS guys will start looking at the unfortunate
state of things we are heading towards.

What you choose w.r.t to contribution to do is your prerogative. Given 
the context, I think you calling those carrying the can names. Not at 
all fair and completely unjustified.

I think a decorum needs to be maintained and while one has the freedom 
to express, it certainly does not extend to abuse or name calling. 
Frustration or past bad experiences in no way justifies your classifying 
what you see here as idiocy.

Brief glimpse of the mail in tamil.

We gad a small discussion. Elango of MIT, myself and Shankar. 

Two things came out.

as an advocacy and awareness,

1) Calling for essays from schools and colleges from students on what is FOSS 
and its related topics.

The topics can be dynamic. Like for a Law College Students it can be

"The perils of Software Patents"

and for schools it can be

"Why we need free software for schools"

Elango can step into this job with few other students.

2) IT industry how to approach and harness its resources atleast few. if 
interested some small team can be formed with shankar for this.

Feedbacks?

> Need some constructive criticism

it is better if we develop a practise if some initiates something he
can give a name for it, a logo for it etc., and every one respect.

it can built on any good logic/ belief he possess.

remember, debian is combination of a man's name and his wife's name.

the initiator can be given credit. this will minimize un-necessary sounds.

so niyam's logo is going to be there? or is it going to grow further?

in such a huge conference, above all there will be lot of things,
where we can find a place for have left hand, black shirts, red
fedoras etc.,

everything can be found a place in it.

Hi All,

Firstly I must frankly state is that "things are being taken a bit too far".
Niyam's logo is brilliant IMO. If someone is foolish enough to
consider a hand (it is not even actually representing the party symbol
by no means as it varies by way too much) it to be some party stuff
and hence not attend, I would be happy about him not attending.
May be you can use the new logoin banners and stuff if
The statement "Logo is not that important" is another "stupid"
statement. The logo actually goes all along the way in the coming
years if at all this is planned to be a annual event and that becomes
some kind of a Brand for the conf.

I am afraid there is more politics here being created, assumed,
discussed and wasted time upon than what actually might be there.
Another question is Are you looking at only attendance? Then you can
very well go to the beach (Marina) or even better (Besant NagAnd
another view is that the current Logo is no way close to the quality
and meaning of Niyam's logo. May be I am wrong and thats just my POV.
Can someone illustrate what the logo actually means? the stamp, the
seal etc?
ar beach, you get good crowd there too ;-)) and start speaking. You
get loads of attendance!

Looks like the organisers must re think their goals and motives or
make the statement clear as to what exactly they are looking at.

Again I say, Niyam's logo is too good to be trashed!

Reggies.

I think it will not be possible to create a logo which appeals to
everybody and does not create any controversy.

I am really sorry to advice at this point when the final version of the Foss
Chennai logo is decided.

The wordings "INDIA"  are written in the vertical direction. Can we have it
placed horizontal direction and a bit bolder too.

Message-ID: <d16b1c80711170940t3a538d45l8963f3ef581933a4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

A one-day embedded/VLSI Free/Open Source workshop at BMS College of
Engineering, Bengalooru (Bangalore), Karnataka was organized today,
Saturday, November 17, 2007.

I handled embedded, system architecture concepts, Linux device
drivers, OpenMoko introduction topics. Aanjhan addressed FOSS EDA
tools, verilog, embedded GNU/Linux labs HOWTO et. al.

http://www.bmsce.ac.in/

I would like to thank Shashank Bharadwaj for working with me during
the past few weeks in coordinating/organizing the event.

* Students were mostly from EEE/ECE background.

According to the few interested students:

* The institution management are quite willing to help/invest for the
students, but, very few takers for it.

* There are few permanent faculty, who rotate the courses that they
teach every semester. But, most of them move/prefer the Industry.

* Neither faculty nor students are very serious about exams. Day
before the exams, frequently asked questions (not FAQs!) are given to
students, and they are given freedom to write answers to questions of
their choice.

* Lab exercises are very primitive.

* In some colleges, professors collect e-mails of all students, and
send previous project code to them, asking them to change author name,
re-compile code, and submit them! Neither faculty nor students are
very concerned.

During the workshop, I did emphasize on the need to use FOSS tools to
enhance their skills, and get exposure to the Industry, FOSS
community, and the real world.

his thesis is that there are 247 letters in the Tamil alphabet. 12  
vowels, 18 consonants and the rest combination of vowels and  
consonants - this is a little less than other indic languages as the  
others have more consonants. He feels that one uniocde number be  
allotted to each of these 247 letters. That is separate numbers for  
ka kA ki kI ku kU  etc. Currently only 20 numbers are allotted and  
the rest are a combination of these. He further states that this  
'mistake' is due to clubbing of Tamil with other indic languages. How  
exactly Tamil is different is not elaborated.

Hi,

Is anyone using (g)vim for writing and debugging programs in gcc using
gdb? I tried using GDBVIM. I am not that impressed by it.

I would ideally need a gdb integration in VIM/GVIM, so that I can
debug C programs like turbo C++ IDE or Eclipse or M$'s visual studio.

Any pointers will be highly appreciated.

Thanks!

Kenneth,

Keyboard layout is different from Character encoding. Tamil keyboard
layout will remain the same. But internally each of the 247 tamil
letters will have separate slots so that sorting, character count etc
need not be a hack (as being the requirement now).

In tamil there are only 12 vowels and 18 consonants. The corresponding
numbers for Hindi is 14 and 68 (correct the no.s). Total combination
characters for Hindi would be somewhere around 1000 compared to 247
for Tamil.

anbudan,

Ma Sivakumar

sorting in Tamil is b0rked because the wrong order has been given for  
some letters in the unicode scheme. Character count is correct,  
because the current unicode scheme allots more than one character for  
all the consonant-vowel combinations.

in kannada, telugu, not only do they combine vowel+consonant, but  
also consonant+consonant. So according to the proposed scheme the  
kannada word kshathriya would be only 2 characters long - ksha and  
thriya.

Since all Indian languages face the same problem (I dont know about  
urdu and kashmiri), there is a need for a common solution.

Hmm, this isn't a good practice in FOSS. Is it?

I guess the licenses of "previous project code" are
also not specified by the original authors?

So, Freedom 0, 1 and 3 must be encouraged over 2 in
colleges.[1] Because, 2 is exercised, often with
violation of the license :) (and may be in this case)

They didn't know that they need to put a header in source files
containing author name, copyright, year, license information.

Even though they were projects, it is essential that they know all these.

The only good advantage for students that I see is that they are not
given heavy work, assignments, lab work et. al. This gives the
students lot of free time, wherein if they have the desire and
passion, they can really spend time with FOSS, and acquire lot of
skills and knowledge. As always, 5% of any class are only active.

while there are certainly common grounds between all these bharathiya
languages, i think solutions can be obtained if we think each one them
independently.

its really difficult for me to worry about the needs of hindi, kannada
etc., while i would certainly like the problems in them also getting
solved..

please seperate each language, think about them independently, as they
exists in each state independently. that will help in bringing out a
solution for all..

there are common areas, like the inscript keyboard. but in my opinion,
these need to caught and tried as exceptions. ;-)

I understand that is because all Indian languages where given same ordering.

I am not an expert on this. That is to limit the number of characters
needed for a language. If the total characters in a language is within
reasonable limit, is it not more logical to have separate slots?

Message-ID: <ad2a4f6d0711180337k3b7569d3m983c37cd32fdd77d@mail.gmail.com>

Illustration of
One difference between Tamil script & other major indian scripts
and its implications for encoding.

. No conjuncts in Tamil
  conjunct
    = samyukta akshara (in hindi/sanskrit/many other indian languages)
    = 2 consonants (shapes) coming together to form a different 3rd shape

Example 1: consider
ng + ka -> _ngka_ =
?? + ? -> _???_ (devanaagarii) =
?? + ? -> _???_ (tamil).
In devanaagarii, 2 shapes ( ??  followed by ?) goes to form ???  (a
different shape not found in the set of base vowels & consonants).
However in Tamil, the corresponding 2 shapes (?? followed by ?) still gives ???
(no change in shapes).

Example 2: consider
t + ra -> _tra_ =
?? + ? -> _???_ (devanaagarii) =
?? + ? -> _???_ (tamil)
(again a shape change in devanaagarii and none in tamil)

. So rough estimate of unique shapes in
  - Devanaagarii :
       vowels+anusvaara+visarga(15)*consonants(33)+
       consonants(33)*consonants(33)
    = 1584[+]
  - Tamil : vowels(12) * consonants(18)
    = 216

. So implication for encoding:
  considerably lesser space (factor of 7)
  to encode ALL shapes of Tamil than Devanaagarii.

[+] Assuming only 2 consonant conjuncts and all combinations being valid
(in practice there are can be 3 and 4 consonant conjuncts and
 not all combinations of consonants are valid)

Sorry for the late reply.
Am on Gutsy/Gnome. I added 'pmount /dev/sda2 MMEDIA' to my /etc/rc.local.
No effect. And I have sym links to some directories in the partition in my
/home. Which don't work unless I open the partition from nautilus or have
mounted it already. Any go. In short I want the partition to mount
automatically when my system boots and I should have write permissions to
it. I have only one user a/c on my box. So even if what you suggest will
work for just one user, its fine with me.

 Looks like there is some problem with your touchpad. Try disabling
the touch pad and login to X.

How to disable the touchpad? 

 Also, i think some extra packages are required in ubuntu 7.10, for
the touch pad to work properly.


what type of packages? I have installed everything shown by update manager. Found that I didn face this problem until i run on AC Power. Once i switch to battery mode i am facing  this problem. Is there any other work around?

How about adding it to /etc/fstab?

That is how it is usually done.

there are symbols to represent year, month etc., and grantha letters
and tamizh numeric representation  is also there.

cos ?, ??, ?? need also be included in count.  tamizh ??? (?? inside
?) was recently included, i suppose.

apart from this there are few symbols once Ramanraj had made  a
presentation about. these are symbols for representing fraction value
as low as 1/32000 that tamilzh people used to have in their practise.,

these need not be used but he suggested a separate plane (am not
exactly sure)  be requested for tamil as china demanded for chinese.
and these be put there. so that in future if it is need for some
purpose to be shown for archaelogical, research etc., reasons, they
can be used.

this is where we can have a national role. the grantha scripts in
itself do not have place in unicode right now.

we can make arrangement for space for entire grantha scripts there.
and they need not be included in the range of tamizh scripts.

but then sorting would pose problems. so the minimum grantha scripts
like ? after ? can be included here as well as there?

need to discuss with experts :-)

Hmm .. I had a similar requirement a while back and pmount came in handy.
Did you comment the relevant /etc/fstab entry and add pmount to /etc/rc.local ?

Assuming Synaptics Touchpad

Look up xorg.conf file >> Input Device Section for Synaptics.

Section "InputDevice"
         Identifier      "Synaptics Touchpad"
         Driver          "synaptics"
         Option          "SendCoreEvents"        "true"
         Option          "Device"                "/dev/psaux"
         Option          "Protocol"              "auto-dev"
         Option          "HorizScrollDelta"      "1"
         Option          "SHMConfig"
EndSection

Normally, the SHMConfig line would be missing, Introduce it and restart 
X11. Using the Synaptic frontend, install gsynaptics or qsynaptics pkg 
for a graphical frontend to configure the pad/buttons.

To just turn off the pad, give synclient off at bash prompt.

Works on my Dell with Gutsy.

dont worry about them. I will - afaik, problems with Tamil are the  
same as problems with other languages, and we need also, while  
focussing on individual languages, solving common problems. My need  
is simple. I like to think of myself as an Indian - so I would like a  
common solution to these problems so that I dont have to keep  
changing gears to deal with different languages.

a common solution is essential - with extras to deal with individual  
quirks. I would hate for a plane taking off in Tamilnadu to crash  
over Karntaka because the length of strings are calculated  
differently in the two states ;-)

inscript is very important - it means I can use the same keys to type  
the same word in any Indic script.

no - afaik ordering is correct in Kannada and devnagiri. There was a  
goof up only in Tamil as the governement representative to the  
relevant conference had not done his homework. This is subject to  
correction.

there are three cases:

1. consonant + vowel becomes a new shape - tamil, kannada, telugu and  
malayalam
2. consonant + consonant becomes new shape - kannada, telugu,  
malayalam and devnagiri

which means that kannada, telugu and malayalam have even more shapes  
than devnagiri

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0711190012480.30214@chi.spunge.org>

Hi,
I wanted to see the tamil news sites
       www.dinamalar.com
       www.dailythanthi.com
       www.dinakaran.com
       thatstamil.oneindia.in

I used Internet Explorer 6. After I downloaded the fonts everything(all
the sites) worked fine(shown properly in nicely readable format).

The same thing when I tried with Firefox 2.0.0.9, it is not showing the
sites properly.

I use Windows XP home edition(Though I use Linux out of my interest), I
need to used windows xp for unavoidable circumstances. So, NO Flame wars
or advises to go to Linux. ;)

I searched in net; though pointed to various sites, nothing were much
useful. I dont want to use scripts(like greasemonkey kind of stuffs).

When things work so well with Internet Explorer, IS it so difficult for
Firefox to work properly.

Note: Same question I posted long time before but did not get any fruitful
solution. After that, I think some body would have faced similar problem
and figured out a solution, so, I am asking again.

Thanks,
Regards.

For the first three, once you install the respective fonts in their website,
there won't be any problem.  I have been using Firefox and viewing all of
the above sites with out any font problems.

Thatstamil is now changed to Unicode encoding and hence no need to download
any fonts.  The browser automatically detect UTF-8 and display Tamil
properly provided you have enabled Indic language support in your system.
If not, see http://www.mksarav.org/blog/enable-indic-lang.html

Most of the time magazine sites have their websites in proprietary encodings
and they provide dynamic fonts in their websites. Dynamic font technology
works only Internet explorer, so you wont find any problem in viewing those
sites in internet explorer.
But if you try copy paste the contents from the above website into notepad,
you will find they are shown as junk data.

For firefox (in any platform), we have a better work around for viewing
these sites. Thats by using Padma firefox extension.
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/873

Padma firefox extension, converts the proprietory text into unicode text on
the fly and you will be able to view the sites in unicode. You can even save
the content as unicode text.

1. create .fonts folder in your home dir.
2. Download the fonts and copy it to the .fonts folder
3. Restart the X or logout and login
4. Now try to view the site.

please set an environment variable MOZ_ENABLE_PANGO with value 1 or 
MOZ_DISABLE_PANGO with value 0

and try or install the indic packages from your control panel. refer to

Yes. Did that. pmount told me, my /dev/sda2 is not a removable device. So I
simply uncommented the /etc/fstab entry again and removed the 'p' from
pmount from /etc/rc.local. ;-)  Neat. It works now. Thanks!

That, or one representative decided that all Indian languages are same
and can have the same ordering. The latter is more likely.

The Tamil unicode encoding table is a pain to see. Anyone with
elementary knowledge of Tamil will reject it outright.

http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0B80.pdf

1. See the blanks after ? ? ? ? ?. For other Indian languages 3 more
slots were allocated, so tamil gets the blanks.

2. ? comes after  ? before ?. as in Hindi. In tamil ? is the last letter.

An expert can go on with more points.

There are 57 blanks in the range. One can only wonder at the wisdom of
great unifers :-(

the goof up was by tamil experts. One possible reason being that  
unlike most other Indian languages (except bengali and urdu) several  
countries are involved in the decision making regarding Tamil, and  
there are lots of conflicts here.

Unlikely. That is why I say "he Tamil unicode encoding table is a pain
to see. Anyone with
elementary knowledge of Tamil will reject it outright."

I am not an expert, but I know tamil alphabets. When I can see the
mistake and how it came about, do you believe that any tamil "expert"
would have signed off on such a lay out?

Also i went through the tagset for Tamil. There ???? is given as noun. it may 
be noun in english.

but it is called ??????????? in tamil. to call maram as noun is processing tamil 
for english and not for tamil.

I know experts were consulted in this, but is wondering why they are also 
allowing it to be so.

i would like to see maram called as peyarchol than noun. may at last there can 
be a column to give the equivalent form in english. 

unfortunately the ???????? ???????? for ???? in not at all mentioned in the 
tagset.

My honest opinion..   If you are really passionate about FOSS and want 
to prove yourself,  do something on your own.. come up with a project or 
contribute to some project.. like what you did for netbeans..  don't 
expect your company to pay you to work on open source projects, it 
rarely happens.  you should be  really lucky if you get enough free time 
to work on hobby projects, while working for some good company.

Yes. Did that. pmount told me, my /dev/sda2 is not a removable device. So I
simply uncommented the /etc/fstab entry again and removed the 'p' from
pmount from /etc/rc.local. ;-)  Neat. It works now. Thanks!

will a native english speaker agree to call a noun as peyarchol?

tree is noun and ???? is ???????????

tagset is synonymous to what school boys study as ???????? ???????? for words in 
?????. 

the equivalent ???????? ???????? was not mentioned at all in the tagset. that 
should have place as a separate column.

tree is noun in english and ???? is

??????????? in tamil and maram is noun in  
english. Maram is Hauptwort in german and baum is  
??????????? in tamil. In short, each language  
has it's own word for 'noun' which is used in that language. The  
tamil tagset is written in english - so it uses the word 'noun', if

I understand that the currently accepted way towards fixing is to get
the state language body to raise the issue with TDIL who in turn would
raise it at an Unicode meeting. This, unless TN state is a member of the
Unicode Consortium itself (which I have heard in some quarters is a
thing that is being considered)

As Kenneth pointed out, Tamil is an official language in Ceylon,
Malaysia, Singapore also. A joint effort would be needed, I guess.

yes. i am saying it should also be given in Tamizh. 

why?

Remember when you had announced the release of it, balanchander had asked 
asked what it is and i had replied its somesort POS representation.

even you had recommended the words be represented in tamizh scripts.

if it had been conveyed as, all possible ???????? ???????? in of tamizh words, 
every one would have understood at the outset. 

why?

then, even a school kid learing kid can answer what is a tagset.

DIT is a member of the Unicode Consortium. NRC-FOSS comes under DIT.  
NRC-FOSS has some influence with DIT. Anything presented to DIT  
through NRC-FOSS will be listened to, if not acted upon. I suggest  
proposals be formulated and presented. I had suggested that to  
Ramanraj also, but he didnt pursue it with us. This could be a useful  
subject for a sprint for fossconf also - getting large number of  
opinions on the defects in the present Tamil Unicode and suggestions  
for change. But it needs to be taken seriously and studied seriously  
and serious people be involved so a serious proposal be made rather  
than making half-baked uninformed comments. (This last sentence is  
not aimed at anyone in particular so please dont start a flame war on  
that). Anyone interested? It means contacting all the stakeholders in  
this domain and eliciting reactions/participation from them. Also  
contacting people in Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapur.

Yes. Initially for allocating the space in the Unicode table, Indian
Govt gave the ISCII as standard covers all the Indian languages, that
is actual problem. 

Now join effect from our govt + other country is needed to get proper
code space for Tamil.

AFAIK in TN, there is NO unity between the people, who are responsible
for taking this steps. Everyone wants to push his/her own idea.

what they have done is this,

??? - ?????????? , then they wanted the English equivalent and put verb and an 
abbreviation for it.

???? - ???????????, then they wanted the English equivalent and put noun and an 
abbreviation for it.

then we have ??????? ?????????? ??????, ?????, ????? etc., etc.,which they have 
represented as  masculine, transitive, intransitive, suffix, singular, plural 
etc., etc.,

all put together is identified as tagset. and there are 68 of them.

we can do it back. need to check my school books.

Thanks for summing this up. Doing this in as transparent a manner as
possible would mean that folks who look into the arcane ends of things
like rendering engines, fonts, keyboard layouts can also track and
provide assessment of changes which would (and ideally should) lead
towards a solution that is pragmatic and practical.

I'd suggest that if the defects are listed, then the fossconf can become
a venue for assessment and way forward discussions.

I spoke to Mr. Senthilnathan, who was involved in discussions of a
committee formed to put forward proposals for correcting Tamil
Unicode. He essentially said what Bharathi says.

Every one wants to push their ideas.
Members are book publishers, tamil font developers etc.
Almost no one had proper technical understanding.

According to Mr. Senthilnathan, the case should be presented by
technical people. What are the problems of the current code space in
technical implementation? What are the solutions in line with the
policies of Unicode consortium.

He mentioned 2 points:
1. Ordering/sorting is not the goal of Unicode, it should be handled
by individual applications.
2. Character counts (2 slots for the same character) is not an Unicode
issue, but should be handled by each application.

Hariram might be able to throw more light on these points,

yes. we can have a special library built for each languages to do this, as i 
had suggested. that will ease the problem.

these can be requested to be added to commonly used libraries so that just 
inhereting from it can give desired results in each application.

As of now, we don't have space in the current plane of Unicode for
getting the proper sequence. We may get it some other space and this 
change need to be applied to apps and fonts etc...

Anyway for long term comfort we have to go this steps...

Yes, I plan to continue my work on NetBeans and ODF Toolkit for Java.

Actually I am dreaming of a slot in Sun Microsystems :-) where it seems
employees have a really great time working on Open Source projects.

Praying hard the opportunity comes along!

I got the same model a week before for 53.5K and it is very good. I
removed the Windows Vista which came preloaded with this laptop
(including the separate partition which is used for the recovery
purpose) and installed Debian Etch. Since Debian Etch did not have out
of box support and requires some time to configure the Nvidia card, I
installed Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon which worked out of the box with all the
hardware configured. Of course Nvidia uses a restricted driver in
Ubuntu. But there is no issues and it rocks :)

I am lucky enough to have my cient - Ma Foi Academy allows me to use open

hi swapon,

how are you doing? 

Fedora 8 has lots of new things... it depends on what you are looking
at...

you might like to look at new virtualization enhancements. the new
firewall configuration utility.. among other things..

http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9722 James explores the DRM-free
music site Magnatunes, the company whose cheeky motto is "We are not
evil."

> LJ TIP: Redux of "Automatically Send Your rm Files to the Trash"
Last week we offered you a tip on aliasing the rm command, so that the
deleted files end up in the Trash rather than into the ether. Paul
from Switzerland and our in-house guru, Mitch Frazier, suggested some
changes as follows. First, here's what Paul said:

I don't like, I even hate, replacing dangerous commands as rm with a
seemingly safer version. There are two main reasons:

1. rm may be used by many scripts, system or personal, where the safer
command is not wanted (e.g. could overflow .Trash etc.)

2. Much more importantly, if you get used to a safe rm, you start to
use it (more) blindly, and when you are on an other machine without
safety belt you may make really bad mistakes. I have seen too many
accidents with similar redefinitions of rm with users moving to other
machines, helping colleagues, and destroying important files.

A better solution: name your safe version slightly differently. Why 
not:

alias rmt='mv --target-directory ~/.Trash'

Which reminds you that it is "rm into Trash". rmt is safe everywhere,
and not much more difficult to use than just rm. And the original rm
is still available, unchanged, for all existing scripts. Of course, it
is probably good to use rm or /bin/rm in scripts to have the original
one.

And here is Mitch Frazier's response:

I would agree with [Paul's] first point, it's probably not a good idea
to alias commands like rm in scripts. Particularly when the alias is
in another script altogether. Besides the problems he points out, you
don't want to do it because now your script won't work for anybody
else (since the alias is not in the script itself, it's in .bashrc).

The problem with the original tip is that (probably) rather than 
saying:

Put following into ~/.bashrc

it could have been:

Put following into ~/.aliases

When you put an alias in .aliases rather than in .bashrc it does not
get expanded when you run a shell script. Aliases from .aliases are
only expanded for interactive shells, ie you typing at the shell
prompt.  Putting it in .aliases, I would say, is a reasonable use of
an alias.  Personally, I'd rather make my life easier/safer during the
99.99% of the time that I'm typing on my system than worry about the
0.01% of the time when I'm working on somebody else's system. Stuff
happens everyday of the week, not just when you're at somebody else's
house.

One of Linux's greatest strengths is that it's easily customized.  
Although most distributions ship with a variety of standard tools for
specific purposes (such as sendmail as a mail server or Vixie Cron to
handle repeated jobs), alternative tools are readily available. You
can rip out just about any component, either removing it entirely or
replacing it with something else. Linux lets you remove or replace
more components than most operating systems, allowing the savvy
administrator to customize a Linux installation for specific purposes.

Hi

Could anyone give me a copy of Fedora 8 i386 DVD. I could come and

Should I install indic language support for Windows XP
to read the above 
tamil new sites in Firefox?  It requires 250 mb of
space.

Both in Ubuntu 7.10 and Windows XP, I have installed
the firefox extension 
Padma 0.4.11  to read the tamil news sites.
The problem is soon after opening the sites in
firefox, the fonts are 
displayed properly only for a few a seconds. Then it
reverted to junk 
characters.
What should I do for proper display of tamil fonts?

I shall very much appreciate your help.

To view Indian Language Unicode characters properly, enabling Indic
lang support is a must in Windows XP and it has nothing to do with the
particular browser.

I have never used any extension to see the news sites mentioned in the
original post.  I just installed the respective fonts of the news
website (for the first 3) and for thatstamil you need to enable Indic
lang support since it is already using Unicode/UTF-8.

For proprietary encoded fonts, some time changing your font encoding
to "ISO-8859-1" will help (for e.g. vikatan will show junk characters
in Firefox even if you have installed vikatan fonts given in their
website, but if you change the character encoding to iso-8859-1, then
you can read them properly :-)  That's what I am doing for the last
few years.

I do remember talking to you about this subject in a LUG meet. I'm
guessing I'm the guy you are looking for.

That being said I do not have any expertise in this subject per se. I
did spend time learning to use a piece of software and then trying to
teach it to a student at the place I am working.

As mentioned by Suresh above Arun Mehta is indeed the person to
contact w.r.t to this subject. I've been in touch with him through
email, discussing the software he wrote that I just mentioned.

The name of the software that they developed is eLocutor. The relevant
urls about this software are the following:
http://www.radiophony.com/html_files/download3.html
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hawking
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/radiophony/

The third url is for a discussion group about eLocutor among other
things. It requires one to be a member of the group to view messages,
so unfortunately discussions cannot be followed from the outside.

Like I said above, I'm pretty familiar with this program and can walk
people through how it works, if Arun Mehta is not available for some
reason.

eLocutor is Free Software, under the GPL (v2). The urls I have just
mentioned provide a thorough explanation of  what the constraints were
that led to it being designed the way it was.

The two sentence version is that it assumes the user of the program is
capable of just two voluntary motions, to press and release a button,
or press, hold for a while and then release. With those two voluntary
actions a user can create text, edit it, save it, etc and/or have the
program speak out what they have typed.

The program is written in VB, and is therefore currently Windows only.
As I recall, I had discussed with you what programming language to use
to port it to Linux.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to follow up on those discussions
and ideas. I'm still intend to do it if no one else does it first.

I can put you in touch with additional people who can give a
perspective of a would-be user and /or parents and teachers working
with people with cerebral palsy.

I'm out of Chennai right now, but when I return you are most welcome
to come and get a first hand look at the challenges involved in
computing for people with cerebral palsy, and also at various pieces
of hardware and software that are being used, including some pretty
cool stuff that got developed very recently.

I'll be back in a few days. Anytime from the 29th November onwards is ok for me.

Well, Matlab's not Free, but you can try Octave
(http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) or Scilab
(http://www.scilab.org/)

not free - use octave or scilab (scilab is also not free, but free as

as already suggested, scilab and octave are good alternatives.
could you tell what sort of usage you have in mind?
As part of "Migrate to FOSS" for university curriculum, we have done some
study of Scilab -- ran all B.E. (ECE, EEE, EIE) experiments. we also plan to
study octave.

Your inputs could give us some focus as to what further to do. One action
step planned is to conduct a 1-day session for lecturers on "Scilab for engg
degree lab experiments".
If possible we would like to include you (and others interested) in our
discussions in this regard.

thanks, Srinivasan, NRCFOSS.

Message-ID: <8ee1e7110711230405q6d88d3d6t787e66a2466aefa0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am looking for some comments/suggestions on the compatibility and the
seamless
working of trading websites with Firefox on Linux. My experience with a
couple of them
have been very bad.
>From my experience I have seen that any trading website which claim to offer
real time data
of stock quotes(stock tickers) require Microsoft VM and IE.
1) Bonanzaonline.com is one such website which has a horrible interface and
also
    requires Microsoft VM and IE
2) Usectrade.com (offered by UTI securities) has 2 web based versions.
     a) Basic - Works with Firefox without any problem. This one has no real
time
         stock tickers. The UI is not great but far better than the previous
one.
     b) Advanced - Offers real time data. It requires a java enabled
browser(IE/Firefox)
          But also says the desired OS is windows. - I havent tried this so
I am just not sure
          about its compatiblity with a java enabled firefox on linux.
3) Icicidirect.com- On date this is the best interface I have seen. Works
without any issues
     on firefox. It doesnt offer real time stock tickers. Leaving alone the
brokerage concerns
     I would say this is by far the best on terms of features and usability.

I want to know if there any sites which offer a clean usable
interface(probably with AJAX) so
thats its totally comaptible with firefox on linux.
Looking forward ...for replies

But, is scilab user friendly? I mean, does it has any GUI? One of my team
mate is very good at matlab, and if he don`t find scilab or octave user
friendly and not very native of matlab, he will definitely reject it.
Some days ago, i installed scilab; but i didn`t find any GUI there.

Hi All,

 I am in need of  Free BSD and Open BSD distros  on CDs  ( not DVDs)-- the
problem is the systems on which these are going to be  installed have only
16MB of RAM ( that is right)    on Pentium 1 or so. So  I need the following

1) is there any one who can help me with the version of these OS that work
on such a low configuration ?
2) could they please provide me with the  cds of the corresponding
versions.( these machines don't have net access so installing from the FTP
or some or other such method is not possible.)

I stay in Arrumbakkam( near Anna arch) my office is in Alwarpet  I can come
and collect these CDs   at any  one of these places or even if they are in
the vicinity of these places.

Thanks for reading


Regards
Raj

Such incompatibility issues have been raised time and again.  It not 
just trading sites but newspapers (asian age), e-Governance sites that 
require IE because the server sends VBscript to the browser!  

It boils down to following of standards.  But then many believe that IE 
is the defacto standard and not W3C.   Most of the sites are developed 
on a tender basis where the client (here the trading company) probably 
does not specify compatability with W3C, so the contracting company 
takes the easy way out (or perhaps the team only knows IIS and IE 
platform).  Suggest you write directly to the head honcho of the 
company with a couple of screen shots of the site and see if you can 
elicit any response.  If not, you may have to keep looking.  
Unfortunately, many such companies truly believe that IE is the only 
browser out there.  Sigh :(

Hi,

--- Baskar wrote:
| Looking for everyone's feedback and suggestions
\--

Some feedback:

1. Why FOSS for education?

The first reason should be 'freedom'. Cost is secondary. The first
reason always registers in peoples' mind, strongly, compared to the
other points. So, it is important.

2. The Most Popular FOSS Programs

Linux is a kernel, not an OS.

3. The Most Popular FOSS Programs

Statements with "#1" are quite debatable. You need to give some
statistics, or just mention as popular. That is good enough.

4. Put a license in the documentation that mentions how this
documentation can be distributed/re-used.

5. Avoid giving private/college data in your screenshots. Use dummy data.

It is ok to mention it, but, don't give their internal contact details
(unless you have permission from them).

6. For some pictures that you have used or copied from some website
(like Linus Torvalds, RMS), give source web link as to from where you
have taken it from.

The desktop screenshots are yours, so they are ok.

Overall, you have provided good coverage of available applications.

On a side note, your screenshots show that you have logged to X as
root user. Do you use your desktop like that?

Regards,

SK

Hmm, not entirely sure if this solves your problem, but there is a stock
ticker that comes with gnome-applets that lets you add it to your panel.

Well, someone apparently found it to be annoying and created his own pet
project

Is there any limitation? As far as I know most Image processing
algorithms can be written using the various transforms. Once you are
able to read the image as a matrix, then its your brains which have to
do the work. :-) Maybe I am wrong and I agree Matlab is far more
powerful. But I dont find much necessity for that powerful tools for
students who hardly even use the fft() function ;-) of matlab.

Btw, some nice doc here
http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Image-Processing.html#Image-Processing

Correct me if am wrong.

Message-ID: <e43212340711232126va86016ao9bea4e5f16e92fe2@mail.gmail.com>

Dear LUGs,
                I tried 1GB Scandisk cruzer pen Drive for Linux booting drive.
I tried various distros,

1. Puppy Linux 3.0
        It is easy to use. Puppy universal Installer makes easy to
configure USB as boot drive. Tinny space occupation (90MB). It can
make USB as bootable without MBR. It will work on all SATA, PATA HHD
contained PCs. It is required minimum 256 MB USB.

2. Slax (200 MB)
        It is an wonderful and small Linux for USB. But creation of
USB work on the same pc or same type of PCs. If creation PC contains
single HHD, then you use in PC having 2 HHD booting problem caused. It
is required minimum 256 MB USB. feather Linux and RUNT website are not
available but many websites shows its installation guidelines.

3. Pendrive Linux (400MB)
        It is an excellent debian flavour linux and easy to create USB
drive on both Linux and Windows. But same problem as in slax using.It
is required 512 MB USB but 1GB is better.

4. Ubuntu Linux
       It is an standard CD.ISO image used to create USB boot drive.
But it required minimum 1GB USB pendrive but 2GB is best.

          Just i tried. If any other distros tried by anybody please
post your experience.

I also required an a guide to manual pendrive Linux creation tutorial
from ISO files. or any other tutorial to create LInux OS boot device
by using kernel, individual packages.

User friendliness is one's perspective. GUI != User friendly.

dear kenneth,

thanks for accepting and publishing the logos. this is to confirm the
copyright of the logo and associated files is assigned to the
conference.
if and where posible on the site somewhere, do add an 'about the logo'
page where you may mention me as the author of the design, with the
text explaining the logo design.

the final logo has all the changes you requested. the actual banner on
the site still uses the older, rejected one, with 'fosscon.in' and the
actual dates. please do change that so you may have a universal use of
the logo everywhere.

thanks

:-)

few suggestions

1. the logo of registration website is in JPG format. lets move to png as
its widely used by many communities i.e i guess png is open source
2. lets us FOSS to do anything related with FOSSConf.in
3. lets make sure all work related to conference is licensed under a Creative

than under any organisation name
4. lets have a separate discussion forum related to conference (i thought
abt this because ppl subscribed to ILUGC expect lots of technical
discussions rather than discussion abt fossconf event. lets use the ILUGC
mailing list for announcement kind of)

like, this logo is attached with redhat or this logo is attached with fsf 
etc.,

adding this list,
this line from the bottom "copyright 2007
NRC-FOSS<webmaster@nrcfosshelpline.in>" should be removed. again do we
support copyright / copyleft?

Instead we can add a line "All trademarks and copyrights on this page are
owned by their respective owners."

sorry for not sending in earlier email. forgive me :(

You probably want the source format under SVG. Manipulations are much 
more easier that way.

Hello friends,

Can someone please educate me on how qemu networking works?

I believe it is some kind of special bridging but I am really confused
how packets travel back and forth with the 'weird' routing table I see.

Thanks.

Are you using usermode networking? (Qemu has two networking modes tap 
and usermode)

In usermode networking, for every TCP/UDP socket opened within the 
guest, qemu opens a corresponding TCP/UDP socket in the host. Qemu does 
this by snooping the ethernet frames that it receives from the network 
cards emulated by qemu. This block diagram shows the various stacks 
involved and their role in user mode networking --

Hi All

But how to boot through USB.?
In my BIOS , the options are USB-FDD,
USB-ZIP, USB-CDROM,USB-HDD.

I want to use the normal USB Flash drive (Kingston, Transcend etc.,) for
booting.

I believe USB-HDD is what should work.

I think you need to register a trademark if you want to restrict that
way. If you can't modify the logo then it is non-free and I don't
think it is a good idea to use a non-free logo for a foss conference.

If we don't practice what we preach, then what is the point, we would
be like Canaonical people (well, foss is good and everything but we
are spending money developing launchpad, no? and foss is just for
stuff _you_ get it for free not what you develop). They have all the
legal right to do so but then what makes them different from
Microsoft? (well atleast Microsoft does not claim they are a foss
company). I think it is on topic because similar actions by other
members of the community didn't go well with the community.

Then there is also the Firefox logo trademark issue and iceweasel.
Lets not repeat the mistakes.

What is wrong if somebody wants to sell toothpaste with it?

Great. That explains why GRE and ICMP packets don't go thro'.

Many thanks.

government's does this by declaring it a public belonging. the first such

http://www.debian.org/logos/    <----- there are two types of license  
for logos here. I like the official use logo license, but it can be  
discussed. The license should, in my opinion, be like this:

0. This logo has been designed by Niyam Bhushan and the copyright for  
it has been assigned to FossConf
1. The copyright of this logo belongs to FossConf
2. This logo, or a modification of it may be only used to refer to  
the FossConf.
3. If this logo, or a modification of it is used on a web page, a  
link to the FossConf website - currently http:// 
registration.fossconf.in/web/ *must* be added.
4. The use of this logo by any product, organisation or site does not  
indicate that the said product, organisation or site is endorsed by  
FossConf.
5. Since FossConf is not yet a legal entity, the copyright of the  
logo is being held by NRC-FOSS on behalf of FossConf until such time  
as FossConf becomes a legal entity.

6. [optional] This logo may be used to sell toothpaste provided the  
said toothpaste is free and does not contain any proprietary  
ingredients or formulae. However this does not imply that the said  
toothpaste is endorsed by FossConf.

the conference software is copyrighted by NRC-FOSS. It is free  
software released under the BSD license. The source code and license  
are available at https://svn.nrcfosshelpline.in/public/conference.  
The same are also viewable on the conference trac wiki http:// 
registration.fossconf.in/code/. The person who writes the software  
gets the copyright and gets to decide what license to use. I wrote/am  
writing the software and I have decided to use the BSD license. I  
have assigned the license to NRC-FOSS which is releasing it under the  
BSD license. As for the contents of the website, I agree that it  
should be under some creative commons license - I will modify the  
footer to reflect the same. This is a generic footer that we put on  
all our sites - thanks for pointing out the difference between the  
conference software and the content.

        Yeah, this is the shame of the Debian project.  There is talk
 about doing  GR to make both the logos free software, and I guess I'll
 undertake that when I have time (perhaps in spring)

        This makes the logo just as non-free as the Debian official logo
 (and where have you ever seen the official logo being used?), which is
 a pity.

it's freer than the official logo - allows modification - but not as  
free as the open use logo. Could you suggest modifications of the

        My gut says t go with the GPL -- I mean, trust people not to use
 a logo which says "Fossconf chennai feb 2008"  to refer to something
 else, really. Or allow modification, but ask for a name change  (don't
 refer to fossconf in the derived work).

        In lots of situations, less control works out OK.  On the other
 hand, if you treat people like criminals, they tend to behave  like
 that.

        Is there any credible harm that a restrictive license is
 shielding us from?

Message-ID: <dc538c3f0711250040i5f9503fcm73a82f418da95afc@mail.gmail.com>

Current Steps for Registration

1. Login here http://registration.fossconf.in/web/register/ and  give
username and email address
2. You will get a key in your email
3. clicking on it takes you to
http://registration.fossconf.in/web/adduser/[some<http://registration.fossconf.in/web/adduser/%5Bsome>autogenerated
number]/ where it asks again for username and password. on
giving username, password and confirm password, it goes to login page
without saying anything

What needs to be changed here
1. Step 1 is good and let autogenerate password here and send to specified
email here instead of making 3 steps registration process. lets give the
user the flexibility of changing the password at first login.
2.http://registration.fossconf.in/web/addtalk/ and
http://registration.fossconf.in/web/managetalks/
should be visible only after user login. say user home page.

Bug kind of....
1. After receiving key from the registration email, if i once registered,
key should not be active again. but at present it still active. i go there
to re-register and if i give username and password (both same) , it shows me
the exceptions (IntegrityError...). we  need to avoid this.

Usability issues
1. After receiving key from the registration email, i go there to register
my username(re-entering). it would be good if it automaticaly shows the
username rather than re-entering

Logo / Name correction
i see the text "FossConf". i guess it should be FOSSConf rather than
FossConf as FOSS is abbreviated to Free and Open Source Software (correct me
if i am wrong). what Foss mean here? can someone please explain.

Note: I cannot contribute in terms of fixing these issues what i have

Exactly what are we going to gain by this restriction? Preventing some
other foss conference using it?

no copyleft, cc, gpl.. thats because, 

i always have a feeling that we need to import only things that we do not have

may it be goods, technology or it be language ;-)

dear all,

a few days ago baskar sent the following email and link to a presenation on
the list:

  Hi all,

  Looking for everyone's feedback and suggestions

  http://linuxbaskar.googlepages.com/free-software-for-education.pdf

  Baskar
  LinuXpert Systems


just read through the excellent presentation. a few suggestions:

a) please publish this under an FDL or similar copyleft license, on a public
repository with sourcefiles, so others may contribute and enrich this
further.

b) please add video-edit software such as kino. camcoders are becoming
digital commodities.

c) show openclipart.org, as well as galleries of openoffice.org templates
from the web.

d) show migration from windows, how contacts, emails, bookmarks, and other
data flies in.

e) google-earth on the desktop. i now this is not a foss software, so
perhaps you could show maps in the browser.

f) a digital photo of a computer booting with gnulinux on a thumbdrive.

g) shots of foss events in india: this to show the vibrant and growing
community around foss.

h) since this is targeted to academia, hence a bit more on learning
management systems, moodle, schoolforge, etc. this usually works as a pretty
solid clincher in academia, from my experience.

i) finally, my favourite screenshot: solitaire. this gets a few chuckles and
laughs, but everyone tends to identify with this, and this eases everyone's
attitude towards gnulinux as a desktop: yes! it can be used for frivolous
and fun stuff as well.

j) i would change the amarok screenshot to show the genres of net
radio-stations by genre.

what exactly are you trying to say here? Is it your thesis that any  
company that promotes, develops or distributes opensource/free  
software should not at the same time use, develop or distribute  
closed source software?

if a user is not logged in, clicking on those links will send him to  
the login page. I agree it should be only visible to logged-in users,  
but it is a little difficult to implement. And maybe it will  
encourage users to register? It is now on todo list - but very low  
priority

the 'code' sent with the registration mail is a rather weak one, if  
large number of people are registering, there is no guarrantee that a  
bot cannot create a duplicate. But no bot  can find out both the code  
and username. This is far more effective than those irritating captchas.

I personally dont mind if another foss conference uses it - but Niyam  
has made it so good that lots of other people would be tempted to use  
it for their products.

Hello All,

Over the last month, there has been a lot of emails specific to setting 
up Fossconf on ILUG-C. While I love the idea of having a Fossconf in 
Chennai and will participate, I think ILUG-C mailing list is not the 
right place for organizers to discuss the details.

Can we have a separate mailing list for Fossconf organization so that 
all those threads can be moved over there?

Vaidhy

I thought ILUG Chennai was also a part of the organizing body, in fact
the majority of physical volunteers are from ILUGC as well as members
of NRCFOSS are also (almost) the members of ILUGC. Why should we not
discuss about an event that ILUGC organizes in its mailing list?

ILUGC is not the entity here.. Members of ILUGC are organizing it.. But 
ILUGC is a superset.

Further, like all other previous discussions (flamewars) we had, ILUGC 
is about discussing Linux primarily and FOSS to some extent.

Also, carrying to the logical conclusion, if Deepan and I decide to do 
a cricket tournament (for ILUGs) and start using ILUGC to discuss stuff, 
all of you would be pointing out that ILUGC is not the right place and 
you do not need to know what our logo is or how many balls we got. We 
would reply saying that Deepan and I are members of ILUGC, so ILUGC is 
organizing the tournament and hence we should discuss anything we want 
on the mailing list. Next time, it will be a discussion on political 
activity, language  stuff and soon a free for all.

By the same logic, I am not organizing Fossconf and I do not want to 
know the details. I am member of ILUGC because I use Linux and am 
interested in its development.

Why should I get spammed with the details of Fossconf when it is not the 
primary purpose of the mailing list? There is also something known as 
"tyranny of the majority..." at which point this argument also 
degenerates into another flamewar :)

Cheers,
Vaidhy

Its not just the memebrs, the LUG itself is an organizer with NRCFOSS.

Does Crikcet and FOSSConf fall into the same category? Explained
below, why FOSSConf is more important to this mailing list.

Then just discard the mails falling into this topic, set a filter to
do so. May be we can add a [FOSSConf] tag to all future mailing list
to help people set their filters appropriately?

>

[1] The primary purpose of a LUG is to spread the awareness about
GNU/Linux and also FOSS. We haven't been speaking just about GNU/Linux
here, but a lot of things related to FOSS as well.

[2] FOSSConf is one another endeavor of ILUGC with NRCFOSS, and it
pertains to FOSS and GNU/Linux. Hence it is not an OT to this list and
as ILUGC is organizing this, it is wise to be discussed in in ILUGC"s
public mailing list so that everyone interested can participate in
this. Discussions also get into the archives which serves as a future
reference.

If we start creating mailing list for each and every
conference|workshop that we organize, for just a mere fact that a few
in the mailing list do not care about it, then we are going to end up
with a dozen such lists, while on the other hand the main list will be
totally blank about whats happening.

        Logos are software.  That is the Debian view as well -- computer
 related stuff is either hardware, software, or wetware.  Clearly, logos
 are represented on computer hard drives as zeros and ones, and are,
 tus, software.

        Just as Debian makes software so good that other people are
 tempted to use it for their products.  Like canonical. Or Xandros.

        Having our creative products used by other people is what free
 software is all about.  Retain copyrights. Feed back improvements. Use
 our creative efforts for whatever you want, or need, to.

        I am surprised I am having to remind people about this on this
 forum.

when i joined ILUGC, it was purely a GNU/Linux mailing list where i
discussed a lot, my issues got it resolved from people. now a days, i do not
see such technical discussions. most discussions involve broadband
connectivity(repeatably being asked), FOSS philosophy etc

i guess ILUGC being diverted from a technical mailing list to a general
mailing list (this is purely my opinion)

I agree. but ppl should also remember there is a non-tech ILUGC mailing list

        I am of the school of thought that freedom helps people achive
 their greatest potential. That hoarding knowledge hurts people, by
 restricting their freedom. That we can stand on shoulder of giants only
 when the giant's shoulders are not locked up, and only released for
 pay.

        If a free software conference can't stop hoarding information
 and creative property, then perhaps true advocated of freedom need to
 start boycotting it?

not so. It so happens that this logo was designed using a computer.  
It could as well have been designed using paint and paper. And it  
will be mostly distributed on paper, cloth and other materials. And  
modifications made may not be made on the computer. Next you will be  
saying that a building designed on a computer is software

this doesnt apply to logos - and debian itself agrees.

yes. GFDL is there for documentation. but why all these stuffs? 

niyam gave the copyright/ left to FOSSconf. 

freedom should be accompanied by responsibility. the intention of the design 
of the Logo is for FOSSconf.

people ought to be responsible, not to use it for any other intention other 
than FOSSconf.

thats my opinion.

I feel, We can hold the copyright of the logo and in the logo page, we
can indicated that, "We are ready to share this logo for a conf with
the same name and intention/philosophy".

Subject: [Ilugc] Fossconf -08 
Message-ID: <247460.76924.qm@web7903.mail.in.yahoo.com>

Dear All

        Regarding FOSSConf-08 several questions/doubts/objections
were raised. Let me try to answer/explain some of them.

a.Decision making. Who and how?
    This conference is jointly organised by ILUGC and NRCFOSS.
    We have formed a committee to take responsibility for 
    conducting the conference. From ILUGC side following
    are members

1. Raman P  raamanp at yahoo.co.in 
2. Bharathi  sbharathi at midascomm.com 
3. B Vijayakumar  vijaykumar at bravegnu.org 
4. A Saravanan  saran at lynusacademy.com 
5. Baskar
6. Srinivasan T 
7. Bhuvaneswaran A  bhuvan at ubuntu.com 
8. Vamsee Kanakala  vamsee at viamentis.com 
9. Joe Steeve  joe_steeve at gmx.net 
10. Senthil Kumaran S  stylesen at gmail.com 
11. Raja Subramanian  rajasuperman at gmail.com 
12. G.P.Pragadeeswaran (MIT)  computersociety.mit at gmail.com 

     The members were those who were active in organising/
participating in previous events[ some declined due to 
various reasons].

       NRCFOSS has nominated few members Dr.Srinivasan,KG,Shriramdas,
Ponnusamy.

      Most of the decisions are taken/will be taken after due
consultation with committee members.

b. New Members : We welcome new members, if they are willing to
  be 'physical volunteer'. They have to take responsibility to
  co-ordinate a task - like publicity, stall arrangement - etc.
  They must be able to spare time during the event, be present
  there, organise.
  More important take responsibility for fame/blame for the
  success/failure of the event.
  

c.We (here I mean the committee members) are NOT interested in
  'spamming' (borrowing word from vaidhy) the list. As of
  now only points raised were related to logo, website. 
  Whenever  we feel, it is better to get opinion from larger
  segment we approach the list.

d.I will be posting a summary of what is going on in the 
  committee once a week now onwards, and once in 2-3 days
  from Jan 15 2008 onwards. Hope that will not be considered
  spamming.

e.All your suggesstions can be recorded in the wiki pages
  of registration.fossconf.in.

f.You can also send me mail offlist for anything related
  to the event.


   I request all of you to take interest in making the conference a
grand success.

like they say on iitm campus, nice try. this non-tech group never took off, as
far as i can see. in the last one year, it has had two postings and in the last
two years, it goes upto about a dozen -  almost all from the same poster ...

but, putting a tag is a good idea and will perhaps allay the fears of getting
spammed.

I'm really surprised how Hippocratic people are when it comes stuff
which "they have designed" . It is our stuff, we don't want any one
else to use it, nobody should make money out of it... Just think for a
moment what made Niyam assign copyright to FOSSConf? I think because
it was FOSS. The basic idea of FOSS is sharing and building on other
people's work, and yet ...

Again how selfish people are, we need to get the code under BSD so
that we can use it in our non-free product but our work will be "All
rights reserved".

Please stop treating people as criminals like the record labels do (at
least they have money to lose - here we got the logo for free and yet
...)

Cheers

I'm in the community because I like being part of it. I spent my time
here because I feel it is useful to the community. I look at other
people's commitment by looking at how much they are giving back to the
community. So whenever I see someone who does not play well with the
community (Novell with their patent trap and Canonical with their
non-free launchpad) I decide not to play with them (I hope there are
others in the community who share the same view). because there are
others in the community who needs my time whom I can count on to  be
with the community come what may happen (Debian Social contract,
Fedora's commitment to Open Source, Utoto's commitment to Free
Software...). So I spent my time (and I have all the rights to decide
that) with those who have a demonstrated commitment to the community
and who give back.

So in this case if the FOSSConf goes the non-free way I will stop
supporting it, stop promoting it... Because there are other
conferences which respects the community and who does not treat people
like criminals who would value my time spent with them.

I completely agree with Manoj here. I'm surprised  how everyone in the
foss community thinks it is OK to be non-free when it is "my stuff".
Especially here it was not even original contribution (like
canonical), it was contributed by the community.

        You are mixing up abstract concepts and instanciations of the
 concept. The Logo, as it stands, can have multiple representations --
 some of which are hardware (when printed on paper and ink) -- and it
 has a software representation.

        Conceptually, they are different instanciations/representations
 of the same abstract entity -- and one of these representations is
 software.


        So, a building blueprint can indeed have a software
 representation.

        They use Debian intellectual property.

        No.  The Debian official logo is non-free -- we realize that.
 It is never shipped by any Debian product, since our products are all
 fee. Check it out.

        Having a non-free official logo is a blot on our name -- which
 is why it is so rarely used. Our website uses the free logo, for
 instance.

Message-ID: <20071126180242.GA7934@research.iiit.ac.in>

Does anyone have experience using the Tamil-India locale? I have been using
it for a few years now, but have some problems:

Non-ASCII punctuation, like ellipsis, "em" dash, etc. get replaced by Tamil
characters.

The "Monospace" font in Gnome-Terminal and XFCE Terminal, has got replaced
by some font which is not constant-width.

I am using Debian 4.0 . In my .bashrc, I have:

    export LANG='ta_IN.UTF-8'
    export LANGUAGE="ta:en"

I have not yet figured out whether the mistake is in the locale file
(/usr/share/i18n/locales/ta_IN), or in the fonts (ttf-tamil-fonts). Any help
would be great!

I just finished my BE there and would love to help.

If possible try to conduct a demo of installing linux on the systems.
Teach students how to install linux on their existing windows machine.
Try to get to install them on the labs.

Shakthi Kannan did a session there two years back. He would probably
have his slides on his site.

I am just looking at a huge advertisement in the newspaper - Compaq  
recommends Microsoft Windows Vista - so do you refuse to play with HP  
for doing things like this? You think we should refuse sponsorships  
from HP, Sun, IBM ... all of whom also make/use closed source software?

Hi, just curious. Is the talk targetted at the first years, since
semesters are going on for the seniors.

1. Do a demo of installing GNU/Linux as a dual boot machine. What
Raman and me did was to follow this by asking one of the students to
come forward and try installing the same over again. This gives
confidence among the students that when one of their buddies is able
to do it, then they can do it too.
2. Do not talk too much of philosophy. Students just drop them as
stories. Make them understand the importance of such philosophies by
giving practical examples. I love the way Raman gives examples for
stuff and even have them by-hearted ;)
3. As far as possible, after you show them something call 2 students
(from each gender) and ask them to try doing this themselves. This
will improve the confidence level among students and after a few
rounds they will actually compete to come and do things :)

I am somehow lost the presentation which we used. You can get it from
Raman, but I will suggest making a new copy of it, updating some of
the data/statistics present in the slides. :)

I tried Gutsy on a LiveUSB. When I gave it to my friend for trying. He chose
USB-ZIP. Maybe more options will work. Why don't you try each one?

        I certainly hoped for more from a free software group than I
 would from a proprietary company whose main goal is to make money for
 its share holders.

        Are you saying we should treat fossconf organizers as we would
 proprietary companies? Perhaps it _is_ time for a /. story.

you have missed the point - the above three companies are the biggest  
sponsors for FOSS events in India. The question I am asking is  
whether we should not approach them for sponsorship because they also  
have proprietary wings

        Actually, kenneth, I attacked the substance of your email, not
 extraneous elements like your MUA or the type of foot wear you use.

        Can you get back, old chap, to addressing the contents of the
 emails people are sending your way, as opposed to shoring up your
 arguments based on the email services the people are using?

        These are proprietary companies. Of course they have proprietary
 divisions.  What on earth does this have to your hoarding the creative
 efforts of someone else?

        No, I am afraid you are consistently demonstrating you have
 little understanding of what the free in free software is all about.

        Sure, there are companies that make money for their share
 holders using proprietary software, And yes, some of them  give money
 for free software conferences. This has little to do with free software
 organizations restricting freedom for creative efforts that they own.

        Why this power play?  Why are you trying to close off something
 that was given to you in he spirit of freedom?

I wasn't attacking you. I *was* attacking the OP who is fond of  
telling everyone to 'practice what they preach'. And I was pointing  
out that *he* is not practicing what he preaches. And, yes, it is a  
personal attack. I don't appreciate being called a hypocrite or  
selfish by hypocrites. I don't appreciate people who mindlessly  
attack the BSD license, when they themselves daily use BSD software  
like apache, perl, php, python, postgres, subversion etc etc etc. Yes  
- propagate your views with passion. But refrain from calling people  
hypocrites or selfish. For your information even the FSF has  
recognised the BSD license as Free Software - not that I give a damn  
whether they recognise it, but the OP subscribes to that camp, so  
should heed what they say.

hi,

the conference wiki is guarded from spammers by akismet. Hence it is  
necessary to enter information in the preferences page so that  
akismet can allow editing. Once preferences are set, they should  
persist. I find that after some time the preferences info vanishes  
from my browser. Has anyone else noticed this? I was asked to install  
Firebug to monitor the presence/absence of cookies, but I cant seem  
to figure out exactly how to do this with firebug. Can anyone check  
out and see a. if there is a problem and b. what causes it.

I request everyone, when you express your opinion, concentrate only
on that and give more supportive points to that. It will help us to
take the decision and discussion will not deviate from the topic.

Don't criticize or flame the other idea or other person.  Bcoz that
is not going to help in anyway.

So forgive, forget and come back to the topic. :)

Nautilus does a pretty good job. You can browse the remote machine by
pressing Ctrl+L and typing ssh://<machinename>/, and cut-copy-paste to
it like a normal folder. Of course, it uses ssh as a backend, so its
pretty secure.

I hope, the current font is Bilingual and it uses the Upper half of 
the ASCII for Tamil char. Try to change the font.

        That seems like a very ineffective way of debating al sides of a
 question.  Pointing out flaws in an argument is very useful in actually
 arriving at the correct course of action. There is no reason to descend
 into argumentum ad populum, argumentum ad ignorantiam argumewntum ad
 hominem, argumentum ad verecundiam, reductio ad Hitlerum or any other
 logical fallacy.  Are we stating we are unable engage in debate?

        Why are you so afraid of reasoned discourse?

        Booze?

        The topic is why a free software conference does not have a free
 license on the intellectual property donated to it by the creator.  And
 your comments on the topic are?

        At this point, the creator has little legal standing to define
 the license, since the copyright was already assigned. The copyright
 holders are the ones I am asking.

Hi All,
  I am sorry for suggesting this late, but it is worth to discuss.  
India does not have any conference called "Open Source Developers 
Conference", whereas Australia, Taiwan, Israel, and may be some other 
countries have OSDC.  Why not we call FossConf as OSDC India ?  This 
will receive global visibility.  I'm right now in Brisbane attending 
OSDC 2007, and it is a very big event in Australia.  This way we will 
become a part of "Open Source Developers Club". More info at
http://www.osdcon.org/wiki/

I do understand that things have gone a little far. Renaming the 
conference may be very difficult at this stage. We can consider it as an 
option for next year, or conduct another conference or something similar.

I suggest conducting our own conference here in India.  Task force is
to be setup..

The need of the hour is that if we attempt to do everything ourselves,
we would not be able to do much.. If we concentrate on bringing people
together, making them interact with each other, then a lot of
developments will happen..

Particularly, we need to cache in on the College professors.

It just striked to me..  If Scilab is not user friendly, why cant it
be taken as an academic project, to make it userfriendly..

I personally, feel, a record number of Academic projects can be taken
for improvement of existing open source softwares, to bring it on par
with the windows one..

Probably, industry professionals, who are already in FOSS can help
budding/interested students from 2nd year, to do it as long time
project.

That's 100% correct..  I too have experienced it..  the professors and
lecturers currently, wish to improve on their knowledge, that would
enhance their career, rather than their technical capability..  This
is majorly due to the fact that the professors were simply expected to
deliver information rather than solutions.

But, let's consistently strike the rock.. it will give in some days :)
.. i am doing that.. whenever i find opportunities, i just speak about
various FOSS softwares, trying to map their requirements.

For now, we can go with atleast the developers here.  FOSSCONF would
be a preliminary for such developers meet, i feel.

Senthil

the problem is that scilab does not permit distribution with  
modification - which is why it is not free software. However, octave  
does have a gui - koctave. I dont know how user friendly it is, but  
definitely worth working on

I agree. But mostly this type of discussions are going (away) from the
topic to person flaming. That is bad and We have to stop that kind of
discussion at some point.

> your comments on the topic are?

My personal choice is CC or GFDL.

But as Conf organizer, How do you protect that the same logo is NOT
used for a Conf/Event with same name, but expanded like "Frustrated
Open Source Software user Conf". Do we need to worry about this?

        The same arguments would also apply to other software, no?  How
 Do I know that people will no take this thing called Linux, and  use it
 in some other OS, called perhas "free software like Linux sux"?

        In my opinion, this is not something to worry about.  Firstly,
 this is unlikely, secondly, so what? Thirdly, closed licenses are
 unlikely to dissuade people that childish; you are mostly restricting
 people who would follow the legal issues.

        When you release free software for use byy other people, others
 realize you are not responsible for whatever use people make of things
 you are freely giving to the world.

        What is the downside?

it is not - in fact octave is a complete solution except for very  
highend specialised things. But it is not as easy to use as Matlab.  
But you have to pay for matlab - you do not have to pay for octave.  
It is your call.

this is not correct - FOSS is free - but not cheap. Initial costs of  
deploying FOSS are much higher than that of proprietary software.  
Only in the long run it works out cheaper (lower TCO)

I was doing some research and find that most people tend to license  
their logos as they license their software - with the exception of  
Mozilla and Linux foundation who are very strict. And, of course,  
Debian! Anyway our logo is composed of a Bharatanatyam mudra - which  
is thousands of years old and cannot be claimed by anyone, and a  
pottu which is worn by millions of women all over the world - again  
cannot be claimed by anyone. It is quite possible that a combination  
of the two has already been used - maybe in hundreds of ways. So lets  
license it under the BSD license - which is the freest of all  
licenses - and make everyone happy. After all, we cannot really  
justify any sort of restriction on the use, commercial or otherwise,  
of pottu and mudra.

This is a good decision. I wasn't telling BSD license is not good, I
was referring to people's attitude - we want to get stuff under BSD
and we will give back non-free. BSD license is a Free Software license
and I don't have any issues with even though I won't use it for my own
software I respect people's choice (as long as it is any Free Software
license).

These are not the same as a FOSS guy "choosing" to go non-free where
he have the authority to decide.

Subject: [Ilugc] Why FOSS for Education, a presentation in PDF format
Message-ID: <20071127133555.7C4C51DB257@www.ae.iitm.ac.in>


1. document in pdf format which is proprietory

The presentation/document will be released under FDL soon, after making necessary modifications.

2. Page 4 talks abt Lower Costs. it is mentioned that Initial Cost of
acquiring FOSS is much lower. what about TCO?
3. i disagree with second paragragh on page 6. where it says that FOSS
performs better than the proprietory softwares....
If in doubt, pl. go through the statistics given by David Wheeler at www.dwheeler.com

5. page 15. Linux is not the server OS. its a kernel.
In my programme, I clarify the students that, Linux is just a kernel and not operating system.

6. page 15. Apache is not a web server. Its a collection of projects. say it
as Apache HTTP Server Project. how do you know that it is #1 web server one
the internet?
The statistics were taken from www.dwheeler.com

7. page 16. MySQL's market share could never grow faster than windows.:)
please correct it. i think you want to compare with MSSQL.
Yes, the comparison was made with MS-SQL only.

8. page 62. scilab demo seems to be taken from windows vista.
Scilab and gCAD3d screenshots were taken from the project websites and not captured under F-7.

4. page 10 says rms started developing a free operation system called GNU
which is wrong. rms started a GNU project to create a unix-like operation
system. more over rms and linus did not plan and started the project. i
think its a grammer mistake

The above was included for an average computer student to understand that, most of the
FOSS developments were initially developed in an academic environment and nothing else.

9. for GIMP and Inkscape, QCAD, please change the title. for GIMP you could 
say Graphical Image manipulation Program, for Inkscape, Vector Drawing
Program. in first few slides, you have said that FOSS performs better than
proprietary and here you are promoting using proprietary software names. i
agree it will catch people's mind but lets tell them what it is...

The students whom I am focussing were much exposed to Proprietory software by their 
names.  So, it becomes necessary to have a comparison of name with the equivalent
proprietory softwares and I have never used/recommended the proprietory softwares I have mentioned
in the slide.  (My company's policy is strictly not to use proprietory software for any work).

11. BOSS is not a popular linux i guess...check here
http://linux.about.com/od/popular_distros/Popular_Linux_Distributions.htm

BOSS was included not because of its popularity. To make aware among the students that, India
too has its own distribution called BOSS (Bharat Operating System Solutions).


12. in experts excerpt, can u please keep kalam's talk first
ok, the students pay more attention for Kalam's talk when shown in the last, and nothing else.

13. page 131 says "New technology developments using FOSS.". can you tell me
what are all new developments going on?

1.  We have developed a new storage/backup solution completed based on free softwares.

Samba + Rsync + Heartbeat Clustering.

The above setup will ensure 99.9% of Reliable Data backup for organisations of any size (SME/Large Enterprises) when combined with Heartbeat clustering.

2. We have developed our own Terminal Server solution based on Free softwares (for Linux / Windows Servers) which we have
given freely to many Engineering / Arts and Science Colleges in Tamilnadu to setup FOSS Labs.

3. We also have a huge collection of FOSS softwares about 4000 GB, which you can browse the list at

http://www.chennailug.org/wiki/?title=CDs_for_Grab#Pazhavanthangal

Any institution in Tamilnadu can get the Free softwares from us totally free of cost.

Check out sshfs.
Once you mount a remote folder using sshfs, any local file manager can 
be used to browse the mountpoint.
Also, I think gftp has an option to select SSH2 as the protocol used.

        I suppose this is subjective. I have found myself far more
 productive on UNIX/Linux products, than I ever have been on Windows
 derived products, often because I can tweak the software to behave in a
 manner that increases my efficiency.

        YMMV.

        Well, RMS did start to develop a free OS called GNU -- except that
 the kernel was supposed to be the HURD. Linux came out of nowhere, and
 succeeded, while the HURD remains a experimental kernel.

Isn't FOSS.in objective in the same line?  From what I have read about 
the conference, the target audience is OSS developers.

It will be more useful, if you could prepare atleast few students for long
term projects..  The students would have no idea on how to start  a
project..

SO we could do some research on how to bring interested newbies, gradually
and step by step, towards participating in any of the major open source
projects.

The base line here is that in addition to imparting knowledge, we need to
mentor few students there, who after getting enough exposure to the FOSS
projects, will in turn, train their juniors, before they leave the college.

By this, we can create replicating talent centers in more colleges, and then
later co-ordinate their activities.


Just my thoughts, which i wished to implement in the near future.

Regards,
Senthil

Which means your connection is ok, "/etc/resolv.conf" and "/sbin/route
-n" are correct. Can you post output of:

  cat /etc/resolv.conf
  /sbin/route -n

You can save outputs to a file:

  /sbin/route -n > route.txt

Can you check your browser settings?

We have been making some efforts at NRCFOSS as part of our HR development
activities (FOSS in curriculum, lab courses, projects, etc.). The following
links are available for students to interact with us and the community.

http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/ProjectIdeas
http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/ProjectGuidelines

We draw upon LUG and others groups for mentorship and ideas while we could
take care of the regular monitoring, organizing lecturers, etc.

The students / staff could send a mail to <nrcfoss@au-kbc.in> for further
steps.

LJ Tech Tip: Can't Get Enough of Aliases

Aliases are really handy, if you seldom use the command line and your
memory is as bad as mine. They are also an essential time saving tool if
you live on the command line. But, they clutter up your command line
history file and make it harder to use, too.

There is a bash setting that can be used to prevent this by excluding some
of the more common commands like ls, etc.... Ones that you don't really
need in the history file. If you list all of your aliases there it will
exclude them as well. If you can remember an alias' name you don't need to
look it up in the history. :-)

If you put these two entries in your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc file the
following environment variables will be available every time you start up a
shell, and really reduce history clutter.

export HISTCONTROL=erasedups
export HISTIGNORE="dir*:cd *:ls*:less *:&"

HISTCONTROL=erasedups is an option that removes all previous duplicate
lines before saving to the history list. The option "ignorespace" prevents
lines which begin with a space from being saved in the history list. This
allows you, on an individual basis, to select which commands go into the
history file by putting a space before the command.

HISTIGNORE="" takes a list of commands (including shell wildcards) that you
don't want in the historyfile. A colon is used as the separator and "&" is
a special symbol that causes history to ignore consequtive duplicate
commands.

When HISTIGNORE is used with SUSE 10.3, there has to be a space before the
"*" in the commands cd and less -- but if you used a space with dir or ls,
it did not work properly. So you will have to do a little experimenting and
testing to get it working the way you want.

To immediately reload changes in ~/.bashrc, simply type source ~/.bashrc
and press enter, in a terminal window.

HTH :)

Nice presentation. Since these are students, it would possibly be good 
to spend some time and talk about how open source developments actually 
take place - group dynamics, foundries, participation modes etc. It 
would be worthwhile to mention that Anjuta was started by an Indian.

Participation in OSS development gives them experience that they will 
find difficult to get elsewhere. Mention of NRCFOSS as a place where 
this can be done will be useful.

Bootloaders on the pendrives decide the booting options.

In my puppylinux pendrive, I put syslinux. I think syslinux supports only
USB-HDD.

If anyone know more about other bootloaders please share..

Did you tried Damn Small Linux (DSL)?

*DSL is a very versatile 50MB mini desktop oriented Linux distribution.*

Damn Small is small enough and smart enough to do the following things:

   - Boot from a business card CD as a live linux distribution (LiveCD)
   - Boot from a USB pen drive
   - Boot from within a host operating system (that's right, it can run
   *inside* Windows)
   - Run very nicely from an IDE Compact Flash drive via a method we call
   "frugal install"
   - Transform into a Debian OS with a traditional hard drive install
   - Run light enough to power a 486DX with 16MB of Ram
   - Run fully in RAM with as little as 128MB (you will be amazed at how
   fast your computer can be!)
   - Modularly grow -- DSL is highly extendable without the need to
   customize

In the 3rd slide itself, the presentation gives more importance for the 4 software freedoms, I hope that,
this itself registers in people's mind strongly, before going ahead with cost.

An ascii art of your network topology would have given a much clearer  
picture and help us understand your problem.  BTW, I am curious as to 
why you have complicated your network so much?  Is this a lab 
assignment question?

This is a class B network 172.16.0.0 unless you are subnetting it.

So does your proxy have 2 NICs?  one bridged to the DSL modem and acting 
as WAN interface and the other one connected to your own "router" 
system?

The proxy server needs to know that 192.168.1.0 network is behind 
172.16.1.1 (man route on how to do this).  Otherwise how will the proxy 
know where to send the packets for 192.168.1.0?  Alternately, do NAT on 
your "router" system on iface 172.16.1.1 - all traffic from 192.168.1. 
will appear as coming from 172.16.1.1

> in present case , i 
> want to redirect 192.168.1.2 to 172.16.1.1:3128 to access net..

Do not understand what you are trying to do here.  Suggest, first solve 
your basic routing table entries and then tackle above.

> ISP has given two dns address & one router address.

This would be on the proxy server.  Your def gw on the 192.168.1. 
network s/b 192.168.1.1 and on the 172.16. network s/b 172.16.10.1

Let us know when you solve the problem (along with your solution) to 
help others who may run into a similar issue.

two LANS-192.168.1.0 series and 172.16.1.0 series
one proxy server whose ip is 172.16.10.1 is connected to braodband internet
(modem)..
one system acting as router has eth0=172.16.1.1 & eth1=192.168.1.1
172.16.1.1 system is getting net via 172.16.10.1
the 192.168.1.2 client is not able to access the internet...is it possible
to acess internet via 192.168.1.1...?
in present case , i want to redirect 192.168.1.2 to 172.16.1.1:3128 to
access net..


Well i think i understand  it now .did you enable ip forwarding in the
system having the two Ethernet cards?

And make sure that the gateway is defined. check the  out put of the route
command to make this sure.

Raj

 Why wait till next year ? You can create a sub/mini conference this
year under fossconf. You need to do the following

0) Gather momentum for the idea.
1) Identify the agenda for the sub-conf
2) Identify the infrastructure required and approach the organizers
for arranging the infrastructure.
3) Identify the speakers and decide whether you want it to be a invite
only speakers or any one can become a speaker.
4) Create a procedure for verifying the credentials for the chosen speakers

You have 2 months to market the subconf if you act now. So, lets not
wait a whole year...

 Azureus will not automatically change firewall settings. Are you sure
you did not change anything ? Also, try turning off UnPnP from the
router.

 As a first measure just check your

1) Routing settings
2) Nameservers
3) Proxy settings. (carefully check if you made any environmental wide
proxy settings).

Also, please upgrade the box, azureus version in ubuntu 6.06 is old and buggy.

 Can you open website from command line browsers like lynx and elinks
? If not then you need to contact the ISP.

This happened to me when the nameservers weren't working. Just switch
to 10.94.0.31 or 32, and things should go fine.

Message-ID: <69621d830711291220l69f0a92am2af31cb1bf0f98c8@mail.gmail.com>

I have been facing a funny problem regarding video files. Say, i want to
play the file *abc.mpg *with *vlc player. *I played it, no problem; but
instead of *stop it*, i clicked in the "x" button of the right top side of
this player. Ok..fine...
Now, next of this if i wanna play another video file ( it may be anything...
from hard drive or from dvd player ), there is no colour and it is same for
every video player in my system like mplayer,totem.  That means, it becomes
"black and white". Now, if i reboot my system and tries to play that
file/files again, it seems ok. But, if i push the "x" button instead of
"stop" button, problem occurs again.  Every other colours like theme
colour,icon colour and others  are ok; even the thumbnail of the video is
also coloured.

What should i am goona do. I cannot find *proper keyword* to search it in
google. :)

Does this happen only when you play a video initially using VLC ?

You can try changing the video output device.

I have Debian Testing on the same laptop, and it is working without this
problem. It uses the same nameservers as my Debian 4.0, so the problem
cannot be in the nameservers.

Anyway, I tried the nameservers that you gave, but it did not help. By the
way, who is running those (10.94.0.31 or 32)?
