{"From": "kprawinmail@gmail.com", "content": "hi gentleman,\ni'm extremely sorry that my english is too bad that everyone\nmisunderstand my idea. I dont mean that the mentors have to spoonfeed\nthe students through blogs. I never mean that i should get honey\nsitting in my place itself. Even i hate tasting honey without some of\nmy effort in getting it. Let me explain what i really mean.\nSuppose, you are a mentor with skills in javascript and xml. And you\nhave created an orkut application.\nNow your blog will contain the following info. .\n* project title, description\n* tools and technology used (here js,xml)\n* detailed description (about 10-15lines)\n* pre requistics to get through the project (here, knowledge of js,\nxml, a google account, webspace to hold application)\n* links for source code, documentation etc. .\nAnd thats it. Now we can examine the pre requistics, get knowledge\nthrough internet, practice some sample codes and then get into the\nproject.\nIf i want to develop an orkut application, i dont have to disturb you.\nI can go through your blog, get an idea, practice it and get back to\nyou if i get any doubts.\nInstead of one person personaly contacting a mentor, and some other\nday someone again contacting same mentor, for same reason then it\nkills some time of the mentor. If the discussion is open, anyone can\nknow it, participate in it. . (that is real open source, right?).\nInfact, the mailing list is a good option for that, but searching the\nprevious mails, or repeating same questions will add little\ndifficulty.\nYou can notice some mails with the blog address of the mentor. So if\nneed that project later, i have to search my mailbox again or post a\nmail again regarding the project. So, i suggest to add the blog\naddress along with the mentor name, mail id, and technology which is\nalready there.\nAnd dear gentlemen and good ladies, I personaly apologize to each one\nof you, if I mean anything wrong. Im really sorry.\nRegards,\nK.Prawin\n", "References": ["AANLkTimRKvz_AH39AX8CgJriq8gm869Svf+NvK02VVtx@mail.gmail.com", "AANLkTimFi76jpZosb1dKZTQeqYG9069jickqRRZ2WQ34@mail.gmail.com", "4CF52F3C.1050200@gmail.com"], "In-Reply-To": ["4CF52F3C.1050200@gmail.com"], "Date": "2010-12-01T22:08:24", "Message-ID": "AANLkTin0zeYMrB26audGp7Mj1AxoBrByH3EgVoa3Vn3O@mail.gmail.com", "Subject": "[Ilugc] Mentoring students for Projects"}

{"From": "kumaran@techie.com", "content": "\n\nHi,\n\n     This mail is to inform all members of ILUGC about Bhavan's (my school) Young Indian's Educational Fair.\n\n        One of the leading complaints of people whom I have switched to    FOSS is that there is virtually no \"local PC guy\" who knows FOSS    software. So, if they call them up for some help, they just    reinstall *Windows*. So, I realized the need for \"Local PC guys\" who    know FOSS. I saw the opportunity for that in the EduFair.\n\n        EduFair is a Educational Fair (you guessed it right) for school    drop-outs from slums of near-by areas for our school. It gives them    a chance to work and make a living. NGOs would be offering them    various options in the field of vocational training. Around 500+    school drop-outs would be attending the EduFair.\n\n        I thought ILUGC would be a great \"NGO\" in teaching them various    simple FOSS skills like installing and configuring Ubuntu, etc.,    Zoho (the SAAS Office Provider) is also coming. I hope the kind    hearted persons in ILUGC would be able to teach them the basic    skills that \"The Local PC Guy\" requires. The main problem as far as    I can see now, is getting \"The Local PC Guys\" to accept that there    are better software that is free. We don't have to make the school    drop-outs unlearn the conventional *Windows* tricks. It would be    good deed to us all, because we can start consuming the resources    offered by the new FOSS-trained \"Local PC Guys\". By the way, it's    not going to be free, and we can expect Yi Net to give some money    for the training purposes. The event is to be held on the coming    Sunday.

Local domains\nas a declaration only tells fetchmail or postfix which mail domains it\nshould consider as local for local delivery as opposed to outside delivery\nusing SMTP.\n\nIn Postfix/sendmail, you will need a unique local user for every email id in\nevery domain if you want them as separate boxes. A pattern I used to follow\nwas name_domain for the user name. You will need to map the mail addresses\nto the real users using the virtusertable file. Then you will see mails\ngetting delivered properly to the real users. In the absence of the\nvirtusertable, postfix simply strips the domain to figure out the username\nand delivers it to that user.\n\nHaving just email ids also will not allow users to login unless they have\nreal users. I had for long searched for a module that allows folks to login\nusing their email addresses as opposed to their real user names (useful for\na mail only system) and found a couple of web frontends that did it by\nreading the mapping in virtusertable.\n\nMaybe some one in this list can write a PAM module for this purpose.\n\n-- Mohan Sundaram\n", "References": ["AANLkTi=8rbg2+DyGOZqW7Fxo=JMCBxpY+W3-nLUTdzgs@mail.gmail.com"], "In-Reply-To": ["AANLkTi=8rbg2+DyGOZqW7Fxo=JMCBxpY+W3-nLUTdzgs@mail.gmail.com"], "Date": "2010-12-04T08:31:50", "Message-ID": "AANLkTi=dk-v7v+fUyQ0dJ8mvt_T_zDm9OsRN20msDt1b@mail.gmail.com", "Subject": "[Ilugc] Fetching email from catch-all account"}

{"From": "kumaran@techie.com", "content": "Hi,\n\n\n     Automatic updates are very important for any computer connected to the internet. But most of the Windows machines disable it due to the \"Windows Genuine Advantage\" problem. Further, with Linux you will need to install software from the on-line repository which will also consume your download limit. I strongly suggest you to go for an unlimited connection. You can also try other ISP like You telecom, Tikona, etc,. for cheaper unlimited connections.

What you are likely experiencing is the\nfirst stage of grub (from your Ubuntu install) trying to find the\nUbuntu boot files and not finding them.\n\nI would suggest that you use a rescue CDROM/USB stick and repair the\ngrub with \"grub-install\"  *or* edit the grub line to point to\nfilenames installed by CentOS (vmlinuz image and the initrd ramdisk\nfile).  If this seems to be a daunting task then reinstall CentOS and\nwatch for any errors (if any).\n\nGood luck.\n\n-- Arun Khan\n", "References": ["AANLkTimPf+NKoxtXw_m0+NkdBFTrJ+ry3a=DRFSxAsUb@mail.gmail.com", "AANLkTimDJg7eZXgaKd4uYmPG1h-=g+Wbok=UJc3xxjHX@mail.gmail.com", "AANLkTinN5V-hEbwKEaN_zu3HgT6pQ2s5BEBUDphpj+b6@mail.gmail.com"], "In-Reply-To": ["AANLkTinN5V-hEbwKEaN_zu3HgT6pQ2s5BEBUDphpj+b6@mail.gmail.com"], "Date": "2010-12-06T20:04:55", "Message-ID": "AANLkTikcxCUp9ajJdQegS6n67nUeZqAQ=8h5HcdiCFAf@mail.gmail.com", "Subject": "[Ilugc] Blue screen error in Centos 5.5 ."}

This is due to\nTCP ACKs not getting thro'. TCP window scaling sees that there is no\navailable bandwidth\n and falls short of available bandwidth in a big way.\n\nThis is why bittorrent affects other downloads since it uploads whilst\ndownloading.\n\nNow the best way to tackle this situation is to have a firewall kind\nof device in between\n to insure that fair allocation is done otherwise known as QoS.\n\nQoS works to a reasonable degree since IP networks are by definition\nuncontrollable beasts.\n\nI have not had much success controlling it but with an intermediate\ndevice like a firewall\nto arbiter traffic/bandwidth allocation we can get a lot more leeway\nthan otherwise.\n\nThere is much more to it but for now I will stop.\n\n-Girish\n\n\n-- \nGayatri Hitech\n\nhttp://gayatri-hitech.com\ngirish@gayatri-hitech.com\n", "References": ["AANLkTin+-nzAAAMU5ZJbxU1vbQj03pShz2OHTjM-67L9@mail.gmail.com"], "In-Reply-To": ["AANLkTin+-nzAAAMU5ZJbxU1vbQj03pShz2OHTjM-67L9@mail.gmail.com"], "Date": "2010-12-08T07:38:57", "Message-ID": "AANLkTikkKTH5_Hz1UukNFLog6fr5vcLNUbxYK837S69B@mail.gmail.com", "Subject": "[Ilugc] How to share the Internet Bandwith equally -reg."}

This is exactly the type of question to ask when dealing with \nperformance. Most people forget that the precursor to performance tuning is \nperformance measurement. Trying to tune something just based on gut instinct is \nlike shooting in the dark hoping you hit your target. With proper benchmarking \nyou can, for example, come to a conclusion that there aren't really any high \ngains to be achieved by optimizing that small bit of code where the application \nspends just 5% of the time but you can possibly improve I/O throughput 20% by \njust by tweaking a vm parameter.\n\nNow, that said, you should understand 'performance' is a very generic broad \nterm. Try to answer the question -- What is it that you wish to tune for ? \nEventually you shall always end up making trade-offs. For instance, you could \nmake gains in I/O or network throughput but that will come at at the cost of \nmemory footprint or higher CPU requirements.\n\n> please let me know do we have guidelines , tools to identify these kind of\n> improvements inside the c/c++ code .\n>\n> any tools or guidelines will be helpful\n>\n> i have used vmstat/netstat/iostat for whole system but i  need on application\n> basis  .\n\nIf you think about it, your application is no different from any other \napplication from the system's point of view. So you can't just measure your \napplication in an isolated manner. That will just give you wrong metrics. You \nhave to consider measuring both the performance of the system as well as your \napplication in it's natural work environment to be able to correctly judge what \nyou can tune. So, use the tools you mentioned in conjunction with others for \nyour application.\n\nOk, talk aside - here are the tools that might help:\n\na. Start simple -- use time, strace (-C option) and ltrace (-c option) to get an \nidea where your time is being spent.\nb. Use top/pmap in batch-mode over the life time of your application to see \nwhere and how memory is being used.\nc. Use something like oprofile to get any idea of the environment that your \napplication functions in.\nd. Use system-tap to instrument the measurement of whatever parameters you are \ninterested in measuring.\ne. Use tcpdump/wireshark along with netstat to get an idea of actual bottlenecks \nin network traffic.\n\nOnce you've collected your data, identify the 'hot-spots' and check to see \nwhether you can optimize anything there. There are tons of resources online to \nhelp you depending entirely on what you wish to optimize for.\n\nFinally here's a site that you might want to take some time to go through:\nhttp://www.performancewiki.com/\n\n\ncheers,\n- steve\n\n-- \nrandom spiel: http://lonetwin.net/\nwhat i'm stumbling into: http://lonetwin.stumbleupon.com/\n", "References": ["516201.98911.qm@web94713.mail.in2.yahoo.com"], "In-Reply-To": ["516201.98911.qm@web94713.mail.in2.yahoo.com"], "Date": "2010-12-08T13:38:05", "Message-ID": "4CFF3CB7.30902@lonetwin.net", "Subject": "[Ilugc] c/C++ code performace tuning for network and i/o"}

From the ACPI wikipedia entry:\n-------------------------------------------------\nIn computing, the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) \nspecification provides an open standard for unified operating system-centric \ndevice configuration and power management. [...snip...] The standard was \noriginally developed by Intel, Microsoft, and Toshiba ...\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nand then right there in the first section itself ...\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nSome software developers have trouble implementing ACPI and express concerns \nabout the requirements that bytecode from an external source must be run by the \nsystem with full privileges.[5] Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel, \nonce described it as \"a complete design disaster in every way\", in relation to \nhis view that \"modern PCs are horrible\".[6]\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, it is not like acpi has to be /compiled/ with a M$ compiler (I am not even \nsure what that is supposed to mean). It is more like ACPI has to be \n/implemented/ using a 600 page specification designed by M$, which almost \nnecessitates the acpi subsystem to include an entire freaking 'parser' as a \ndriver[2] if one wants to use it as intended.\n\nOf course, as is M$'s nature, their idea of a specification is stuff that others \nought to implement although they are free to make exceptions and since h/w \nmanufactures are happy just confirming to the M$ subset of the specifications, \nimplementations that do actually confirm to the specification still might not \nwork as expected. ...sigh.\n\ncheers,\n- steve\n\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface\n[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACPI_Machine_Language#Firmware_Interface\n     http://www.advogato.org/article/913.html\n\n-- \nrandom spiel: http://lonetwin.net/\nwhat i'm stumbling into: http://lonetwin.stumbleupon.com/\n", "References": ["AANLkTin+fCcJKrWr6zhm44ynUSaQBaxj_9HeLu+xaNCg@mail.gmail.com"], "In-Reply-To": ["AANLkTin+fCcJKrWr6zhm44ynUSaQBaxj_9HeLu+xaNCg@mail.gmail.com"], "Date": "2010-12-13T21:28:01+05:30", "Message-ID": "4D064289.5060503@lonetwin.net", "Subject": "[Ilugc] Influence of M$ on hardware"}

Didn't know you\nwere critical on proprietary s/w (even if it might convince newbies to start\nusing Linux). There were a lot of threads about Oracle, proprietary games,\netc discussed if I remember well. That gave me an impression that the group\nis not very critical of proprietary software. Most people (serious users\ndoing serious businesses) would definitely not adopt Free Software just\nbecause it gives them freedom. They'd go for it if the software is\ntechnically superior in some way.

If it comes to\nconvincing them to switch to Linux on grounds that their favourite\nproprietary software works on Linux, I'm very much OK with it. I'd tell\nsomeone to switch to Linux by convincing them that Picasa works on Linux!\nLater, I would definitely let them know of F-SPOT, Shotwell etc. to get them\nto switch to Free software. And then comes the preaching about FOSS part.\nBut evangelism comes last, getting them to start using Linux or some free\nsoftware is the priority and then the rest of the aspects will be\nautomatically discovered. I've been successful in doing this is what I was\ntrying to say. I was not promoting proprietary software and have no intent\nof doing so in the future. I was merely clarifying the stands of the people\nof this list.  Just my two cents..\n\nAnd I'd love to have some pointers to the objectives, values, etc of this\nlist !

As for LDAP administration, there are several\nclients - LAM (php based, Apache DS client (needs JRE).\n\nBTW, I am assuming you have a DNS server for the domain you plan to\nimplement in the LDAP server.\n\nI hope the above is enough to get you going.

You can do remote\ndesktop to a machine on public ip open on internet and you have\nsufficient credentials and needed ports are open. For this we already\nhave solutions in place like remote desktop (RDC, remote desktop\nconnection) for windows from Linux 9atleast it is available in ubuntu\nand fedora) and vnc and x11 are available in Linux. But what\nteamviewer does that is not available in other tools is that it make\nsession sharing possible over port 80 (i think so), it is able to\nnavigate through proxies. This remote desktop sharing is made possible\nby creating a invisble vpn session and that session is given to only a\nGUI that does remote desktop and file transfer and remote audio\npossible. So analysing protocols willl be long way to do it. Instead\nwe should be able to reverse engineer the product, like the way gnu\nmakes many of its things work on windows and build a opensource\nquivalent.\n\nwith regards,\nashwin\n", "References": ["AANLkTi=a0VBOMiHtK+iQizWF3xyijScVAWGsh=GixN8i@mail.gmail.com", "AANLkTimB=SJQ+j-VVqk1Z75tLDENkOjZDGBqKjKL3UWS@mail.gmail.com", "AANLkTimSJ4NDLvQXOhUL21F-88dzfa_1BnQZyBOtYL59@mail.gmail.com", "AANLkTik2k8K1D7mC6dTqmdpbpfo+b1FAMRfyn40vvV22@mail.gmail.com"], "In-Reply-To": ["AANLkTik2k8K1D7mC6dTqmdpbpfo+b1FAMRfyn40vvV22@mail.gmail.com"], "Date": "2010-12-17T19:51:23+05:30", "Message-ID": "AANLkTinoCmHKeVqd-g3baHts5CDyMVdSrmezR5x0kf3h@mail.gmail.com", "Subject": "[Ilugc] creating a FOSS alternate for Teamviewer"}

In India we have a habit of\ngoing for the 'most popular'. For example a car mechanic will refer to\nthe starter as a 'Delco'. It is not a Delco - delco was a popular brand\nof starter which had a monopoly at one time. Similarly people do not say\n'web browser' - they say IE or firefox.

Given a cycle length or statistics for\nseveral periods, it can calculate the days until menstruation, the\ndays of \"safe\" sex, the fertile period, and the days to ovulations,\nand define the d.o.b. of a child. It allows the user to write notes\nand helps to supervise the administration of hormonal contraceptive\ntablets.\n\nPossibilities of the program:\n\n  - Calculate days of menstruation, based on the length of the cycle\nor on statistics of previous periods.\n  - Calculate days of \"safe\" sex, fertile period and day to ovulations.\n  - Definition of D.O.B. (Date Of Birth) of a child\n  - Allows to write notes.\n  - Helps to supervise reception of hormonal contraceptive tablets.\n  - Multiple users allowed.

Acer is certainly the hottest. Specifically, the 12\" TM 6292,\nwhich is my main laptop becomes uncomfortably hot to even to touch.\n\nI often run a script that generates dummy data for my application and when I\ndo that, it gets so hot I have to move over to the other laptop! The CPU\ntemp goes above 85 deg C and the skin temp should be around 40-50 deg C!\n\nTo be fair, my other laptop, an Aspire 4736Z does not get so hot - but I do\nnot use it for heavy duty stuff!\n\nregds,\nmano\n\n\n> --\n>\nComputers are useless.

If i take a BE and take a BSc and put them on a programming job, Bsc Maths might do better because Science graduates in literal sense are better thinkers than engineering guys.(No offence meant to engg Graduates.)\n\n\n", "In-Reply-To": ["AANLkTikvLQd30+O6PYzgK9ORvGULDD4QM9NH=nB-DmF6@mail.gmail.com"], "Date": "2010-12-25T20:37:27+05:30", "Message-ID": "586547.21882.qm@web95703.mail.in.yahoo.com", "Subject": "[Ilugc] [JOB] Ruby on Rails freshers"}

The work that the westerners hate to do is outsourced to india due to cheap labour. which is unfortunately hyped up by the software giants. You can use a 10th or 12th std qualified student for nearly 75% of the tasks that is being done by a BE in big software companies in india.\n\n\n", "In-Reply-To": ["AANLkTi=21Rj7Kw6r6ThhS--NRhzcekRFocksVeMyg5+0@mail.gmail.com"], "Date": "2010-12-26T11:58:07+05:30", "Message-ID": "318688.39474.qm@web95705.mail.in.yahoo.com", "Subject": "[Ilugc] [JOB] Ruby on Rails freshers"}

Android is having the backing of a giant in google and today 1 in 4 smartphones sold is a android phone.\nIt was an excellent strategy to release a Linux based OS by Google in Android and OEMs grabbed it.\nCommon Man does not asks that he needs android and kernel version 2.6.32 etc.\nThe same is not True with respect to Laptops. still windows rules.\nThere is still no backing from a big guy.\n\nJust get out of your home spend time for 30 minutes to see for yourself on what OS goes into PCs or Laptops.\nI have also seen few people buying linux laptops (just to cut down few bucks) and load a pirated version of windows. \n\n\n", "In-Reply-To": ["1293351735.2026.42.camel@localhost"], "Date": "2010-12-26T19:32:42+05:30", "Message-ID": "838843.89223.qm@web95717.mail.in.yahoo.com", "Subject": "[Ilugc] Laptop for multipurpose usage"}

Increase this to IT norms and cars will\nbecome automatically much more expensive and will become unfordable to the\nmiddle class yet again. That's the reason why there has to be inclusive,\nsustainable growth (I have started to get a feeling that this is\nan oxymoron).

But the import duties have been like this for decades.\nGrowth in the auto sector has happened only in the last 15 years. It was a\nsustained effort by the state government of Tamil Nadu to get the auto\nmajors in. This is awesome. However corrupt either of the two major parties\nare, they did something which created a revolution. Giving employment to\nhundreds of thousands. I don't really care about corruption if it leads to\nprogress.\n\n\n\n> Hopefully, we can hope for better policy makers in the future,\n> who're not just looking to line their pockets.

Corruption almost always works to our benefit. I don't understand\nwhy people get worked up when they look at major scams. It's very\nhypocritical. It's a matter of scale. A drive from my office to home in\nChennai shows me that almost all road users violate all laws and have zero\ndiscipline and don't care about any etiquette on the road.

If you can provide genuine value to your \nemployer/customer/client, I think most of the money/success issues will \ntake care of themselves eventually.
